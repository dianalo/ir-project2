This year, forecasting the weather for planting andgrowing seasons is unusually challenging, say some long-rangeforecasters.</LP><TEXT>   Paul Handler, editor of the Atlas Forecasts of Urbana,Ill., believes that the recent volcanic eruption of Mt.Pinatubo in the Philippines will greatly affect weatheraround the world. Though his views aren't shared by allforecasters, some traditional meteorologists agree with Mr.Handler's outlook for a spring that could be wet enough tointerfere with the planting of corn and soybeans.   &quot;The weather this winter and the rainfall in Californiaresemble what happened in 1983,&quot; following the eruption ofthe El Chichon volcano in Mexico, Mr. Handler says. He notesthat in 1983 California received above-average rainfall -- asit has this year to break five years of drought -- and themajor growing regions of the Midwest had a wet spring.   But even less beneficial weather patterns of 1983 also mayreturn. For instance, around July 1, 1983, &quot;it stoppedraining in the corn belt and hot, dry weather appeared andhurt corn pollination roughly south of Interstate 80,&quot; Mr.Handler says. He expects a similar pattern this year withhot, dry weather appearing in July and August in the corn andsoybean-growing areas of Illinois, Indiana and Iowa.   Kevin Marcus, director of Cropcast Services, a Rockville,Md., weather consulting firm, thinks the eruption of Mt.Pinatubo at about the time El Nino was beginning willincrease the intensity of this other weird-weather generator.El Nino is an abnormal warming of the equatorial Pacific,which produces long-range weather phenomena. The warmer thesewaters get, the more weather patterns are changed and themore growing conditions are affected.   Mr. Marcus agrees with Mr. Handler that the summer weatherin the U.S. will be more extreme than normal. &quot;We are goingto have a hot, dry period,&quot; he says. &quot;I just can't tell youwhat day it is going to start.&quot;   The timing of a hot spell is critical to crops. &quot;If youhave a heat wave in early June, compared to late June, theimpact on corn would be totally different,&quot; says John Davis,a meteorologist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. In late June,corn is in its most yield-sensitive stage.   In anticipation of weather troubles, Steve DeCook, anagricultural futures-market money manager in Ankeny, Iowa,has bought soybean futures contracts. But he hedged this betby selling call options against his futures position atexercise prices far above current levels. Though he agreeswith Mr. Handler's forecast of hot, dry weather in late Juneor early July, he doesn't expect soybean prices to risesignificantly soon. If prices do rise, the calls he soldwould be exercised, which limits the profits on his position.But if prices don't rise to exercise levels, he and hisclients keep the proceeds of selling the call options.   Meteorologist Harvey Freese of FreeseNotis, a commercialweather service in Des Moines, Iowa, says he will be watchingto see if April and May are cool and wet in the U.S. and themonsoon returns in India. If both situations occur, he wouldendorse forecasts of hot, dry conditions in late summer, ashappened in 1983.   The volatility of the weather is already having an effecton crops. Last week the sudden drop in temperatures in theTexas Panhandle, Oklahoma and southern Kansas probablydamaged the winter wheat crop, says Mr. Freese, though towhat extent won't be known for several weeks.   Thad Chupallo, meteorologist for Merrill Lynch Futures inNew York, says the northern spring-wheat regions, which havebeen dryer than normal this year, should benefit as the stormtrack seasonally shifts northward. One sign that the stormtrack is moving north is that southeastern North Dakota hasreceived one inch of moisture so far this month, comparedwith its normal 0.8 inch for all of March.   Mr. Handler cautions that if the volcanic material putinto the atmosphere by Mt. Pinatubo reduces sunlightsufficiently, there might not be enough energy to changeweather patterns as he anticipates. In that case, he says, adrought wouldn't occur.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Traders expect an Agriculture Department report scheduledfor release Friday to signal tight supplies of beef cattlethis spring.   Cash prices rose to strong levels last week in much of theMidwest as meatpackers competed with each other to buy enoughcattle to keep their plants operating efficiently.   Dan Vaught, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons,St. Louis, is projecting that the government's March 1 surveyof seven major ranch states will show that about 8% fewercattle were being fattened on feedlots for slaughter comparedwith the same date in 1991.   Mr. Vaught also expects the government to report thatranchers placed about 5% fewer young cattle onto feedlots inFebruary, and that the feedlots sold about 1% fewer cattle tomeatpackers compared with the same month in 1991.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          The slump in petroleum prices that followed last month'smeeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesmay have run its course, some oil analysts and traders say.They expect prices to firm after having been depressed forseveral weeks. &quot;Oil prices have found a `floor' and are morelikely to move up than down,&quot; reports the Energy Compass, aLondon-based oil industry publication.   There are some fundamental reasons behind suchprojections. There is evidence OPEC's high production isbeing trimmed, although the output cuts this month aren't asdeep as many would like to see. World oil inventories don'tappear burdensome despite the approach of the seasonallyslack demand period of the second quarter. In fact, &quot;leanglobal crude and product stocks keep the second-quarteroutlook fairly balanced,&quot; reports Energy Security Analysis, aWashington firm that monitors petroleum supplies around theworld.   But traders mainly cite technical factors for some of thenew strength in oil markets. U.S. futures trading ended lastweek on a firm note, for example, after the expiring Aprilcrude oil contract broke through the psychologicallyimportant level of $19 a barrel. April crude ended the weekon the New York Mercantile Exchange at $19.18 a barrel, up 35cents for the day. The May contract was up 33 cents to $19.35a barrel.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Traders will be watching for further declines in goldfutures today following losses late last week. On Friday,gold for April delivery finished 70 cents lower at $347.30 anounce. The decline came after a government report showed thatprice inflation at the producer level remained subdued inFebruary. One of the allures of gold is that it is viewed asa hedge against inflation. James Steel, an analyst at RefcoInc., said it is beginning &quot;to look a little dark for gold,&quot;because it failed to close above the technically important$348-an-ounce level Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
