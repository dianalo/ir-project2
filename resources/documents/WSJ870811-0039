The billion-dollar plan being drawn up by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would be the second-largest government bailout of a bank, second only to the 1984 rescue of Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago. The size of First City's aid package reflects financial deterioration of Texas's fourth-largest banking firm that has mirrored the weak Texas economy.    &quot;It's a deep hole&quot; at First City, said a banking official close to one of several groups considering a bid for the bank. And the problems seem to deepen by the quarter. A previously reported second-quarter net loss of $116.4 million gave the Houston-based banking firm a $160.9 million net loss for the first half of this year. It posted a $402 million loss for all of 1986. As the company has been buffeted by loan losses from energy and real estate lending, First City has said it can't predict when it will again show a profit.    Federal regulators customarily intervene to rescue a banking company when private investors are unwilling to inject funds of their own to acquire and recapitalize it. To head off the disruption caused by a large bank failure the FDIC tries to assist troubled institutions and new investors in an attempt to allow the bank to survive.    The prospect of a federally assisted takeover of First City comes as its capital base is eroding because of its losses.    First City, which has $12.5 billion in assets, has been soliciting investors for several months but has refused to indicate what progress, if any, it has made toward finding a long-term solution to its problems. But the FDIC, empowered with new emergency authorities under a banking law signed by the president yesterday, apparently is taking control of bidding for the company, sources say.    Now, says a banking official familiar with the FDIC's deliberations, &quot;It isn't relevant what management favors, it's what the FDIC wants.&quot; An FDIC official said the agency is weighing several alternatives for helping First City, including chartering a new national bank with new management to take control of First City's business and run it for as long as three years. That alternative, called a &quot;bridge bank,&quot; stems from the new banking law that took effect yesterday.    Also, one idea that has been used by the FDIC in Texas recently is for the agency to assist in a recapitalization of a troubled banking company with a group of private investors. &quot;We are not preparing just one plan,&quot; said a FDIC official. &quot;We're talking to a lot of people.&quot;    Among those in negotiations with the FDIC are the Bank of Scotland; an investor group led by A. Robert Abboud, former chairman of First Chicago Corp.; and an investor group being assembled by William M. Isaac, a former FDIC chairman who now is a banking consultant. The Bank of Scotland couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Abboud confirmed his interest in First City in June, but yesterday wouldn't comment further on the discussions. Mr. Isaac declined to comment.    It isn't clear which of the interests the FDIC favors or whether it will reject all of them and create a &quot;bridge bank.&quot; So far, however, the agency has rejected proposals from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a New York investment banking firm, which planned to assemble an investor group led by Robert J. Carney, a Houston businessman who helped create Texas Air Corp., a big airline holding company.    Sources also say that Citicorp contacted First City about a possible acquistion, and that MCorp, a Dallas-based banking company that itself is deeply troubled, solicited First City financial data with an eye toward a federally-assisted combination. But nothing appears to have developed at either banking firm. Both Citicorp and MCorp declined to comment.    First City also declined to comment on the FDIC's negotiations with possible bidders. &quot;We will only comment when we have something to announce,&quot; a spokesman said.    Whatever course the FDIC chooses, First City's management is likely to be pushed aside, because FDIC assistance usually requires new management. Also, individuals who have examined detailed data from First City estimate that the banking company may still be understating its loan problems. First City's nonperforming loans, those with interest payments at least 90 days past due, are likely to double from the $1.07 billion, or 11.4% of total loans, First City reported at June 30, a banking official familiar with the bidding predicted. &quot;I think anybody wants to be protected from further deterioration,&quot; an individual close to First City added. </TEXT></DOC>
