The only remaining obstacle, though still a substantialone, is the treaty governing air service between the U.S. andBritain. That pact names Pan Am and TWA as the only two U.S.carriers permitted to serve Heathrow. Talks to revise thetreaty to allow UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and AMR Corp.'sAmerican Airlines to replace them are scheduled to resumetomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   In recent days negotiators on both sides have becomeincreasingly optimistic that an agreement can be worked out,perhaps by the end of this week. That outlook reflects, inpart, high-level pressure brought to bear on the Britishgovernment in recent months. In December, President Bushbrought up the issue when Prime Minister John Major visitedhim at Camp David.   Secretary of State James Baker discussed the issue withBritish officials.   Vice President Dan Quayle underscored the administration'sinterest when he visited the prime minister in London earlierthis year. And 10 days ago, Transportation Secretary SamuelSkinner, in a telephone call with Malcolm Rifkind, theBritish secretary of state for transport, outlined a proposalthat appears to have gotten the foundering bilateralnegotiations back on the track.   Under that plan, United and American would temporarily belimited to the same number of flights that Pan Am and TWAcurrently offer from Heathrow.   The action taken by the British government yesterdaydoesn't directly involve the aviation treaty. Instead, itconcerns the airport traffic-distribution rules that havebeen in effect since the mid-1970s to prevent a worsening ofcongestion at Heathrow.   Under the rules, airlines that wanted to begin service toLondon were required to use Gatwick Airport. But Heathrowremained the preferred destination for many travelers,because of its abundant connections to the rest of Europe. Inmid-January, Britain's Civil Aviation Authority recommendedthat the rules barring new carriers be abolished. Inannouncing yesterday that he had approved the CAA proposals,Mr. Rifkind said, &quot;Needless intervention through rules andregulations harms the industry and harms the interests ofpassengers.&quot;   If the rules hadn't been dropped, United and Americanwouldn't have been permitted to serve Heathrow even if thebilateral treaty were fixed to their liking. TransportationSecretary Skinner, in a statement, called the British move&quot;good news,&quot; while United Chairman Stephen Wolf called it &quot;animportant step.&quot;   Abolishing the ban on new entrants at Heathrow will be abig boost for Virgin Atlantic Airways, a British carrier thathas been eager to fly into the airport. Currently, BritishAirways PLC is the only British airline to serve the airport.   Negotiators on the U.S.-British aviation treaty are underpressure to reach agreement quickly because of Pan Am's direcondition. The carrier, which is operating under Chapter 11bankruptcy-court protection, faces a Friday deadline forpaying back half of a $150 million loan made earlier thisyear by Bankers Trust New York Corp. Pan Am officials havewanted to use proceeds from the sale of the London routes torepay the loan.   United has agreed to buy Pan Am's London routes for $290million, while American has agreed to pay $445 million forthe TWA routes.   ---   Asra Q. Nomani contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
