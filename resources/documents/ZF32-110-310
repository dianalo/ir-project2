(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Shaw, Michael; Bunning, Tim; Threlfall, MJB.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>UP AND RUNNINGandM;I'm writing with reference to your article in news, issue 160, regardingNetwork Sciences Corporation's involvement in starting a Dell User Group.andM;The article states that the group is already floundering and that our onlymotive for getting the group together is publicity and profit.andP;  Nothing couldbe further from the truth.andM;The idea of setting up a user group came from one of our local customers.andP;  Asother major suppliers of PCs have an operatinal user gorup, it seemedsensible to offer like-minded Dell users the same facility.andP;  It's true thatDell hasn't allowed us to mail out to its customer base, but I think that intime, the company will participate fully.andM;I'm particularly upset at the suggestion that we're not interested in runningthe user gorup and all we want is the publicity.andP;  If the members wish us totake an active role in the group, we'd be delighted to do so, withoutpersonally charging for our services.andP;  Hwoever, if the elected officersdecide that any charges need to be levied, it'll be a democratic decision.andM;We have a perfectly good VAR agreement with Dell and would like to workcloser with them on this, as well as other projects.andM;We feel that we can contribute considerably, as we're a professional andexperienced supplier of network products with special skills in hostcommunications, especially IBM minicomputers and mainframes.andM;Michael Shaw Network Sciences Corporation HoveandM;PC User replies: We welcome the formation of any independent user group andaim to cultivate close ties with groups throughout the industry.andM;The news story in question was accurately based on interviews conducted withTim Howlett of NSC and Andy Kerslake of Dell.andP;  We feel confident that wehaven't misrepresented any statement made to us.andM;MINORITY CASEandM;Your news pages in issue 158 included a piece describing the little-knownmaintenance release of Windows 3.0, Windows 3.00a.andM;Our experience tells us that most users are happily running Windows 3.0 andthe release will do nothing to enhance their systems, as it only fixes aminority of problems for a minority of users.andM;Our members were informed about the release in the April issue of our usergroup magazine, Windows User.andP;  Although we'ere the biggest user groupdedicated to Windows outside the US, only registered members can be supporteddirectly.andP;  Mr Johnston isn't a member of the Windows User Group and so wecouldn't have informed him about this release.andP;  I conclude, therefore, thathe must be confusing our professional organisation with another.andM;I was most interested to read your piece (issue 158) discussing therelationship between user groups and their suppliers -- however, I mustcorrect Carol Darby when she refers to the MAUG as the only user grouprecognized by Microsoft.andP;  This is untrue!andP;  The Windows User Group wasestablished and approved by Microsoft before the MAUG, and Microsoft has alsorecently endorsed the newly formed Windows Development Association.andP;  Thesethree cover the entire spectrum of Windows issues for Microsoft users, withthe WUG and WDA covering third-party Windows products, too.andM;As the official Microsoft endorsed Windows User Group, we'll continue to keepour members informed of development as they happen.andM;Tim Bunning Windows User GroupandM;PC User replies:  The news story was based on a number of interviews withusers who had received little or no information about 3.00a.andM;We're pleased to know that your group had, in fact, been informed of the fixand hope that you'll share your information with us in the future.andM;We tend to take the view that an upgrade, however minor, has its place insolving even the smallest of problems.andM;COMMUNITY CAREandM;I'm writing to say how much I look forward to PC User each fortnight and tothank you for the support you've unknowingly given me in the past few months.andM;In February, I thought that I had a Board meeting but 12 minutes later foundmyself unemployed -- quite a shock after 15 years at the helm!andM;Some months later I find myself employed in technical consultancy, and thebacking given by PC User in my darkest hours has been invaluable.andM;MJB Threlfall Hampshire</TEXT></DOC>
