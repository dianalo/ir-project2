He has alsodeveloped a &quot;product strength&quot; chart that positions products available today.andO;(See diagram.)andM;Schulman would agree with White that message suppression or consolemanagement is a good starting point.andM;Automated console management involves programmed processes that monitor theongoing operation of the computer systems, the ability to analyze errorsituations and the ability to respond intelligently to messages from systemsand programs.andP;  Intelligent response is the context in which we imagine trueunattended operations for remote or local data centers: &quot;lights out&quot;operations.andM;These automated capabilities are very attractive for management, not onlybecause they may help control the proportion of the DP budget dedicated topersonnel, but because they can be used to ensure and define standards ofquality.andM;Tony Leonardo, chairman of the Automated Operations Task Force of Share, anIBM mainframe users' group, says a major goal of automated operations is toprovide elasticity between the volume of work (growth) and the resourcerequired to accomplish it.andP;  &quot;In other words, [we want to be] able to sustaingrowth without adding people to the process, or to consolidate work andeliminate people from the process.andP;  Another factor to consider is eliminatingthe need for proximity to the components being acted upon, or remoteoperations.&quot;andM;Sometimes the need goes deeper than workload consolidation or growthmanagement: an organization may wish to locate a data center in some remotearea where traditional staffing is not feasible or practical.andP;  For suchsituations, remote unattended operations may be the only alternatives.andM;Obviously, automated operations can apply to a great deal more than consolemanagement.andP;  In fact, identifying nearly any process required to manage ordeal with a data center operation, and a accomplishing that process via someautomation mechanism, can be considered automated operations.andM;CHANGING HUMAN-WORKLOAD RATIOandM;The most obvious promise of automated operations is to change thehuman-to-workload ratio; to do more without a corresponding growth in staff,or to conserve staff while maintaining the same service.andP;  In extreme cases,such as in remote unattended data centers, it may be possible to eliminatestaff, or at least locate staff at some central place via remote managementtools.andM;However, there are other promises, real or imagined.andP;  Because the operationsstaff monitors message streams to see of something is wrong, data processingbelieves automated operations will free the staff to do other things.andP;  If theoperator could be notified when something happens, instead of constantlywatching messages, then the operator could carry out assignments and work onprojects while on duty.andM;Of course, the operators must be aware that new rules are in effect when themessages slow down.andM;Radi Shourbaji, senior systems programmer for L.M.andP;  Berry and Co., Dayton,Ohio, received a call at home from one of his operators, who said somethingwas wrong because the usual stream of messages was not coming through.andP;  Berryhad recently installed Auto Operator from Boole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif.andO;&quot;I told him to read the memo,&quot; Shourbaji said.andM;Underlying all automation efforts is the awareness that human involvementexposes us to human errors.andP;  Where a company can automate, it can eliminateor reduce such human errors.andP;  So automated operations point the way towardhigher availability and better service delivery.andM;These are worthy goals that have been adopted by many organizations.andM;Many data centers, as they grow, have discovered that their existingprocesses are inadequate for their expanded horizons, and embark upon someform of automated operations projects, even if they do not call it that.andO;Sometimes these projects are very successful, especially in the well-definedand well-understood areas such as tape management and system monitoring.andM;In other cases, particularly where the scope of the project is larger,successes are fewer and failures or partial successes prevail.andM;The biggest problems that firms face in implementing automated operationsprojects stem from: lack of education and understanding; lack of managementcommitment; and lack of involvement at all levels in the organization,according to Arnold Farber, a partner in Farber/La Chance, Inc., Richmond,Va.andO;The consulting firm specializes in automated operations.andM;RE-EVALUATINGandM;Farber says, &quot;In order to achieve success with automated operations you haveto change how people think, from manual methods to automated ones.andP;  Theprocesses you have built must be re-evaluated.andP;  Many must be eliminated andnew processes built.&quot;andM;He believes an organization should begin with education and involvement, evenbefore the automated operations project is well-defined.andM;&quot;Frequently, the operators won't support the project because they believe itwill eliminate their jobs.andP;  People don't understand, and managementcommitment to resources, time and staff involvement is often lacking,&quot; Farbersaid.andP;  &quot;The day to day pproduction needs of the organization can easilyovertake the project.andP;  But when you come to work in the morning, and when youleave in the evening, the daily work and problems will still be there, andthe only wat to make things better is to change how you do them.&quot;andM;He goes on to point out the importance of involvement and ownership by theoperations staff in an automated operations project.andP;  If operations is notinvolved, they will tend to see automation as something &quot;done to them&quot;--as athreat.andP;  And the operators are in the best possible position to sidetract, oreven derail, the project.andM;In one instance, the technical support staff in a large data center undertooka massive project to eliminate &quot;necessary&quot; console messages.andP;  After extensivereview and interviews with the operations staff, they were able to identify80% of the console messages as unnecessary.andP;  They then implemented theappropriate message filtering, along with a memo telling the operations staffwhat they had done.andM;The results were exactly the opposite of what they expected.andP;  Instead ofbeing more comfortable with operating the console, because they were morelikely notice important messages, the operators resented the cavalierapproach that changed their environment.andM;As in many centers, the operators unconsciously used the &quot;pace&quot; of consolemessages as a sort of heartbeat to tell them that the systems were performingnormally.andP;  In a very short time, the operations staff had re-instituted allbut 14 repetitious messages, and the situation was &quot;back to normal.&quot;andP;  Thetechnical support staff probably still does not understand what went wrong.andO;Shourbaji of L.M.andP;  Berry could perhaps understand.andM;GOALS MUST BE IDENTIFIEDandM;If education, involvement and commitment are fundamental keys to success,another key for data processing managers is to identify the payback ofautomation.andM;White of R.J.andP;  Reynolds said, &quot;Right now, there is tremendous peer pressurein the DP community to have the neatest automation tool on the market.andP;  Toomany people are trying to solve problems they have not identified.&quot;andM;No one is going to undertake a massive project like automated operations forthe fun of it, or for the good of their collective souls.andP;  What theorganization undertakes should be dictated by where it hurts.andP;  If yourorganization's problem is managing production job streams, automating theCICS failure-restart process may be entertaining but does not do much for thebottom line.andM;It is essential to examine any automated operations project in the same termsas any other project.andP;  What problem are we trying to solve?andP;  What does notsolving it cost us?andP;  What will the solution cost us?andP;  Is it worth doing?andM;Only when these questions have been carefully examined can the bottom line beidentified, and only then can management realistically make a commitment.andO;Otherwise, the peril is that management may be sold on the notion ofautomated operations with overly-optimistic goals and miscalculated costs.andM;As a result, commitment may be withdrawn, or at best be tepid, and theproject may stall as resources are continually applied to other, more&quot;important&quot; projects.andM;RECOGNIZING PITFALLSandM;Steve Doubleday, MVS systems supervisor at Kaiser Health Plan of SouthernCalifornia in Pasadena, discovered many of these pitfalls.andP;  Kaiser hadalready implemented some level of automation using publicly available tools,such as TSSO from the IBM users' group Share, to achieve rapidshutdown/restart of its online CICS systems.andM;Kaiser perceived automation as essential to achieving increased availability.andO;In addition, one prospect for dealing with continuing growth called for oneor more remote data centers.andM;The technical support staff developed a plan for widespread automatedoperations of virtually every aspect of console and exception management,intended as a base to allow them to remotely operate future distributed datacenters in an unattended fashion.andM;Doubleday and his associates developed a requirements list for an automationtool to accomplish these goals, reviewed the available products, and finallyselected OPS/MVS from MVS Systems, Inc. of Houston.andP;  It offered all thefacilities they felt needed, and more.andM;The package was acquired and meeets the company's needs, yet little has beendone with the package a year later.andP;  What happened?andM;&quot;We acquired a new data center manager.andP;  His priorities were elsewherebecause his attention was on more immediate problems.andP;  He was also skepticalof our grand design and overall approach to automation,&quot; Doubleday said.andM;&quot;The primary support person was reassigned to another project, which is notyet completed.andP;  We still don't know if we are going to implement a seconddata center, so both the timing and the necessity are uncertain.andP;  Weunderestimated the magnitude of the tasks involved in really implementingwidespread automation,&quot; he continued.andM;&quot;Also, while the advantages of automation are hard to quantify, it is veryeasy to see mistakes due to automation.andP;  For each 10 bull's-eyes, you missone--and that's what shows.andP;  It always looks like you're losing ground.&quot;andM;Doubleday said that what they do with automation depends upon theorganization commitment and upon the ultimate direction.andP;  When asked ifacquiring OPS/MVS was the right decision, he said, &quot;Is one dissatisfied witha Cadillac?&quot;andM;But he admitted that until his company is better-organized to exploitautomation, the power of OPS/MVS over a less capable tool will not really beexploited.andM;White of R.J.andP;  Reynolds echoed the observation.andP;  &quot;Software vendors aretelling people they're not in the ballgame without a product.andP;  But if theorganiztion is not ready, the product may be solving absolutely nothing,&quot; hesaid.andM;Vaporware is also an issue; some vendors are selling based on what they planto have instead of what they offer today, White said.andM;UNDERSTAND VARIOUS FUNCTIONSandM;Each automated operations package offers a set of tools to address theproblem it was developed to solve, whether the problem be tape management orconsole operations.andP;  Tape management systems provide a set of functions andfacilities to automate the management of tape usage.andP;  Job scheduling packagesdefine, schedule, submit, track and manage production jobs.andP;  System monitorswatch system operations and raise exception flags when problems occur.andM;In all of these cases, the set of activities--the operations process beingautomated--is understood, and the relationship of the functions of theproblem being solved is apparent.andM;However, as we move toward full-function automated operations, a subtledistinction comes into play.andP;  In effect, having the tools does not by itselfsolve the problem.andM;The major full-function automated operations packages provide a rich andfairly consistent set of facilities.andP;  But in trying to employ thesefacilities, problems arise such as the interpaly of separately developedpieces of automation.andP;  Such problems have been documented in the literature,but the bottom line is that most data processing managers do not understandthe processes they are trying to automate.andM;Instead of understanding the overall process, A DP manager may see a set ofdisparate activities and consequently attempt to address them separately.andO;The result is that the individual pieces of automation, each functional byitself, may interact incorrectly--and occasionally disastrously.andP;  This is notsimply a limitation in the capabilities of the automation tool, but a problemwith the state of the art.andM;Until someone, vendor or public benefactor, can define and provide a templateroad map defining the overall process and the ways the pieces fit togetherand interact, this will remain one of the biggest problems in achieving&quot;total&quot; automation.andM;Examining the number of potential communication paths between even a fewentities suggests what will happen as the number of separate pieces ofautomation (CLists, directives, etc.) goes up.andP;  It will rapidly pass anyone'sability to understand what will actually happen under some sets ofcircumstances.andM;Ironically, it is just this set of circumstances that often leads to thepursuit of automation.andP;  That was true at R.J.andP;  Reynolds in Winston-Salem,wheret he data center grew so rapidly from 1981 to 1989 that: CICS regionsincreased from three in 1981 to 33; and batch jobs per day grew from 800 to18,000.andP;  &quot;The environment grew beyond a human's capacity to know what wasgoing on anymore,&quot; said White.andM;Trying to grasp and plan for this is what explodes the size of majorautomation projects, and what has defeated some of the most ambitiousundertakings.andP;  This does not mean individuals should avoid automationprojects, but one should be cautious.andM;PLANNING FOR SUCCESSandM;Automated operations should be an ongoing project within an organization,with a standing group assigned to identify, recommend and pursue areas andprocesses where there can be a real return on the automation investment.andM;No one can ensure success, but the following guidelines are essential:andM;Carefully Define Your Goals.andP;  Do not solve it if it is not a problem.andP;  Definethe costs of not solving it, and the costs of solving it.andP;  Be sure there is avalid, bottom-line business case, and that you can achieve the results youpromise.andM;Allow Processes To Change.andP;  Do not build a &quot;horseless carriage.&quot; Someproblems should not be solved--the rules should be changed.andP;  For example,this might mean changing application systems to not issue WTORs rather thantrying to automate each response to the WTOR.andM;Education, Commitment, Involvement.andP;  Make sure the people who own the processown the project.andP;  This does not mean they have to change the systems, butthey must be fully involved in the redefinition of what is, after all, theirjob.andP;  Make sure management is committed by providing clear goals,cost/benefit justifications and resource estimates.andM;Show Your Successes.andP;  Take small steps everyone can see, and announce anddemonstrate the results.andP;  Build confidence in the project as it moves ahead.andO;Beware of biting off more than you can chew.andP;  &quot;If the first step is bigenough, some people will never take it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
