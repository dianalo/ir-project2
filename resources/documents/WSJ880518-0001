Mr. Lawson surprised markets yesterday by prompting banks to lower by one-half percentage point -- to the lowest level in a decade -- the reference rate on which they base all other lending rates. The interest-rate decrease, effective today, followed sterling's sharp rise on Monday despite two previous one-half-point cuts in base rates since March.    Yesterday's interest-rate reduction also signaled an easing, at least for the time being, of the much-publicized split between Mr. Lawson and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over exchange-rate policy. Their disagreement has heated up in the past week amid suggestions in British newspapers -- denied by Thatcher aides -- of imminent ministerial resignations. But after yesterday's interest-rate cut, Mrs. Thatcher voiced broad support for her chancellor in the House of Commons.    Many analysts considered the base-rate reduction a victory for Mr. Lawson's views that sterling should be kept within a narrow band against the mark. Mrs. Thatcher, who favors a more free-market approach, brought their disagreement into the open in March, ordering an end to massive currency intervention aimed at holding sterling below three marks. By the end of that month, the pound had surged above 3.12 marks.    The chancellor has said he wants to contain the pound's rise because it endangers Britain's export industry. The British currency, however, showed some resilience in foreign-exchange trading yesterday. It fell to 3.1625 marks in London, from 3.1900 marks Monday, after the interest-rate cut announcement, but recovered somewhat to stand at 3.1755 marks in late New York trading. It was weaker against the dollar, falling to $1.8625 in London, from $1.8920 Monday, after the announcement and declining further to $1.8608 late in New York. The dollar was helped by the announcement of a narrower-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in March.    The Bank of England signaled the interest-rate fall late yesterday by lowering one of its key money-market intervention rates. National Westminster Bank PLC quickly announced its base-rate reduction. Other leading banks soon followed.    Nevertheless, many economists expect the pound to resume climbing toward 3.20. &quot;It isn't clear that this half-point reduction will do anything to quell&quot; sterling's rise, said Peter Warburton, an economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London. &quot;There is no reason why there couldn't be another base-rate cut&quot; sometime soon, he added.    Indeed, many London economists say that though interest rates may decline in the short term, they probably will then rise by one-half percentage point or a full point within three to six months. &quot;At some point, the rather fantastic expansion of credit has got to receive some attention,&quot; Mr. Warburton said.    In the House of Commons yesterday, Mrs. Thatcher said she and Mr. Lawson &quot;entirely agree that we must maintain a firm monetary policy and a downwards pull on inflation.&quot; Britain's three recent interest-rate cuts were &quot;clearly intended to affect the exchange rate,&quot; she added.    After her parliamentary appearance, Tory members who have voiced disquiet over her handling of the exchange-rate issue said they were satisfied with her statements. But a spokeswoman for Labor leader Neil Kinnock said that &quot;the row has probably just been painted over. Until the government decides its long-term policy&quot; on exchange rates, the spokeswoman added, &quot;these problems will continue.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
