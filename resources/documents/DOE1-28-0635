<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0635 </DOCNO><TEXT>Much of the previous research in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis has beendirected toward development of catalysts having higher selectivitiesto premium hydrocarbon products such as light olefins or gasoline. Nevertheless,the product distribution of conventional, non-shape-selective FT catalystsis governed by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) polymerization kinetics whichplace severe restrictions on the maximum yield of any given product orproduct range, e.g., a maximum of 47 wt%. C{sub 5}-C{sub 11} gasolinerange hydrocarbons. Attempts to circumvent the limitations of ASF kineticsthrough incorporation of catalyst additives, strong metal-support interactions,and supported metal clusters have generally met with little success,although these catalyst modifications can be used to tailor catalystselectivities for branched paraffins, olefins, and alcohols within theconstraints of the ASF model. This study was undertaken to determinethe effects of potassium level and calcination pretreatment on the activityand selectivity properties of potassium-promoted Fe/SiO{sub 2}. The resultsreveal that a mild calcination treatment can dramatically influence theactivity/selectivity behavior of Fe/K/SiO{sub 2} catalysts, and theyprovide evidence of an alternative synthesis route in CO hydrogenationon these catalysts. 28 references.</TEXT></DOC>
