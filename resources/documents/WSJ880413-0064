Traders said that portfolio managers who specialize in small stocks are accelerating their buying of selected small and midsize issues. These stocks have less impact on the weighted Nasdaq averages than the heavily traded institutional giants such as MCI Communications, which was unchanged at 12 3/4.    As a result, the Nasdaq industrial index rose 1.11 points to 394.56. That's a 0.28% increase, smaller than yesterday's 0.68% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The biggest OTC issues lagged behind the Dow Jones average even more, with the Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrials rising just 0.32 to 360.20.    Because the heaviest buying was among midsize issues that accounted for most of the day's big gainers, some 42.9 million shares rose in price on Nasdaq's National Market System, while a little more than half that many, or 24.7 million, slipped.    Because individual buyers currently account for little of the Nasdaq buying, the small Nasdaq issues that trade off the National Market System were flat yesterday. Some 4.5 million non-NMS shares rose in price and a like number fell.    In all, some 87.7 million shares traded on the National Market System yesterday, while a moderate volume of 123.4 million shares traded on the total Nasdaq system.    Traders say the small-stock specialists who are buying most heavily now are the same professionals who loaded up on crash-depressed OTC issues in December before the January price boom in OTC stocks. This time they are apparently taking advantage of the late March sell-off to buy up selected OTC issues that haven't rebounded sharply from last year's market collapse.    They are buying most heavily in stock groups that have risen this year, but are picking issues in these groups that haven't made big price moves despite solid earnings and revenue.    Yesterday, purchases were concentrated among issues with market values of $25 million to $125 million, and in such groups as metal fasteners and fabricators, basic machinery, auto parts, medical equipment makers and certain retailers.    Among midsize makers of metal hardware yesterday, Fastenal, a $50 million market-value issue, climbed 2 1/4 to 18 1/4. The company makes bolts and other fasteners. Among similar-size issues, RSI Corp., which makes office and outdoor equipment, rose 1 to 10. Barden, a basic machinery maker, climbed 3 1/2 to 40 1/2.    Barden, like many of the basic metal and machinery issues in the $50 million market-value range, is a lightly traded issue with a big spread between the asked price, at which investors buy the stock, and the bid, or price at which they can sell it. Yesterday, however, both bid and asked prices rose, as well as the quoted price, which reflects the last trade. The bid climbed 1 to 38 a share.    Investors bought some stocks yesterday because of big earnings upturns. Stewart andamp; Stevenson Services, a $120 million market-value retailer, climbed 1 1/2 to 26 on its announcement of a rise in net for the fourth quarter to $1.72 a share from 72 cents a year earlier.    But a number of specialty retailers climbed yesterday without earnings news. Designs Inc., an issue that was hard hit in last October's crash, climbed 1 to 6 3/4. The company operates stores that sell primarily Levi Strauss clothing to young, affluent buyers. Retailers catering to this group were generally hardest hit last October among the OTC retail issues.    Similarly, Spectramed, a medical equipment concern, climbed 3/4 to 4 3/8 on news of an earnings turnaround yesterday. But among medical equipment issues with no earnings news yesterday, Genicom rose 3/4 to 9 1/2, and K Tron International climbed 1 1/4 to 13 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
