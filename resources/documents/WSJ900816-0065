As part of its plans to buy Ford Aerospace Corp. for $715million and the assumption of certain obligations, Loralagreed to let Ford keep about $100 million from FordAerospace's overfunded pension fund, said persons familiarwith the transaction. The fund currently has about $300million more than it apparently needs to meet itsobligations, these persons say.</LP><TEXT>   But Defense Department officials said they may have aclaim to some assets in the Ford Aerospace pension funds,because the money put into the funds was paid to Ford incompensation for defense contracts. Thus, the officials said,the $100 million in excess assets might have to be returnedto the government, and might not legitimately belong to theauto maker.   &quot;The Department of Defense has placed a good chunk ofthose funds in there,&quot; said Derek Vander Schaff, deputyinspector general for the Defense Department. &quot;The questionis are these companies allowed to do this with money thegovernment hasn't taken back out.&quot;   Mr. Vander Schaff said the inquiry began last week and isnow in &quot;very preliminary stages&quot; with government auditorsreviewing the transaction.   Ford officials confirmed the auto maker is getting somemoney out of the overfunded pension as part of the pendingtransaction with Loral. &quot;We aren't transferring all of the{pension} surplus to Loral,&quot; said Ford spokesman ThomasRhoades. &quot;But we are transferring more than enough to coverall of Ford Aerospace's employees.&quot; Ford officials declinedto specify how much the company is getting from the pensionfund, which has a total of about $1 billion in assets.   In an interview, Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz said theNew York-based defense electronics concern hasn't beencontacted by the Pentagon about the pension fund, but he saidhe isn't concerned that it's being scrutinized. &quot;That's theirjob,&quot; he said. Mr. Schwartz also declined to specify how muchFord would extract before transferring assets to Loral.   The important thing, he stressed, is that Loral is set toreceive enough to meet all pension-fund obligations forcurrent Ford Aerospace employees as well as retirees, plusanother 50% or so. &quot;From Loral's point of view, there is noissue here,&quot; the chairman said. &quot;The employees are fullycovered. Besides the pension fund, the surplus and Loral'sown balance sheet, there are also government guarantees.&quot; Helikened the situation to having both &quot;a belt and suspenderson.&quot;   Despite all the assurances that Ford Aerospace employeebenefits will be left intact, the ruckus over the pensionfund has made some workers nervous. &quot;People are veryworried,&quot; said one top Ford Aerospace official. &quot;There is ageneral distrust here since we've been sold, and thosefeelings are being aimed at Ford -- not Loral.   &quot;It's a complicated subject, and people aren't going to besatisfied with a few words,&quot; he added. &quot;They want details.&quot;   Because Ford had anticipated potential Pentagon concernswith the use of pension money, Loral agreed to indemnify thecar company against government action. &quot;We assessed the riskof that happening,&quot; Mr. Schwartz said. &quot;Ford asked forindemnification, and we determined it was not an excessiverisk.&quot; In other words, Loral essentially will assume anypossible liability stemming from a government attempt to getthe money back. Any such effort would likely take severalyears to resolve, persons close to the deal said.   The government's claim to the pension funds involves theamount it allows defense companies, such as Ford Aerospace,for overhead costs in bidding for contracts. But if thepension costs paid by the Defense Department are lower thanexpected, the government often seeks to have some of thefunds returned.   &quot;Pension funds are either underfunded or overfunded at anypoint in time,&quot; Mr. Vander Schaff said. &quot;There's never a timewhen things match up exactly.&quot;   Federal pension laws now forbid companies from takingassets from existing pension funds. But companies havecircumvented that by terminating pension plans andre-establishing them under a different name. With FordAerospace, there are also questions about how much money thegovernment could lay claim to, given that the Newport Beach,Calif., unit derives a good portion of its profits from thecommercial satellite market.   Moreover, Mr. Schwartz said he understands that for years,Ford hasn't added to the pension fund any money connectedwith military contracts. &quot;I just don't know on what basis thegovernment can make a claim,&quot; he said. &quot;And until they do,I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.&quot;   The use of overfunded pensions to help finance corporateacquisitions has become a source of concern in Congress,which has held several hearings on ways to limit suchtransfers.</TEXT></DOC>
