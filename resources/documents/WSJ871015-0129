As adults swarm around her she stands there mute; her mother has just been killed.    Other children, accustomed to regarding the rubble their neighborhood had become as a playground, approach her cautiously. They ask her if it's true her mother was killed; would she like to play? A little boy offers her some shrapnel he's picked up nearby. They don't really understand why she seems so upset -- or maybe they do. But they, the children, have chosen to treat the war as a surreal comedy, a game.    John Boorman's new film, &quot;Hope and Glory,&quot; is filled with moments like these, moments that distill the horror and the absurdity of war through a child's sensibility. The child, called Billy (Sebastian Rice Edwards), is based on Mr. Boorman's recollection of himself at age seven, living through the bombings.    His memory of that time has a dreamlike quality, as he conjures up the adventures the war brought to his placid neighborhood. He shows us how he and his chums set up their club headquarters in a bombed-out house, and were as vicious and bombastic in their way as the adults were being in theirs. These boys loved the wreckage around them. The war turned whole neighborhoods into the equivalent of a small-boy's room; a landscape where order has been blown apart.    Though Billy suffered nightmares that in ways were no more surrealistic than his waking hours, death doesn't trip up his vision of war as a glorious adventure. When his mother drags him out of a war movie during an air raid he begs: &quot;Can't we see the end?&quot; When she points out that a real war is going on outside he sulks: &quot;It's not the same.&quot;    When he keeps his focus on the children erupting in exhilarated cheers when their school is bombed, Mr. Boorman sustains a mood of giddy poignancy. The children aren't worried about the big picture, what the consequences of this war might be. All they know is that it's disrupted their common enemy: order.    Though this is unusually earthbound subject matter for Mr. Boorman, he maintains the visual lyricism of his earlier movies like &quot;The Emerald Forest,&quot; &quot;Excalibur,&quot; &quot;Zardoz.&quot; He has a great eye for the magical moment in which events float free of ordinary reality, when chaos becomes mundane.    There is a stunning comic beauty in the scene where a German parachutist is forced to land in Billy's neighborhood. The neighbors stand back and gawk at this young man plopped down in a cabbage patch, one of the last remnants of tidiness. They draw back in fear as he reaches into his pocket, only to pull out a cigarette. The soldier, who seems to appreciate the irony of all this, raises his hands in surrender to the elderly, unarmed bobby who stumbles through the cabbages to get his man. They walk away and the women storm the field; they can't wait to get at that silk parachute.    When Mr. Boorman turns his lens on the adults, a certain preciousness takes over. He seems to want to singlehandedly reverse the recent trend in movies that show the seedy side of British life. Here upper lips are kept stiff; nostalgia rules the day. But this is a movie of moments, and the moments are very nice indeed.    ---   David Mamet, the playwright and screenwriter, has directed his first movie, the maddening and fascinating &quot;House of Games.&quot;    Mr. Mamet, a poker fiend, has long been obsessed with the notion of life as the big bluff. His con men aren't much different from other people, just more explicit about the scams they pull. For example, Mike, who snookers people for a living, scoffs at a woman who accuses him of betraying her: &quot;Of course you gave me your trust,&quot; he sneers. &quot;That's what I do for a living.&quot;    Mr. Mamet has staged his film as a '40s &quot;film noir&quot; -- sort of. He's had camera man Juan Ruiz Anchia shoot the picture with deliberate artifice to match the deliberate artifice of Mr. Mamet's language.    When Mike sneaks into someone else's hotel room to make love to a woman, and she is worried that the room's owner will return too soon, Mike tells her: &quot;I don't think so. And if he does, we'll deal with that thing then.&quot; Listen to that: &quot;We'll deal with that thing then.&quot;    The picture is billed as a psychological thriller but it plays more like a weird comedy. Mr. Mamet keeps flipping the plot around to see how many cons he can cook up in a couple of hours. You start catching onto the game pretty quickly, but it's still fun to watch exactly how the scam will unroll.    He pits Margaret Ford, a repressed celebrity psychiatrist, against the con men. Lindsay Crouse, Mr. Mamet's wife, plays Dr. Ford, who feels compelled to mix it up with some professional sleazes so her &quot;real-life&quot; experience will make her a better shrink. The action centers on the denizens of the House of Games, a low-rent gaming parlor glaring neon-bright from the middle of some street, somewhere.    Ms. Crouse, her hair and voice clipped, looks ready to implode, she's so restrained inside her severe suit. She walks her Dr. Ford through the picture in a daze, as though she's mesmerized by the cadence of the words her husband has put in her mouth. It's an odd, off-putting performance that isn't helped by the picture's conclusion.    The con men, led by Joe Mantegna, however, are superb as they slink their way through Mr. Mamet's sly shenanigans. </TEXT></DOC>
