A group that is challenging the incumbent board said it will seek a court order reversing the postponement and requiring that shareholder votes received by yesterday morning be counted and considered as binding.    HBO's board took the action Wednesday night, citing its creation last week of a special directors' committee to study &quot;financial alternatives,&quot; including the possible sale of the company, sale of certain assets, a stock buyback and a recapitalization.    According to HBO, &quot;numerous stockholders&quot; suggested the postponement until after the committee makes its recommendations. The board said in a statement that it intends to act &quot;promptly&quot; to take steps that will &quot;maximize shareholder value.&quot;    The company, a hospital computer-equipment concern, has been under pressure since last year, when its earnings sagged and its founder and chairman, Walter S. Huff, had to return as chief executive. Last May, the company proposed and then later withdrew a recapitalization plan. Last September, Andover Group -- headed by two former executives of another hospital computer concern -- made a $330 million proposal to buy HBO. The bid was rebuffed.    But Andover Group, a Virginia-based investment partnership, has continued to maintain about a 7% stake in HBO and its principals formed the Committee for Full Value of HBO andamp; Co. to run a six-member director slate. Andover Group principals Ronald V. Aprahamian and Ronald L. Holden said in a statement, &quot;We believe that after an exhaustive proxy contest, at the last possible minute, the board is attempting to deny stockholders the opportunity to elect a new slate of directors. . . .&quot;    They said they will seek in the court order to have the winning directors declared elected at a reconvened meeting &quot;to be held at the earliest possible date.&quot; Under the terms of HBO's postponement, the record date for shareholders entitled to vote would be reset to Aug. 3.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, HBO shares closed at $12, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
