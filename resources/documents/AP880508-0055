SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donald T. Regan, former White House chief ofstaff, on Sunday portrayed President Reagan as a hesitant andunassertive chief executive controlled by a scheming,image-conscious first lady who depended heavily upon anastrologer's stargazing predictions.   Regan offered a sometimes bitter account of his stormy days atthe White House in a memoir, ``For the Record: From Wall Street toWashington,'' published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and scheduledto go on sale in bookstores on Monday.   ``Virtually ever major move and decision the Reagans made duringmy time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance with awoman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain thatthe planets were in a favorable alignments for the enterprise,''Regan wrote.   He did not identify the woman, saying Nancy Reagan referred toher only as ``Friend.'' But Time magazine, which carried excerptsof the book in its new issue, said, ``She is Nob Hill SocialiteJoan Quigley, sixtyish, a Vassar graduate who has written threebooks on astrology.''   Ms. Quigley, a wealthy Republican whose specialty is politics,is a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin show. She has beenpracticing astrology since the 1960s and has written several bookson the subject.   Reached by the San Francisco Chronicle last week on vacation inParis, she acknowledged she has known the Reagans for years, butrefused to comment on whether they had ever been her clients.   ``I never say who my clients are. Never. It is veryconfidential,'' she said.   Asked if it would be wrong to say she was the Reagans'astrologer, she said: ``I won't comment on that. I can't comment.''   The Reagans had no comment Sunday afternoon when they alightedfrom the helicopter that brought them from Camp David, Md., wherethey had spent the weekend. Reagan pointed to his ear, indicatinghe could not hear questions shouted at him by reporters; Mrs.Reagan appeared cool and unsmiling, but said nothing.   On Friday, however, Reagan expressed irritation about Regan'sbook, the latest in a series of ``kiss and tell'' books aboutReagan's presidency. ``He's chosen to attack my wife and I don'tlook kindly upon that at all,'' Reagan said.   For a time, Regan says he was kept in the dark about Mrs.Reagan's secret, closely held by a handful of aides since Reagan'sdays as the governor of California.   But after repeated clashes with the first lady over schedules,longtime Reagan aide Michael Deaver told the chief of staff aboutthe woman and advised Regan to ``humor'' the first lady, he said.   ``At one point, I kept a color-coded calendar on my desk(numerals highlighted in green ink for `good' days, red for `bad'days, yellow for `iffy' days) as an aid to remembering when it waspropitious to move the president of the United States from oneplace to another, or schedule him to speak in public, or commencenegotiations with a foreign power,'' Regan wrote.   Mrs. Reagan liked to chat with the woman every Saturday fromCamp David, he said. The advice from the soothsayer, coupled with aconcern by Nancy Reagan for the president's health that Regandescribed as ``excessive,'' caused particular problems when theIran-Contra scandal broke and prostate surgery required a time ofrecuperation, the former chief of staff recalled.   Regan described Mrs. Reagan as presiding over ``a shadowydistaff presidency'' and using ``adroit guerrilla actions'' toachieve goals in ``a genuine belief that she was the best judge ofher husband's interests.''   ``Mrs. Reagan regarded herself as the president's alter ego notonly in the conjugal but also in the political and officialdimensions, as if the office that had been bestowed upon herhusband by the people somehow fell into the category of worldlygoods covered by the marriage vows,'' he wrote.   ``The president's view of the situation was never discussed,''he said. ``The fact that he permitted it to exist, and that henever reversed any of the situations created by his wife'sintervention, was regarded as sufficient evidence that he waswilling to tolerate the state of affairs.''   Regan pressed the first lady to allow the president to speak outon the Iran-Contra affair, telling her, ``We need a pressconference, public appearances, speeches.''   ``A full month after the president's release from the hospital,his schedule was still a dead letter because Mrs. Reagan's `Friend'had not provided a list of auspicious days. The whole monthappeared inauspicious for the president,'' Regan wrote.   After consulting with her ``Friend,'' the first lady providedsome possible dates, Regan wrote. But her advice was not alwaysheeded. Regan wrote that Mrs. Reagan appeared to want to delay thepresident's July 1985 surgery for suspected cancer of the colonbecause of her astrological concerns, but the president overruledany delay.   Regan quoted the president saying, ``Why wait? Do the test andgo ahead with the operation.''   But Mrs. Reagan's influence hardly stopped at such lessermatters as scheduling trips or speeches, Regan said. In hisaccount, she was the one who decreed that Vice President GeorgeBush and national security adviser Robert McFarlane be barred fromReagan's hospital bed for days following his cancer surgery.   And the president's longtime friendship with CIA DirectorWilliam J. Casey did not prevent the first lady from pressing forhis ouster, even as he lay recuperating from brain cancer surgeryat Christmastime 1986, Regan contended in one of his manydescriptions of their telephone conversations.   ``Mrs. Reagan, who had already shown signs of irritability, nowbecame angry. ... `You're more interested in protecting Bill Caseythan in protecting Ronnie!' she cried. `He's got to go. He can't dohis job; he's an embarrassment to Ronnie. He should be out,'''Regan quoted the first lady as insisting.   And, Reagan asserted, the first lady not only chose the speechwriter for such vital addresses as the State of the Union, but alsoheavily edited them.   ``I don't give a damn about the right-to-lifers,'' he quotesMrs. Reagan as saying when she demanded that passages referring toabortion be deleted.   Regan contended he was ousted by an effort organized at thehands of Mrs. Reagan and several of her close associates, and hebarely has a kind word for the first lady in the 379-page book.   Regan portrayed Reagan as a president who ``laid down no rulesand articulated no mission.'' At the same time, he told ofinstances in which Reagan held lengthy discussions with aides oncomplicated legislation, bills or administration efforts to pushbudget cuts through Capitol Hill.   But Mrs. Reagan emerged in the book as Regan's foremost target.He paints her as an easily irritated ``constant telephonepresence,'' who constantly meddled in administration affairs.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
