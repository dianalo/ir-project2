In theCzechoslovak situation, 400 kV utility distribution plants are envisagedwhose siting should be considered along with the siting of nuclear powerplants. Analyses show that in spite of all environmental impacts of suchlarge nuclear sources, in Czechoslovakia their construction will be apositive contribution, especially in areas where they can replace fossil-fuelsources which, from the environmental point of view, are totally unsatisfactory.Recommendations are put forward for feasibility studies of high outputnuclear power plants focused on the tasks which should be solved as earlyas at this stage with respect to environmental protection.
