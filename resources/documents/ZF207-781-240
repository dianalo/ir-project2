Marlow, director of business development inHarris's Computer Systems Division, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.andP;  &quot;We are providinga systems approach to the secure environment.&quot;andM;The Night Hawk series of real-time super-microcomputers andsuper-minicomputers has processing power ranging from 12 million instructionsper second (MIPS) to 48 MIPS.andM;The Night Hawk had been marketed in the aerospace simulation and trainingmarkets, but Harris officials expect the secure environment will open up themarket for command, control, communications and intelligence (C3I)applications, such as message processing, simulation, signal and imageintelligence, and mission planning, Marlow said.andM;Security MandateandM;Also, civilian agencies are becoming more security conscious because of themandate that requires them to buy C2-level systems starting in 1990, Marlowsaid.andM;The new products are based on Harris' B1-level CX/SX secure UNIX operatingsystem for the Night Hawks, Marlow said.andP;  The LAN/SX secure LAN is availablethrough an agreement between Harris and Verdix Corp. of Chantilly, Va.andP;  The630/SX windowing system is available through an agreement between Harris andATandamp;T Federal Systems.andM;The secure windowing system uses ATandamp;T's 630 Multi-Tasking Graphics secureintelligent terminal, which simultaneously processes different levels ofsecurity on the same terminal, a Harris statement said.andP;  It has a B1-levelcertification.andM;A B3 trusted path is maintained with the CX/SX operating system kernel, and&quot;the terminal can assure communications are with the kernel and not with aTrojan horse or a virus,&quot; a Harris statement said.andM;Users can create up to seven windows connected with the host, and as manylocal windows as the system memory will allow, Marlow said.andM;The windows can operate at different levels of security.andM;The windowing software has an initial purchase price of $2,500, and each630/SX terminal, which includes a monochrome bit-mapped display with 1,024-by 1,024-pixel resolution and 1M of memory, expandable to 2.5M, has a listprice of $5,200.andP;  The 630/SX is available now.andM;Features of the LAN/SX secure LAN include access control, identification,authentication, network auditing and Internet Protocol security optionsupport, a Harris statement said.andM;Levels of ProtectionandM;The Verdix secure LAN Harris integrated into its environment with somemodifications had a B2-level security, Marlow said.andM;LAN/SX offers multilevel security on networks running Ethernet and TCP/IP.andO;&quot;A secured Night Hawk system can serve as a secure network server, ahigh-speed communications gateway or a security administration host for thesecure LAN,&quot; Marlow said.andM;The Network Security Center monitors security levels and activities and asecure interface card plugs into different systems tied to the network,Marlow said.andM;Network security hardware and software has a list price of $24,500.andP;  Eachencryption controller for all systems on the network is $4,500.andP;  LAN/SX willbe available in the third quarter of 1990.andM;Future additions to the secure environment will include message handling anda word processing package, Marlow said.andM;Harris is in final negotiations with Oracle Corp. to integrate Oracleproducts into the secure environment, said James L. Kenny, Harris' directorof C3I.andM;&quot;In the future we will see security in a real-time environment,&quot; Kenny said.andO;&quot;We are heading toward A-level and beyond certification because it isinevitable in the industry.&quot;andM;The security products are being beta tested at two government sites, butMarlow declined to name the agencies.andM;The security products eventually will be placed on the General ServicesAdministration's schedule, but first Harris &quot;must go through the hoops,&quot;because it is difficult to get a new product placed on the schedule, Marlowsaid.andM;Harris can get its products Tempestized for contracts with such arequirement, but &quot;we are seeing fewer Tempest requirements coming out,&quot; Kennysaid.andP;  'The intelligence community is moving away from Tempest.&quot;andM;Contact William J.
