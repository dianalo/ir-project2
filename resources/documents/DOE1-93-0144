With increasing doses of radiation,plasma DAO activity increased on Day 2 and intestinal DAO activity decreasedon Day 4; moreover, the approximate relative biological effectivenessvalues for these changes in activity were 5.81 for plasma DOA activityon Day 2 and 3.88 for intestinal DAO activity on Day 4. On Day 6 relativelyhigh levels of radiation-caused DAO activity in the small intestine toremain depressed whereas low levels resulted in recovery with activitiesat or near controls. In animals with combined injury (radiation plus30% surface burn or wound), changes in DAO activity in the intestinewere similar to those with radiation alone; plasma DAO activity, in contrastto radiation alone, did not show an increase at the 2-day mark. Thesedose-dependent relationships should provide a basis for using DAO asa potential indicator of biological damage from radiation exposure withinthe lethal range.</TEXT></DOC>
