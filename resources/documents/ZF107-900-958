 Theypromise you the world but deliver only Hackensack.andM;Ideally, an online service should function as a seamless extension of yourPC, one that is no more difficult to use than any other peripheral.andP;  But mostPC users find that their first encounter with a network such as CompuServe,MCI, or GEnie is like a trip to the Dark Ages.andP;  Logging on means leavingbehind the modern comforts of graphical interfaces and readily available helpto enter a world of dense, misleading menu trees, vague prompts, andunforgiving command structures.andM;Finally, however, a combination of updated mainframe software and newcommunications programs for PCs is helping to take the sting out of usingonline services.andM;A shining example is the two-year-old Connect Business Information Network.andO;Connect is different from other online services; it acknowledges that themachines connected to its mainframes are modern, intelligent personalcomputers, not dumb terminals.andM;Connect's communications software supports both PCs and Macintoshes.andP;  The PCversion of the software, called PC/MacNET, takes advantage of MicrosoftWindows to provide a simple, multiwindowed user interface, with support forsuch niceties as offline editing and gateways to a variety of other mailservices.andM;Point-and-ClickandM;Whether you access Connect from a PC or a Mac, its icon- and mouse-driveninterface makes moving from one facility to another--say, from thefile-down-load area to electronic mail--as easy as clicking on an icon orselecting a different window.andP;  to download a file, you simply click on it andConnect initiates an error-free protocol transfer.andP;  To copy text to a disk onyour PC, just use the mouse to select the file you want to copy and choosethe Save option from the PC/MacNET menu.andM;Connect's services resemble those of CompuServe and GEnie.andP;  It offerslibraries of software to download to both Macintosh and PC systems, as wellas public forums and access to news and information sources such as Standardandamp; Poor's stock quotes, the Business Wire, the Associated Press Online, andMcGrawHill, news services.andP;  Its Windows-oriented PC symposium offers users anextensive collection of Windows-related shareware.andM;Elegant E-MailandM;Connect's most important service, however, is its powerful electronic mail.andO;It provides full offline editing capabilities, so you can compose youroutgoing messages or read incoming messages offline, without worrying aboutincurring hefty connect-time charges.andP;  The mail editor lets you cut and pastetext, copy text from the Clipboard, rearrange paragraphs, and consult eithera personal offline mail directory or a general online directory to check IDsfor the recipients of your message.andM;These are all dramatic improvements over the online editors provided by mostservices, which tend to be about as flexible and forgiving as the DOS COPYCON command.andM;All Connect mail is transmitted using an error-free transfer protocol,another big plus for anyone who has evern experieinced the frustration offinding garbage characters in the middle of an important message.andP;  Inaddition, Connect allows you to attach binary files to your mail message andoffers gateways to MCI Mail, MCI Fax, and the DASnet electronic mailexchange.andM;An auto-connect feature lets you use the PC/MacNET software to connect to thenetwork ad send and retrieve mail automatically at preset intervals.andP;  You canalso set up PC/MacNET so that it automatically accesses the Connect networkand obtains from Standard andamp; Poor's service the current prices of as many asten securities.andM;Large Groups WelcomeandM;Connect provides special support to groups.andP;  Any organization that signs upfor more than 20 subscriptions can obtain its own private forum to use as anintraorganizational electronic mail service and bulletin board.andP;  Some 1,700companies and organizations have done so to date.andM;Connect's connect-time charges are among the most reasonable of all theonline services, starting at $8 per hour for 1,200- or 2,400-bit-per-secondaccess during peak hours ($4 per hour off-pead), with a $ 4 peak-hoursurcharge for 9,600-bps access.andP;  You can always get a billing summary online.andM;The PC/MacNET software costs $74.95.andP;  A new release, due this winter, willaddress the software's major shortcoming--its inability to perform backgroundfile transfers.andM;Of course, ideas as good as Connect's are bound to be borrowed.andP;  Some ofConnect's competitors are catching on to the need for a less user-hostileinterface to their networks.andP;  CompuServe, for instance, has recentlyintroduced new PC access software, called the CompuServe Information Manager,that offers many of the features of PC/MacNET.andP;  The Information Manager'scapabilities include offline editing, error-free transmissions, and theability to move rapidly around inside the CompuServe service.andM;For anyone who has ever sworn at the utter mindlessness of the userinterfaces of most online services, the Connect network and CompuServe's newefforts to simplify access represent remarkably good news.andP;  At last you canactually receive the benefits that online services have been promising todeliver for years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
