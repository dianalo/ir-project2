<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0329 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for quantitatively and visually assessing myocardial perfusionusing a new transmission computed tomography scanner and contrast mediainjection was devised. Myocardial perfusion was assessed before and afterpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Six patients withleft anterior descending coronary artery stenosis undergoing PTCA weresuccessfully studied. Cardiac outputs calculated from the ventricularcurves of the ROIs in the left ventricular cavity correlated well withthe thermodilution measurements using Swan-Ganz catheters (r = 0.90,p andless; 0.01). The ratios of myocardial blood flow (F) to the tissue elementvolume (V) were calculated (F/V) from the myocardial curves of the ROIsin the myocardium as parameters of myocardial perfusion, according tothe Zierler's principle. The F/Vs in the myocardium perfused by the leftanterior descending coronary artery before PTCA were significantly lessthan those of the control subjects (4.4 x 10/sup -2/ +- 1.2 x 10/sup-2/ vs 8.1 x 10/sup -2/ +- 2.9 x 10/sup -2/: p andless; 0.05). After PTCA, theF/Vs improved significantly (7.7 x 10/sup -2/ +- 2.0 x 10/sup -2/), buteven after PTCA, the F/Vs in three patients with old myocardial infarctionwere lower than those of three without myocardial infarction (9.1 x 10/sup-2/ +- 1.3 x 10/sup -2/ vs 6.4 x 10/sup -2/ +- 1.6 x 10/sup -2/), suggestingthat myocardial infarction may have a decreased vascular bed. For visualassessment, functional images were synthesized by deriving a functionalparameter for blood flow (PH/M1E) from the gammavariate fitted time densitycurves for each pixel. In all patients, before PTCA, decreased myocardialperfusion was imaged as dark pixels. After PTCA, myocardial perfusionimproved in all patients, but decreased perfusion was still observedin some.
