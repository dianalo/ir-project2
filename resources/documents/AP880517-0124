(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A motorcycle rider was stalked,knocked down and run over three times in a random killing as hisbrother struggled to pull him out of the car's path, police said.   ``There's no way in the world it can be explained,'' said policeSgt. Phil Mason of Sunday night's slaying in this Orange Countycity. ``Kind of like a frenzy. It could have been anybody.''   Three men were arrested, Mason said Monday.   Javier Sarabia, 26, of Garden Grove, and his brother, Alex, 21,were returning home about 11:30 p.m. when they noticed a cartrailing them, Mason said.   ``They were tailgating them so closely that the victim and hisbrother could not stop for their driveway,'' he said.   Alex, who was driving, continued to a corner and ducked down aside street before heading back, but found the car blocking theroad.   ``Those men went to the nearest corner and waited for them,''said the Sarabias' father, Hector, 60. ``Then they started yellingat my sons, `We are going to kill you. We are going to kill you.'''   One attacker aimed a revolver at the motorcyclists, and JavierSarabia jumped off and tried to knock the gun away, Mason said. Thecar then struck Sarabia down.   ``It passes over the boy, backs up and comes back around threeseparate times,'' Mason said. ``There's no doubt they knew whatthey were doing.''   His brother tried to pull Sarabia onto the curb, Mason said.Sarabia, who was not wearing a helmet, died of head injuries.   Witnesses reported the attack.
