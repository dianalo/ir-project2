Iowa, Connecticut and Oregon, with grants from the U.S.Justice Department, are undertaking &quot;day fine&quot; programs,which already are being used in Staten Island, N.Y., and inPhoenix, Ariz. In courts participating in the programs,criminal penalties can be based in part on what has been thedefendants' daily income.</LP><TEXT>   Many courts have been seeking alternatives to jail timeand supervised probation as they try to reduce costs. Theinnovative fine programs might do the trick. Advocates of theprograms also say they will bring in revenue to states,because judges tend to apply fines more often -- and finesare easier to collect -- when the penalties are linked toability to pay. Similar programs have long been used inEurope.   &quot;It results in fairer, more equitable and more enforceablepenalties,&quot; said Judith Greene, director of court programs atthe Vera Institute of Justice in New York. The VeraInstitute, which worked closely with the Staten Island andArizona pilot programs, is providing technical assistance forthe three states receiving Justice Department grants.   The new programs will test the proposal in a variety ofjurisdictions, including Bridgeport, Conn., Des Moines, Iowa,Salem, Ore., and three smaller communities in Oregon. Thestate courts will apply the income-adjusted fines inmisdemeanor and lower-level felony cases. California,meanwhile, is planning a pilot test of its own.   Judges participating in the program use itsrecommendations only as guidelines. The proposed fines aredetermined in two steps: First, a value is assigned based onthe severity of the crime. That figure is then multiplied bya daily-income value taken from a chart similar to anincometax table. The income table takes into account thenumber of dependents that the defendant supports.   William Carbone of the Connecticut chief courtadministrator's office said the income-based fines are seenas a more effective punishment than flat fines. The proposalwould be used only in cases where the judge decides a fine isappropriate; it could either substitute for jail time orprobation, or be used in conjunction with them, Mr. Carbonesaid.   Mr. Carbone said the court in Bridgeport was selected asConnecticut's test site because of the wide range of incomelevels of defendants sentenced there. &quot;No one is excluded,from the very poor to the wealthy,&quot; he said.   One drawback of the programs is that they don'tspecifically take a defendant's assets into account. But Ms.Greene of the Vera Institute said probation officialstypically inform judges of defendants' overall assets, andjudges are encouraged to consider that information inadjusting the income level for the fines.   Ms. Greene also said that in most of the state courtswhere the day fines are being tested, the defendants tend tohave low or middle incomes.   Usually, the adjusted fines are used for defendantscharged with property crimes and those who don't needsupervised probation. &quot;Primarily, what they are looking forare offenders who fit a profile that says they're not a greatrisk to the community if they are fined rather thanimprisoned,&quot; said Ms. Greene.   Although the test programs are new to the U.S., theyessentially standardize a process that judges traditionallyhave applied. The fines usually are within a range alreadyset by law. And judges have long based fines on theinformation that presentencing and probation reports provideabout defendants' financial status. &quot;Judges have always takenmeans into account,&quot; Ms. Greene said.   As they rely more on fines, courts also increase theircollection efforts, Ms. Greene said, adopting standardcollectionagency measures such as regular letters of noticeand issuing warnings when installment payments are missed.Connecticut will use part of its grant to improve itscollection system, Mr. Carbone said.   ---   PROSECUTORS ARE FIGHTING Illinois' new rules onsubpoenaing lawyers.   Federal prosecutors in Illinois have sued the attorneydisciplinary arm of the state's Supreme Court over a new rulethat restricts the subpoenaing of attorneys as witnesses ingrand jury and other criminal proceedings.   The rule prohibits the subpoenaing of attorneys unless theinformation sought is not covered by attorney-clientprivilege, is unavailable from other sources and is necessaryto the investigation. The prosecutor must obtain priorapproval for the subpoena from a judge following anadversarial hearing.   In their suit, the prosecutors argue that the rulerepresents &quot;unprecedented state judicial interference&quot; withfederal prosecutors and is an unlawful breach of the powersallocated to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution.   The prosecutors also have complained that the rule willset up too many roadblocks to questioning attorneys aswitnesses, and that they will be forced to expose the statusof ongoing investigations.   State and county prosecutors also have filed a jointpetition objecting to the Illinois rule.   A similar rule was adopted in 1990 as part of the AmericanBar Association's model rules of professional conduct, whichare used by many states as guides for preparing their ownrules.   So far, only a few states, including Massachusetts,Illinois and Pennsylvania, have adopted rules restricting thesubpoenaing of attorneys. However, Pennsylvania's rule, as itapplied to federal prosecutors, was struck down by a U.S.district court. That decision is being appealed.   ---   LAW FIRMS ARE NOT computer friendly, a study shows.   Lawyers may feel comfortable in the courtroom, but manyfeel inadequate in front of a computer screen. A survey ofthe nation's 442 largest law firms by Ernst andamp; Young, theaccounting firm, suggests that one in four practicingattorneys give up rather than try to resolve a problemencountered in using a personal computer. Nearly one in foursay they have to relearn how to use a PC each time they useit. And 58% say they want to learn how to use PCs in private-- and quickly.   According to the survey, only 13% of the firms provide PCsto all attorneys, yet 84% of attorneys surveyed say they'reinterested in learning more about the benefits of PCs. Amongmanaging partners, 83% believe computer training forattorneys needs to be easier and more effective.   The survey indicates computers are catching on at lawfirms. Three of four managing partners say they expect tomake a &quot;significant investment&quot; in computers soon. A similarpercentage agree there are important new uses of computersthat their firms could benefit from, including litigation anddatabase management, electronic mail and the ability to workfrom remote locations.   ---   DECHERT PRICE ABSORBS 19 lawyers from collapsed New Yorklaw firm.   Six partners, five special counsel and eight associatesfrom recently dissolved Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell andamp;Weyher moved to the New York offices of Dechert Price andamp;Rhoads.   Philadelphia-based Dechert Price abandoned merger talkswith Olwine, Connelly several months before the 40-year-oldNew York law firm folded in November amid partner defectionsand a rent increase. Paul W. Putney, managing partner ofDechert Price's New York office, said his firm was persuadedto bring in the lawyers by former Olwine Connelly corporatepartner Ronald R. Jewell, who the firm was trying to recruit.&quot;From there, it just grew,&quot; Mr. Putney said.   Most of the new lawyers joining Dechert Price's52-attorney New York office practice corporate law.</TEXT></DOC>
