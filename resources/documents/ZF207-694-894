(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Padilla, Fred.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>The article &quot;Birmy shows spooler, twin RIP&quot; in the July 19 issue (Vol.andO;19/20, page 46) contains two significant inaccuracies that contradict theproduces intended purpose, namely to provide PostScript users with improvedthroughput.andP;  While the article made a noble attempt to explain the chieffeature of the X-2, namely that it &quot;allows two jobs to be rasterizedsimultaneously,&quot; it failed to accurately describe the new product'sinnovative architecture.andM;The more serious inaccuracy involved the analysis of the double RIP's effecton throughput The use of two RIP's does not necessarily make a major speedimprovement, since a total job will have to be sent to a single RIP beforeoutput of each page can commence.&quot; (1) In current single RIP setups, theengine is a slave to the RIP and waits long periods (compared to rippingtime) for the next job, and (2) by rastering one job while a second job isprinting, throughput time is cut in half because there is no dead time whilewaiting on the engine.andP;  It was also inaccurately reported: &quot;it is notpossible to switch from one RIP to the other&quot;-not only can you switch betweenRIPs, but you can vary the resolutions.andM;Through one of our 16 simultaneously active interfaces (4 LocalTalk, 2RS-232, 2 Centronics, 8 OS-Network search directories), an intelligent usercan send multiple jobs or single pages of a job.andP;  The Q-Station assigns jobsto the first available RIP, which immediately starts to build the image andoutput even if the entire file has not been sent.andP;  Other documents thatarrive while the first RIP is busy are automatically routed to the other RIPand readied for output.andM;Thus, in the typical desktop environment, users are free to send jobs overthe remaining interfaces.andP;  A volume user, such as a Mac-based newspaper,could configure each LocalTalk name for a different department and the usersat these departments could all print through their dedicated LocalTaLksimultaneously.andP;  All four LocalTalks will have access to the first availableRip.andM;A faster alternative for PostScript is to output single pages as completed.andO;This means that a single chapter or newspaper section would not be held upbecause of a particularly complex page (a problem not uncommon for manyPostScript users).andP;  Color can be sent as separate pages for cyan, magenta,yellow and black rather than grouping aB four colors as one job.andP;  This allowsindividual RIPs to work on any page and gets around any limitation ofPostScript.andP;  This is a more logical approach as we all move to total platemake-up for printing presses.andP;  In the near future, we will be sending all ofthe individual process colors for a particular plate, such as cyan, for fourpagesup, eight pages-up or 16 pages-up before we send the other processcolors.andM;The second error involves a mistake in the description of our hardwareconfiguration.andP;  Our standard X-2 Rip uses 2 RISC-based processors with 8 MBeach (a total of 16 MB upgradeable to 24 MB) housed in a '386 with 4 MB.andP;  The'386 operates the Q-Station spooling software and uses a 100-MB drive forspooling.andP;  The RIPs have their own 330-MB drives for building completeimages, with total drive capacity in the standard X-2 reaching 760 MB(upgradeable to 2.1 gigabytes).andM;In short, you can see why we feel that our approach to multiple RIPs is theway of the future.andP;  Unfortunately, the article might cause a reader toquestion the value of dual RIP architecture.andP;  The truth is that for users whorequire faster output from PostScript applications, a dual RJP is a logicaladvancement.andP;  Fred Padilla, Project Architect Birmy Graphics PO Box 42-0591Miami, FL 33242andM;We agree that total daily throughput from a single marking engine could beimproved by using two RIPs in the manner described.andP;  But this would not speedup an individual job unless the operator slit the job up into two parts-forinstance, printing pages 1 -4 with one command, then pages 5-8 with a secondcommand.andP;  The recorder would image page 1, then page 5, then page 2, etc.andO;Many users could easily live with this.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
