 If the process is put in the context ofa general contractor, one can visualize the application of this process inthe construction of buildings, railroads, and other physical structures.andP;  Theconcept of systems integration in the information systems business has beenemployed by agencies of the U.S.andP;  Government, primarily the Department ofDefense, NASA, and the Federal Aviation Administration, for the last threedecades.andP;  IBM, through its Federal Sector Division (FSD) and its precursors,the Systems Integration Division (SID) and the Federal Systems Division, hasbeen providing systems integration services, primarily to the federalgovernment, for over thirty years.andP;  Applications include air traffic control,space, defense, and other information processing applications.andP;  Only recentlyhas this method of system acquisition taken a strong foothold in thecommercial information systems business.andP;  In 1985, IBM decided to use thecapabilities of SID to assist in solving complex problems for commercialcustomers.andP;  Thus it is through this process of evolution in the informationsystems business that SID moved from providing systems solutions almostexclusively to agencies of the federal government to being a systemintegrator for many of IBM's commercial accounts.andM;First, the process of systems integration is reviewed, including the roles ofeach of the major organizations that are fundamental to the performance of aproject and the benefits to our customers.andP;  Next, the application of theprocess to the development of the ImagePlus[TM] system is described.andO;Finally, we show how the ImagePlus project at USAA (United ServicesAutomobile Association) has become the prototype for many new applicationsolution development projects for a wide range of our customers' needs.andP;  (Asimilar project at Citibank in the same time frame has also become aprototype.)andM;The systems integration processandM;Systems integration is a comprehensive approach to solving a customerproblem.andP;  It addresses all aspects of the solution, including collection ofrequirements, design, development, manufacturing, installation, andmaintenance.andP;  The systems engineering approach to systems integration is atop-down, or requirements-driven approach, i.e., it starts from requirementsand works toward the solution using appropriate technology.andP;  This approachdiffers from the product development approach, which is bottom up---that is,a technology-based solution that develops a product for general application.andM;The role of the systems integrator spans the life of the system, as shown inFigure 1.andP;  IBM must, as an essential ingredient in the overall success of aproject, have an in-depth understanding of the customer's business.andP;  IBMworks closely with the customer to translate business needs into a completeset of system requirements before a system design can be defined.andP;  Iterationsto both the requirements and system architecture can be expected but must becarefully controlled.andP;  With the system architecture defined, external anduser interfaces are further defined.andP;  The system is decomposed into severalsubsystems, and the subsystems are decomposed into hardware units andsoftware modules.andP;  The overall system requirements are suballocated to eachelement of the system.andM;Many alternatives are considered in the specification and design of eachelement of the system.andP;  Through competitive analysis, make or buy decisionsare made.andP;  Off-the-shelf products from other manufacturers are produced byIBM and integrated with IBM products.andP;  Subcontractors and vendors areselected through a rigorous source-selection process.andM;During the development phase, preparations are made for integration and testof the system.andP;  As illustrated in Figure 2, testing is conducted at the unitand module, subsystem, and system level to ensure compliance with therequirements and design specifications at each level.andP;  The technique ofphased delivery of units and code modules is employed to facilitate an earlypart of testing and the orderly build-up of system elements.andM;The development of requirements and dsign specifications can be visualized asa &quot;top-down&quot; process with functions allocated to the subsystems but traceableback to the overall system requirements specification.andM;Well before the system is installed at the customer location, preparationsare made for training of customer personnel, including the users and thoseresponsible for system operation and maintenance.andM;Roles and responsibilities.andP;  The manager of a systems integration projectleads a multifaced team.andP;  Key members of the team will report directly to theprogram mangrer, but the success of the effort is also dependent on outsideorganizations: other groups within SD and throughout the corporation,suppliers, subcontractors, and the customer's organization.andM;The program manager interacts with many technical and business disciplines.andO;Given the responsibility and authority, the program manager controls theresources, manages interfaces, and provides overall direction to the project.andO;A program management plan is prepared at the outset of the project todelineate all key aspects of the project.andP;  Subordinate plans are submitted tothe program manager for approval, and the program manager is kept advised ofstatus and issues, so that corrective action can be implemented in an orderlyand timely manner.andM;Although the program manager retains overall responsibility for projectplanning, control, and risk assessment and management throughout the entireprogram, the organizational roles of primary importance shift fromorganization to organization as the project passes from one phase to another(Figure 1).andM;The role of systems engineering is shown in Table 1.andP;  The definition ofrequirements, system architecture, system interfaces, trade studies ofvarious implementation alternatives--all establish groundwork for the work tofollow.andP;  In the end, it is systems engineering that ensures acceptability andusability of the system.andM;Software and hardware development engineering groups are the next to take thelead role during the implementation phase of the program.andP;  Theresponsibilities of software engineering are listed in Table 2.andP;  Developmentengineering is heavily involved during the initial phases of the program andremains involved during the integration, test, and deployment phases toperform problem analysis and correct deficiencies.andP;  Should portions of thedevelopment work be subcontracted, these organizations will provide technicalleadership to the subcontractor.andM;Integration and test are the responsibility of an organization that is setapart from the development group as a means of providing the appropriatechecks and balances in the overall process leading up to customer acceptance.andO;As can be seen in Table 3, this group is involved from the early stages ofthe program.andM;Throughout the entire program, the systems integration organization issupported by many organizations, among which are procurement, qualityassurance, safety, reliability/maintainability/availability, human factorsengineering, plans and controls, and integrated logistics support.andP;  Systemsintegration requires a total team effort.andM;The benefits of systems integrationandM;Customers realize many benefits when they choose to acquire a new capabilityvia a systems integrator.andM;Single point of responsibility.andP;  In much the same way that a generalcontractor is responsible to the customer for all aspects of a buildingproject such as the requirements analysis, design, selection of materials,selection of skilled workers and subcontractors, and completion of theproject according to specifications, the systems integrator for aninformation system or application solution is responsible to the customer forall aspects of the process leading to the successful completion of a project.andO;This includes development of a comprehensive set of requirements, planning,design, acquisition, management control, training of the customer'spersonnel, installation, and continuing support during the operational lifeof the system.andM;Risk management.andP;  The systems integrator assumes responsibility formanagement of all risks associated with the project.andP;  Whenever possible, thesystems integrator and the customer prefer a fixed-price contract.andP;  The fixedprice protects the customer from the cost impact of surprises during contractperformance.andP;  To offer such an arrangement to a customer, the systemsintegrator must have a detailed knowledge of the customer's needs, the systemrequirements, and the technology, products, skills, and subcontractor basethat are required to achieve the objectives.andP;  The systems integrator willidentify specific risks and evaluate the potential impact of those risks inthe earliest phase of the program.andP;  Throughout the performance period, theserisk areas will receive particular management attention, and alternativestrategies will be implemented when required.andM;Application of customer resources.andP;  By utilizing a systems integrator, thecustomer minimizes the in-house resources required to implement a new system.andO;Thus, a customer can apply in-house personnel to the main line of business,rather than building a large information systems organization.andP;  It isessential, however, that the customer involve knowledgeable users of theproposed system in the translation of business needs into specifications ofsystem requirements.andP;  The systems integrator can provide the wide range ofskills required throughout the life of the program.andM;Cost advantages.andP;  The experienced systems integrator can offer the mostattractive cost for system implementation through the use of proven programmanagement techniques.andP;  The various elements of the system will be selectedin a methodical manner.andP;  Off-the-shelf products will be selected, wherepossible, to minimize the schedule and cost risks of development.andP;  Vendorsand subcontractors will be selected by a competitive process, and they willbe required to comply with procedures and quality standards established bythe systems integrator.andM;Finally, the systems integrator is not limited to a preconceived solution butwill provide one that is cost-effective and that is responsive to thecustomer's needs and objectives.andP;  The systems integrator applies knowledge ofthe customer's business, applicable technologies and products, and provenprocesses for requirements definition, design, development, and subcontractmanagement, as well as overall program management and control, to ensuresuccess of the systems integration project.andM;Systems integration applied to USAA policyandM;serviceandM;USAA (United Services Automobile Association) is a company that has alwayshad a commitment to customer service.andP;  Since its beginning as a small mutualinsurance company founded by a group of military officers, it has alwaysprided itself in its service to its members.andP;  Even as it has grown, it hasmanaged to keep its dedication to service.andP;  Additionally, it has a very lowexpense-to-premium ratio.andP;  It is a technically oriented company and has usedtechnology to keep its expenses down and service level up.andP;  A strategicobjective of USAA is to develop a paperless office.andM;The application which they chose for applying image technology on a largescale was policy service.andP;  In particular, they wanted the capability ofcapturing mail by scanning as it arrived in the building.andP;  From that pointthey wanted to index the material, route it through the office, store it,retrieve it, display it, and archive it, as appropriate.andP;  The archiving wasto replace paper files, thus simplifying retrieval, and was to be a permanentstorage medium.andM;USAA had been piloting this type of system with a computer-assisted microfilmunit and had done a large amount of human factors evaluation.andP;  They hadobtained significant feedback from the operators.andP;  They had awell-thought-out operational concept and a fairly complete set ofrequirements that were demanding but realistic.andP;  All of these factors, alongwith their commitment and reputation, made them an ideal account for jointsolution development.andM;Joint development.andP;  Prior to our decision to work with USAA on this effort,IBM had been studying various approaches to integrating use of imagesdirectly into a business application, as opposed to casual office use, andhad recently announced a family of image components including a display andscanners.andM;The opportunity to do joint development with USAA was seen as an excellentopportunity to work with an informed customer, test the validity of thestudies, validate the utility of our image components, and develop anunderstanding of the use of image capability, especially as it applied to theinsurance industry.andP;  Although USAA operates quite differently from otherinsurance companies, primarily because of its central operation with fewfield locations, the functions associated with policy service (e.g., newcustomer applications, address changes, modifications to existing policies,etc.) are still reasonably common to those of other companies.andM;Finally, IBM felt that working on a real systems integration contract withschedule deadlines and cost constraints would accelerate the solidifying ofproduct requirements and therefore accelerate the introduction of IBM's imageproducts.andM;Even before the complete set of requirements was collected, it was recognizedthat in order to meet the solution objectives, many IBM product developmentorganizations would be required to make changes to their components.andP;  Becauseof the complexity of the management problem and the need to clearly definefunctions and interfaces, SID was chosen as the integrator for the system.andM;The SID Gaithersburg site had overall responsibility for the systemsintegration and program management.andP;  It was the single point at which allactivities came together.andP;  In so doing, SID had responsibility for managingand coordinating contributions from a subcontractor, the customer, and theIBM locations listed in Table 4.andM;Requirements.andP;  USAA had a well-developed set of business needs.andP;  Theydirected that the system make maximum use of existing and standard componentsand that the deployment of the image system have minimum impact on existingoperations.andP;  Schedule and cost objectives were based on key businessmeasurements.andM;As a key functional requirement, USAA specified a storage hierarchy for imageand character data, i.e., direct-access disk storage for rapid retrieval ofactive data, an on-line optical library, and shelf storage for long-termstorage and disaster recovery.andP;  The system had to accommodate distributedstorage and retrieval of image data across four geographically separatelocations.andM;Many of the performance requirements were attached to activities that thesystem users could observe, including display time for the first image page,display time for subsequent pages, time required to scan a page and index adocument, etc.andP;  Decomposition of three requirements led to specific allocatedperformance requirements for each subelement of the system, e.g., the opticallibrary, communications network, image processor, workstation, etc.andO;Operational requirements also included usability, reliability, systemavailability, and serviceability.andM;Many alternatives were carefully analyzed to achieve a comprehensive set ofsystems requirements that met business needs and achieved the proper balanceof function, performance, flexibility, cost, and schedule.andM;Development.andP;  Specifying, as design objectives, that the system make maximumuse of existing components, including thousands of 3270-type displays, thatit interface with software being developed by USAA, and that it not bedisruptive to existing applications as well as provide interconnectivity toexisting facilities both local and remote led to a system partition shownschematically in Figure 3.andP;  The detailed implementation is shown in Figure 4.andM;The Folder Application Facility (FAF) is the software that USAA wasdeveloping for indexing and work flow.andP;  This application was installed in thesame processor partition as the existing policy service applications in anexisting IBM 3090 system, separate from the processor that would handle theimages.andP;  The Object Distribution Manager (ODM) and the storage managementsoftware, including the Object Access Method (OAM) were installed in an IBM4381 processor.andP;  Figure 4 shows that the FAF terminals interface with theapplication host directly.andP;  The host interfaces with the Image Storage andRetrieval Subsystem (ISRS) through an FAF to ODM interface.andP;  The FAF dataterminals and the ImagePlus workstations were implemented as two separateterminals to preserve the existing inventory of 3270 terminals and also toisolate the elements so that normal processing could occur in the absence ofthe image subsystem.andP;  It was also decided that image data should be treatedthe same as any other in terms of security, recovery, and other systemsservices, and that ISRS should operate in a Multiple VirtualStorage/Enterprise Systems Architecture (MVS/ESA[TM]) environment.andP;  The OAMwas a modification to the Data Facility Products (DFP) to give it thecapability to handle large objects.andP;  Finally, ODM is the traffic manager andinterface between FAF, which indexes and routes documents, and OAM, whichmanages the storage of the documents.andP;  Interconnection to remote workstationswas provided by the channel attachment of communication controllers as shownin Figure 5.andM;The configuration illustrated in Figures 3, 4, and 5 satisfied the businessneeds and functional requirements.andM;The requirement that the system provide for archiving as well as short-termstorage to allow display at a reasonable rate led to the decision to useoptical storage as part of a hierarchical storage management system.andM;The storage subsystem is illustrated in Figure 6.andP;  The system is capable ofstoring images on magnetic DASD, in an optical library, and finally, withremoval of the optical cartridges from the library, on the shelf.andP;  Thiscapability of staging allowed USAA to determine and set its own approach tostorage management, e.g., how long it would reside on the different media,how recovery and backup would be handled, and the ability to store differentresolution levels at different points in the system.andP;  Because of the largeobject size (about 50 kilobytes for a compressed binary, 200 dpm, 8 1/2- by11-inch page) and the use of write once optical storage, modifications wererequired to the storage management software.andP;  These software changes wereincorporated into the storage management software to provide management ofimage data using the same system software as used in managing coded data.andM;Development activity associated with the storage subsystem included selectingand testing the library and the optical drives.andP;  The interface to ODM wasdefined, and code was written to allow the handling of large objects.andP;  TheIBM 8232 LAN Channel Station as storage controller, based on the IBM 7532Industrial Computer, was selected, and code was written to manage the libraryand the stand-alone optical drives used for backup.andM;The management of the movement of images within the ISRS and thecommunications with FAF required SID to develop another module, ODM.andP;  Allfolder activities are handled by FAF.andP;  Physical storage of images is managedby OAM.andP;  All manipulation of images in the workstation is handled byworkstation software.andP;  Thus the role of ODM is an interface among all ofthese components.andP;  A router and a file server, ODM has the responsibility toensure that all operations are in synchronization and that documents areaccurately registered between FAF and OAM.andM;The requirement that the operator receive the image of the first page of animage document on the image display in five seconds or less and to seesubsequent pages in one second or less for planned work required furtherrefinements to ODM, the workstation, and the network.andP;  The ability to &quot;flip&quot;pages in a random manner after a document was retrieved was also deemedessential for an underwriting application and put further demands on theworkstation.andM;Changes to the microcode in the IBM 3174 Subsystem Control Unit werenecessary to increase the block size to be handled and thus improvethroughput.andM;To improve the response time in a planned work environment, the queuingactivity taking place in FAF is sent to ODM so that ODM can determine thelocation of requested information in the storage hierarchy.andP;  If theinformation is located in the optical library or on the shelf, ODM will issuethe command to move it to magnetic storage prior to the time it is needed bythe operator.andP;  This action is, of course, not possible in a random inquiry byan operator.andP;  However, it was felt that compared to having to call a customerback after an inquiry into the current archive, the slower response time ofthe library would still be acceptable for ad hoc requests.andM;Even after the above changes, the responses time was marginal for the firstpage display and for subsequent page display time requirements as well as forrandom page flipping.andP;  A special image adapter was developed that didresolution modification, compression, and decompression in hardware.andP;  Thesystem is based on placing the compression as close to the source or end useof the data as possible.andP;  To minimize the number of unique interfaces, theworkstation handles all scanners, printers, and displays by using a commonadapter and one set of workstation software.andP;  To improve response time, twoversions of the image are generated at scan time, 100 and 200 pels per inch(ppi) versions.andP;  The 100 ppi version is stored on magnetic DASD only and the200 ppi on optical media only.andP;  This separation gives improved displayperformance by keeping recently acquired data on DASD.andP;  The 100 ppi data areerased after a document is processed; however, the 200 ppi version is stillavailable on optical storage if required at a later time.andM;Finally, for the longer documents associated with special underwritingsituations, the document is brought from memory and stored on a hard disk.andO;The initial set of pages is handled by the image processing card, and thedecompressed images are stored on workstation DASD.andP;  After a page isdecompressed by the image adapter, the decompressed image is held onworkstation DASD to allow rapid, random, page flipping through a document.andM;The workstation configuration used is shown in Figure 7.andP;  This configurationconsists of a separate image display.andP;  In addition to developing theinterfaces to the image card, device drivers had to be written to interfacewith the various scanners and printers.andM;Because of its use in a production environment, a keypad was used rather thana keyboard to make processing simpler for the operator of the image terminal.andO;Note that Advanced Program-to-Program Communications for a personal computer(APPC/PC) was used to provide compatibility with Systems NetworkArchitecture.andM;Test and integration.andP;  Testing of a complex system requires the test to startat the lowest level of assembly and progress upward until all subsystems havebeen tested as individual units and as a system.andP;  This progression isrequired so that problems can be found at a level where they can be isolatedand corrected most efficiently.andM;The starting point for the test of the image system was the imageworkstation.andP;  These tests initially treated the workstation as a stand-alonedevice without communication capability to the image host.andM;Tests were run to validate the user interface and interaction between theimage manipulation functions on the image adapter and the various printers,displays, and scanners.andP;  The types of tests performed included scanning anddisplaying a document.andP;  These tests verified the image adapter and theindividual devices.andP;  Similar tests were made with the printer, which alsodemonstrated the capability to perform resolution modification from 200 ppito 300 ppi.andM;Test code was written to simulate the FAF code, perform folder functions, andtest the interaction between FAF and the ISRS.andP;  Other tests were run in theGaithersburg integration facility prior to installation in the customer'sfacility.andP;  Further tests and integration were completed in a mannerconsistent with the phased delivery shown in Figure 8.andM;Installation and production.andP;  Figure 8 illustrates the step-by-step manner bywhich the system was installed and tested in the customer's facility.andP;  Theapproach is to do stepwise increases in function, after collection of data ateach point and assurance that activity has met its goals, and then to proceedon to the next step.andM;The steps are reasonably self-explanatory.andP;  Step 1 emphasized user acceptanceof the workstation from a quality and usability point of view.andP;  Step 2 was atest of the system including the interaction with FAF.andP;  Step 3 was a livetest in a production environment at limited volume.andP;  Step 4 tested more areasat higher volumes and was the beginning of productivity measurements.andP;  Step 5tested the remote workstation capability and installed workstations to coverall logical offices.andP;  Finally, in Step 6, the emphasis is on installing theremainder of the workstations for production processing.andM;Solution developmentandM;IBM is engaged in a concerted effort on behalf of our customers to developmany new application solutions, with the primary objective of making ourcustomers more competitive.andP;  The Systems Integration Division provided earlyleadership as the systems integrator for many of these application solutiondevelopment efforts, working closely with customers, other IBM organizations,and IBM's Business Partners.andM;Solutions are being developed in every major business area.andP;  These effortsare market-driven, as evidenced by the participation of key customers inthese projects.andP;  The solutions are application-driven and are worldwide inscope and applicability.andM;The ImagePlus model serves as the prototype for many of these projects.andM;As embodied in the ImagePlus solutions, each application solution is acomprehensive offering that transcends the normal IBM product offerings toinclude specialized hardware and software applications, communications,systems integration, education, distribution, and support services.andP;  Asolution is based onaan architecture and industry knowledge that is enhancedby the participation of one or more key customers.andM;The Image Steering Committee in IBM is the precursor to the WorldwideOpportunity Council, which is the focal point for all of the applicationsolution projects to follow.andP;  The Image Steering Committee provides executiveguidance to the ImagePlus projects and serves as a focal point for resolvingissues that arise between the various IBM organizations that participate inthe projects.andM;The Worldwide Opportunity Council is chaired by the General Manager,Application Solutions line of business.andP;  The Council prioritizes and selectsnew opportunities targeted for IBM leadership that are worldwide in scope,and monitors progress of ongoing projects.andP;  The council resolves inhibitorsthat arise across IBM's various lines of business and coordinates strategiesthrough the corporate planning process.andM;In many cases, the Systems Integration Division had a leading role in thedevelopment and integration of new application solutions and the initialcustomer installation.andP;  SID Professional Services and similar IBM groupsthroughout the world then took the lead in the distribution and installationof the solutions to many customers.andP;  Indeed, the early ImagePlus projectsprovided the path for the application solutions efforts to follow.andM;Carl D. Avers IBM Federal Sector Division, 6600 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda,Maryland 20817.andP;  Mr. Avers was manager of Image Systems for the former IBMSystems Integration Division in Gaithersburg, Maryland, which was theorganization responsible for systems integration of the MVS/ESA and AS/400ImagePlus application solutions.andP;  He joined IBM at its former Federal SystemsDivision in Bethesda in 1965.andP;  He has held a number of technical andmanagement positions related to military and commercial systems development,communications technology, and signal processing.andP;  Currently he isinternational program manager at Federal Sector Division headquarters.andP;  Mr.andO;Avers received his B.S.andP;  in electrical engineering in 1964 and his M.S.andO;degree in 1965 from West Virginia University.andP;  He is a senior member of IEEEand a member of Tau Beta Pi and Eta Kappa Nu.andM;Robert E.
