Efforts to evacuate foreigners held by the rebels appeared tohave stalled early Tuesday.   A 60mm mortar round slammed into a squatter settlement near theMakati Medical Center about 6 a.m. (5 p.m. EST Monday). Ten peoplewere taken to the hospital, including a 6-year-old girl who died.   Two bombs exploded in the capital late Monday, wounding twopeople. It was unclear if they were related to the coup attempt,which began Friday and has killed at least 71 people and woundedmore than 500.   The U.S. Embassy recommended Tuesday morning that Americansliving in Makati remain in their homes but avoid upper floors, lestthey become targets for snipers.   At least three people were killed in Makati on Monday and 15,including one American, were wounded by sniper fire and shells.   Troops loyal to the government of President Corazon Aquino,backed by three armored personnel carriers, began moving undercover of fire toward the hotel district where the foreigners are.   ``Are we going to win?'' a colonel asked his men at the end of abriefing. ``Yes, sir!'' they shouted.   He told his men not to fire unless they had a rebel in theirsights.   The Japanese Embassy recommended that Japanese citizens livingin parts of the posh Makati district not under rebel control leavefor safer areas of Manila. It estimated 500 Japanese remained inMakati, including about 300 trapped in the hotels.   A statement telephoned to news organizations from a rebelspokesman, Capt. Albert Yen, said the insurgents would release theforeigners to dispel suspicions they were being held hostage.   The statement said the foreigners would be free to leave thehotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday and would be taken to Manila's airportaboard shuttle buses.   Yen said the move did not indicate the rebels were about to endtheir bid to oust Mrs. Aquino.   ``That's the farthest thing that we could do,'' he said. ``Wepledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the lastdrop of our blood.''   About 400 mutineers from the elite Scout Rangers were holding 22buildings in the Makati district, where many foreign embassies andresidences of foreign diplomats and businessmen lie.   About 400 rebels continued to occupy Mactan Air Base in Cebu,350 miles south of Manila. Their leader refused to surrender andthreatened to blow up the base's planes.   President Bush called Mrs. Aquino on arriving back in Washingtonfrom the Malta superpower summit and following a visit with NATOallies in Belgium to express concern for the lives of Americans inthe Makati hotels.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quoted Bush as tellingMrs. Aquino: ```I understand some Americans are in the hotels. .. .Can we get those people out? I'm very concerned about their livesand their safety.'''   ``She assured him they were doing everything possible to protectAmerican lives,'' Fitzwater said. ``Then the president ended theconversation by saying, `I appreciate your concern for thecivilians. We're proud of you for standing up with great courage.We want to see you succeed.'''   The United States provided fresh military supplies to the Aquinogovernment and promised $25,000 in help for civilian hospitals,said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.   The Japanese are planning to send three tons of emergency aid,including food, water and medicine to its embassy, said a foreignministry official in Tokyo.   Filipino Tourism Undersecretary Rafael Alunan prepared about 20buses to go into the battle zone and evacuate tourists to theairport. Alunan broadcast a statement over Manila radio stationstelling the rebels the routes the buses would take and that eachwould carry a white flag.   As the first buses prepared to enter the area, heavy firingbroke out. Officials stopped the buses in order to contact rebelleaders by telephone to make sure the deal was still on. Officialsplanned first to evacuate guests from the Intercontinental Hoteland if the operation was successful to clear out other buildings.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said 215 Americans werebelieved in three hotels in Makati.   Hospital sources identified the American wounded Monday asJerome Weissburg. They said he was hit in the arm by glass when abullet shattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel.They did not know his hometown.   The Manila Chronicle quoted military reports as saying nine U.S.servicemen from Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila, wereamong the trapped Americans.   Loyal forces said the rebels were contained in 22 buildings inMakati.   Snipers exchanged fire through the night.   Barbara Julich, a New York businesswoman trapped in theIntercontinental Hotel, was contacted by telephone and said,``Literally, we're in the middle. (We're) now low on food. Thereare babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and themothers are hysterical.''   The city's international airport reopened Monday but domesticair service was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed butgovernment employees were ordered to return to work except in theMakati area.   Officials reported shortages of food and fuel.   An explosion Monday rocked the compound of the Central Bank, theequivalent of the Federal Reserve. There were no injuries. A secondbomb went off in the Ermita entertainment district, damaging anunoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two women were injuredby flying glass.   Monday morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in Makati _members of the army's First Scout Ranger Regiment _ refused appealsto surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approachedtheir strongholds.   The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. Aquino, swept to power in a1986 military-civilian uprising that toppled President FerdinandMarcos, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communistinsurgency and economic problems. This is the sixth and mostserious attempt to overthrow her.   One of the coup leaders is Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, acashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. Aquino butlater led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained atlarge.</TEXT></DOC>
