The commentary in the Beijing Daily blamed ousted party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang for the notion that the party should stick torunning itself. It was one of the harshest attacks on the purgedleader in weeks.   After several months of steady media condemnation, the latestofficial comments on Zhao had taken a softer tone and credited himwith contributions to China's economic reform.   The hard-line commentary not only signaled that differencesstill exist in the leadership over how to treat Zhao, but put indoubt the future of political reforms.   In the past year, the leadership has slowly stalled or reversedon key elements of its economic reform program, which sought toreduce rigid central planning.   Political reforms were never given as much priority and weremuch less ambitious, but a basic goal was the separation of partyand government functions to allow government to become moreprofessional with a stronger legal base.   Both political and economic reformists had advocated reducingthe party's role in enterprises. Every enterprise has a partybranch.   The ``manager responsibility system,'' which allowed factorymanagers to make business decisions on their own as long as theycould earn profits, was adopted widely over the past decade andpraised for boosting production.   But the Beijing Daily, which has carried many of the media'smost hard-line articles since the June crackdown on pro-democracyprotests, condemned any efforts to divorce the party from theday-to-day running of the government and factories.   ``Reform of political structures and separating the governmentand party doesn't mean the two are getting divorced,'' it said.``It is intended to solidify the party's position in power andimprove and strengthen its leadership.''   It accused Zhao of weakening the party's base in factories, its``major source of strength,'' by emphasizing the role of thefactory director.   ``He put the enterprises' party organizations in an auxiliary,subordinate role,'' it said.   ``If the enterprises' party organizations are divorced from theimportant activities of production and business ... How can theyguarantee and supervise the implementation of party and governmentpolicies?''   If the party concentrates just on running itself, the papersaid, ``it can't be a political party, it can only be anafter-hours mass organization or a club.''   It added ominously, ``As party general secretary, how couldComrade Zhao Ziyang not know the party's nature and role? Hispurpose in putting forward the idea that the party only run itselfis very clear. ... Because of his erroneous stance ... the party'swork organization and full-time working staff have been slashed,people's thoughts are in chaos, and party building and party workhave suffered great damage.''   The 69-year-old Zhao was party chief for less than two yearswhen he was ousted in June after losing a power struggle triggeredby handle massive student-led demonstrations for a freer society.   He has not been seen in public since May, but party andgovernment officials say he is living comfortably at his home inparty headquarters in Zhongnanhai in central Beijing.   At a news conference in September, his successor, Jiang Zemin,said Zhao had made contributions as party secretary and,previously, as premier. Although Jiang did not say what Zhao's fatewould be, his mild tone was taken as an indication that he was notlikely to be put on trial for his alleged mistakes.   When he was ousted, the party said he had supported the protestsand split the party.</TEXT></DOC>
