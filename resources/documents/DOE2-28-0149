At this writing,there is considerable debate going on as to whether or not the US Congressshould ratify the INF treaty. The political issues are well known andunder careful examination. A critical element that still needs to beaddressed is the operational impact of the INF treaty. This area mayhave been neglected because nuclear weapons are viewed primarily as anelement of deterrence. Therefore, their warfighting potential is givenonly minimal consideration. This paper begins with a discussion of thehistorical use of nuclear weapons in NATO's defensive Alliance. It followsthrough to the decision in 1979 to modernize NATO's nuclear force. Thisdecision resulted in the deployment of the Pershing II and ground-launchedcruise missile (GLCM) systems in Europe. The Soviet warfighting conceptfor Europe is addressed next to place the intermediate-range nuclearforces in their proper perspective. This is followed by a discussionon the operational implications of the INF treaty. The paper concludesby briefly mentioning a few of the defensive proposals for the post-INFperiod.</TEXT></DOC>
