(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother faces a murder charge in themalnutrition death of her 2{-year-old blind, deaf and retarded childwho was found dead on the same day a judge had put her in thecustody of the state.   Bessie M. Clayton, 23, of Oxford, was charged Monday in the deathlast week of Anginetta Clayton. She turned herself in Monday and wasbeing held at the Lafayette County Jail in lieu of $50,000 bond.   Her lawyer, James Minor of Oxford, said Clayton would fight thecharge, but declined to discuss the case.   Officials said the girl weighed less than 10 pounds. The averageweight for a 30-month-old girl is 30 pounds, according to medicalofficials.   Alvin Chambliss, an Oxford attorney who appeared at Ms. Clayton'sbond hearing Monday, contended the Claytons were an impoverishedfamily cut off from public medical, housing and food assistance.   ``There are a lot of people to blame,'' Chambliss said. ``Thesystem broke down. To blame the mother is a travesty.''   Linda Clayton, the woman's sister, said the child had been sicksince birth, had trouble eating and was unable to keep food down.She said the child had been fed on Jan. 17, the day she died, butdidn't have proper medication.   The girl lived with 13 other people in a mobile home owned byLinda Clayton.   Youth Court Referee William T. Sloan had given custody of BessieClayton's five children to the state Department of Public Welfare onJan. 17 and left physical custody with the mother, said LafayetteCounty Attorney Ed Roberts.   In most cases legal custody means the children remain at home andwelfare officers monitor their condition.   During the custody hearing, Linda Clayton came to the JusticeCourt building to inform her sister that the child was sick. Courtofficers said Bessie Clayton could not leave, Linda Clayton said.   Roberts confirmed that Linda Clayton was not allowed to see hersister during the hearing. The child died before her mother arrivedhome.   After the death, Sloan issued an order giving the state temporarytotal custody of the other four children, Roberts said. He said itdid not appear the other children were malnourished.   Another hearing is scheduled Jan. 31, he said.   County medical examiner Buddy Roy said an autopsy determined thechild died of severe malnutrition and dehydration.</TEXT></DOC>
