The new variety, which contains a petunia gene, is expected tobe unaffected by glyphosate, a weedkiller sold by Monsanto underthe trade name Roundup. Testing begins this month and will continuethrough the summer at sites in Jerseyville, Ill.; Whiteville,Tenn.; and Stuttgart, Ark.   ``Glyphosate tolerance in soybeans would offer new productionpossibilities to American farmers,'' James W. Glosser,administrator of the department's Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service, said Monday. ``A single herbicide could be usedwithout fear of damaging the crop, rather than the mixtures andmultiple applications now necessary.''   Glosser said the agency has evaluated the scientific data andmethods to be used in the field tests and found them to be ``welldesigned and environmentally safe.''   Monsanto scientists engineered the new variety by transferring apetunia gene to soybeans. Greenhouse studies showed the new soybeanto be tolerant of glyphosate, and now scientists want to test itunder field conditions.   The USDA also has issued permits to a number of companies forfield testing of some other genetically altered crops, includingcotton and tomatoes, to see if they are resistant to weedkillingchemicals.</TEXT></DOC>
