The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic products, chemicals and pharmaceutical company cited strong earnings and cash flow as the reason for keeping Lehn andamp; Fink, which makes d-Con insecticides and Lysol disinfectant. Some analysts, however, said the company couldn't find a buyer willing to pay Kodak's price. Moreover, they contend the division still doesn't make strategic sense for Kodak.    Kodak's announcement, made by President Kay Whitmore to Lehn andamp; Fink management, was aimed in part at quieting apprehension within the division prompted by persistent rumors Kodak would sell the business.    Proceeds from any such sale were expected to help reduce Kodak's debt -- now 60% of its capital -- which was largely incurred in the $5.1 billion purchase of Sterling in February. Wall Street had estimated that the Lehn andamp; Fink business could fetch $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Last week, this newspaper reported that Kodak intended to retain the household-products operation.    Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said he believes Kodak wanted to sell the division but sought more than $2 billion to help offset huge tax liabilities. Under new tax laws, Kodak would have to pay taxes on the difference between the book value and the proceeds of the sale. Kodak wanted not only the value of Lehn andamp; Fink, but also to recoup the tax liabilities.    &quot;Kodak set a high price and couldn't sell it,&quot; contended Mr. Glazer, speculating that Kodak would be more amenable to a $2.5 billion offer. &quot;The bottom line is money. It's more attractive financially to keep it than to sell it.&quot; Moreover, since Wall Street generally perceived the Sterling price tag as too high, Kodak's stock would get &quot;whipsawed&quot; if the company sold the household-products group for too little, he said.    Mr. Whitmore said a study of Lehn andamp; Fink, which is based in Montvale, N.J., found it well-managed and highly profitable. Lehn andamp; Fink accounts for 30% of Sterling's $2.3 billion in sales. Analysts said Lehn andamp; Fink generated about $142 million of Sterling's 1987 operating profit of $361 million.    Mr. Whitmore said that while Kodak acquired Sterling mainly for its pharmaceutical business, Kodak's broader strategy has always included an expansion of the company's consumer franchise.    Kodak said it could help create marketing opportunities for Lehn andamp; Fink by telemarketing household goods and offering technology for new and improved products. Kodak also said Lehn andamp; Fink could market some Kodak products, perhaps in the area of home darkrooms or chemical formulas for its Eastman Chemicals unit.    Jay Freedman, a household-products analyst with Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., said he doesn't expect Kodak to make Lehn andamp; Fink a &quot;mainstream player&quot; in the household-products market. He said he expects Kodak to concentrate on Lehn andamp; Fink's strong brand names, like Lysol, rather than entering new markets.    Charles Ryan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said Kodak's main consumer thrust has been related to its broader imaging and information-storage businesses with floppy disks and videotape. &quot;I don't think insecticide and furniture polish are high priorities,&quot; he said.    Mr. Ryan said he believes Kodak will eventually sell the division, but not until next year. By then, he said the company will have more time to improve earnings in order to command a higher price.    Kodak said that Lehn andamp; Fink management is &quot;aggressively pursuing a program to reduce costs and enhance revenues&quot; and that the company expects savings in purchasing and distribution, sourcing, media buying and promotions. </TEXT></DOC>
