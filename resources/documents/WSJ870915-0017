MitchellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TCCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Telex Corp., stung by pricing pressures in its core computer terminal markets and by new-product problems, slashed its earnings projection for the second quarter ending Sept. 30 to about $14.6 million, or $1 a share, from about $21.9 million, or $1.50 a share.    The announcement surprised Wall Street analysts, who had been expecting earnings of $1.40 to $1.55 a share, and sent the company's stock plunging. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Telex closed yesterday at $51.875 a share, down $13.50.    In the year-earlier quarter, Telex had net income of $19.4 million, or $1.32 a share, on revenue of $204.9 million.    The Tulsa, Okla., maker of computer terminals and accessories didn't estimate second-quarter revenue. But it said it expects profit to improve in the fiscal third and fourth quarters because of new marketing efforts and increased efficiency in the manufacturing of its new product lines.    Full-year earnings should &quot;approximately equal&quot; the operating earnings of $77.9 million, or $5.28 a share, it had for the year ended March 31, Telex said. Net for the latest fiscal year was $77.2 million, including an extraordinary charge of $619,000, on revenue of $840.7 million.    The company's disclosure comes on the heels of a disappointing fiscal first quarter, when net rose 10% -- less than expected -- to $20.7 million, or $1.40 a share, from $18.8 million, or $1.28 a share. Revenue climbed 10% to $221.4 million from $201.2 million.    In July, Telex had told analysts that it incurred higher-than-anticipated start-up costs and marketing problems associated with its new products -- a line of computer terminals for International Business Machines Corp. mid-range computers and a new line of products that mix computers and telecommunications. But the company said at the time that it believed it could resolve the problems, and it estimated that second-quarter earnings would increase to about $1.50 a share.    &quot;A $1 (a share net) is disastrous,&quot; said Jim Poyner, a technology analyst with Dallas-based Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., whose earnings projections have been more bearish than most other analysts. He had expected per-share earnings of $1.25 to $1.40 for the second quarter and $5.90 for the fiscal year. &quot;There's a confluence of events here that aren't good at all. It was a little surprising that it's happened in such a speedy fashion.&quot;    Pricing pressure in the mature computer terminal market, Telex's main line of business, heated up last month when Hewlett-Packard Co. entered the commodity-like market. The Palo Alto, Calif., computer and electronics concern undercut practically everybody with a $695 list price on its HP-700/71 terminal for IBM mainframes; Telex's list price for a comparable terminal is $1,095, and IBM, the market leader, is generally higher. In addition, list prices are routinely discounted.    &quot;To come in with a list like that really dropped the ceiling,&quot; Mr. Poyner said, adding that he's seen terminals discounted to $625 for some large customer orders. &quot;It's going to take (Telex) a while to find enough niche products or different kinds of products to help offset this rapid margin erosion in their main line of business.&quot;    E.G. Frank, Telex's vice president, finance, said the company has boosted its cost-cutting and marketing efforts to try to improve earnings. &quot;We're now in a transitional year,&quot; Mr. Frank said. &quot;We're in new markets, and we have to learn how to sell better to those markets.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
