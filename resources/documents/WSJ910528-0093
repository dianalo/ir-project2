Congress is planning a new round of retaliatorytrade legislation aimed at Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, andthe National Association of Manufacturers has called for a&quot;complete re-examination of the U.S. relationship withJapan.&quot;   Their goal is to set the stage for &quot;managed trade&quot; withthe Pacific economies, even though they are increasinglyAmerica's best customers overseas. Both Taiwan and SouthKorea, for example, now buy more from the U.S. than doesFrance. If it is trade deficits that should set policy, it'sworth recalling that the U.S. deficit with Germany last yearwas twice that with Korea. Japan was again America's largestforeign market after Canada, and the U.S. deficit there hasnow sharply narrowed. It is likely to be gone altogether by1993, and the same is true for Taiwan.</LP><TEXT>   The explanation is that U.S. exports, especially to thePacific, have been rising much more rapidly than U.S.imports. In 1987, Americans bought $84.5 billion from Japan,and sold $28.25 billion there. The next year, Americanexports to Japan rose by almost $10 billion, while Japan'ssales here grew by less than half that. That meant a U.S.export rise of 34%, while Japan's sales here grew by 6%. Thesame thing happened in 1989: American exports to Japan roseby 18%, while Japan's U.S. exports grew by 5%. And in 1990,in a development hardly noted here, Japan's exports to theU.S. actually declined. In contrast, American exports toJapan again rose -- this time by 8%, to $48.6 billion.   If these trends continue, the end of the U.S. tradedeficit with Japan is in sight, as the first chart shows. Thesecond chart shows that the end of the trade deficit withTaiwan, the second-largest contributor to the overall U.S.trade deficit, is also close (see accompanying illustrations-- WSJ May 28, 1991).   There is every reason to believe these trends willcontinue, because American companies in every category havebeen mobilizing to export to the prosperous East Asianeconomies. American business has begun to recognize that itslargest and fastest-growing markets are in the Pacific. InFebruary, Northwestern Steel andamp; Wire obtained Japan IndustrialStandards certification for its products -- the certificationthat all steel companies, domestic or foreign, must obtain tosell their wares in Japan. This is the second U.S. steelcompany, after Chapparal Steel of Texas, to receive JISapproval, and Tuscaloosa Steel is now seeking JIScertification for its hot-rolled steel strips.   Scores of other companies, some as large as Microsoft, IBMand American Standard, have significantly expanded theiroperations in Japan in the past several years. Ford, whichhas moved its Asian headquarters to Tokyo from Melbourne, nowsells almost 100,000 American-made cars in Japan each year.Machine-tool manufacturers, like Hurco and CincinnatiMilicron, are now competitive in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.   A good illustration of this redeployment to the Pacific isthe number of U.S. citizens employed by American firms inJapan. In 1977, in all of Japan, there were only 338 U.S.citizens working for American non-financial companies. Fiveyears later, in 1982 the number had risen to 800. More recentfigures for American employees are not yet available, buttotal employment by U.S. non-financial companies in Japan hassubstantially risen -- from 82,000 in 1982 to 120,000 in1988. That is a 45% increase, and it is a safe bet that ofthat total of 120,000 people working for American firms, atleast 1,500 are U.S. citizens.   These strong behavioral changes in U.S. industry helpexplain why the trade deficits in Asia will soon be a thingof the past. Yet the managed-trade advocates now say eventhat won't matter. Clyde Prestowitz's Economic StrategyInstitute, working with the National Association ofManufacturers, has retreated to the old saw that Asia'seconomies mainly buy America's raw materials and commodities.Not so: Since 1983, 50% of American exports to Japan havebeen manufactured products, and since 1986 the ratio has been60%. Japan bought almost $22 billion in U.S. manufacturedgoods in 1988 -- more than Germany and France combined.   Even more interesting, about half those manufacturedexports to Japan are what the Commerce Department calls&quot;high-tech&quot; products. Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and HongKong bought even more -- $11.5 billion. About 30% of all U.S.sales to Japan are now high-tech goods, and for the foursmaller East Asian economies, the proportion is more thanone-third.   The pattern has continued since 1988, according to theCommerce Department's raw data for 1989 and 1990. U.S.high-tech exports to Japan were at least $12 billion in 1989,and in the first 11 months of 1990 they were $13.5 billion.For 1990 as a whole they should exceed $14 billion, or about30% of Japan's total imports from the U.S. South Korea,Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore are an even better market:about 40% of their imports from the U.S. now belong to thehigh-tech categories.   What this all means is that the export drive of Americanbusiness, aided by declines in imports from Asia, promises toeliminate the trade deficit as an issue.   ---   Mr. Gordon, a professor of political science at theUniversity of New Hampshire, is the author of &quot;New Directionsfor American Policy in Asia&quot; (Routledge, 1990).
