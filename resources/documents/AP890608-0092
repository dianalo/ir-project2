The report by the commission noted that there have beencontinuing concerns about outside species in the lakes, the sealamprey and smelt in particular.   However, in recent years, the number of alien species introducedinto the lakes has shown a significant increase.   Among the outside species that now threaten the lakes' nativelife forms are the alewife, the coho salmon, the Asiatic clam, thezebra mussel and the river ruffe.   The commission encouraged involvement by the coast guards of theUnited States and Canada in controlling the problem, and recommendedthat the nations ``take steps to prevent the further introduction,particularly the unplanned introduction, of exotic life forms intothe Great Lakes ecosystem.''   It was the first time the commission had made such arecommendation, said Frank Bevacqua of the commission's Washingtonoffice.   Some of the outside species were introduced for sport fishing.Others made their way into the lakes as hitchhikers on ships orthrough extending their range from bodies of water outside the lakesregion.   Although the new species are controlled by predators in theiroriginal homes, many lack predators in the lakes, ``and given anadequate food supply and appropriate life-support systems, ... theycan become a serious threat if they outcompete or destroy valuablenative species,'' the commission said.   The report also warned of increasing concentrations of toxicsubstances in Great Lakes animals, a reversal of declines recordedin the 1970s.   Waterbirds on the lakes, however, were producing more offspring,the commission said.   ``Populations that were once declining have increasedsubstantially, and reproductive problems in fish-eating birds aregenerally confined to specific sites,'' the report said.``Similarly, increasing bald eagle nesting sites are being reportedin the basin.''   The report gave no figures on increased toxic-substanceconcentration or bird reproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
