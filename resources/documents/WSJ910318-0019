Under the grant, the Texas Accelerator Laboratory at theHouston Advanced Research Center will build a superconductingmagnet three times more powerful than those currently used inMRI diagnostic scanners. At an MRI center at the Universityof Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, biologists will use theresearch instrument to study human physiology.</LP><TEXT>   The Texas Accelerator Laboratory was an unsuccessfulcandidate five years ago to develop magnets for the SSC. Butscientists there discovered that their magnet design hadunique shielding properties that reduced its interferencewith nearby electronic equipment, a major drawback of currentMRI technology.   Other members of the research group are Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory, the University of Chicago and IBM Corp.'s T.J.Watson Research Center.   The SSC, facing a tough budget fight, wants $534 millionin funding to begin construction.</TEXT></DOC>
