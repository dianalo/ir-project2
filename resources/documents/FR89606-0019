Authority</ITAG>This Notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 11001, 11002,11003, 11004, 11010, 11011 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1970 as amendedby the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C 6992 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Recent incidents of medical waste mismanagement resulted in enactment ofa two-year demonstration program for tracking medical waste from the pointof its generation to its point of disposal. The Medical Waste TrackingAct of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 6992 et seq., requires this demonstration programto be established in a limited number of States. Congress chose this optionin order to regulate medical waste on a small scale.In establishing the demonstration program, Congress intended for Connecticut,New York, and New Jersey to participate or to have a State program thatis at least as stringent as the Federal program. Congress also intendedfor the Great Lakes States (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio,Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) to participate unless the Governors of thosestates decided not to participate. Finally, any other States could participateif their Governors wished. Congress provided the States with a 30-day periodto decide whether or not to participate (i.e. the opt out/petition in period).The opt out/petition in period began with the date of the promulgationof the interim final tracking regulations 54 FR at 12326-12395 (March 24,1989), and ended April 24, 1989. The regulation identified the 7 GreatLake States, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut as ``Covered States.''54 FR 12373.EPA received several opt out and petition in notifications. As providedin Section 259.23, in this Notice EPA is removing as ``Covered States''the Great Lakes States that chose not to participate in the program andis adding as ``Covered States'' those States which have elected to jointhis program. 54 FR 12373 (March 24, 1989). As explained in the March 24preamble (54 FR 12336), now that the 30-day period has passed, EPA willnot consider any further additions or deletions to the list of States (id).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Participating States</ITAG>The following States, identified as Covered States in the Act, have electedto remain in the program. They include the States of Connecticut, New York,and New Jersey. The Governors of New York and New Jersey sent letters,available in the public docket, affirming their States' participation inthe program; Connecticut did not send a letter.The Governors of the following States identified as Covered States in thestatute and regulations have elected to opt out of the demonstration trackingprogram for medical waste. They include: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota,Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The letters from the Governors of eachof these States, indicating their decisions to opt out of the demonstrationtracking program, are available in the public docket for this Notice.The Governors of the States of Louisiana and Rhode Island and the Mayorof the District of Columbia, and Governor of the Commonwealth of PuertoRico, have petitioned the Administrator to be included in the program.The letters from the Governors of each of the several States petitioningfor inclusion into the demonstration tracking program are available inthe public docket for this rulemaking. The Administrator has reviewed thepetitions for inclusion and has determined that inclusion of these Stateswould provide a broader range of experience and information and therefore,a more meaningful demonstration program than if only New York, New Jersey,and Connecticut were included. Thus, this Notice amends the list of CoveredStates in andSection;andSection;259.10 and 259.20 to identify the followingStates as Covered States: Connecticut, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York,Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia. The regulatedmedical waste generated in these States will therefore be subject to theregulations at 40 CFR Part 259.Finally, EPA has modified the effective date of the March 24 regulationso that the regulated communities in the four States that petitioned-inhave until July 24 to come into compliance. EPA determined the extra timewould be necessary because the regulated parties in those States are onlynow being officially notified that their States are definitely in the newprogram, while parties in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have knownfor some time they would be regulated under the new EPA rules or equivalentState rules. Also, EPA has extended the comment period until June 22 togive all parties, including those in the new States further opportunityfor comment.EPA notes that certain sections of the regulations (e.g., andSection;259.61,andSection;259.78, and the incinerator and transporter report forms in AppendicesII and III of Part 259) refer to the June 22 date. Regulated parties inLouisiana, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, however,are not required to keep the required records and report on the periodof June 22 to July 23. Their first incinerator and transporter reportsthen will cover the period July 24-December 22, 1989. After this firstreporting period all parties will be in the same schedule and the demonstrationprogram will end in all States on June 22, 1991.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must determine whether a regulation is``major'' and therefore subject to the requirements of a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis. The Administrator determined in the Interim Final Rule that theMedical Waste Demonstration Tracking Program had a total estimated costof less than $100 million per year. The estimated cost was based on expectedcost for management practices and assumed that the 10 States identifiedin the Medical Waste Tracking Act would participate in the program. Sincethe seven States bordering the Great Lakes have opted out of the programand only four States, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the Districtof Columbia, have petitioned in, the Agency believes that the program costswill continue to be less than $100 million per year. Therefore, no RegulatoryImpact Analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert L.
