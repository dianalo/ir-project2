The sample analyzed for berylliumand lead shall be analyzed according to Method 104 and Method 12, respectively.(ii) Three samples shall be analyzed by atomic absorption for arsenic,beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, and zinc.The samples shall be analyzed for arsenic, beryllium, and lead accordingto Method 108, Method 104, and Method 12, respectively. The samples shallbe analyzed for cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, selenium, and zinc accordingto standard analytical procedures as recommended by atomic absorption equipmentmanufacturers.(4) During the initial performance test required by paragraph (d) of thissection, sludge samples shall be collected for the purpose of determiningthe metals content of the sludge. Samples shall be collected from the sludgecharged to the incinerator at the beginning of each run and at approximately30 minute intervals thereafter until the test run ends. The sludge samplescollected during each test run shall be combined into a single compositesample. During the performance test, three composite samples shall be generated.The composite samples shall be analyzed in one of the following two ways:(i) The composite samples shall be analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, chromium,copper, nickel, selenium, and zinc by neutron activation procedures, andfor beryllium and lead by atomic absorption according to Method 104 andMethod 12, respectively.(ii) The composite samples shall be analyzed by atomic absorption for arsenic,beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, and zinc.The samples shall be analyzed for arsenic, beryllium, and lead accordingto Method 108, Method 104, and Method 12, respectively.
