To us, reviving a whole region sounds tougher thanliquidating 1,000 or so savings banks.   But if so, you wouldn't know it. Germany is rapidlydealing with its problem. The U.S. Resolution Trust Corp.,charged with the Sandamp;L cleanup, looks more and more likedistressed-property management's black hole. Americans shouldbe demanding to know why they are paying for a huge failurewhile the Germans get results. We suspect it has something todo with a functional decline in America's politicalinstitutions.</LP><TEXT>   Months before full reunification a year ago, stateproperty in East Germany -- meaning nearly all property --was turned over to an agency called Treuhandanstalt(Trusteeship Institute), or THA. Its first Western director,Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, reorganized it and launched effortsto begin selling its holdings in mid-1990. But he wasassassinated by terrorists in April this year, which confirmsthat wiping out the vestiges of communism is not child'splay. Birgit Breuel, former finance minister of Lower Saxony,took over next and, undeterred, began pressing what THA callsthe &quot;sale of the century.&quot;   What a sale it is. As of last month, THA had sold 3,788businesses -- factories, utilities and the like -- some spunoff by breaking up vast and decrepit former state combines.Revenues have totaled only $8 billion but buyers havepromised to invest $50 billion to restore the properties andto create some 720,000 jobs. Because Mrs. Breuel chose tobreak up some of the 8,000 properties she inherited, shestill will have 6,400 left to dispose of at year end, but theTHA machine is whirring along. In addition, Mrs. Breuel hassold 20,000 small businesses -- shops, theaters and the like-- and $146 million worth of land. We wonder why U.S. thriftliquidators, with similar properties, can't do that?   What are the U.S. thrift liquidators doing? That is a goodquestion. Resolution Trust, created by Congress and theTreasury in 1989 to take over, reorganize, sell or liquidateinsolvent thrifts, just acquires more and more assets, ratherthan reducing the government's cat and dog inventory.   The Treasury initially estimated the bailout cost at $40billion, asking an added $10 billion as a &quot;cushion.&quot; Lastmonth, the General Accounting Office and Congressional BudgetOffice reported that RTC may run short of money even ifCongress doubles its current appropriation to $160 billion.   The difference between the U.S. and Germany is thatGermany seems to have a political system that still works.When THA's sales plans ran into a fundamental problem, whatto do about ages-old private claims to the property in itshands, Parliament changed the law. It said THA could go aheadand give clear title to anyone making an acceptable offer;old claims would be settled separately, in cash if necessary.There is plenty of political sniping at THA's wheeling anddealing, usually on grounds that it didn't get a high enoughprice or a buyer isn't fulfilling his investment commitments.But it hasn't stalled the process and eastern Germany isrolling steadily toward privatization of property.   The U.S. is rolling in the opposite direction, which mayhave something to do with why its national economy is lessvigorous than that of Germany, a nation that has more thanits share of problems as it tries to bring its eastern statesup to Western standards.   What is wrong in the U.S.? The fundamental problem is thatCongress wants to protect all its constituents, who in turncontribute heavily to campaign funds. If it continues on itscurrent course, it will end up protecting none.   The Sandamp;L fiasco came about because Congress gave Sandamp;Lmanagers unlimited federal backing, attracting high-flierswho raked off some of the money for themselves and put therest into bad investments. To &quot;solve&quot; the problem, Treasuryand Congress did nothing about its cause but merelycontracted to relieve the Sandamp;Ls of their trash. Moreover, theRTC was encumbered by so many rules -- mostly designed tokeep it from competing with those much-pampered banking andreal-estate constituents -- that it isn't doing much witheven the salable property it has.   A taxpayer bailout heading toward $200 billion representsreal money, with real economic consequences. By contrast,Germany's THA manages its still-vast holdings and pays itslarge staff on a budget of $22 billion a year. At its currentrate, it will liquidate itself altogether in a few moreyears.   RTC, meanwhile, just grows and grows. Is anyone still incharge of economic policy in Washington?</TEXT></DOC>
