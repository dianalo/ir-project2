 At least, it motivated this inductee to reflect onwhat has been most important during my years of government service.andM;The past couple of decades have produced many highs as well as many lows forthose of us who have endured life as government information technologymanagers.andP;  Two major events have defined my career.andM;Passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 are the two benchmark events that have shaped the role of thefederal information technology manager today.andM;Both have brought forth decidedly mixed blessings as they have been put intoeffect by government policy-makers.andM;The Civil Service Reform Act created the Senior Executive Service (SES).andO;Those of us occupying so-called supergrade positions at the time were giventhe &quot;option&quot; of converting to the SES, and almost everyone did.andP;  The idea wasto give up a certain amount of job security for the opportunity to attainsignificant bonuses for outstanding performance.andM;From top management's standpoint, the intent was to make career managers moreresponsive to the dictates of policy officials and to simplify thereplacement of SES members who didn't measure up.andP;  A sort of golden -- or atleast beige -- parachute permitted an unsuccessful SES member to revert to alover-level position.andM;How have things worked out?andP;  On the plus side, the SES has evolved intosomething approaching an elite corps of government executives.andP;  It isconsidered the capstone of a successful civil service career, much likeattaining a general's star in military service.andM;On the downside, the incentive system has not worked well.andP;  Despite complexperformance appraisal schemes, awards and promotions still tend to be basedon politics, cronyism and favoritism, just as in the past.andM;After a year or two of this, Congress felt impelled to undercut the intent ofthe act by sharply reducing the percentage of SES members who could receivecash awards.andP;  And with incentives curtailed, risk-taking by innovativefederal managers has been inhibited.andM;Like civil service reform, the Paperwork Reduction Act had a laudableobjective: to encourage federal agencies to view information as a valuableorganizational resource and to develop managerial approaches that wouldimprove its collection, storage and dissemination.andM;A positive result has been that the concept of information resourcesmanagement, has in fact taken hold in every federal agency, and IRM has beenelevated in importance in terms of the managerial attention it receives.andM;A few agencies, like Veterans Affairs, now deal with information resources atthe assistant secretary level.andM;The Paperwork Reduction Act, officially Public Law 96-511, was not aptlynamed, as much of it applies primarily to information technology andautomated data processing.andM;Other provisions were intended to reduce the burden of paperwork imposed bygovernment information collectors on business and the public.andP;  At the time ofits passage, I titled a critique I wrote &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; to suggest theact's heterogeneous components.andM;Perhaps the biggest difficulty in enforcing this act has been in the way theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has administered it.andO;This office, which the law established within the Office of Management andBudget, was preoccupied during the Reagan administration with using itspaperwork review authority to further the government's bent towardderegulation.andM;Every director of OIRA has had a background or an interest in deregulationrather than in information technology, which has been dealt with by lesserofficials.andM;Unhappy BrewandM;Within the agencies chronic unhappiness has brewed over OMB's data collectionreview authority and periodic attempts by Congress to defang OIRA byredefining its charter.andP;  As these battles have raged, the Paperwork ReductionAct's information technology provisions all too often have had to take a backseat.andM;But these two laws, imperfect as they are, engendered the biggest changes Ihave observed in the way the government treats its information technologymanagers.andP;  Interestingly, both laws came about during the Carteradministration.andM;In my next column, I will discuss more highlights -- and low lights -- seenover the past 20 years.andM;Robert V.
