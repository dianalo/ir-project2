Martin Luther King Jr.and helped inspire the war on poverty, has died at home after along bout with cancer. He was 61.   Harrington, a professor of political science at Queens Collegeof the City University of New York and honorary president of theSocialist International, died Monday night at his home in suburbanLarchmont, the university said in a statement Tuesday.   Harrington's book, ``The Other America,'' attracted nationalattention in the early 1960s. In all he wrote 16 books on theproblems of massive poverty in the midst of affluence and on thecultural stress associated with technological advance.   In a 1987 interview with The Associated Press, Harringtonrecalled how key individuals, including King and President Kennedy,made his book a rallying cry for issues they already consideredimportant.   ``The luck was that the book came out at a time when there was apresident of the United States who read books, John Kennedy, and heread it,'' Harrington said. ``It led him to decide to make povertyan issue in the 1964 campaign. He was killed before he could do itbut that set in motion the process that led Lyndon Johnson todeclare war on poverty.''   Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation, said of ``The OtherAmerica'':   ``It was one of the very few times that a book led to a federalprogram ... Ever since then there's been a new consciousness thatwe should do something about poor people.''   Harrington's latest book, ``Socialism, Past and Future,'' waspublished last month by Arcade Press.   ``Michael Harrington's intellectual energy, dynamism, and socialcommitment enriched an entire generation,'' City UniversityChancellor Joseph S. Murphy said in the statement. ``He was theconscience of America, a champion of the downtrodden andafflicted.''   Harrington, who became involved in social reform as a youth, wason King's advisory committee from 1965-68. He also was active inthe anti-war movement and the movements against apartheid in SouthAfrica and against American intervention in Central America.   He was a founder of the Democratic Socialists of America,serving as national chair and co-chair from 1982 until his death.   He was secretary of the Socialist International committee, whichdrew up a new declaration of principles in 1985. Last month,Harrington was named honorary president of the SocialistInternational at its centennial conference in Stockholm, Sweden.   He was chair of the Socialist Party from 1968-72 and of theDemocratic Socialist Organizing Committee from 1973-82. He was alsoa member of the Senior Seminar of the U.S. Department of State.   Harrington taught at the universities of Paris, Illinois,Michigan and California at Los Angeles as well as at HarvardUniversity and the National War College.   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees, said in a statement: ``More thanany other writer in recent memory, Michael Harrington helpedtranslate the dry and statistical analysis of poverty intopassionate, human terms, and in so doing he lent moral andintellectual strength to the notion that government can and shouldmake the elimination of poverty a primary goal for society.''   Harrington received his bachelor's degree from Holy CrossCollege and attended Yale University Law School. He received amaster's degree from the University of Chicago in 1949.   Harrington is survived by his wife, Stephanie Gervis Harrington,and two sons.</TEXT></DOC>
