In a three-hour meeting with Bush advisers and Republicananti-abortion leaders in Congress, Sullivan said he was an abortionfoe _ even favoring a constitutional amendment banning them _ ratherthan a supporter of women's right to choose abortion, participantsin the meeting said.   Sullivan's possible nomination drew protests from anti-abortiongroups after he was quoted last weekend in an interview with theAtlanta Journal and Constitution as saying of abortion, ``Thereshould be that right.''   But the senator and two congressmen he met with Wednesday likedmost of the answers he gave in their private meeting.   Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber said he had asked Sullivan about theinterview, ``and he simply said that he was not used to dealing withthe press, and he stumbled badly in his own words in handling thatquestion. But I am convinced of his sincerity on that issue.''   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, said in a statement that Sullivan``would make a fine secretary of health and human services if he isnominated. ... I believe he was misunderstood concerning his viewson abortion.''   The third congressmen in the meeting, Rep. Christopher Smith ofNew Jersey, said he was favorably impressed by Sullivan's answers.But he added later, ``I'm encouraged but not fully convinced.''   He said, for instance, that Sullivan did not seem ready to pledgethat he would oppose the use of government funds to pay for researchby the National Institutes of Health on fetal tissues.   ``He was not fully square with our position on that,'' Smith said.   Bush transition aides privately said that Sullivan remains thevice president's top choice for the post.   The aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said onereason Bush has not been able to go ahead with an announcement onSullivan was that the FBI background check on him had not yet beencompleted.   Transition spokeswoman Sheila Tate said Sullivan's position, ashe outlined it Wednesday, ``is entirely consistent with andcompatible with that of the vice president on the issue ofabortion.''   Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine, would bethe first black in Bush's Cabinet. He left the meeting withoutspeaking to reporters.   The vice president maintained a relatively low profile for thesecond day in a row.   He did meet with more than 40 prominent Republican Hispanics,telling them there will be no ``radical shift in direction'' fromReagan administration policies toward Cuba and Nicaragua.   Marta San Martin, a member of New Jersey's ethnic advisorycouncil from Union, N.J., said Bush told the group in private thathe would ``not abandon the Contras,'' the U.S.-backed rebels inNicaragua.   In his public remarks, Bush said the government in Cuba should``take a lesson from (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev and startlightening up.''   Transition aides said Bush is likely to name a group of Cabinetofficials in one batch either Thursday or Friday, waiting untilafter Christmas to complete the list. He has named eight Cabinetmembers and has six to go: HHS, transportation, interior, energy,labor and veterans affairs.   Meanwhile, Bush advisers told Chicago transit official SamuelSkinner to return home because announcement of his nomination astransportation secretary was being delayed yet again while decisionson prospects for other posts were being made.   Skinner has been back and forth between Chicago and Washingtonthree times awaiting the formal announcement. Aides said hisnomination was not hung up, but that Bush did not want to announceit separately.   Skinner did draw fire from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,concerning his conduct as a federal prosecutor in Chicago in thelate 1970s.   Metzenbaum said in a statement that the Senate should not vote toconfirm Skinner without investigating ``why (he) failed to pursueallegations of fraudulent testing of NutraSweet'' against G.D.Searle Co. and later joined the law firm that defended Searle in thecase.   When Metzenbaum first raised the issue in 1986, Skinner wasquoted as saying he had withdrawn from participating in the caseshortly after his office received a formal Food and DrugAdministration request for a grand jury investigation of Searle. Hesaid his actions were consistent with Justice Departmentconflict-of-interest policies.   A transition source said Patricia Diaz Dennis is a leadingcandidate for the labor post but that Bush aides don't know herpositions on various labor issues. The source said members of thetransition team have been speaking with those who have worked withher and will probably call her in Australia, where she isvacationing.   As for Sullivan, Rep. Weber said, ``I am convinced his positionis fully consistent with Vice President Bush's: that he believeslife begins at conception, that he is opposed to abortion except incases of rape, incest and where the mother's life in in danger, andthat he supports a human life amendment to overturn the Roe vs. Wadedecison.''   It was that 1973 decision that prohibited states from banningabortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.   During the campaign, Bush said he supported a constitutionalamendment to ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to savethe life of the mother.   Bush's transition office also announced several top White Housestaff jobs on Wednesday. David Demarest, former Labor Departmentspokesman and Bush campaign communications chief, will serve asWhite House communications director. Texas Air executive FrederickMcClure, who worked in the Reagan congressional liaison office, wasnamed legislative affairs liaison. Retired Air Force Col. AntonioLopez will serve as director of the White House military office, andRose Zamaria will be director of White House operations.</TEXT></DOC>
