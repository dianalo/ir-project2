Bill Godshall, spokesman for the Association for NonSmokersRights of Pennsylvania, filed a complaint with the Federal TradeCommission against Philip Morris Cos. Inc. for failing to includethe U.S. Surgeon General's tobacco warning in ads promoting``Accommodation: The New Sign of the Times.''   The nation's largest cigarette manufacturer placed ads innewspapers and billboards advising people to look for ared-and-green emblem at restaurants showing that they havedesignated areas for smokers and non-smokers.   Godshall on Monday condemned the campaign ``as an attempt toencourage people to smoke.''   But Philip Morris spokesman Les Zuke said the campaign is ``a wayfor the business owner to convey a special message to hiscustomers.''   Zuke said FTC rules require cigarette manufacturers to print theSurgeon General's warning that smoking can be dangerous to aperson's health on their products and in their ads. He said ads forthe Pittsburgh campaign promote an idea, not tobacco.   ``We wouldn't bring a campaign to Pittsburgh without checkingfirst,'' he said. ``We're promoting rights for smokers andnon-smokers ... courtesy and tolerance.''   More than 170 restaurants have agreed to display the emblem, hesaid. In exchange, the restaurants are mentioned in advertisementsappearing in the Pittsburgh area over four months.   ``We are not paying them anything at all,'' Zuke said.   Half of the sign contains a smoking cigarette against abackground of green. The non-smoker half of the sign is red.   Philip Morris said it chose Pittsburgh to launch the campaignbecause of the number of letters it said it received from customersconfused by a smoking ordinance that took effect last year. Morecustomers wrote from Pittsburgh than from any other city thatrestricts smoking in public places, Zuke said.</TEXT></DOC>
