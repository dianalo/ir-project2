 Of course, I had been involved in all the derigeur demonstrations: civil rights in the early '60s, free speech in themid-'60s and anti-Vietnam in the late '60s.andP;  But People's Park, then as now,struck me as an exercise in futility.andP;  It was an avoidable mistake both onthe side of the students and non-students who led the demonstration and onthe side of the university, which tried to assert its rights to the land itowned.andM;Before the crisis of 1969, what was to become known as People's Park was aconvenient parking lot four blocks from the university campus.andP;  Somebeautiful older homes had been torn down for future university expansion.andO;But in the hiatus between the razing of houses and the raising of a newbuilding, it stood as a deeply rutted empty lot that was convenient to parkin if you wanted to go and get a cappuccino on Telegraph Avenue.andM;It was kind of an eyesore, but some advanced-thinking students decided tobeautify it by planting a mild-mannered garden and started to use a portionof it for recreational activities.andP;  I remember a pretty good rock concert ortwo on People's Park land.andP;  However, the big bad university decided that thisunfettered use of People's Park for unauthorized activities had gone farenough.andP;  In an effort to get students and others out, it erected a hurricanewire-mesh fence one evening.andP;  This, predictably, infuriated the students andthe war began.andP;  Students protested, and the university met the protests withpolice action; students tore down the fence, and the university reacted bycalling in the National Guard and the California Highway Patrol.andP;  Onenon-student demonstrator was killed by police gunfire, lots of students werebashed on the head and it seemed as if everyone in Berkeley got tear-gassedby police helicopters passing overhead.andM;If the university had reacted with moderation, with mild-mannered negotiationand with benign neglect, the entire event could have been avoided.andP;  Theuniversity could have long since built its building, and a lot more peoplewould not have been deeply radicalized.andP;  Good students would not have beencriminalized over an issue as ridiculous as the disposition of a small plotof land.andP;  The youthful anti-authoritarianism of the '60s had so many other,more positive outlets.andM;Today the park is instead an ugly reflection of the once-proud spirit of the'60s.andP;  It stands as an incredible eyesore, home of drug deals and a place fordisenchanted middle-class teenagers to believe that they are actually streetpeople.andP;  And the university is once more engaged in a campaign to assert itsclaims on the land.andM;Why do I tell this story?andP;  Because we have a parallel today.andP;  The hackers oftoday's computer generation are not bad people; they simply have excesshacking energy.andP;  They break into computer systems not because they wantspecific information or because they want to cause havoc.andP;  They break inbecause of the challenge.andP;  It's important to distinguish between hackers andspies.andP;  Hackers try to crack systems and do so for the pure challenge.andP;  Spiestry to break into systems to steal information or to change information totheir own ends.andP;  Spies should be thrown in jail.andM;But hackers shouldn't.andM;We should use hackers' extraordinary ability to break into systems today as away to prevent serious spies from breaking in tommorrow.andP;  By applyingegregious civil penalties and or criminal penalties to the mischievoushacker, we stand in jeopardy of radicalizing them.andP;  That is, we will notdiminish their desire to break in, but we may cause them to be far moremischievous when they do.andP;  Instead, we should look for the conceptualequivalent of gentle negotiation.andP;  These often brilliant individuals can beturned.andP;  Rather than radicalizing them, it is entirely possible for us toharness their excess creativity to beneficial ends.andP;  Instead of criminalizingthem, we should congratulate them.andP;  We should, in fact, use their talents forour own positive ends.andP;  Let me explain:andM;Corporations concerned with the integrity of their systems should offerrewards to people who can actually break in.andP;  Special directories or evendedicated computers could be set up on corporate networks, using the mostadvanced and powerful security mechanisms that the companies develop.andP;  Burieddeep in the dedicated directory or computer would be a file with a secretpassword.andP;  A hacker gaining access to this file should be offered asignificant reward and a contract to work of the company to develop a moresecure system.andM;The employment tenure would end when the next person broke into the system.andO;Incrementally, more secure systems would be built, and ultimately we wouldhave a much greater degree of spy-proof computing.andP;  The native intelligenceof the hacker would be harnessed for positive rather than negative ends.andP;  Wewould no longer punish some of the smartest people in our society, but usethem for constructive purposes.andM;And real spies would find their job vastly more difficult.andP;  It is high timefor us to be bit more innovative in how we apply our laws.andP;  For inretrospect, the heavy-handed laying down of the law 20 years ago became, aswe were prone to say then, &quot;part of the problem instead of the solution.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
