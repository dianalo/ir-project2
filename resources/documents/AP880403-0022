About 1,000 worshipers _ half as many as last year _ attendedservices in the 12th century Church of the Holy Sepulcher, churchofficials said.   Many pilgrims were scared away by four months of almost dailyviolence in the Israeli-occupied territories that have left morethan 130 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. The GreekOrthodox Church canceled three pre-Easter processions scheduled forthe weekend.   Security was low-key Sunday at the Crusader-built church, whereabout half a dozen uniformed police stood guard in the courtyardand at the entrance.   But dozens of soldiers were stationed throughout the walled OldCity, some on rooftops and others patrolling the narrow cobblestonestreets. An Arab attacker stabbed an Israeli policeman in the OldCity on Friday.   ``Before we came, our friends were worried and said they wouldpray for us,'' said 71-year-old Arnold Rosenbrock, a Lutheran fromKankakee, Ill.   ``We've been fine, but someone was killed in Bethlehem yesterday(Saturday) a few hours before we visited,'' he added. ``There wereboulders in the street, and it was tense.''   ``We were frightened before we came, but now that we are here,we feel it is safe,'' said Philip Jiamachello, 31, of Houston,Texas, who attended the services with his wife and young son. ``Forme, this was a very moving experience.''   Tourism ministry officials said they had no figures for themonth of March, but acknowledged a 13 percent drop in tourism forthe first week of the month as compared with a year ago. Officialsalso expressed concern about possible cancellations in April andMay.   Clouds of incense and organ music filled the church during theLatin service held in front of the marble-enclosed tomb marking thesite where Jesus is believed to have been resurrected.   The Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, Monsignor MichelSabbah, the first Palestinian to hold the post, presided over theservice. Last week, he called on worshipers to make special Easterprayers for those caught up in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   At the church entrance, visiting pilgrims kissed and pressedtheir foreheads to the rose-colored marble stone where followersare believed to have washed Jesus' body before his burial.   Several worshipers dropped handkerchiefs to soak up some of theholy water that dampens the stone.   Others walked upstairs to the candle-lit table marking the sitewhere Jesus' cross is believed to have been buried.   ``One feels very humble walking on the same soil where Christwalked,'' said Gale Crisher, 48, of Long Island, N.Y. ``My childrencouldn't believe I was coming to Israel now, but I felt have verycomfortable here.''   While the Roman Catholics were celebrating Easter, Orthodoxdenominations were marking their Palm Sunday, walking along the ViaDolorosa, or Way of Sorrow, where Jesus, wearing a crown of thorns,was forced to carry the cross on which he died. Orthodox Christianscelebrate Easter this coming Sunday.   In the midst of the Easter Service, about two dozen chantingCoptic priests and choir boys in long dark robes entered the churchcarrying palm leaves, some formed in the shape of a cross.   Easter also fell on the third day of the Jewish holiday ofPassover, commemorating the deliverance of the ancient Hebrews fromslavery in Egypt.   Palestinian shopkeepers opened stores around the church frommorning until noon, the times permitted by the Palestine LiberationOrganization. The PLO has ordered afternoon strikes in Arab eastJerusalem to protest the Israeli occupation.   But even merchants who remained open complained there was littlebusiness.   ``I sold about $1,000 worth of items a day last year during HolyWeek. This year, I'm lucky if it is $100,'' said Mike Mannix, aJerusalem-born Palestinian and owner of a shop selling olive-woodcrosses and icons.   ``Last Easter my store was filled to the doorway and people werecrowded on the streets outside,'' the 32-year-old Mannix added.``This year, there is no one.''</TEXT></DOC>
