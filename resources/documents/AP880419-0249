(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of enhanced oil recovery projectsoperating in the United States fell by 28 percent over the past twoyears due to the sliding price of crude oil, according to anindustry magazine.   The projects, which are aimed at boosting oil recovery fromknown reservoirs, suffered from crude prices that were too low toprovide incentives for expansion and from a lack of capital toinvest in new projects, the Oil and Gas Journal reported in itsMonday issue.   The Journal's report came as about 1,000 industryrepresentatives attended a three-day symposium on enhanced oilrecovery methods beginning here on Monday.   Oil prices, which remain in the $18-a-barrel range, are forcinglarger American producers away from high-cost enhanced oil recoverymethods and into areas with quicker payoffs, said Lowell R. Smith,chairman of the Tulsa symposium and head of research for AmocoProduction Company's Tulsa facility.   A Journal survey indicated 366 active EOR projects in the UnitedStates, compared with 512 projects at the same time two years ago.Over the same period, production from enhanced recovery operationsincreased slightly to 637,000 barrels of oil a day.   Enhanced oil recovery techniques include the the injection ofsteam, gases or liquids into oil-producing formations. Thermalrecovery methods, mostly steam injection, account for about 73percent of the additional production resulting from EOR operations,the Journal said.   Some $960 million will be spent on enhanced recovery projectsplanned for 1988 and 1989 in the United States and elsewhere, basedon investment information for 76 projects during that period, themagazine stated.</TEXT></DOC>
