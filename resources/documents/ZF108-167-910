 The menu-driven mode becomes tediousbecause it is keystroke-intensive.andM;In both command-line and programmed modes, R:base accepts a subset of SQL forperforming queries and updates, but the primary query language is aprocedural language similar to dBASE.andM;Of the products reviewed, R:base implements the strongest notion of adatabase as an integrated entity.andP;  By this definition, a database consists ofthe following: multiple data tables, views and indexes; a single datadictionary; and a single set of data-integrity rules.andM;The rules, which can enforce both simple range checks and referentialintegrity conditions (values in one table must exist in another), are appliedin all operations against the database, whether performed interactively orunder program control.andM;This is the strongest implementation of data integrity of these threeproducts, even surpassing that of some distributed-database servers.andM;Unfortunately, R:base falls down in maintaining data integrity under accessby multiple sessions.andP;  Editing a table in tabular form is only possible if noother operations (even read-only) are being performed against that table, andit locks the whole table against all other access.andP;  (Concurrent reading of atable is allowed.)andM;However, when updating individual records, multiple sessions can edit thesame record concurrently, and the database reflects the changes fromwhichever session happened to perform the latest write.andM;Apart from that, R:base is an excellent vehicle for custom applications andad hoc interactive database processing.andM;Microrim Inc. can be reached in Redmond, Wash., at (206) 885-2000.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;R:base for OS/2 is pretty powerful, but it takes a long time to getproficient with it,&quot; said Robert Schumm, senior systems analyst forCommonwealth Edison Co., an electric utility in Chicago.andM;&quot;It's hard to learn the product effectively just from the documentation,&quot;said Schumm, who took Microrim's classes in order to optimize his use of theproduct.andM;Schumm is using the product to develop a specialized application that iscurrently running on a mainframe.andP;  Using OS/2 for development allows Schummto run background sessions as well as call other editors from inside R:base.andM;However, even though Schumm is developing in OS/2, he may decide to actuallyrun the application under DOS.andP;  &quot;One of the concerns with OS/2 is that itgets bogged down in the I/O,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You can help it out by indexing, butit takes time to read and write from the database.&quot;andM;Craig Ballam, data-processing manager for Hustle Amusement Inc., a video gamecompany in San Diego, saved money by running his application under OS/2.andM;&quot;OS/2 cost us a lot less [to run] because we could do on one computer whatwould have usually taken two or three,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;At the end of each monthwe have reports 600 or 700 pages long, and they take three hours to generateand another three hours just to print.&quot; Instead of tying up an entire day,employees can run these reports in background mode while still using thecomputer for other functions, he said.andM;Because R:base has a set number of columns for each database, Ballam foundthat he had to create several databases instead of one, but then he wasn'table to use the data-integrity function.andM;&quot;The rules table only allows for 21 rules -- it checks the first 21 andignores the rest,&quot; Ballam said.andP;  &quot;When building a form, you have to make surethat the most important rules are checked first.&quot;andM;In a multitasking operating system such as OS/2, the performance of anapplication depends on whether it is run in the background or the foreground,and on what other programs are running concurrently.andM;Database applications are especially likely to be run in the background,often concurrently with other database processing in the foreground.andP;  Thedatabases reviewed here were tested in both modes.andM;Foreground tests consisted of the following: importing 1,000 records from atext file while building an index on two fields; subsequent building ofanother index on two more fields; doing a sequential scan of the entire fileand replacing about 10 percent of the records; and exporting the records, inindex order, to a text file.andP;  The foreground timings were taken with nobackground tasks running.andM;The same tests were then run in both foreground and background, using thesame input file but different databases.andP;  Because the foreground tests werecompleted faster than the background, the foreground process was runrepeatedly to ensure that the background was never running alone.andM;Data Access Corp.'s DataFlex can build a secondary index for an existingdatabase through a utility program controlled by interactive keyboard input.andO;Although it is possible to write a batch procedure to perform this task inthe background, realistically it is not something a user would actually do.andO;Therefore, the indexing test for DataFlex was only run in the foreground.andM;As shown by the Specs table, execution times in the background were aboutdouble those in the foreground.andP;  Execution times for tests in the foregroundalongside a background process were from 10 percent to 30 percent slower thanforeground processes running alone -- but such a difference is hardlynoticeable.andM;-- Ted Mirecki</TEXT></DOC>
