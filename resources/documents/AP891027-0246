The commission, in a 4-0 vote Thursday, denied petitions byWilliams Telecommunications Group and the Independent DataManufacturers Association for reconsideration of the FCC's April 18order on Tariff 12.   That order had allowed ATandamp;T to continue offering Tariff 12 if itmade it available to all similarly situated customers. ATandamp;T madechanges in the offering to comply with the FCC's order, and thecommission's common carrier bureau approved those changes June 30.   Thursday's action was a final denial of the challenges to Tariff12, which ATandamp;T first offered to the Defense Department in 1985.Tariff 12 customers now include General Electric Co., Ford MotorCo. and Du Pont Co.   Also on Thursday, the commission, in another 4-0 vote, foundthat ATandamp;T's special Tariff 15 rates for the nation's largest hotelchain, the Holiday Corp., were illegal.   But the commission said the tariff was unlawful only becausecircumstances had changed since ATandamp;T made the offer in 1988.   ATandamp;T offered the Holiday Rate Plan at discounts of 5 percent to10 percent off its Pro America II rates and justified the rates asa competitive response to a discount plan MCI Communications Corp.wanted Holiday to buy.   But MCI subsequently said its plan was available to allcustomers. The FCC said that eliminated ATandamp;T's claim that it neededto make a special competitive offering to just one customer inresponse to MCI's bid.   Federal rules require that ATandamp;T must make plans such as Tariffs12 and 15 generally available to all similarly situated customers.   The FCC did not rule on whether Tariff 15 was legal at the timeit was filed, which ATandamp;T construed as a victory.   ``The FCC rejected ATandamp;T's Tariff 15 proposal on a very narrow,factual ground,'' ATandamp;T said.   Joe Naccio, ATandamp;T's vice president for business communicationsservices, told reporters the company had offered Tariff 15 to anIndiana company, Resort Condominium International, ``and we'regoing to honor that.''   ``We'll file more,'' Naccio added. ``We think the commissionessentially affirmed our right to do that.''   The commission made its determination even though an industrynewsletter, Communications Daily, reported Thursday that HolidayCorp. was dropping Tariff 15 in favor of another ATandamp;T offering.   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes also said he was ordering thecommission's common carrier bureau to begin an inquiry into whetheror not ATandamp;T should continue to be regulated as a ``dominantcarrier.''   ATandamp;T contends it no longer is dominant.   ``We agree emphatically with the FCC that the time is longoverdue to take a look at the fierce competion in the long-distancebusiness and the rules governing it,'' ATandamp;T said.</TEXT></DOC>
