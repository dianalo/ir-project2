The panel, in a voice vote, approved a bill that would initially ban shipments to Iraq of arms, other items that could have a military use and chemicals that could be used to produce chemical weapons.    Under a second tier of sanctions, the president could, at his discretion, impose further sanctions on Iraq. These sanctions could include a ban on U.S. agricultural exports to Iraq and a prohibition on imports of oil from Iraq. The bill could go to the House floor for a vote as early as next week, a committee aide said.    Earlier this month, the Senate passed a far tougher measure that would halt U.S. credit and sales of most materials to Baghdad, bar oil imports and require the U.S. to vote against loans to Iraq by international financial organizations. If the House approves the panel's bill, the two versions will have to be reconciled in a conference committee.    The Reagan administration opposes imposition of sanctions, preferring to use diplomatic pressure to dissuade Iraq from using chemical weapons. Earlier this week, Iraq's foreign minister said his nation wouldn't violate the 1925 prohibition against using chemical weapons. </TEXT></DOC>
