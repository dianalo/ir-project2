Here the authors address, in a logic programming environment,the problem of using integrity constraints at query time, in order tovalidate the query, i.e., to check if the query is inconsistent, thusdiscovering that the answer set is empty without scanning facts in theexternal database. The major concern of their approach is to exploitProlog mechanisms for finding out the unsatisfiability of a set clausesavoiding as much as possible to build on top of the Prolog basic system.In the present version, the query validation process applies to queriesnot involving recursively defined relations.</TEXT></DOC>
