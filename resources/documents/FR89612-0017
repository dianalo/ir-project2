The objectivesof this policy are to use the patent system to promote the utilizationof inventions arising from federally supported research or development;to encourage maximum participation of industry in federally supported researchand development efforts; to ensure that these inventions are used in amanner to promote free competition and enterprise; to promote the commercializationand public availability of the inventions made in the United States byUnited States industry and labor; to ensure that the Government obtainssufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs ofthe Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable useof inventions; and, to minimize the costs of administering policies inthis area.(b) <T3>Contractor right to elect title.</T3> Under the policy set forth inparagraph (a) of this section, each contractor may, after disclosure tothe Government as required by the patent rights clause included in thecontract, elect to retain title to any invention made in the performanceof work under the contract. To the extent an agency's statutory requirementsnecessitate a different policy, or different procedures and/or contractclauses to effectuate the policy set forth in paragraph (a) of this section,such policy, procedures, and clauses shall be contained in or expresslyreferred to in that agency's supplement to this subpart. In addition, acontract may provide otherwise (1) when the contractor is not located inthe United States or does not have a place of business located in the UnitedStates or is subject to the control of a foreign-government (see 27.303(c)),(2) in exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency thatrestriction or elimination of the right to retain title in any subjectinvention will better promote the policy and objectives of Chapter 18 oftitle 35, U.S.C. and the Presidential Memorandum, (3) when it is determinedby a Government authority which is authorized by statute or Executive orderto conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities thatthe restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subjectinvention is necessary to protect the security of such activities, or (4)when the contract includes the operation of a Government-owned, contractor-operatedfacility of the Department of Energy primarily dedicated to the Department'snaval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs and all funding agreementlimitations under 35 U.S.C. 202(a)(iv) for agreements with small businessfirms and nonprofit organizations are limited to inventions occurring underthe above two programs.In the case of small business firms and nonprofit organizations, when anagency justifies and exercises the exception at subparagraph (b)(2) ofthis section on the basis of national security, the contract shall providethe contractor with the right to elect ownership to any invention madeunder such contract as provided by the clause at 52.227-11, Patent Rights_Retentionby the Contractor (Short Form), if the invention is not classified by theagency within 6 months of the date it is reported to the agency, or withinthe same time period the Department of Energy (DOE) does not, as authorizedby regulation, law or Executive order or implementing regulations thereto,prohibit unauthorized dissemination of the invention. Contracts in supportof DOE's naval nuclear propulsion program are exempted from this paragraph.When a contract involves a series of separate task orders, an agency mayapply the exceptions at subparagraph (b) (2) or (3) of this section toindividual task orders, and it may structure the contract so that modifiedpatent rights clauses will apply to the task order even though the clauseat 52.227-11 is applicable to the remainder of the work. In those instanceswhen the Government has the right to acquire title at the time of contracting,the contractor may, nevertheless, request greater rights to an identifiedinvestion (see 27.304-1(a)). The right of the contractor to retain titleshall, in any event, be subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through(g) of this section.(c) <T3>Government license. </T3>The Government shall have at least a nonexclusive,nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practicedfor or on behalf of the United States, any subject invention throughoutthe world; and may, if provided in the contract (see Alernative I of theapplicable patent rights clause), have additional rights to sublicenseany foreign government or international organization pursuant to existingtreaties or agreements identified in the contract, or to otherwise effectuatesuch treaties or agreements. In the case of long term contracts, the contractmay also provide (see Alternate II) such rights with respect to treatiesor agreements to be entered into by the Government after the award of thecontract.(d) <T3>Government right to receive title. </T3>(1) The Government has theright to receive title to any invention if the contract so provides pursuantto a determination made in accordance with subparagraph (b) (1), (2), (3),or (4) of this section. In addition, to the extent provided in the patentrights clause, the Government has the right to receive title to an invention_<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><T3>(e) </T3><T3>Utilization reports. </T3>The Government shall have the right to requireperiodic reporting on the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilizationthat are being made by the contractor or its licensees or assignees. Suchreporting by small business firms and nonprofit organizations may be requiredin accordance with instructions as may be issued by the Department of Commerce.Agencies should protect the confidentiality or utilization reports whichare marked with restrictions to the extent permitted by 35 U.S.C. 205 orother applicable laws and 37 CFR Part 401. Agencies shall not disclosesuch utilization reports to persons outside the Government without permissionof the contractor. Contractors will continue to provide confidential markingsto help prevent inadvertent release outside the agency.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(h) <T3>Small business preference. </T3>(1) Nonprofit organization contractorsare expected to use efforts that are reasonable under the circumstancesto attract small business licensees. They are also expected to give smallbusiness firms that meet the standard outlined in the clause at 52.227-11,Patent Rights_Retention by the Contractor (Short Form), a preference overother applicants for licenses. What constitutes reasonable efforts to attractsmall business licensees will vary with the circumstances and the nature,duration, and expense of efforts needed to bring the invention to the market.Subparagraph (k)(4) of the clause is not intended, for example, to preventnonprofit organizations from providing larger firms with a right of firstrefusal or other options in inventions that relate to research being supportedunder long-term or other arrangements with larger companies. Under suchcircumstances, it would not be reasonable to seek and to give a preferenceto small business licensees.(2) Small business firms that believe a nonprofit organzations is not meetingits obligations under the clause may report their concerns to the Secretaryof Commerce. To the extent deemed appropriate, the Secretary of Commercewill undertake informal investigation of the concern, and, if appropriate,enter into discussions or negotiations with the nonprofit organizationto the end of improving its efforts in meeting its obligations under theclause. However, in no event will the Secretary of Commerce intervene inongoing negotiations or contractor decisions concerning the licensing ofa specific subject invention. All the above investigations, discussions,and negotiations of the Secretary of Commerce will be in coordinationswith other interested agencies, including the Small Business Administration;and in the case of a contract for the operation of a Government-owned,contractor-operated research or production facility, the Secretary of Commercewill coordinate with the agency responsible for the facility prior to anydiscussions or negotiations with the contractor.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(j) <T3>Confidentiality of inventions.</T3> * * * Accordingly, 35 U.S.C. 205and 37 CFR Part 40 provide that Federal agencies are authorized to withholdfrom disclosure to the public information disclosing any invention in whichthe Federal Government owns or may own a right, title, or interest (includinga nonexclusive license) for a reasonable time in order for a patent applicationto be filed. * * *<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>17.

If other rights are necessary to effectuate the treatyor agreement, Alternate I may be appropriately modified. In long term contracts,Alternate II shall be added if necessary to effectuate treaties or agreementsto be entered into.(4) If the contracting officer includes the clause at 52.227-11, PatentRights_Retention by the Contractor (Short Form), in a contract with a nonprofitorganization for the operation of a Government-owned facility, the contractingofficer will include Alternate III in lieu of subparagraph (k)(3) of theclause.(5) If the contract is for the operation of a Government-owned facility,the contracting officer may include Alternate IV with the clause at 52.227-11.(b) (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.227-12, PatentRights_Retention by the Contractor (Long Form), if all the following conditionsapply:(i) The contractor is other than a small business firm or nonprofit organization.(ii) No alternative clause is used in accordance with paragraph (c) or(d) of this section or 237.304-2.(iii) The contracting agency is one of those excepted under subdivision(a)(1)(i) of this section.(2) If the acquisition of patent rights for the benefit of a foreign governmentis required under a treaty or executive agreement or if the agency heador a designee determines at the time of contracting that it would be inthe national interest to acquire the right to sublicense foreign governmentsor international organizations pursuant to any existing or future treatyor agreement, the contracting officer shall use the clause at 52.227-12,with its Alternate I. If other rights are necessary to effectuate the treatyor agreement, Alternate I may be appropriately modified. In long term contracts,Alternate II shall be added if necessary to effectuate treaties or agreementsto be entered into.(c) (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.227-13, PatentRights_Acquisition by the Government, if any of the following conditionsapply:(i) No alternative clause is used in accordance with subparagraphs (c)(2) and (4) or paragraph (d) of this section or 27.304-2.(ii) The work is to be performed outside the Untied States, its possessions,and Puerto Rico by contractors that are not small business firms, nonprofitorganizations as defined in 27.301, or domestic firms. For purposes ofthis subparagraph, the contracting officer may presume that a contractoris not a domestic firm unless it is known that the firm is not foreignowned, controlled, or influenced. (See 27.304-4(a) regarding subcontractswith U.S. firms.)(2) Pursuant to their statutory requirements, DOE and NASA may specifyin their supplemental regulations use of a modified version of the clauseat 52.227-13 in contracts with other than small business concerns or nonprofitorganizations.(3) If the acquisition of patent rights for the benefit of a foreign governmentis required under a treaty or executive agreement or if the agency heador a designee determines at the time of contracting that it would be inthe national interest to acquire the right to sublicense foreign governmentsor international organizations pursuant to any existing or future treatyor agreement, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its AlternateI. If other rights are necessary to effectuate the treaty or agreement,Alternate I may be appropriately modified. In long term contracts, AlternateII shall be added if necessary to effectuate treaties or agreements tobe entered into.(4) Section 401 of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations providesthat in contracts with small business firms and nonprofit organizations,when an agency exercises the exceptions at 27.302(b) (2) or (3) it shalluse the clause at 52.227-11, with such modifications as are necessary toaddress the exceptional circumstances or concerns which led to the useof the exception. The greater rights determinations provision of 52.227-13(b)(2)shall be included in the modified clause.(d) (1) If one of the following applies, the contracting officer may insertthe clause prescribed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section as otherwiseapplicable, agency supplemental regulations may provide another clauseand specify its use, or the contracting officer shall insert the clauseprescribed in paragraph (c) of this section:(i) The contractor is not located in the United States or does not havea place of business located in the United States or is subject to the controlof a foreign government.(ii) There are exceptional circumstances and the agency head determinesthat restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subjectinvention will better promote the policy and objectives of Chapter 18 oftitle 35 of the United States Code.(iii) It is determined by a Government authority which is authorized bystatute or executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or counterintelligenceactivities that restriction or elimination of the right to retain any subjectinvention is necessary to protect the security of such activities.(iv) The contract includes the operation of a Government-owned, contractor-operatedfacility of the Department of Energy primarily dedicated to that Department'snaval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs.(2) Before using any of the exceptions under subparagraph (d)(1) of thissection in a contract with a small business firm or a nonprofit organizationand before using the exception of subdivision (d)(1)(ii) of this sectionfor any contractor, the agency shall prepare a written determination, includinga statement of facts supporting the determination, that the conditionsidentified in the exception exist. A separate statement of facts shallbe prepared for each exceptional circumstances determination, except thatin appropriate cases a single determination may apply to both a contractand any subcontract issued under it, or to any contract to which an exceptionis applicable. In cases when subdivision (d)(1)(ii) of this section isused, the determination shall also include an analysis justifying the determination.This analysis should address, with specificity, how the alternate provisionswill better achieve the objectives set forth in 35 U.S.C. 200.

In addition, an Alternate may be modified to provide for directlicensing by the contractor of the foreign government or internationalorganization.18. Section 27.304-1 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">27.304-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Contractor appeals of exceptions.</T3> (1) In accordance with 35 U.S.C.202(b)(4), a small business firm or nonprofit organization contractor hasthe right to an administrative review of a determination to use one ofthe exceptions at 27.303(d)(1)(i)-(iv) if the contractor believes thata determination is either (i) contrary to the policies and objectives ofthis subsection or (ii) constitutes an abuse of discretion by the agency.Subparagraphs (a) (2) thru (7) of this subsection specify the proceduresto be followed by contractors and agencies in such cases. The assertionof such a claim by the contractor shall not be used as a basis for withholdingor delaying the award of a contract or for suspending performance underan award. However, pending final resolution of the claim, the contractmay be issued with the patent rights provision proposed by the agency;but should the final decision be in favor of the contractor, the contractwill be amended accordingly and the amendment made retroactive to the effectivedate of the contract.(2) A contractor may appeal a determination by providing written noticeto the agency within 30 working days from the time it receives a copy ofthe agency's determination, or within such longer time as an agency mayspecify in its regulations. The contractor's notice should specificallyidentify the basis for the appeal.(3) The appeal shall be decided by the head of the agency or designee whois at a level above the person who made the determination. If the noticeraises a genuine dispute over the material facts, the head of the agencyor designee shall undertake or refer the matter for fact-finding.(4) Fact-finding shall be conducted in accordance with procedures establishedby the agency. Such procedures shall be as informal as practicable andbe consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. The procedures shouldafford the contractor the opportunity to appear with counsel, submit documentaryevidence, present witnesses, and confront such persons as the agency mayrely upon. A transcribed record shall be made and shall be available atcost to the contractor upon request. The requirement for a transcribedrecord may be waived by mutual agreement of the contractor and the agency.(5) The official conducting the fact-finding shall prepare or adopt writtenfindings of fact and transmit them to the head of the agency or designeepromptly after the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding along witha recommended decision. A copy of the findings of fact and recommendeddecision shall be sent to the contractor by registered or certified mail.(6) Fact-finding should be completed within 45 working days from the datethe agency receives the contractor's written notice.(7) When fact-finding has been conducted, the head of the agency or designeeshall base his or her decision on the facts found, together with any argumentsubmitted by the contractor, agency officials, or any other informationin the administrative record. In cases referred for fact-finding, the agencyhead or designee may reject only those facts that have been found to beclearly erroneous, but must explicitly state the rejection and indicatethe basis for the contrary finding. The agency head or designee may hearoral arguments after fact-finding provided that the contractor or contractor'sattorney or representative is present and given an opportunity to makearguments and rebuttal. The decision of the agency head or designee shallbe in writing and if it is unfavorable to the contractor, include an explanationof the basis of the decision. The decision of the agency or designee shallbe made within 30 working days after fact-finding or, if there was no fact-finding,within 45 working days from the date the agency received the contractor'swritten notice. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 203, a small business firmor a nonprofit organization contractor adversely affected by a determinationunder this section may, at any time within 60 days after the determinationis issued, file a petition in the United States Claims Court, which shallhave jurisdiction to determine the appeal on the record and to affirm,reverse, remand, or modify, as appropriate, the determination of the Federalagency.(b) <T3>Greater rights determination. </T3>Whenever the contract contains theclause at 52.227-13, Patent Rights_Acquisition by the Government, the contractor(or an employee-inventor of the contractor after consultation with thecontractor) may request greater rights to an identified invention withinthe period specified in such clause. Requests for greater rights may begranted if the agency head or designee determines that the interests ofthe United States and the general public will be better served thereby.In making such determinations, the agency head or designee shall considerat least the following objectives:(1) Promoting the utilization of inventions arising from federally-supportedresearch and development.(2) Ensuring that inventions are used in a manner to promote full and opencompetition and free enterprise.(3) Promoting public availability of inventions made in the United Statesby United States industry and labor.(4) Ensuring that the Government obtains sufficient rights in federallysupported inventions to meet the needs of the Government and protect thepublic against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions.(c) <T3>Retention of rights by inventor. </T3>If the contractor does not electto retain title to a subject invention, the agency may consider and, afterconsultation with the contractor, grant requests for retention or rightsby the inventor. Retention of rights by the inventor will be subject tothe conditions in paragraph (d) (except subparagraphs (d)(1)), (f)(4),and paragraphs (h), (i), and (j) of the applicable Patent Rights_Retentionby the Contractor clause.(d) <T3>Government assignment to contractor of rights in Government employees'inventions. </T3>When a Government employee is a coinventor of an inventionmade under a contract with a small business firm or nonprofit organization,the agency employing the coinventor may transfer or reassign whatever rightit may acquire in the subject invention from its employee to the contractor,subject at least to the conditions of 35 U.S.C. 202-204.(e) <T3>Additional requirements. </T3>(1) If it is desired to have the rightto require any of the following, when using the clause at 52.227-11, PatentRights_Retention by the Contractor (Short Form), the contract shall bemodified to require the contractor to do one or more of the following:(i) Provide periodic (but not more frequently than annually) listings ofall subject inventions required to be disclosed during the period coveredby the report.(ii) Provide a report prior to the closeout of the contract listing allsubject inventions or stating that there were none.(iii) Provide, upon request, the filing date, serial number, and title;a copy of the patent application; and patent number and issue date forany subject invention in any country in which the contractor has appliedfor patents.(iv) Furnish the Government an irrevocable power to inspect and make copiesof the patent application file when a Federal Government employee is acoinventor.(2) To the extent provided by such modification (and automatically underthe terms of the clauses at 52.227-12, Patent Rights_Retention by the Contractor(Long Form), and 52.227-13, Patent Rights_Acquisition by the Government),the contracting officer may require the contractor to_(i) Furnish a copy of each subcontract containing a patent rights clause(but if a copy of a subcontract is furnished under another clause, a duplicateshall not be requested under the patent rights clause); (ii) Submit interim and final invention reports listing subject inventionsand notifying the contracting officer of all subcontracts awarded for experimental,developmental, or research work; (iii) Submit information regarding the filing date, serial number and title,and, upon request, a copy of the patent application, and patent numberand issue date for any subject invention in any country for which the contractorhas retained title; and (iv) Submit periodic reports on the utilization of a subject inventionor on efforts at obtaining utilization that are being made by the contractoror its licensees or assignees.

The consistencyof the exercise of march-in rights with the policy and objectives of 35U.S.C. 200 shall also be considered. In cases referred for fact-finding,the head of the agency or designee may reject only those facts that havebeen found to be clearly erroneous, but must explicitly state the rejectionand indicate the basis for the contrary finding. Written notice of thedetermination whether march-in rights will be exercised shall be made bythe head of the agency or designee and sent to the contractor, its assignee,or exclusive licensee, by certified or registered mail within 90 days afterthe completion of fact-finding or 90 days after oral arguments, whicheveris later, or the proceedings will be deemed to have been terminated andthereafter no march-in based on the facts and reasons upon which the proceedingwas initiated may be exercised. (7) An agency may, at any time, terminate a march-in proceeding if it issatisfied that it does not wish to exercise march-in rights. (8) These procedures shall also apply to the exercise of march-in rightsagainst inventors receiving title to subject inventions under 35 U.S.C.202(d) and, for that purpose, the term ``contractor,'' as used herein,shall be deemed to include the inventory and the term ``exclusive licensee''shall be deemed to include partially exclusive licensee. (9) An agency determination unfavorable to the contractor, its assignee,or exclusive licensee shall be held in abeyance pending the exhaustionof appeals or petitions filed under 35 U.S.C. 203(2). (h) <T3>Licenses and assignments under contracts with nonprofit organizations.</T3>If the contractor is a nonprofit organization, the clause at 52.227-11provides that certain contractor actions require agency approval, as specifiedbelow.
