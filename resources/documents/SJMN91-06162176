But Jordan's fall-away jumpshot, quick moves to the hoop and ability to fire off assists knocked theLakers off their feet.;    Jordan scored a game-high 28 points in Game 4 anddished off 13 assists, matching his career playoff high. What would he havedone if he'd been able to comfortably stand on both feet?;    That's aquestion the Lakers, one game from elimination, probably don't want toconsider.;    &quot;It didn't look like (the injury) bothered him to much to me,&quot;Lakers Coach Mike Dunleavy said. &quot;Oh, I think it bothered him, but he played alot of minutes.&quot;;    Jordan was on the court for 44 minutes, but there were afew anxious moments during the first quarter when many people wondered howlong he'd be able to hang in there.;    A few minutes into the game, Jordandecided to abandon his custom footwear because the shoe, which had a two-inchgash across the top, wasn't providing him enough support to plant his feet,look right, fake left, dash right, leap, sail across the key and do all thoseother little things he likes to do.;    So, Jordan squeezed his swollen rightfoot into a standard shoe. And then he proceeded to put the squeeze on theLakers.;    &quot;I knew I had to play in some soreness and pain,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;Itwasn't that bad once I got loose. . . . It took a few minutes to get over thepain and soreness I've had and to get into a rhythm.;    &quot;I felt like I wasgoing to slip out of my shoe at first. I needed the regular one.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Inglewood  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910610  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  403  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 10, 199100162176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
