The 3,100 acres of private land consists of 20 separateparcels ranging in size from 10 to 599 acres. These lands are surroundedby or adjacent to national forest lands. The timber has been removed andnew stands of trees have been established on most of the private tracts.Of the 20 tracts, two contain river frontage on the Sopchoppy River. Thatriver is currently being studied for inclusion in the National Wild andScenic River System. If the proposed exchange takes place, the lands acquiredby the federal government would become a part of the Apalachicola NationalForest and would be managed to help achieve the multiple-use goals andobjectives established in the National Forests in Florida Land and ResourceManagement Plan. The agency invites written comments and suggestions onthe scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of thefull environmental analysis and decision-making process that will occuron the proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of howthey may participate and contribute to the final decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments concerning the scope of the analysis should bereceived by August 31, 1988 to ensure timely consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments and suggestions concerning thescope of analysis to Robert T.

That Plan gives direction for the identificationof tracts of land desirable for exchange. A tract of approximately 330acres of national forest land located adjacent to the Tallahassee airporthas been identified as meeting the criteria for being desirable for exchange.This tract is suited for exchange because it is isolated form other NationalForest System lands, it could serve a greater public need by being in otherthan federal ownership, and it is suitable for development by the privatesector. In preparing the environmental impact statement, the Forest Service willidentify and consider a range of alternatives for this tract. One alternativewould be to retain the lands in government ownership with management directionremaining unchanged. Another alternative would be to carry out the proposedexchange. Another would be to retain the lands in federal ownership withmanagement direction changing to provide for additional recreation developmentand use of the area. Other alternatives may be developed based on the resultsof the scoping process. John E. Alcock, Regional Forester, Southern Region, Atlanta, Georgia isthe responsible official. Public participation will be especially important at several points duringthe analysis. The first point is during the scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7).The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistancefrom Federal, State, and local agencies; adjacent landowners; and otherindividual or organizations who may be interested in or affected by theproposed action. This input will be used in the preparation of the draftenvironmental impact statement (DEIS). The scoping process includes: 1. Identifying potential issues. 2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth. 3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered bya previous environmental review. 4. Exploring additional alternatives. 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action andalternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connectedactions). 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. Scoping for this proposal began in early July when a mailing was made toknown interested and affected individuals, organizations, and agencies.Included on the mailing list were the property owners adjacent to boththe National Forest tract and the private tracts. This mailing includeda description of the proposed action, maps identifying the National Foresttract and the private tracts involved, and an request for assistance inidentifying issues, concerns, and opportunities associated with the proposaland the affected tracts. The draft environmental impact statement is expected to be filed with theEnvironmental protection Agency and to be available for public review byMarch 1989. At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability ofthe draft environmental impact statement in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availabilityappears in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. It is very important that those interested inthe management of the area between Lake Bradford and the Tallahassee MunicipalAirport participate at this time. To be most helpful, comments on the draftenvironmental impact statement should be as specific as possible and mayaddress the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternativesdiscussed (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementingthe procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40CFR 1503.3) In addition, Federal court decisions have established thatreviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure theirparticipation in the environmental reviews of the proposal so that it ismeaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions,<T3>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. </T3>v.<T3> NRDC, </T3>435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978), and that environmental objectionsthat could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raiseduntil after completion of the final environmental impact statement. <T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. </T3><T3>v.</T3> Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reasonfor this is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are madeavailable to the Forest Service at time when it can meaningfully considerthem and respond to them in the final. After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement,the comments will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparingthe final environmental impact statement. The final environmental impactstatement is scheduled to be completed by July 1989. In the final environmentalimpact statement, the Forest Service is required to respond to the commentsreceived (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the comments,responses, environmental consequences discussed in the environmental impactstatement and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decisionregarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decisionand reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision willbe subject to appeal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 28, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Leroy Jones, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Deputy Regional Forester. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-17633 Filed 8-4-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-11-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
