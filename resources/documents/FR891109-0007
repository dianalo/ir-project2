Background</ITAG>This regulation adds internal administrative implementation of the ProcurementIntegrity requirements of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy ActAmendments Act of 1988. One of the more administratively cumbersome aspectsof the Act is determining the most efficient means of obtaining the requiredcertifications of procurement officials and where best to file the certifications.This regulation requires that such certifications be included in the OfficialPersonnel File (OPF) of the respective procurement official. Furthermore,when a procurement official leaves the Government, the required certificationthat he or she understands his or her continued obligation not to discloseproprietary or source selection information will be accomplished as partof the normal personnel clearance procedure. This process is consideredmore administratively efficient and less subject to errors of omissionthan the procedure prescribed in the FAR. Consequently, a class deviationto the FAR has been processed.This regulation prescribes that organizations requesting contract servicesexceeding $25,000 provide the contracting officer a list of all procurementofficials and certify that each identified procurement official has certifiedhis or her understanding of the Act and that such a certification has beensent to their respective OPF.Guidance is provided regarding the conduct of investigations of suspectedviolations of the Act and how to process the resulting findings.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Pursuant to the memorandum from the Director, Office of Management andBudget, to the Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,dated December 13, 1984, this proposed rule is exempt from sections 3 and4 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)</ITAG>These changes are internal VA management policies and therefore publicparticipation is unnecessary (38 CFR 1.12 and 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). Sincea notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published,these amendments do not come within the term ``rule'' as defined in theRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2), and are therefore not subjectto the requirements of the Act. Nevertheless, these amendments will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
