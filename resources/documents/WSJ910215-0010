I mention this because this is something thatwould be very difficult to discern at autopsy, but anabnormal vascular pattern could be inherited. Such anabnormality may cause blood-cell aggregation (&quot;bloodsludging,&quot; as researched so thoroughly by the late Prof.Melvin Knisely) in the capillaries and not be detectable atautopsy.   The importance of considering this is that Prof. Kniselyshowed that anticoagulant therapy can restore the blood flow,and our clinical experience shows the anticoagulant canimprove and sometimes completely relieve the patient'ssymptoms. I have seen this happen in some, though certainlynot all, patients diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease.One patient who improved dramatically on four occasions withthe anticoagulant but was too advanced in the disease toallow discharge and died of pneumonia when treatment wasstopped was diagnosed as having Alzheimer's at autopsy. Thismade his responses to anticoagulant therapy of possibly verygreat significance as to the cause and treatment ofAlzheimer's disease. No one has followed up on this finding.</LP><TEXT>   Since CJD is a fatal disease and anticoagulant therapyover a four-month trial period has very little risk, thisapproach should be tried to see if circulatory factors areimportant. Obviously it is not the answer to the wholeproblem and does not appear to be related to the infectioustypes, but it is an easy approach to test and may producesome very important leads and may even cure some patients. My25 years' experience treating more than 500 dementia patientshas shown that anticoagulant therapy combined with standardpsychiatric care offer the best hope available at the presenttime; in 15% of patients the results are dramatic and in 65%successful enough to save them from nursing-home care. Surelythis is worth a trial in CJD.   Arthur C. Walsh, M.D.   Pittsburgh</TEXT></DOC>
