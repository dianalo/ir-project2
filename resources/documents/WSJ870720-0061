The Postal Service's three-year pact with the American Postal Workers Union and the National Association of Letter Carriers expires at midnight EDT tonight.    The unions, which are bargaining jointly for the approximately 600,000 workers they represent, broke off negotiations with postal officials last week. They charged the agency had made an &quot;under-the-table&quot; agreement with the smaller Mail Handlers Union to transfer to it about 10,000 jobs now controlled by the Postal Workers.    A spokesman for the two larger unions said both sides have signed a memorandum of understanding that guarantees the 10,000 jobs will remain under the Postal Workers' jurisdiction. A spokesman for the Postal Service said the memorandum resolved the unions' concern, but declined to comment further.    Before the talks broke off last week the major unions had said they were seeking a 6.8% wage increase in each of the next three years. The Mail Handlers' agreement, which has been endorsed by union leaders, calls for an average 1.6% pay increase in each of the next three years. </TEXT></DOC>
