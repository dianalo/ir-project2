Chun Kyung-hwan was arrested early Thursday on charges heembezzled $10.4 million while head of the semi-official SaemaulUndong (New Community) development organization. He also wascharged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evading taxes andviolating business, land and construction laws.   If convicted, Chun, 46, could receive a sentence ranging from 10years in prison to death.   ``Our investigation will continue to check other charges that hediverted a huge amount of money for land speculation in the UnitedStates and Australia,'' senior prosecutor Kang Won-il toldreporters.   Eight other people, including aides of the younger Chun andother senior Saemaul officials, also were arrested on embezzlement,bribery and other charges, officials said. They included the formerpresident's two brothers-in-law.   ``It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to mybrother,'' prosecutors quoted the younger Chun as saying.   According to the arrest warrant, the younger Chun amassed afortune in cash, land and stocks by using government and familyconnections.   He was named head of Saemaul Undong in 1981, the year after hisbrother seized power with military backing, and resigned the postin 1987 after reports linked him to criminals.   Meanwhile, opposition parties charged Thursday that thegovernment was covering up massive corruption in the scandal, anddemanded the former president be questioned in the probe.   ``The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooledthe people,'' the Reunification Democratic Party said in astatement.   The party, one of two main opposition groups, demanded Chun bequestioned about charges of widespread corruption during hisseven-year rule, which ended Feb. 24.   Authorities have questioned some 200 politicians and businessleaders about corruption or trying to cover it up to protect formerPresident Chun and his family, but none has been formallyimplicated.   Kang said Thursday he did not plan to expand the investigationto uncover other crimes under Chun because most such cases wereclosed through trials.   Many observers here believe the probe of Saemaul, which overseesrural and urban development projects, is part of efforts byPresident Roh Tae-woo to distance himself from his authoritarianpredecessor.   In his presidential campaign pledge in December, Roh said hewould investigate all irregularities under Chun. The formerpresident has not been implicated in the scandal.   Government officials said Thursday that Roh will register hisassets with government agencies to show his determination toestablish a clean government.   The officials said Roh has urged the Ministry of GovernmentAdministration to carry out administrative reforms, including theproperty registration of high-ranking government officials.</TEXT></DOC>
