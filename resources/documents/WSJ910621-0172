Shareholders arebeginning to use executive compensation as a new tool ofcorporate accountability. The increased interest fromshareholders in this year's proxy season is only thebeginning.   You are also correct in suggesting that much of theinterest in executive pay is &quot;demagogy.&quot; The public seems tobe outraged over the wrong thing: Just about every articleand discussion focus on how much an executive &quot;earned&quot; in asingle year by cashing in options. As every CEO will pointout, these options may have accumulated over a 10-yearperiod. If the CEO happens to exercise all those options in adown year, all he really is guilty of is bad timing. Theappropriate time to look at executive pay is when the optiongrants are first made. Are the term and size of the grantsreasonable in relation to executive and company performancethat year? Do they provide proper incentives, or are theyjust giveaways? And so on.</LP><TEXT>   With that said, I wonder if you miss the real point aboutshareholder interest in executive compensation. Shareholdersview compensation not just as a tool of accountability, butalso as an incentive device. Too few of today's corporateofficers understand that they are, in effect, asset managers.If the current mix of assets is not providing as much valueas it could to those who own the company and who put theirmoney at risk -- the shareholders -- management is obligatedto reshuffle the mix. Sometimes it takes a Carl Icahn to comealong, as he did with USX, to prod management intoreshuffling the mix. But there are not enough Icahns aroundto do this in every case, nor will most institutionalshareholders ever take as public and aggressive an action asdid Mr. Icahn.   But there are tools for shareholders to use to motivatemanagement to behave as real asset managers, and compensationhappens to be one of the strongest. To wit: Do you not thinkcorporate performance and management incentives would bedrastically different if executive pay were limited to acertain dollar amount, with any additional compensationtotally dependent on shareholder returns? I do not advocatean annual pay cap, but framing the question this way leads tosome interesting conclusions.   Shareholder interest in compensation does not end withmanagement. It is already extending to the board as well, asit should. In the end, the board is the primary guardian forthe shareholders. Properly &quot;incentivized,&quot; directors, too,might change the way they see their roles.   Howard D. Sherman   Vice President   Institutional Shareholder Services   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
