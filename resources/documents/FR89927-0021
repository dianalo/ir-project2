The agencyis also revising the authority citations for 21 CFR parts 1 through 1250in this final rule to conform to these revised procedures in andSection;1.4.

Rada Proehl, Office of RegulatoryAffairs (HFC-222), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,MD 20857, 301-443-2994.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 2, 1988 (53 FR 2827), FDA codifiedin a new andSection; 1.4 its procedures for including authority citationsin the agency's regulations in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.As discussed in the preamble of that final rule, the agency would completeits review and revision of all the authority citations in 21 CFR parts1 to 1299 in 1989. This final rule includes minor editorial revisions to andSection; 1.4 thatwere found to be necessary as a result of its review of existing authoritycitations. Because there will be no authorities cited at the subpart level,andSection; 1.4(a) has been revised to indicate that all citations are centralizedonly at the part level. Consistent with revised andSection; 1.4(a), andSection;1.4(b) has been revised to remove references to authorities at the subpartlevel. As discussed in the preamble to the February 2, 1988, final rule(53 FR 2827 at 2828) and required by revised andSection; 1.4(b), the agencymay rely on any one or more of the authorities that are listed for a particularpart to implement or to enforce any section in that part. Section 1.4(c)has been revised to address the format that the agency will use in citingto such organic statutes as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, thePublic Health Service Act, or the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act thatare enforced by FDA, and it includes an example. Section 1.4(d) is a newparagraph that specifies the format that the agency will use to cite statutesenforced by FDA, other than those specified in andSection; 1.4(c), and itincludes an example. Section 1.4(e), formerly included in andSection; 1.4(c),specifies that where there is no applicable United States Code (U.S.C.)authority for a regulation, the agency will include a citation to the U.S.Statutes at Large. Paragraph (e) is further revised to refer to the volumeand page of the U.S. Statutes at Large, rather than the section, page,and volume as currently required by andSection; 1.4(c). Section 1.4(f) iscurrent andSection; 1.4(d) which specifies that the agency will include acitation to executive delegations (i.e., Executive Orders), if any, necessaryto link the statutory authority to the agency. In addition, this final rule completes the revision of all authority citationsfor the agency's regulations by revising the authority citations in 21CFR parts 1 to 1250 (21 CFR parts 1251 to 1299 are reserved) to complywith the revised procedures in andSection; 1.4. Although the authority citationfor 21 CFR part 1 was revised on February 2, 1988 (53 FR 2827 at 2828),it is further revised to include a citation to the Public Health ServiceAct. The title of part 1 has also been revised to remove references tospecific statutes enforced by FDA. FDA has determined that this final rule does not change the statutory authorityapplicable to the regulations issued by FDA. In some instances, the agencyis removing references to statutory authority that are inapplicable toany of the sections in that part. In others, the agency is adding referencesto authority that are applicable to one or more sections in that part.Because the changes that the agency is making are not substantive but merelydescribe already applicable authority, the Commissioner of Food and Drugsfinds that there is good cause not to engage in notice and public commentprocedures or to delay the effective date of these amendments. FDA is merelyconforming the form and placement of authority citations to requirementsestablished by the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register in1 CFR 21.40, et al., (5 U.S.C. 553) and correcting inaccuracies in itsregulatory citations. In accordance with 21 CFR 10.40(e)(1), the agency is providing until November27, 1989 for interested persons to submit written comments on the changesto the Dockets Management Branch (address above) to permit the agency todetermine whether any of the provisions of the amendments should subsequentlybe modified or revoked. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted,except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identifiedwith the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4p.m., Monday through Friday. Because the amendments are of a housekeeping nature and are either republicationsor corrections of current citations, the amendments are not subject toExecutive Order 12291.The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a) (8) and (9) that this actionis of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Chapter I of Title 21of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1. The title of part 1 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_GENERAL ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS </ITAG>2. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 1 is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Secs. 4, 5, 6 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act(15 U.S.C. 1453, 1454, 1455); secs. 201, 403, 502, 505, 512, 602, 701 ofthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 343, 352, 355,360b, 362, 371); sec. 215 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 216).</ITAG>3. Section 1.4 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authority citations. </ITAG>(a) For each part of its regulations, the Food and Drug Administrationincludes a centralized citation of all of the statutory provisions thatprovide authority for any regulation that is included in that part. (b) The agency may rely on any one or more of the authorities that arelisted for a particular part in implementing or enforcing any section inthat part. (c) All citations of authority in this chapter will list the applicablesections in the organic statute if the statute is the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the Fair Packagingand Labeling Act. References to an act or a section thereof include referencesto amendments to that act or section. These citations will also list thecorresponding United States Code (U.S.C.) sections. For example, a citationto section 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act would be listed:Sec. 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 371). (d) If the organic statute is one other than those specified in paragraph(c) of this section, the citations of authority in this chapter generallywill list only the applicable U.S.C. sections. For example, a citationto section 552 of the Administrative Procedure Act would be listed: 5 U.S.C.552. The agency may, where it determines that such measures are in theinterest of clarity and public understanding, list the applicable sectionsin the organic statute and the corresponding U.S.C. section in the samemanner set out in paragraph (c) of this section. References to an act ora section thereof include references to amendments to that act or section.(e) Where there is no U.S.C. provision, the agency will include a citationto the U.S. Statutes at Large. Citations to the U.S. Statutes at Largewill refer to volume and page.(f) The authority citations will include a citation to executive delegations(i.e., Executive Orders), if any, necessary to link the statutory authorityto the agency.  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2_GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE RULINGS AND DECISIONS </ITAG>4.
