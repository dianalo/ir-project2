ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's selection of William J.Bennett to head the Republican Party is drawing fire from a civilrights group citing the former Education secretary's opposition toaffirmative action.   ``His department had a woeful record of enforcing the civilrights laws when he was secretary of education,'' said Ralph G.Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on CivilRights.   Bush announced Friday that he would ask the Republican NationalCommittee to elect Bennett its chairman when it convenes inJanuary.   He also announced he was nominating outgoing Florida Gov. BobMartinez to succeed Bennett in the position of director of theOffice of National Drug Control Policy, the nation's so-called drugczar.   Bush described Bennett as ``a man of proven leadership,intellect and commitment whose drive and determination will be atremendous asset to the Republican Party organizations andoperations.''   Neas, however, was sharply critical of Bennett's opposition toaffirmative action as education secretary from 1985 until the finalyear of Ronald Reagan's presidency. He linked Bennett to Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., and Edwin Meese III, who served as attorney generalin the Reagan administration.   Bennett campaigned this fall for Helms in his race forre-election to the Senate from North Carolina. In a close contestwith Democrat Harvey Gantt, who is black, Helms appeared to pullaway after running a commercial that said the Democrat supportedracial quotas that would give jobs to blacks in preference tobetter qualified whites.   ``Mr. Bennett is from the Ed Meese-Jesse Helms wing of theRepublican Party,'' Neas declared.   Bennett would succeed Lee Atwater who has been sidelined by abrain tumor.   Bush said Atwater would assume the role of general chairman, apost that doesn't currently exist.   ``I'm delighted that Lee Atwater will continue to provide valuedcounsel as general chairman of the party,'' said the president.``He has been, as you all know, a close adviser and politicalstrategist - chief political strategist - and a good friend.''   Atwater was manager of Bush's 1988 presidential campaign and isregarded as a master political tactician.   Bennett has no hands-on political experience but is viewed as anarticulate spokesman for conservative views. Friday was Bennett'slast day as head of the government office of drug policy, a post heheld for the first 19 months of the Bush administration.   Republican operatives generally praised the choice of Bennett,particularly his ability to appeal to social and ideologicalconservatives.   ``If there's anything the Republican Party has lacked over thepast year, it's been a voice,'' said Michele Davis, executivedirector of the GOP Governors' Association. ``The base needs to betalked to in pretty plain terms and if there's anything that's aspecialty of Bill Bennett, it's plain speaking.''   The fact that the 47-year-old Bennett was a Democrat until fouryears ago was viewed by some Republicans as a plus.   ``Bill can reinforce the conservative base of the party,'' saidEdward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the House Republican Campaigncommittee. ``He's a convert to Republicanism, so I think it's agreat statement to make to Reagan Democrats.''   Republicans also saw Bennett as a spokesman able to hold his ownin debates with Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown.   Brown said he welcomed the appointment of Bennett.   ``If Bennett accomplishes as much for the Republican Party as heachieved at the Education Department and in ridding us of drugs andviolence, Americans will have to begin worrying about the future ofthe two-party system,'' the Democrat said.   Bush said that in replacing Bennett, he was giving Martinez ``abattlefield promotion for a leader who has earned his stripes onthe front lines of the drug war.''   In his four years as governor, Martinez stressed toughpenalties, law enforcement and prison construction over drugtreatment and prevention. But drug crimes escalated significantlyduring his tenure.   ``He stiffened the Florida code and then added the prison spaceto enforce it.... As a governor who signed more than 130 deathwarrants, he understands tough choices,'' Bush said.   But Martinez' nomination brought criticism from some on CapitolHill that he was not well qualified. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Martinez ``lacksthe background and record'' for the post.   As for Bennett's lack of experience as a political technician,Roger Stone, a Republican consultant, said the new party chairman``is not Lee Atwater.''   ``He can't be Lee Atwater,'' Stone said. ``But if Ron Brownwants to debate affirmative action, I'd have a lot of confidencesending Bill Bennett into that debate.''   As an academic, Bennett wrote extensively in opposition toaffirmative action.   ``Bennett is an intellectual who believes that ideas move theworld,'' said GOP consultant David Keene. ``A lot of politiciansmake the opposite mistake and assume that ideas don't have anyconsequence when in fact they do.''</TEXT></DOC>
