Section 60.13(a)(4) of the program's implementing regulations (42 CFRPart 60, previously 45 CFR Part 126) provides that the Secretary will announcethe interest rate in effect on a quarterly basis.The Secretary announces that for the period ending September 30, 1989,three interest rates are in effect for loans executed through the HealthEducation Assistance Loan (HEAL) program.1. For loans made before January 27, 1981, the variable interest rate is12\1/4\ percent. Using the regulatory formula (45 CFR 126.13(a) (2) and(3)) in effect prior to January 27, 1981, the Secretary would normallycompute the variable rate for this quarter by finding the sum of the fixedannual rate (7 percent) and a variable component calculated by subtracting3.50 percent from the average bond equivalent rate of 91-day U.S. Treasurybills for the preceding calendar quarter (8.73 percent), and rounding theresult (12.23 percent) upward to the nearest \1/8\ percent (12\1/4\ percent).However, the regulatory formula also provides that the annual rate of thevariable interest rate for a 3-month period shall be reduced to the highestone-eighth of 1 percent which would result in an average annual rate inexcess of 12 percent for the 12-month period concluded by those 3 months.Because the average rate of the 4 quarters ending September 30, 1989, isnot in excess of 12 percent, there is no necessity for reducing the interestrate. For the previous 3 quarters the variable interest at the annual ratewas as follows: 10\3/4\ percent for the quarter ending December 31, 1988;11\1/2\ percent for the quarter ending March 31, 1989; and 12\3/8\ percentfor the quarter ending June 30, 1989.2. For variable rate loans executed during the period of January 27, 1981through October 21, 1985, the interest rate is 12\1/4\ percent. Using theregulatory formula (42 CFR 60.13 (a)(3)) in effect for that time period,the Secretary computes the maximum interest rate at the beginning of eachcalendar quarter by determining the average bond equivalent rate for the91-day U.S. Treasury bills during the preceding quarter (8.73 percent);adding 3.50 percent (12.23 percent); and rounding that figure to the nexthigher one-eighth of 1 percent (12\1/4\ percent).3. For fixed rate loans executed during the period of July 1, 1989 throughSeptember 30, 1989, and for variable rate loans executed on or after October22, 1985, the interest rate is 11\3/4\ percent. The Health ProfessionsTraining Assistance Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-129), enacted October 22, 1985,amended the formula for calculating the interest rate by changing 3.5 percentto 3 percent. Using the regulatory formula (42 CFR 60.13(a)(2)), the Secretarycomputes the maximum interest rate at the beginning of each calendar quarterby determining the average bond equivalent rate for the 91-day U.S. Treasurybills during the preceding quarter (8.73 percent); adding 3.0 percent (11.73percent) and rounding that figure to the next higher one-eighth of 1 percent(11\3/4\ percent).<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance No. 13.108, Health EducationAssistance Loans)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
