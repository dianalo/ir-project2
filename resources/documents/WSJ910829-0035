Provincially-owned Hydro-Quebec and the state agency addedthat they may renegotiate terms of the 20-year deal, whichwas to have been signed by Nov. 30, 1991. Under existingterms of the contract, Hydro-Quebec was to deliver 1,000megawatts of electricity to New York beginning in 1995,mainly for use in New York City and Long Island.</LP><TEXT>   Hydro-Quebec said the Quebec government's recent decisionto alter an environmental review of the utility's plannedGreat Whale hydro-electric project also contributed to thedecision to put off signing the NYPA contract. Hydro-Quebecsaid that the new environmental review process will delayconstruction of the Great Whale project. As a result,Hydro-Quebec said it won't have as much electricity availablefor export in 1995 as originally expected.</TEXT></DOC>
