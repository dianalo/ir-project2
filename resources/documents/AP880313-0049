By punching numbers on your phone pad, you will be able toselect the programs you want to watch on cable television, leavemessages for callers when you're not home and, if you have acomputer, tap into a host of databases by dialing just one number.   The seven regional Bell phone companies went to work quickly tomove their plans off the drawing boards when they got a green lightlast week from a federal judge allowing them to offer theseservices to consumers.   Most of the companies say they will begin market trials of someof the services this year and that some services may becomecommercially available in certain areas by year's end, thoughnationwide offering is probably several years away.   Voice mail, which acts like a sophisticated answering machine,is expected to have the most widespread consumer appeal and will beamong the first of the services to hit the commercial market inmost areas.   This service would provide a telephone user with a ``voice mailbox'' in which callers could leave messages when the user's line isbusy or is not answered. The user could retrieve messages at his orher convenience.   ``It's like a mail box, except the letter is by voice,'' saidLinda Laskowski, vice president of the information provider marketfor US West, one of the seven regional Bell companies. ``You canget and receive information but you don't have to be there to doit. What it really stops is telephone tag.''   Users would not have to buy any hardware, like an answeringmachine. With the services, all they would have to do is punchinstructions to the phone company on their phone pad.   Many businesses have this service in their internal phonesystems now, but such private phone systems are not an option formost households or small businesses because of the cost.   The Bell companies say they haven't decided how customers willbe charged for voice mail, but Laskowski said, ``It will have to below enough for the average consumer to want to use it.''   Heidi Harris, director of voice mail for Pacific Bell, suggestedthat ``to send a single message might be within the range of apostage stamp.''   A related service is called voice messaging, which allowscallers to dial a number and reach dozens of recorded messages.Once they've dialed in, a message would tell the callers to punch acertain key to hear the weather report, for example, another keyfor a stock report and another for sports scores. Anotherapplication of this service would allow organizations to leavemessages for members.   Both voice mail and messaging by the Bell companies will competewith answering machines and could shut down many small businessesthat provide live telephone answering services, said Joseph Laseau,executive vice president of the Association of TelemessagingServices International Inc.   ``We see these small businesses losing 10 to 15 percent of theircustomers, and that could put them out of business,'' he said.   The Bell companies also are moving to begin market trials onservices that will make it easier for computer users to sendinformation electronically to other computers and to dial intoinformation databases.   Under U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's order, the companiescan transmit such information services but cannot generate theinformation itself. They will be allowed to function as``gateways,'' providing users with a menu of services they canreach.   Greene is the judge who presides over the breakup of AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which was stripped of its local Belloperating companies four years ago. That led to the formation ofthe seven regional Bell companies.   Dozens of computer information services exist now, but usersmust dial each separately to gain entry. The Bell companies willnow be allowed to provide a single phone number these users candial to reach many databanks.   Companies also will be allowed to enable cable televisionsubscribers to use the touch pad on their phone to tell the cableoperator what channel they want to watch.   Under such a system, subscribers could choose from amongprograms on several channels and pay for what they watch, insteadof subscribing to all the programs on all the channels.   The companies will have to get regulatory approvals for any ofthe services they offer, and in market trials they will be tryingto determine what is easiest for consumers to use.   They also will be trying to develop designs that will becompatible from region to region, so that someone who is accustomedto the voice-mail system in California can make a call in New Yorkand use the same keys for the same functions to store and sendmessages. Compatibility also would allow people to take theircomputer to another region and still be able to connect to localdatabases.   ``There has to be a lot of industry cooperation,'' said GaryHandler, vice president of network planning at Bell CommunicationsResearch, which does research and development for the Bellcompanies. ``Widespread use of these services is going to depend on(common industry) standards.''   Handler said Bellcore is helping the seven companies coordinateon technical standards, but each of the seven is developing its ownproducts.</TEXT></DOC>
