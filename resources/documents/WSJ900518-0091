Doubling the tax to 32 cents a pack would raise about $2.8billion the first year and $13.8 billion over five, theCongressional Budget Office figures. Some Bush advisers thinkanti-smoking sentiment would make the increase easy to sell.Other ideas include a tax on short-term securities trades,new taxes on industrial pollutants and selective increases insome corporate taxes.</LP><TEXT>   Higher gasoline taxes and an oil-import fee have somesupport, but face tough hurdles. A cut in the capital-gainstax is pressed again as a revenue-raiser. Interest groupsfight higher taxes on cigarettes, beer and wine with a studyshowing the poor would be hit hardest. But such items &quot;arethe most vulnerable right now,&quot; says California Rep. Matsui.   Raising tobacco taxes could hurt re-election bids of sometobacco-state lawmakers, such as Kentucky GOP Sen. McConnell.                                                                                                          REARGUARD STRATEGIES at the Pentagon aim to preserve agingweapons.   Rather than oppose administration efforts to kill weapons,the military seeks to retain production options. Armygenerals urge replacing turrets in existing tanks as a way tokeep at least one General Dynamics M-1 tank plant open.Michigan Sen. Levin, usually a defense-spending critic, backsthe Army; one plant is in his state.   The Army also wants to stretch out production of theBradley fighting vehicle, mainly to give FMC Corp. time tofind other Pentagon work. The Air Force tries to protect F-16jets' output by devising new uses, such as providing close-inprotection for infantry troops. Some lawmakers complain aboutmixed Pentagon signals.                                                                                                          BUSH AND QUAYLE are big fund-raisers but have shortpolitical coattails.   Bush raised $24.3 million for the GOP and its candidatesat 22 events last year, plus $21.8 million at 17 events sofar in 1990. This weekend alone he'll hit Texas, Oregon andCalifornia. Quayle travels even more for fund-raisers and hasraised $8.4 million.   But such efforts &quot;haven't given candidates much of a boostat the ballot box,&quot; says Democratic campaign official HowardSchloss. Florida Gov. Martinez still trails for re-election,despite Bush visits. The GOP Senate challenger in Alabamaremains a long shot. Sen. Wilson, running for Californiagovernor, needs help from Bush to improve the GOP'senvironmental image more than he needs money.   Quayle's trip to Texas for GOP gubernatorial candidateWilliams gets mostly bad press about their shared propensityfor verbal gaffes.                                                                                                          VETO BLUFF? The White House informally warns that Bushmight veto the Clean Air bill if the cost to industry exceedscurrent estimates of $21.5 billion a year by 2005. Butpolitical analyst Kevin Phillips says if Bush does so, &quot;he'sgoing to pay a price and Republicans are going to pay a pricewith him&quot; in the elections.                                                                                                          HATCH ACTS to back a candidate for FDA chief. TheRepublican Utah senator pushes a former aide: David Kessler,medical director of the Albert Einstein College of Medicinein New York. Some Democratic congressional staffers also likeKessler, but Bush isn't moving quickly to fill the post.                                                                                                          DRUGS OR OZONE? The U.S. and allies planning July'seconomic summit differ on which other issues to air at theseven-nation meeting in Houston. The Europeans are eager toplay up environmental issues, the U.S. drug-related matters.                                                                                                          HELMS HUNT: Democrats' hopes to beat GOP Sen. Helms inNorth Carolina could sink if front-runner Michael Easley winsa runoff June 5 and his rival, black former Charlotte MayorHarvey Gantt, isn't active in the general election. &quot;But,&quot;says political analyst Charles Cook, &quot;there are harder thingsto do in the world than galvanize blacks against JesseHelms.&quot;                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS FEAR redistricting plans in California wouldcost House seats.   One of two GOP-backed propositions on the June 5 ballotwould require any redistricting plan to be approved bytwo-thirds of the legislature. The other would have changesdone through an independent commission appointed by judges.Either plan, charges state Democratic Chairman Jerry Brown,&quot;gives the Republicans 12 to 15 more seats in Congress.&quot;   Democrats fight back in TV ads with actor Jack Lemmonurging, &quot;Stop the reapportionment fraud.&quot; They say thecommission would be picked by &quot;old white men.&quot; But thepropositions' backers charge in ads that Democrats unfairlyreshaped districts a decade ago. Says Alan Heslop, areapportionment expert who backs the GOP: &quot;The Democratsdeserve to lose at least a half-dozen seats.&quot;   The League of Women Voters, says its Ellen Elliott, backsthe independent body because it would mean &quot;no more districtsthat are contiguous only at low tide.&quot;                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: When Raymond Wittig, a former aide to GOPRep. McDade, was indicted last week, the message on his homephone was: &quot;Wittigs' crisis center. We already have plentybut feel free to add another.&quot; . . . Covering all the bases:At a fund-raising breakfast, Democratic Rep. Murtha satbetween a Georgetown University priest and New York Yankeeowner George Steinbrenner. . . . Asked who at the budgetsummit would be courageous enough to propose new taxes, Sen.Dole replies: &quot;Maybe the custodian.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
