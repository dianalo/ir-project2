 Andcoming into sharper focus is the question of what to do with amultitrillion-dollar investment in second- and third-generationbusiness/financial applications software in an era of fourth-generationtechnology, with the fifth generation in sight.andM;Convert or conserve?andP;  Each option holds some appeal--as well as someperil--for corporate decision-makers.andM;Only a few years ago, IBM shops faced with the problems of migratingobsolescent financial software to fourth-generation data processingenvironments lacked adequate analysis and development tools to execute theconversion cost-effectively.andM;Replacing billions of lines of undecipherable financial source code withfreshly designed, newly written code was scarcely an option for most firms.andO;Among other problems: How would financial management functions be carried outwhile the code was being rewritten?andM;Restructuring unstructed or obsolescent code with computer-aidedrestructuring tools was another option.andP;  But it was only a partial strategy,leaving conversion yet to be done.andP;  Questions of when, how and how much tocommit to the conversion process remained unanswered.andP;  Clairvoyance seemed tobe a more promising alternative than the existing state of the art.andM;Now, however, Case-based application software reengineering has emerged as acredible technology that may offer the best solution.andP;  Reengineering is acost-effective way to efficiently prolong the life cycle of existingfinancial software, or migrate the software so that it can serve moreproductively on different systems.andM;Robert Cawly, partner in the Price Waterhouse Applied Technology Center,Tampa, Fla., views application reengineering as an idea whose time has come.andO;He sees it as the &quot;culmination of an evolution that started at the PC levelseven or eight years ago with systems intregration&quot; and is now an essentialcomponent of application development and maintenance technology.andM;According to Cawly, both the systems integration approach and the latersystem-based application approaches had a vital deficiency: They conformedapplication design and maintenance programming to existing platforms andtheir operating environments, such as MVS or DOS/VSE, rather than to ageneral corporate database supporting the business functions the software wasintended to serve.andP;  This left code utilization vulnerable to theincompatibilities and database redundancies of different systems used withinthe organization.andP;  Placing reverse-engineered code in a common datarepository in a form accessible to any corporate platform or systemenvironment solves that problem, he maintained.andM;Reengineering gives applications software&quot; an elasticity it never hadbefore,&quot; Cawly said.andP;  Common access and new methods of decomposing andreworking old source code enable the code to be used more efficiently in theexisting system or easily migrated to other enviroments.andP;  The reengineeringprocess will also supply essential guidelines for evaluation of all softwaredesigns--old and new--and effective tools for the development of newapplications programs.andM;Precisely what constitutes application reengineering is not universallydefined.andP;  In its narrowest sense, software reengineering--also known asrenovation and reclamation--starts with what in hardware design is known as&quot;reverse engineering.&quot;andP;  Applied to hardware, the process involves determiningthe specifications for an artifact by examining it in progressive stages ofdisassembly, without the benefit of original drawings and documentation.andM;The objective is to learn its design strategy so that the item can beremanufactured.andP;  The action moves from the existing state of implementationback to the underlying design concepts.andM;In the software context, reverse engineering is more broadly defined.andP;  ElliotChikofsky, director of research and technology for Index TechnologyCorporation, Cambridge, Mass., has taught and written on the taxonomy ofreengineering.andP;  According to Chikofsky, &quot;While the hardware objectivetraditionally is to duplicate the system, the software objective is mostoften to gain a sufficient design-level understanding to aid maintenance,strengthen enhancement or support replacement.&quot;andM;These objectives are carried out through the process of &quot;forwardengineering.&quot;andP;  In that process, the development cycle moves from designconcept to implementation by way of enhancement, migration or designdevelopment tools working from a base of new, analytically dissected orrestructured code.andP;  Case technology is employed in both reverse and forwardengineering procedures.andM;In its fullest dimensions, software reengineering is taken to include reverseand forward engineering, plus structured code generation.andP;  Restructuring maybe classified as an allied technology.andP;  (For a complete explanation of thesemantics of reengineering, see page 41, this issue.)andM;If code reusability is accepted as basic to the control of applicationsdevelopment and maintenance costs, then there is no better option thanreengineering, according to Mark Crego, president of InterPort SoftwareCorporation, a software engineering firm in Burke, Va.andP;  &quot;Code doesn't revealits own structures and functions; either someone needs to be around who canexplain them or the knowledge must be electronically extracted.&quot;andM;Crego pointed out that original programmers often are no longer available tofurnish guidance on their design strategy, and &quot;as systems get bigger; noindividual can know enough about the design to be able to supplycomprehensive information.&quot;andP;  Human deductive ability and creative skill,while still major factors in reverse engineering, are time-consuming andprone to error.andP;  Case-based technology combined with expert systems can noweliminate a portion of the former dependence on human experience andtechnical abilities, Crego said.andM;Fundamental to the reengineering process is the creation of an open-ended,object-oriented repository or dictionary that stores component definitionsderived from the original source code.andP;  That information is then accessibleat the graphic interface for user verification and manipulation.andP;  Methodsvary for preparing and populating the repository with structured code andenhancing or migrating it to new platforms via appropriate languageconversions.andM;For example, Price Waterhouse Technologies' Arrae system uses automatedconditioning routines to import and translate process source code intofunctionally categorized component definitions suitable--when placed in the&quot;active component dictionary&quot;--for application enhancement and/or migrationconsistent with user-defined requirements.andM;InterPort Software's InterPort Migration Workbench and InterCase ReverseEngineering Workbench focus on compiler technology that enables Case-driventranslators to analyze and parse code semantically and syntactically in onelanguage and automatically convert it to another.andP;  This allows the code to bemigrated portably from the &quot;structure database repository&quot; to differenthardware and software platforms.andM;Evolve/1, under developmenet by Andersen Consulting, Chicago, as an adjunctto the company's Install/1 and Design/1 toolsets, concentrates on code-levelsemantics in which the system scans an entire mainframe application of Coboland JCL and generates a database that will provide graphic reports inresponse to queries.andM;Design strategies aside, it is pertinent for the systems user to ask ifreengineering is economical.andP;  According to Crego, today's reengineering costsshould be recovered wtihin three to six months.andP;  The payback is in improvedsystem performance, time/space/labor/cost savings and elimination ofredundancies.andP;  He said that reverse engineering should be a onetime cost.andO;Once the original code is effectively reduced to its component definitionsand placed in an open-ended repository, it should be automatically accessiblesystem-wide for unlimited applications use, so long as it is maintained.andM;Robert Lindsey, communications vice president for Viasoft Inc., a Phoenixsoftware firm specializing in software reengineering and testing, said thegreatest impact of reengineering techniques will appear in large enterprises.andO;Banks, insurance companies, investment firms and utilities have huge businessand financial processing requirements with commensurate applicationsmaintenance and development costs, he said.andP;  Even if the big companies usepackaged financial systems as an alternative to customized in-house-generatedsystems, they will frequently have to tailor the packages to theirspecifications.andP;  In addition, they are likely to require major updates toremain current with changing laws, policies and strategic requirements.andP;  Ineither case, there will be significant expenditures on new code andmaintenance, Lindsey said.andM;Among the Fortune 1000 companies, Lindsey said there is growing interest inthe economy and code maintenance discipline of reengineering as well as itsapplication-building flexibility.andM;&quot;How flexible is your software?&quot; asked Stephen Errico, partner in PriceWaterhouse Technologies, a Santa Monica-based software reengineeringconsulting group that works with the Tampa-based Applied Technology Center.andO;If it is not responsive to the information requirements of business, it isnot doing its job, he asserted.andP;  He believes much of the business andfinancial software in existence today is &quot;brittle and unresponsive to change.andM;&quot;I've seen senior execs calling in the CIO and askingfor changes, only to betold OK, but it will take probably three years,&quot; Errico said.andP;  &quot;That's notgood enough for these times.&quot;andP;  Errico said the CIO should be aware of thatreality and the fact that the systems integration approach is not a practicalsolution.andM;Case-based reengineering will answer the corporate need and help to supportthe CIO's role, he said.andP;  But reengineering tools alone cannot accomplishthis.andP;  For the process to achieve its optimum potential, it should be coupledwith a solid understanding of the client's information needs and a closeinteraction with client managers most directly interested in systemsimprovement.andP;  Reengineering of an information system involves nothing lessthan a thorough review of the relevant objectives, priorities and strategicinterests of the company compared to its current levels of informationproductivity.andM;Price Waterhouse's Cawly underscores the idea that corporate management mustlearn how to manage software as an asset and be ready to ascertain its hiddenvalue.andP;  He suggests management should be prepared to evaluate its software asa &quot;competitive weapon in the marketplace.&quot;andP;  Among other tests of value: Couldthe system be acceptably offered to a customer or supplier?andP;  Is thereplacement cost of the system so great that it cannot feasibly be replaced?andM;SOME REENGINEERING SHORTCOMINGSandM;Not every software engineer views the current status of applicationreengineering from the same sanguine perspective.andP;  John Landry, chairman ofAgility Systems, Inc., a Wayland, Mass., software consulting firm, recognizesthe virtues of reengineering.andP;  (As head of development at the formerMcCormack andamp; Dodge, Landry led development of the Millennium series offinancial software applications.)andP;  Landry maintains a cautious view ofreengineering's present capabilities and the promises associated with the newdatabase management systems, fourth-generation languages, LANs, graphicinterfaces and open systems architecture.andM;Despite the heraldry, client/server technology underlying the implementationof distributed and cooperative processing is still in its infancy, Landrymaintained.andP;  He acknowledged that DB2 seems to be developing as a de factoDBMS standard, and he rated SQL as significantly more powerful than any otherdatabase manipulation language.andP;  But while highly portable between mainframeand PC, SQL still lacks portability between mainframe and minicomputerdatabases, and between networked systems.andM;The storage of components and business rules processing data &quot;doesn't belongon workstations; it belongs on servers,&quot; Landry said.andP;  Network problems &quot;arestill there.&quot;andP;  Landry pointed out that there has been little development ongraphic interface/file server architecture and more needs to be done in theshort term to strengthen front-end/back-end communication at the graphicworkstation, supported by more versatile database management.andM;If reengineering is going to be employed, the planning should be timely,appropriate to the corporate context and consistent with known standards,Landry suggested.andP;  In addition, the user should have a clear understandingnot only of what reengineering technology can do at present, but also what itcannot yet offer.andP;  &quot;Data definitions can be converted by automated means;procedural codes must still be converted by hand.&quot;andP;  Software tools &quot;won'ttake you the whole way,&quot; Landry warned.andM;IMPACT ON FINANCIAL PACKAGESandM;The large and growing investment in integrated financial application packagesis a proper consideration for reengineering benefits.andP;  However, informedopinion varies on how reengineering technology will affect users and vendorsof packaged financial software.andM;Price Waterhouse's Cawly says reengineering should help software vendors andclient-based program developers equally to preserve and improve theirsoftware systems.andP;  Packaged financial software has established a clear placefor itself in the business environment.andP;  The aims of the vendors to design,deliver and support the best possible financial packages can only be aided byreengineering techniques, he suggested.andM;Howard Smith agrees.andP;  Smith, president of Beverly Hills-based SoftwareLeasing Corp., was on the starting team at MSA, Inc., now merged withMcCormack andamp; Dodge, and operating as Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software.andO;&quot;Reengineering is a permanent part of application software design andmaintenance,&quot; he said.andP;  It offers vendor and user a fast, economical new wayto write new applications while saving perhaps 80% of the old code.andM;Reengineering &quot;won't slow down the package market,&quot; Smith said.andP;  The utilityof packaged software is an acknowledged fact.andP;  Demand should remain strong,even though reengineering techniques may make it easier for users to developand support their own financial software.andM;Smith cautioned, however, that the user should know the nature of thesoftware engineering approach and its limitations before making decisions.andO;He perceives vendors such as Andersen Consulting, Bachman InformationSystems, Cambridge Mass., Index Technology and Knowledge-Ware, Atlanta, ashaving a forward engineering thrust optimally oriented to applicationdevelopment.andP;  Price Waterhouse's approach, while offering forward and reverseengineering, emphasizes system conservation as a major focus in the contextof redesign considerations, Smith said.andM;MIS must be responsive to more &quot;boardroom demands for information technology,especially executive information and decision support systems,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Yet most companies don't want radical changes in their financialprocedures.&quot;andP;  Smith argues for a comprehensive assessment of administrativeand strategic needs versus technology before management makes commitments toreengineering.andM;REENGINEERING OPPORTUNITIESandM;Landry believes reengineering will offer &quot;wonderful opportunites&quot; for newer,smaller package vendors, who still have the flexibility to experiment withsoftware designs.andP;  He thinks the bigger vendors, with long-term investmentsin their systems and large customer bases to support, are less likely topursue major applications changes on a short-term basis.andP;  Considering therevenues obtained from support services, the bigger vendors may not be asinclined to encourage their customers to pursue maintenance and developmentneeds independently with the tools that Case-based reengineering nowprovides.andM;Viasoft's Lindsey holds that financial package users with large and complexfinancial systems will lean toward reengineering as a way to keepapplications development current with changing laws, currencies, financialmanagement projects, personnel tracking and myriad other corporateinformation requirement.andM;If the package vendors do not supply efficient application-building andmaintenance tools, the companies will provide for themselves.andP;  He infers thatthere may be an opportunity for the package vendors to seize the initiativethat reengineering offers by using it to generate product improvements infaster cycles.andM;Eric Bush, chairman of Language Technology Inc., a Salem, Mass., softwarefirm specializing in software restructuring, believes that all of the packagevendors can benefit from an analysis of &quot;exactly how good their software is.&quot;andO;He states that he has seen &quot;some of the worst code going&quot; on financialsoftware packages.andP;  Whether the correctional task can be effectively managedby code restructuring or will require reverse engineering, may be debatable,but not the need for code improvement, Bush suggested.andM;Maintenance support offered by major financial software vendors in someinstances has not permitted changes in source code, except on a line-by-linebasis, Bush said.andP;  The expense and inconvenience were likely to discourageusers from making any significant changes as a result.andP;  Imposed use of thesame code &quot;has been a millstone,&quot; Bush charged.andM;THE NEED TO REFINEandM;Until the day business procedures are completely standardized, or until auniversal language replaces Cobol, C and other languages, or until there areuniversal standards for database management and interplatform communication,the need to review, refine and convert code will be an important function inIS technology, Bush said He intimates that every software vendor should beready to appreciate that proposition.andM;David Sharon, president of Case Associates, Inc., an Oregon City, Ore.,andO;consulting firm specializing in Case as part of athree-firm consortium, seesa shift in perspective beginning to form among the package software vendors.andO;He said &quot;software companies--Walker Interactive Systems and TeseractCorporation [both in San Francisco], for example--are getting away fromselling code and applications packages.&quot;andP;  They are taking the position thateach customer has a &quot;somewhat unique set of needs that resist the rigiditiesof packaged systems.&quot;andM;To satisfy the need for customization, vendors are starting to build intotheir packages application-change programs that subject feeder systems andoutput material to a continuous process of evolution.andP;  Sharon speculated thatin two or three years software vendors will be selling PC-based design guidesand design repositories.andP;  These toolsets will provide an application baseoffering maximum design flexibility to the user for in-house applicationsdevelopment and maintenance program design.andM;HOW PACKAGE VENDORS SEE ITandM;Dennis Vohs, on the management team at MSA before becoming the chiefexecutive at Ross Systems Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., acknowledged the value ofreengineering.andP;  He put it in the perspective of competition between the IBMworld and the DEC world.andP;  &quot;Yes, we're hot on reengineering and we've beenusing it,&quot; he said, &quot;but not for redesign of our systems architecture.&quot;andM;Vohs argues that the rush to reengineer applications software has been led bythe IBM users in high anxiety to become SAA-compliant, lest they be leftbehind in the race to keep their business systems competitive.andP;  He reasons ifIBM had followed Digital's lead in developing an integrated computingenvironment similar to VAX, the need to convert systems would not be such anissue for IBM users.andP;  IBM-based financial packages will need a great deal ofreengineering to bring them into compliance with SAA.andP;  And that is not likelyto happen for seven or eight years, Vohs predicted.andM;Vohs cited the relative ease with which Ross Systems has been able to evolveits Renaissance family of financial software in accordance with Digital's RMSdatabase environment and plan for smooth transitions to Digital's CompundDocument Architecture and VAX Rdb/VMS environments as standards crystallize.andO;by contrast, he said, getting online with DB2 has been much more of a problemfor IBM-based financial package users, to say nothing of the delays anddifficulties ahead in the process of upgrading to AD/Cycle.andM;Reengineering may be the best solution available to IBM users, but, saidVohs, it is no compensation for the fix they are in or for the price theywill have to pay to out out of it.andM;George Van Schaick, marketing vice president for Computer Associates'Information Management Software division, Garden City, N.Y., asks, &quot;What'sall this reengineering hoopla all about?&quot;andP;  Financial applications last a longtime, he said.andP;  Many applications developed 10-15 years ago are still runningand doing their job on acceptable budgets.andP;  Of course, it is important toreview and maintain program efficiency, Van Schaick said.andP;  But he warned thatradical changes in financial systems may do more harm than good.andM;IS IT COST-EFFECTIVE?andM;Van Schaick also questioned whether the effort to save or streamline codewill be cost-effective.andP;  He pointed out that the task of deciphering thefunctional rationale of long-standing code is still highly labor-intensiveand can easily cost more than it is worth.andM;The overriding IS concern today is not keeping abreast of technology, butreducing the applicatins backlog in a timely and sensible way, Van Schaicksaid.andP;  That means essentially freeing the MIS people to write new code, notto reengineer the old.andM;Most businesses do not need the most advanced technology, even if it wereimmediately available, said Van Schaick.andP;  It is far more important for themto leverage their resources so that they can continue to get cost-effectiveuse of the systems they have.andP;  Reengineering will help on the maintenanceside, but not for systems conversion--not yet.andM;Until it becomes feasible to plan compliance with IBM's new standards, CA'sstrategy for its IBM mainframe-based Masterpiece financial software will beto make it as flexible as possible in addressing multiple databaseenvironments--with provision for DB2, AD/Cycle and SAA in due time.andP;  &quot;Ourobject is to make the systems of the present work,&quot; Van Schaick said.andO;&quot;Seventy percent of my time is spent on solutions that maintain ourcustomers' existing systems.&quot;andM;Hank Holland, executive vice president of development and customer servicesfor Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software, Natick, Mass., said he became aware ofreengineering technology two or three years ago and employed it sporadicallyin individual applications.andP;  He believes that there is a valid place forreengineering in his company's Randamp;D and customer support operations.andP;  &quot;We mustbe prepared to retool and reengineering new products in response to customerdemand.&quot;andM;Reengineering tools may give his customers some measure of vendorindependence, but it is not likely to undermine the position of the packagesoftware developer, Holland said.andP;  There will always be a need forcustom-designed and custom-reengineered financial products that will excludethe package vendor.andP;  Order processing and customer service are examples.andO;Holland sees his job as using reengineering techniques where they will do hiscompany and its customers the most good.andM;Preparing the company's IBM mainframe-based financial products for theevolution to SAA is not Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software's most pressing problem atthe moment.andP;  Coordinating technological strategy and marketing policiesresulting from last year's merger between McCormack andamp; Dodge and MSA &quot;is JobOne,&quot; said Holland.andM;&quot;Reengineering is no threat to us,&quot; said Rick Marquardt, marketing vicepresident of Walker Interactive Systems.andP;  There is still a need for packagedsolutions, he maintained.andP;  Any effective means of helping to upgrade Walker'sIBM mainframe-based, packaged financial systems to the benefit of Walker'scustomers is to Walker's benefit too, he said.andM;The company's immediate objective is to bring customers with disparatedatabase management systems on-line with DB2 technology now built intoWalker's financial packages.andP;  Reengineering can play an important part inthat aim, Marquardt said.andM;&quot;Walker is selling the DB2 environment.&quot;andP;  If the customer can leverageapplications benefits outside of Walker's software, &quot;that's fine with us,&quot;said Marquardt.andP;  He now sees use of reengineering tools explanding as Walkermoves toward SAA compliance.andM;Interport's Crego envisions the day when every MIS installation of any sizehas a reengineering group with freedom to concentrate exclusively onreengineering applicatins.andP;  It will be a small, dedicated group of softwarespecialists and business analysts.andP;  But the magnitude of its value will bedisproportionate to its size.andP;  That day may be coming soon.andM;Tobias is a freelance writer based in Port Washington, N.Y.andP;  He focuses onthe application of computer technology to economic development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
