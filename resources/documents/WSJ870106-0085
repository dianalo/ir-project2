The Kremlin yesterday said publicly for the first time that foreign companies wishing to have their satellites launched on Soviet carrier rockets could ship them into the country in sealed containers without inspection by Soviet customs officials.    Western sources said the announcement, by Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov in an interview with the official news agency Tass, was aimed at allaying concerns over possible Soviet espionage and illegal tranfers of advanced Western technology.    Mr. Ryzhkov also said clients' technicians would be permitted to escort the satellites to the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site in Central Asia and to integrate their payloads with the Soviet Proton launcher, the 22-year-old workhorse booster of the Soviet manned and unmanned space programs.    &quot;The Soviets have already made these pledges secretly to potential clients,&quot; said Chester Lee, director of customer services of the U.S. space agency's Office of Space Flight. &quot;By going public, they hope to boost what so far has been an unsuccessful sales campaign conducted mostly in private.&quot;    To sweeten the terms for foreign customers, Mr. Ryzhkov said the Soviet Union would offer flight insurance, though he gave no details. In the past, prospective clients were told they would have to raise satellite insurance on the open market. Mr. Ryzhkov also indicated that Moscow's already cut-rate fees would be lowered further, and he repeated the offer of substantial discounts for Third World nations.    Officials of the U.S. space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the Soviets have won only one launch contract -- from India -- since a civil space agency, the Moscow-based Glavkosmos, was formed in late 1985 to oversee the marketing effort. Soviet officials concede they have been unable to pick up any of the launch backlog since explosions grounded NASA's space shuttle and the European Space Agency's Ariane program last year.    Experts said the Soviet Union is aiming mostly at the European market and at international communications organizations. New urgency has been added to the Soviet sales push under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of maximizing all sources of foreign exchange to help his economic modernization program.    One of the main obstacles Glavkosmos has faced comes from export-control laws under an agreement by the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, prohibiting satellites made with U.S. parts from being shipped to communist countries. Most of the world's satellites contain some U.S. hardware.    One senior U.S. Defense Department official saw Mr. Ryzhkov's announcement partly as a tactic to erode U.S. influence over its allies.    &quot;By having the Soviet prime minister state publicly that payloads will have a sort of diplomatic immunity on Soviet soil, the Russians hope to pressure us into allowing our allies to use their launch services,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole campaign blows neatly with their objective of driving a wedge between us and our allies.&quot;    John Koehler, president of Hughes Communications Inc., Los Angeles, said: &quot;The Soviets would like to make it as difficult as possible for the U.S. to complain about future West European firms that want to use the Proton launcher.&quot;    Soviet officials have alleged U.S. interference in Moscow's marketing effort, including the first Soviet attempt to sell satellite launch services in July 1985. At that time, the International Maritime Satellite Organization, or Inmarsat, decided it would be more expeditious to choose the shuttle and the Ariane for its next three launches -- even though the Russian bid was lower.    &quot;The U.S. stand in relation to the Soviet Proton rocket, which was suggested as a carrier for Inmarsat's ship-to-shore communications network, can serve as a classic example of bias,&quot; Stepan Bogodyazh, International Liaison Department chief of Glavkosmos, told a Moscow newspaper. &quot;The American side has been doing all it can to exclude the Soviet Proton from the list of contenders in this field.&quot;    A launch on a Soviet Proton rocket costs between $18 million and $20 million for a medium-size satellite, about half the current rate for Europe's Ariane. The Soviet program is fully operational, with about 100 launches a year. </TEXT></DOC>
