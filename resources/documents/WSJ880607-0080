LaRue was taken over by the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. Friday. Cumberland acquired the insured deposits from the FSLIC. Cumberland said it decided to pay an estimated $48,000 of uninsured deposits that weren't covered by collateral, so no depositor will lose as a result of the LaRue takeover.    Cumberland Federal, which has assets of $1.1 billion, operates 30 offices in 10 Kentucky cities. </TEXT></DOC>
