Mossberg   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/14/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)</IN><GV>DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The timing couldn't have been much worse. Onthe very day that Iraq invaded Kuwait, President Bushannounced plans to drastically reduce the size of the U.S.military.   Now, hardliners inside and outside the Pentagon aredemanding that the president think again. Plans to cut themilitary, they contend, could make the Gulf victoryimpossible to repeat. Warned Henry Kissinger in a Feb. 26Washington Post piece: &quot;Had Kuwait been invaded two yearslater, the American defense budget would have declined so asto preclude a massive overseas deployment.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But one obvious fact gets little notice in the reneweddebate: Even the slimmed-down U.S. military currently plannedfor 1995 would remain an awesomely huge force, able to deployjust as many planes, ships, tanks and troops as the U.S. sentto the Gulf -- with units left to spare.   &quot;We could have taken care of Iraq with the scaled-downforce,&quot; says Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee's manpower subcommittee. AddsSam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee:&quot;Done properly, I think the new, smaller force structurewould be able to handle something like Desert Storm in themid-1990's.&quot;   Most senior Pentagon officials also say that even atreduced levels, the U.S. would have a lopsidedly large forceto field against any foreseeable Third World threat. In fact,a rerun of Operation Desert Storm would consume only half --possibly fewer -- of the Army divisions, Navy aircraftcarriers and Air Force fighter wings that the Pentagon plansto have in 1995.   As it was, the Army committed about eight divisions in thewar against Iraq -- fewer than a third of its current totalof 28, including reserves, and fewer than half of its totalof 18 active-duty divisions. The Navy sent just six of its 13aircraft-carrier battle groups. The Air Force contributed theequivalent of 10 tactical fighter wings, fewer than a thirdof its total of 36 wings and fewer than half of the 24active-duty wings. U.S. troops represented 85% of the alliedcombat forces in the war.   &quot;I am comfortable with the capabilities that these forceswill possess,&quot; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress inthe midst of the Desert Storm fighting. Unless there is areversal of the military pullback by the Soviet Union, headded, the smaller U.S. armed forces of the future will be&quot;prudently matched to the threat we have been projecting.&quot;   The cutback program that the president announced last Aug.2, devised by Secretary Cheney and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.Colin Powell, would slash total U.S. troop strength 25% toroughly 1.7 million active-duty personnel by late 1995 andwould halt further production of a number of weapons thatbecame prime-time stars in the Gulf drama: the F-16 Fighter,the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the M1A1 tank, for instance.   Even if the lessons of Desert Storm don't fundamentallychange the cutback plan, they will alter it in some details.Because so many U.S. troops are still in the war zone,Congress has excused the Army from making the force cuts itwas slated to make this year. And the Army wants another yearstill to reach its final, lower troop level -- to avoid toomuch &quot;turbulence&quot; in the ranks. There will also be support inCongress to continue some canceled weapons.   But the severe downsizing remains mostly on track -- tothe consternation of many military experts. On Feb. 28, theday the war ended, military analyst Anthony Cordesmanexpressed concerns that under the Cheney plan, &quot;many of ourtechnological assets will be gone -- perhaps much of ourreadiness as well.&quot; He wrote in the New York Times: &quot;If thisgoes on, we will be unable to refight our last war, much lessthe next one. Any effort to check future aggression will bethreatened.&quot;   And although top commanders remain committed to thecutbacks, there's still plenty of dissent inside thePentagon. Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, hastaken pains to warn Congress of the risks, even though heofficially backs the plan. &quot;The army of the mid-1990's,&quot; hesays, &quot;will be a perilously small land force for a nationwith the United States' superpower responsibilities.&quot;   In fact, many agree that the U.S. shouldn't make thisyear's Persian Gulf conflict the high-water mark in planningfor the enemy armies of the future. Desert Storm wasperfectly timed for the U.S. It occurred when the U.S. stillhad a large military designed to fight the U.S.S.R., but at atime when the actual threat from the Soviets had receded toalmost nil. It was a war fought in wide-open spaces againstSoviet weapons and tactics -- the very fight the U.S. spentyears preparing to win.   By contrast, what if the U.S. were forced to fight inmultiple theaters? In jungles? What if nuclear weapons becameinvolved? What if the Soviet threat reappeared?   &quot;People can cite every contingency in the world,&quot; saysSen. Glenn, &quot;but you can't provide permanently for World WarIII. You've got to make some judgments about what the realthreats will be.&quot;   Pentagon planners are hoping that while the new militarywill be smaller, it also will be more effective, particularlyagainst a greater number of Third World threats. With fewerunits -- and with more based in the U.S. -- it will becrucial to have enough transport planes and ships to rushtroops to a distant war. One weapon conspicuously spared theknife was the new C-17 transport plane.   In addition, Mr. Cheney may soon announce a plan for fast,new cargo ships and other moves to increase sealift, usingextra funds Congress has already appropriated. The defensechief has already announced plans to boost by more than 50%the reserve fleet of mothballed ships he can tap in wartime.   The cutback plan also contemplates plowing back trainingfunds, saved by paring troop numbers, into increasing thereadiness of the smaller forces that remain. For instance,the plan foresees maintaining the current number of flyinghours, Navy steaming days and Army ground miles now spent intraining, despite the cutbacks in personnel. The prospect ofmoderate oil prices in the next few years should help makethat possible.   The downsizing plan contemplates maintaining, or evenincreasing, spending for research and development on newweapons while procurement is slowed.   So even before receiving final reports on the Persian Gulfwar, military leaders are convinced that changes to thedownsizing plan will be slight. &quot;This force,&quot; Adm. DavidJeremiah, deputy to Gen. Powell, told lawmakers this week,&quot;has the capability of doing it.&quot;   ---                       Lean But Mean                                                                                                          Defense Secretary Cheney plans major cuts in the number ofU.S. military units by 1995 now that the Soviet threat isreceding. But even the smaller military he plans wouldcontain at least twice as many of these major units than wereused in the Gulf war.
