(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan today signed landmarktrade legislation and told an audience at this bustling West Coastport the new law will keep America riding on a ``global wae'' ofprosperity.   He said he was signing the bill despite misgivings over some ofits provisions.   ``We're here to sign a piece of legislation that will help oureconomy continue to grow and compete,'' Reagan said in remarksprepared for a signing ceremony at the Port of Long Beach, one ofthe world's 10 busiest computerized cargo ports.   Port officials say 60.6 million metric tons of cargo crossedLong Beach piers last year, the most ever recorded at a West Coastport.   The legislation authorizes U.S. participation in current worldtrade talks, streamlines procedures for retaliatory import curbsagainst unfair trade practices and makes many other changes intrade laws.   ``Our administration and Congress have come together in aneffort to ensure open markets around the world,'' Reagan said. ``Ithasn't been easy, but I have never doubted our ultimate victory,because we're riding a global wave.   ``Country after country is recognizing that free trade is thekey to a more prosperous future and that protectionism protects noone, not even the special interests that want it so much.''   Reagan, who had objected to what he said were protectionistfeatures in earlier versions of the legislation, said there arestill ``some things in this bill I don't like.''   He said the law could lead to an import fee that would beillegal under international law and ``inconsistent with our goal ofmoving toward free world trade.''   He said the bill also appears to require exeutive branchofficers to negotiate with foreign countries on specified tradetopics, which he argued is ``inconsistent with our constitutionalprinciples.''   He also objected that the bill purports to require theInternational Trade Commission to conduct investigations inresponse to a resolution passed by just one House or Senatecommittee.   ``And so, in signing this bill I am specifically noting that itwill be implemented in a constitutional manner,'' the presidentsaid.   The signing climaxes months of negotiation between theadministration and Congress over the bill, which Reagan vetoed whenit was first sent to him because it contained a provision requiringa 60-day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs.   Congress, however, promptly passed the advance-notice provisionas a separate bill, and Reagan _ trying to minimize its importanceas a Democratic election-year issue _ then let it become lawwithout his signature.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas and his party's vice presidentialcandidate, said over the weekend that the administration hadresisted the plan ``every inch of the way.''   Bentsen, the Texas senator who was the bill's prime sponsor,said in a radio speech that ``this administration has been areluctant partner. They have clung stubbornly to the status quo,ignored the mounting deficits and resisted a trade policy everyinch of the way.''   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked whether Bentsen'skey role on the bill put the president in an awkward position,replied, ``Bentsen did a good job on this. He worked on it a lot ofyears and so did we. And everybody who worked on it gets credit.''   The bill authorizes U.S. negotiators to reach agreements ininternational trade talks, streamlines the system of import curbsto protect American business and provides for retraining of thoseleft jobless by foreign competition. It also contains a potential$2.5 billion in export subsidies for agricultural products andrepeals the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry earnings,which has not produced any revenue since oil prices plunged threeyears ago.   Another provision allows the United States to retaliate againstcountries that do not abide by international agreements on workers'rights. AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said Monday he would askthe administration to invoke this provision against Poland, wherethe government ordered troops to secure major industrial plants andclamped curfews on three provinces hit by strikes in favor of theoutlawed union movement Solidarity.   From Long Beach, the president was going to Irvine to speak to acrowd expected to number 800 to 900 at a $500-a-plate fund-raisingluncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.   While in Los Angeles, the president plans to have privatedinners with old friends and see his eye doctor and ear, nose andthroat specialist, as he does annually during his late-summerCalifornia vacation.   First lady Nancy Reagan's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, saidMrs. Reagan would pay a call on decorators at the home in the BelAir section of Los Angeles where the Reagans plan to live after heleaves office Jan. 20.</TEXT></DOC>
