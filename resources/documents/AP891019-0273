GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forty years after nuclear wastes werefirst dumped into the soil of the Hanford nuclear reservation, thegovernment is starting to look at just what's brewing under thesurface.   The ambitious new Molecular Science Research Centeris a symbolof the U.S. Department of Energy's committment to cleaning up afterproduction of nuclear weapons at 17 plants around the country, saidMichael Knotek, who left the Brookhaven National Laboratory tobecome the center's manager.   The total cost of the cleanup has been estimated at $90 billionto $150 billion. ``The country can't afford that,'' said Knotek,noting that one major mission will be to find technology to reducethose costs. ``We've got to find a permanent solution. One we canafford and everybody will be happy with.''   When it is completed, it will be the only U.S. facilitydedicated to molecular science research, the study of molecules andhow they combine to form structures. Such work is currentlydistributed across the country, and the only comparable facility isin Okazaki, Japan, Knotek said.   The MSRC takes molecular research out of a closed setting like auniversity and into the front line, said Steven Colson, who washired from Yale University to be an associate director. ``We'rehere on top of a major environmental problem. You don't find thatat a university.''   The center is expected to focus on problems of cleaning up theHanford site. Since 1943, Hanford has produced much of theplutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal; it's the EnergyDepartment's most polluted site with more than half of the nation'sdefense wastes. Much of that waste in the past was dumped directlyinto the soil.   What it has been doing underground is not known, said DonFriedrich, who is using lasers to study the reactions of chemicalsthat exist underground. Wastes that could be relatively benignalone can combine with others, or with elements in the soil, tobecome very dangerous; on the other hand, the danger from somewastes could be reduced by molecular conversion occurringunderground.   The laser research is designed to give a sort of undergroundweather map of the Hanford site, he said. It will help scientistspredict how the wastes are changing, in which direction they aretraveling, and how fast.   Friedrich is one of about 10 researchers and staff alreadyworking at the center, which is operating on a $6 million 1990budget and has headquarters at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory runby Battelle. When a $135 million building is completed by themid-1990s, it will have 200 full-time staffers, plus 30 to 50visiting scientists, and an annual budget of $40 million.   That is a drop in the bucket compared to the $385 million annualbudget and 6,300 jobs tied to the production of plutonium forweapons at Hanford in recent years. Plutonium production hasalready been sharply curtailed and is expected to be phased outcompletely by the mid-1990s.   Washington state politicians, especially those opposed tonuclear production at Hanford, have repeatedly argued that wastecleanup represents the best economic future for the site and theadjacent Tri-Cities.   The MSRC and a companion Environmental Center of Excellence,which will field-test different clean-up proposals, are thecornerstone of a plan to turn Hanford into the nation's leadingnuclear cleanup research center.   But it is extremely unlikely the waste research can ever providethe level of jobs that defense production did, Knotek said.   Hanford is a good choice for the MSRC because it is next to thebulk of the nation's defense wastes where ``we will never be ableto forget it,'' and because of the Northwest's strong environmentalinterest, he said.   Knotek considers environmental cleanup a more pressing goal thanthe space race set off in the 1950s by the Soviet Sputnik launch.Sputnik was an implied threat to national security, while nuclearwaste is a real physical problem.   That should lead to an increase in federal funding forenvironmental science research, with a corresponding increase injobs for researchers, he said. ``Research follows needs. It's assimple as that.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Oct. 23</NOTE></DOC>
