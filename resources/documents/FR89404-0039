The assessment provides a basis for the conclusionthat the field testing of these genetically engineered tomato plants willnot present a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest andwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. Sivramiah Shantharam, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 841, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-5940.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. APHIS has stated that it would preparean environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impactstatement before issuing a permit for the release into the environmentof a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). Monsanto Agricultural Company of Chesterfield, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment, to fieldtest genetically engineered tomato plants modified to express the delta-endotoxingene. The delta-endotoxin gene was derived from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis. </T3>In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. An insecticidal gene from <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>has been inserted into tomato chromosome in a way thatwould allow the production of delta-endotoxin. In nature, genetic materialcontained in a chromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatibleplant by cross-pollination and fertilization. In this field trial the introducedgenes cannot spread to another plant by cross-pollination, because thefield test plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexually compatibleplants with which these experimental tomato plants could cross-pollinate.2. Neither the delta-endotoxin gene nor its polypeptide product conferson tomato any plant pest characteristics. <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>from which the delta-endotoxin gene was obtained is alsonot a plant pest. 3. The delta-endotoxin gene does not provide the transformed tomato plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomato plantsin its ability to be dispersed or to become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the delta-endotoxin gene to tomato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid with known plant pathogenicpotential, has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicityhave been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shownto be nonpathogenic to susceptible plants. 5. The vector agent used to deliver the chimeric vector DNA containingthe delta-endotoxin gene into the tomato plant cells is <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens. </T3>The bacterial vector agent was eliminatedby the use of appropriate antibacterial antibiotics. 6. Horizontal movement of the stably integrated deltaendotoxin gene intoa plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. The vectorsimply delivers and inserts the gene into the tomato genome. The vectordoes not survive in or on any of the transformed plants. There has beenno demonstration of a mechanism in nature to move an inserted gene froma chromosome of a transformed plant to any other organism. 7. The size of the field test plot is small (0.5 acre with 1,350 transgenicplants, 250 nontransgenic plants, and up to 500 plants in the border rows)and will be located at a distance of 30 feet from other commercial andbreeding tomatoes on a private farm. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500 1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part lb), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384 and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 29th day of March 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
