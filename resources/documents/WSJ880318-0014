Robert White, the union president, said he expects 5,000 striking union members at five Northern Telecom plants in Canada to vote this weekend on the proposed pact. If approved, he said workers could be back at their jobs Monday.    Northern Telecom, a telecommunications equipment maker, said it has been able to meet orders during the strike by shipping products from inventory. &quot;The company didn't suffer,&quot; said John Rankin, vice president, human resources. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Northern Telecom stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $19.625 a share.    Under terms of the tentative contract, Northern Telecom agreed to the union's chief demand of inflation-indexed pension payments to future retirees. The company said it would also later grant similar payments to current retirees. The proposed indexing formula would limit annual pension increases to 6%, the union said.    The proposed pact also provides average annual wage increases for hourly production workers of 5% to 6%, said Mr. Rankin. &quot;It's a good offer in these days of low inflation,&quot; he said. The union's previous pact expired Feb. 28, the day before the strike began.    The union said the proposed wage gain, combined with increases in cost-of-living adjustments, would raise the average hourly pay of Northern Telecom production workers to 17.80 Canadian dollars ($14.23) or more by the end of the tentative pact, from about 15.23 Canadian dollars currently. Skilled trades workers would receive slightly higher gains, the union said.    Neither Mr. White nor Mr. Rankin would estimate the total cost of the package or the pension indexing formula to Northern Telecom. The proposed pact &quot;is generous, but it doesn't hurt us competitively,&quot; Mr. Rankin said.    Northern Telecom's contracts with several other Canadian unions, which collectively represent about 5,000 additional workers, are also due to be renegotiated this year, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
