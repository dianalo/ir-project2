Subsequently, the petitionwas amended to request the use of dimethyl dicarbonate to prevent the growthof yeasts in wines only. Dimethyl dicarbonate is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almostimmediately after addition to beverages. In wine and aqueous liquids, theprincipal breakdown products are methanol and carbon dioxide. Dimethylcarbonate and methylethl carbonate, as well as carbomethoxy amino and hydroxyadducts of amines, sugars, and fruit acids, are also formed in minor amounts.Dimethyl dicarbonate also may react with traces of ammonia or ammoniumions in wines to form trace quantities of methyl carbamate. Methyl carbamatehas been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. In accordance with 21 CFR 171.1, FDA has reviewed the safety of the foodadditive dimethyl dicarbonate, as well as that of the by-products formedduring hydrolysis and reaction of the food additive with other constituentsfound in wines. The results of that review are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety </ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. Under section 409(c)(5)(A) of the act(21 U.S.C. 348(c)(5)(A)), in determining whether a proposed use of a foodadditive is safe, among the relevant factors to be considered is the probableconsumption of the additive and of any substance formed in or on food becauseof the use of the additive. The concept of safety embodied in the FoodAdditives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative history ofthe provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonble certainty that noharm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_andcannot_require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2nd Sess.4 (1958)). This concept of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C.348(c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shall be deemed tobe safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal.In the past, FDA often refused to approve a use of an additive that containedeven minor amounts of a carcinogenic chemical, even though the additiveas a whole had not been shown to cause cancer. The agency now believesthat the Delaney or anticancer clause is applicable only when the foodadditive as a whole is found to cause cancer. An additive that has notbeen shown to cause cancer but that contains a carcinogenic constituent,or whose use will lead to the formation of trace amounts of a carcinogenicsubstance in or on food, may be properly evaluated under the general safetyclause of the statute.\1\<NOTE/> Risk assessment procedures are used to determine whetherthere is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposeduse of the additive. Developments in scientific technology and experiencewith risk assessment procedures make it possible for FDA to establish thesafety of such additives. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ However, the statute calls for a different treatment fromcompounds whose use as a food additive, color additive, or new animal drugadministered to food-producing animals results in the formation of carcinogenicmetabolites in the animal. Such compounds and their metabolites are subjectto the relevant Delaney Clause and DES proviso (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)(food additives); 376(b)(5)(B) (color additives); 360b(d)(1)(H)(ii) (newanimal drugs)); as well as the general safety clause. See the Commissioner'sdecision on the withdrawal of approval of new animal drug applicationsfor diethylstilbestrol (44 FR 54852 at 54868-54869; September 21, 1979).The agency's position on additives that contain a carcinogenic constituentbut that have themselves not been shown to cause cancer is supported by<T3> Scott</T3> v.<T3> FDA</T3>, 728 F. 2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list the abovecolor additive, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitrejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.The agency believes that it is consistent with the<T3> Scott</T3> decision to interpret the constituents policy to includethe current situation, which relates to the possible formation of traceamounts of a carcinogenic substance from the use of a food additive infood but in which the additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use of Dimethyl Dicarbonate</ITAG>FDA finds that the petitioned use level of 100 to 200 parts per million(ppm) of dimethyl dicarbonate will result in virtually no exposure of consumersto the additive itself. Dimethyl dicarbonate is unstable in aqueous solutionand breaks down almost immediately after addition to the food (beverages)to form primarily carbon dioxide and methanol. The instability of dimethyldicarbonate is confirmed by data submitted by the petitioner showing thatdimethyl dicarbonate cannot be detected by analysis of food to which ithas been added.To establish that dimethyl dicarbonate is safe for use as an inhibitorof yeast in wine, the petitioner submitted data from acute, subchronic,and chronic toxicity studies. In the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies,rats received either water, orange juice, or wine treated with 4,000 (ppm)of dimethyl dicarbonate (20 times the proposed use level in wine) as thedrinking fluid while the controls received water, orange juice, or wine.These studies revealed no adverse effects from water, orange juice, orwine treated with dimethyl dicarbonate.In other chronic toxicity studies, dogs received either water or orangejuice treated with 4,000 ppm of dimethyl dicarbonate as the drinking fluid.These studies also revealed no adverse effects from the water or orangejuice treated with dimethyl dicarbonate.The petitioner also submitted a 2-generation rat study in which rats receiveddrinking fluids that were treated with dimethyl dicarbonate (4,000 ppm).This study revealed no adverse effects. These chronic and multigenerationstudies of dimethyl dicarbonate did not produce any evidence that it isa carcinogen.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Safety of Substances That May be Present in Wine Due to Use ofthe Additive</ITAG>Because dimethyl dicarbonate decomposes into other chemical species whenadded to aqueous solutions such as wine, FDA has also evaluated the safetyof the chemicals formed as a result of the addition of dimethyl dicarbonateto wine.A. Minor Reaction ProductsThe minor reaction products formed in wine from the use of dimethyl dicarbonateinclude methylethyl carbonate and carbomethoxy amino- and hydroxy-adductsof amines, sugars, and naturally occurring fruit acids such as lactic acid,citric acid, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Dimethyl carbonate, an impurityin dimethyl dicarbonate, is also found in wine in minor amounts as a resultof the use of the additive.The petitioner presented data to show that the addition of 100 to 200 ppmof dimethyl dicarbonate to wine is effective in inhibiting the growth ofmost species of yeast found in wine. Based on this level of addition, fora wine intake of 232 grams per person per day (the 90th percentile consumptionlevel for ``drinkers only''_Most recent USDA Food Consumption Survey, 1977-78),and based on data submitted by the petitioner, the agency estimates thatthe maximum daily consumption of the minor reaction products resultingfrom the addition of dimethyl dicarbonate to wine is from 2 to 5 milligramsper person per day. Because these reaction products were formed in thedimethyl dicarbonate-treated fluids (water and wine) used in the subchronicand chronic rat and dog studies submitted by the petitioner, the safetyof the reaction products is evidenced by the findings of no-adverse effectsin these studies.The safety of methylethyl carbonate was further evaluated in a subchronictoxicity study in rats in which this substance was added to the drinkingwater at levels of 0, 1,000, 3,000 and 10,000 ppm for 3 months. The averagedaily consumption of methylethyl carbonate ranged from approximately 0.1milligram per kilogram to 1 gram per kilogram body weight per day. No adverseeffects in rats from drinking the water treated with methylethyl carbonatewere seen in this study.A teratogenicity study was conducted with pregnant female rats of the Long-EvansFB30 strain. The animals were fed diets containing methylethyl carbonateat levels of 0, 100, 1,000 and 10,000 ppm. No signs of toxicity were notedin the study report. However, there was a dose-related reduction in fluidintake and a slight decrease in body weight gain in pregnant females receivingmethylethyl carbonate throughout the gestational period. The reduced fluidintake appears to be attributable to the bad taste and smell of the watercontaining the methylethyl carbonate. All test and control females weresacrificed at day 20 (Cesarean sections were performed), and the fetuseswere examined. No embryotoxic or teratogenic effects were found in thisexamination.To establish the safety of dimethyl carbonate the petitioner submitteda subchronic study in which dimethyl carbonate was incorporated into thedrinking water at levels of 0, 1,000, 3,000 and 10,000 ppm. An increasein body weight gain was observed in male rats at all treated levels. Noadverse effects were found in this study at 10,000 ppm or at lower levels.B. Carbon DioxideCarbon dioxide, one of the principal hydrolysis products of dimethyl dicarbonate,is a natural product of animal metabolism. Prolonged exposure to concentrationsof carbon dioxide (in inhaled air) at levels higher than 5 volume per centmay lead to unconsciousness and death (Ref. 7). Carbon dioxide is presentin solution as the carbonate and bicarbonate anions, however, and is routinelyused to carbonate beverages (Ref. 8). The levels of carbon dioxide presentin wine as a result of the use of dimethyl dicarbonate are well below thelevels found in carbonated beverages. Thus, the agency has no evidencethat carbon dioxide would be harmful under the intended conditions of use.C. MethanolMethanol is the principal reaction product of concern resulting from additionof dimethyl dicarbonate to wine. Theoretically, complete hydroloysis ofdimethyl dicarbonate would yield 2 moles of methanol and 2 moles of carbondioxide from each mole of dimethyl dicarbonate added to wine. On a weightbasis, this yield corresponds to approximately 48 milligrams of methanolfor each 100 milligrams of the additive added to a liter of wine. In aqueous/alcoholicsolutions such as wine, the theoretical level of methanol is not achievedbecause dimethyl dicarbonate may also react with naturally occurring minorconstituents of the solution to form other chemicals in trace amounts.However, to estimate a worst case exposure of consumers to methanol fromthe proposed use of the additive, the agency assumed complete hydrolysisof dimethyl dicarbonate to methanol and carbon dioxide. Based on the additionof 100 to 200 mg dimethyl dicarbonate to one liter of wine and on a wineintake of 232 grams per person per day (90th percentile consumption level),the agency estimates that the daily intake of methanol from this use ofdimethyl dicarbonate would range from 11 to 22 milligrams per person perday (0.18 to 0.36 milligram per kilogram body weight for a 60 kilogramperson) (Ref. 1).The agency considers the daily intake of methanol from the addition ofdimethyl dicarbonate to wine, even when added to the amount of methanolnaturally present in other foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables andgrain alcohol, to be safe. An adult human can metabolize up to 1500 milligramsof methanol per hour with no adverse symptoms or effects (Ref. 2). Thelevels of methanol that occur in wine and fruit juices average up to 140milligrams per liter and an additional 50 to 100 milligrams per liter mayresult from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate, assuming a wine intake of232 grams per person per day (Ref. 1). The total methanol exposure fromthese sources would be up to 50 to 60 milligrams per person per day. Thereis, therefore, a large margin of safety between the methanol intake andthe amount which can be safely ingested.D. Methyl Carbamate<T3>1. Carcinogenicity.</T3> Reaction of dimethyl dicarbonate with naturallyoccurring ammonia or ammonium ions in wine may result in the formationof trace amounts of methyl carbamate which has been shown to be carcinogenicin rats (Ref. 3). FDA has evaluated the safety of this reaction by-productusing risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of riskpresented by the presence of this chemical as an impurity in wine treatedwith dimethyl dicarbonate. Based on this evaluation, the agency has concludedthat under the proposed conditions of use, dimethyl dicarbonate is safe.<T3>2. Basis for evaluation.</T3> The risk assessment procedures that FDAused in this evaluation are similar to the methods that it has used toexamine the risk associated with the presence of minor carcinogenic impuritiesin various food and color additives (see, e.g., 49 FR 13018; April 2, 1984).This evaluation of the risk from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate has twoaspects: (1) Assessment of the probable exposure to methyl carbamate producedin food from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate; and (2) extrapolation ofthe risk observed in the animal bioassay to the conditions of probableexposure to humans.Based on the level of methyl carbamate produced from the addition of dimethyldicarbonate to wine as a yeast inhibitor, as well as the estimated lifetimeconsumption of wine, FDA estimated the worst case exposure to methyl carbamateto be 2.4 micrograms per person per day (Refs. 1, 4, and 5). The agencyused data in a carcinogenesis bioassay report on methyl carbamate conductedby the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Ref. 4) to estimate the upper-boundlevel of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming fromthe proposed use of dimethyl dicarbonate.The bioassay report consisted of results from studies of methyl carbamatein both rats and mice. The bioassay in B6C3F1 mice was reported by NTPto be negative. The bioassay of methyl carbamate in F344/N rats consistedof a 2-year chronic study and a parallel study with sacrifices at 6, 12,and 18 months. The 2-year study employed a high dosage level of 200 milligramsper kilogram body weight. The parallel study employed one dosage levelof 400 milligrams per kilogram body weight. An increase in hepatocellularneoplasms was found at the high dose in female F344/N rats of the 2-yearstudy. In the parallel study, hepatocellular neoplasms were found at 6months in both sexes, and the sacrifices at the later times revealed aclassic picture of progression from benign to highly malignant neoplasmsdependent upon the length of time of exposure. The NTP concluded that ``therewas clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male and female F344/Nrats given methyl carbamate as indicated by incidences of hepatocellularneoplastic nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma'' (Ref. 3).<T3>3. Results of evaluation.</T3> Using the NTP bioassay report, the Centerfor Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Quantitative Risk Assessment Committee(QRAC) estimated the human cancer risk from the potential exposure to methylcarbamate stemming from the proposed use of dimethyl dicarbonate as a yeastinhibitor in wine (Refs. 4 and 5).The QRAC used a quantitative risk assessment procedure (linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animal experiment throughzero to cover the very low doses expected to be encountered under the proposedconditions of use of the additive. This procedure is not likely to understimatethe actual risk from the very low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate itbecause the extrapolation models used are designed to estimate the maximumrisk consistent with the data. For this reason, the estimate can be usedwith confidence to determine to a reasonable certainty whether any harmwill result from the proposed conditions and a level of use of 200 ppmof the food additive.Based on a worst case exposure to methyl carbamate (2.4 micrograms perperson per day), FDA estimated, using a simple linear model, that the upper-boundlimit of individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to methyl carbamateis 2.4andmultiply;10 ^8 or less than 1 in 42 million. Because of numerousconservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime avaraged individual exposureto methyl carbamate is expected to be substantially less than the estimateddaily intake, and, therefore, the calculated upper-bound risk would beless. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty ofno harm from the exposure to methyl carbamate that results from the useof up to 200 ppm of dimethyl dicarbonate in wine.<T3>4. Need for specifications.</T3> The agency has also considered whethera specification is necessary to control the amount of methyl carbamatethat may be formed in wine treated with the additive. The agency findsthat the amount of methyl carbamate formed in wine may be controlled bylimiting the amount of dimethyl dicarbonate that can be added to the wineto 200 ppm or less rather than by setting a specification for the levelof methyl carbamate impurity in wine. The petitioner submitted data toshow that the maximum level of methyl carbamate impurity formed in commercialwine is less than 10 parts per billion (ppb) for each 100 ppm of dimethyldicarbonate added to wine. A 200 ppm level of dimethyl dicarbonate is sufficientto control the growth of all significant genera and species of yeast inwine that has been adequately pasteurized or ultra/filtered according tocurrent good maufacturing practices to reduce the microbial count to 500per milliliter (ml) or less.E. Ethyl CarbamateThe petitioner submitted studies in which gas chromatography/mass spectroscopywas used to measure the formation of ethyl carbamate (urethane) in dimethyldicarbonate-treated wine and model wine solutions, in the presence of highconcentrations of ammonium ions. These studies, conducted over a 12-monthperiod, failed to show the formation of ethyl carbamate in excess of endogenouslevels found in wine. These studies also did not show evidence of formationof ethyl carbamate by transesterification of methyl carbamate. Thus thereis no indication that the use of dimethyl dicarbonate affects the levelof ethyl carbamate in wine.The agency is aware that ethyl carbamate, an animal carcinogen, occursas a contaminant in wine. The agency is in the process of obtaining asmuch information as possible about the levels of such ethyl carbamate contamination.In addition, in cooperation with the wine industry, a program, has beeninstituted to find and control the formation of ethyl carbamate so as toreduce it to the extent possible. (Agreement Between the Association ofAmerican Vintners, the Wine Institute, and FDA, ``Ethyl Carbamate VoluntaryProgram,'' Jan. 7, 1988) (Ref. 6). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion on Safety</ITAG>FDA has evaluated all of the data in the petition pertaining to the useof dimethyl dicarbonate in wine and has determined that the additive issafe for its proposed use.To ensure the safe to the additive, FDA, under 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(1)(A),finds that it is necessary to require that the label of the package containingthe additive contain, in addition to other information required by theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (1) the name of the additive, ``dimethyldicarbonate,'' and (2) directions to provide that not more than 200 ppmof dimethyl dicarbonate will be added to the wine.In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documentsthat FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approvethe petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safetyand Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact personlisted above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete fromthe documents any materials that are are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection.The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statementis not required.
