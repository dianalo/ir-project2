But, in an editorial of Nov. 21, you now grossly diminish President Carter's courageous act, however ill-conceived it may seem in retrospect, by using that precedent to justify President Reagan's acts six years later.    Plainly there is a vast difference between the approaches taken by Carter and by Reagan. To illustrate, I would only ask, what would have been the Journal's reaction had President Carter's rescue effort consisted, not of a courageous if foolhardy military mission, but rather of a secret trade of weapons for hostages? Would you have written, under that circumstance, &quot;Better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all&quot;?    Ray Jenkins   Baltimore   The writer was a special assistant to President Carter from 1979 to 1981.    ---   You justified the arms sale with the argument that it was important to open communications with so-called moderate elements in strategically important Iran. Assuming for a moment that these arms had such a beneficial effect, and therefore were such a wonderful advancement in foreign policy, one might suggest that such arms sales should also be made for the same beneficial effect to other strategically important countries with a belligerent attitude toward the U.S., such as Syria, Vietnam, Cuba, Libya and, yes (why not?), there might be moderate elements in the Soviet Union!    In a Nov. 26 editorial, you justify the illegal money transfers to the contras with the argument that the Boland amendment, which forbade such aid, forced the White House staff and the CIA into helping the contras in such a manner. You cavalierly disregard the fact that such aid was illegal, implying that some higher moral standard makes it OK.    There is no justification for our White House to have paid tribute and/or ransom to Iran. The excuses and double talk from Washington, echoed in your editorials, do not change or justify the fact ransom was paid, and do not justify opening secret bank accounts to circumvent the law.    Bill Kleronomos   Lyons, Colo.   ---   President Reagan's selling of arms to Iran was a mistake in only one area -- the way it was handled. Iran is the only barrier between Russia and the Persian Gulf oil riches. Russia already has Afghanistan and is the main supporter of Iraq. It is in Russia's interest for Iran to fall. If Iran falls through revolution or defeat by Iraq, Russia could, under almost any pretext, move into Iran, acquiring control of the Persian Gulf. Russian troops are only a day or two away from the Gulf. There is no valid way U.S. forces can play a decisive role in the area. We must work through Iran. That was the reason we supported the shah; it is still the reason we should arm Iran -- to protect our interests.    Wyatt E. Craft   Jackson, Miss.   ---   I wish to compliment you upon an exceptionally fine editorial &quot;Who Runs Foreign Policy?&quot; (Nov. 11).    Some initiative is justified in establishing and maintaining some contact with a country as strategically important as Iran. Owing to various adversaries in Iran, Syria, Lebanon and others, including people in the U.S., secrecy was and is essential.    Some seed needed to be planted or bait used, even if it included some military equipment. The critics are like those who would say that a fisherman using bait on a hook was feeding the fish.
