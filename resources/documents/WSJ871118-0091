Verity, confirmed as secretary of commerce only last month, wasted no time in finding a new form of &quot;unfair&quot; trade. Japanese companies are blocking trade adjustment, the secretary asserted Tuesday, by holding down the prices they charge American consumers.    The yen has risen sharply against the dollar since mid-1985 but prices of Japanese goods shipped to the U.S. have not risen accordingly, the secretary complained in a speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. By not raising prices, he said, Japanese companies are risking a wave of U.S. &quot;anti-dumping&quot; actions.    The secretary's threat preceded a three-day visit to Japan. Clearly, it was a good way of getting his hosts' attention. But it won't do much to improve the already strained bilateral relations between the two countries.    The Japanese may well ask whether American protectionists now are setting about to repeal market economics. Japanese companies, as with companies everywhere, do not set prices unilaterally. They price to meet competition.    In the U.S. market, the falling dollar has put Japanese imports under pressure. American companies have wider margins to work with in price competition and Japanese companies have less. In international markets, the cash flow of American companies is greater and the cash flow of Japanese companies is less as a result of altered exchange rates.    This doesn't especially please Japanese companies, but they have gone along with their government's arguments that a stronger yen is essential to adjusting world-wide trade flows. Indeed, the Japanese surplus in world-wide trade has been declining since the spring.    Japanese industries can draw some comfort from the likelihood that they eventually will adapt, through lower costs, to a more expensive yen and that profit margins will improve. But meanwhile they are trying to maintain their share of international markets.    Contrary to Mr. Verity's remarkable thesis, there is no trade rule that says alterations in exchange rates require multinational companies to price themselves out of business. If such a rule existed, there soon would be no multinationals, American or Japanese. Mr. Verity, when he was running Armco Steel, might well have resented any suggestion that he was not entitled to try to preserve his share of markets.    The Japanese trade surplus with the U.S. has not shrunk, but U.S. production is straining at its limits just to meet domestic demand. Companies seldom go looking for export markets when they can sell all they produce at home.    It's too bad someone didn't tell Mr. Verity, when he was preparing for his trip to Tokyo, that the Japanese have read Adam Smith and Milton Friedman. They understand something about markets. A U.S. official is entitled to try to further the cause of trade adjustment, but instructing Japanese producers on how to price their products is merely a good way to destroy U.S. credibility in a discussion that already is in some danger of turning into a mutually destructive brawl. </TEXT></DOC>
