In their initial reaction, Western diplomats welcomed theproposals and noted several concepts and language identical to NATOproposals on the same subject Sept. 21.   Negotiators from both blocs at the 23-nation talks hailed theprogress made during the six-week round, but expresseddisappointment that agreement on details is still rare.   ``Generally, we're making a lot of progress,'' U.S. AmbassadorStephen J. Ledogar told reporters. ``But specifically, we have notgot much concrete to show for it yet.''   ``More could have been done,'' said Soviet Ambassador OlegGrinevsky.   The only language agreed by both sides for an initial treatyboth blocs want to sign next year is the definition of artillery.   Ledogar, Grinevsky and West German Ambassador Ruediger Hartmannexpressed hope the fourth round, beginning Nov. 9 and lasting untilDec. 21, will see more discussion of specifics.   The Warsaw Pact proposals presented Thursday contained differentspecifics on limiting military maneuvers in Europe than earlierNATO suggestions. They omitted, for example, mention of limitationon equipment used in such exercises.   But the East accepted significant details of the West'sproposal. It agreed that no more than 40,000 men be engaged inmilitary maneuvers by one bloc, but sought to limit such largeexercises to once every three years, as against once every twoyears as proposed by NATO.   The East also agreed that annual exchange of verification datatake place on Dec. 15 once any treaty is in force, and that 42 daysbe the period of prior notification for changing force structures.   Both sides agreed major differences still exist over thedefinition of weapons categories such as tanks, the verification ofarmaments levels in different regions of Europe and the inclusionor exclusion of Soviet air defense interceptors, training aircraftand certain types of helicopter in the complex aircraft category.   ``The most urgent problem is definition'' of weapons categories,said Ledogar. ``The most complex is verification, and I think thetoughest one is still the aircraft issue.''   The talks opened in March. They replaced negotiations on troopreductions in central Europe that dragged on for 15 years withoutagreement.</TEXT></DOC>
