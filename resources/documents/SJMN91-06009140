I'm involved, but it's Craig's responsibility torun the team.&quot;;    Kelly didn't rule out the possibility of returning, but&quot;not while (Phil Jr.) is playing.&quot;;    The elder Kelly said he might beretired from his job as a physical-education teacher by the time his freshmanson's  college eligibility has been completed.;    Kelly ranks the Indians'1989-90 season, in which Fremont won Central Coast Section and NorthernCalifornia Division II titles, as his greatest coaching moment &quot;as far aswinning is concerned.&quot;;    &quot;But I've had a few more teams that have playedabove their heads,&quot; he said, &quot;and that's fun to see.&quot;;    Ellegood'stransition to head coach was smooth. He coached the Indians during summerleagues and makes the final decisions during games.;    His patience is beingput to the test. Fremont started the season 9-3 but has lost four straight,including the last two to start the De Anza Athletic League season.;    &quot;We'renot playing together, and we've lost our confidence,&quot; Ellegood said. &quot;We'replaying hard. We just have to find a way to make our shots and get out of this(rut).&quot;; NO REGRETS: Norm Friborg enjoys life after a 25-year stint as boys'basketball coach at Piedmont Hills.;    &quot;I've rechanneled my energies,&quot;Friborg said. &quot;I've read six books, and, until the weather got cold, I wasplaying nine holes of golf. I'm also riding a bicycle.&quot;;    The free time alsohas allowed Friborg, a 53-year-old counselor, to see more college basketballgames in person.;    He admitted, though, that it was difficult redirectinghis path each day after classes ended.;    &quot;It felt strange not walking to thegym after school ended,&quot; Friborg said. &quot;I've had to change my path to my carand not the gym.&quot;; THREE-POINT MANIA: If you still don't like the three-pointshot, consider the following statistics disclosed by Mercury News boys' highschool basketball statistician John Spalding.;    The study revealed thatSanta Clara County boys' players made 1,145 three-pointers (2.462 average perteam per game) in non-league games before Jan. 1, an all-time high since theshot was put into effect four seasons ago.
