Blue-chip issues trailed the broad market, reversing the recent pattern. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.85 to 2707.26, while advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about a 4-3 margin on the New York Stock Exchange.    But traders said anticipation of the round of U.S. economic reports due this week, along with Friday's &quot;triple witching hour&quot; expiration of stock index futures and options, continued to weigh on the market.    &quot;There just doesn't seem to be enough players or people willing to do anything,&quot; said Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. &quot;They're going to wait for a trend to develop, and then they're going to play.&quot;    Prices reached their highs at midmorning with the help of buy programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage. When index futures prices reached relatively sharp premiums to the cash indexes, arbitrage traders sold futures contracts and bought some or all of the underlying stocks.    Later in the session, speculation that the monthly report from the semiconductor industry would prove favorable generated buying of chip producers and selected computer stocks, traders said.    Semiconductor stocks outpaced other Dow Jones industry groups by a wide margin. Texas Instruments rose 7/8 to 41 1/8, Motorola gained 1 1/8 to 56 3/4, and Advanced Micro Devices went up 1/8 to 8 1/2. National Semiconductor firmed 1/4 to 7 1/2 despite reporting a $21.9 million loss for its latest quarter, a larger loss than analysts generally expected.    As for computer issues, International Business Machines added 5/8 to 116 7/8, Digital Equipment rose 2 1/4 to 99 1/2, Compaq Computer climbed 1 3/8 to 91 7/8, NCR rose 5/8 to 64 1/2, and Tandem Computers gained 3/4 to 23 1/8.    There were 824 issues advancing in price on the Big Board, while 632 fell. Among broader averages, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 1.04 to 348.70, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 1.14 to 327.62, and the Big Board Composite Index rose 0.58 to 193.88.    Volume totaled 142,140,000 shares, compared with 126,020,000 Monday, as activity remained relatively subdued. &quot;What we need is some kind of a trigger, something new to provide inspiration to this market,&quot; said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    That inspiration isn't likely to come from the upturn in the technology sector, Mr. Acuff said, although those stocks have been left out of the market's rise in recent months. &quot;The question is whether that's another flash in the pan,&quot; he said, as previous rallies in the sector have come and gone quickly.    Oil stocks, which have been on the rise along with oil prices recently, continued to improve. Exxon gained 3/4 to 45 3/8 on Big Board composite volume of 1.5 million shares, Chevron advanced 5/8 to 59 1/4, Mobil rose 7/8 to 57 3/4, and Amoco gained 5/8 to 49 7/8. Unocal, which Oppenheimer andamp; Co. called the industry's top takeover candidate, jumped 2 5/8 to 57 3/4.    On the other hand, the steel sector was among the market's poorest performers. Armco eased 1/2 to 12 5/8, Bethlehem Steel lost 1/4 to 21 1/2, Inland Steel Industries dropped 3/8 to 43 5/8, and Allegheny Ludlum fell 3/8 to 38.    Bethlehem contributed to the sluggishness in the industrial average, as did Woolworth, which went down 1 1/2 to 69 1/2; Sears Roebuck, down 1/4 to 44 7/8; Philip Morris, down 1 to 160 3/8; Du Pont, down 5/8 to 117 5/8; and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber, down 3/4 to 56 1/8.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average ended a four-session losing streak by rising 7.47 to 1477.06. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, climbed 4 5/8 to 281 and accounted for most of the average's gain.    Datapoint topped the list of active Big Board issues on 2.7 million shares and fell 1/2 to 5 3/8. New York investor Asher Edelman, the company's chairman, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report a group he controls raised its stake to more than 40% by purchasing a total of about three million shares this week. The buying followed the disclosure that another investor, Martin S. Ackerman, plans a proxy fight for control of Datapoint's board; Mr. Ackerman said he would file suit to block the Edelman group from carrying out the purchases.    Quantum Chemical dropped 3/8 to 44 5/8 in the wake of an explosion and fire at its Morris, Ill., plant. Elsewhere in the chemical sector, Avery International advanced 1 to 28 3/4; Bear Stearns began analyst coverage of the company with a favorable rating.    Penn Central gained 7/8 to 27 1/2. Kidder Peabody repeated its buy recommendation on the stock, and analyst Donald A. Zwyer said the company may be taken private through a management-led leveraged buyout. Penn Central declined to comment.    Sealed Air tacked on 1 1/2 to 22 1/2. Oppenheimer began its coverage of the company with a buy rating and placed the stock on its special research recommendation list.    Xtra, which agreed to sell its railroad fleet to Chrysler for $85 million, gained 3/4 to 31 7/8. The company, which also agreed to sell its warehousing operations to an unidentified buyer, said it expects to post a slight pretax loss on the sales. It didn't elaborate.    Businessland climbed 7/8 to 12 1/2. The company's board approved plans to purchase as many as five million of its common shares, about 16% of the total outstanding.    The American Stock Exchange Index gained 2.11 to 384.54, just eclipsing its record of 384.53 set last Tuesday. Volume totaled 11,910,000 shares, compared with 11,080,000 Monday. There were 306 issues advancing, 269 declining and 275 unchanged.    Atari, the most active Amex issue, climbed 1 1/4 to 12 3/8 as 1.3 million shares changed hands in composite trading.    International Recovery added 5/8 to 15 7/8. The company agreed to acquire the aviation-fuel marketing operations of JCO Energy Partners for about $6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
