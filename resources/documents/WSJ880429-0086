According to one analyst, the lull in Vienna both contributed to market softness and also helped to temper the price decline. Among the products, gasoline futures drew increasing interest from traders. Apparently influenced by the approach of warmer weather, they seemed to be liquidating positions in heating oil and switching to gasoline, an analyst said. As a result, although gasoline prices also were under pressure, losses were smaller than for heating oil.    The price of June-delivery West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, declined below the critical level of $18 a barrel level, settling at $17.98, down 29 cents. The contract had fallen as low as $17.95 in late trading.    June-delivery heating oil dropped 0.83 cent a gallon to 48.26 cents and June gasoline was off 0.61 cent a gallon to 51.68 cents.    &quot;I haven't seen anything come out of the talks that looks positive,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president for energy and research, Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area distributor.    The size of the possible production cutbacks appear to be getting smaller, he said. &quot;A week ago, there was talk that (total OPEC and non-OPEC) output might be cut by a million barrels per day; now half of that is being discussed,&quot; he said.    Saudi Arabia is the key to the situation, according to Mr. Ritterbusch. &quot;For a long time, the Saudis have adhered to quotas and have watched others cheat by producing more. I doubt if they're going to agree to cut their output.&quot;    In the opinion of Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster, Saudi Arabia is trying to exert influence on non-OPEC nations in the same way it tried with smaller OPEC producers a decade ago.    &quot;Any kind of agreement along the 5% cut proposed would amount to shift of market share away from non-OPEC producers to OPEC members,&quot; Mr. Higby said.    A cut by OPEC members would be in production, whereas a reduction by non-OPEC members would be in exports, he said. &quot;That means that Saudi exports really wouldn't be affected while those of non-OPEC producers would be reduced,&quot; he said.    OPEC members sell about three-quarters of their output, compared with about half for non-OPEC producers, he said.    In addition, Mr. Higby said, &quot;you have Iraq and Iran, each of whom sells roughly as much as Saudi Arabia currently sells. Iraq is exempt from quotas and Iran doesn't pay attention, so oil from those two countries would continue to flow freely onto the market, even though Iran has to repair some oil rigs.&quot;    Robert C. Baker, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. senior energy analyst, said the current selloff may have been overdone. &quot;There was disappointment when it appeared that OPEC would not be amenable to cuts. But, then, no one claimed there would be any,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices closed about two-thirds of a point lower on low unemployment data and a weaker dollar. The Commerce Department said that unemployment claims for the week ended April 16 totaled 275,000, the lowest in a non-holiday week since December 1973. &quot;This looks like a bear market. It's ugly,&quot; said Karen Gibbs, a futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. She noted that holidays next week in Japan and European markets will sharply depress the trading volume in U.S. fixed-income markets, making a significant rally unlikely. Treasury bond futures for June settlement fell 23/32 to 87 7/8.    COFFEE: Futures prices declined. The July contract ended 1.48 cents a pound lower, at $1.328. According to one analyst, selling in a routine market caused the July price to break below the key support level of $1.34, which triggered further selling. Another analyst observed that the International Coffee Organization reported that exports from October through March, the first half of the organization's fiscal year, amounted to 23.6 million 132-pound bags, the lowest level in six years. This was two million bags below allocated export quotas, the organization said. The prospect of the shortage being made up during the second half of the fiscal year tended to reduce roaster demand for coffee beans, the analyst said.    COTTON: Futures price rose in anticipation of continued strong exports from the new U.S. crop, but a U.S. Agriculture Department report issued after the close of trading fell short of expectations. July-delivery cotton rose 0.37 cent a pound to 62.88 cents, while delivery months from October forward, which represent the next harvest, rose as much as 1.18 cents. According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, traders were disappointed with the report, which showed export sales for the week ended April 21 from the 1988-89 crop beginning Aug. 1 amounting to only 29,700 bales. &quot;Last week, sales were 37,000 bales and traders had been expecting at least that much if not more,&quot; Mr. Simon said. </TEXT></DOC>
