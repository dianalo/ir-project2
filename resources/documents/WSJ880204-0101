Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> HRB GCI MHP KRI LK DJ </CO><IN> PUB TEL </IN><TEXT>   U.S. electronic information companies are attempting to boost foreign sales of interactive on-line data services.    Handamp;R Block Inc.'s CompuServe Inc. unit formed a joint venture last week to provide its corporate electronic information systems and business databases to South American companies.    Gannett Co. and McGraw-Hill Inc. also are pushing for foreign business. Knight-Ridder Corp.'s financial services group introduced its on-line financial data service in Tokyo in January, after entering Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Australia last year.    Lockheed Corp.'s Dialog Information Services Inc. named a European marketing manager in December, opened an office in France and said it plans a similar move soon in Germany and at least one Scandinavian nation.    Foreign customers are already 30% of Dialog's overall sales, and the company is now beefing up overseas efforts in several nations. In the past, Dialog's foreign agents have largely trained customers to use Dialog services. Now, Dialog is training the trainers in direct marketing and sales techniques, and giving them more financial incentives to push the product.    For all but a few concerns, the efforts are fledgling. Foreign revenue or profit approaching domestic levels are years away, industry executives say. In 1986, the latest figures available, domestic sales of on-line interactive data totaled $3.75 billion, according to Link Resources Corp., a market research and consulting firm.    Still, &quot;companies are recognizing the (foreign business) opportunities in international data flow,&quot; says Bernell Wright, a Link vice president. Says Charles W. McCall, CompuServe's president:&quot;Many of the databases we offer in the U.S. have marketability in other parts of the world, and we are trying to spread out and take advantage of them.&quot;    The global importance of common financial data was pressed home to the industry with last fall's stock and bond market collapse. While one-way information services are widely available overseas, U.S. companies are now trying to boost sales of more sophisticated interactive services that enable users to retrieve information via computer hook-ups.    The Information Services Group of Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, as part of a long term strategic goal, has sought to supply its on-line data overseas, in part through a unit of K.K. Kyodo News Service. Last year, I.P. Sharp Associates Ltd., a unit of Reuters Inc., and British Telecommunications PLC, began making Dow Jones News/Retrieval available to their customers in Britain and world-wide.    McGraw-Hill's Standard andamp; Poor's Co. unit expects foreign sales of its MarketScope data service to account for 10% of the product's total sales by 1991. &quot;We are starting to push it,&quot; says Joseph Oppenheimer, an Sandamp;P senior vice president. </TEXT></DOC>
