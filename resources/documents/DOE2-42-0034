<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0034 </DOCNO><TEXT>The baryon properties and the skyrmeon-skyrmeon (SS) interaction is investigatedwithin the frame of constants in the model are taken as well as possiblewithin the experimental data of the {pi}{pi} scattering. Two kinds ofgate the contribution of the new destabilizer L/sub 4s/ (the symmetricquartic terms). The case that the L/sub 4s/ terms is not included tomake clear the role of the term is also invetigated. It is shown thatthe calculated SS interaction potential is projected onto the NN, N{Delta}and{Delta}4D channels by using and tensor decomposition technique in thespin-isospin space SO(4) and is classified by the asymptotic behaviours.This decomposition is convenient to discuss what ingradients are involvedin the potential. It is pointed out that the additive ansatz for the{omega}-field which is used in the study of SS interaction by the explicitinclusion of the {omega}-coupling terms is not correct when one calculatesathe SS interaction potential in the short range. The calculation of thephase shift in the proton-proton scattering by using the obtained SSinteraction is also shown. 21 refs.; 5 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
