The constitution prescribed a referendum for thisyear on a military-picked candidate to serve as president until1997. That candidate is Gen. Augusto Pinochet, ruler for the past15 years. The referendum is set for this week. Chile is at acrossroads.</TEXT><BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A geographical stringbean between theAndes and the sea, Chile always seemed separate and distinct fromother countries in South America.   It had the longest tradition of democracy. Its schools anduniversities forged a highly literate society: more than 90 percentof its people can read and write. It dug a wealth of copper fromits mountainsides, harvested rich crops from its soil and pluckedfish in abundance from its seas.   In contrast to its neighbors who lurched from one militarydictator or civilian strongman to another, Chile lived inrelatively prosperous stability in the years after achievingindependence from Spain in 1818.   But in 1970, Chilean stability began to falter following theelection to the presidency of Salvador Allende, a self-declaredMarxist whose change in direction from the past brought politicaland economic disorder.   On the morning of Sept. 11, 1973, Chile's long tradition ofelected, representative government came to an end.   The military, declaring the nation on the verge of a communisttakeover, seized power in a bloody coup.   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the coup leader, became president in amilitary dictatorship. He has remained in office for 15 years.   On Wednesday, Oct. 5, the 7 million registered voters amongChile's 12 million people will be asked to decide in a yes-noreferendum whether they want the 72-year-old Pinochet to stay on astheir leader for eight more years _ until 1997.   ``Joy is coming,'' goes an election campaign jingle ofPinochet's opponents, confidently predicting his demise inWednesday's referendum.   ``The Marxists are coming,'' counters a pro-Pinochet televisionadvertisement, meaning a vote against Pinochet would set Chile backto the Allende years of the early 1970s.   Chile stands this week on the doorstep of a future blurred bytwo radically distinct ideological visions. The deep split betweenPinochet's opponents and backers tends to color the country'stroubled past and its present as well.   Pinochet is the sole candidate in the referendum, which hasspawned reflection and debate on the merits of his administrationand on the chain of events that led to his seizing power.   Allende's leftist policies and the fierce opposition to them setoff widespread economic and social upheaval, including paralyzingstrikes and street violence, shortages of basic goods and an angrypolarization of society that has left deep scars.   In the aftermath, a U.S. congressional investigation found thatthe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency financed efforts todestabilize Allende's government. It also found that theInternational Telephone and Telegraph Corp., which had substantialinvestments in Chile, financed efforts to prevent Allende fromtaking office after he was elected. Allende nationalized ITT afterassuming the presidency and the corporation left Chile long beforePinochet's coup in 1973.   Historians today debate whether the CIA's involvement had a realimpact, and Pinochet denies any direct foreign involvement in thecoup or its planning.   Upon taking power, Pinochet declared a mission to purge thenation of what he saw as communism and to forge a society heenvisioned as based on the values of family, hard work and love ofcountry.   Pinochet and his supporters say the coup saved Chile, eventhough it snapped a decades-long chain of democratically electedgovernments. Allende died in the coup, his supporters charging hewas killed by soldiers and the military claiming he committedsuicide with a weapon given him by Cuba's Fidel Castro.   All Chileans agree that Pinochet's 15 years of military rulehave been marked by profound change. They argue heatedly, however,whether it has been for better or for worse.   Pinochet's supporters talk of a ``silent revolution'' in whichChile has become a modern, efficient nation with a stable economicbase. They claim to see an emergence from Third Worldunderdevelopment.   The country is in its fifth straight year of steady economicgrowth, with the gross national product projected to rise 6 percentin 1988. The official inflation rate has declined to about 10percent a year, a fraction of the Latin American average. Theforeign debt of $20 million is being paid off on time, and isactually shrinking.   Export earnings have soared and are projected at $6.8 billionthis year, up 46 percent from 1984. Foreign investment is atunprecedented levels, surpassing $300 million in the first sixmonths of 1988 alone. Once-bloated state industries have beenstreamlined and, in dozens of cases, auctioned off whole or in partto private business.   In his campaign, Pinochet promises growth and stability.   ``We can't turn our back on progress,'' he told the nationrecently, maintaining that his defeat in the referendum would bringback leftist experiments and the chaos of the Allende years.   Even his critics give his economic performance at least faintpraise.   ``There has been a positive macro-economic policy in the lastfour years,'' said Andres Zaldivar, vice-president of the centristChristian Democratic Party.   But Zaldivar, who spoke in an interview, and other Pinochet foessay most Chileans are still struggling to recover from a fiercerecession in 1982, which they blame on a radical free-marketexperiment launched after the coup and only later modified. Inaddition, the recent boom has benefited the rich much more than anyother social group.   ``Pinochet has destroyed the middle class,'' Zaldivar contended.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
