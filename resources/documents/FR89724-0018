Background</ITAG>The DoD FAR Supplement is codified in Chapter 2 Title 48 of the Code ofFederal Regulations.The October 1, 1988, revision of the CFR is the most recent edition ofthat title. It reflects amendments to the 1986 edition of the DoD FAR Supplementmade by Defense Acquisition Circulars 86-1 through 86-16.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Public Comments</ITAG>DAC 88-10, Items I, II, IV, V, VII, IX, X, and XIPublic comments are not solicited with respect to these revisions sincesuch revisions do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage inthe DFARS having a significant impact on contractors or offerors, or donot have a significant effect beyond agency internal operating procedures.DAC 88-10, Item IIIA proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 27, 1988 (53 FR 37611), and publiccomments were solicited. Those public comments were considered in the developmentof this final rule.DAC 88-10, Item IVA proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 21, 1988 (53 FR 41390), and publiccomments were solicited. Only one comment was received and that commentconcurred with the proposed rule.DAC 88-10, Item VIIIA proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 3, 1988 (53 FR 38749), and publiccomments were requested. Only two comments were received, and they wereconsidered in the development of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>DAC 88-10, Items I, II, IV, V, IX, X, and XIThese final rules do not constitute a significant revision within the meaningof Pub. L. 98-577, and publication for public comment is not required.Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. However, commentsfrom small entities concerning the affected DoD FAR Supplement Subpartwill be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such commentsmust be submitted separately. Please cite DAR Case 89-610D in correspondence.DAC 88-10, Item IIIThis final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. because the changes apply to only those smallentities who want to contract with the Government to supply hazardous materials(as defined in the latest version of Federal Standard 313). Most smallentities affected by the changes will be distributors rather than manufacturers.An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been performed, butcomments were invited from small businesses and other interested parties.None were received.DAC 88-10, Item VIThis final rule does not constitute a significant revision within the meaningof Pub. L. 98-577 as the coverage is simply transferred to the FAR.DAC 88-10, Item VII As stated in the joint policy directive (53 FR 52889), the Office of FederalProcurement Policy and the Small Business Administration will prepare theappropriate regulatory flexibility analysis upon completion of the firstquarterly review under the program.DAC 88-10, Item VIII A full, final regulatory impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis wasprepared by DOL and a summary was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 29, 1983 (48 FR 19541) when DOL publishedits regulation. DFARS 222.4 is an implementation of the policy and regulationpublished by DOL. This final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because it merely codifiesin the DFARS (48 CFR), for the convenience of contractors and Governmentcontracting personnel, regulations issued by DOL and codified in 29 CFRfor which comments were requested and considered. Accordingly, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply to this rule, and comments are not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">D.
