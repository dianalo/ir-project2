(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Baltimore and Washington once shared littlebesides I-95, the American League and Eastern Time. Baltimore wasblue-collar muscle, Washington white-collar power; there wereOrioles and Colts fans, and there were Senators and Redskins fans.   Now there is Allan Fleming, who lives in this community near thedivide in the Washington-Baltimore commutersheds. ``He's a real bigOrioles fan and a dyed-in-the-wool Redskins fan,'' says Fleming'swife, Pepper.   He's also a resident of BaltWash, one name for the continuouslypopulated region of 6 million people stretching from north-centralVirginia to eastern West Virginia to the Pennsylvania line.   The 1990 census will almost certainly redefine greaterWashington and Baltimore as one Consolidated MetropolitanStatistical Area _ ``the largest merger of metropolitan areas inworld history,'' according to Census Bureau demographer RichardForstall.   When the century began, Americans lived in isolated spots offarmland and open country, or huddled together in central citiesand towns. As it moves into its last decade, they are sprawling outin all directions.   ``Metropolitan areas are bumping into each other,'' says PeterMuller, a University of Miami urban geographer. ``It's beenhappening for years, but now you can really see it.''   You can see it in the region between Boston and Washington,where ``Megalopolis'' _ the vast city forecast by Jean Gottman 30years ago _ now includes 25 continguous metropolitan areas andone-sixth of the nation's population.   The Census Bureau says the four most advanced sections ofMegalopolis are Boston-Providence, New York-Philadelphia,Harrisburg-York, Pa., and Washington-Baltimore. Within eachsection, substantial numbers of people live in one metro area andcommute to another.   The metropolitan economies of Baltimore and Washington are themost tightly entwined. Here in Columbia, 24 miles from theWashington Monument, 14 from Baltimore's Inner Harbor, couples likeBob and Susan Klukas rise each morning and head off in oppositedirections, she toward Baltimore, he toward Washington.   Their big city loyalties are mixed. They read both the Sun andthe Post, but Susan says they're more apt to visit downtownBaltimore, which is an easier drive.   Fellow Columbians Pepper and Allan Fleming, on the other hand,find themselves attending more social functions in Washington,where he is an executive at The Washington Times.   Residents of BaltWash exult in the area's great variety ofgoods, services and attractions. You can take in opera atWashington's Kennedy Center one night and visit the NationalAquarium in Baltimore the next day. When Washington's baseballSenators and Baltimore's football Colts defected, the sting waseased by the presence of the pro teams that remained.   Each of the merging metro areas is becoming more economicallydiverse. Washington is known for bureaucracy, but its immediatesuburbs have many high-tech industries. Baltimore's skyline is nowcharacterized not by smokestacks but office towers.   Others see a darker side to BaltWash. When Columbia residentHoward Knudson was growing up in the suburbs west of Baltimore,there was still plenty of open space. Now, says his wife Jean,``the traffic is awful, and every square inch has something on it _houses, townhouses or apartments.''   BaltWash _ or WashBalt _ is just one part of the emergingMegalopolis. New York and Philadelphia are meeting in Bucks County,Pa., Princeton, N.J., and along the highways leading to theDelaware River. Northern New Jersey, Muller notes, ``is beginningto fill in. There are no real breaks in the urban landscape.''   Although the city of Boston has fewer than 600,000 people andcovers only 47 square miles, its metropolitan domain stretchesnorth into New Hampshire, west to Worcester and south to RhodeIsland. ``Boston has been doing this for so long,'' marvelsForstall of the Census Bureau. ``It absorbed Cambridge in the 1800sand never looked back.''   A continent away, Los Angeles and San Diego are on a collisioncourse as new housing clusters pop up in the arid expanses betweenthem. The San Francisco Bay area has become one vast metropolis inwhich San Franciscans comprise only 13 percent of the population.   Specialists debate how far and fast this expansion will go, butRutgers urban affairs expert George Sternlieb says one thing isclear: ``The United States is decentralizing faster than anysociety in history.''   Arthur C. Nelson, a planner at Georgia Tech, says his researchshows that if present trends continue, by 2020 or 2030 almost halfof the mainland could be classified ``exurban'' _ places wherepeople live on five-, 10- or even 30-acre tracts, and drive fairlylong distances to jobs, social engagements, and other destinations.   The only land with nothing on or near it, he says, will begovernment-owned or ``undevelopable,'' such as mountains and floodplains.   Nelson is struck by the speed with which industry is movingbeyond the urban periphery. Once, manufacturers needed to be nearthe city's workers and rail lines, but now tax laws and land pricesencourage them to spread out, as long as they remain within a day'struck ride of the city.   That requires limited-access highways, of which the nation hasplenty. Federal transportation planner Douglass Lee says one-thirdof the interstates carry fewer than 8,000 vehicles a day _ enoughto fill only a two-lane street. For every I-95, busy from Floridato Maine, there is an I-88, virtually empty from Albany toBinghamton, N.Y.   Such routes do not serve American settlement; they spread it.``Look at the map of the interstate system,'' says Rutgershistorian Robert Fishman, ``and you will see the future of theAmerican city.''   In other words, the future lies in such places as Ulster County,N.Y., and Loudon County, Va., where the city dweller now still canfind the balm of open space.   The walls seem to be closing in. Gertrude Stein once observed,from the vantage point of crowded Paris, that ``in the UnitedStates there is more room where nobody is than where everybody is.That is what makes America what it is.''
