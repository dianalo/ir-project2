The indictment alleges that more than $1 million was involved.   Secord, 56, a retired Air Force major general who already facedone set of charges in the affair, was accused of seven counts ofperjury to Congress and one count of obstructing the congressionalIran-Contra investigation in 1987.   A ninth charge accused him of making a false statement to staffmembers for the congressional panels by saying he wasn't aware thatany money generated by his Iran-Contra transactions had benefitedNorth.   Each charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prisonand a $250,000 fine on conviction.   Secord was the leadoff witness in the televised hearingsconducted in the spring and summer of 1987 by the House and Senatecommittees.   The lastest charges by a federal grand jury were handed up April7, but weren't unsealed until Thursday in order to avoid bringingthem out during the trial of North, who was convicted on three of12 Iran-Contra counts last Thursday.   Secord's lawyers said in a statement, ``The decision to indictagain is vindictive and contrary to any notion of fair play andprofessionalism.'' They asked for financial assistance to help payfor his defense.   Meanwhile Thursday, Secord was convicted of driving whileintoxicated in late February in nearby Fairfax County, Va.   District Court Judge Barbara Kimble found Secord guilty,suspending $200 of a $500 fine and suspending a 30-day jail term.She ordered that he be given a restricted license permitting him todrive between his home, work and an alcohol safety program. Thepenalties were stayed because Secord appealed to Fairfax CountyCircuit Court, where his case is to be heard Aug. 24.   The new Iran-Contra indictment was issued by a federal grandjury that last fall began investigating possible perjury by variousfigures in the affair.   Asked whether ``other key players'' would face charges,independent counsel Lawrence Walsh declined to comment.   Eight of the new charges relate ``to Secord's financial interestin the enterprise which ... delivered weapons to the Contras'' andshipped arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986, Walsh told reporters infront of the U.S. Courthouse.   ``The enterprise'' was the maze of companies set up around theworld by Secord and business partner Albert Hakim to carry out theContra arms shipments and the Reagan administration's arms sales toIran. More than $47 million ``was received, managed anddisbursed,'' said the indictment.   Walsh said the ninth count relates to alleged lying about a$200,000 fund set up through Hakim, Secord and Swiss-based lawyerWillard Zucker for North's family in the event he failed to returnfrom a trip to Iran in 1986, and about North's acceptance of a$13,800 home security system. The charge accuses Secord of denyingto lawyers for the congressional Iran-Contra panels that he wasaware of any money from the enterprise that went to benefit North.   The convictions against North included illegally accepting thesecurity system.   North testified at his trial that he hadn't known about the$200,000 death benefit set aside for his wife and children, thoughhe had sent his wife, Betsy, to Philadelphia to discuss the matterwith Zucker.   The indictment said Secord lied when he told Congress:   _He had no interest in Korel Assets Inc., a corporation thatheld his share of the profits from covertly running arms to theContras and secretly shipping arms to Iran. ``The Korel account,unlike the other enterprise accounts, was set aside for thepersonal use of Richard V. Secord,'' said the indictment.   _He had waived his interest in profits of the enterprise andZucker had managed ``several hundred thousand dollars, maybe$400,000'' for him through the years. The indictment said Secordretained a personal interest in the profits of the enterprise anddidn't advise Zucker he was waiving any interest. It alleged Zuckerwas used ``to manage over a million dollars of profits allocated tothe defendant, Richard V. Secord.''   _He received only his $6,000 a month salary from the arms salesto Iran and to the Contras.   _$400,000 to $500,000 paid to his and Hakim's Virginia companywas money lent from a Swiss investment services firm operated byZucker's firm, Compagnie de Services Fiduciaries.   _Funds invested in a company called Tri-American Arms came fromHakim and not from profits of the enterprise. He also was accusedof lying by denying that one purpose of the Tri-American venturewas to sell arms to the Contras.   _Defex S.A., a shell corporation was used by the enterprise todisguise the source and location of enterprise money from armsdealers. Instead, says the indictment, Secord and others used DefexS.A. ``to hide and disguise from Contra leaders and Americanofficials the true prices the enterprise was paying for weapons forthe Contras, and the profits they were taking for themselves.''   _He had no beneficial interest in any foreign accounts.   Previously, Secord was indicted on March 16, 1988, along withNorth, Hakim and North's boss, former National Security AdviserJohn Poindexter.   All four men were accused of conspiracy and theft of governmentproperty in illegally diverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iranarms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. The conspiracy andtheft counts against North were dropped due to national securityconcerns.   Other charges against Secord from March 1988 were wire fraud,conspiracy to pay an illegal gratuity, offer of an illegal gratuityand payment of an illegal gratuity.</TEXT></DOC>
