The four were picked up by a Lutheran missionary from Finland,Olle Ericsson; given medical treatment by an Australian medic, andthen carried 38 miles north to Oshikango, where Australianengineers raised a U.N. flag Tuesday to mark one of the borderpoints where the guerrillas could have safe passage into Angola.   A U.N. peace plan designed to lead to elections in November andto independence for this South African-ruled territory wasendangered April 1, when South Africa said hundreds of South-WestAfrican People's Organization guerrillas had crossed the borderfrom Angola into northern Namibia. In a week of fighting, 263 SWAPOmen and 27 policemen and South African soldiers died.   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma asked his men to return to Angola,and the United Nations put up blue and white flags at nine assemblypoints in the territory to attract the guerrillas. Churches weremade safe havens under an agreement among South Africa, Cuba andAngola.   However, no cease-fire was in effect, and South African soldierscontinued to search vehicles on the road while policemen kept watchon churches.   Because the U.N.-manned assembly points were set up near SouthAfrican military camps, doubts arose as to whether SWAPO guerrillaswould venture near them. But about 200 churches and missionstations exist in northern Namibia, and they were considered themost likely places for the guerrillas to go.   ``This morning you were all skeptical and said it wouldn't work.Now I've proved you wrong and this is just the beginning,'' ajubilant Pakistani U.N. military observer said to journalists.   The reporters gathered at the end of the journey at Oshikango tosee the four guerrillas placed in tents and given medical aid byAustralian soldiers.   The Pakistani officers _ identified only as Lt. Col. Farooq,Capt. Nadir Zeb and Capt. Afafizab _ indicated the guerrillas wouldnot be questioned by the South Africans, as was suggested Wednesdayby a spokesman for Namibia's administrator-general, Louis Pienaar.The South Africans want to find out from the guerrillas how manyare leaving.   One SWAPO guerrilla, wounded by shrapnel under his left arm,arrived at the mission station in the morning and told Ericsson hehad three comrades who wanted to come in. Ericcson notified U.N.monitors at the Ondangwa airbase, three miles northwest, and thenheaded into the bush in a landrover.   He promised the Associated Press and Newsweek photographers atthe scene he would return.   An hour later, he came back with two healthy SWAPO fighters andone with a bullet imbedded under his left arm and scarcely able tostand. All wore civilian clothes and had ditched their weapons.   Local residents gathered around to shake the fighters' hands.One, unwounded, said he was 38 years old and had lived in exile for14 years.   He said he crossed the border on March 31, and fought the nextday. He said he saw one South African soldier or policeman go downin battle, but when his rifle jammed, he threw it away and leftbefore he saw what happened to his comrades.   After first aid treatment, the Pakistani observers loaded theguerrillas into a white-painted U.N. landrover. As they traveledthe road, with South African armored personnel carriers drivingpast and brown-unifomred soldiers posted at sandbags across thehighway, a Pakistani officer said the guerrillas were ``scared, ohyes, very scared.''   By the time they reached Oshikango, the South African soldiersat the military camp there knew who was in the vehicle, but didnothing as it drove through sand and bushes into the U.N. base 200yards away. The U.N. soldiers helped the wounded guerrillas fromthe truck, and placed them in a tent while plans were made to sendthem across the border to their bases in Angola.   If the U.N. plan goes according to schedule, a few weeks fromnow they may come back, without weapons, to settle in Namibia andvote in U.N.-supervised elections.</TEXT></DOC>
