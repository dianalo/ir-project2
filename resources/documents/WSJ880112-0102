Jean Pierson, president of the European airliner consortium, said Airbus is trying this approach with certain willing airlines to ameliorate the effects of the dollar's decline. As commercial airliners usually are priced in dollars, a transaction in European currencies would help Airbus cover its costs and could be beneficial to some airlines. The executive didn't identify the airlines considering the plan.    Mr. Pierson said an example would be an aircraft sales agreement denominated 25% in French francs, 25% in marks, 25% in pounds and 25% in dollars. Airbus isn't alone in taking this initiative, he added.    Mr. Pierson, speaking at a news conference here, said that Airbus and its four owners &quot;absolutely must cut costs by 30% to 35%&quot; to compensate for the dollar's sharp decline against major European currencies in the past two years. Airbus pays its owners in dollars for the design and production work they do for the consortium and incur in their own currencies. The partners are Aerospatiale of France; Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany; British Aerospace PLC; and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    Some of the partners have complained in recent months about the dire effects the dollar's fall and Airbus projects are having on their balance sheets.    Mr. Pierson confirmed that the consortium is having sales discussions &quot;with certain airlines&quot; in East bloc nations. He said that technology-transfer limitations demanded by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control pose certain problems. But sales to East bloc airlines &quot;are not impossible,&quot; he said.    Regarding U.S. complaints about Airbus's government subsidies, Mr. Pierson said that when the European Community, the U.S. and a number of other countries signed a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aircraft accord nearly a decade ago, &quot;the Airbus system of financing was well-known to the Americans.&quot;    Negotiators are trying to reach an accord this spring that satisfies the U.S. Meanwhile, he said, 1994 remains Airbus's target date for achieving profitability -- without government assistance.    ---   Rolls-Royce Engine Tested   Special to The Wall Street Journal   LONDON -- Rolls-Royce PLC said the V-2500 engine, which has been plagued by development problems, has passed important performance tests and is on schedule to be fitted for service in Airbus A-320 aircraft in spring 1989.    The V-2500 is being developed by International Aero Engines AG, a five-nation consortium in which Rolls-Royce has a 30% stake. But problems with the engine's compression system, designed by Rolls-Royce, had raised doubts about whether the V-2500 could meet its scheduled deadline. The V-2500 is due to be certified in June. Flight testing in the A-320 will begin in July.    The Rolls-Royce announcement came on the final day for foreign investors holding 5.7%, or about 46 million, of the company's shares to sell their stock to keep Rolls-Royce's foreign shareholding within the government's prescribed 15% limit. A Rolls-Royce official said the company would know the outcome in several days.    On London's stock exchange, Rolls-Royce shares were quoted at 134 pence, up one penny. </TEXT></DOC>
