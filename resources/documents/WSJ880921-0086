On Monday, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., the U.S. investment arm of New Zealand financier Ronald Brierley, and the securities firm of D.S. Kennedy andamp; Co., San Francisco, offered to buy all the shares of Molokai Ranch they don't already own for $45 a share. Molokai Ranch had 858,767 shares outstanding as of Aug. 11. Industrial Equity and Kennedy together own about 50% of those shares, giving the offer a value of about $19.3 million.    Molokai Ranch owns one-third of Molokai Island, and is engaged in land development and construction there and on the mainland. Industrial Equity and Kennedy said they were interested &quot;in realizing greater values based upon the development or disposition of the company's undeveloped land.&quot;    Ronald G. Moore, Molokai Ranch's president, said its board will form a special committee of &quot;disinterested&quot; directors to evaluate the offer. He expects the board to issue a recommendation to shareholders by Sept. 30.    &quot;The recommendation could be to accept the offer or to reject the offer, or the board of directors could take a position of neutrality, or the board could state its inability to take a position on the offer,&quot; the company said in a prepared statement. </TEXT></DOC>
