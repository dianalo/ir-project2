Lee (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> STY MS </CO><IN> TNM PHA </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sterling Drug Inc. disclosed financial incentives for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., its investment banker, to sell the company for more than $80 a share rather than keep it independent.    Sterling, which is fighting a $4.33 billion takeover attempt by F. Hoffmann-La Roche andamp; Co., said Morgan Stanley would be paid at least $10.6 million -- and potentially millions more -- if Sterling is sold within six months.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sterling said Morgan Stanley would receive the $10.6 million if the company were sold for $72 a share, or $4.2 billion, Hoffmann-La Roche's original tender-offer price. But Morgan Stanley would be paid $15.2 million if the company were sold for as much as $80 a share, or $4.8 billion, the filing added.    The investment banker would get an additional $1.4 million for every $1 a share paid over $80 to acquire the company. However, if Sterling Drug remains independent, Morgan Stanley won't be paid more than $10 million, the maker of drugs and household products said.    As previously reported, on Monday Hoffmann-La Roche sweetened its bid to $76 a share, after Sterling's board rejected the Swiss drug giant's initial bid as &quot;grossly inadequate and not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.&quot;    Sources close to Sterling, which has said it prefers to remain independent, said the company is likely to seek a friendly merger partner only as a last resort. The company has said it is discussing alternatives to Hoffmann-La Roche's bid with unidentified third parties.    While Morgan Stanley's fee arrangement makes it likely that a higher bid will surface for Sterling -- from either Hoffmann-La Roche or from friendly suitors -- traders said the fee structure alone doesn't mean that the company will be sold for at least $80 a share.    Sterling shares yesterday closed at $77.50, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Sterling also disclosed in the SEC filing that it entered into an agreement with a major New York bank for a $2 billion revolving credit facility to be arranged with a syndicate of banks. Sterling said the money would be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, stock repurchases and extraordinary dividends. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate.    Sterling also said that its board earlier this month authorized $15 million to $20 million in termination agreements for 44 employees not already protected if they lose their jobs in the event of a change in control of the company. Last June, the company put in place agreements totaling $9 million to $10 million for four top officials. On Monday it amended existing agreements totaling $15 million to $17 million for 20 other key employees.    Separately, Hoffmann-La Roche said in an SEC filing that if legislation passes in Delaware that would limit hostile takeovers of companies incorporated in the state, it could affect its offer for Sterling.    The legislation could prevent a stockholder owning at least 15% of a company's voting shares outstanding from effecting a merger with the company for three years unless: the board approves the merger before the stockholder accumulates 15% of the shares; or the stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock, or the merger is approved after the fact by the board and by two-thirds of the shares not owned by the stockholder.    Hoffmann-La Roche said in the filing that if such legislation passes, it could choose to challenge the law in court, purchase Sterling shares and wait for three years, or terminate the bid under terms of the offer. </TEXT></DOC>
