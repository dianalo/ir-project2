Although the total spending level was hammered out by congressional leaders and the White House in last year's budget summit, the measure contains some changes on individual weapons programs that the administration opposes.    For example, spending on President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative would be cut to $3.5 billion, down from this year's $3.6 billion and well below the $4.6 billion sought by the administration.    Also, the House bill essentially would reverse the Pentagon strategy on ground-based nuclear missiles by increasing funds for the Midgetman missile to $600 million, and reducing money for the MX missile to $100 million. The Pentagon has sought $792.9 million for the 10-warhead MX, and only $200 million for the single-warhead Midgetman, which it ultimately wants to phase out.    The House bill also would bar the Pentagon from testing possible low-trajectory intercontinental ballistic missiles so long as the Soviet Union does the same. Such missiles are viewed as first-strike, rather than retaliatory, weapons because they would hit targets in even less time than current intercontinental missiles. The ban would be lifted if U.S. intelligence reports show that the Soviets are pursuing these weapons.    The Senate hasn't completed its deliberations on a separate version of the bill. </TEXT></DOC>
