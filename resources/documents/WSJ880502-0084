Morgan andamp; Co. has given an option for 49% ownership of its new headquarters at 60 Wall St. to Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Tokyo as part of a $400 million convertible mortgage.    Morgan is expected to announce the 30-year financing today. A Morgan spokesman confirmed details of the transaction.    Unlike most other money-center banks that have sold their headquarters to raise capital, Morgan, the fifth-largest banking concern, remains the best capitalized of major U.S. banks. However, Morgan wants to free up some of its heavy investment -- $800 million -- in the new building for income-producing purposes.    By using a convertible mortgage, Morgan is able to tap some low-cost capital, use the tax benefits of the headquarters and keep a tight rein on its occupancy cost.    For Dai-ichi the option to buy gives it yet another trophy property. Last year, Citicorp sold two-thirds of Citicorp Center and part of its headquarters at 399 Park Ave. to Dai-ichi for $670 million.    Under the mortgage terms of Daiichi's U.S. affiliate, Dai-ichi Seimei America Corp., Morgan will receive the $400 million in four equal installments from this month through May 1989. The convertible mortgage will bear an interest rate for the first four years of 7% that will rise in steps at four-year intervals to 9% through 2008. </TEXT></DOC>
