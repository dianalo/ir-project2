The Zimbabwean leader told foreign ministers from theeight-nation Commonwealth Committee on South Africa that theinternational campaign for comprehensive and mandatory sanctionsaimed at ending Pretoria's legal system of racial separation must beintensified.   ``Friends, allies and sympathizers of Pretoria must be toldclearly that the Commonwealth will not allow this call to besuppressed by anyone, until South Africa is ready to dismantle herevil system,'' said Mugabe, who also is current chairman of the101-nation Non-Aligned Movement.   He was opening a three-day meeting of the Commonwealth committeeseeking ways to increase external pressure on South Africa'sgovernment and bolster black-governed neighbors threatened by SouthAfrican destabilization.   Several of South Africa's neighbors are members of the 48-memberCommonwealth, a loose association of Britain and its formercolonies. Britain is not a member of the committee because PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher opposes sanctions.   Mugabe applauded the U.S.-brokered peace plan plottingindependence for Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, afterU.N.-sponsored elections in November.   But he said African nations remain ``deeply suspicious'' of SouthAfrica's part in the agreement, which Angola and Cuba also signed,and fear attempts to weaken the U.N. role in the territory Pretoriahas administered since World War 1.   ``South Africa must never be allowed to manipulate the electionprocesses directly or indirectly in her favor. All loopholes musttherefore be closed to her,'' he said.   ``Any optimism this agreement may have generated must be temperedby anxiety about potential hurdles and land mines,'' Mugabe said.   The Zimbabwean is an outspoken critic of suggestions favored bythe five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to reducethe Namibia peacekeeping force from 7,500 to 4,650 men to save costs.   Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the United Statespay 58 percent of all peacekeeping costs.   Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal told the sessionthat reducing the force will save the five about $160 million.   This was the cost of about seven fighter aircraft or two hours ofthe collective military spending of the five major powers, Ramphalsaid.   He described the proposed cuts as an emasculation of the U.N.'srole in Nambia.   Joe Clark, Canada's external affairs minister and chairman of theCommonwealth group, said the meeting will review ways to strengthenthe international arms embargo against Pretoria, measures againstSouth Africa in world money markets and the effects of sanctions onAfrican nations dependent on South Africa for trade and transportlinks.   Other members of the committee are Australia, Guyana, India,Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
