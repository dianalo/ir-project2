Taking protectionmoney from criminals. Dealing drugs. Collecting kickbacks.Demanding bribes. This, prosecutors say, is how some municipalemployees spend their days.   The problem is as old as government and the prognosis for a cureis as bleak as ever.   ``There's always going to be people who take advantage of thesystem. Eight percent of the Apostles were corrupt, and look at whoscreened them,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney.   Maloney displayed the latest example of his thesis last week,announcing charges that 28 current and former city healthinspectors and supervisors extorted payoffs from restaurateurs bythreatening sanitary law citations.   The alleged scam may have been ``repellent and painful,'' asHealth Commissioner Stephen Joseph said, but it was notparticularly new or clever.   ``It's a classic shakedown situation,'' said Maloney.   It was just another in a long string of cases alleging municipalcorruption in the city in recent years, ranging from high officialstaking massive kickbacks to functionaries skimming or extortingcash.   ``It's pretty simple: human nature and greed,'' said KevinFrawley, the city commissioner of investigation. ``It's going aftersomething that is tempting to you, which is an easy buck.''   The local FBI chief, James M. Fox, blamed some of the temptationon the city government itself.   ``The vast majority of government workers in New York are honestand competent _ and grossly underpaid,'' Fox said. ``If you want tomaintain integrity in any profession, you must pay a living wage tothe employees. Government is not doing that today, and that is partof their problem.''   The end result: corruption that runs across the range ofgovernment activities. Among the most prominent is the case ofWedtech Corp., a military contractor accused of paying off stateand federal politicians for favored treatment. Another is theParking Violations Bureau case, in which some top city politicalleaders were convicted of taking kickbacks for contracts.   But if those lead the list, it is the litany of cases thatindicate the extent of corruption:   _In a sting operation revealed in January, state prosecutorssaid court representatives stole property from the apartments ofpeople they thought had died without family or a will.   _In October, 35 workers for a company hired by the city to emptythe cash from parking meters were accused of skimming nearly $1million in quarters.   _In July, authorities charged that guards at a city yard whereillegally parked cars are towed took bribes to release vehicles totheir owners.   _In May, nine current or former maintenance workers andsupervisors in the city school system were indicted in a nine-yearkickback scheme; 19 people were charged in 1986.   _In November 1986, prosecutors charged more than a dozen policeofficers at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn with crimes ranging fromselling cocaine to stealing garbage cans.   _In June 1986, U.S. District Judge Leonard Wexler sentenced twoformer Housing Authority officials to prison for extorting kickbackmoney. Said Wexler, ``Corruption is turning the city into acesspool.''   Frawley, the city's in-house corruption investigator, hasanother view: New York corruption is no greater than in othergovernments or in private business, he said. But in New York,grifters get caught.   ``It's a two-edged sword. You go after it vigorously, youannounce arrests. And the public perception is, `Oh, well, morecorruption,''' Frawley said. ``If you closed your eyes you wouldn'tsee it. This agency and the federal government work very hard toexpose it.''   Indeed, Frawley noted that the FBI's local office has beefed upits corruption squad and the budget for his own department hasdoubled since 1985. ``We have a number of active investigations''he said.   Just since the restaurant inspectors arrests, the FBI's New Yorkoffice has received several calls reporting graft in government,enough to persuade it to open a 24-hour hotline for corruption tipsthis week.   ``We're looking harder than we ever have,'' said Fox. ``You saythere's been a lot of cases. There are more coming.''</TEXT></DOC>
