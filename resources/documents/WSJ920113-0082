The new year's surge in smaller shares continues toattract new money into small-stock funds and leave managersgroping for reasonably priced stocks. By two small-stockmeasures -- the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000-- smaller stocks have sprinted about 5% in just the firstseven trading sessions of the year. That is on top of lastyear's 56.8% surge in the Nasdaq index, which is heavilyinfluenced by gains in big stocks, such as Microsoft andAmgen, and a smaller but still-blistering 43.7% rise in theRussell 2000, which is more representative of the small-stockuniverse.</LP><TEXT>   So where are the bargains in small stocks? Among lastyear's slowpokes, environmental and cellular stocks are onthis year's buy list for Daniel Leonard of Denver's FinancialFunds and Robert Czepiel, manager of the Robertson StephensEmerging Growth Fund. Some managers see a few bargains leftin the hot technology sector. Others are prospecting amonginitial public stock offerings that didn't take off, andamong out-of-favor &quot;value&quot; stocks that continue to lookcheap.   Digging through environmental-services stocks, FinancialFunds' Mr. Leonard finds Enclean still reasonably priced. AtFriday's close of 19, shares of the Alvin, Texas, companysell at 23 times the last 12 month's earnings and 19 timesMr. Leonard's estimated earnings of $1 a share for fiscal1992 ending in June. Still, Mr. Leonard says that is not toomuch to pay, as he expects Enclean's earnings to grow 25% ormore a year. He has similar expectations for Matrix Service,which at 25 1/2 is hovering below its 52-week high of 30 1/4.   Biotechnology stocks are too hot to touch for Mr. Czepiel;he has pared his holdings in the group to less than 2% from10% of the $290 million in stocks that he manages forRobertson Stephens andamp; Co. But Mr. Czepiel has beefed up hisinvestments in lagging cellular shares to 12% of hisholdings. He owns McCaw Cellular Communications; Contel,which is majority owned by GTE Corp.; newly public CenturyCellular; Telephone andamp; Data Systems, listed on the AmericanStock Exchange; and Century Telephone Enterprises, listed onthe New York Stock Exchange. He ranks McCaw and Telephone andamp;Data among his best bets.   Despite the recession, Mr. Czepiel notes, cellularcompanies continued to gain customers. Cowen andamp; Co. estimatesthat two million new subscribers signed on in 1991. Many ofthe companies are beginning to generate substantial operatingcash flow, or operating earnings before interest anddepreciation, Mr. Czepiel says. Falling interest rates, headds, should boost cash flow for the debt-laden cellularcompanies. He isn't concerned about competition anytime soonfrom companies developing alternative communicationtechnologies. Mobile-radio operator Fleet Call Inc., henotes, recently had to pull its initial public offering.   In the hot technology group, where pace-setters such asNovell are selling at more than 60 times the last 12 months'earnings, a few fast-growing companies still look reasonableto several technology investors.   One is Exabyte, a pick of Financial Funds' Mr. Leonard andDavid Alger of the Alger Small Capitalization Fund. Thefast-growing Boulder, Colo., company makes cartridges used toback up computer memories; its format recently was adopted asan industry standard. At Friday's close of 33 3/4, the stocksells at about 23 times Mr. Alger's estimated 1991 earningsof $1.46 a share and about 16.5 times his estimated 1992earnings of $2.04 a share.   Marcam, a maker of software for inventory control, alsoappeals to Mr. Alger. The company stumbled last year becauseof a tough product transition and the recession, but hethinks it is back on track. At Friday's close of 22, thecompany's shares sell at 34 times estimated 1992 earnings of64 cents a share and 20 times estimated 1992 earnings of$1.05.   IPOs were among the hottest areas of the small-stockmarket last year; many new issues soared as soon as they wentpublic. Some of the IPOs that stumbled may be worth a secondlook, managers say, but they caution that fallen IPOs can bea mine field.   Among the lackluster IPOs that didn't take off last year,RehabCare appeals to John Ballen of MFS Lifeline EmergingGrowth Fund. RehabCare, a St. Louis operator ofrehabilitation facilities, tumbled from its $13-a-shareoffering price after its lead underwriter warned ofhigher-than-expected labor costs and start-up expensesrelated to a joint venture with Beverly Enterprises.   But Mr. Ballen, a RehabCare shareholder, expects that thecompany will control costs. He notes that the company'srevenue is on target, and he is optimistic about itsagreement to run a nationwide network of programs inBeverly's nursing homes. At 10 1/4, the stock sells at about16 times estimated earnings of 60 cents a share for 1992ending in February.   When Alliance Imaging fell to 5 from its offering price of$8.50 a share, Walter Kass of Curators Capital Managementtripled his holdings in the La Palma, Calif., provider ofmagnetic resonance imaging machines for hospitals. Alliance,which cut its original offering price, stumbled afterretiring less debt than expected and after some orders weredelayed; they have since come through. Now back at 8 1/2, thestock is trading at about 26 estimated 1991 earnings of 32cents a share. While not cheap on an earnings basis, thestock's $2-a-share in operating cash flow makes Mr. Kass seeit as a bargain.   &quot;Value&quot; investors revel in shunned stocks that are cheaprelative to their book value, earnings and other measures.The book value is assets minus liabilities. But the valuecrowd has been badly outgunned by growth-stock funds. KenFisher of Fisher Investments of Woodside, Calif., figures theday will arrive when undervalued stocks such as Pool EnergyServices will race ahead. Hovering near its 52-week low, thestock of the oil field service company trades at about 16times the last 12 months' earnings; the company has no debt,strong cash flow and, Mr. Kass says, is poised for a recoveryin the oil patch.   Despite the slowdown in California's economy, Mr. Fisherexpects that health maintenance organization FHPInternational, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., will keepgaining market share. Its shares are a bargain, he says, at12 times the last 12 months' earnings and less than two timesbook value.   ---                   Small-Stock Bargains                                                                                                          VALUE                                                                                                          Pool Energy Services                   6 5/8   FHP International                     15 3/4                                                                                                          LACKLUSTER IPOs                                                                                                          RehabCare                             10 1/4   Alliance Imaging                       8 1/4                                                                                                          CELLULAR                                                                                                          McCaw Cellular Comm.                  34 1/8   Telephone andamp; Data                      36 1/8                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Exabyte                               33 3/4   Marcam                                22   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks snapped their record-breakingwinning streak as investors pocketed their profits amid fearsof rising interest rates.   The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 4.10 to 615.70, or0.66%, as OTC volume dropped to 259.4 million shares fromThursday's record 327.8 million shares. Declining sharesedged out advancers 1,196 to 1,044, but 203 stocks reachedhighs as only 13 fell to new lows.

Pioneer Hi-Bred dropped 2 to 70 1/4. The company reporteda loss of $1.10 a share for the first quarter ended Nov. 30,compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.23 a share.

H.B. Fuller jumped 3 1/4 to 67 1/2 after the companyreported that net income for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30rose to 95 cents a share from 88 cents a share a yearearlier.
