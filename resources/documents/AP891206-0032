Dr. James Enstrom, who studied the habits of religiously activeMormons in California, said his research shows those who follow thechurch's teachings against using tobacco and who exercise and getseven to eight hours sleep a night are far healthier than people inthe general white population.   ``We knew from previous studies of Mormon death records thatthis population has an unusually low cancer mortality rate that isonly partially explained by their lack of smoking,'' said Enstrom,of the University of California, Los Angeles. ``The current studyallowed us to follow a large group of active Mormons over a longperiod of time and to examine subgroups adhering to specific healthhabits.''   The study examined three general health habits: never smokingcigarettes, regular physical exercise and regular sleep.   The males involved in the study were all high priests, thehighest lay position in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-daySaints. The women were wives of high priests.   That particular group was selected, Enstrom said, because itsmembers would be more likely than other Mormons to strictly adhereto church doctrine banning alcohol, tobacco and caffeine use.   The study found that middle-age high priests who didn't smokeand who exercised and slept well had 34 percent the rate of cancermortality as middled-aged white men in the United States. The highpriests also had only 14 percent the rate of cardiovascular diseasemortality and 22 percent the rate of overall mortality, Enstrom said   Middle-age wives of high priests who followed the same healthhabits had only a 55 percent rate of cancer death compared tomiddle-aged white women, Enstrom said. They had a 34 percent rateof cardiovascular disease mortality and a 47 percent rate ofoverall mortality.   Further, a 25-year-old high priest can expect to live to age 85,compared with a life expectancy of 74 for 25-year-old white males,Enstrom said.   A 25-year-old high priest wife has a life expectancy of 86years, compared with 80 for other white 25-year-old females,Enstrom said.   The results of the survey, conducted at the UCLA School ofPublic Health, were to be published in the December issue of theJournal of the National Cancer Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
