(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MORE VENDORS, USERS LURED TO VAX PROJECT MANAGEMENTandM;Buyers of VAX-based project management software can thank their lucky Ganttcharts.andP;  In many software markets, the big growth comes first and foremost toPC-based products.andP;  Not so here.andM;The move of many organizations to tap the power of their existing VAXes, plusthe greater processing speed and capabilities of minicomputer packages, hasprompted vendors to generate a broad range of VAC project managementproducts.andM;Buyers will find familiar PC vendors such as Applied Management Methods,Bechtel Software and Computerline beginning to roll out new VAX projectmanagement products.andM;On the other hand, almost one-third of the nearly 30 VAX products are alsoavailable in PC versions.andP;  Established VAX project management softwarevendors, meanwhile, are offering increasingly sophisticated choices.andM;&quot;The bare-bones products are essentially gone,&quot; said Harvey A. Levine,president of Project Knowledge Group, a project management consulting companyin Clifton Park, N.Y.andP;  &quot;I think people are going to have their cake and eatit too.&quot;andM;Vendors and analysts say VAX project management packages offer greater speedand capabilities than comparable PC software.andP;  (See &quot;Picking PCs vs.andP;  VAXes&quot;at left.)andP;  VAX project management packages, they say, allow users at eachlevel within company management to generate, access and update projectplans--the lifeblood of high-tech enterprises.andM;VAX project management packages are increasingly being aimed at specificindustries, such as financial, pharmaceutical, construction and defense.andP;  Thetrend toward graphic presentation of information also continues, and the PCinfluence can be seen in user interfaces that blend simple graphicalinterfaces, menus and help screens.andM;VAX-based project management packages share a number of common features.andP;  Forstarters, all of the packages can be used interactively.andP;  Each also providesmost or all of the project management basics: scheduling, resourcemanagement, cost control, performance measurement and graphics capabilities.andM;Vendors also offer varying types of user training and technical support, bothof which are essential springboards to implementing any project managementpackage effectively.andP;  Because project management packages can prove difficultto learn, on-line help is also virtually essential.andP;  Only one VAXpackage--Mitchell Management Systems' MAPPS--doesn't include the capability.andM;Most packages accommodate alphanumeric activity codes and resourceidentifiers (a few handle only numeric codes and identifiers), and allprovide activity description fields.andP;  Packages targeted toward high-end VAXesoften provide automatic resource leveling, which helps project managersspread out the usage of costly resources such as labor.andP;  In addition, mostpackages include a report writer and a calendar that includes holidays andlets users modify activity dates, and all the products can sort codes inascending or descending order.andM;The report writers, important elements of any project progress reports.andO;Report data might include estimated and actual finishes, remaining durationsand durations completed, and percentages completed.andM;Progress reports may include a variety of chart types, depending on eachpackage's particular capabilities.andP;  Many packages include basic integralgraphics capabilities such as network, bar, logic bar and tabular charts, aswell as histograms and S-curves.andM;Some packages allow users to generate Gantt charts--sophisticated bar graphsthat plot the duration of an activity on a time scale--and program evaluationand review technique (PERT) charts, which show the relationships betweentasks.andP;  PERT charts resemble organizational charts that illustrate tasks in ahierarchical order.andM;Application integration hasn't fully infiltrated the project managementworld.andP;  Most packages don't provide query links to database managementsystems, for instance, and only a few other interfaces to businessapplications such as accounting or graphics packages.andM;Project management vendors are striving to make their packages simpler andmore accessible for end users.andP;  All packages are menu-oriented, and some alsoprovide command modes for veteran users who want speedy function access.andP;  Theeasier interfaces let managers analyze project progress faster, said JoelLockwood, a product marketing manager for Computer Associates International(CAI).andP;  &quot;You want the manager to run the project and not the projectmanagement software,&quot; he explained.andM;Many VAX project management software vendors are beginning to providegraphical user interfaces.andP;  Project Knowledge's Levine predicts that graphicinterfaces will become extremely important in project management.andP;  &quot;More andmore [project management] packages are doing to operate this way,&quot; Levinesaid.andM;While there are many features from which to choose, buyers frequently do notneed every capability, said Brad Friedlander, a consultant with Arthur D.andO;Little, a research and development company in Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;Figure out what you expect the package to do for you,&quot; Friedlander said.andO;&quot;Define your requirements first and find a package that best fits them.andO;Don't get derailed by all the gee-whiz features.andP;  &quot;I guess it's acold-hearted perspective, but when it comes right down to it, it's amanagement tool.&quot;andM;Like any project, selecting a project management system requires carefulplanning.andP;  Project Knowledge's Levine said the process should involve threebasic steps: a search methodology, selecting the project management package,and then training personnel to implement the system.andM;STARTING THE SEARCHandM;Levine suggested that buyers begin their search process by establishing acommittee to describe and analyze the current inhouse systems that manageprojects.andP;  Armed with the information, he said, the committee can look for anautomated system that matches the old project management methods closelyenough to allow for an orderly transition.andM;Last, Levine urges managers to rally support for the new project managementsoftware.andP;  Arguably the worst buying method is to force a new projectmanagement package on unwilling users.andP;  Lackluster managerial support orinadequate training can lead to project failures, Levine warned.andM;Project management consultants advise buyers to make sure vendors can provideextensive user training, and also recommend that overtime compensation beprovided for users devoting extra hours to mastering the project managementtool.andM;Primavera systems Product Manager Diane Dempster asserted that companies needto dedicate themselves to successfully implementing their project managementpackages.andP;  &quot;It has to be a company willing to spend time in learning howproject management is done,&quot; she said.andM;Liz Harshyne, marketing director for AGS Management Systems, said that endusers are often skeptical about, and wary of, automated project managementtools.andP;  &quot;Project management makes people visible, and a lot of people don'twant [that visibility],&quot; she said.andM;Since 1987, when many VAX project management packages debuted, prices haveremained fairly constant in the range of $9,000 to $190,000.andP;  In addition tovarying according to specific VAXes and number of users, prices often reflectthe number of activies per project a package can handle.andM;Buyers should note that software sometimes represents only a portion of thecost of fully implementing a project management system.andP;  User training andsupport costs--and hardware purchases, if new CPUs are needed--are hidden butmajor additional costs.andM;Many analysts stressed, however, that price should not be a buyer's chiefdeciding factor.andM;There could be long-term negative--even disastrous--consequences forcompanies opting for packages that are less expensive but inappropriate fortheir particular applications.andP;  In fact, the analysts said, once a properlyselected package is fully implemented, it should pay for itself many timesover.andM;Growth potential for VAX project management software is quite high.andM;According to Computer Intelligence, a market research company in La Jolla,Calif., project management systems have found their way into only 1 percentof all U.S.andP;  VAX and MicroVAX sites, with Computer Associates International,Project Software andamp; Development and Systonetics respectively occupying thethree top-selling positions.andM;&quot;I don't think it [has] reached the expectations people had for it,&quot; ProjectKnowledge's Levine said.andM;But many vendors and market analysts contend that project management packageshave the potential of becoming common business applications.andP;  &quot;I think seniormanagement is starting to recognize the benefits of project management,&quot;CAI's Lockwood said.andP;  &quot;I think senior management wants to know what's goingon [with projects].andP;  Boardrooms want to see Gantt charts.&quot;andM;Project management vendors are pursuing increased sales by targettingspecific application areas.andM;A new product from K andamp; H Professional Management Services, for instance, isdesigned to help defense contractors meet new federalstandards--Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC)--that wereestablished to help control defense project costs.andM;Similarly, Metier Management Systems, PSDI and Shirley Software Systems areamong the growing number of vendors who encourage buyers to use their projectmanagement packages to create public- or private-sector contract proposals.andM;According to AGS Management Systems' Harshyne, the company's VAX-basedproject management systems, Pac III and Wings, are selling particularly wellin data processing environments.andP;  The packages, each equipped with adifferent scheduling system, have also been used for construction,engineering and computer-aided software engineering, Harshyne said.andM;Primavera Systems' Dempster reported that banking, manufacturing andconstruction customers have boosted Primavera Project Planner sales, andadded that software developers and MIS departments are also beginning toinvest in the Primavera package.andM;The improved power of PCs and workstations has brought considerablecompetition for VAX-based project management packages, which costconsiderably more than their PC counterparts.andM;Buyers continue to express interest in VAX project management software,Project Knowledge's Levine said, but they aren't stampeding to purchase theproducts.andP;  Both IBM and DEC hardware platforms &quot;are seeing a lot of [projectmanagement] activity,&quot; Levine said, &quot;but it's not like what we're seeing onmicrocomputers.&quot;andM;Levine noted that the VAX market remains more secure for project managementvendors than any other minicomputer vendor platforms, and expects shakeoutsto thin the ranks of mainframe-oriented project management vendors.andM;&quot;A lot of mainframe [project management] companies are in a fight for theirlives,&quot; he said.andM;For their part, project management vendors remain bullish about the DECmarket, and continue to produce new VAX project management products.andM;Cincom Systems, for instance, recently introduced the Cincom Project ControlSystem (CPCS).andP;  Written using Cincom's Mantis 4GL and priced from $10,900 to$94,100, the software is clearly targeted toward project managementapplications that need plenty of CPU horsepower.andM;&quot;[CPCS] is flavored toward MIS, but that is not to say a construction companycouldn't use it,&quot; said Dale Shiffman, Cincom's associate product manager forCPCS.andM;From aerospace, defense and other contractors seeking federal projects toprivate-sector industrial plants, land development firms, oil, gas andsynthetic fuel producers and the like, VAX project management packages aresaving time and money.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
