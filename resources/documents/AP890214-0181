Some are reporting small increases in wage pressure, which hasbeen at minimal levels through most of the six-year-old economicexpansion. Plans to raise prices are on a sharp ascent. Actual priceincreases are rising also.   The evidence is contained in the latest quarterly economic surveyof small and independent businesses, ranging from proprietorships tocompanies that just fail to make listings of the 1,000 largestcompanies.   The survey, conducted by the National Federation of IndependentBusiness, ``shows the worst set of inflation numbers in theexpansion,'' said economist William C. Dunkelberg, who analyzes andinterprets the data.   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business andmanagement, said first-quarter plans to raise prices jumped 5percentage points from fourth-quarter levels to 30 percent of allcompanies in the survey.   The latest percentage contrasts with only 19 percent in July1986. Levels in some categories were even higher _ 38 percent amongwholesalers, followed by manufacturing at 37 percent andprofessional service firms at 36 percent.   Actual price increases rose to 29 percent, indicating thatcompanies were following through on plans. Although that percentagewas exceeded briefly early in 1988, Dunkelberg pointed out that itwas close to the highest since 1981.   The data, gathered from more than 2,000 written responses fromthe 500,000 business members of the federation, led Dunkelberg toconclude that ``Although not rampant, the pace of price increasesclearly continues to gain momentum.''   He said overall price increases in the general economy once againmay be held down by falling oil prices, but that ``without energy orfood prices declines, 1989's inflation rate will clearly be abovethe 1988 experience.''   He estimated the first-quarter inflation level would measureabout 4.9 percent on an annual basis, compared with a 1988 increasein the consumer price index of 4.4 percent.   In spite of some evidence of rising wages, Dunkelberg said,``there is no evidence that gains are `alarming.''' He added,however, that as inflation rose labor would demand larger wageincreases, ``which they feel can be funded out of the ratherimpressive earnings being posted by many of our companies.''   He said employment of the over-16 population is at record highlevels, and that small-firm job openings are at their highest forthe more than six years of expansion. ``Multiple job holding isbecoming quite common,'' he said.   Overall, the small business optimism index, made up of suchfactors as expected business conditions, current job openings,expected credit conditions, and expected sales volume, barelychanged from the fourth quarter of 1988.   The index, adjusted to eliminate seasonal variations, reached102.8 early in the first quarter, compared with 102.9 in theprevious quarterly measurement in October 1988. It is based on theyear 1978 equally 100.   The index, begun in the fourth quarter of 1974, reached itshighest point, 108.7, in the first quarter of 1984, rising from theall-time low of 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980. Since 1984, theindex has dipped no lower than 99.5.   An important factor in helping the index retain strength wereviews on the economic outlook. Twenty-two percent said theyanticipated an improved economy in the next six months, up 3percentage points from the earlier quarter.   At the same time, negative views shrank. Only 12 percent saidthey expected business conditions to deteriorate in the first halfof the year, a four-point decline from the final quarter of 1988.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday., Feb. 15.</NOTE></DOC>
