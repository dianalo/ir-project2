The United States said its forcesmistook the jet for a warplane.   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said the incident showedthat the U.S. had ``entered a more direct war with our nation,''and he warned it must face the consequences of ``this criminalact.''   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Airjet was hit by two American missiles minutes after leaving Iran forDubai in the United Arab Emirates. All the passengers were believedkilled after the plane ``exploded in the sky'' at an altitude of7,500 feet, IRNA said. The report was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.   Iranian television showed helicopters shooting flares across thecrash area and small motor boats moving in to pick up floatingcorpses. It said 110 had been recovered.   A camera zeroed in on a rescue ship. On the ship's deck, arescue worker held up the corpse of an infant shook his fist.   The report said the victims included 66 children. Iran declaredJuly 4 a day of mourning.   President Reagan said the shooting occurred during ``properdefensive action'' after the jet headed for the USS Vincennes asthe ship was engaged in a battle with Iranian gunboats in theStrait of Hormuz, the entryway to the gulf. He promised a fullinvestigation.   ``We deeply regret any loss of life,'' Reagan said from CampDavid.   Musavi warned the United States ``that its latest crime againstthe Iranian people would only further arouse the abhorrence of(Iranians) against Washington,'' according to IRNA.   The report did not say what actions Iran might take. It said theshooting would strengthen Iranian resolve to continue its war withIraq.   Iraq had no immediate comment on the incident.   IRNA said ``eyewitnesses on Hengham island and Iranian militaryforces in the Persian Gulf all clearly saw the passenger plane hitby two surface-to-air missiles fired by the American warships.''   The jet, Iran Air flight 655, was on a routine 150-mile flightbetween Iran's coastal city of Bandar Abbas and Dubai, across thegulf in the United Arab Emirates, IRNA said.   The gulf air corridor is one of the world's busiest, despite thehazards of flying over the waterway where Iran and Iraq have beenat war for nearly eight years.   IRNA said the jet left Bandar Abbas at 10:15 a.m. (2:45 a.m.EDT) and crashed at 10:30 a.m. The casualty toll of 290 would makeit the sixth-worst commercial air crash in history.   The Pentagon said the gulf skirmish began at 2:10 a.m. when thecruiser Vincennes and the frigate Elmer Montgomery encounteredIranian patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz. The Elmer Montgomeryhad been involved in an encounter with Iranian gunboats Saturdaynight.   Iran claimed its naval forces shot down an American helicopterand that two Iranians were missing, in addition to those killed inthe air crash. U.S. sources in the gulf said an American helicopterwas fired upon, but they did not acknowledge Iran's claim that itwas shot down.   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,emphasized that the American troops ``acted with good judgment.''   He told reporters at the Pentagon that the American ships firedonly after sending warnings to the incoming aircraft. The missilethat hit the jet came from the Vincennes, he said.   Crowe said the Vincennes crew believed it was firing at anIranian F-14 fighter jet.   ``How could a sophisticated warship like the Vincennes mistakean airliner for a military jet? That's the question thateverybody's asking,'' said one military source in the gulf, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The 9,600-ton Vincennes, the first of the Navy's billion-dollar,super-powerful Aegis-type cruisers to be assigned to gulf duty, hasbeen on patrol in the Hormuz area for the past month. It isequipped with an array of missiles including the SM-2 Standard, apotent, long-range anti-aircraft weapon.   The incident underscored the danger faced by U.S. warships inthe gulf.   On May 17, 1987, the U.S. frigate Stark was hit in the gulf by amissile fired by an Iraqi warplane, and 37 crew members died. Iraqsaid the attack was a mistake, and Reagan said at that time thatsuch a mistake ``must never be repeated.''   The incident also evoked memories of the Sept. 1, 1983 incidentin which a Soviet fighter shot down a South Korean airliner with269 people aboard after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All aboardwere killed.   In addition, Israel destroyed a Libyan Arab Airlines jet overthe then-occupied Sinai desert on Feb. 21, 1973, killing 106 of the113 people on board.   The U.S. policy in the gulf was recently expanded to allowAmerican warships to aid tankers of any flag that come under attackand ask for help. It used that new power for the first time lateSaturday, when the Elmer Montgomery came to the aid of a Danishsupertanker under attack by three Iranian speedboats.   The officials said there were no American casualties in Sunday'sclash, the second major one between U.S. and Iranian forces in thegulf in three months.   On April 18, American warships and planes, retaliating for themining of a U.S. missile frigate, destroyed two Iranian oil rigsand sank or disabled six of Iran's naval craft, including two ofits best frigates.</TEXT></DOC>
