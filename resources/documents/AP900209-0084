The program, co-anchored by Harry Smith, made no mention todaythat she is leaving. Sullivan did not say anything about it on theair. Terry Everett, a CBS News spokeswoman, said today that thenetwork ``can't confirm or deny'' reports that she is leaving.   The anchorwoman, whose CBS contract expires in November, did herpart of today's show from Atlanta. Everett said the anchorwoman hadgone there on personal business.   Scanlon said no decision has been made yet on when Sullivan willleave ``CBS This Morning,'' but that she will help the transitionprocess and ``is looking forward to discussing other possibilitiesat CBS.''   There have been reports that her successor will be Paula Zahn,anchorwoman of ABC's ``World News This Morning.'' Sullivanco-anchored that program and news segments of ABC's ``Good MorningAmerica'' before joining CBS News in 1987.   ``We have no comment at this point,'' said ABC spokesman ScottRichardson when asked if Zahn may be leaving ABC for CBS.   ``CBS This Morning'' has consistently trailed ``Good MorningAmerica'' and NBC's ``Today'' in the ratings. The latter programwas in the headlines last fall when it became known that JanePauley, the show's co-anchor for 13 years, would be succeeded byDeborah Norvile.   Norville began her new job in January.   In October, during an appearance with Pauley on the ``Donahue''syndicated talk show, Sullivan said she would be fired if hershow's ratings didn't improve.   The month before, she riled CBS executives when, while speakinginto a microphone she didn't know was live, she joked that CBSstood for ``Cheap Broadcasting Service.'' The comment was heard onCBS' closed-circuit television system, but was not broadcast overthe air.</TEXT></DOC>
