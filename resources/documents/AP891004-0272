The BLSA, a component of the National Institute on Aging in theNational Institutes of Health, was founded in 1958 by Dr. Nathan W.Shock, regarded as the founder of modern research on aging. Hestarted the first NIH section on gerontology in 1941 at BaltimoreCity Hospital.   ``Dr. Shock wanted to measure such things as the rate ofaging,'' said Fozard. ``As it turns out, this hope sort ofdisintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specificquestions.''   BLSA researchers have studied aging's effects on more than 1,800people, who are given physical examinations. Tests are done eachvisit on all of the organ systems, the condition of the blood,muscles, bones, hearing and vision. Electrocardiograms and testsusing radiation are given less frequently.   Volunteers also are tested on their memory, reasoning andproblem-solving abilities, intelligence and personality, a historyof each person's aging that is used in more than 50 studies underway as part of the overall project.   Among the findings is that ``there is no single biologicalmaster clock which drives all of the physiological aging that wesee,'' Fozard said.   Volunteers pay their own way to Baltimore and spend more thantwo days every 2{ years undergoing as many as 103 medical andbehavioral tests. ``I know of no other study that makes that kindof demand,'' he said. ``We ask them for a lifetime'' of commitment,and many agree to be autopsied after they die.   The study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here,as well as for the tests, which could total $4,000 at a doctor'soffice or hospital.   The volunteers range in age from 20 to 97. Sixty-five percentare men, 70 percent are college educated, and half of those haveadvanced degrees. Most are middle- or upper-middle-class and only 5percent are black.   ``In some of the studies the social class definitely makes adifference,'' Fozard said. ``In that sense, the study may not be asrepresentative'' as one with a more varied sample. But ``when youcompare all types of biological results, these things don't varymuch on social class.''   Scientists who use data from the BLSA say the racial and socialstructure of the study is one of its weaknesses.   ``In an ideal world, we'd have it truly representative of allgroups in the United States,'' said Dr. Hugh Taylor at the WilmerEye Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital. ``But you have to berealistic. There is a variety of people there and everybody isgoing to die. Everybody gets old.''   Researchers say the study's history explains its sociologicalprofile.   The first subject, Dr. William Wesley Peter, recruitedparticipants from among family and friends, a practice thatcontinues among volunteers today.   The study has a waiting list of about 1,000 people, andresearchers have not made an effort to broaden its base, Fozardsaid.   Paul Kirby's grandfather volunteered shortly after the studybegan. Since then, Kirby, 40, of Glenwood, Md., his father, brotherand three sisters became involved. His wife, Pamela, and a sister'shusband also have volunteered.   The involvement of nine members of a single family could helpthe BLSA determine whether heredity determines aging, Kirby said.``If they can see a trend in different generations of a family,they might find a genetic link.''   That genetic link still has scientists baffled, Fozard said.``We are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle onthe genetic component of aging. We think there are only a few genesinvolved with aging, but where they are and what they are is stilla mystery.''   Kenneth J. Nicholson, 86, of Mesa, Ariz., joined the study in1960. He recently completed his 13th checkup for the study, whichhe said has ``made me more cognizant of aging and the agingpopulation.''   Nicholson said he also has modified his diet and made otherchanges in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned duringhis visit.   Information on any medical problem detected is given to thevolunteers, and their family physicians are notified so treatmentcan be prescribed.   ``The longer I have cooperated, the more they are providinginformation to us,'' Nicholson said. ``They give me good advice andthat is very helpful.''   Fifteen scientists work with the BLSA full-time, Fozard said. Asmany as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically throughagreements with universities around the country. The study has anannual budget of about $3 million.   Volunteers say the BLSA's impact on society is enormous.   ``The longer it can run, the more value they will get out ofit,'' said Nicholson. ``I would certainly hate to see it stopped.''</TEXT></DOC>
