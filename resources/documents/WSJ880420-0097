In the year-earlier period, the nation's No. 1 aluminum producer earned $49.5 million, or 56 cents a share.    The latest results, largely the result of higher prices, surprised Wall Street anaylsts, who on average predicted that Alcoa would report net income of $1.35 a share. In fact, most analysts found themselves boosting Alcoa's earnings estimate for the year, in some cases more than a dollar a share.    In general, aluminum industry earnings were anticipated to be sharply higher for the quarter. Already this week, Oakland, Calif.-based KaiserTech Ltd. posted an operating profit compared with a year-earlier operating loss. And just yesterday, Alcan Aluminium Ltd., Montreal, showed net income of $175 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with $71 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Reynolds Metals Co. probably will report today.    But analysts said that it appears Alcoa will emerge with the strongest numbers. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the company's shares closed yesterday at $46.50, up $3.    &quot;The difference is the realization of an improvement in prices,&quot; said Stewart Spector, who tracks Alcoa for Furman, Selz, Mager, Dietz andamp; Birney. He raised his own 1988 earnings estimate for the company to $9 a share from $8. Alcoa, for instance, said its rollback of a series of discounts on can sheet, its largest volume product, is holding steady.    The company's shipments of aluminum goods rose on a year-to-year basis only 1.7%-to 536,000 metric tons from 527,000but revenue jumped 18% to $2.1 billion from $1.78 billion.    The surge in revenue reflected, in part, a change in accounting methods, known as consolidation. The technical alteration, undertaken so that Alcoa's aluminum-producing subsidiaries are more clearly portrayed on the balance sheet, didn't affect bottom-line profit.    But it did alter the mix of products included in the line-item for revenue. And because about twice as much aluminium ingot is now part of that mix -- and the price of ingot soared more than any other Alcoa product during the quarter -- it helped revenue climb substantially.    &quot;Alcoa's fundamentals remain strong world-wide,&quot; Chairman Paul O'Neill said in a statement. Mr. O'Neill, who has said he will focus attention squarely on developing aluminum products and stay away from diversifying, also cited &quot;better facility utilization and efficiency improvements.&quot;    Analysts concurred, noting that Alcoa -- a net buyer of raw metal -- had higher prices of its own to absorb in the first quarter. The company also had foreign currency losses, mostly from translation, of $21.2 million, compared with losses of $14.5 million in 1987. &quot;There had to be improved efficiency throughout the system,&quot; Mr. Spector asserted.    Meanwhile, Alcan's profit was a record for any quarter. Revenue rose 28% to $1.97 billion from $1.54 billion, although the volume of aluminum shipments rose only 7% to 556,000 metric tons from 519,000 metric tons.    Ingot shipments increased 4.2% to 208,000 metric tons from 200,000 metric tons while fabricated product shipments jumped 8.8% to 356,000 metric tons from 327,000 metric tons.    The per-share figures reflect a 3-for-2 stock split last May.    Alcan said that the strong earnings reflect its recent cost-cutting efforts as well as higher aluminum prices. </TEXT></DOC>
