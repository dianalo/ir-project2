Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his governing Christian Democratswould have to ``take care of conservative voters'' who defected.   The conservative Republican Party captured 11 of the West Berlinlegislature's 138 seats in Sunday's balloting. It also will have twoseats in the federal parliament in Bonn after next year's nationalelections, giving the ultra-right its first representation inparliament since 1953.   Police said more than 10,000 people demonstrated in downtown WestBerlin late Monday to protest the Republicans' showing. There wereisolated rock- throwing incidents and vandalism, but no violence orarrests, they said.   The Republicans, guided by former Nazi SS soldier FranzSchoenhuber, campaigned on a platform of ridding West Berlin offoreign workers such as Turks and giving preferential treatment toGermans seeking jobs.   Foreigners make up more than 10 percent of the city's populationof 2.1 million.   West Germany also has been the destination of many asylum-seekersfrom the Third World, and the Republicans called for sharp limits ontheir numbers.   Sunday's balloting marked the first time the Republican Party,formed in 1983, won elective seats at the state level. Schoenhuber,whose party headquarters are in Munich, did not run.   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper called thevictories ``frightening.'' West German Jewish leader Heinz Galinksisaid they were a ``heavy defeat for democracy.''   However, Greens Party leader Antje Vollmer said the Republicans'``good showing ... is a challenge, but it won't kill democracy.''   Thousands of people chanted ``Kick out the Nazis! Foreignersstay!'' in a march through West Berlin late Sunday in protest of theparty.   Kohl said told reporters in Bonn the party's showing wasworrisome and indicated West Germans are increasingly concernedabout the growing number of foreigners competing for jobs, housingand social services.   ``There is an urgent need to discuss these problems and come upwith better solutions,'' Kohl said. He also said ``reasonablesolutions'' had to be found for the large number of asylum-seekers.   Kohl added that Christian Democrats would not work with theRepublicans. ``The Republicans are no partners of ours,'' he said.   Eberhard Diepgen, a Christian Democrat and mayor of West Berlin,called the elections a ``bitter loss'' and said support for theultra-right poses a serious challenge for the nation's mainstreampolitical parties.   Some conservative lawmakers said they thought their ranks haddrifted too far to the left.   Theo Waigel, head of the Christian Social Union, told West GermanTV that the Christian Democrats ``must pay more attention to thenational-conservative spectrum of voters.''   Juergen Todenhoefer, a Christian Democratic member of parliament,charged that his party had been moving toward the left.   Heiner Geissler, general secretary of the party, said thestrength of the far-left and the ultra-right in Berlin aided theRepublican showing.   ``It's like a scissors movement similar to what happened in theWeimar Republic'' that preceded the Nazi era, he said. ``Theradicals from the left and the right pick up support and constrictthe democratic middle.''   Karl Dietrich Bracher, a prominent West German historian, playeddown the comparison with the short-lived Weimar Republic.   ``You cannot seriously compare the two,'' he told The AssociatedPress in an interview in his Bonn office. ``We have no economiccrisis now, and the Nazi past is itself a control on the growth ofnationalism.''   He said Sunday's results were ``a reaction to the left, which isespecially strong in Berlin.''   The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote, according to nearlycomplete official returns.   The Christian Democrats won 38 percent of the vote and 55 seats,losing 12 seats from the last election four years ago. The FreeDemocrats, who ruled in a coalition with the Christian Democratics,lost all 12 of their seats by failing to muster the 5 percent of thevote necessary for representation.   The Social Democrats won 37 percent of the vote for 55 seats andthe left-wing Alternative List party won 17 seats with a 12 percentshowing, a gain of two seats.   Kohl said the Christian Democrats planned to form a coalitiongovernment with the left-of-center Social Democrats.   West Berlin is a separate state of West Germany surrounded byEast German territory. It was formed from Western zones of Berlinoccupied by the Allied forces in World War II.   West Berlin's 22-member delegation in the federal parliament canvote in committee but has very limited voting rights in fullsessions.</TEXT></DOC>
