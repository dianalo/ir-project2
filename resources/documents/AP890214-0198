The rules, some of which went into effect Monday, are the firstmajor changes in the way trading is conducted in London since ``BigBang,'' the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial markets. Theexchange has made minor variations in the past two years.   Under the latest changes, investment firms that make markets inBritish shares would no longer be required to trade with each other.   Market makers formerly had to trade with clients, agency brokersand other market makers at the prices and volumes they quoted on theexchange's trading system, called Stock Exchange AutomatedQuotation. But they complained that other market makers dumped stockon them.   Among the other changes, details of large trades, about $175,000or more, will be publicly reported the following day instead ofwithin minutes. That rule goes into effect within two weeks.   The exchange's 25-member council approved the rule changes onJan. 9.   ``It's to improve the liquidity of the marketplace,'' said anexchange spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance withBritish practice.   ``Some market makers were no longer prepared to offer largevolume quotations because they felt that other market makers weresimply taking advantage of them without reciprocating the deal.''   Since Big Bang many firms have suffered big losses because of thefierce competition and because the volume of trading dropped sharplyafter the October 1987 stock market crash.   Under Big Bang _ the bulk of which took place Oct. 27, 1986 _brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks, an activitypreviously restricted to firms called ``jobbers.''</TEXT></DOC>
