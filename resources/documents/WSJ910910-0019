Prices may have fallen even further if there had not beenadditional evidence yesterday of an apparent rift shaping upbetween Iran and Saudi Arabia over fourth-quarter productionlevels for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</LP><TEXT>   As a result of the differences between the two largePersian Gulf producers, &quot;there is concern about the OPECmeeting coming up Sept. 24&quot; that may be holding a floor underoil prices, said John Hill, a vice president with MerrillLynch's energy trading desk.   Still, on London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brentblend crude oil futures declined as much as 34 cents a barrelyesterday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil forOctober delivery was down 24 cents to settle at $21.33 abarrel.   On the supply side, oil analysts and traders cited theincreased possibility of a larger-than-expected sale of Iraqicrude oil. There have been indications that Iraq may beallowed by the United Nations Security Council to export moreoil for humanitarian reasons than the $1.6 billion initiallyproposed.   Meanwhile, however, Iran's oil minister, GholamrezaAgazadeh, was quoted by the authoritative Middle EastEconomic Survey as saying that the average price of the OPECbasket of seven crudes should rise to the $21 target beforethere is any further increase in individual production levelsof the 13 member nations. Currently, the OPEC basket averagesslightly more than $19 a barrel.   Mr. Agazadeh cited the July 1990 agreement by the oilministers, which established a mechanism for raising bothprices and production when demand rose for OPEC's oil. &quot;Priorto any increase in the production ceiling, the price shouldadvance to the $21 target, and the July 1990 resolutiondoesn't allow us any room for maneuver in this regard,&quot; theIranian minister was quoted as saying.   The formerly frigid relations between Iran and SaudiArabia have been warming since the Persian Gulf War ended.But the Iranian call for holding down OPEC output in thefourth quarter is apparently contrary to Saudi wishes.   According to the word leaked out of Saudi Arabia lately,it will press for a higher OPEC production ceiling at theSeptember meeting. That is because the kingdom wants to boostits own quota to 8.5 million barrels a day from its voluntarylevel of eight million.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Rumors of grain purchases by theSoviet Union counterbalanced state reports showingimprovement in the U.S. corn and soybean crops to keep grainfutures prices stable. The U.S. Agriculture Departmentannounced yesterday that the U.S.S.R. had arranged financingto buy 100,000 metric tons of corn. The rumor mill had thetotal purchase higher, at about 500,000 metric tons of cornplus an unspecified quantity of soybean meal. Using U.S.credit guarantees, the Soviets managed to get privatefinancing for grain despite widespread skepticism of thecountry's credit-worthiness. The source of the loans wasunclear. State reports released yesterday showed improvementin the condition of crops in grain-growing Midwest states.Volume of grain futures trading was light yesterday and islikely to remain that way throughout the week because ofJewish religious holidays and a major Agriculture Departmentcrop report due out Thursday. Most analysts are looking for aslight reduction in corn and soybean yields in the report.One exception is AgResource Co., Chicago, which expects thereport to show slightly improved yields. The price of theDecember corn contract fell 0.75 cent to $2.5025 a bushelyesterday, while the November soybean contract rose 1.50cents to $5.8650 a bushel.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices rallied on concerns about dryweather in Brazil. Coffee for September delivery ended 2.10cents a pound higher at 89.90 cents. The actively tradedDecember contract finished at 93.55 cents, up 2.55 cents fromFriday. The lack of rain in August and continued dry weatherforecast for this week is bringing back memories of the 1985drought in Brazil that wiped out half of the crop and sentprices soaring to $2.75 a pound, said Celeste Georgakis,senior analyst at Cargill Investor Services. Mike Palmerino,senior meteorologist at Weather Services Corp. in Bedford,Mass., said a dry August isn't unusual and the heavy rainsnormally don't start until late September. But becausemaintenance has been poor this year, the crop is stressed andis developing faster than normal, requiring moisture earlier,he said. Ms. Georgakis added that Brazilian farmers haven'tbeen taking care of their crops because of low coffee pricesand lack of financing. Weather conditions appear to beimproving, Mr. Palmerino said, and if the trend continues,significant rain could fall by next week or the followingweek. In that case, the crop probably won't be in bad shape,he said. But if the dryness continues through this month, thecrop could suffer irreversible losses, he said, and thedamage could be devastating if it lasts into October. Ms.Georgakis added it is premature to declare the dry spell adrought but traders will be watching weather developmentsclosely. The next major area of resistance for Decembercoffee is between 95 cents and 97 cents, she said. If thedryness persists through next month, prices could breakthrough the psychologically important $1 level, she added.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices strengthened. Gold forSeptember delivery ended $2 an ounce higher at $351.10, whilethe actively traded December contract rose $1.80 to $355.20.September silver jumped 7.2 cents an ounce to $4.041.Actively traded December silver also rose 7.2 cents,finishing at $4.10. October platinum lagged the group, endingjust 10 cents an ounce higher at $351.70. William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, attributed therise in gold and silver to technical and seasonal factors.Jewelry and general industrial demand for the two metals hasbeen &quot;decent,&quot; he said. Moreover, the dollar's weak tone haslent support to precious metals prices. Mr. O'Neill doesn'tconsider the lift in prices a harbinger of a major bullrally, but rather as a respite from the recent weakness. StanSteinberg, executive vice president of Prudential-Bache MetalCo., said gold prices could rise sharply in the next coupleof months, as soon as someone in the Soviet Union emergeswith credible negotiating authority. Rather than selling goldat spot prices to raise hard currency, the Soviet Union wouldbe wiser to negotiate a deal with the World Bank,International Monetary Fund or Bank for InternationalSettlements to deposit the next five years of production inreserves in return for credit to buy much-needed foodstuffsand other products, Mr. Steinberg said. Such an arrangementwould take gold out of the available world supply, boostingprices and the amount of credit the Soviets can receiveagainst the gold it deposits, he said. If it instead sellsthe gold on the spot market and puts pressure on alreadydepressed gold prices, the Soviet Union will receive lesshard currency for its gold, he argued.</TEXT></DOC>
