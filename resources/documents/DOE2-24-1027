Countries with a large amout of heat supply includesenergy-consuming developed countries such as the U.S., German and Franceas well as the North European countries. The amount of heat supply inJapan is only 1/62 that in the U.S. The energy conservation and the useof alternative energy are effective for the North European countries,but not so effective for the developed countries. Although the typesof fuel vary according to the conditions of country, these countrieshave many common policies such as the reduction of dependence on oil,diversification of heat sources and utilization of waste heat. The heatsupply sources vary from energy conservation to cogeneration dependingupon the countries. In the countries mainly depending upon the hydraulicpower generation, it is difficult to introduce the cogeneration in relationto the electric power policy. The district heat supply in Europe andAmerica has developed so far competing with other systems by settingthe profitable price. The national subside policy is, however, effectivealso. The reduction of atmospheric pollution caused by burning coal forresidential space heating was an incentive to the district heat supplyin the European cities. The combustion efficiency was improved. In theenvironmental pollution in German, the emissions of SO{sub 2} and NOxwere decreased to 1.5 and 0.9%, respectively. (7 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
