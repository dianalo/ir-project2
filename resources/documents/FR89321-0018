The 1988 Actis contained at Title X, Subtitle A of the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct of 1988, which became effective on August 23, 1988. The 1988 Act directsthe Commission to address adverse foreign conditions affecting United Statescarriers in U.S.-foreign oceanborne trades, which conditions do not existfor carriers of those countries in the United States, either under U.S.law or as a result of acts of U.S. carriers or others providing maritimeor maritime-related services in the U.S. The 1988 Act prescribes an investigatory-typeproceeding, an information-gathering mechanism, and actions, or sanctions,which the Commission is directed to take to offset any adverse conditionsfound to exist. The sanctions authorized for the administration of the1988 Act are also made applicable by that statute to the administrationand enforcement of section 13(b)(5) (``section 13(b)(5)'') of the ShippingAct of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(b)(5), and section 19(1)(b)(``section 19'') of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (``1920 Act''), 46 U.S.C.app. 876(1)(b). The Commission regulations implementing those provisionsare codified at 46 CFR Parts 585 and 587.The Proposed Rule largely tracked the language of the 1988 Act and paralleledthe regulations implementing sections 19 and 13(b)(5). The more significantdepartures from the language of those regulations or the 1988 Act included:Language added to the definition of ``U.S. carrier'' to dichotomize moreclearly the definitions of U.S. carrier and foreign carrier contained inthe 1988 Act; a definition of the term ``voyage'' as used in the sanctionsprovision of the 1988 Act; a general, rather than a specific, requirementas to evidence and documentation supporting a petition for an investigationunder the 1988 Act, in order to reflect the statute's allowance of ``anyperson,'' not just an injured party, to file such a petition; provisionsto allow persons submitting comments in the course of a 1988 Act proceedingto advise the Commission of their preferences and positions on the confidentialityof their submissions; and reorganization of the sanctions provisions inthe sections 19 and 13(b)(5) regulations to better incorporate the additionalsanctions authorized by the 1988 Act.Comments on the Proposed Rule were received from ten parties: The UnitedShipowners of America (``USA''); \1\<NOTE/> Sea-Land Service, Inc. (``Sea-Land''); American PresidentLines, Ltd. (``APL''); \2\<NOTE/> Crowley Maritime Corporation (``Crowley'); \2\ Shippers forCompetitive Ocean Transportation (``SCOT''); the Governments representedin the Consultation Shipping Group (``CSG''); \3\<NOTE/> the Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners'Associations (``CENSA''); the North Atlantic Ports Association (``NAPA'');the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (``USTR''); and the U.S. Departmentof State (``DOS'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ USA's member companies purportedly ``own and operate over97% of all U.S.-flag liner capacity in international trade.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ APL and Crowley also join in the comments of USA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>I.e.,</T3> the Governments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, theFederal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary and Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Inasmuch as many of the comments addressed the same issues, they will bediscussed herein organized by subject matter_where applicable, by sectionof the rules_rather than organized by individual commenter. Also, to theextent commenters made similar arguments, those arguments may be attributedcollectively to a group of parties rather than to individuals.Section 588.2_DefinitionsThe four commenters representing U.S. carrier interests_USA, Sea-Land,APL and Crowley_all take issue with the Proposed Rule's definition of U.S.carrier.\4\<NOTE/> The U.S. carrier interests note that U.S. carriers may bedeemed, for the purpose of the 1988 Act, a ``foreign carrier'' under theProposed Rule. They indicate that U.S. carriers frequently support theirU.S.-flag operations with foreign-flag vessels, such as small feeder vessels,when, as APL explains, U.S.-flag vessels cannot be employed competitively.Crowley, for example, states that one of its subsidiaries, Trailer MarineTransport Corporation, employs seventeen vessels, most of which are U.S.-flag,but that of those used in foreign commerce, the majority are foreign-flag.The U.S. carrier interests are generally concerned that depending on thenumber of foreign-flag vessels it owns or charters, a bona fide U.S. carriercould jeopardize its standing as a carrier entitled to protections underthe 1988 Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Proposed Rule notes that the definitions of foreignand U.S. carriers are worded such that the two may overlap, in that a U.S.carrier ``operates vessels documented under the laws of the United States,''and a foreign carrier is one ``a majority of whose vessels are documentedunder'' foreign laws. Thus, a carrier operating some U.S.-flag vesselsbut even more foreign-flag vessels could be argued to fit both definitions.The Proposed Rule provides that a carrier meeting both definitions shallbe considered a foreign carrier.The U.S. carrier interests argue that Congress did not intend that recognizedU.S.-flag carriers lose the protections afforded them by the new legislationby adding to their foreign-flag fleet. Rather, they contend, the ``majority''language in the foreign carrier definition was adopted by Congress to preventa foreign carrier from evading sanctions under the 1988 Act by reflagginga few of its vessels under U.S. laws. The foreign carrier definition wasnot, they argue, intended to constitute a ``fleet composition test'' orto ``scrutinize or circumscribe the composition of U.S. carrier fleets.''Sea-Land comments, at 4-5.USA and the U.S. carriers all propose slightly different solutions to thequestion of how to define U.S. and foreign carriers. Each suggests twoalternative approaches, one being simply to adopt the statutory definitionsand to resolve any uncertainties as to application on a case-by-case basis.Each also suggests that an amendment of some sort may serve to clarifythe matter. Crowley, for instance, proposes basing the definition of U.S.carrier on ``all vessels operated by that carrier and by companies affiliatedwith that carrier by common control or ownership in both foreign and domesticoffshore commerce,'' thereby solving its own problem of its foreign-flag-basedsubsidiaries. Crowley comments, at 2. USA suggests that a more ``flexiblerule'' for defining U.S. carrier could be substituted, based on ``U.S.-flagcapacity'' and corporate citizenship, rather than a ``simplistic `vesselcount'.'' USA comments, at 3-4. Sea-Land's proposal focuses on amplifyingthe foreign carrier definition to disregard post-petition reflagging andto exclude carriers qualifying as U.S. citizens under section 2(a) of theShipping Act, 1916, 46 U.S.C. 802(a). APL suggests, more generally, adoptinga rule which ``builds in flexibility.'' APL comments, at 2.The legislative history of the 1988 Act suggests that there is some meritin the argument of the U.S. carrier interests that Congress intended itsrestrictive definition of foreign carriers to prevent their evading thelaw via reflagging, and not to attempt to circumscribe the range of U.S.carriers which may derive benefit from administration of the statute. Yetthe definitions of U.S. and foreign carriers in the 1988 Act are, notwithstandingarguments to the contrary, overlapping, an issue which appears to havebeen implicitly left for the FMC to resolve at its discretion.Each of the commenting U.S. carrier interests suggests that the statute'sversion of the definitions, however imperfect, be preserved in the Commission'srule, and that any questions be resolved on a case-by-case, ``flexible''basis. The problem with this approach is that, with a statutorily imposed120-day time limit on investigatory proceedings, an additional ``sub-proceeding''to determine whether a particular carrier should be considered U.S. orforeign for the purposes of the 1988 Act could render a timely resolutionof the major proceeding impossible. It will be difficult enough to completeeven one 1988 Act proceeding in the allotted time.Accordingly, the Commission is not persuaded by the suggestions that thestatutory definitions be adopted for the regulations, and that an <T3>ad hoc</T3> resolution of definitions controversies be attempted inthe course of each proceeding. Rather, the Commission considers it desirableto be able to define fairly clearly the carriers whose interests qualifyfor protection and the carriers who may be subject to sanctions, or atleast the standards or criteria to be applied in making those determinations.The alternative approaches suggested by the U.S. carrier interests appearto be worthy of further consideration, debate and analysis. However, eachone of the alternative approaches differs from the other and, given thenormal rulemaking procedure employed, none of the parties commenting inthis rulemaking has had the opportunity to reply to the specific concernsand suggestions of the U.S. carrier interests. Also, the definitions ofU.S. and foreign carrier are a fundamental and critical aspect of the rules,in that they will, in turn, determine the scope, efficacy, and the verynature of the proceedings conducted under the rules, and will affect theexpeditiousness of those proceedings as well. For these reasons, the Commissionhas determined to obtain further input from interested parties on the definitions.Rather than to delay the implementation of a Final Rule until the definitionsissue is resolved, the Commission intends to proceed with the the issuanceof a Final Rule and to address the definitions matter in a separate rulemakingproceeding. No other aspect of the Proposed Rule, as discussed below, haspresented the Commission with any justification for not proceeding expeditiouslyto a Final Rule. The Final Rule adopted herein will, for the time being,mirror the statutory definitions of U.S. and foreign carriers. When theseparate rulemaking is completed, Part 588 may subsequently be amendedshould clearer definitions be decided upon. The Commission anticipatesthat that proceeding will be instituted shortly by issuance of a noticeof inquiry.The only other variation from the statute's list of definitions is theCommission's addition of a definition for ``voyage''. That definition receivedonly favorable comment and has been preserved in the Final Rule.<T3>Section 588.4_Petitions</T3>The CSG Governments request the Commission to reconsider the absence ofa requirement in the rule that a petitioner allege harm to itself or producestatistical data demonstrating harm, as this absence could result in ``thepossibility of a large number of petitions being filed,'' including ``frivolouspetitions which could be vexatious.'' As noted in the Proposed Rule, however,the Commission believes that a requirement that petitioners show actualharm or produce statistical data of such would appear to circumvent theintent of the statute to allow <T3>any</T3> person, not just injured parties, to petition for action underthe 1988 Act. Shippers or forwarders, for example, or interested U.S. governmentofficials, may not be in a position to document the extent of harm causeda U.S. carrier by some foreign government's actions. Thus, the requirementurged by the CSG Governments could have a chilling effect on the filingof otherwise legitimate complaints, and has not been adopted in the FinalRule.An addition which has been made to the Final Rule in this section is anadditional paragraph at andSection;588.4(b), requiring a petitioner to identifyeach U.S. carrier alleged to be harmed and describing and documenting whyit is considered by petitioner to be a U.S. carrier. This requirement maybe further amended as necessary when the definitions matter is resolved.CENSA proposes an amendment to andSection;588.4(c), which states that petitionswhich fail to comply with the requirements of the previous paragraph willbe rejected. CENSA requests that the Final Rule expressly state that: ``Frivolousor harassing petitions will not be entertained.'' CENSA comments, at 2.The Commission does not find this language necessary. The requirementsof andSection;588.4(b) for an acceptable petition constitute the applicablestandard, and do not appear to want a separate criterion or test for frivolousnessor harassment. A petition which meets the andSection;588.4(b) standards wouldnot likely be considered frivolous or harassing. Similarly, the CSG Governments'suggestion that the Final Rule state that petitions unaccompanied by sufficientevidence will be immediately dismissed is superfluous to the language alreadyto that effect in andSection;588.4(c).Secton 588.6(c)_Information Demands and SubpoenasSeveral comments address the issue of confidentiality of submissions madein the course of a 1988 Act proceeding. Section 588.6(c) of the ProposedRule states that ``persons submitting information for consideration ina proceeding or investigation under this part may indicate in writing anyfactors they wish the Commission to consider relevant to a decision onconfidentiality,'' and that if the Commission determines not to affordconfidentiality when requested, it will advise the requester before anydisclosure occurs. Thus, SCOT's suggestion that persons have an opportunity``beyond mere notice'' to emphasize to the Commission the consequencesof disclosure (SCOT comments, at 2) seems to overlook the opportunity alreadyexplicitly provided in the rule.With respect to submissions made in proceedings under the 1988 Act, USAproposes that persons be afforded opportunity to withdraw or modify submissionsprior to public disclosure. This is the commission's intended practice,as relates to voluntary submissions, and is implicit in the rule's statementthat notice to submitters will be given prior to disclosure. Thus, no amendmentto the Final Rule in this regard appears necessary.No right of modification or withdrawal can be afforded, however, with respectto submissions made in response to andSection;588.6 information demands bythe Commission. Any confidentiality issues arising from mandatory submissionswill be handled on a case-by-case basis.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Mandatory submissions may be exempt from disclosure underthe Freedom of Information Act, as commercially sensitive financial dataor trade secrets, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), or as exempt investigatory records,5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)(A), (D). Submissions may also be made the subject ofa protective order under Rule 167 of the Commission's Rules of Practiceand Procedure, 46 CFR 502.167.CENSA requests that the Final Rule state that the Commission will not ``consider,as part of the record upon which it makes findings, any information whichis not made known to a party which is under investigation and as to whichits right to reply is denied.'' Disclosure of the facts and informationupon which the Commission relies to make findings and take actions is generallyrequired under constitutional concepts of due process and provisions ofthe Administrative Procedure Act.\6\<NOTE/> The Commission therefore considers it unnecessary to adoptspecific procedural safeguards for matters already governed by generalprinciples of administrative law and constitutional considerations. Moreover,the Commission disfavors adopting in advance a course of action withoutregard to the relevant facts and circumstances in a particular case. Suchdeterminations are best made on an <T3>ad hoc </T3>basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Also, the provisions of the Freedom of Information Actcould apply to require disclosure of documents.Section 588.7_Notificationto Secretary of State USTR notes that the Proposed Rule provides that the Commission will notifyDOS of the initiation of an investigation and may request action to seekresolution of the matter through diplomatic channels. USTR states thatbecause it ``also has responsibilities with respect to various unfair tradepractices affecting trade in goods and services'', it should also ``benotified at the same time as the State Department under this procedure.''While such a course of action may in certain instances be appropriate,the Commission will not amend andSection; 588.7 to require notification toUSTR of the initiation of an investigation in every instance. We believethat DOS, as the U.S. executive agency charged with diplomatic functions,should be notified routinely, but that other agencies, such as USTR, shouldformally be advised as circumstances warrant. Section 588.8_Action Against Foreign Carriers USA requests that a new action or ``sanction'' be added to the Final Rule,in which the Commission could condition the filing of foreign carriers'tariffs on certain reciprocal responses, such as ceasing to offer railand truck services in the United States when U.S. carriers face foreign-imposedrestrictions on those activities. The Commission finds such an amendmentto be superfluous, in that the list of sanctions at andSection; 588.8 ofthe rule is expressly not all-inclusive (andSection; 588.8(a) states: ``[S]uchaction may include, but is not limited to: * * *''), and a ``conditional''suspension of tariffs would be but a type of suspension already prescribedat andSection; 588.8(a)(3). The Commission deliberately avoided attemptingto list every possible remedy, lest an inadvertent omission mistakenlybe deemed an intended restriction, and also in order to retain the highestdegree of flexibility. CENSA and the CSG Governments cite with approval language in the <T2>Supplementary Information </T2>section of the Proposed Rule which states:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the Commission's intention to impose, to the extent administrativelyfeasible, sanctions under this section which are carefully crafted so asto meet effectively the adverse foreign shipping practices, while minimizingthe likelihood of causing undue or unnecessary disruption to the tradeor harm to innocent third parties.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">CENSA and the CSG Governments request that this statement be codifiedin the Final Rule itself. While the Commission is committed to carefuland responsible craftsmanship in taking actions pursuant to the 1988 Act,codifying this commitment as a procedural requirement might undermine theoverall efficacy of the rule by limiting the Commission's discretion andflexibility and injecting yet another issue to be addressed and litigatedin each, already time-constrained proceeding. This suggestion has not,therefore, been adopted. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG>Other comments on the Proposed Rule are of a more general nature, and donot require any amendments in the Final Rule. DOS notes that it ``findsacceptable'' the Proposed Rule, and that it trusts the ``existing closecooperative relationship'' between the Commission and DOS ``will not onlycontinue but will be strengthened under the new Act.'' As the instant rulesare similar to the Commission's section 19 rules with respect to notificationto DOS, the Commission anticipates that the cooperative relationship betweenit and DOS will continue, although the time constraints of the 1988 Actwill impose additional challenges to both agencies. USA urges that the Commission act promptly in taking action under the 1988Act, and that it not delay initiating individual proceedings pending thefinalization of this rulemaking. The 1988 Act does not require that a FinalRule serve as a condition precedent to any actions taken pursuant to theAct, and thus this rulemaking will not serve to delay the initiation ofany such proceedings.NAPA generally expresses concern with the impact of possible sanctionsunder the 1988 Act on U.S. ports, and does not directly address the ProposedRule itself. NAPA also questions whether the remedies provided by the 1988Act are not already available under the ``United Nations Code of Tradeand Development''\7\<NOTE/> or bilateral trade agreements. NAPA comments, at 2. NAPA'scomments on the 1988 Act itself, rather than the Proposed Rule, and itsunexplained references to UNCTAD and unspecified bilateral agreements,were not deemed germane to this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\Actually, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development'sCode of Conduct for Liner Conferences.Finally, Sea-Land opines that the sanctions made applicable to the 1920and 1984 Acts by the 1988 Act have been ``accurately incorporated'' intoParts 585 and 578 of the Commission's regulations, but fears that the ``authoritycitation'' listing the 1988 Act in Part 585 (implementing section 19 ofthe 1920 Act) may be ``misconstrued to alter the current `flag-blind' scope''of the 1920 Act. Sea-Land suggests this matter be addressed and clarifiedin the Final Rule. We fail to see how citing the 1988 Act in the 1920 Actrules could somehow be erroneously construed as amending the substanceof the 1920 Act itself. The only purpose for the authority citation wasto note, as the <T4>Federal Register</T4> requires, the source of the new sanctions addedto the 1920 Act rules.The Federal Maritime Commission has determined that this Final Rule isnot a ``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order 12291, 46 FR 12193,February 27, 1981, because it will not result in: (1) An annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effect on competition,employment investment, productivity, innovations, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.The Chairman of the Commission certifies, pursuant to section 605(b) ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>, that this Final Rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses,small organizational units, and small governmental jurisdictions.In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3518(c)(1)(B), and except for investigationsundertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities (<T3>e.g.</T3>, an entire industry), any information request or requirementin this part is not subject to the requirements of section 3507(f) of thePaperwork Reduction Act because such collection of information is pursuantto a civil, administrative action or investigation by an agency of theUnited States against specific individuals or entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>46 CFR Part 585Administrative practice and procedure, Maritime carriers.46 CFR Part 587Administrative practice and procedure, Maritime carriers.46 CFR Part 588Administrative practice and procedures, Confidential business information,Foreign trade, Maritime carriers, Trade practices, Transportation.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553; section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant MarineAct, 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b); sections 13(b)(5), 15 and 17 of theShipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. 1712(b)(5), 1714 and 1716; ReorganizationPlan No. 7 of 1961, 75 Stat. 840; and section 10002 of the Foreign ShippingPractices Act of 1988, the Federal Maritime Commission amends parts 585and 587 and adds a new Part 588 to Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulationsas follows:1.
