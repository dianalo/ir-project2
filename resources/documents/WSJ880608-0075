The statement, contained in a briefing paper distributed to journalists before the summit opened last night, is an explicit declaration of the PLO's willingness to recognize Israel and accept a two-state solution.    While the positions in the statement aren't new, the explicitness and the timing of its release are highly significant, signaling the PLO's determination to redress what it terms its &quot;Satanic image&quot; in the U.S. and Israel, and thus making it more difficult for U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, in particular, to continue excluding the PLO from the peace process.    &quot;We believe that all peoples -- the Jewish and the Palestinians included -- have the right to run their own affairs, expecting from their neighbors not only non-belligerence but the kind of political and economic cooperation without which no state can be truly secure,&quot; the PLO statement said. &quot;The Palestinians want that kind of lasting peace and security for themselves and the Israelis because no one can build his own future on the ruins of another's.&quot;    In the U.S., Israeli officials, who hadn't seen the full statement, said it appeared to contain new and interesting elements. But an official cautioned that it was important to see whether the ideas expressed in the statement emerge in resolutions adopted by the summit.    &quot;Does this mean that the PLO will renounce violence? Does this mean they recognize Israel? If the answer is yes . . . then it {the statement} is certainly something interesting and something we've not heard before,&quot; an Israeli official said. The official said he found particularly interesting the direct reference to Jewish people and to Israelis.    While the Israelis and Mr. Shultz might prefer to deal with Palestinians of their own choosing, the statement said, this is as unrealistic as the PLO wishing it could negotiate with members of Israel's &quot;peace now&quot; movement. If the U.S. and Israel doubt the PLO's credentials as the representative of the Palestinians, the statement said, they should arrange an internationally supervised referendum in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza to allow the population there to choose between the PLO and any other group of Palestinians the Israelis or the international community nominates.    &quot;The PLO is willing to abide by the outcome and step aside for any alternative leadership&quot; the people should choose, the statement said, because its reason for being &quot;is not the undoing of Israel, but the salvation of the Palestinian people and their rights . . . our ultimate aim being a free, dignified and secure life not only for our children but also for the children of the Israelis.&quot;    The PLO comes to the Algiers summit seeking three things: money; a restoration of its prestige, which was badly battered during the previous summit, in Amman, Jordan last November; and a rejection of the Shultz peace plan, which ignores the PLO and the notion of an independent Palestinian state.    However, moderate states may press for an augmentation of the Shultz plan rather than its outright rejection, calling for the inclusion of the PLO in the plan. The summit was initially resisted by moderate Arab states. Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Persian Gulf countries feared the gathering would merely provide an opportunity for the PLO to extract greater financial commitments. And Jordan, which has had bitter conflicts with the PLO, will once again be expected to proclaim enthusiasm for a PLO-dominated state on its border.    Algeria, which promoted the summit, once again has demonstrated its skill in finessing tricky situations by pulling the summit together with moderates such as Jordan's King Hussein and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd conspicuously in attendence.    n a formal opening speech, King Hussein praised the Palestinian uprising but didn't once mention the PLO. </TEXT></DOC>
