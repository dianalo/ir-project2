Law&quot; and&quot;Perry Mason&quot; to millions and makes &quot;the right to remainsilent&quot; a prime-time slogan comes a report suggestingwidespread ignorance of even the simplest legal concepts.   A survey by the State Bar of California indicates nearlyhalf the state's adults mistakenly believe it's up to theaccused to prove innocence of a crime. Perhaps even morealarmingly, nearly half incorrectly think citizens may usedeadly force in response to a nonlethal threat.</LP><TEXT>   Some 53% surveyed couldn't correctly identify the Bill ofRights from a list that includes &quot;a message of rebellion fromthe founding fathers to the British king.&quot; (The correctanswer: &quot;the first 10 amendments to the originalConstitution.&quot;)   The 440-person survey, done in recognition of national LawDay yesterday, asked questions designed to test knowledge ofconstitutional rights, basic contract principles,landlord-tenant law and other legal subjects. Although onlyCalifornia residents were polled, bar association officialssaid the results would probably be similar nationwide.   &quot;We would have to give the people of California a `C-' fortheir legal knowledge,&quot; said Charles Vogel, state barpresident, in announcing the findings. &quot;Clearly, we have along way to go in educating our citizens about theirfundamental rights and responsibilities.&quot;   The survey, which broke down respondents' answers by raceand education level, showed Hispanics, blacks and Asiansscoring more poorly than whites. In particular, thepercentage of those minorities not knowing that the burden ofproof rests with prosecutors was sharply lower -- 31% in thecase of Hispanics, compared with 62% for whites.   One jurist who prides himself on helping to popularizebasic legal principles, &quot;People's Court&quot; Judge Joseph A.Wapner, called the the survey results &quot;deplorable&quot; but saidhe wasn't surprised. &quot;We are a society of laws, but if wedon't know these laws and what they're all about it leads toa terrible loss of material things, a loss of time, a loss ofphysical energy, and much psychological hurt,&quot; the former LosAngeles County Superior Court jurist said.   Judge Wapner blamed the lack of knowledge partly oneducators and partly on the popular media. &quot;People can be somisled by what they see in the movies or on television. Someof the shows are the worst, like the movie a few years agothat showed a judge talking to one side's lawyer without theother being present,&quot; he said.   Judge William Schwarzer, director of the Federal JudicialCenter, said the survey results indicate the education systemisn't working properly. &quot;It's very important for people toknow what's going on in society. How can they understand newsabout crime, about current affairs, unless they know thebasic principles? There has to be an atmosphere that valueslearning. You shouldn't have to go to law school to learncivics,&quot; Judge Schwarzer said.   Some, however, questioned whether the survey points toserious deficiencies in Americans' legal understanding.Sociologist Amitai Etzioni said broad-based queries aboutgeneral knowledge fail to acknowledge that most people becomeinformed when they need to -- such as when arrested, or justbefore an election.   Los Angeles attorney Charles B. Rosenberg, legal adviserto the &quot;L.A. Law&quot; TV series, said the findings neithersurprised nor troubled him. &quot;People don't really need to knowsome of these rules, any more than they need to know how carswork, because there's someone else whose specialized job itis to know that,&quot; he said.   But other observers commented that the survey underscoresthe importance of teaching legal concepts, many of which runagainst instinct. Author Scott Turow, who also is a criminaldefense attorney, noted that &quot;it often takes jurors a longtime to shed the attitude that the defendant is not supposedto explain himself. In fact, that particular concept may becounterintuitive,&quot; because accused persons often feel a needto exculpate themselves.   Mr. Turow said that, while he'd like the public morelegally literate, &quot;it's a little duplicitous for lawyers toclaim to have this educated specialty, then at the same timewant people to be fully informed.&quot;   California's study, while on a broader range of legalissues, appeared to be in line with findings from a nationalsurvey on constitutional matters conducted in 1987 by HearstCorp. The majority of respondents to that study, done for thebicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, confused that documentwith the Declaration of Independence.</TEXT></DOC>
