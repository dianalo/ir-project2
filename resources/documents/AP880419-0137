The 52-year-old al-Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, wasassassinated Saturday in a commando raid at his home outside theTunisian capital.   Israeli sources have acknowledged that Israel was responsiblefor al-Wazir's death but the government officials have notconfirmed this.   The plane carrying Al-Wazir's body arrived in the Syrian capitalat 2:45 p.m. after a flight from Tunisia.   Accompanying the body were al-Wazir's wife, Intisar, his fivechildren, and senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials,including political department chief Farouk Kaddoumi, ExecutiveCommittee member Mahmoud Abbas, and the guerrilla movement'ssecurity chief, Hayel Abdel-Hamid.   Arafat, the PLO chief, saw the body off at Tunis airport butstayed behind, apparently because of his feud with President HafezAssad of Syria.   Arafat and al-Wazir were expelled from Damascus in June 1983after a Syrian-backed mutiny in PLO ranks.   The PLO chief's media adviser, Bassam Abu Sharif, confirmed in atelephone interview with The Associated Press that Arafat would notattend al-Wazir's funeral Wednesday.   Al-Wazir was born in Ramle, which is now in Israel, and hadasked to be buried close to Palestine. His mother and father livein Damascus.   Abu Sharif said another top PLO leader, Salah Khalaf, betterknown as Abu Iyad, also would not attend the funeral. He, too, hasnot visited Damascus since the PLO-Syrian feud.   Al-Wazir, Khalaf and Arafat launched Fatah, the PLO's mainguerrilla group, in 1965. Fatah accounts for more than 80 percentof the PLO's military strength.   The PLO and the Tunisian government have blamed Israel for themurder of al-Wazir, who reportedly masterminded Palestinian riotingagainst Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, haveprivately acknowledged that the Mossad intelligence service and theIsraeli navy cooperated in the assassination.   The Tunisian government filed a complaint today with the U.N.Security Council. Tunisian investigators said Israel was behind theattack, in which al-Wazir and two aides were killed.   Tunisia's ambassador to the United Nations today requested anurgent meeting of the Security Council to condemn the assassination.   President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia condemned the``flagrant, premeditated aggression against Tunisian sovereignty.''   The U.S. government on Monday sharply criticized al-Wazir'skilling. ``Violence is not the solution to the problems of theMiddle East,'' said State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.   The Tunisian investigators' report said an Israeli militaryBoeing 707 was 34 miles outside Tunisian air space at time of theattack.   The plane, ``of the type used in the electronic war,'' jammedcommunications in Sidi Bou Said, the northern suburb where Wazirlived outside Tunis, the report said.   ``The terrorist group which assassinated the Palestinian leaderhad sophisticated technological support which put this operationbeyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind ofterrorism that only states are in a position to practice,'' thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
