Today, it has 484 loan offices, 270,000 credit card accounts,190,000 life insurance agents and 35,000 representatives registeredto sell mutual funds.   If any one company exemplifies what happened to business in the1980s, it may be Primerica Corp., the former American Can Co.,which in the decade transformed itself from manufacturing tofinancial services.   While some differ on the wisdom of the trend, economists agreethe 1980s were a time when the economy's shift from manufacturingto services accelerated.   From 1979 to 1987, the number of jobs in manufacturing droppedfrom 21 million to 19 million, while jobs in the service sectorgrew from 63 million to 77 million, according to statistics fromthe U.S. Census Bureau.   Manufacturing's share of the gross national product fell from22.5 percent in 1979 to 20.8 percent in 1985, according to a 1989study by Lawrence R. Mishel, research director at the EconomicPolicy Institute in Washington.   American Can was formed at the turn of the century from 123small canning firms and can manufacturers. Business prosperedthrough the 1950s, as a growing number of manufacturers soughtpackaging for everything from tomato paste to tennis balls.   When growth began to slow in the 1950s, American Can diversifiedby moving into paper products, printing and various recyclingbusinesses. In the 1970s, it moved into retailing, buying outfitslike Musicland record stores and the Fingerhut mail-order house.   The big move into financial services came in the 1980s. It beganin 1982 when American Can bought Associated Madison Cos. Inc., alife insurance holding company, for $127 million. Associated'schairman, financial whiz Gerald Tsai Jr., came on board to engineerthe transformation into financial services, an industry he saw asfragmented and leaning toward deregulation.   American Can spent the next several years buying more than $1billion worth of insurance and other financial businesses andselling off paper and packaging operations and all its retailinterests except for Fingerhut.   As the American economy boomed in the mid-1980s, so did thetransformed American Can. In 1987, for the third straight year, thecompany's insurance lines sold more life insurance than any otherU.S. group. Revenues from financial services grew. Net incomealmost doubled from 1983 to 1986.   By then, financial services accounted for more than 70 percentof the company's profits.   American Can changed its name to Primerica on April 28, 1987.One month later, it added frosting to the cake, spending $750million to buy Smith Barney, the esteemed old Wall Street firm.   The move seemed smart until five months later, when the stockmarket crashed. As Wall Street stumbled, so did Primerica, whosenet income dropped. Smith Barney had pretax losses of $93 millionin 1987 and $53 million in 1988.   ``I remember thinking this was not going to be very good for theold Primerica because they just bought Smith Barney,'' said SanfordJ. Weill, now Primerica's chairman. ``It turned out to happen at awrong time. Smith Barney didn't do well for a year and a half.''   But, like the market, Primerica was far from sunk. In December1988, it was bought by Commercial Credit Group Inc. Weill, aschairman of Commercial Credit, took over from Tsai and is presidingin new Manhattan headquarters as the company tries to become aforce in financial services.   Just this year, Primerica announced that its Commercial Creditwas buying the branch offices and loan portfolio of BarclaysAmerican-Financial for $1.35 billion. The purchase is expected tostrengthen Commercial Credit's position as one of the country'smajor consumer and home-equity lenders.   Not all is perfect in Primerica's future. One of the samequestion marks that faces the American economy entering the 1990salso faces the company: the financial markets' continuingvolatility, seen in the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrialaverage on Oct. 13.   ``That kind of volatility, when it comes so fast with no notice,people say, `Is this really a safe place to put our money?''' Weillsaid. ``I think we have a real job to do to get the individual tobelieve in investing in equities again in this country.''   But Weill remains optimistic that financial services is a goodplace to be in the 1990s. If troubles affect Smith Barney,Primerica can still count on earnings from its commercial creditand life insurance businesses, he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
