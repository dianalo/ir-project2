In the final hours before Congress passed a $4.1 billion tax bill and adjourned, the negotiators agreed to raise taxes on certain corporate takeovers, making some popular takeover ploys more costly. The provisions would hit acquirers who sell subsidiaries after a takeover -- a favorite technique to reduce debt -- as well as takeovers that use tax benefits of Employee Stock Ownership Plans.    When the House and Senate approved the tax bill early Saturday, lawmakers didn't mention the last-minute provisions, and congressional staffers described them as technical. While the estimated revenue of almost $100 million over three years is relatively small, the provisions might be perceived as an anti-takeover push by Congress. They could have the effect of slowing certain takeover activity, congressional sources acknowledged over the weekend.    One provision would restrict the use of a tax-deferral technique now used by acquirers who sell subsidiaries and receive a note as part of the sale. Currently, corporate raiders can buy a big company and sell off its pieces using the installment-sales method of accounting, deferring their tax payments on gains from the sales until they receive payments on the note.    Lawmakers late Friday night decided to cut down on the tax-deferral technique, which they discussed had been most recently exercised by Campeau Corp. after its takeovers of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.    Staffers told the tax conferees that Campeau had been able to use the installment method to defer until the 1990s taxes on gains from the recent sales of certain subsidiaries. They suggested that corporate raiders could even use the notes as collateral for loans, effectively converting the tax-deferral method into cash.    The provision they approved would impose an interest charge on any deferral of tax from an installment sale of subsidiaries. It also would require that all tax be paid if the seller used the note and pledged it as security for a loan to get cash.    The second provision inserted at the last minute would hit takeovers in which Employee Stock Ownership Plans help reduce taxes.    Current law restricts a corporation that buys a company with net operating losses from using all of those losses to offset the acquirer's income. An exception exists if the target company has an ESOP, in which case all losses can be deducted for tax purposes. Lawmakers worried that this allowed an acquirer to have a few employees of the target corporation, such as its management, set up an ESOP and then go along with the takeover. The provision in the tax bill would prevent an acquirer from gaining such tax benefits unless the target company's ESOP included more than 50% of its employees.    Congressional tax negotiators agreed to these two provisions late Friday when a last-minute crisis threatened to kill the entire tax bill. A few senators threatened to block the bill on the Senate floor because of various provisions affecting their states.    To prevent such challenges, conferees agreed on several modifications that would have resulted in a revenue shortfall. In a rush to complete the bill, conferees agreed to these two takeover-related provisions in order to make up the shortage. </TEXT></DOC>
