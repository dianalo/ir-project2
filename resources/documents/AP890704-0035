(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple of red-faced Texas truck drivershad some tall explaining to do when they nearly allowed Chandler's``Uncle Sam Jam'' to turn into one big Independence Day dud.   Truckers Al Freeman and Raymond Perez of Fort Worth were headingto Chandler with nearly a ton of fireworks when they picked up ahitchhiker Freeman described as ``just a good-lookin' ol' girl.''   Police say the three and their cargo made it all the way toArizona before things went wrong.   When the truckers stopped to buy beer, the hitchhiker stole theirtruck, fireworks and all, police say.   ``They were in for a little night of partying, but she had otherplans,'' said police Lt. John Summers. ``The two guys were going toget some beer and she just boogied with the truck.''   But the ``Uncle Sam Jam'' fireworks display will go on. Policefound the truck, with its cargo intact, early Monday, Summers said.   Freeman and Perez, who were driving for Atlas Enterprises, aCalifornia fireworks company, said they were only 25 miles out ofFort Worth when the picked up the hitchhiker at a truck stop.   They said the woman was headed for California and they agreed totake her as far as Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix.   When they pulled into Chandler on Sunday night, Freeman said, thetruckers bought dinner and invited the woman to spend the night withthem. The party ended while Freeman and Perez were buying beer.   ``I walked out of the liquor store, and I said. `There goes ourtruck,''' Freeman said.   The woman told the truckers her name was Kim Mayberry and thatshe was trying to get to Oceanside, Calif., to visit her sister.   Police were still looking for her late Monday, Summers said.   Terry McIntyre, an Atlas spokesman, said police woke him up earlyMonday to tell him the truck had been stolen.   ``When I heard it was stolen I went berserk,'' McIntyre said.``It's maybe like losing your wife, maybe even worse. There's no waywe could have gotten the product in time. There wouldn't have been ashow.''   Perez said he felt stupid when he found out that he and Freemanhad been duped.   Freeman said he's been driving for 12 years and the woman was farfrom the first hitchhiker he has picked up. And she probably won'tbe the last.   ``I ain't never gonna change,'' he said. ``But I expect I'll getthe lecture.''</TEXT></DOC>
