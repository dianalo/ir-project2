Some experts say the party could lose itsoutright majority in Parliament under a two-pronged assault from theleft and right. Here are profiles of its two resurgent rivals, thefar-right Conservative Party and the anti-apartheid Democratic Party.</TEXT><BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOKSBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The far-right Conservative Party'ssolution to South Africa's political and racial turmoil is simple:strengthen apartheid.   The blunt call for strict segregation at a time of politicaluncertainty earned the Conservatives 26 percent of the country'swhite vote in 1987, a figure almost certain to rise in the electionsfor a new Parliament on Sept. 6.   ``We are not prepared to share power with blacks, coloreds orIndians,'' the party's leader, Andries Treurnicht, wrote recently.``That will undoubtedly lead to black majority government, aracially integrated South Africa, the further impoverishment ofwhites.''   The Conservatives hold 23 of the 166 elected seats in thedominant white chamber of Parliament and could gain at least 20.They were given a boost by the resignation Aug. 14 of President P.W.Botha and his bitter criticism of his own National Party, which hasheld power since 1948.   The Conservatives control dozens of local governments where theyhave been reimposing hard-line apartheid measures despitecontroversy and stiff resistance.   The National Party has joined the chorus of critics attacking thereturn of ``petty apartheid'' measures, but the Conservatives saythey are merely enforcing laws placed on the books by theNationalists.   In Boksburg, an industrial town 12 miles southeast ofJohannesburg, the Conservative-controlled city council re-segregatedthe town park, athletic fields, municipal halls and other facilitieslast year.   Blacks organized a consumer boycott in December that initiallylooked as if it would cripple the town economically. Politicalobservers, both black and white, predicted Boksburg would produce anembarrassing failure for the Conservatives.   But the city council stood firm, and the boycott has weakenedover time. On a recent weekday afternoon, black shoppers faroutnumbered whites at the largest supermarket on the town's mainstreet.   The Conservatives now point proudly to Boksburg as proof of itsability to withstand pressure.   ``We are fighting for the white man's future and we don't mind alittle pressure,'' said Sias Nothnagel, the Conservative candidatefor Parliament in Boksburg.   In its pre-election newsletter, the Conservatives compareBoksburg with Hillbrow, a ``whites-only'' section of Johannesburg,into which thousands of blacks have moved illegally in recent years.   The National Party government has said it might legally openHillbrow and a few other select neighborhoods to all races.   Boksburg's crime rate has been falling, while Hillbrow has one ofthe highest in the country, the Conservatives note. They sayproperty values are rising and new businesses are opening inBoksburg, while housing prices are falling and shops are closing inHillbrow.   ``Your Choice: Hillbrow (National Party) or Boksburg(Conservative Party),'' a Conservative ad says.   The message has strong appeal for many rural and blue-collarwhites who see the National Party's limited race reforms ascapitulation to the black majority.   ``Why are so many people voting for the Conservative Party?''asked Acting President F.W. de Klerk, the leader of the NationalParty. ``It's not because they think the policy can work. It'sbecause they feel endangered.''   Blacks are coming to the cities in increasing numbers and in manycases are getting jobs previously held by whites. Most publicfacilities have been integrated, especially in major cities.   ``There is no way one can protect the white people in oneundivided state juxtaposed with an ever-increasing and overwhelmingnumber of blacks,'' said Treurnicht, who holds a doctorate intheology and was a National Party Cabinet minister before resigningin 1982 to organize the Conservatives.   The Conservatives want to partition South Africa into one whiteand several black ``nations'' as envisioned by Prime MinisterHendrik Verwoerd, a Nationalist, in the early 1960s.   The National Party government has created 10 black homelands, butonly four have accepted nominal ``independence'' and none isrecognized abroad. The government has given no indication it plansto dismantle the homelands but has acknowledged that blacks livingoutside these tribal territories should have some degree ofpolitical rights.   Whites account for only 5 million of South Africa's 37 millionpeople, but the Conservatives seek to claim all the major cities andthe best farmland for whites.   ``We believe it is not too late to implement partition,'' saidTreurnicht. ``We will not be talked or intimidated out of that whichis legally ours, a part of South Africa where we will governourselves.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
