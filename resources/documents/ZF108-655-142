Jr.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Appearing in your April 30 coverage of the Type-X show was an articlediscussing the &quot;remote diagnostic function&quot; demonstrated by a competitor ofours.andP;  This article is misleading in two areas: the article implies that thediagnostic assistance is broader in scope than is possible with the techniqueused, and the article incorrectly states that this introduction is a &quot;first&quot;in its field.andM;The technique described uses Farallon's Timbuktu to enable the company'stechnician to &quot;take control of the user's workstation, allowing thetechnician to `see' what is going on and try various solutions  ...... Thistechnique permits a remote operator to determine only what he or she coulddetermine if actually seated at the keyboard of the workstation involved.andO;This is, indeed, a useful functionality and several companies-oursincluded-have used this technique for some time now for the purposes stated.andO;This limited use of diagnostics is, however, hardly a &quot;first&quot; !andP;  We also takeexception to the article's implication that this form of diagnostics is inany way similar to the remote diagnostics used by IBM and others to diagnosemainframe problems, The class of diagnostics used in mainframe environmentsis one which Tegra (Varityper's parent company) introduced into theimagesetter system market in 1986.andP;  This class of diagnostics includespowerful systems tools under which faults can be isolated to the board levelanywhere within the imagesetting system and under which a remote techniciancan verify software levels, can examine the nature of the fonts present, andcan even effect corrective actions as appropriate.andP;  This form of diagnosticsis supported on the Varityper Series 4000 and Series 5000 imagesettingsystems and is installed as a standard feature on every Series 5000 systemever shipped.andM;It is important to us that your readership understand the facts in thismatter, for we feel that the better informed a practitioner is, the morelikely he or she is to purchase our products.andP;  It is for this reason that wevalue your publication and its well deserved reputation for customarilyreporting objectively and in depth.andM;Kevin J.
