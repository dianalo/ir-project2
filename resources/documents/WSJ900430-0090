The Bush administration, despite heavy pressure, droppedJapan from the list of unfair traders. But the administrationagain cited India for unfair trade practices in investmentand insurance. India was designated last year along withJapan and Brazil under terms of the &quot;Super 301&quot; provision ofthe 1988 trade act.</LP><TEXT>   While the U.S. has in recent months reached agreementswith Brazil and Japan, &quot;we have made no progress whatsoeverwith India. I really couldn't refrain from naming them,&quot; U.S.Trade Representative Carla Hills said. The U.S. is likely totake trade retaliatory measures against India July 15.   India criticized the U.S. action, and few observers therethink it will lead to policy changes soon. The Super 301citation is &quot;against all the tenets of multilateralism,&quot; andIndia won't negotiate trade policies under U.S. threats,Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh said.   But, by substituting the current multilateral talks underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for new Super 301designations, the U.S. is sidestepping potentially disruptivequarrels with other trading partners and putting its bestefforts behind the GATT talks, which are to be completed thisyear.   Those talks &quot;are the most promising route for creating newopportunities for American industry and agriculture andstrengthening the global trading system,&quot; President Bushsaid.   The GATT round coincides with the second, and last, yearfor Super 301, which requires the White House traderepresentative to name the nation's top trade priorities anddesignate countries that maintain egregious barriers toforeign trade. The administration is then required tonegotiate those barriers away within 12 months to 18 months.Failure to do so carries the threat of trade retaliation.   The deadline for designating unfair trade practices underSuper 301 was April 30. There had been substantial lobbyingfrom the Congress and the Commerce Department for Japan to benamed again, and there now is some anger at the failure to doso. Last year Japan accounted for about half the nation's$100 billion trade deficit.   Sen. John C. Danforth (R., Mo.) termed the decision&quot;deeply disappointing and a serious tactical mistake,&quot; whileHouse Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D., Mo.) said theU.S. had given Japan &quot;a free trade furlough.&quot;   The administration vehemently rejects that view. &quot;What wasa good tool 18 months ago isn't necessarily a good tool now,&quot;Mrs. Hills said, discussing Super 301. Japan, she argued, has&quot;moved farther and faster than any of our other tradingpartners in the past 12 months.&quot; In the past year, the U.S.and Japan have reached trade agreements coveringsupercomputers, satellites, telecommunications and woodproducts.   But Mrs. Hills, who pays careful attention to Congress,warned, &quot;I have made it very clear that if I don't get theresults I want, I will use the tools I have.&quot;   Some important trade hawks in Congress have also backedaway from outright condemnations of the administration'sapproach: Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said he's glad somedesignations were made, and contented himself with sayinghe's &quot;a bit of a skeptic as to whether recent agreements{with Japan} will make much difference.&quot;   &quot;I hope that Congress will realize that we do have allthese checkpoints, and that those looking at it from anon-partisan point of view should be satisfied,&quot; CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher said. &quot;The president very wiselyasked Carla {Hills} for an expanded semiannual report whichwill be due in the fall,&quot; and will give the administration achance to review the progress on enacting bilateral tradeagreements with Japan, the commerce chief added.   In the meantime, the administration is throwing its weightbehind the GATT talks. They represent &quot;a unique opportunityto commit nearly 100 countries,&quot; including the EuropeanCommunity and Japan, &quot;to open their markets fully, and totrade freely and fairly,&quot; said Mrs. Hills.   In those talks, the U.S. is particularly pursuing fivegoals: increased market access, with the aim of a tariff-freeworld; fundamental reform of agricultural trade; agreed rulesin the new areas of trade in services, investment andintellectual property; curbs on trade-distorting subsidies;and integration of the developing world into the tradingsystem. The GATT talks are known as the Uruguay Round becausethey were launched at a multilateral meeting in thatcountry's seaside resort of Punta del Este.   Partly because of the GATT round, this year's approach toSuper 301 was much more sober than that in 1989. At thattime, the administration was prepared to rattle the saberswith Congress, brand other countries as unfair traders andeven joke about it.   In Mrs. Hills's conference room here, a message about lastyear's Super 301 -- signed by President Bush and dated June29, 1989 -- adorns the wall. It shows Mr. Bush standing withhis hands over his eyes. He has inscribed it: &quot;The 301 award1989 given to Carla Hills. Shown here is the president justhaving heard from Sarney, Gandhi and Uno&quot; (the respectivepolitical leaders of Brazil, India and Japan at that date).   The administration also again this year held back fromspecifically designating countries under so-called Special301, a clause of the 1988 trade act that covers unfairpractices in intellectual property such as patents, softwareand copyrights.   As it did last year, the administration published twowatch lists to put transgressors on notice: a &quot;priority watchlist&quot; that includes Brazil, China, India and Thailand, and anordinary watch list that includes Argentina, Canada, Chile,Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, SouthKorea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia,Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.   ---   Anthony Spaeth in New Delhi contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
