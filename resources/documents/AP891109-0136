The exhibit, which opens Nov. 28, is aimed at selling offreusable parts of intermediate-range nuclear missile installationsthat were dismantled under a 1987 superpower treaty.   It is also meant to pave the way for broader sales of equipmentthat will no longer be needed as the Soviet Union cuts its militaryforces and future treaties rule out other types of weapons, saidElvin Kalinin, one of the fair's organizers.   The money the fair is expected to bring in this year will go inpart to help support servicemen who are discharged as a result ofthe cutbacks, Kalinin said.   The Soviet Union is in the process of reducing troops and tanksin Europe and Asia, and it has shifted from aggressive arms-racerhetoric to espousing a doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency.''   It has already destroyed 297 of its 654 SS-20s under the 1987treaty and the rest are due to be scrapped over the next two years.The United States, keeping pace, has eliminated 486 of its 846rockets covered by the treaty.   The proceeds from the military sale will also be used to raisethe living standards of soldiers remaining in the army and tocharity, said Kalinin, who heads Intellect, a foundation aimed atencouraging creativity among youth that is one of the charities tobenefit from the sale.   Foreigners will be allowed to buy most of the military goods onsale at Moscow's Sokolniki Park, and some of the offerings will beput up for auction.   The several hundred items at the fair will include theheavy-terrain vehicles used as missile carriers, radio andelectrical elements, generators, measuring devices, frames, pipes,condensers and other miscellanea.   Kalinin said the missile carriers could be used to transportconstruction cranes or vats of fertilizer on farms and the mobileliving units that housed the missile installation crews could beused by geologists in the field.   The pipes and electrical supplies are assured plenty of Sovietbuyers because of the widespread shortage of constructionmaterials, Kalinin noted.   Much of the equipment which was part of the nuclear missileinstallations has never been used, he added.   ``If it had been, we wouldn't be sitting here,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
