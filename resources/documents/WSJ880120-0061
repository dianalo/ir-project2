We've just had a look at the first Red red herring -- going beyond the preliminary stage -- for the Soviet Union's maiden bond offering to Westerners. As we expected, it falls a few miles short of full disclosure.    The Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the U.S.S.R. is raising 100 million Swiss francs with bonds to be listed on the Swiss exchanges. Hans Peter Saettele of Westdeutsche Landesbank, which is leading the offering through a Swiss affiliate, assembled reporters in Dusseldorf to tell them that the Soviets provided information &quot;which until now in the West could only be speculated about.&quot;    What we discovered, however, was a Communist state going through the forms of capitalism without the substance. For example, we learn that this bank was incorporated in 1924 as a &quot;joint-stock company.&quot; It has 20,000 shares outstanding, of which the State Bank of the U.S.S.R. owns 12,000, the Finance Ministry 1,000, and the Foreign Trade Ministry 1,000. Some 18 other institutions -- such as the All-Union Agency of Authors' Rights Reservation and the State Committee for International Tourism -- own the rest. No individual owners appear. The bank, on Jan. 1, 1987, had &quot;fully paid-up&quot; capital of 1 billion rubles and &quot;a reserve capital account&quot; of 910 million rubles.    Proceeds of the Swiss bond issue will be used &quot;for general financing purposes.&quot; The borrowing bank is described as &quot;engaged in a broad range of activities at home and abroad.&quot; There's no mention of its relations, if any, with, say, the Palestine Liberation Organization or Nicaragua. The bank is said, among other things, to trade in gold, silver, platinum and other precious metals and stones. Its dividend soared to 11,772.69 rubles a share in 1986 from 6,514.97 a share in 1982 -- though it's unclear whether the All-Union Agency of Authors' Rights Reservation and the other owners are happy.    The Communist Party Central Committee, the prospectus says, passed in July 1987 a resolution on the development of the banking system, providing for &quot;major measures&quot; in the field of credit and finance. This bank got a new name. It used to be called the Bank for Foreign Trade of the U.S.S.R. A balance sheet is provided, claiming that total assets climbed to 64.83 billion rubles in 1987 from 60.92 billion in 1986 and that net profit, after &quot;taxes,&quot; rose to 506 million rubles in 1987 from 492.2 million in 1986. What purports to be a favorable report of the auditing commission for the bank is cited.    The closest the document comes to disclosing that the Soviet Union is a Communist state is in the chapter that says, &quot;One of the characteristic features of the economy of the USSR is that it has a planned character.&quot; A table is provided showing that the country's &quot;gross social product&quot; in current prices rose to 1.426 trillion rubles in 1986 from 1.384 trillion in 1985 and 1.079 trillion in 1980.    &quot;The development of prices in the USSR,&quot; the document asserts, &quot;is characterized by relative stability, in particular the consumer price index as the most dynamic element in the price formation has grown by only 7 basis points since 1980.&quot; The chapter does not mention slave labor, price controls, exchange controls, prohibitions on private property, or restrictions on emigration. A brief paragraph on the state budget actually claims that expenditures &quot;are mainly allocated for the development of the economy, as well as for social and cultural needs&quot; and fails to make any mention of a military machine that accounts for a very sizable chunk of those &quot;development expenditures.&quot;    The Kremlin's vaunted gold holdings are nowhere detailed nor is foreign exchange accounted for. No discussion is offered on the convertibility of the ruble or how the Soviets might repay the Swiss francs they will owe the takers of their bonds. No allusion is made to decades-old Western claims for assets seized or destroyed during the Revolution. The clincher is a final section that in its entirety says: &quot;Debt record: The USSR has paid when due the full currency face amount of principal (including required amortization) and interest on every external obligation issued by it, or in respect of which it has been required to implement its guarantee.&quot;    All of which suggests that &quot;glasnost,&quot; as applied to high finance, still has a long way to go. One of the Soviet bankers at the Dusseldorf presentation was Victor Geraschenko, who asserted: &quot;We are a normal commercial bank.&quot; He said the amount of money now being borrowed &quot;doesn't have a lot of meaning in terms of the sums we deal with.&quot; But he said that &quot;as a first it is of importance.&quot; The Soviets want the Swiss bond offering to be &quot;a trust-building measure for the future.&quot; They say the bond offering is going well and that they intend to come to the market again soon. If so, it is a sign of the political times -- and not the result of any information disclosed in the Soviet Union's first prospectus that would be useful to investors. </TEXT></DOC>
