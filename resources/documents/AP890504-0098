(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of two men who said they tookhostages in The Robesonian newspaper office to draw attention toofficial corruption pleaded guilty today to fourteen counts ofsecond-degree kidnapping.   Timothy Jacobs, 20, agreed to a plea bargain that called for himto serve six years in prison followed by a six-year suspendedsentence with supervised probation.   ``He wants to get on with his life and do something withhimself,'' said his mother, Eleanor Jacobs, after the courtappearance. ``It was his decision (to plea bargain). I didn't talkhim into anything.''   Jacobs was whisked away by deputies after posting bond so thathe could sign out of the Cumberland County Jail. Asked what hewould do during the 30-day leave, he said, ``Enjoy myself. ... Signa movie contract.''   His lawyer had asked for the time so that Jacobs could getmarried and attend to other personal affairs. District AttorneyRichard Townsend criticized the arrangement, saying, ``I object tohim having a honeymoon.''   Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher held up to 20 people hostage in thenewspaper's newsroom for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988. They said theytook over the newspaper to draw attention to allegations ofofficial corruption and drug trafficking in Robeson County.   A state task force appointed by Gov. Jim Martin found noevidence to support their allegations.   Hatcher and Jacobs were acquitted last year by a federal jury inRaleigh on hostage-taking charges. The state charges then werefiled by Robeson County authorities.   Jacobs had sought refuge from the state charges by fleeing to anIndian reservation in upstate New York. He was returned to NorthCarolina in March after dropping an appeal of a New Yorkextradition order.   Hatcher, 31, is being held in San Francisco in lieu of $1million bail and an extradition hearing is scheduled for Friday.Hatcher had sought refuge on a reservation in Idaho. He later askedthe Soviet consulate in San Francisco for political asylum but hisplea was rejected and he was arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
