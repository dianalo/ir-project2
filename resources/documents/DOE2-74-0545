This opens up a new venue forexploration, one which lends itself very well to seismic surveys. Internalstructure in the mounds is such that they can be readily subdivided intofive main facies. Mound growth starts with the development on the deepwaterplatform, of a basal biaclastic wackestone, probably as the result ofstorm currents. A bryozoan-crinoid community forms, building the moundcore and encasing itself in an early cemented crinoidal debris apron.The mounds eventually drowned and were covered with deeper water shales.In examining the diagenetic history of the mounds, it is suggested thatcementation by sparry calcite is the largest single influence on reservoircharacter. The best porosities and permeabilities are associated withthe Bafflestone Core and Crinoidal Debris Apron facies. Initial welltesting shows the reservoir appears to be ideal for steam injection.6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
