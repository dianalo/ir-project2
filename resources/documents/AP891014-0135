In a statement carried by Christian radio stations in Beirut,Lebanon, Christian Gen. Michel Aoun called on the deputies not to``make any commitment that would be viewed as a concession onsovereignty.''   ``The Lebanese people will have no mercy on anyone who makesconcessions no matter how important he is,'' Auon said.   The talks, aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war andrevamping the nation's government, entered their third week in thismountain resort Saturday.   Lebanon's Christian-dominated system of government was set upwhen the country gained independence from France in 1943. At thattime Christians were in the majority, but now Moslems make up 55percent of the population.   Conference sources expressed optimism that the Syrian questioncould be resolved if Aoun accepts an Arab League guarantee that theSyrians will withdraw their 40,000 troops from Lebanon under atwo-year timetable.   The draft peace plan by Arab League mediators envisages thephased withdrawal of Syrian troops from metropolitan areas to theeastern Bekaa Valley.   The final pullout would be left vaguely tied to the end of theIsraeli military presence in the country and a strong centralgovernment in Beirut that would sign a ``security pact'' with Syria.   Syrian troops are in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate. However, Aoun says they have lost theirmandate by openly siding with the Moslems in the civil war.   The meeting of the 63 deputies started Sept. 30. The lawmakershave announced several times they were on the verge of a peacesettlement, only to be frustrated by renewed demands from one sideor the other.   Said one source, ``They reach a consensus and then get atelephone call from Beirut, and we are back where we started.''   Pro-Syrian Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri and Druze warlordWalid Jumblatt have upped the stakes from Beirut each time Aoun'shard-line Maronite Christians demanded a quicker Syrian pullout andwritten guarantees from the Syrian government in Damascus.   The Moslems have concentrated on the power-sharing formula theArab mediators _ Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria _ have outlinedas a charter for national reconciliation.</TEXT></DOC>
