Three weeks before the United Nations deadline for Iraq towithdraw its armies from Kuwait or face a possible military strike,the Baghdad government recalled its ambassadors to the UnitedStates and some European nations for urgent consultations,diplomats said. No details about the talks were disclosed.   In the sands of Saudi Arabia and the waters of the Persian Gulf,hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops marked Christmas Eve withmuted celebrations and a heightened state of alert.   Underscoring the somber holiday mood among U.S. forces, thebodies of 20 of the 21 U.S. servicemen who died in the weekendsinking of an Israeli ferry were flown back to the United States onTuesday. The ferry capsized as it was transporting crewmen to theaircraft carrier USS Saratoga after shore leave.   So far, 81 U.S. servicemen have died in Operation Desert Shield,launched after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait nearly five months ago.   The readiness of U.S. forces to fight was the topic as DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney met Monday with President Bush. Cheney,returning a day earlier from a five-day trip to the Middle East,said American troops would be ``prepared today, if we were orderedtoday, to take military action.''   Saddam's newest threat against Israel came in a Spanishtelevision interview to be broadcast Wednesday. The journalist whospoke with the Iraqi leader in Baghdad on Saturday said Saddam toldhim ``Tel Aviv would receive the first blow in the case of a gulfwar,'' whether or not Israel joined any multinational strikeagainst Iraq.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir responded to the reportedthreat by telling Israel radio that Iraq ``will be harmed in a mostserious way'' if it attacks Israel.   The new threat against Israel appeared to be a fresh bid bySaddam to divide the anti-Iraq coalition, which includes some Arabnations traditionally hostile to the Jewish state.   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization,Israel's most implacable enemy, indicated in an interview publishedTuesday the PLO would side with Saddam if war broke out.   ``We have coordinated our plans to fight with Iraq in onetrench,'' PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's chief political adviser,Hani Al-Hassan, told the Iraqi daily newspaper Al-Jumhuriya.   Other Arab leaders, however, appealed to Saddam to give upKuwait before it is too late.   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, at a meeting of the Gulf CooperationCouncil in Qatar, said ``it is braver to opt for peace than forwar.''   Fahd said Saddam would find his gulf neighbors ready forreconciliation if he left Kuwait, urging that Saddam ``know thatthe curtain is not yet drawn on the scorching war and that he ...can spare himself and his people its horror.''   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told reporters in Cairo thatIraq would be the big loser if war breaks out.   ``A very large number of Iraqi people will die,'' he said. ``Thedecision of one man will lead to the death of hundreds ofthousands.''   The Baghdad government, meanwhile, has been holding urgentconsultations on the gulf crisis with Iraq's ambassadors to 10Western countries, Iraqi officials said.   The Iraqi Embassy in Washington said the Iraqi envoy to theUnited States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, and Baghdad's envoy to the UnitedNations, Abdul Al-Anbari, were among those summoned.   Iraqi envoys to a number of European nations were also recalledfor talks, officials said. It was unclear how many were involved.   In Saudi Arabia, a Moslem country that forbids the practice ofother religions, U.S. troops planned a subdued Christmas. Soldierswere to receive a special holiday meal of turkey, roast beef,cranberry sauce and other traditional dishes.   President Bush taped a Christmas message to American soldiersworldwide, which was being broadcast Monday.   ``The sacrifices you make will never be forgotten. America isbehind you. The world is behind you and history is behind you,'' hesaid.
