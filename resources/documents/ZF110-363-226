 In our quest to shed light onall things Mac, our coverage ranged from the sublime (the new Mac IIfx, inMay) to the ridiculous (a half-million-dollar UltraMac, in September).andP;  Toput 1990 in perspective and to give you a running start on 1991, we offerthis quick overview of MacUser's 1990 product coverage, along with a fewhints about what to expect in the year ahead.andP;  For a detailed directory ofproduct reviews in all categories, see the MiniFinders that appeared in theAugust issue (MiniFinders is also available on-line via Zmac).andM;AcceleratorsandM;In August MacUser Labs tested and dissected 30 accelerator and cache cardsthat can be used with most Macs.andP;  These products supersede the Mac's CPU (oradd math coprocessor and PMMU chips) and offer a substantial performanceboost.andP;  We found that Apple's own upgrades were competitively priced andsometimes clearly superior to other upgrade options.andP;  Apple's &quot;wicked fast&quot;IIfx upgrade (for Mac 22 and IIx owners) scored the ultimate five mice.andP;  OurMay issue included favorable reviews of two cache cards for the Mac IIci andMac II: DayStar's Fast Cache IIci and Dove Computer's Mara Thon Racer.andM;In March we tested four SCSI accelerators to see how much they speed up datatransfer between the Mac's CPU and a hard-disk drive.andP;  The winner?andP;  Therewasn't one--none of these specialized NuBus boards did much more than put adent in your wallet.andP;  However, these boards were pushing fast DMA (directmemory access) long before Apple officially sanctioned it, so we may seeimprovements on these products in 1991.andM;CADandM;A wave of flashy, powerful computer-aided-design software arrived in 1990.andO;In August we surveyed the professional CAD packages available on the Mac.andO;Although many of these packages are adapted for use in specialized markets,the majority offer 2-D and 3-D tools for a broad range of industrial design.andO;After examining products from 60 companies in various categories, wesuggested you look at AutoCAD, Ashlar Vellum, MicroStation Mac,DynaPerspective, and Architrion II or put together a combination of packagesto suit your specific nees.andP;  Some of the newer programs deliver numericmachine control, animation, or photorealistic image-renderingandgt; many alsoprovide output to color printers, plotters, and video recorders.andP;  Reviews ofCAD products also appeared in March (Super 3D, Swivel 3D, Origins), April(Aperture), May (StrataVISION 3d and Ashlar Vellum), July (Blueprint), August(Radius QuickCAD Graphics Engine), and October (MacDraft).andM;CPUsandM;The superfast Mac IIfx workstation and three entry-level, affordable Macsmade their debut this year, but so did GUI (graphical user interface) kidstuff -- namely, Windows 3.0 for IBM PCs and compatible computers.andM;In May we turned our spotlight onto Apple's newest high-end Mac, the IIfx.andO;With some slick microchip engineering and speedy video refresh, the IIfx isthe computer for the most power-hungry power user.andP;  A $2,999 IIfx upgrade forthe original Mac II offers a relatively painless way to maximize performance.andO;In 1991 and beyond, many of the IIfx's high-performance features will beavailable in more-affordable Macintoshes.andM;In September we profiled some serious competition to apple's elegant MacPortable: the Outbound Laptop System, Colby SE/30, and Dynamac SE/30.andO;Despite being the heavyweight, the Mac Portable survived our road tests andled the pack with a 4.5-mouse rating.andP;  Apple and Outbound clinched a midyeardeal, however, with Apple officially sanctioning Outbound's light, modulardesign.andP;  With sluggish sales of the original Mac Portable configuration,apple has dropped the price a full $1,000.andM;Also in September, we compared Windows 3.0 (Microsoft's mousey new graphicaluser interface) to the Macintosh's Finder and operating environment.andP;  Ourauthors, with many years' experience using both PCs and Macs, declared a tiefor raw performance (at similar prices).andP;  The Mac was a solid winner in theease-of-use and functionality categories, but Windows 3.0 had the edge inaffordability.andP;  Apple's new System 7.0 and Microsoft's OS/2 (withPresentation Manager) for high-end PCs may turn 1991 into an interfacebattleground.andM;&quot;In Search of the Ultimate Mac&quot; (September) highlighted two monster Macssurrounded by an overwhelming wish list of pricey, high-powered peripherals.andO;For those of us on a real-world budget, the article also included a soupe-upMac Plus.andP;  Finally, Apple's long-awaited introduction of low-budget Macs (see&quot;Three Cheers for Three New Macs,&quot; in this issue) helped dispel suspicionthat the Mac has evolved into a computer for the well-heeled.andM;ConnectivityandM;Superfast networks and efficient mainframe links are no longer the impossibledream for corporate Mac users.andP;  In our May comparison of two active-starconcentrators for use on LocalTalk networks, Farallon's StarController edgedout Nuvotech's TurboStar.andP;  In June our Networking Buyer's Guide offered acomplete education in connectivity concepts, technology, and availablehardware/software.andP;  Articles included &quot;How to Set Up the Perfect Network,&quot;&quot;Are You Ready for Ethernet?&quot; and &quot;EtherTalk-to-LocalTalk Routers.&quot;andP;  In thisissue, &quot;The Invisible Bridge to Mainframe Data&quot; looks at three products thatconnect your spreadsheet and database applications to your companymainframe's vast data resources.andP;  As lively as the connectivity market was in1990, it will surely accelerate in 1991, as Macintoshes continue to invadecorporate networks.andM;In Bridges, our monthly section dealing with networking issues, we discussedfile-transfer software, fax modems, and the finer points of TCP/IP and UNIX.andO;In 1991, Bridges will continue to help Mac users adapt to multiplatformenvironments.andM;Databases and FormsandM;Although still catching up to established PC systems, relational databaseprograms for the Mac offer improved speed and sophisticated features.andP;  InJanuary our coverage of forms-management software showed how such programscan combine database links and graphic-design tools.andP;  We reviewed SmartForm,TrueForm, and Fast Forms and peeked at several programs about to be released.andO;The September issue contained favorable reviews of Fast Forms and the newerInformed Designer.andM;Our June issue featured the four strongest Mac databases:4th Dimension, Omnis5, Double Helix 3.0, and FoxBASE+/Mac.andP;  All received positive reviews, with4th Dimension earning a five-mouse rating.andP;  In later issues, we reviewed FileForce (September), Acius' new midlevel database software that's compatiblewith 4th Dimension, and C*A*T III (October), relational-database software formarketing-contact management.andM;Desktop PublishingandM;After much anticipation, quality color and prepress capabilities are finallywending their way to the Macintosh.andP;  Our May issue offered a comprehensivelook at color publishing on the Mac, from input technologies throughprocessing techniques to output options.andP;  In our monthly DTP section, wediscussed the rapidly evolving fields of color calibration (March) andprepress links (November) and questioned whether Pantone works as anelectronic color standard (May).andP;  The DTP section also provided sage adviceon choosing a service bureau (May), handling registration problems and colorproofing (July), auto-tracing and generating outline fonts (August), andchoosing a type-manipulation program (see &quot;Type&quot; in the DTP section in thisissue).andM;The page-layout market was also in high gear during 1990.andP;  In January ourreview of then-current contenders gave the nod to QuarkXPress over PageMakerand Ready, Set, Go'.andP;  At year's end, that recommendation stands, despite aplethora of upgrades and new products.andP;  Besides the impressive QuarkXPress3.0 (reviewed in November), other new high-end releases we reviewed includePageMaker 4.0 (September), DesignStudio (June), and RagTime (June).andP;  In 1991long-document publishing should finally gain a foothold on the Macintosh,thanks to Mac releases of FrameMaker (reviewed in November) and VenturaPublisher (scheduled for release this month).andM;Display SystemsandM;In April we tested 19 monochrome Mac display systems.andP;  Apple's 15-inchPortrait Display was our first choiceandgt; runners-up included RasterOps'ClearVue, Sigma Designs' 19-inch L-View and 21-inch SilverView, and the AppleTwo-Page Monochrome.andM;Our May Buyer's Guide examined 18 full-color display systems and gave athorough technical overview of hardware and software variables that affect apurchase.andP;  Our small-screen favorites were the E-Machines ColorPage T16 andApple High-Resolution RGB.andP;  Among the large-screen displays, we recommendedthe RasterOps 708+ Display and the SuperMac 19&quot; Trinitron Color Display.andM;&quot;The Golden Age of Gray Scale&quot; (October) reported on tests of gray-scaledisplay systems from CalCamp, Radius, RasterOps, and SuperMac.andP;  All performedwell, but the SuperMac 19&quot; Platinum Display earned a five-mouse rating.andO;Unless another vendor offers similar quality for less money, SuperMac willremain the gray-scale leader in 1991.andM;GraphicsandM;The Macintosh's numerous graphics file formats -- PICT, TIFF, EPS, and soforth -- can be a major source of confusion.andP;  To help you sort it all out, weproduced the &quot;MacUser Guide to Graphics Formats,&quot; a pull-out poster in ourSeptember issue that contained a comprehensive glossary of file formats plusextensively researched information about format compatibility and conversioncapabilities for 43 applications.andM;In April we reviewed ten object-oriented drawing programsandgt; our picks includedCanvas for everyday use, FreeHand for type-intensive or mixed-format art,Illustrator for professional PostScript graphics, and Dreams for preciselydimensioned drafting.andP;  We also looked at Photoshop (July), a popular newcolor-retouching program.andP;  By early 1991, we should be seeing a newgeneration of graphics programs, including Illustrator 3.0, FreeHand 3.0,Studio/32, and some amazing new animation applications.andM;Money ManagementandM;In 1990 Mac software expanded its role in business accounting, especially forsmall- and moderate-sized companies.andP;  In March we analyzed five programs forpreparing federal income-tax returns.andP;  MacIn Tax Federal 1989 earned afive-mouse rating for its wide selection of forms, worksheets, and toolsandgt;1989 Personal Tax Templates, an inexpensive and customizable templatepackage, was the runner-up.andM;In May we reviewed 17 accounting packages and made recommendations forone-write, corporate, and consolidated systems.andP;  Our picks included atOnce],Mind Your Own Business, MultiLedger, Computerized Classic Accounting, andInsight.andM;OCRandM;Optical-character-recognition software now offers a wider range of&quot;intelligent&quot; features for text analysis.andP;  In July we examined the topcontenders in OCR software and gave the highest marks to OmniPage, withAccuText running a close second.andP;  For high-volume scanning, we suggestedlooking at Calera's TopScan or Caere's Parallel Reader.andP;  Mor recently, Caerehas announced Typist, a hand-held scanner with built-in OCR software thatscans a page and exports the text directly to any active Mac application.andM;PrintersandM;The past year saw better, faster color printing as well as higher-quality,less expensive black-and-white printers.andP;  In May we looke at the complexscience of color printing--including inkjet, thermal wax transfer, andsublimal-dye thermal transfer--and analyzed software that translatesPostScript images for non-PostScript color printers.andP;  We tested 14 colorprinters.andP;  The Tektronix ColorQuick was our favorite inkjet printer.andP;  The QMSColorScript 100 Model 10 (with PostScript) was tops among thermal waxprinters.andP;  The high-end Mitsubishi S340-10 wowed the crowd with sharp,realistic sublimal-dye colors (despite its $13,995 price and difficultsetup).andM;In September MacUser Labs reviewed Apple's new line of personal laserprinters and gave thumbs-up to the &quot;classy, inexpensive&quot; Personal LaserWriterSC and Personal LaerWriter NT.andP;  With increasing competition in the printermarket, we predict even lower prices in the future.andM;For our October issue, we thoroughly tested 19 PostScript printers.andP;  TheTexas Instruments microLaser PS35 came out on top in the personal-printercategory.andP;  The Dataproducts LZR 1260i won our vote for both DTP and corporateuse.andP;  We rated the higher-resolution Varityper VT600P best for camera-readyoutput that doesn't have to be &quot;magazine quality.&quot;andP;  In &quot;The Next Wave ofPersonal PostScript Printers,&quot; we previewed five soon-to-be-releasedPostScript contenders.andP;  We'll review these promising newcomers in upcomingissues.andM;In April MacUser Labs examined print spoolers--software that buffersLaserWriter and ImageWriter print files.andP;  SuperLaserSpool and SuperSpooltopped the list (both are now sold by Fifth generation).andP;  In November, weexamined the latest in QuickDraw printers.andM;ScannersandM;&quot;The Art of Scanning&quot; in the May Color Buyer's Guide surveyed scannertechniques and technologies and examined data-compression, color-correction,and image-manipulation software.andP;  In September MacUser Labs took an insidelook at 29 scanners in five categories: flatbed, sheetfed, overhead,hand-held, and slide models.andP;  The flatbed Microtek MSF-300Z proved best forcolor work, and the Agfa Focus II 800GSE topped the list for gray-scalescans.andP;  For very-high-resolution images, we chose the Truvel TZ-3 overheadscanner.andP;  Nikon's LS-3500 was judged the best slide scanner, andThunderware's LightningScan emerged as the best hand-held scanner.andM;Charts and StatisticsandM;In January we explained how to create drawings prevalent inbusiness--organization charts, programming plans and procedures, andflowcharts.andP;  The three software packages reviewed -- DiagramMaker, MacFlow,and TopDown -- all earned four-mouse ratings.andP;  A recent upgrade may putTopDown at the head of the class, however, look for a review in an upcomingissue.andM;In April we looke at four heavy-duty statistical-analysis programs: DataDesk, Exstatix, JMP, and StatView.andP;  Citing the diverse qualities of theseprograms, we found no clear winnerandgt; instead, we recommended carefullymatching their strengths to your needs.andP;  In November we followed up with areport on three high-end statistics packages.andP;  We liked SYSTAT for itsMac-like interface and SPSS for its wide range of functions, and werecommended Minitab for users with limited funds and hardware.andM;StorageandM;In 1990, the options for affordable mass data storage multiplied -- as didthe risks of losing data.andM;Magnetic Hard-Disk Drives.andP;  In February we examined the speed, reliability,service/repair options, and bundled software of 101 hard-disk drives withcapacities of up to 100 megabytes.andP;  The Jasmine DirectDrive 40 and MicrotechNova 40, which both used the Quantum ProDrive 40S mechanism, were ourfavorites.andP;  Jasmine now sells its direct drive with a Fujitsu mechanism.andO;Both Jasmine and Microtech sell their products by direct mail-order only.andP;  Werecommended Apple's expensive 80-megabyte Hard Disk 80SC and the 40-megabyteHeart HD 1040 for people who prefer the convenience and security of buyingfrom a retail outlet.andP;  In this issue, look for our picks in big, fasthard-disk drives (see &quot;Moving Up to a Big, Fast Hard-Disk Drive&quot;).andM;March's &quot;To the Rescue&quot; showed you how to cope with disaster -- floppy-disk-and hard-disk-drive crases, data loss, corrupted desktops and drivers, andeven dreaded SCSI termination.andM;Optical Drives.andP;  The year 1990 brought important news in optical media.andO;Although read-only compact discs may slowly replace traditional booklibraries, erasable optical discs now offer the most economical mass storageoption.andM;In March we reviewed six CD-ROM players.andP;  The CD Technology Porta-Drive andthe more expensive Toshiba XM-3201 A1 MAC rated four-and-a-half mice.andO;Apple's AppleCD SC and Optical Media International's OMI ProCDP ratedslightly lower.andP;  Our conclusion: &quot;Speed will improve in the next few years,but it will never approach that of hard drives or nonstandard optical media.&quot;andO;That is, CD-ROM has emerged as an effective distribution medium but is not aspractical in daily data retrieval as are other media.andM;In November we tested 20 erasable optical drives.andP;  The fast FWB HammerDisk600S and the Storage Dimensions MacinStor were our favorites.andP;  The drives wetested showed that cost-effective erasable optical technology has arrived.andO;Next year will bring a battle between them and the established,lower-capacity SyQuest removable-hard-disk drives.andM;Floppies.andP;  Macs have learned to read DOS disks, including the high-density3.5-inch variety.andP;  In February we tested four drives that read high-densityIBM and Mac floppy disks.andP;  The now-standard Apple FDHD SuperDrive tied withthe Kennect Drive 2.4 (with Rapport controller) for first place.andP;  The popularDaynaFILE drive was a close second (Dayna's DOS Mounter software also letsthe Apple and Kennect drives appear as Finder icons).andM;TelecommunicationsandM;Modems are going from fast to faster, but the fastest aren't necessarilyreliable or even compatible with each other.andP;  In January, MacUser Labssubjected eleven 9,600-bps modems to an exhaustive suite of tests.andP;  Thewinners were the CONNECT V.32 Service, Racal-Vadic 9632VP, and U.S.andP;  RoboticsCourier V.32.andP;  We also revealed that Microcom, Farallon Computing, and othermanufacturers would soon offer lower prices and built-in ISDN (IntegratedServices Digital Network) capability.andM;In July we surveyed the overall performance of five electronic-mail softwarepackages for all-Mac or mixed networks -- QuickMail's extensive feature listsgave it a narrow edge over Microsoft Mail -- and explored the mysteries ofrouters, bridges, and gateways.andM;&quot;On the Line with MacUser&quot; (July) was a friendly introduction and completeuser's guide to Zmac, the CompuServe on-line resource for MacUser andMacWEEK.andP;  Reviews of telecommunications software also appeared in March(America Online and Prodigy), May (White Knight), and June (MicroPhone II).andM;Word ProcessorsandM;Just when you thought that Mac word-processing programs were all grown up,developers borrowed features from page-layout programs, databases, andutilities.andP;  When we took a detailed look at Mac word-processing programs inFebruary, Microsoft Word and Nisus shared top honors.andP;  During 1990, our PowerTools section revealed ways to increase your word-processing productivity --see Power Tools in June, July, August, September, and this issue.andM;Looking Ahead.andP;  What's new for '91?andP;  With the introduction of System 7.0,expect to see applications that transparently share data (and a lot of bookson System 7.0).andP;  Voice input should also be hot -- it'll let you do thingssuch as add spoken memos to your files.andP;  And 1991 may be when we see a newlighter Mac portable and a workstation-quality 68040 CPU.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
