(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two American Indians accused of takinghostages at a a Lumberton newspaper were freed from jail under$100,000 unsecured bonds Tuesday and ordered not to set foot inRobeson County while awaiting trial.   Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, walked out of thefederal courthouse in New Bern to the cheers and hugs of about 35residents of the county, where they had protested alleged officialcorruption.   U.S. Magistrate Charles McCotter set the conditions for theirrelease after a 90-minute hearing. But he indicated he wasreluctant to free the two men, who are accused of taking up to 20people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1.   ``I don't know of a clearer case for detention because these areserious crimes,'' McCotter said before setting out a long list ofrestrictions for bond. But McCotter said a ruling by the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals last week, which held that Hatcher andJacobs had been denied a timely detention hearing after theirarrest, gave him no choice.   The conditions require Hatcher and Jacobs to stay out of RobesonCounty, avoid all contact with government witnesses, report dailyby telephone to federal probation officers and to return to theresidences of court-approved ``custodians'' by 9 p.m. daily.   Hatcher is to stay with an uncle, Jim Hatcher of Winston-Salem,who promised to give his nephew a job as a mechanic's helper.Jacobs is to live in Halifax County with a family friend, PatriciaRichardson, who said he could make and sell Indian crafts whilestaying with her family.   ``I've seen murderers and rapists let out on bond right away,but they put us through hell for the last five months,'' Jacobssaid as he left the courthouse.   Hatcher praised the support of fellow American Indians.   ``It shows there are more people than us who know what's goingon,'' he said.   Asked if Hatcher and Jacobs would cooperate with a state taskforce investigating their charges of drug trafficking by lawenforcement officers in Robeson County, defense attorney Bob Warrensaid, ``We've been cooperating with the task force, and willcontinue to.''   Hatcher and Jacobs previously had been denied bond three times _twice by U.S. Magistrate Wallace Dixon in Fayetteville, and mostrecently by U.S. District Court Judge Terence Boyle, in April.   Hatcher and Jacobs are scheduled to be tried on thehostage-taking and federal firearms violations next week in federalcourt in Raleigh, but Assistant U.S. Attorney John S. Bruce hassaid a delay is expected.</TEXT></DOC>
