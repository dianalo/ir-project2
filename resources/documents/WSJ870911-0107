The government's statement was a response to a parliamentary committee report that expressed health concerns about using irradiation to preserve and sterilize food. The committee held hearings on the issue earlier this year and heard testimony from many witnesses who claimed food irradiation was hazardous.    The government rejected the committee's proposal that wheat be dropped from a Canadian list of foods that may be irradiated. It said there is no evidence that irradiated wheat is hazardous, provided radiation dosage limits are respected.    In addition to wheat, irradiation is permitted for potatoes, onions, flour, ground spices and dehydrated seasonings. Health Minister Jake Epp said, &quot;The government sees no reason to alter current approved uses of food irradiation or to postpone the case-by-case consideration of any future applications.&quot; Asked if he would eat irradiated food, Mr. Epp said &quot;absolutely.&quot;    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April 1986 approved irradiation to disinfect spices, to destroy trichina infestation in pork and to disinfest fresh fruits and vegetables. However, the use of irradiation is very limited.    Food irradiation involves treating food with low-level doses of radiation. The radiation passes through the food and its packaging, killing insects and harmful organisms and bacteria.    Canada has pioneered the development of food irradiation equipment, partly because of a ready supply of the radioactive isotope cobalt 60, which is produced in the country's Candu-type nuclear power plants. Cobalt 60 provides the gamma radiation used in many irradiation plants.    Frank Fraser, vice president of the industrial irradiation division of government-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., said there is a potentially large world market for food-irradiation facilities. The company says it is the largest supplier of gamma irradiators used to sterilize medical products.    The Canadian government said it accepted the parliamentary committee's suggestion that irradiated foods be labeled with a symbol. But it said it hasn't decided yet whether to require as well the word &quot;irradiated&quot; on labels as proposed by the committee. It said the symbol will be the same circular one used in the U.S. and some other countries.    A government official said irradiation raises a &quot;challenge to regulatory enforcement&quot; because &quot;there are no known methods of determining whether a product has been irradiated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
