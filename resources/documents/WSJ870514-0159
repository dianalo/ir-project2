Market participants said this was the most open appeal by the ministry in memory. But they generally don't believe it will have any lasting, significant impact on exchange rates.    The ministry said it doesn't plan any new regulatory steps to enforce its wishes, but will rely on what one official termed &quot;moral persuasion.&quot; The ministry told financial institutions &quot;to use their own judgment in refraining from overly speculative dollar dealings.&quot;    Ministry officials met yesterday with chief executive officers of more than 20 Japanese commercial banks, 10 securities firms and 10 insurance companies. The ministry also met separately with representatives of 15 foreign banks.    Meanwhile, officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry met with representatives of numerous trading houses and manufacturers that engage in foreign-exchange transactions.    The Japanese government is worried that speculative selling of U.S. dollars could lead to further appreciation of the Japanese yen. Some analysts said authorities are particularly worried that monthly U.S. trade figures due to be released today could exert more downward pressure on the dollar.    Yesterday's appeal by the Finance Ministry followed recent efforts by the Bank of Japan to push domestic interest rates down through intervention in the Tokyo money market.    The Finance Ministry denied reports that it also has asked Japanese institutional investors to step up their purchases of U.S. government bonds. Japanese investors reduced their appetite for U.S. government securities in March and April, putting additional downward pressure on the dollar. There were conflicting reports about Japanese participation in last week's Treasury refunding auctions, but some observers said it was greater than expected.    The ministry also said it has not requested daily reports on institutions' foreign-exchange activities, as some reports suggested.    In Tokyo yesterday, the dollar rose 0.63 yen from Tuesday to close at 140.13 yen, after reaching a high for the day of 140.90 yen.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 140.25 yen, up from 139.85 Tuesday.    But there was considerable skepticism that the ministry's jawboning would have a lasting impact on the market. Even those who said the appeal may have a calming effect on the market added that today's U.S. trade figures could wipe out any influence of the ministry's remarks.    &quot;I see very little importance in this,&quot; said Yukuo Takahashi, chief foreign-exchange trader at Chemical Bank in Tokyo. &quot;First, you can't control markets by mouth. What we need is action. There is a huge (Japanese) trade surplus. What is needed are stimulative measures, but there aren't any coming out because the Diet (the Japanese parliament) is in a stalemate&quot; on several issues related to tax reform.    He added, &quot;Today, there was a lot of covering of short (oversold) positions. People can sell from here on. The downside movement could be precipitous.&quot;    A Bank of Tokyo spokesman said the ministry's appeals won't significantly affect the bank's operations. &quot;We haven't engaged in foreign-exchange speculation up till now,&quot; he said.    The ministry could have an impact on exchange rates by taking concrete steps to put pressure on market participants. One trader in Tokyo said that requiring institutions to give daily details of their foreign-exchange transactions would represent a significant increase in market controls. He noted it would give the Finance Ministry a better idea of &quot;who is shorting the market,&quot; or engaging in short-selling of dollars.    At present, foreign-exchange dealers are required to give turnover figures every 10 days to the Bank of Japan. And once a month, they are required to report their net position to the central bank. </TEXT></DOC>
