The official Xinhua News Agency said warrants were issued fordissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, who were charged with``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda andinstigation.''   The State Department said Tuesday that Fang and Li took shelterat the U.S. Embassy after the army rolled into central Beijing andopened fire on demonstrators June 3-4.   Military attacks that left hundreds dead ended seven weeks ofprotests that spawned demonstrations nationwide and caused a powerstruggle in which hard-liners emerged in charge.   The Chinese Foreign Ministry has strongly protested the U.S.decision to grant sanctuary to Fang.   The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the Xinhuaannouncement. Fang already was at the center of a U.S.-Chineseconflict in February when police barred him from attending a banquetgiven by visiting President Bush.   James R. Lilley, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, declined todiscuss Fang's case when asked about it in a telephone interviewbroadcast Sunday on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.'' He gave noindication he was aware the government issued arrest warrants forFang and his wife.   The news of the warrants came as the government intensified itsefforts nationwide to round up students and workers who led thedemonstrations demanding a freer society and an end to corruption.   A heavy troop presence in the capital remained on Sunday, and thegovernment kept up its propaganda effort to blame last week'sviolence on protesters, urging citizens to turn in anyone suspectedof involvement.   ABC News quoted Chinese sources as saying police arrested anotherleading dissident, Ren Wanding. Ren, 44, an accountant, was jailedfrom 1979-83 for helping lead an earlier pro-democracy movement.   Beijing Communist Party chief Li Ximing reportedly named him asan instigator of the latest student movement in a report to thecentral government May 19, and Ren had told foreign reporters hefeared arrest.   Authorities in Shanghai said they arrested the leader of a``counterrevolutionary clique'' called the China Youth DemocraticParty, Weng Zhengming, and the head of an independent Shanghaistudent group, Yao Yongzhan.   They said Yao was arrested at the Shanghai airport as he tried toboard a Hong Kong-bound plane and was ``in the company of personnelof the consulate of a certain country.'' They did not identify thecountry.   The government has announced the arrest of only one Beijingstudent leader, Gua Haifeng, secretary of an independent studentgroup that organized hunger strike and marches by tens of thousandsof students. Other Beijing student leaders were in hiding.   Television news broadcasts showed dozens of people being arrestedand questioned by police at gunpoint in various cities. Many lookedas if they had been beaten, and the face of one man, identified as aleader of an independent labor union, was swollen so badly he couldbarely open his eyes.   One of those arrested was a man accused of ``rumor-mongering''for telling ABC that 20,000 people were killed in the militarycrackdown. China's national television broadcast network footage ofthe man Saturday and appealed to the public to turn him in. Itannounced his arrest Sunday in the northeastern city of Dalian.   In New York, ABC News said in a statement that it was ``deeplydistressed to learn that in this instance the Chinese authoritiesintercepted unedited news material that was being satellited andused it for political purposes.''   Laura Wessner, an ABC spokeswoman, said that last Monday, WorldNews Tonight used about eight seconds of the tape in a report bycorrespondent Jim Laurie and it was one of several man-on-the-streetinterviews.   She said she did not know how the raw footage was intercepted byChinese authorities, who broadcast one minute and nine seconds ofthe man's interview with ABC.   ``We intend to do whatever we can to protect the identities ofthose that we interview who feel their safety might be jeopardizedor at risk,'' Ms. Wessner said.   The government has said nearly 300 people were killed but thatmost were soldiers attacked by ``ruffians.'' Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence sources have said as many as 3,000 may havedied when troops fired on crowds of citizens.   The government issued no figure for the total number of arrestsnationwide, but partial figures issued by some cities totaled morethan 680.   At least one city, the northwest tourist city of Xian, orderedits residents to hand over foreign news reports of the attacks inBeijing. The city government said the materials contained``distorted propaganda.''   An unspecified number of students from neighboring Hong Kong andMacao were arrested in the southern Chinese city of Canton last weekafter they protested the Beijing crackdown, Thailand's consul inCanton, Wichai Vanasin, reported.   Chinese authorites were in full control of Canton after arrestingthe students from the British colony of Hong Kong and the Portugueseterritory of Macao, the consul said. Hong Kong is to revert toChinese rule in 1997 and Macao in 1999, and the violence in Beijinghas created concern in both.   Authorities in Beijing, which has been under martial law sinceMay 20, issued a new order Sunday calling on anyone who ``burnedarmy or police vehicles, public buses and other public vehicles, orplotted, organized or abetted in providing the conditions for suchatrocities'' to turn themselves in for lenient treatment, or expectharsh punishment.   Other cities issued similar orders and banned the independentgroups that led the protests.   In the northeast city of Changchun, authorities held a rallyparading 26 alleged lawbreakers ``so the public would ... beeducated.'' Mass rallies to parade and in some cases executesuspects were common elements of political control in the past buthad become less frequent in recent years.   No new protests were reported in any cities.   Student protesters in Shanghai had given the government untilSunday to open talks with them on democratic reform, publicize thetruth of the military attack in Beijing and fly flags at half-staffin honor of the Beijing dead. However, the deadline passed withoutnew student action.   The media stepped up its criticism of the U.S. government-runVoice of America radio station, accusing it of distorting thecrackdown.   The Shanghai government sent foreign consulates a letter duringthe weekend warning that foreign journalists there needed officialpermission to report. Foreign reporters in Beijing already arebanned from conducting interviews on the street and most otherplaces.</TEXT></DOC>
