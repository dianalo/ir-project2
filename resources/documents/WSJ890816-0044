That's the view of a growing number of oil analysts, who foresee a renewed weakening in oil markets unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries trims output.    OPEC production had been expected to come down some in the third quarter from the second-quarter level of more than 21 million barrels a day. But output for July remained at around 21.3 million barrels a day despite a second-half production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day.    This month, OPEC's output appears to be surging even higher. By most accounts, it is averaging between 21.5 million and 22 million barrels a day while demand for OPEC oil is generally estimated at around 20.5 million.    &quot;The erosion in oil prices is not likely to abate unless OPEC acts decisively to curtail production by containing leakage,&quot; said Michael Rothman, vice president and senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York.    In lackluster trading yesterday, crude oil prices were mostly higher. On European spot markets, North Sea crudes were generally around $17 a barrel, up 10 cents to 25 cents a barrel. In U.S. futures trading, the price of the September contract for West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $18.68 a barrel, up 10 cents.    Oil prices rallied last week and could rally again this week in the wake of the latest report by the American Petroleum Institute on U.S. oil statistics. The report, released yesterday after New York Mercantile Exchange trading had closed, showed big drawdowns last week in inventories of both crude oil and gasoline.    Still, there are signs that petroleum demand is turning sluggish, and crude prices are $1 to $2 a barrel lower than they were only a month ago. Many analysts now expect prices to fall further, although they differ over how much.    A month ago, Vahan Zanoyan, the senior director of the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co., accurately forecast the price slide that developed through early August. Now, he looks for sufficient downward pressure over the next three weeks to drop prices as much as an additional $1 a barrel. He said the futures price of WTI could fall to $17.50, or possibly even $17.    Antonio M. Szabo, a vice president of Bonner andamp; Moore Market Consultants, Houston, is more optimistic on crude prices. Still, he said, in the &quot;very short term,&quot; they will weaken further. &quot;We are going to test the below-$18 range for WTI once again,&quot; he said.    Several analysts suggested that the price declines should be enough to spur the oil ministers of OPEC toward new production discipline when they meet in Geneva starting Sept. 23.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices rose for the fifth consecutive session on concern over production disruptions. The September contract ended with a gain of 1.5 cents a pound at $1.215. In just five trading sessions since Aug. 1, the price of the September contract has risen a total of 11.4 cents. William O'Neill, vice president of research for Elders Futures Inc., New York, cited the 40-day strike at the Highland Valley mines in British Columbia, Canada, as one of the main reasons for the price advance. &quot;Talks have bogged down, and the principals may have to work out their problems themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;The mediator has other commitments, and a vacation {for the mediator is} coming up. Negotiations have been suspended at least until next week.&quot; The strike began July 9. A settlement had been expected for two weeks. Highland Valley is Canada's largest producer, at about 180,000 tons a year. According to Mr. O'Neill, the main stumbling blocks are the questions of wages and the practice of contracting out work by the refinery, which the union opposes. The Peruvian national miners' strike that began Monday has caused 25% to 50% of that nation's miners to leave their jobs, Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;The danger is that the strike will spread as time goes on,&quot; he added. Peru is the world's sixth-largest copper producer. Richard Hirsch, a trader at Sharps Pixley, Inc., New York metals brokers, said the Peruvian strike is having a strong impact -- even though it was expected -- because it actually occurred. &quot;Previous strikes had difficulty getting going,&quot; he noted. Mr. Hirsch said a threat by workers at a Mexican copper producer to go on strike on Aug. 27, along with the continued paralysis at the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, and the Highland Valley situation are contributing to copper's climbing price. Mr. O'Neill of Elders observed that, technically, the market was very strong, with the September contract having twice broken above the $1.20 level. &quot;This indicates that a test may be shaping up of $1.25 and even possibly of the life-of-contract high of $1.315 set back on March 3,&quot; he said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices rose across the board in response to the weather outlook and concern over the possible deterioration of U.S. crops. After the close of trading Monday, the government issued its weekly crop progress report, which shows that the nation's harvest was hurt in the past week by a lack of moisture, said Gerald Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Futures Inc., Chicago. He said the rally in soybeans reflected the concern over the prospect for reduced yields. He said: &quot;There's very little subsoil moisture in many areas in the Midwest,&quot; which need rains to sustain the plants through their final weeks of development. He added that without added rains, the market is going to &quot;tend to want to rally over the next week or so.&quot; Soybean-futures prices for August delivery rose 20 cents to $6.225 a bushel. Separately, the National Weather Service late Monday issued its closely watched 30-day forecast, which called for below-normal precipitation in the heart of the Corn Belt. Corn futures also benefited from rumors that Mexico plans to make a bid for 400,000 metric tons this week.    SUGAR: Futures prices extended Monday's decline, although on a smaller scale. The October contract eased by 0.19 cent a pound to 13.44 cents. The failure of India to buy 250,000 tons of physical sugar on the world market continued to affect the market, according to one analyst. London prices were weak, and this trend was reflected in New York, he said. Egypt was reported to have bought 70,000 tons or more of refined sugar and is expected to purchase an additional 20,000 to 30,000 tons tomorrow, the analyst said. &quot;However, this buying doesn't compensate for the lack of demand from a major nation, such as India,&quot; he said. Nevertheless, according to another analyst, the Egyptian buying did cushion yesterday's price decline. That indicates there continues to be strong underlying demand for sugar on price dips. </TEXT></DOC>
