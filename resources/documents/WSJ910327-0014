In recent weeks, two floor clerks suspected of being FBIagents were identified by the Commodity Exchange and theCoffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange and turned away when theyapplied for trader membership, officials at the two exchangessay. A third person suspected of being an FBI agent has beenallowed to stay on the exchanges' joint trading floor in theWorld Trade Center, &quot;but people aren't trading with him,&quot; oneexchange official says.</LP><TEXT>   The incidents show the depth of mistrust between the FBI-- which exchange officials say never notified them about anyundercover investigation -- and the futures industry. Threeyears ago, the FBI successfully planted undercover agents onthe floors of Chicago's two big futures exchanges withouttelling exchange officials there.   The Chicago investigation led to 48 indictments and morethan 30 convictions and guilty pleas for illegal tradingpractices, as well as several acquittals. More indictmentsare expected.   The New York exchanges' decision to unmask the suspectedfederal agents raises questions about how far the exchangesare prepared to go in policing the commodities markets. Boththe Comex, which is the nation's major gold-futures market,and the coffee exchange have federal mandates to police anddiscipline improper trading on their floors.   In one case, a suspected FBI agent was in the process ofbeing approved for membership on the Comex -- which wouldhave given him free reign in the gold and silver trading pits-- but was recognized by a member of Comex's regulatorystaff, exchange officials say. The Comex staffer reported tosuperiors that the applicant once worked in the federalgovernment under a different name. Despite the applicant'spleas -- &quot;You're ruining my life,&quot; he reportedly said at onepoint -- the membership application was turned down.   Yesterday, FBI agent Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman forthe bureau's New York office, declined to comment on whetherthe bureau is investigating trading practices on the New Yorkcommodities exchanges.   But officials and traders at the Comex, the coffeeexchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and New YorkCotton Exchange all are convinced the FBI is trying toinfiltrate their markets, just as it did in Chicago threeyears ago. &quot;Obviously, there was an attempt to get them in,&quot;one top exchange official, who asked not to be identified,said of the suspected agents.   In the Chicago undercover probe, agents worked on thefloor of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago MercantileExchange for more than a year before their investigation cameto light in January 1989.   A Comex spokesman wouldn't comment specifically on the FBIissue, saying only: &quot;By policy, we never comment onapplicants at the exchange. People get turned away for avariety of reasons.&quot; Similarly, the coffee exchange saidmembership applications involve &quot;significant confidentialinformation&quot; and that it wouldn't comment at the moment.   Exchange officials -- in explaining why they unmasked thesuspected FBI agents, rather than allowing them in thetrading pits -- say they felt compelled to do so because thesuspected agents filed misleading applications usingpresumably false names.   Traders at the New York exchanges say the two peoplesuspected of being FBI agents both had been clerks on thefloor of the New York Merc, working for the trading desk ofCoastal Corp., the big Houston-based oil company. The NewYork Merc is the nation's major oil-futures exchange.   One of the former Coastal clerks applied for Comexmembership as a local, or independent, floor trader severalweeks ago under an apparently assumed name, other traderssaid. During the application process, according to oneexchange official, the former clerk was &quot;spotted&quot; by anofficer in the Comex's compliance department, which ischarged with policing the exchange.   In addition, a cotton exchange compliance officer said heknew the applicant from their college days, when he aspiredto be an FBI agent.   Comex officials said yesterday that the application wasrejected.   Then, last week, another former Coastal clerk showed up atthe coffee exchange seeking membership as a trader, accordingto exchange traders. His application was also deemed to besuspect, and was tabled, coffee exchange officials said.   In Houston, a Coastal spokesman said the firm &quot;is notaware of any investigation.&quot;   A report that a suspected FBI agent was turned away byComex was first carried in Securities Week, an industrynewsletter. The newsletter said the incident &quot;broughtchuckles&quot; from some traders, but worried others who haveheard months of rumors about a possible FBI probe at the NewYork exchanges.   The New York Merc wouldn't comment specifically on the FBIissue. But its president, R. Patrick Thompson, released astatement yesterday affirming the exchange's commitment toenforcing trading rules. The exchange &quot;maintains a great dealof confidence in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission asa regulatory agency,&quot; Mr. Thompson said. The statement didn'tmention the FBI.   Mr. Thompson added: &quot;The success of our exchange dependson public confidence in the integrity of our markets. Wewould vigorously support the enforcement of appropriatepenalties against anyone found guilty of dealing dishonestlywith a customer or any other illegal activity.&quot;   The four main New York futures exchanges are already undergovernment scrutiny. In May 1989, investigators from theCFTC, the futures industry's main regulator, and otherfederal agencies swarmed over the New York exchanges, seizingrecords and issuing subpoenas to as many as 50 futurestraders. So far, the CFTC has brought civil charges againstmore than a dozen individuals and several firms for suchinfractions as trading ahead of customer orders. Threeindividuals have settled the charges, but most are fightingthem in court.   The continuing CFTC investigation is expected to yieldmore civil charges in coming months.</TEXT></DOC>
