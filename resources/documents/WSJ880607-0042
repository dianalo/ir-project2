Dole </HL><AUTHOR> James M. Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TEL </IN><G> CNG EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Victory Communications International of Scottsdale, Ariz., is one of the best-paid political-consulting firms in America. Through April, it received $3,146,413, most of it for a single telethon, from Republican Pat Robertson's presidential campaign.    Don Ringe, a Washington media consultant, can top that. He and his associates took in $3,485,927 from Sen. Bob Dole's campaign.    The Campaign Group, a little-known consulting firm in Philadelphia run by Neil Oxman and Thomas &quot;Doc&quot; Sweitzer, collected $2,655,800 from Sen. Albert Gore's campaign.    All three campaigns started with high promise, spent buckets of cash, and failed. But win or lose, it has been a good year for those ubiquitous dragomans of modern American campaigns -- the political consultants.    Through April, media specialists and pollsters for six major presidential candidates collected a total of $26,295,590, according to figures compiled for The Wall Street Journal by Aristotle Industries, a research firm. Millions of dollars more are still to be reported to the Federal Election Commission. In the federally subsidized presidential race this fall, each campaign will be permitted to spend $54,391,453.80, most of it taxpayers' money. Each will pump almost $25 million into media and polling.    Is all this high-tech spending really necessary? Are these consultants worth it?    &quot;For what they actually produce, probably not,&quot; says Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. &quot;But for the perceptions they create, absolutely. A candidate without a stable of consultants won't be taken seriously by the press or by financial contributors.&quot;    In a close general election, says political analyst William Schneider, the consultants' work is one of many factors that influence the outcome. In presidential primaries, he says, &quot;sometimes they come up with the devices and tricks to shape their man's image and get him recognized.&quot;    George Bush and Michael Dukakis think their consultants were worth hiring. After all, barring miracles, they're going to be nominated. Some of the losers may not be so sure. But no one -- with the exception of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a special force in American politics -- is prepared to campaign these days without spending millions for expert help and advice. And hardly anyone, especially the press, is eager to criticize the work of these people; they have become oracles, and reporters rely on many of them for inside information.    Consultants don't pocket all the money that flows to them. Much of it is paid out to broadcasters for airing those 30-second and 60-second commercials. Normally, the media consultant collects a 15% commission. Still, the take of the consultants in the Journal survey runs into the millions.    Sometimes the consultants do a lot to earn all this money; sometimes, nothing at all. It worked out both ways in campaigns waged this year.    Perhaps the most instructive was Richard Gephardt's. The Missouri Democrat planned his campaign and recruited his consultants more carefully than most. &quot;I talked to different consultants,&quot; he says. &quot;I talked to politicians who had hired these people. It was a very good education. I wanted people who could communicate what I wanted to say. I wanted people I could trust.&quot;    Mr. Gephardt settled on David Doak and Robert Shrum, who began crystallizing in 30-second commercials what Mr. Gephardt had been saying in 30-minute speeches. The heart of his campaign was his get-tough trade policy, aimed at forcing America's trading partners to open their doors to American goods. It was shaped into what most experts agree was the best TV commercial of the campaign -- the &quot;Hyundai&quot; spot. In it, Mr. Gephardt says Americans work hard to turn out cars for $10,000 each. But after taxes and tariffs, the car costs $48,000 in South Korea. &quot;How many Americans,&quot; he asks, &quot;are going to pay $48,000 for one of their Hyundais?&quot;    Between Christmas and New Year's Day, the Hyundai ad and a Gephardt biographical spot had the Iowa air all to themselves. The candidate climbed 30 points in the polls and went on to win the Iowa caucuses. Enter, then, the media specialists for his opponents. They ran ads questioning Mr. Gephardt's trade policies, and almost every night network TV news shows raised questions of their own. &quot;Your prize for winning this year,&quot; says William Carrick, the Gephardt campaign manager, &quot;was to get beaten up on TV.&quot;    After finishing a respectable second in New Hampshire, the campaign stumbled south to Super Tuesday badly strapped for cash. &quot;We had to bobtail the Hyundai ad so it wasn't nearly so successful,&quot; says Mr. Shrum, the consultant, &quot;and we had to dump the bio altogether.&quot;    The campaign collapsed. &quot;Nobody knew who I was,&quot; says Mr. Gephardt, almost wistfully. All told, he funneled $2,293,408 for TV commercials through Doak, Shrum andamp; Associates.    Money wasn't Pat Robertson's problem. He paid a staggering $5,280,825 for media and polling, more than any other Republican candidate. Most of it went to Victory Communications for a Sept. 17, 1986, closed-circuit telethon piped to 261 locations and watched by 160,000 devout Christians.    Michael Clifford, Victory's president, disputes the $3,146,413 figure the FEC says his firm was paid. &quot;Hey, we got $4.8 million,&quot; he boasts. &quot;We're the highest-paid consultants in America.&quot; Mr. Clifford believes the campaign would have done better -- it ended up with 46 delegates -- if Mr. Robertson had listened more attentively to his advice.    Then there is Bob Dole. In a katzenjammer campaign that is becoming a legend in its own time, he spent $3,485,927 for media. His consultant was Don Ringe.    Bob Ellsworth, Mr. Dole's original campaign manager, says Mr. Ringe was hired on the advice of Stuart Spencer, President Reagan's most trusted political consultant, and others. Mr. Ellsworth says that &quot;I was told&quot; -- but not by Mr. Spencer -- &quot;that Don Ringe was so good he elected Bill Clements governor of Texas by totally obscuring Clements' personality from the voters until it was too late to matter.&quot; Such a pitch was irresistible to a campaign with a candidate who, like Mr. Clements, sometimes lets his abrasiveness get the better of him.    Mr. Ringe says he signed a $40,000-a-month contract the day before Mr. Dole opened his campaign in his hometown, Russell, Kan. &quot;They told me exactly where the camera positions would be,&quot; Mr. Ringe says. &quot;When I got there, the positions had been moved back 60 feet. I had to scramble to find another lens.&quot; The film shot that day, others in the campaign say, was barely usable.    &quot;That was when the senior staff began having doubts about Don Ringe,&quot; says David Keene, a consultant through most of the campaign. It was, of course, Mr. Ringe's first day on the job. It got worse. &quot;No one had a handle on finances,&quot; says Mr. Ringe. &quot;They had virtually no idea how much they had. People would call me up and say, 'God, what's going on? Aren't you in the loop?' And I'd say I wish I could tell them. But there was no loop.&quot;    Mr. Ringe is recuperating at his country home in Virginia. &quot;I still feel whiplash,&quot; he says.    The successful candidates started early, raised as much money as the law allows and worked in comfortable harness with their consultants.    Lee Atwater, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, says he and his colleagues never had any doubts about their media consultant: They wanted Roger Ailes. &quot;He's the best,&quot; says Mr. Atwater, and nobody really disputes it.    By most accounts, Mr. Ailes -- whose experience goes all the way back to Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign -- makes TV commercials that are almost always adequate but rarely dramatic. He earned his keep in the final hours of the New Hampshire primary by putting on the air an ad charging Mr. Dole with straddling the volatile question of raising federal taxes. Mr. Dole, typically, had tried and failed to get an ad on the air earlier saying he wouldn't raise taxes. Mr. Bush rallied from his thirdplace Iowa finish to win New Hampshire; it was, to date, the campaign's most telling example of why consultants can make a difference.    What Mr. Ailes does best is coach candidates on how to run for office and how to behave on TV. &quot;He's superb at that,&quot; says one of his rivals, Baltimore's Bob Goodman. &quot;I've sent 20 clients or more to him over the years. I even sent my daughter, Robin, to him after she complained she didn't interview well for jobs. It worked. She got the job she wanted.&quot;    After Ronald Reagan's disastrous first debate with Walter Mondale four years ago, Mr. Ailes was called in to coach the president for the second debate. Mr. Reagan weathered that one and went on to win in a landslide. This year, George Bush's live TV confrontation with Dan Rather was a hallmark Ailes production.    Through April, Mr. Ailes and his associates were paid $4,486,969 by the Bush campaign.    The Dukakis consultants, Dan Payne and Ken Swope, both of Boston, can't begin to match Mr. Ailes in breadth of experience. Mr. Payne, the lead Dukakis consultant, worked briefly in Rep. Morris Udall's presidential campaign in 1976. Mr. Swope, recruited by Mr. Payne, says the best work he has ever done was for George McGovern's bittersweet campaign in 1984.    What does count, though, is that Mr. Payne has worked for Mr. Dukakis in Massachusetts. He and the governor are comfortable together. Mr. Payne gets the serious work, such as filming the Dukakis biography, a competent piece of work. Mr. Swope says he was hired to lighten and humanize the Dukakis image. He wants to produce commercials &quot;that would make your hair stand on end or leave you mistyeyed.&quot; After watching miles of Dukakis footage, he found the sort of thing he was looking for in clips showing the candidate talking about Central America and the plight of the homeless in the U.S. He prepared commercials on both.    Through April, Mr. Payne, Mr. Swope and their associates had been paid $5,373,322 by the Dukakis campaign. That is tops among all the campaigns. The Dukakis managers almost surely will hire one or more senior media consultants to work with Mr. Payne and Mr. Swope. Some of the big names in the business -- David Sawyer, Robert Squier, Mr. Shrum -- don't deny they're interested.    &quot;We'll have two real professional teams on the field,&quot; says Mr. Ailes.    The Dukakis people are going to need all the help they can get. Instructive is an Ailes line -- a bit of hyperbole, no doubt -- that Mr. Goodman says he will never forget. &quot;The difference between me and any other consultant,&quot; Mr. Ailes told a slackjawed Mr. Goodman, &quot;is I'll give my life for a client.&quot;    ---               Media and Polling: Who Got What -    Michael Dukakis    Harriet Yellin andamp; Dan Payne    (Media)                          $4,770,889    Evans/McNamara    (TV production)                     368,368    Ken Swope (media)                   234,065    Harrison andamp; Goldberg (polling)       295,442    TOTAL                             5,668,764    Pat Robertson    Victory Communications    (Telethon)                       $3,146,413    Goldberg/Marchesano (media)       2,031,252    Gary Lawrence (polling)             103,160    TOTAL                            $5,280,825    George Bush    Farrell Media andamp; Ailes    Communications (media)           $4,486,969    Market Opinion Research    (polling)                           648,726    TOTAL                            $5,171,695    Robert Dole    Multi Media Service and    Don Ringe (media)                $3,485,927    Wirthlin Group (polling)            477,909    TOTAL                            $3,963,836    Albert Gore    The Campaign Group    (media)                          $2,655,800    Garth Group (media)                 825,000    Raymond Strother (media)             52,411    Mellman andamp; Lazarus (polling)         102,196    TOTAL                            $3,635,407    Richard Gephardt    Doak, Shrum andamp; Associates         $2,293,408    Kennan Research (polling)           281,655    TOTAL                            $2,575,063    GRAND TOTAL                     $26,295,590   Sources: Federal Election Commission; Aristotle Industries.</TEXT></DOC>
