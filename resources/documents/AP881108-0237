The virus, believed spread by a computer science student atCornell University, clogged computers at universities and researchinstitutes by spreading via electronic mail networks and makingrepeated copies of itself.   ``Before this incident, students felt that security and privacywere somebody else's problems,'' Yee said Monday. ``Now that one ofour own has done this, I expect more in-depth discussion.''   Others queried in an informal sampling of top U.S. universitiessaid they believe most computer-science students have a fundamentalgrasp of proper ethical conduct. But several said computer advancesare moving so quickly that questions of right and wrong often havenot been discussed in depth.   ``Harvard takes very seriously the issues of moral and ethicalbehavior, not only in the area of computer science education, but inall aspects,'' said John Shattuck, vice president for government,community and public affairs at the prestigious institution.   ``I think there's a broad consensus among students and faculty atHarvard that tampering with major computer information systems is avery bad thing to do, and it can cause disruption within the wholesocial structure,'' he said.   At the same time, Shattuck said, ``I think the technology ismoving so rapidly here that it's somehow gotten ahead of thediscussion and careful weighing of principles, as reflected in theslow evolution in the law in this area. This case will certainlydraw attention to the questions.''   Eugene Mallove, spokesman and chief science writer for theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, said the virus incidentcompelled the school's authorities to reiterate their policy on themisuse of computers, which will be published Wednesday in the campusnewspaper, Tech Talk.   ``We're going to send out a message loud and clear that this isnot to be tolerated, this is not a matter to be taken lightly,'' hesaid.   The virus incident occurred just a few weeks after MIT held asymposium on ethics in high-technology fields, titled ``How to BeGood,'' although the specific question of spreading computer viruseswasn't discussed, Mallove said.   James Ball, director of computing facilities at StanfordUniversity, another key virus victim, said most students andresearchers were awed by the infestation and how easily it spread.   ``A lot of us have talked about what could have happened. If thishad been a malicious attack, it could have been a real disaster,''Ball said. ``For us, the reaction was wiping the sweat off our browand saying `woooh.'''   But Ball said that underlying ethical and legal questions aboutwhy spreading such a virus was wrong, or even whether it was wrong,haven't been discussed much, reflecting an important weakness in thediscipline.   ``There's a great deal of naivete among computer science people.They spend an enormous amount of their lives in front of a screen.Some are somewhat introverted,'' he said. ``Computer scientists, Idon't believe, have the foggiest notions about laws on things suchas copyright infringements.''   Still, Ball said, ``I think there's a general impression it waswrong. People were talking about the possibilities of fines andimprisonment. People realize the severity of the potential outcomefor people who do it, sort of like if I'm speeding and I see a crashwhere people burned to death.''</TEXT></DOC>
