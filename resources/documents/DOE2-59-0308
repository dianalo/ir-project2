The energy is calculated using the macroscopic-microscopicpart of the energy and the Strutinski shell correction, based on theWoods-Saxon single-particle potential, is taken as the microscopic part.The energy is analyzed in the five-dimensional deformation space, describedby the usual deformation parameters: {beta}/sub {lambda}/ ({lambda}=2,3, 4, 5, 6). The results explain in a natural way the simultaneous appearanceof both fission modes (with a low and high total kinetic energy of thefragments), observed recently for /sup 258/Fm. The important role ofthe reflection-asymmetric deformations of the nucleus in this explanationis stressed.</TEXT></DOC>
