Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN </CO><IN> BCY BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, former parent of the nation's second-largest thrift, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.    The filing by the Irvine, Calif., holding company had been expected since Tuesday, when federal regulators seized control of the company's main operating unit, insolvent American Savings andamp; Loan Association, of Stockton, Calif.    Financial Corp.'s petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., just before 4 p.m. PDT Friday, listed assets of $77.2 million and liabilities of $1.43 billion. However, the liabilities included about $1.2 billion of claims under about 75 lawsuits pending against Financial Corp.    Late Friday, a Los Angeles lawyer was appointed bankruptcy trustee for the company, whose remaining directors all resigned with the filing of the petition. The trustee is David A. Gill of the Los Angeles firm of Danning, Gill, Gould andamp; Spector.    After the seizure of American Savings, Financial Corp. has one remaining operating unit, a securities broker-dealer firm known as American Group Financial Corp. The unit, which has about 100 employees, sells mutual-fund and insurance products through brokers located in about 80 of the 186 American Savings branches.    Kenneth N. Klee, a lawyer with the Los Angeles firm of Stutman, Treister andamp; Glatt, bankruptcy counsel for Financial Corp., said he hopes that some value can be realized for creditors by continuing the operations of the broker-dealer unit.    However, Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, which has agreed to pump $550 million in new capital into American Savings and acquire the thrift with $2 billion of federal aid, apparently plans to launch its own campaign to market various financial services through American Savings.    It seems unlikely that Bass Group would be willing to allow Financial Corp.'s broker-dealer unit to continue operating in American Savings branches after its takeover, which officials hope will be completed within a few weeks. A Bass Group spokesman declined comment.    According to a certificate filed with the bankruptcy petition, Financial Corp. had a negative net worth of $419.6 million as of July 31, meaning its liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount, as figured under generally accepted accounting principles.    That figure indicates Financial Corp.'s condition has been deteriorating rapidly. At June 30, just one month earlier, the company's reported negative net worth was $387 million. At June 30, Financial Corp., on a stand-alone basis, reported assets of $76.4 million, but only $3.3 million of that amount were liquid assets in the form of cash or investment securities.    In its bankruptcy-law petition, Financial Corp. said its $77.2 million in reported assets included $65 million owed to the company by American Savings. Because federal regulators declared American Savings insolvent and now control the thrift, it is viewed as unlikely that the debt to Financial Corp. will be paid.    Financial Corp.'s list of its 20 largest unsecured creditors was dominated by representatives of holders of its publicly traded debt securities and by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., in its role as receiver for American Savings.    Four banks were listed in their role as trustees for four Financial Corp. debt issues totaling $84 million. The FSLIC's claim was listed as $44.6 million. Other unsecured creditors were listed as being owed amounts of $300,000 or less each.    In its filing, Financial Corp. said there are 12,212 holders of its common stock, 4,173 holders of two issues of preferred stock, and 1,511 holders of its debt issues. The vast majority of the company's security holders are individuals. Most institutional investors sold off their Financial Corp. holdings during the past four years, as the company's problems have become increasingly serious.    There was no trading in Financial Corp. shares Friday, but the stock closed Thursday at 12.5 cents, down 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    The acquisition of American Savings by Bass Group is subject to approvals by the Internal Revenue Service and the California state Sandamp;L commissioner. </TEXT></DOC>
