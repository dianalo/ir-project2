Proposed delegates would be subject to Israel's approval, and thegovernment would reject any Palestinian affiliated in any way withthe Palestine Liberation Organization, said spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.   ``With the help of Jordan and Egypt, and with good will, it willbe possible to choose a (Palestinian) delegation which will be atemporary representational body until the beginning of autonomy,''Ahimeir said in an interview.   Shamir's proposal was made public as the issue of peace withPalestinians caused increasing splits in the coalition Cabinet ofhis right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning Labor Party.   Some Labor Cabinet ministers have proposed talking to the PLOunder certain conditions. Others favor choosing Palestiniannegotiators by elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   But Shamir rejects both ideas, Ahimeir said, confirming Tuesdaynewspaper reports.   He said an interim autonomy plan granting Palestinians limitedautonomy should be established before elections. Palestinians couldthen hold elections for an administrative council that wouldnegotiate a long-term solution, he said.   Speaking to a visiting Socialist International delegation, LaborDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin raised the possibility of electionsMonday as a way to get around the impasse over the PLO, which Israelconsiders a terror organization bent on destroying the Jewish state.   ``With these political figures elected in the territories, wewill conduct negotiations concerning the interim period ... andfollowing a period of time we shall reach a discussion of thepermanent solution with Jordan representatives of the residents ofthe territories,'' Rabin said Tuesday.   Meanwhile, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of Labor said he supportsnegotiations with any Palestinian who agrees to give up terror andthe claim that Palestinian refugees have the right to return toabandoned homes in Israel, and accepts Israel's right to existwithin secure borders.   A spokesman for Shahal said Tuesday that once conditions were met``the PLO is no longer the PLO as we know it today.''   Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi, also of Labor, was quoted bythe Jerusalem Post as saying PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could be anegotiating partner if he were elected by Palestinians in theoccupied territories.   Yaacobi and Shahal added their voices to those of Labor's EzerWeizman and Motta Gur, both ministers without portfolio.   Shamir described Shahal's proposal as ``jibberish'' at a newsconference Tuesday where he restated his refusal to negotiate withthe PLO.   ``It is our determination not to talk to this body (the PLO)because they are opposed to peace with us,'' Shamir said.</TEXT></DOC>
