But that is precisely what Paul Fussell, a respected scholar of 18th-century and modern British literature, provides in the brilliant title essay of his new book &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb and Other Essays&quot; (Summit, 298 pages, $17.95).    Not surprisingly, the essay sent paroxysms of indignant rage cascading through the academy when it first appeared in The New Republic in 1981. From John Hersey and John Kenneth Galbraith to squads of lesser writers, the destruction of those cities has elicited all manner of self-righteous moralizing -- usually, it must be said, from people far, far away from the scene when the decision was made. Never mind that the only real alternative was to mount a full-scale invasion of Japan. As Mr. Fussell points out, the general principle is &quot;the farther from the scene of horror, the easier the talk.&quot; And indeed, this is an insight widely shared by those with hard experience: &quot;When I read that we will fight the Japs for years if necessary and will sacrifice hundreds of thousands if we must, I always like to check from where he's talking: It's seldom out here.&quot; That was from Lt. (j.g.) John F. Kennedy.    Mr. Fussell adapted the title of his essay from &quot;Goodbye Darkness,&quot; William Manchester's memoir of his service in World War II. Mr. Manchester wrote that when you think about the millions of lives that would have been lost had the Allies invaded Japan in 1945, you &quot;thank God for the atomic bomb.&quot; Mr. Fussell agrees, and his essay is an extended meditation on this disquieting thought. His central message concerns &quot;the importance of experience, sheer vulgar experience&quot; in influencing one's views about the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He should know. Having fought and been seriously wounded as an infantry soldier in Europe, he was scheduled to take part in the planned invasion.    It is nevertheless worth stressing that Mr. Fussell is not blind to the horror the bombing caused. Indeed, he quotes lavishly from &quot;Unforgettable Fire: Pictures Drawn by Atomic Bomb Survivors&quot; to engrave on his reader's mind just how horrible it all was. But neither is he blind to the horror that an invasion would have entailed. Drawing on various firsthand sources, he notes that military planners estimated that invading the main islands of Japan would have taken a full year and cost one million American casualties. Ten thousand kamikaze planes and more than two million men were prepared to defend the Japanese homeland. Even the elderly and women and children were to be called up and supplied with sharpened bamboo sticks. In other words, had the Allies invaded, &quot;universal national kamikaze&quot; was expected.    As Mr. Fussell's reflections on the atom bomb suggest, his great gift as a critic can be summed up as &quot;A Power of Facing Unpleasant Facts.&quot; The phrase comes from George Orwell, one of Mr. Fussell's literary heroes and a recurrent presence in these pages. While &quot;Thank God for the Atom Bomb&quot; is undoubtedly the most important essay in this collection of some dozen pieces on various literary and social topics, it is not the only one to rise to Orwellian heights of candor and courage in facing unpleasant facts.    In &quot;A Well-Regulated Militia,&quot; for example, Mr. Fussell joins the battle over gun control by scrutinizing the messages emblazoned on the facade of the National Rifle Association headquarters in Washington, D.C. A panel to the right of the entrance proclaims that &quot;The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot; But the left panel, instead of supplying the missing bit from the Second Amendment -- &quot;A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state . . .&quot; -- merely contains an innocuous list of the association's interests.    Mr. Fussell's novel suggestion is to take the Constitution seriously, that is, literally. Henceforth, he proposes, tongue only half in cheek, any person who chooses to possess a gun at home shall willy-nilly be deemed to have enrolled in the militia. And in order to insure that the militia be &quot;well-regulated,&quot; a stringent training program shall be instituted requiring &quot;at least eight hours of drill each Saturday . . . ample practice in digging simple defense works, like foxholes and trenches,&quot; etc., etc.    Not all the pieces in this volume are as distinguished as these two essays. Mr. Fussell has some trendy reflections on the Indianapolis 500 car race, and he delivers a cutesy report on what it was like visiting a nudist beach in the Balkans. But the book is nonetheless important reading. Like Orwell, Mr. Fussell regards cant as his main enemy. In the course of his title essay, he notes that &quot;the future scholar-critic who writes The History of Canting in the Twentieth Century will find much to study and interpret in the utterances of those who dilate on the special wickedness of the A-bomb-droppers.&quot; That scholar-critic will also find a signal and eloquent exception in much of the work of Paul Fussell.    ---   Mr. Kimball is a frequent contributor to The New Criterion and other journals. </TEXT></DOC>
