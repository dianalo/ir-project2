The Karen rebel sources and students fighting alongside themsaid at least 45 other soldiers were wounded in Wednesday'sfighting at Wan Kha. Two guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded,they claimed.   Wan Kha is in Burma across the border from the northern Thaiprovince of Tak.   The Karens are among a dozen ethnic-based rebel groups fightingfor more autonomy from Burma's government. The government hasintensified its offensive in recent months and seized several majorKaren bases along the Thai border.   Thai border police today also reported fighting at Yahjaw andChikaya in Burma's Mae Ramat district, near the border.   The police said about 750 Karens have fled the fighting into theMae Ramat district of Tak province.   On Tuesday, police said, Burmese troops crossed into Thailandand looted shops of rice, cooking oil and clothes.   In a statement dated May 9 and received in Bangkok today, Sen.Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, condemned the Burmesegovernment and called for international mediation to end thefighting.   ``We have been heartened by the news that the Cambodian civilwar might soon be resolved, but not 300 miles from the battlefieldsof Cambodia an equally bloody civil war is being fought in tragicobscurity,'' the statement said.   ``In Burma, a brutal military government which has beencondemned by the international community is escalating its war withthe armed Burmese opposition,'' it said.   ``The war needs mediation. The opposition desires it. Someone,the United States, the United Nations, or ASEAN (the Association ofSoutheast Asian Nations) should be able to provide it,'' thestatement said.   Moynihan accused the Burmese army of attacking rebel positionswhere thousands of students fled after last year's military coup.   Students were at the forefront of last year's nationwidecampaign for democracy. The army crushed the campaign after theSept. 18 coup.</TEXT></DOC>
