A nonlinear relationship between reductionin crypt cell survival and Ara-C induced animal lethality was observed,indicating that factors other than crypt cell toxicity contribute tolethality in conventionally-maintained mice. A dose of 100 mg/kg Ara-Creduced the fraction of surviving clonogenic crypt cells to 7 x 10{sup-3} without animal lethality. Maintenance of the animals on acid waterbefore and after Ara-C treatment reduced animal lethality substantially.The magnitude of the reduction of clonogenic crypt cells was incompatiblewith S-phase specific toxicity as the only cytotoxic mechanism, and suggestedthat cell recruitment and crypt cell kill due to unbalanced growth arealso operative during Ara-C infusion. In addition, the detection of asubpopulation of clonogenic crypt cells which was resistant to killingby Ara-C has important clinical implications and warrants further investigation.These results are substantially different than those found after radiationwhere, with high radiation doses, the fraction of clonogenic crypt cellsdecreases exponentially, and where a close relation between reductionin clonogenic crypt cell survival and animal lethality has been established.</TEXT></DOC>
