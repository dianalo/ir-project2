The news eased fears that the economy wasslipping into a recession.   The report also contained good inflation news. A closely-watchedgauge tied to the GNP indicated inflation did not worsen during thesecond quarter despite the strength in the economy.   But on Wall Street, the news ``was a non-event,'' said marketanalyst Michael Metz of Oppenheimer andamp; Co.
