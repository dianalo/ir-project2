PAUL, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pickets were peaceful Wednesday as strikingcoal miners assessed a breakthrough in negotiations that followedviolence the day before.   United Mine Workers and Pittston Coal Group Inc. representativesagreed to sit down with federal mediators to discuss theircontract, and a mediator with the U.S. Labor Department's Mediationand Conciliation Service discussed the ground rules and agenda withunion and company officials Wednesday.   Neither a date for a meeting nor the principal negotiators havebeen agreed upon by both sides.   ``I always thought somebody else would have to step in,'' saidSidney Burden, a striking miner who has worked for Pittston for 42of his 64 years.   About 1,500 miners in Virginia and West Virginia had beenworking without a contract for 14 months when they went on strikeApril 5.   Burden, sitting along the picket line, said he hoped anagreement could be reached quickly. ``The longer it goes on theworse it's going to be,'' he said.   Tuesday, violence broke out as trucks were hauling coal from aPittston mine to one of the company's processing plants near St.Paul, 100 miles from the southwestern tip of the state.   A coal truck and an escort pickup truck were pelted with rocksthrown by striking miners, according to state police spokesmanCharles Vaughn. One hurled rock broke a driver's jaw and anotherknocked a driver unconscious, said Pittston Coal Group PresidentMichael Odom.   The coal truck then ran into striking miners and collided with aparked truck with miners inside, injuring seven strikers, two ofthem seriously.   UMW President Richard Trumka suggested a seven-day cooling-offperiod beginning Wednesday during which Pittston would stop haulingcoal and strikers would halt demonstrations.   Odom said Wednesday that Pittston will not stop production.</TEXT></DOC>
