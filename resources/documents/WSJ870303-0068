The dollar was higher against most major currencies besides the pound, but it failed to break out of its narrow trading range of the past two weeks. The U.S. unit's recent sluggish movements against its major counterparts, combined with higher interest rates offered for sterling-denominated investments, were largely responsible for the pound's rise, dealers said.    &quot;Sterling seems to be the only currency where there's any (investor) interest at all,&quot; said Trevor W. Woodland, a vice president at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago.    Sterling's strength also was attributed to trader optimism about the British political climate.    Recent inactivity in the usually dominant and more-volatile trading of dollars for West German marks helped divert attention to the pound, dealers said. They cited sharply decreased opportunities to make trading profits in their most liquid market. Trading activity and exchange-rate movements between the dollar and the mark have slowed since the six major industrialized nations announced an agreement last month aimed at stabilizing currency values.    With sterling-denominated investments yielding more than dollar-denominated ones, the pound became an attractive alternative. &quot;The view is that if you have stable currency rates, then you cash in on the high-yield currencies,&quot; said Leslie A. Puth, a trader at Credit Suisse, New York.    Sterling three-month Eurodeposits yielded 10 5/8% yesterday, in contrast to 6 6/16% for similar dollar deposits and 4% for a like German mark investment.    In late New York trading yesterday, the pound stood at $1.5643, up 1.1% from $1.5480 Friday. And sterling's rise was sharper against its European counterparts. Against the bellwether West German unit, the pound surged 1.7% to 2.8741 marks, from 2.8263.    Mr. Woodland of Harris Trust also cited &quot;a reduced intervention risk&quot; in selling dollars for pounds. Some participants in last month's Paris meeting of finance ministers from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada have said their agreement to stabilize rates includes plans for intervention to oppose any sudden moves in dollar exchange rates. Many traders interpret the stance as relating only to the crucial dollar-mark and dollar-yen rates. Therefore, &quot;If you want to sell dollars, you may as well buy sterling,&quot; Mr. Woodland said.    Traders also see some positive developments for the political fortunes of Britain's ruling Conservative Party. The government is expected to release a budget this month that likely will result in reduced public-sector borrowings and possibly a tax decrease, traders said. Some analysts also are encouraged that the Labor Party, the Conservatives' chief rival, failed to win a special parliamentary election last Thursday.    In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.8373 marks, from 1.8258, and to 153.70 yen, from 153.18.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar was unchanged against the Japanese currency, at 153.70 yen quoted in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $1.80 an ounce to $403.60 in light trading estimated at two million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $403.40 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                        New York     Home Mkt.   New York                           Mon.        Mon.
