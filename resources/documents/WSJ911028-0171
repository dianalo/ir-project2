September orders for U.S.-made machine tools climbed 3.4%from August, to $243.7 million from $235.8 million, accordingto the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a tradegroup. Orders were off 7.8% from September 1990.</LP><TEXT>   The improved demand for factory machinery, coming at thesame time as a two-month decline in durable goods orders,reflects the fragmented recovery. After faltering earlierthis year, manufacturers seem determined to invest inmetalworking machinery in hopes that consumer spending willrecover in the next few months.   However, while large companies, particularly those in theaerospace and power generation industries, remain dedicatedto long-term investment programs, small jobshops that aremore sensitive to the economic cycle remain cowed. &quot;We'restill dealing with some pretty small figures,&quot; said Daniel J.Meyer, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., a machine toolmaker. &quot;It's certainly encouraging, but people by and largeare unwilling to spend money yet.&quot;   As in previous periods, orders were aided by foreignmanufacturers. Domestic orders in September improved only0.7% from August, while foreign orders jumped 20.4%. &quot;Theworld economy has played a big role,&quot; said David D. Hale,chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.Although Mr. Hale believes moderate improvement in consumerspending in the next few months could lead to strong growthin equipment purchasing next year, a protracted consumerpessimism could cause another slump in capital spending.   Because the machine tool industry is under $3 billion ayear, monthly orders are volatile and sometimes misleading.However, orders for machine tools, which are large andexpensive pieces of machinery that cut and form metal partsfor manufactured goods, offer a glimpse at manufacturers'optimism.   &quot;The indication is things are moving in the rightdirection,&quot; said Evan W. Barrington, an economist withGeneral Electric Co., a major purchaser of machine tools. Ina recent survey by the National Association of BusinessEconomists, more than half the respondents said they wereaccelerating capital spending plans.   For the third quarter, machine tool orders were $609.7million, off 6.4% from the second quarter and down 20% fromthe 1990 third quarter. Shipments in September were $213.5million, up 16.4% from August's $183.4 million.   ---                Sept. 1991      Aug. 1991     Sept. 1990                                                                                                          Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines:                                                                                                        Domestic ... $149,550,000   $117,300,000   $190,750,000 Foreign ....   23,350,000      9,100,000     18,400,000   Total ....  172,900,000    126,400,000    209,150,000   Nine-month total for 1991: $1,291,750,000; for 1990:$1,573,150,000.
