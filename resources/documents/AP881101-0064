A newspaper reported today that two rangers were seriouslywounded in the battle Sunday night with about 30 poachers at MeruNational Park, 140 miles northeast of the capital Nairobi.   The poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos' horns, whichcan sell for up to $24,000 each in the Far East, where they areused to make traditional medicines. In the Middle East, the hornsare fashioned into ornamental dagger handles.   ``People watched over them day and night,'' a Kenyan wildlifesource said of the rhinos. ``The rangers were wounded trying todefend them.''   According to today's English-language newspaper The Standard,two rangers were seriously injured in what it described as a 45minute attack.   Five rhinos were killed, said George Muhoho, minister of tourismand wildlife. Several wildlife experts, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, put the number at six.   Thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week indifferent areas, the wildlife sources said.   The killings came despite increased anti-poaching efforts by thegovernment since August, when Muhoho revealed the slaughter of 92elephants in the previous three months and the government launcheda highly publicized campaign to stop the killing.   The white rhinos, which unlike the black rhino are notindigenous to Kenya, were imported from South Africa about 20 yearsago to start a colony and lived under guard in a special reserve inthe park. There still are an estimated 30 to 40 white rhino onprivate ranches in Kenya.   The white rhino's numbers have not been reduced as sharply ashave those of the black rhino, which were thought to number morethan 60,000 in the early 1970s. Today the black rhino, numberingabout 800 throughout Africa, is considered an endangered species.   Most of Africa's white rhinos live in South Africa, whereexperts estimate the herd at about 3,000 strong. Twenty-five to 30of the animals live in a private park in Solio Ranch, near theequator southeast of Mount Kenya, according to the Daily Nationnewspaper.   Both types of rhino are a rather dark gray, with their visibledifferences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape. The whiterhino's horn is longer.   Kenya sent a paramilitary unit to Meru National Park to trackthe rhinos' poachers, said a government wildlife source. Hedeclined to provide details.   Gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks offfive elephants in southeastern Tsavo East National Park and eightelephants in the arid Mathews Range 155 miles north of Nairobi, thesources said.   Their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since April,according to published data. Wildlife officials estimate the tollis much higher.   Studies by the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program showthat in the past 15 years, Kenya's elephant population has dropped85 percent. An aerial survey in February of Tsavo Park and itsenvirons found fewer than 5,500 elephants, down from 35,000 in 1974.   Experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an all-time high ofivory prices, which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s andaverage about $82 per pound.</TEXT></DOC>
