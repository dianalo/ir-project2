Radiologic studiesshowed a diffuse sclerotic lesion at the distal end of the right femurwithout evidence of fracture; the lesion was believed to represent anosteosarcoma. Plain films and CT studies were highly suggestive of thediagnosis, but the radioisotope scan was normal; this feature was importantin considering the case retrospectively. An open incisional biopsy ofthe lesion showed histologic features consistent with an old, slowlyhealing infarct which, over a period of 4 years, showed only minimalradiologic change. The radiologic clues relative to the diagnosis ofan infarct have been analyzed by the authors and the pathologic featuresdiscussed in depth. It was noted that the radionuclide bone scan providedthe only clue to the correct diagnosis. Review of the English literaturedemonstrated no reported example of an infarct of a long bone in a patientwith an immature skeleton with no underlying metabolic or hematologicdisorder.
