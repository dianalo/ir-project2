Introduction and Background </ITAG>The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (Pub. L.99-240) (the Act) was enacted January 15, 1986. Subsections (1) and (2)of section 5(c) of the Act contain a formula for allocating to each commercialnuclear power reactor specific volumes of disposal capacity. Under theformula, a reactor may receive an allocation for the ``transition period''between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1989, and another allocationfor the ``licensing period'' between January 1, 1990, and December 31,1992 (together the ``interim access period''). These ``regular'' allocationsof disposal capacity, which do not require petitions to DOE, may be usedto dispose of low-level waste at any of the three currently operating disposalsites at Barnwell, South Carolina; Richland, Washington; and Beatty, Nevada,during the interim access period, of January 1, 1986, through December31, 1992. In addition to these regular allocations, section 5 of the Actauthorizes DOE to grant to reactors, upon petition to DOE, additional allocationsof disposal capacity for low-level waste which may result from ``unusual''or ``unexpected'' operating and maintenance activities (``Unusual Volumeallocations''). Section 5 provides that the total disposal capacity allocated by DOE underthe Unusual Volumes procedure cannot exceed 800,000 cubic feet, or resultin total allocations of disposal capacity to commercial nuclear power reactorsin excess of 11,900,000 cubic feet. On January 26, 1987, DOE published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a Notice of Inquiry soliciting public commenton issues that it considered central to its management of the Unusual Volumesprocedure (52 FR 2792). These issues included the definition of ``unusualor unexpected'' activities; the availability of the 800,000 cubic feetcapacity (depending on the rate that full-power operating licenses aregranted); the petition process; informational requirements; and decisioncriteria for evaluating petitions. DOE expressed its intent to provideguidance for submitting, and criteria for evaluating petitions, upon considerationof the comments. Today, DOE responds to the comments received on the Noticeof Inquiry and proposes rules for the petition process. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Analysis of Comments and Proposed Rules </ITAG>Thirteen sources provided comments on the Notice of Inquiry. There wasan overriding concern expressed by the commenters that a process shouldbe implemented for equitably managing the Unusual Volumes procedure. Thecomments received and DOE's response to these comments are discussed below.A. Definition of ``Unusual'' and ``Unexpected'' Activities Section 5(c)(5) of the Act authorizes the Secretary to grant supplementalallocations of disposal capacity to commercial nuclear power reactors ifsuch capacity is necessary to permit unusual or unexpected operating, maintenance,repair or safety activities. The Notice of Inquiry proposed a list of ``unusualor unexpected'' low-level waste generating activities and invited suggestionsfor other appropriate activities. Commenters supported the proposed listof activities, but cautioned that any such list should be illustrative,and not exclude other unforeseen activities. DOE recognizes that other unforeseen operational or maintenance activitiescould be required over the 7-year interim access period. The definitionof unusual or unexpected activities in andSection; 730.2 is intended, therefore,as non-exclusive guidance to petitioners as to the type of low-level wastegenerating activities eligible for Unusual Volume allocations. As such,the list of examples is illustrative rather than prescriptive, and DOEwill consider other activities not typically associated with day-to-dayplant operations as eligible for allocations. However, DOE retains discretionregarding whether actually to grant an allocation for any such activity.B. Availability of the 800,000 Cubic Feet of Capacity The Act provides that DOE may not make Unusual Volume allocations thatwould result in total allocations to commercial power reactors in excessof 11,900,000 cubic feet. The 800,000 cubic feet of Unusual Volume disposalcapacity is available, subject to further reduction, within this overalllimitation. Congress derived the 800,000 cubic foot figure, in part, fromestimates of the dates that commercial nuclear power reactors, plannedor under construction, would receive their full-power operating licenses.The amount represents the difference between total estimated regular allocations,and the 11,900,000 cubic feet ceiling on all reactor low-level waste thatcan be disposed at the three operating disposal sites. DOE expressed concern in the Notice of Inquiry that the entire 800,000cubic feet may have to be scaled back if new reactors are licensed aheadof the projections used by the congressional committees in developing theallocation provision. However, commenters pointed out that licensing datesfor new reactors will often be delayed, most likely ensuring that the entire800,000 cubic feet will be available over the interim access period fordistribution as Unusual Volume allocations. DOE will proceed on this basis,and has incorporated this assumption at andSection; 730.8, <T3>Schedule for Distributing Allocations</T3>, of the proposed regulation.However, DOE will continue to monitor the licensing dates of new reactorsin order to assess the impact on the continued availability of disposalcapacity for Unusual Volume allocations, and to determine whether the amountshould be reduced to reflect any projected shortfalls. C. Petition Process Since the Act does not prescribe procedures for administering the UnusualVolumes provision, the Notice of Inquiry contained five options for managingallocations over the interim access period. In assessing these options,and the comments thereon, DOE's objective was to fashion a method of allocationthat would balance the need for equitable distribution during any one year,with the equally important necessity of preventing the premature depletionof the available disposal capacity prior to expiration of the interim accessperiod. <T3>Option 1, Petition as Needed</T3>: DOE would evaluate petitions asthey were received on a case-by-case basis, until the 800,000 cubic feetof capacity was depleted. <T3>Option 2, Annual Petitions</T3>: DOE would establish an annual deadlinefor submitting petitions for the upcoming year, and would simultaneouslyissue all allocations each year. <T3>Option 3, One Time Petition</T3>: DOE would establish a deadline forsubmitting petitions covering the entire interim access period, and wouldissue allocations for each eligible petition on a one-time basis. <T3>Option 4, Allocation Schedule</T3>: DOE would provide a disbursementschedule for allocating disposal capacity evenly over the interim accessperiod. <T3>Option 5, Combination of Options</T3>: DOE would select elements fromthe foregoing options. The majority of commenters supported the establishment of a schedule fordisbursement of allocations over the entire interim access period, as proposedunder Option 4. Some comments supported Option 1, allowing petitions tobe submitted as needed, but noted that this approach should nonethelesspromote equity among petitioners by ensuring access to disposal capacitythroughout the interim access period. In view of the convergence of concernsaround the long-term availability of Unusual Volume allocations, DOE proposesto combine Options 1 and 4. Accordingly, the proposed rule at andSection;730.4(b) permits petitions to be submitted as needed, but andSection; 730.8requires DOE to disburse available disposal capacity evenly over the interimaccess period, and to proportionately limit, if necessary in any particularyear, the volumes awarded in response to petitions. To ensure the availability of capacity over the interim access period,DOE proposes to divide the 800,000 cubic feet equally among the 7 yearsof the interim access period. The resulting 114,286 cubic feet is the ``yearlybase volume'' for Unusual Volumes allocations. Any capacity not allocatedduring a year will be applied in equal portions to each subsequent year.Since no allocations were granted in 1986, the 114,286 cubic feet availablein 1986 would be distributed equally among the remaining 6 years of theinterim access period, resulting in a new yearly base volume of 133,333cubic feet for the years 1987 through 1992. The proposed rules provide that DOE will not allocate more than the yearlybase volume in any year, unless it determines that (1) the cumulative capacityto be allocated does not significantly exceed the yearly base volume, anda significant number of petitions would be affected by limiting the allocations,or (2) it is substantially likely that the Unusual Volume capacity availablefor the remainder of the interim access period will exceed the volume forwhich petitions may be submitted. The proposed rules contain a mechanism for reconciling the limitation ontotal capacity issued each year with the flexibility granted to petitionersto file petitions as needed. The rules would permit DOE to (1) limit thecapacity issued in response to any petition (or multiple petitions in asingle year from the same petitioner) to 25 percent of the yearly basevolume applicable on the date of the petition, and (2) reduce the capacityavailable for allocation if the total capacity that may be issued for thatyear may exceed the yearly base volume. Under the latter provision, DOEassumes that as the year advances, petitions submitted respecting activitiesoccurring in that year may face an increasing likelihood of capacity reductions.This is because, as petitions are granted, DOE will have a firmer basisupon which to determine whether the yearly base volume for that year maybe exceeded. Correspondingly, however, it is likely that a petition submittedlater in a calendar year will request disposal capacity for an activityscheduled for the next calendar year; any Unusual Volume allocation inresponse to such a petition is less likely to be reduced, since it willbe made against the yearly base volume available for that year's activities.Under the proposed rules, DOE will not issue an allocation prior to 6 monthsbefore the start of the activity for which it is sought, which should also,promote a relatively even distribution over the interim access period.Moreover, in the event that the capacity allocated in response to a petitionis reduced under either of the provisions above, or the volume of wastegenerated by the activity otherwise exceeds the volume allocated, a petitionrequesting an additional allocation may be submitted in a subsequent year.Option 2 in the Notice of Inquiry would have obviated the need for capacityreductions on a case-by-case basis toward the end of the year. However,to reach this result, all petitions for an upcoming calendar year wouldhave been required to be submitted well in advance of that year, allowingDOE to reduce each allocation proportionally if the capacity availablefor disbursement was not sufficient to satisfy each request in full. However,the commenters felt that this method would have required the petitionsto be submitted too far in advance to allow petitioners to properly estimatethe allocation that would have been needed to permit activity. Commentersalso pointed out that, unlike most ``unusual'' activities, ``unexpected''activities, by definition, cannot be anticipated in this manner. A procedure using an annual deadline for submission of petitions wouldalso require that some portion of the volume be set aside for unexpectedactivities that could not have been foreseen, and a set of rules for distinguishingbetween unusual and unexpected activities. Absent statutory direction,DOE believes that such a procedure would be cumbersome to administer, andthat any potential benefit to petitioners would be outweighed by the inconvenience.Because of this, and because DOE believes that, notwithstanding yearlyfluctuations in the capacity awarded, the available capacity will be sufficientto accommodate petitions throughout the interim access period, DOE decidednot to propose a process requiring an annual deadline. For the same reasons,DOE also rejected Option 3, requiring a one-time petition from each reactorfor the entire interim access period. In considering the proposed rules and the comments received on the Noticeof Inquiry, it has become apparent to DOE that estimates of the volumeof waste that will result from an unusual or unexpected activity may notmatch the volume ultimately generated. In the interest of equitable distributionof available capacity, DOE encourages conservative estimates of the volumeof waste to be produced. (As noted, DOE will at any time accept petitionsfor additional capacity with respect to an activity for which an UnusualVolume allocation has already been granted). In this regard, the rulesalso provide that Unusual Volume capacity is granted conditionally uponuse of the volume allocated for the activity stated in the petition. Aftercompletion of the activity and disposal of the resulting waste, it is thepetitioner's responsibility promptly to report to DOE the volume of wastefrom the activity actually disposed. Any Unusual Volume capacity that hasbeen awarded in excess of the volume of waste disposed will revert to DOEfor redistribution. D. Petition Information The Notice of Inquiry proposed certain mandatory information requirementsto be included in each petition, and also proposed certain ``discretionary''elements in addition to the minimum requirements. The mandatory requirementsproposed in the Notice of Inquiry were: (a) Name, address, and telephonenumber of the petitioner and point of contact; (b) name of reactor andutility; (c) description of the waste; (d) explanation of the need foran allocation; (e) description of the activity generating the waste; and(f) certification that the waste does not constitute a health or safetyhazard and that the utility has not petitioned the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) for Emergency Access under section 6 of the Act. The proposed ruleat andSection; 730.5, <T3>Contents of Petitions, </T3>further elaborates the mandatory informationalrequirements in order to provide the level of detail necessary to makea proper evaluation of petitions. DOE will use the information to (1) identifythe petitioner, (2) determine if and when the petitioner may be eligiblefor an Unusual Volumes allocation, and (3) determine the volume to be issued.With the exceptions of item (d), explanation of need for the allocation,and item (f), ``health and safety'' certification, the commenters generallyconcurred in the mandatory informational requirements in the Notice ofInquiry. A number of commenters requested that DOE demonstrate a legal basis for,and clarify, item (d), explanation of the need for the allocation. Section5(c)(5)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to state in writing his reasonsfor ``so finding that making additional capacity available for such reactorthrough this paragraph is <T3>required </T3>to permit'' the unusual or unexpected activity (emphasisadded). The Act, then, suggests that an Unusual Volume allocation is notan entitlement comparable to the regular allocation that is granted asof right under section 5(c)(1). Instead, an Unusual Volume allocation isgranted only upon demonstration of a need for additional capacity in orderto permit activities that do not occur on a day-to-day basis. One commenter suggested that a showing of need might discriminate in favorof reactors that had not made conservative use of their regular allocations,and against reactors that had implemented aggressive volume reduction programs.While recognizing this concern, DOE decided to retain the showing of needbecause (1) it is required by the Act, and (2) the high cost of disposalitself provides incentive for reactors to reduce waste volumes in spiteof the availability of Unusual Volume allocations through the Unusual Volumesprovision. DOE believes that Unusual Volume allocations should not be consideredautomatic, and will evaluate each petition based on its demonstration ofneed. The mandatory information requirement, ``Need for Allocation,'' has beenfurther elaborated in the proposed rule to provide additional guidanceto petitioners. Each category of information under this item now correspondsto a category of the decision criteria for determining eligibility andmaking volume determinations. The commenters also requested clarification of item (f), which requiredthat petitioners certify that the waste ``does <T3>not </T3>constitute a health or safety hazard and that the utilityhas not petitioned the NRC for Emergency Access'' (emphasis added). Asproposed in the Notice of Inquiry, the ``health and safety'' certificationwas intended to be a corollary of the provision in section 6 (c)(1) ofthe Act that requires the NRC to determine that waste for which it grantsemergency access does pose ``an immediate and serious threat to the publichealth and safety.'' In contrast to the Emergency Access provision, which provides a last resortfor access to disposal facilities only if the waste poses a serious eminentdanger, the risk posed by waste for which Unusual Volume petitions aresubmitted may vary widely, if the waste remains undisposed. One of thepurposes of the Unusual Volumes procedure is to ensure that whatever potentialrisk the waste may pose is eliminated through properly regulated disposal.Therefore, upon further consideration, DOE has deleted the requirementthat petitioners certify that the waste does not constitute a health andsafety hazard. The proposed rule retains the requirement that petitioners state that theyhave not also requested Emergency Access for the waste through the NRC.DOE believes that this procedure does not conflict with the NRC's proposedrules for Emergency Access (52 FR 47587), which require petitioners todemonstrate that waste for which emergency access is requested would nototherwise qualify for Unusual Volume capacity. DOE also believes that thismodest requirement will serve to draw a distinction between these two provisionsof the Act. Requirement (c), ``description of the waste,'' has been changed to requirethat petitions verify that waste for which the petition is submitted issuitable for disposal in at least one of the three currently operatingdisposal facilities. DOE will not distinguish between different types ofwaste eligible for Unusual Volume allocations as long as the waste is suitablefor disposal in a currently operating site. The proposed rule also contains two mandatory informational requirementsnot originally included in the Notice of Inquiry. The proposed rule wouldrequire petitions to include (1) the dates over which the activity occurredor will occur, and (2) the dates over which the waste will be shipped fordisposal. This information will be necessary in order to determine whenan unusual volume allocation may be issued in response to a petition, inview of the requirement that no allocation may be issued prior to 6 monthsbefore the commencement of the activity. The discretionary information suggested in the Notice of Inquiry included:(a) Other utility management options; (b) impacts of denial of all or aportion of the request; (c) description of the utility's waste managementplan and volume reduction program; and (d) projected allocation requirementsduring the interim access period. Item (d) has been incorporated into theproposed rule for <T3>Contents of Petitions </T3>at andSection; 730.5(a)(6), which requirespetitioners to indicate their requirements for disposal capacity over theinterim access period. Comments concerning DOE's use of discretionary information were divided.Some commenters recommended that the information be required, while otherssuggested that it was not germaine. Under the proposed rule, DOE wouldrequire the petition to contain only the mandatory information specifiedin andSection; 730.5(a), <T3>Contents of Petitions</T3>. However, a petitioner could still includeany of the discretionary information elements proposed in the earlier Notice,or any other information that it believed might be useful to DOE in evaluatingthe petition. E. Decision Criteria The Notice of Inquiry proposed five decision criteria that would be usedto evaluate the eligibility of petitions for Unusual Volume allocationsand, for each eligible petition, to determine the volume to be allocated.The proposed rule more clearly distinguishes these two processes by dividingthem into separate sections, <T3>Eligibility Criteria</T3> (andSection; 730.6), and <T3>Volume Determination</T3> (andSection; 730.7), and including the applicabledecision criteria under each. The Notice of Inquiry proposed the following decision criteria: (a) Thenumber of applications, (b) activity which generated the waste, (c) consequencesof denial of the application, (d) other management options available tothe petitioner, and (e) waste volume reduction performed on the waste.A number of commenters suggested that item (a), the number of applications,was less important in determining the volume to be allocated than the sumof the volumes requested in the petitions. As described in the discussionunder subsection C of this Notice, the proposed rule, at andSection; 730.7(b),would require DOE to limit the capacity allocated if the total exceedsthe volume available for disbursement in that year. Item (b), activity which generated the waste, is included in the criteriafor determining eligibility of petitions at andSection; 730.6(a). DOE willconsider whether the waste is the result of an unusual or unexpected operating,maintenance, repair or safety activity as defined in the proposed rule.In response to comments, the decision criteria (c), consequences of denialof the application, and (d), other management options available to thepetitioner, are not included in the proposed rule as evaluation criteria.Upon further consideration, DOE determined that both of these draft criteriawere too speculative or subjective to provide a useful basis for evaluation.Instead, the proposed <T3>Eligibility Criteria</T3> at andSection; 730.6(b), and criteria for <T3>Volume Determination</T3> at andSection; 730.7 (a), prescribe a morequantitative evaluation of the information required under <T3>Contents of Petitions</T3> to demonstrate the need for the UnusualVolume allocation (andSection; 730.5(a)(6)). These decision criteria callfor a comparison of the capacity available from the petitioner's regularallocation, with the capacity requested in the petition. A petition wouldbe ineligible where the reactor's regular allocation is or will be sufficientto accommodate the additional waste from the unusual or unexpected activity.Where the regular allocation provides partial relief, the petition wouldbe eligible for an Unusual Volume allocation, but only to the extent thatthe capacity needed for the unusual activity cannot be offset by the petitioner'sregular allocation. Item (e) in the Notice of Inquiry, ``waste volume reduction performed onthe waste,'' is not included in the criteria for Volume Determination inthe proposed rule. Because of increasing costs of disposal and the accessibilityof volume reduction technology, DOE considers that the waste will mostlikely undergo volume reduction to the extent practicable. As discussed earlier in this Notice, the proposed rule for Volume Determinationat andSection; 730.7(b), (c) and (d) also includes criteria requiring DOEto reduce allocations for which a petition is otherwise eligible if (1)the disposal capacity requested exceeds or may exceed the capacity availablefor distribution; (2) the capacity requested exceeds 25 percent of thecapacity available for distribution; or (3) licensing of new reactors earlierthan expected may result in the sum of regular allocations and UnusualVolumes allocation exceeding 11,900,000 cubic feet. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Procedural Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 11291 Under Executive Order 12291 agencies are required to determine whetherproposed rules are major rules as defined in the Order. DOE has reviewedthis proposed rule and has determined that it is not a major rule because:Issuing Unusual Volume allocations, as proposed in this rule will not havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; will not resultin a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwill not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>, DOE finds that sections 603 and 604 of the said Act donot apply to this rule because, if promulgated, the rule will affect onlyelectrical utilities that own nuclear power reactors, and will not affectsmall entities. C. National Environmental Policy Act Issuing Unusual Volume allocations under this proposed rule will not resultin any effect on the quality of the human environment because (1) the totalcapacity for disposal of low-level waste from commercial power reactorsis limited to 11,900,000 cubic feet, irrespective of Unusual Volume allocations;(2) each disposal facility may limit the volume of waste disposed, regardlessof the availability of reactor allocations; and (3) the types of wastefor which Unusual Volume allocations are granted must be suitable for disposalat one of the currently operating disposal facilities. Therefore, DOE hasconcluded that the rulemaking is not a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, preparationof neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statementis required. However, petitions that meet eligibility requirements willbe subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act. D. Paperwork Reduction Act The Department of Energy has submitted the information collection listedat the end of this section to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for approval under provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.35). Comments pertaining to the Paperwork Reduction Act aspects of this proposedinformation collection must be filed within 30 days of publication of thisNotice. Address Paperwork Reduction Act comments to: Mr. Vartkes Broussalian,Department of Energy Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, 726Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20503 (202-395-3084).

Written notification will be provided to the petitioneracknowledging receipt of the petition. (b) Petitions may be filed as needed, i.e., before, during or after theactivity for which the request is made. (c) No Unusual Volume allocation will be made earlier than 6 months beforethe start of the unusual or unexpected activity for which an allocationis requested. (d) A petition may be submitted for additional capacity for disposal ofwaste resulting from an unusual or unexpected activity for which an UnusualVolume allocation has already been made. (e) Petitions are granted conditionally upon use of the volume allocatedfor the activity stated in the grant. Within 30 days after all waste resultingfrom such activity has been disposed, the recipient of an Unusual Volumeallocation shall report to the Department the volume of waste resultingfrom the activity that has been disposed. The excess of any Unusual Volumecapacity allocated for the activity will thereupon revert to DOE. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 730.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Contents of petitions. </ITAG>(a) Each petition for an Unusual Volume allocation shall contain the followinginformation: (1) Name, address and telephone number of point of contact; (2) Name of the reactor and utility requesting an allocation; (3) Detailed description of the activity generating the waste; (4) Dates during which the activity occurred or will occur; (5) Estimated dates (months and years) during which the waste will be shippedfor disposal; (6) Explanation of the need for the Unusual Volume allocation. This explanationshall include: (i) The reactor's regular allocation for the period in which the unusualor unexpected activity occurred or will occur; (ii) The volume of waste generated or estimated to be generated by theunusual or unexpected activity; (iii) Explanation of the extent to which the reactor's regular allocationfor the period in which the unusual or unexpected activity occurred orwill occur can accommodate the waste generated by the unusual or unexpectedactivity; (iv) The volume of disposal capacity requested, expressed in cubic feet.(7) Statement that the petitioner has not applied to the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission for emergency access under section 6 of the Act; (8) Statement that the waste for which the petition is submitted is suitablefor disposal at at least one of the operating disposal sites identifiedin the Act. (9) Any other information the petitioner believes will assist in evaluatingthe petition. (b) After the petition has been submitted, the Department may seek additionalinformation from the petitioner in order to enable the Department to determineeligibility for an allocation, or to determine the capacity to be allocated.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 730.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Eligibility criteria. </ITAG>The Department will use the following criteria to determine whether a petitionis eligible for an allocation. (a) The activity for which the petition is submitted should be an unusualor unexpected activity, as defined in andSection; 730.2. (b) The petition should demonstrate that the balance of a reactor's regularallocation at the time the unusual or unexpected activity occurred or willoccur, plus the balance of any Unusual Volume allocation the reactor hasreceived, will not exceed the sum of the volume that will be needed forregular activities during the transition period or the licensing period,as applicable, and the volume that is needed during the period for theunusual or unexpected activity. (c) The waste resulting from the activity for which the petition is submittedshould be suitable for disposal at at least one of the operating disposalsites identified in the Act. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 730.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Volume determination. </ITAG>(a) Except as adjusted under paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section,the allocation issued in response to a petition shall be the differencebetween the volume that the Department determines to be required to disposeof waste from the unusual or unexpected activity, and that portion of totalallocations received by the reactor (regular and Unusual Volume allocations)that will be available for application toward disposal of waste from theactivity. The allocation volume that will be available for disposal ofthis waste is the difference between the total allocation volume that thereactor has received, and the sum of: (1) The reactor's regular allocation volume already used for disposal ofwaste from regular activities; (2) The reactor's regular allocation volume that is expected to be requiredfor disposal of waste from regular activities through the remainder ofthe transition period or licensing period, as applicable; (3) Any portion of the reactor's regular allocation volume that will havebeen used at the time the Unusual Volume allocation is issued to disposeof waste from the activity for which the petition is submitted; and (4) Any portion of any previous Unusual Volume allocation that will havebeen used at the time the Unusual Volume allocation is issued to disposeof waste from the activity for which the petition is submitted. (b) Except as provided in andSection; 730.8, if the Department determinesthat the total Unusual Volume awarded for any year, as determined underparagraph (a) of this section, may exceed the yearly base volume for thatyear, as determined under andSection; 730.8, the Department shall reducepending and subsequent allocations for that year so that the sum of thevolumes awarded does not exceed the yearly base volume. (c) The capacity allocated to any single reactor shall not exceed 25 percentof the yearly base volume, as determined under andSection; 730.8, duringthe year for which the allocation is made. (d) If the Department determines that licensing of new reactors will resultin the sum of regular reactor allocations and Unusual Volume allocationsexceeding 11,900,000 cubic feet, then pending and subsequent allocationswill be reduced so that the sum of all allocations does not exceed 11,900,000cubic feet. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 730.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Schedule for distributing allocations </ITAG>(a) The yearly base volume that is available for disbursement by the Departmentduring a calendar year in response to Unusual Volume petitions shall bedetermined as follows: The 800,000 cubic feet of capacity available shallbe divided equally among the 7 years. Any capacity not allocated in a yearshall be distributed in equal portions among subsequent years. (b) Any excess disposal capacity conveyed to the Department under andSection;730.4(e) shall be distributed in equal portions to the yearly base volumesfor subsequent years. (c) The Department shall not allocate more than the yearly base volumein any year, unless it determines that: (1)(i) The volume capacity to be issued does not significantly exceed theyearly base volume, and (ii) A significant number of petitions would be affected by so limitingallocations; or (2) It is substantially likely that the Unusual Volume capacity availablefor the remainder of the interim access period will exceed the capacityfor which petitions will be submitted. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-757 Filed 1-19-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-D </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
