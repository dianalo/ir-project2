This support is reflectedin the Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Research, Developmentand Demonstration Program, which began in 1977 with research projectsfocusing on solar and wind energy. Since then, research, developmentand demonstation projects have been supported on such topics as geothermalenergy, fusion energy, energy conservation in buildings, waste heat recoveryand general energy conservation. Beginning in 1983/84, the program'semphasis shifted to three subjects, each of which became a separate subprogramarea. These subprograms are in the areas of energy conservation in buildings,wind energy, and waste heat recovery/low temperature heat utilization.This report reviews the projects undertaken in these three subprograms.In addition, a technology transfer and dissemination project, which beganduring the last quarter of 1985/86, was responsible for raising the profileof the program and led to some suggestions for future projects.</TEXT></DOC>
