Theseselfless individuals have a profound influence upon the life of their communitiesand the character of our Nation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The abundance of voluntarism and charitable giving across the UnitedStates today is not surprising_throughout our Nation's history, Americanshave readily responded to the needs of others. The early American settlersrelied on each other's help to break ground and build homes in the NewWorld. Volunteers eventually won our country's Independence. The men wholater wrote its Constitution set aside their farms and personal interestsfor a long hot summer in order to shape a government for the new Nation.Their work and the risks they took were not for personal profit, but werefor the benefit of all Americans. Men of faith and vision, the Nation'sFounding Fathers recognized their responsibilities toward others and towardposterity. Many delegates to the Constitutional Convention solemnly notedthat their efforts would determine the fate of future generations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The system of government the Founding Fathers framed so carefullyhas enabled voluntarism to thrive in the United States. For example, freedomof speech allows us to express openly our political and social concerns;freedom of assembly allows us to join together in efforts to improve ourcommunities. In short, our constitution ensures that the light of individualgoodness is not extinguished by the heavy hand of government, but is insteadkindled by the bright flame of liberty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Our forefathers' sacrifices have helped the United States to becomea great and prosperous nation. For the sake of generations to come, ourown generation must likewise accept the obligation to serve others. Fromnow on in America, any definition of a successful life must include serviceto one's neighbor. It is only by continuing this proud tradition of servicethat we ensure our Nation's success.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As we look around us today, we see signs of truly successful lives.We see neighbor helping neighbor, Americans serving Americans. Today, nearlyhalf of all adult Americans are active as volunteers. We know them well:the grandmother at church or temple who cares for infants so their parentscan attend services, the cook at the local soup kitchen, the tutor whohelps the illiterate learn to read, the teen who visits nursing homes,the neighbor who campaigns door-to-door for his favorite candidate, andthe family that opens its home to unwed mothers or foster children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">I salute these individuals and the numerous organizations across thecountry that help to coordinate their activities. My Administration iscommitted to promoting their efforts and encouraging others to join them_thatis why I have established an Office of National Service at the White House,and that is why I personally urge every American to follow their fine example.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution andlaws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of April 9 throughApril 15, 1989, as National Volunteer Week. I ask all Americans to joinin saluting and thanking our Nation's volunteers, as well as the organizationsthat support their efforts.
