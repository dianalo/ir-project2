<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0569 </DOCNO><TEXT>A case of double aortic arch in the newborn (age: 1 month) explored withmagnetic resonance imaging is reported. MRI offers a non invasive andnon ionizing examination very well-tolerated by the patient if a correctmethodology is used (total acquisition time 40 mn). The quality of theimages is sufficient for diagnosis and presurgical evaluation: the diameter,the permeability and the relationship with the surrounding organs ofthe respective aortic arches were well demonstrated with this technique.The contributions of MRI with respect to 2-D echocardiography and angiographyas well as the future possible totally non invasive evaluation of thiscardiac anomaly is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
