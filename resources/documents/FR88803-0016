In response to the requirements of the Clean Air Act,and the commitment made in its 1982 Part D Ozone SIP to adopt RACT regulationsfor applicable VOC source categories, the Pennsylvania Department of EnvironmentalResources submitted a revision to the Philadelphia portion of the PennsylvaniaOzone SIP on February 23, 1987, which incorporated the recommendationsmade in this CTG document. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also submittedpharmaceutical tablet coating regulations which will be acted upon undera separate rulemaking action. In addition, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvaniasubmitted a revised definition pertaining to VOC, as well as complianceguidelines for VOC. EPA is not acting on this portion of the request atthis time, because Philadelphia's revised definition of VOC is inconsistentwith EPA's currently recommended definition. EPA will act on this portionof the request at a later date.This revision would amend Philadelphia's Air Management Regulation V byadding new definitions pertaining to petroleum solvents and petroleum solventdry cleaning, and adding a new Section XI entitled ``Petroleum SolventDry Cleaning.'' Compliance guidelines for implementing this Section werealso submitted.Philadelphia provided adequate notice in a local newspaper informing thepublic of a hearing on December 10, 1985, pertaining to the proposed amendmentto Air Management Regulation V. Comments from the public hearing were takeninto consideration prior to adopting final regulations. This proposed revisionis discussed in more detail below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section I. Definitions</ITAG><T3>Petroleum Solvents_</T3>Organic material solvents produced by petroleumdistillation, comprising a hydrocarbon range of mainly 8 to 12 carbon atomsper organic molecule, that are used as cleaning agents in the petroleumsolvent dry cleaning industry.<T3>Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning</T3>_A process for the cleaning of fabricswith a petroleum solvent by means of one or more washings in solvent, extractionof excess solvent, and drying by exposure to a heated air stream. A petroleumsolvent dry cleaning facility includes, but is not limited to, washers,dryers, solvent filters and purification systems, waste disposal systems,holding tanks, pumps, and attendant piping valves.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section XI. Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning</ITAG>This section applies to petroleum solvent dry cleaning facilities, as definedin section I, that consume more than one hundred (100) gallons of petroleumsolvent on a daily basis.This regulation specifies that the owner or operator of any petroleum solventdry cleaning dryer subject to this section shall limit VOC emissions tothe atmosphere to an average of 3.5 pounds of VOC per one hundred (100)pounds dry weight of articles dry cleaned; or shall install and operatea solvent recovery dryer in a manner such that the dryer remains closedand the recovery phase continues until a final recovered solvent flow rateof fifty (50) milliliters per minute is attained.Another provision of this regulation specifies that any petroleum solventfiltration system subject to this section shall reduce the VOC contentin all filtration wastes to one (1) pound or less per one hundred (100)pounds dry weight of articles dry cleaned, before disposal and exposureto the atmosphere; or shall install and operate a cartridge filtrationsystem, and drain the filter cartridges in their sealed housings for eight(8) hours or more before their removal.Furthermore, this regulation requires that the owner or operator of anypetroleum solvent dry cleaning facility subject to this section shall repairall petroleum solvent vapor and liquid leaks within three (3) working daysafter identifying the sources of the leaks. Also, if the necessary repairparts are not on hand, the owner or operator shall order these parts withinthree (3) working days, and repair the leaks no later than three (3) workingdays following the arrival of the necessary parts.Additionally, this regulation specifies that the owner or operator of anypetroleum solvent dry cleaning facility subject to this section shall install,operate and maintain equipment consistent with manufacturer's specificationsand recommendation in order to minimize VOC emissions. Also, the owneror operator shall minimize fugitive VOC emissions from the storage, handlingand transfer of petroleum solvent or petroleum solvent containing materialsthrough employment of appropriate operating practices or procedures toreduce solvent loss and evaporation to the atmosphere.Lastly, the CTG requires that the implementing agency establish or approveprocedures, methods and guidelines for petroleum solvent dry cleaning facilitiesto determine compliance with the requirements of this section and the owneror operator of any affected facility shall comply with such procedures,methods and guidelines, including requirements for inspection, testing,recordkeeping and reporting, as prescribed by the agency and consistentwith current U.S. EPA guidance. The compliance guidelines for control ofemissions from petroleum solvent dry cleaning have been submitted as partof the SIP revision, and are discussed in more detail in the technicalsupport document (TSD) accompanying this proposed rulemaking action.It should be noted that the compliance guidelines currently do not containspecific recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The Philadelphia AirManagement Services (AMS) has drafted reporting and recordkeeping requirementsto be incorporated into these guidelines. These proposed requirements readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Recordkeeping and Reporting</ITAG>The owner or operator of any affected petroleum solvent dry cleaning facilityshall maintain records of operations, inspections, and maintenance suchthat the PADER can determine compliance. These records shall at a minimum,include:1. Information on purchases, inventory, and daily consumption of petroleumsolvents.2. Operational information on washers, dryers and solvent filtration systems,including daily hours of operation, cycle times, and dry weight of articlescleaned.3. Information on leak inspections and repairs for all equipment and componentshandling petroleum solvents.Each required record or item of information shall be retained at the facilityfor a period of two (2) years, and shall be made available to the Departmentfor inspection or copying upon request.A. The owner or operator shall also maintain and make available for inspectionby the Department copies of all manufacturers' specifications and recommendationsfor dry cleaning equipment operated at the facility.B. The Department may require the owner or operator of any affected facilityto submit reports summarizing information on daily operations, inspectionsand maintenance activities, or such other information as required by theDepartment to determine compliance. The Department shall notify the owneror operator in writing of such reporting requirements and shall prescribethe form and manner in which such reports are to be submitted.An addendum to the TSD has been prepared which outlines this proposed amendmentto the compliance guideline, as well as outlining other minor revisionpertaining to recordkeeping and reporting. The amendments regarding recordkeepingand reporting will be formally incorporated into the compliance guidelinesprior to taking final rulemaking action on this request.EPA is proposing approval of this revision based on a determination thatit conforms with the CTG pertaining to large petroleum dry cleaners (EPA450/3-82-009), as well as fulfilling the requirements of the Clean AirAct which mandates the adoption of such a regulation. Also, in accordancewith this mandate, this action fulfills a requirement contained in the1982 Part D Ozone SIP for Pennsylvania and Philadelphia which specifiesthat RACT regulations for applicable VOC source categories, for which guidelinesare released, must be adopted, implemented and enforced by the state.In addition to the above, EPA is proposing approval based on a determinationthat the amendment meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2) of the CleanAir Act and 40 CFR Part 51, Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, andSubmittal of State Implementation Plans.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: November 4, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stanley L.
