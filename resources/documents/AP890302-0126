More than 110 countries have accepted Britain's invitation toattend the three-day conference ``Saving the Ozone Layer,'' saidEnvironment Secretary Nicholas Ridley.   Scientists say compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,are destroying the layer of ozone that shields the planet from thesun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   They also trap heat and reflect it back to Earth, which graduallywarms the planet's surface and changes global weather patterns in aphenomenon known as the ``Greenhouse Effect.''   ``If you could stop the use of CFCs, you stop two major evils,''Ridley said this week.   The compounds, invented in 1930, are widely used in refrigeratorcoolants, foam insulation, fast-food packaging, solvents andpropellants for aerosol spray cans.   Thirty-one countries have agreed to reduce chlorofluorocarbonemissions by 50 percent by the end of the century.   On Thursday, ministers of the European Economic Community decidedto empower the 12-nation bloc to seek a complete ban by 1999.   Britain has already vowed to halve its emissions by the end ofthis year and to reduce total emissions by 85 percent by 1999.   Several countries, including the United States, have banned theuse of the compounds in aerosol propellants, and Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher said Thursday that Britain will soon require allnew refrigerators to contain substances that would not harm theozone layer.   Britain will lobby other nations to follow suit, Ridley said.Emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as India andChina, which are gearing up for mass production of refrigerators andother consumer goods containing the compounds, he said.   The conference, to be opened by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi,will hear first from scientists studying ozone depletion, then fromindustrialists developing safe alternatives for some compounds.   ``The big race now is on in industry, because the first industrythat can produce CFC-free products has the world as its oyster,''said Lord Caithness, a junior environment minister.   Government officials and ministers will conclude the conferenceby discussing proposals to reduce the compounds, Ridley said. Mrs.Thatcher, an Oxford University-educated chemist, will address theconference, and William Reilly, designated head of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, will represent the United States.   The compounds and related chemicals known as halons, which areused in firefighting equipment, can last more than 100 years. Theyare stable and non-toxic at lower levels, but when they reach thestratosphere, 15-25 miles up, they are broken up by ultravioletradiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone.   Over the Antarctic, an ozone hole _ an area where ozone has beenseriously depleted _ is worsening, according to the Britishgovernment's Stratospheric Ozone Review Group. The group reportedthat ozone concentration was reduced by more than 95 percent in someparts.   An international expedition warned in February that theatmosphere over the Arctic region is also primed for a largedestruction of ozone.   The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration reportedlast year that annual ozone depletion over the Northern Hemisphere'smid-latitudes is also much higher than thought. The protectiveshield appears to have shrunk by about 2.3 percent since 1969 overthe area, which includes most of the United States and Canada, NASAsaid.   Scientists have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layerwould increase the numbers of skin cancers. According to theGreenpeace environmental group, each 1 percent depletion isestimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4percent.   Ridley said the London conference will end without a formalagreement or signed declaration, but ``we want them to accept thepolitical urgency of cooperating worldwide.   ``We are trying to get everybody to sign up to the concept thatwe should get rid of them as soon as possible.''</TEXT></DOC>
