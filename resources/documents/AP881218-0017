DALE NELSON</BYLINE><HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan said the voters gave GeorgeBush a mandate to continue the Reagan administration policies, butBush appears likely to change course on some key issues, bothcritics and supporters say.   ``I think, fiscally, circumstances will dictate that he has nochoice but to be, if anything, a little more conservative thanReagan; in other areas he could be substantially more moderate,''says Iowa's Republican Rep. Jim Leach, who supported Bush for theGOP presidential nomination.   ``It is obvious that he will not permit Central America orNicaragua to become the centerpiece of his foreign policy as Reagandid,'' says Lawrence Birns, director of the Council on HemisphericAffairs, a organization often critical of the administration.   ``You are not going to hear from him the same kind of fiercerhetoric about limited government that you have heard the last eightyears,'' says M.E. Bradford, a professor of English at theUniversity of Dallas and a writer on Southern conservatism. ``Thesharp edge is going to be off a lot of things.''   There are other hints that winds of change may be blowing despitethe much-heralded continuity of the vice president's succession tothe presidency by election for the first time in 150 years.   As his national security adviser, Bush has chosen BrentScowcroft, whose views have often differed from those of the Reaganadministration. Scowcroft supported the single-warhead mobileMidgetman when the Pentagon wanted to scrap the missile and deploythe 10-warhead MX on rail cars instead.   And in testimony last year, Scowcroft called the administration's``broad'' interpretation of the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty, atranslation designed to ease the way for tests of the Star Warsspace defense system, ``unbefitting.''   Black civil rights activist Jesse Jackson met with Bush Nov. 30and said he was able to discuss matters with him that he had neverbeen able to raise with Reagan. He said they talked aboutanti-semitism and racism among other subjects.   The same day, Bush met with environmental leaders, one of whom,Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said thedifference between the president and the president-elect was like``night and day'' although Bush made no specific commitments. Majorenvironmental groups opposed Bush during the campaign, but herepeatedly called himself an environmentalist, something Reaganseldom does.   In East-West relations, Reagan has consistently framed the basicconflict with the Soviets in moral terms. The president-elect speaksmore often in terms of great power competition. It was Reagan, notBush, who used to call the Soviet Union ``the evil empire.''   In the campaign, Bush, like Reagan, promised to pick judges whowould interpret the law, not make it. He departed from anythingReagan ever said, however, in also promising there would be noideological ``litmus test'' for judicial nominations.   With all of this, there are still more similarities thandifferences in their views, judging from their own statements andthose of others.   ``George Bush has gotten his mandate from the American people,the mandate to continue the policies that have brought peace andprosperity,'' Reagan said four days after the election.   Most insistently, Bush has restated the key pledge on whichReagan stood for eight years: No new taxes.   ``For the foreseeable future, I think the people who are lookingfor him to change his mind about that are very foolish,'' said theconservative scholar Bradford.   Leach, however, said that ``circumstances and compromises couldmean some movement'' on this issue although Bush will ``withoutdoubt ... be much more disinclined to look at the tax structure''than his Democratic critics.   Bradford and the Hemispheric Affairs Council's Birns agreed thatin dealing with the Sandinista government of Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega, Bush would seek a solution more acceptable toDemocrats in Congress than the all-out military aid for the Contrarebels that Reagan has favored.   ``I don't think the Contras will be abandoned,'' said Bradford.``But I think he will try very hard to bring a lot of Democrats withhim.''   ``I think his instincts are the same as Reagan's,'' the Texasprofessor added. ``He would like to blow Ortega out of the tub.''   ``We know that Bush is a cowboy on the subject of Nicaragua,''said Birns. ``But it just doesn't make sense that he is going tostrap himself to a policy that has failed.''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, a foe of Contra aid, saidafter a post-election meeting with Bush that he was ``encouraged tobelieve that there is a search for a policy that will beacceptable'' both to the president-elect and Congress.   On the Middle East, many experts contend that the Palestinianuprising and other developments make the time ripe for more activeAmerican diplomacy. Sol Linowitz, who was sent to the region as aspecial envoy by President Carter, has suggested that Bush promptlyname another such emissary.   Bush aides have said it is too early to make such a decision,since the new administration's Middle Eastern policy is still beingformulated.   Reagan last week authorized a ``substantive dialogue'' betweenthe United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Bushsaid he supported the decision.   ``I think Bush will be committed to the future of Israel,'' Leachsaid. ``He also, I think, recognizes it is unwise not to listen toall sides. I think you'll see someone in the White House whounderstands more of the subtleties of the Middle East than we've hadin recent years.''   Bush traveled to Israel, Egypt and Jordan in 1986 in a tripbilled at the time as a mission to spur the peace process.   On other issues, Leach said, ``I look for progressive armscontrol, I look for a much more effective and principled use ofinternational organizations like the United Nations. He set a littlemore moderate agenda in the environment, in education, in day care.''</TEXT></DOC>
