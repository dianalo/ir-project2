Sikorski on April 10, 1986, and reported out of the House Subcommitteeon Health and the Environment in amended form on May 20, 1986. The billnever reached a debate in full committee, however. The bill consistsof a two-phase program to limit utility sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2}) emissions.Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO/sub x/) and emissions from industrialboilers, industrial processes, and transportation sources would alsobe reduced. It is estimated that Phase I would reduce utility SO{sub2} emissions by 2.6 x 10{sup 6} tons/yr by 1993, relative to the base-caseforecast for that year. Phase II would reduce utility SO{sub 2} emissionsby 6.1 x 10{sup 6} tons/yr by 1997. The approximate costs are $0.7 x10{sup 9}/yr for Phase I and $2.2 x 10{sup 9}/yr for Phase II. Thesecost estimates are compared with similar estimates made by ICF Incorporatedfor the US Environmental Protection Agency. The Sikorski bill is estimatedto also achieve a reduction in utility NO/sub x/ emissions of about 1.3x 10{sup 6} tons/yr at a cost of $400 x 10{sup 6}/yr. In general, state-levelelectricity rates are not expected to increase by more than 6 to 8% whenpollution control costs are equally distributed (in terms of percentelectricity rate increases) among residential, commercial, and industrialusers. 38 refs., 8 figs., 33 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
