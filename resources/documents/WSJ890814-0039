The company said it agreed generally to a New Hampshire proposal that rate increases over the next seven years be limited to 5.5% annually. Future rates have been the critical factor in negotiations because they will determine the utility company's financial condition and thus how much creditors and shareholders receive in the reorganization.    A reorganization based on the state's rates could value the company at as much as $2.2 billion. PS of New Hampshire owes its creditors about $1.72 billion.    PS of New Hampshire would like to negotiate a plan under which it would emerge as an independent company. However, Judge James Yacos said that others also can propose reorganization plans, with the plan that provides the most value winning out. Northeast Utilities, based in Hartford, Conn., and New England Electric System, based in Westboro, Mass., both have offered to acquire PS of New Hampshire.    Judge Yacos set a deadline of Sept. 15 for filing reorganization plans. Richard Levin, an attorney for the utility, said the company, which filed for protection from creditors in January 1988, hopes to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by July 1, 1990.    PS of New Hampshire's common closed Friday at $4.25 a share, unchanged, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Its bellwether 17.5% debentures, due 2004, closed at $85 for each $100 principal amount, up $2.875.    In view of a history of squabbles between the state and the company, differences still could arise in negotiating an internal reorganization. &quot;It's not a done deal,&quot; said Larry Smukler, senior assistant attorney general for the state. &quot;Now we have three bidders, Northeast, NEES {New England Electric} and the company itself on a stand-alone basis.&quot; But a spokesman for the company said, &quot;We think that {an internal reorganization} is doable.&quot; The company said the &quot;principles of a distribution agreement&quot; have been discussed determining what creditors and shareholders would receive in an internal reorganization.    Creditors also were encouraged. &quot;We have broken a major logjam,&quot; said Daniel Frank, a fund manager at Fidelity Investments, a mutual fund company that is a major holder of PS of New Hamsphire unsecured debt and common.    Northeast, which recently improved to $1.9 billion its offer to buy the New Hampshire utility, is &quot;more than willing to compete with other parties,&quot; said Robert Busch, senior vice president, finance. New England Electric has said it plans to top Northeast's latest offer.    The state endorsed the Northeast bid after Northeast agreed to limit rate increases over the next seven years to 5.5% a year. The state and PS of New Hampshire in effect have agreed to discuss an internal reorganization involving the same rate increases. The company had been seeking slightly higher increases, but it says that differences in the rate-making assumptions used by the two parties mean the proposals are very similar.    PS of New Hampshire filed for bankruptcy-court protection because of the large debt related to its 35.7% stake in the long-delayed Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant. Proponents hope that the plant, which recently completed low-power testing, will finally get a commercial license and begin full-power operation early next year, although critics continue to oppose its start-up. </TEXT></DOC>
