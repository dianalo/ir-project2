Ms. Blair's time of 40.33 seconds was well off her 1988Olympic and world record of 39.10, but well ahead ofrunner-up Ye Qiaobo of China. Ms. Ye finished in 40:51.

LUGE                                                                                                          Georg Hackl of Germany, the 1988 silver medalist, won themen's singles luge with a time of 3:02.363 seconds for hisfour runs.   Mr. Hackl widened his first-day lead, leaving Markus Prockof Austria with the silver medal. Markus Schmidt, anotherAustrian, won the bronze.   Mr. Hackl, a 25-year-old soldier from Bavaria was 0.306second faster than Mr. Prock and 0.579 second faster than Mr.Schmidt.   Mr. Hackl, a two-time world champion, posted the fastesttimes in three heats, including both yesterday, when freshsnow slowed the course.   Duncan Kennedy was the top American finisher in 10thplace, about 1.5 seconds behind the leader. This is the onlyOlympic sport meausured to thousandths of a second.                                                                                                          CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING                                                                                                          Norwegians swept the three medals in the men's30-kilometer cross-country skiing, as Vegard Ulvang, 28, tookthe gold in a time of one hour, 22 minutes 27.8 seconds.   The Norwegians had previously been shut out in this event.Bjorn Dahlie and Terje Langli won the silver and bronze,respectively. The clean sweep of medals is the first in men'sNordic skiing since the sport joined the Winter Games programin 1948 at St. Moritz. The 30K race was added in 1956.                                                                                                          COMBINED DOWNHILL                                                                                                          Jan Einar Thorsen of Norway leads after the downhillportion of the men's combined event, but Paul Accola ofSwitzerland appears in position to win.   Mr. Accola, the World Cup overall leader and winner ofboth combined events on the tour this season, is among theworld's best in the slalom -- the race that completes thecombined competition today. Mr. Accola is 0.76 second off thelead, in fifth place.   Mr. Thorsen has never finished in the top 15 in the slalomon the World Cup circuit. Indeed, he says he hasn't trainedfor the slalom in six years. His downhill time was 1:44.97.   Gianfranco Martin of Italy, a good slalom skier, wassecond in the downhill portion in 1:45.48, followed byanother Italian, Franco Colturi, in 1:45.59. Xavier Gigandetof Switzerland was fourth in 1:45.61.   A.J. Kitt of the U.S. was 10th, while Californian KyleRasmussen was 11th -- both are probably too far back to winmedals.                                                                                                          HOCKEY                                                                                                          Czechoslovakia beat France 6-4, after the French team hadtaken a 2-0 first-period lead on the medal contenders.   The United Team thrashed Norway, 8-1, the former Sovietteam's second consecutive rout.   Canada beat Switzerland 6-1, as Eric Lindros scored twogoals and had an assist.   The three winners are tied for first place atop theirsix-team group.   MISSING NATION                                                                                                          Alberto Perez, where are you? The roll call at theOlympics dropped to 64 nations when Mr. Perez, Colombia'sonly registered athlete failed to appear for his event.   Clemencia Anaya, who is coordinating Colombia'sparticipation in the Summer Olympics, said she hasn't heardof Mr. Perez. &quot;If he registered, he did it extra-officially,&quot;she commented in Bogota.</TEXT></DOC>
