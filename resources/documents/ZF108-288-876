QPSX has pioneered this technology and was the firmthat tested the world's first operating MAN; the emerging internationalstandard for MAN equipment is based on QPSX's technology developments.andM;Bell of Pennsylvania's parent, Bell Atlantic, anticipates the launch of ageneral commercial SMDS service by the winter of 1991-92 to a number ofmarkets, including higher education, health care, research firms, andfederal, state and local governments.andP;  As part of this implementation effort,Bell Atlantic will be evaluating MAN technology from a variety of vendorsincluding equipment from ATandamp;T, also to be built to the emerging internationalMAN standard.andM;Information transfer speeds are said to be exceptionally fast using SMDS evenfor sonograms and other digitized images that require millions of bits ofdata to be transmitted and processed to generate a single image.andP;  It is feltthat this speed will have the effect that users of the service will almostnever get a &quot;busy&quot; signal when trying to send data and that the informationwill arrive seemingly in an instant.andM;(Barbara E.
