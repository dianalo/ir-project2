The energy concern said the sale represents about 19% of its proved oil and natural gas reserves or roughly 130 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent reserves.    Proceeds of $190 million, after adjustments, from these sales and a sale completed in late 1987 will be used to reduce debt, Transco said. </TEXT></DOC>
