Separately, OSHA proposed to lower the permissible levelfor formaldehyde used in apparel and furniture manufacture,foundry work and other industrial applications. The proposalwas made under a court order for the agency to consider morestringent standards for the toxic chemical.   OSHA proposed reducing the allowable maximum level to anaverage 0.75 parts for each million parts of air over eighthours, from the existing level of one ppm. It estimated thatthe regulations would provide additional protection for84,000 workers at an employer cost of $34.8 million a year.   OSHA also proposed to require that workers affected byformaldehyde be moved to other jobs; hazard-warning labels aslow as 0.1 ppm for materials that can give off formaldehydefumes; and training for employees exposed to formaldehydeconcentrations of one ppm or more. The proposals wererecommended by an industry group and four unions. OSHA willdecide on the proposals after a 30-day period for publiccomments.</TEXT></DOC>
