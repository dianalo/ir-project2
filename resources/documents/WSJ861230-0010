In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pacific and Trafalgar, a Los Angeles-based investment concern, said they intend to acquire additional common shares of U.S. Home and seek representation on its board. The two concerns also &quot;may seek to obtain control of (U.S. Home) through a tender offer, merger or other business combination,&quot; according to the filing.    Gene Coleman, national marketing director for Dallas-based Pacific, said the alliance was formed as a possible prelude to another bid for U.S. Home. He wouldn't comment, however, on whether the company had any specific plans to begin another bid. He also declined to discuss other possible actions by the two companies.    Houston-based U.S. Home is the nation's second-largest home builder.    Through its subsidiary, Pacific Realty/New York Corp., also based in Dallas, Pacific owns 9.2% of U.S. Home. As part of the agreement Trafalgar would buy another 9.2% of U.S. Home over the next year, Pacific said. Pacific said Trafalgar currently doesn't hold any U.S. Home stock.    Trafalgar officials wouldn't comment beyond the information in the filing. The closely held company is controlled by Charles W. Knapp, the former chairman of Financial Corp. of America, parent of American Savings andamp; Loan, one of the nation's largest thrifts.    A spokeswoman for U.S. Home declined to comment on the company's reaction to the alliance, but said, &quot;We haven't been contacted by (Pacific and Trafalgar). We will discuss what their intentions are if they so desire.&quot;    In July, Pacific, a real estate developer, made a cash-and-stock bid of $9.20 a share, or $332.8 million, for U.S. Home. The home builder rejected the proposal, calling it &quot;highly conditioned&quot; and saying there was &quot;no evidence&quot; that Pacific could arrange the financing.    &quot;It looks like Pacific Realty has regrouped and is going to take another run at U.S. Home,&quot; said Jeff Helton, an analyst with Lovett, Mitchell, Webb andamp; Garrison a Houston brokerage. He said two factors could make it easier for Pacific to mount another bid: the drop in the stock price since July and a second-quarter write-down of $80 million taken by U.S. Home for restructuring and cost cutting. Mr. Helton estimated that the write-down lowered the company's book value to about $5.35 a share.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, U.S. Home closed at $4.25 a share, off 12.5 cents.    Based on yesterday's closing price, the company has a market value of about $170 million. On the day Pacific's previous bid was announced, U.S. Home's stock closed at $7.75 a share.    Mr. Helton expressed surprise that the market yesterday didn't react strongly to the news of the alliance between Pacific and Trafalgar. He suggested that activity could have been slow because of the holiday season.    U.S. Home has been plagued by losses in the past two years. For the nine months, the company posted a net loss of $82.6 million, including a loss from discontinued operations of $19.4 million, on revenue of $563.1 million.    When Mr. Knapp formed Trafalgar early in 1985, he said he could raise &quot;well in excess&quot; of $1 billion to spend on investments such as venture capital financings and leveraged buyouts. Since then, the company has made some well-publicized bids that haven't panned out. In one instance last year, Trafalgar and London-based Glen International Finance Service Co. made a $1.43 billion bid for Minebea Co. of Japan. The attempt failed when Minebea was acquired by Kanemori Co., a Japanese company. </TEXT></DOC>
