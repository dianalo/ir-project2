Meanwhile, however,anti-terror laws have been refined, and a secret surveillance courthas been busy. If terrorists are looking for America'svulnerabilities, authorities say the reverse is increasingly true,too.</TEXT><NOTE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>RIDGEFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Traffic droned on the New Jersey Turnpikejust as on any other Tuesday morning. Commuters passed through therest area here just as sleepy-eyed. But something was amiss, and ifRobert Cieplensky hadn't spotted it someone might be dead now _ inNew York, perhaps, or Washington or Toronto _ from the shrapnel of ahomemade bomb.   Cieplensky, a New Jersey state trooper, saw a disheveled youngman in the rest area parking lot, walking in circles, looking undera car, heading one way, then another. When the man got into a brownMazda and pulled out _ narrowly missing parked cars, the troopersaid _ he stopped him.   The Mazda turned out to contain not just Yu Kikumura, lateridentified as a member of the terrorist Japanese Red Army, but alsoelectrical fusing devices, two clocks, precision tools, U.S. airlinetimetables, maps of New York City and other places, a bottle of TenHigh whiskey and 36 $100 bills.   A search also found three foot-long steel canisters packed withgunpowder and lead shot.   Kikumura faces sentencing Monday in Newark following his Novemberconviction for transporting the bombs ``with the knowledge andintent that they would be used to kill, injure and intimidate.''   Though no one knows the bombs' intended target _ sourcesspeculated it was a meeting of finance ministers in Washington or aneconomic summit in Toronto or that pinholes in a New York map markedthe spot _ Kikumura's case and others like it raise a troublingquestion:   Are Americans, who have long felt safe at home, becoming morevulnerable to terrorists?   ``The fact that we have been free from terrorist acts to theextent we have is in some ways amazing,'' said U.S. Attorney GeorgeTerwilliger III, who last year prosecuted three Lebanese nativesstopped just inside the Vermont-Canada border with makeshift bombs.Federal investigators said they belonged to an organization thatassassinated Lebanon's President-elect Bashir Gemayel.   ``Are we vulnerable? Absolutely,'' said Frank Bolz Jr., whoseconsulting firm trains other nations' police in handling terroristincidents.   ``This is a democratic country, with wide-open borders,'' addedBrian Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corp. think tank inSanta Monica, Calif. ``It's not as though we're protected by a highwall.''   Nonetheless, Jenkins said, the United States generally lacks thedriving forces of home-grown terrorism: ideology (usually``Americans kill in personal quarrels, not for causes'') and ethnicgrievances (the independence movement in Puerto Rico is anexception).   As for foreign terrorists, why attack on American soil when thereare convenient U.S. targets abroad, from embassies to fast-foodrestaurants? ``It's easier to cross a street than cross an ocean tocommit a terrorist attack,'' as Neil Livingstone, author of severalbooks on terrorism, put it.   Still, despite safeguards, bombers have slipped through.   Even though their numbers have not been great _ the FBI countsseven domestic terror incidents in the last year _ law enforcementofficials know the potential for destruction and intimidation ofeven a single well-placed explosive. (The Vermont bombs blew2-foot-square steel plates the length of a football field whenagents set them off.)   Americans' best protection, authorities say, will come fromcontinued toughening of anti-terror laws and swift justice for thosecaught. At least as important is intelligence work.   In Bolz' words, ``We have to get to know more about the enemy.''   ``We can't wait for the bomb to go off,'' said the FBI'scounterterrorism chief, Neil Gallagher, who added agents would use``whatever resources the judicial system would allow ... (to)neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs.''   Civil liberties groups are watching for overzealousness,something the FBI tacitly acknowledged last year in discipliningagents for an undercover probe of the Committee in Solidarity withthe People of El Salvador.   The FBI's counterterrorism effort costs tens of millions ofdollars annually, said Gallagher, who declined to be more specificbecause the budget is classified.   ``I always say it's been 95 percent blood, sweat and toil bythose agencies involved, but we've had a bit of good luck, too,''said Victoria Toensing, a former top terrorism policy official atthe Justice Department.   She said the tools of anti-terrorism have improved.   There's better cooperation among investigators and prosecutors _the FBI, which once balked, she said, now ``has the coffee waiting''for Justice Department lawyers called to an investigation. And lawshave been toughened _ extradition agreements have been revised, andit's now a federal crime to attack an American abroad, she noted.   These changes have not halted terror altogether. In 1986 alone,the worst recent year for domestic attacks, the FBI recorded 24incidents and nine preventions.   In 1987, the FBI's undercover sale of an inert anti-tank rocketto members of the Chicago-based El Rukns gang led to conspiracyconvictions and long prison terms. The government said they hadoffered to blow up U.S. targets for Libya.   ``A domestic group was willing to commit a terrorist act in theUnited States,'' the FBI said, ``in order to receive funding from aknown state sponsor of international terrorism.''   In Hartford, Conn., members of Los Macheteros, a Puerto Ricanseparatist group, are on trial now, charged with conspiracy in aviolent $7 million armed robbery there. And three allegedrevolutionaries accused of plotting a series of robberies andbombings, including one that injured 22, are being tried inMassachusetts.   A 1983 explosion 30 feet from the Senate chamber in the U.S.Capitol was blamed on a group protesting U.S. foreign policy.Security was overhauled. Senators were warned to remove identifyinglicense plates from cars. Seats in the House chamber got bulletproofbackings.   Before and since, groups have detonated explosives at banks, atgovernment offices, under police cars _ from anti-Castroorganizations in Miami to affiliates of the Aryan Nations in Idaho.The tradition of American terrorism goes back to the WeatherUnderground, to the 19th century coalminer-terrorist ``MollyMaguires'' in Pennsylvania, and beyond.   In recent years, the acts and threats have changed the Americanlandscape and lowered Americans' resistance to searches. Securitybarriers shield the White House and other public buildings, andairport scanners, having turned up 41,000 guns since 1973, are afact of life.   Not all of the security gates are closed, however, according toRobert Kupperman of the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies in Washington: ``If you hit some of the key nodes'' _ gastransmission lines, water systems or electric power grids _ ``you'regoing to have big trouble.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
