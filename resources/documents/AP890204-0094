Dues</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States has paid late U.N. duesof nearly $30 million, but it remains almost $500 million behind inpayments to the regular U.N. budget, officials said.   The United States is in the process of paying back money itwithheld several years ago when Washington complained of what itviewed as mismanagement and anti-Western bias at the United Nations.   Washington's second-ranking U.N. ambassador, Herbert S. Okun,delivered the $28.8 million dues check Friday to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. officials said. Healso gave Perez de Cuellar a $7.3 million check to help pay for U.N.peacekeepers in Cyprus.   The United States is assessed for one-fourth of the U.N.'sregular budget of about $880 million annually. Friday's paymentended U.S dues obligations for 1988.   However, U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhart said the UnitedStates still owes the world body $279 million for unpaid pre-1988dues and $216 million for 1989 dues.   In 1985, the Reagan administration and Congress began withholdingsubstantial amounts of U.N. dues to spur the world body into cuttingits staff and imposing fiscal reform. Reagan and several congressmenalso criticized the United Nations for what they viewed asanti-Western bias.   In September, however, Reagan announced he was satisfied with theU.N.'s progress toward reform and its role in mediating the Sovietwithdrawal from Afghanistan and the Iran-Iraq cease-fire. He saidthe United States would begin repaying the money it owed.</TEXT></DOC>
