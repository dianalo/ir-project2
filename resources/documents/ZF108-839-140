FARTHER.andP;  FIBEROPTIC CHANNELS ARE 1st MAJOR ADVANCE IN CHANNEL  ARCHITECTURE SINCESYSTEM/360.andM;IBM Wednesday announced Enterprise Systems Connection (ESCON) Architecture,using wide-band, high-speed fiber optic channels that allow customers tointerconnect their computer systems over miles instead of a few hundred feet.andM;With IBM's new ESCON products, the customer's traditional data center, or&quot;glass house,&quot; is expected to change dramatically.andP;  Processors and theirinput/output (I/O) devices, such as disk, tape and display controllers, canbe placed as far apart as nine kilometers, or 5.6 miles, allowing customersto build campus-wide computing systems.andM;The new ESA/390 interconnection architecture offers a new connection methodand technology that improve system availability by allowing customers to add,delete or service I/O devices without disrupting end users.andM;Customers with cramped computer equipment rooms will have a new level offlexibility with ESCON.andP;  Essential computing devices now can be located milesaway from the central processor, and they can operate in a &quot;lights out&quot;environment with little or no human intervention.andP;  I/O devices can besituated in less expensive locales.andP;  An enterprise with a data center in suchan area can now relocate I/O equipment to nearby sites where costs are lower.andM;FIBER OPTIC ESCON CHANNELS.andP;  The new fiber optic ESCON channels transfer databetween host computers or between a host and a controller at up to 10megabytes (million characters) a second, more than twice the speed ofcopper-cable parallel channels in wide use today.andP;  ESCON allows customers tochange the configuration of their systems while they continue operations,instead of being required to shut down their equipment as they do today.andM;FIBER OPTIC TECHNOLOGY REDUCES SPACE NEEDS An ESCON channel, using alight-emitting diode (LED) as a light source and a flexible glass filament asa transmission medium, converts light to and from electrical signals thatcomputers recognize as data.andM;With its smaller size, lighter weight and greater physical flexibility, fiberoptic cable dramatically reduces the amount of space required for computerroom cabling.andM;A half-inch diameter fiber optic trunk cable, for example, may contain 144fibers, providing 72 channel links.andP;  Trunks provide links between buildings,between floors or within a data center.andP;  A fiber optic trunk can weigh aslittle as 1.3 ounces per foot compared with 72 pounds per foot for equivalentcopper cabling, providing nearly a 900 times saving in weight.andM;Fiber optics also eliminate many of the undesirable electrical properties ofcopper, including electrical noise and noise spikes.andM;IBM's National Service Division (NSD), through its Customized OperationalServices (COS) Connectivity Services, will provide customer assistance inplanning, designing and installing fiber optic cabling systems.andM;DYNAMIC CONNECTIVITY A new set of hardware and software products will providedynamic connectivity -- the ability to switch channel-to-control unit andchannel-to-channel connections among several paths.andP;  Customers benefit fromthe decreased number of links, less disruptive I/O configuration changes, andimproved systems management and availability.andM;The focal point for dynamic connectivity is the ESCON Director, available intwo models, to which all ESCON channels and control units can be attached.andM;o Model 1, a desktop device, comes with eight ports, or attachment points,and is upgradable to either 12 or 16 ports.andM;o The floor-standing Model 2 comes with 28 ports, upgradable to 60 ports infour-port increments.andM;An ESCON Director can be attached by fiber optic cables to various IBMprocessors and control units.andP;  It also can attach to other ESCON Directors toprovide additional distance and configuration flexibility.andP;  Customers mayplug fiber optic cables into the ESCON Director while their systems areoperating, thus reducing down time.andM;9 KILOMETERS - CHANNEL-TOCHANNEL The ESCON Directors enhance ESCON'sintegrated channel-to-channel capability.andP;  With the channel-to-channelfunction now integrated into the channel, customers may place two ESCONDirectors between systems to extend the channel-to-channel distance to ninekilometers.andM;Customers will also have access to built-in ESCON capability on the 3990Model 2 and 3 Storage Control Unit, all models of the 3490 Magnetic TapeSubsystem, and two new channel-attached models of the 3174 EstablishmentController.andP;  To assist customers in migrating to the new ESCON architecture,both parallel channels and ESCON channel adapters can coexist on the 3990 and3490 control units.andM;To accommodate customers with currently installed IBM control units, theESCON Converter Model 1 translates parallel channel protocols into ESCONchannel protocols.andP;  Similarly, the ESCON Converter Model 2 permits attachmentof ESCON-capable 3990s to parallel channels on the ES/3090 E, S, and Jprocessors and on the ES/4381 Models 90E, 91E and 92E.andM;In a future field-installable enhancement, IBM will provide customers withintegrated ESCON channel support for the 3745 family of communicationcontrollers.andP;  Until this support is available, customers may use the ESCONConverter Model 1 with the 3745 parallel channel adapter.andP;  IBM also intendsto provide a Micro Channel adapter card for the RISC System/6000 to permitattachment to the ESCON channel.andM;Enhanced capability for the 3172 Interconnect Controller Model 1, whichoffers an ESCON Adapter, provides remote channel-to-channel attachment overwide-band digital transmission links, enabling customers to transfer largeamounts of data at high speeds to remote data centers thousands of milesdistant from the host channel.andM;Also, the new 3172 Model 2 provides customers with the ability to connect tothe standard 100-megabit-per-second fiber distributed data interface (FDDI)local area network.andP;  The 3172 Model 2 will support the ESCON channel in thefuture, providing a higher speed connection.andP;  The ESCON Manager (ESCM), alicensed program product running under MVS/ESA or VM/ESA, provides hostcontrol to help customers manage connections that use ESCON Directors.andP;  WithESCM, operators can display system-wide configuration and status informationfrom a single point of control, such as a NetView, ESCM or MVS masterconsole.andM;For single and multiple processors in an ESCON environment, the ESCONAnalyzer provides customers with easy diagnosis of link errors andcoordination of service for a fiber optic complex from a single operatorconsole.andM;With the ESCON Monitor System (ESCMS), customers may monitor power loss toequipment, as well as unauthorized intrusion, water leaks, temperaturevariations, smoke and fire.andP;  In case of fire, ESCMS can even call the nearestfire department.andP;  Using a dial-up phone network, ESCMS monitors, from asingle point, local and remote environmental factors and controls poweron/off.andP;  Power on/off is achieved via a power control local area network(LAN), while environmental monitoring is done via a sensor LAN.andP;  Both typesof LANs may be up to one mile long.andM;When multiple systems are interconnected and sharing workload, it is vitalthat they have synchronized clocks for serialization, transaction logging anderror logging.andP;  Customers now can use the Sysplex Timer to synchronizetime-of-day clocks among multiple processors, allowing accurate time-stampingof transactions within the sysplex.andM;Key Executives: M.
