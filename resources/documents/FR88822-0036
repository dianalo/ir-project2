In 1981, the Commission commenced an inquiry looking towards ways ofimproving the comparative renewal process (published November 9, 1981,46 FR 55279). As currently administered, this process permits individualsor entities to file competing applications against an incumbent licensee'srenewal application, necessitating a comparative hearing to determine whichapplicant is the best qualified to operate on the frequency in question.This entails utilizing criteria similar to those used in comparative hearingsfor new broadcast stations and also, for equitable and policy reasons,according an incumbent licensee credit for what is termed its renewal expectancyif its past programming service to its community of license has been ``meritorious.''2. Although this proceeding was initially intended to clarify the standardsused for determining when a renewal expectancy is warranted and to refinethe other comparative criteria used, the Commission believes that it maybe useful to expand the scope of this proceeding to attempt to curtailopportunities for abuse that may be inherent in the comparative renewalprocess. In particular, now that the Commission has begun a new cycle ofbroadcast renewal proceedings after a hiatus created by the statutory lengtheningof license terms, assertions and criticism have been voiced that unscrupulousparties may be using the renewal process for private gains unrelated toany public interest aims thereunder. The Commission believes that partiesmay be filing competing applications or petitions to deny for the primarypurpose of entering into settlement agreements for profit rather than forthe purposes of operating a broadcast station or informing the Commissionabout legitimate issues related to an incumbent's qualifications. 3. Because curtailing abuses is integrally related, and essential, to meaningfulreformation of the comparative renewal process, the Commission believesthat the breadth of this proceeding should be widened to consider possibleremedies to abuses that arise in the comparative renewal context. For example,the <T3>Notice </T3>asks commenters to consider the appropriateness and legalfeasibility of placing limits on payments for the withdrawal of competingapplications and petitions to deny and granting waiver requests to theselimits in appropriate circumstances. 4. With respect to settlement agreements involving the withdrawal of competingapplications, the Commission noted that in 1981 Congress enacted section311(d), which permitted comparative renewal applicants to enter into settlementagreements for valuable consideration not limited to the actual expendituresof the parties in prosecuting the renewal challenge. This legislation representeda departure from the Commission's prior practice of not approving settlementagreements in comparative renewal cases, absent compelling circumstances,and only approving settlement agreements limited to the actual expensesincurred by the applicant in prosecuting the renewal challenge. 5. In light of this legislative change, the <T3>Notice </T3>seeks comment on the statutory and other public interestauthority of the Commission to remedy settlement agreement abuses. Specifically,the Commission questions whether statutory provisions in the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 311(d)(3) overrode prior Commissionpolicy generally not to approve settlement agreements in comparative renewalproceedings, and if not, whether public interest considerations warrantreinstating such prior Commission policy or otherwise circumscribing suchagreements. One such approach, upon which comment is requested, would beto limit consideration that may be paid for the withdrawal of a competingapplication to legitimate and prudent out of pocket expenses in filingand prosecuting the application. Another approach would be to prohibitaltogether settlement payments for the dismissal of a competing application.6. In addition, since current rules simply require that the parties enteringinto a settlement agreement file a copy of the agreement and certify thattheir applications were not filed for the purpose of entering into thesettlement, the <T3>Notice </T3>also requests comment on methods for establishing the <T3>bona fides </T3>of an applicant. For example, the Commission couldstrengthen financial and ownership disclosure requirements, or requireapplicants to certify at the application, rather than at the settlementstage, that the application was filed for the purpose of securing Commissionauthorization to operate a broadcast facility.  7. The <T3>Notice </T3>also discusses proposals for deterring abuses which mayarise in the context of petitions to deny where consideration is paid forwithdrawal of petition to deny or a promise to refrain from filing a petitionto deny. The Commission does not wish to inhibit or otherwise discouragethe legitimate exercise or use of the petition to deny process by membersof the public. However, it seeks public comment on whether limiting paymentfor withdrawal of petitions to deny to legitimate and prudent expensesincurred in the preparation and filing such petitions in an appropriatemethod of ensuring that renewal applicants are not threatened with coercivepetitions to deny filed solely to extract financial or other considerationfrom the licensee.  8. As a related matter, the <T3>Notice </T3>addresses potential abuses that arise in the context ofcitizens agreements entered into with licensees. Since such agreementsmay involve the withdrawal of a petition to deny or a promise to refrainfrom filing a petition, the <T3>Notice </T3>proposes limiting such payments to reasonable and prudentout of pocket expenses but also solicits comment on possible waiver criteria.In additon, the <T3>Notice </T3>requests comment on whether it is appropriate for the Commissionto enforce programming obligations agreed to by broadcast licensees incitizen agreements. Although these petition to deny and citizens agreementproposals were recently made in a separate proceeding involving abuse ofprocess, the Commission decided that, in view of the somewhat limited responsein that proceeding, it would advance those proposals in this <T3>Notice </T3>insofar as they relate to the comparative renewal process. 9. In the area of comparative renewal criteria one main focus will be onwhether or not to modify the structural criteria (particularly diversificationof ownership and spectrum efficiency) used to compare challengers and incumbents.The Commission specifically requested comment on:  andbullet; The option of reducing the importance of diversification factorin the comparative renewal process, <T3>e.g., </T3>whether or not an otherwise fully qualified incumbent licenseewould be penalized for its other media interests as long as (1) they arein compliance with the Commission's ownership rules and policies and (2)there have been no adjudicated instances of antitrust or anticompetitivemisconduct;  andbullet; The proposal to continue using the integration of ownership andmanagment citerion (that is, giving an applicant a comparative preferenceif its owners will participate full-time in the management of the station)as currently administered. However, the Commission indicated that it willnot entertain any proposals which would alter the Commission's enhancementpolicies regarding females and minorities.  andbullet; Whether the Commission should modify or eliminate the currentpresumption that competing applicants who prevail in renewal hearings willbe able to acquire the transmitter sites of the incumbents;  andbullet; Any additional or alternative criteria commenters believe mayserve as a better guide for selecting a licensee than those currently inuse.  10.The final area considered in this action concerns how the Commissionshould define the standard that should be used to determine when an incumbentlicensee is entitled to a renewal expectancy. The proceeding presents twomajor approaches to defining renewal expectancy: a programming-based standardrelying on a concept of providing ``meritorious'' broadcast service, anda less programming-instrusive approach that is based on substantial compliancewith the Communications Act and the Commission's Rules and policies. TheCommission denotes the following issues for possible comment;  andbullet; Whether commenters believe the public interest is best servedby continuing or modifying the present programming-based renewal expectancyunder which an incumbent is given significant credit if its past programservice has been ``meritorious'' in meeting the needs and interests ofviewers and listeners in its community of license and service area;  andbullet; What standards should be utilized for determining when a pastbroadcast record is meritorious;  andbullet; Whether programming review should be limited to nonentertainmentprogramming or should include any programming which addresses communityneeds and interests;  andbullet; Whether the definitions of meritious service proposed in S. 1277and H.R. 3493 would be helpful in enabling the Commission to clarify whena renewal expectancy is warranted;  andbullet; Whether or not commenters agree with described deficiencies ofa programming-based renewal expectancy, including practical administrativeproblems and evidence this approach may chill speech or present other firstamendment problems.    11. As an alternative to retaining and modifying the meritorious servicestandard, the <T3>Notice </T3>proposed two less programming-intrusive bases for determiningrenewal expectancy. One such approach would be to utilize a substantivetest similar to that set forth in H.R. 1140. Under this test, a renewalexpectancy would be warranted if an incumbent has (1) broadcast materialresponsive to matters of concern to the residents of its service area;and (2) there have been no serious violations of the Communications Actor Commission rules or no other violations, which taken together, wouldconstitute a pattern of abuse. The first prong of this test, which essentiallycodifies the obligation under our radio and television deregulation ordersfor stations to broadcast programming responsive to community needs, eliminatesthe need for the Commission to place subjective labels_such as superior,meritorious, or minimal_on an incumbent's past programming and, instead,would focus upon whether a licensee has been reasonable in selecting issuesto address and airing programming responsive to these community needs.The second prong would ensure that there have been no serious statutoryor regulatory violations.  12. A second approach_which may be even less intrusive from a programmingstandpoint_would be to grant a renewal expectancy based upon a licensee's<T3>overall </T3>record of compliance with the Communications Act and theCommission's rules and policies. Under this alternative, a licensee wouldobtain a renewal expectancy based upon the licensee's demonstration ofgood faith compliance with the Commission's rules and regulations and statutoryrequirements. This would include the various program-related obligationsdiscussed above of providing issue-responsive programming. However, unlikethe preceding option, programming need not automatically be an issue inevery comparative renewal hearing. Rather, violations of the issue-responsiveprogram obligation, as well as any other type of rule or policy violation,would only be considered when raised by a petition to deny or by a complaint. 13. With respect to these less programming intrusive bases for determiningrenewal expectancy, commenters are asked to consider:  andbullet; What types of violations of the Communications Act or FCC rulesor policies are so serious as to diminish a licensee's renewal expectancy:andbullet; What process should be used to determine whether or not a violationof the Act or Commission rules or policies has occurred;andbullet; What level of compliance with statutory and regulatory requirementswarrants a renewal expectancy;andbullet; Whether these approaches are preferable to the present meritoriousservice standard;andbullet; Whether these approaches are consistent with the hearing requirementsof Section 309(d) of the Communications Act. 14. The Commission believes, for several reasons, that this further inquiryinto the comparative renewal process will serve the public interest. Byconsidering how we can deter abuses of the renewal process in this docket,we will be able to ensure the integrity of that process. In addition, theCommission hopes that, with the aid of the updated record provided thoughthis action, we will be able to refine or modify standards for determininga renewal expectancy so that regulatees, the industry, and the public willmore clearly understand the obligations of broadcast licensees. At thesame time, by re-evaluating the other comparative factors, we will be ableto make the comparative process more meaningful and fair to both challengersand incumbents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Authority Citation  </ITAG>15.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, adoptionof the abuse of process proposals involving settlement agreements wouldbenefit entities of all sizes because it would reduce or eliminate thenumber of competing applications or petitions to deny filed in bad faith.As a result, the number of comparative renewal hearings may be furtherreduced as well as the number of participants in such hearings. This maybe particularly beneficial to small entities with limited financial resourcesbecause it may obviate the need for costly comparative renewal hearingsor may reduce substantially the amount of money that could be paid as partof a settlement, enabling such small licensees to use the saved resourcesfor other purposes.  20. Likewise, modifying or refining the comparative criteria utilized incomparative renewal hearings_including renewal expectancy_would be beneficialto broadcasters of all sizes because the basis for comparison would bestreamlined and clarified. As a result, hearings could be simpler and lesscostly. Ths latter benefit would be particularly helpful to small licensees,who may not have sufficient resources for a prolonged comparative renewalhearing and appeal process.  21.
