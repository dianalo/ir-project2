Santa Cruz's present system of electing councilmembers citywide, or at large, would be abolished. Copying models already inplace in Watsonville and San Jose, the city instead would be divided intoseven council districts, each with one council member.;    Supporters havecomplained for years that students at the overwhelmingly liberal University ofCalifornia, Santa Cruz have unfairly tilted local election results to theleft.;    Neighborhood residents' votes have been, in effect, nullified by thefour UCSC precincts that vote for liberal candidates by margins of up to 20 to1, conservatives and middle-of-the-road candidates such as Quartararo havecharged.;    Supporters have 200 days to gather roughly 4,500 valid signaturesof voters to place the measure on the November 1992 ballot.;    Porter, whodrafted the initiative, downplayed charges that the group is trying toneutralize UCSC students by allowing them only one representative on aseven-member council.;    But others, from liberal Councilman Scott Kennedy toconservative leader Louis Rittenhouse, said the district lines could be drawnin such a way that Santa Cruz's few conservative neighborhoods would beincluded in larger liberal districts, thus guaranteeing the liberals even morepower than their current 5-2 council majority.;    &quot;It very feasibly could bemore damaging than it is right now,&quot; Rittenhouse said.;    According to theplan, the city council would draw the district boundaries, establishing sevenareas each containing about 7,500 residents.;    Porter said residents wouldvehemently protest any attempt at unfair boundary drawing. But in virtuallyevery state in the country, including California, &quot;gerrymandering&quot; districtsfor political advantage is a timeworn tradition.;    A local example: Becausethere are about 3,100 beds on the UCSC campus, the adjacent west-side cityneighborhoods would almost certainly be included in the UCSC district.;    Oneof those neighborhoods, Westlake, is the city's primary conservativestronghold. Many observers predicted that if it were included in a UCSCdistrict, Rittenhouse would lose his seat to a UCSC student.;    Rittenhouseargued that a better solution would be for city officials to de-annex theuniversity from the city altogether.;    &quot;There is a large group of people upthere that doesn't look at issues and doesn't deal in reality,&quot; Rittenhousesaid of UCSC. &quot;It's a four-year hotel sitting up there on the hill -- youdon't let people who are staying at the Dream Inn vote. Why should they?&quot;;   Kennedy predicted that once liberals find out that they could gain even morepolitical power with districting, they and UCSC students ironically will lineup to sign the petitions.;    Calling the initiative &quot;sour grapes and poorsportsmanship&quot; from people who can't find any other way to win elections,Kennedy said he will not support districts because they would pit neighborhoodagainst neighborhood.;    Glen Schaller, co-chairman of Students forProgressive City, said he wanted to more closely examine the initiative beforeforming an opinion.;    But he predicted conservatives &quot;looking for a panacea&quot;could be surprised. &quot;They may shoot themselves in the foot on this,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910416  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  603  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 16, 199100107161,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
