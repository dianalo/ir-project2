 Whenever one of the Old Guardpublishers hits a rough spot, the industry is ready to pounce withpredictions of gloom for the future.andP;  Ashton-Tate is the latesttarget of the bad press, and more than a little of the criticismis justified.andP;  The company was long noted for its innovation, butthe same structure that nurtured innovation also causedconsiderable trouble, particularly in product execution.andP;  Thosewho predict a short road to the bankruptcy courts for the companyare mistaken: Ashton-Tate's flagship dBASE III Plus and IVproducts still outsell the leading competitor by five to one, andthere are over three million dBASE users worldwide.andP;  The companyis taking the tough actions it has to take to turn its fortunesaround, which is good for the company, the industry as a whole,and the user community.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Ashton-Tate (management).andO;Ticker:    TATE.andO;Topic:     Software PublishersCompany ProfileData Base Management SystemsFinancial StabilityOutlook.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ONE MAN'S OPINION--A COMPANY GROWS UP--THE SAGA OF ASHTON-TATE They didthings differently back in the halcyon days of personal computers.andP;  Thosewere the days when the comers in the software industry thrived on innovationand &quot;hacker&quot; wasn't a dirty word.andP;  Those were the days when Billion DollarBill was still dreaming up an operating system, CP/M was a force to reckonwith, the dBASE II was about the only database you could buy.andP;  Those were thedays.andM;Times have changed.andP;  The renegades in the computer business have traded intheir faded jeans for three piece suits and the bottom line is 'king.'andP;  Thereis little about the personal computer industry today that harks back to thosedays in the 70's.andP;  Today it's all business.andP;  But every now and then one ofthe old timers stubs a toe and the marketplace is all over him.andM;It happened to Lotus.andP;  They refused to intro release 3.0 until it was ready,and took a lot of flack.andP;  When it came out followed quietly by two morereleases, everyone applauded and the bad press was forgotten overnight.andP;  Thelatest victim is Ashton-Tate.andM;Now I'm not saying that A-T hasn't earned a few of the brickbats being tossedat it.andP;  But there was, until recently, a lot of that old time,seat-of-the-pants flying going on in the house that dBASE built.andP;  The goodnews is that, like the 70's, that attitude spawned a lot of innovation.andP;  Thebad news is that it caused a lot of trouble.andP;  dBASE IV was wonderfullyconceived and badly executed.andP;  Now, A-T is paying the price.andM;I've heard people speculate that there's so much trouble in Tate land thatthe company is headed straight for the bankruptcy courts.andP;  A-T swallowed apoison pill last year to avoid a hostile takeover.andP;  Doom and gloom.... doomand gloom.andP;  But, you know what?andP;  That's all horse puckie!andM;You'll read (if you haven't already) in the feature story this month (&quot;What'sReally Happening at Ashton-Tate?&quot;) that dBASE IV and III Plus are still theworld's best selling databases by a 5 to 1 margin.andP;  dBASE IV has been onSoftsel's and Ingram Micro D's best seller lists for over 50 straight weeks.andO;And dBASE IV has been on Software Magazine's corporate best seller list for11 straight months.andP;  There are over 3 Million dBASE users worldwide--notcounting users of dBASE language clones.andP;  If that's a failure, sign me up.andO;I'll be glad to fail, too, at that rate.andM;So what happened?andP;  Progress happened, that's all.andP;  And one of our industry'svenerable leaders stubbed its toe.andP;  That sharks smelled blood and now it'stime for A-T to regroup.andP;  What does that mean?andP;  In the business world itmeans cutting overhead.andP;  You get about ten times the effect on the bottomline from a 10% decrease in costs than from a 10% increase in sales.andP;  Itmeans changing management styles and, sometimes, managers.andP;  It meansreorienting corporate objectives.andP;  And it means taking a long, hard andsometimes painful look in the mirror.andP;  A-T is doing all those things.andP;  Theycost money and they cost time, but they're absolutely necessary.andM;I applaud the actions at A-T because, although I have been as vocal as thenext writer about the wrong things the Tates have done with dBASE IV, I haveevery release of the database and I've written books on the language.andP;  Thatmakes me a member of the world's largest programming fraternity--users of thedBASE language.andP;  It's a good language and the latest superset may even be agreat language.andP;  We'll see.andM;Deep down, like most writers on database subjects, I don't want our industryto loose an institution.andP;  I want competition, SQL, database servers,motherhood and apple pie, certainly, but our industry needs the Ashton-Tatesand the Microsofts that took us into this new age.andP;  It needs the experienceof the past and the vision of the future.andP;  But it also needs solidprofessional business men and women to put the polish on the hacker's roughedges.andP;  It needs marketing savvy and financial sense.andP;  It needs to beresponsive to users with a far wider range of ability levels and needs thanever before.andP;  The software industry needs to become an industry ofprofessionals because it now serves a market comprised of professionals.andM;Is that good?andP;  Certainly for the user community it is a requirement that ourindustry mature.andP;  For investors in software companies, it is important thatthey make a profit.andP;  For the state of the art, we must begin to innovate inthe orderly, professional manner other engineering and technical disciplineshave.andP;  But deep in my heart, although I am foursquare behind what I suspectto be the emerging new Ashton-Tate, I have a tear to shed for the innocenceof lost youth.andP;  But that's just one man's opinion......andO;</TEXT></DOC>
