(FDC)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)RHODE ISLAND (RI)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Federal banking regulators, responding topolitical and business pressure from New England, areexpanding efforts to protect thousands of borrowers fromlosing loans they received from the failed Bank of NewEngland.   In a meeting with three New England senators, regulatorsannounced several moves to encourage banks to maintain,rather than call, troubled loans to businesses. New Englandborrowers have been complaining that the calling of loans byRecoll Management Corp., the Fleet/Norstar Financial Groupunit that began liquidating $6 billion of troubled loansafter Fleet took over the Bank of New England, is forcingmany of them into bankruptcy proceedings.</LP><TEXT>   The measures apply to $1.2 billion of so-called performingnonperforming loans, on which the borrowers are makingrequired payments, although the loans are technically indefault because the value of collateral has declined sharply.To encourage healthy banks to purchase such loans, FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William Taylor said theagency would protect purchases from loss for three years. Theprotection would give purchasers the right to sell the loansback to the FDIC if it is determined that the borrowers won'tbe able to repay them.   In addition, national bank regulators from the Office ofComptroller of the Currency said they won't classify suchloans as troubled credits, a designation that would requirethe purchaser to reserve against potential loss, as long asthe government agrees to buy back the loan.   Both steps are extensions of current programs to cushionthe shock of bank failures by maintaining existing lines ofcredit to troubled borrowers, betting that an economicrecovery will enable them to repay the loans. But the timingof the moves -- less than two weeks before the New Hampshireprimary -- is likely to be seen as a Bush administrationeffort to ease New England's economic misery.   In November, Fleet and the FDIC announced that Fleet wouldbuy more than $500 million of the $1.2 billion of troubledloans from Recoll, with a three-year option to sell them backto the government. Yesterday, the FDIC said it would offerloans that Fleet doesn't buy to other banks on the sameterms. The FDIC recently granted similar treatment to $53million of loans made by failed banks in New Hampshire.   The November program and its expansion also include athree-year FDIC guarantee of new loans of as much as 10% ofthe initial loan to help borrowers meet working capitalneeds. This provision is designed to help borrowers throughtight credit conditions to increase the chances of theirsurvival.   Mr. Taylor described the measures in a meeting with SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), Sen. WilliamCohen (R., Maine) and Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.). &quot;Today'sdevelopments should provide some encouragement for the viablesmall businesses who have had their loans taken over byRecoll,&quot; said Sen. Cohen. &quot;The FDIC's decision to guaranteetheir loans should get them out from under the threat ofliquidation.&quot;   In response to complaints that Recoll hasn't followedproper procedures in managing and disposing of the $6 billionof Bank of New England loans it is servicing for the FDIC,Mr. Taylor told the senators that the agency would publiclyreiterate its policies for dealing with performingnonperforming loans and for giving borrowers the right toappeal how their loans are classified.</TEXT></DOC>
