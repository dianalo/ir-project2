 Inthis sense, they are maintenance burdens, conceived before the advent ofcomputer-aided software engineering (Case) technology, consuming 70% to 80%of MIS resource and budget dollars.andM;Alternately, they are valuable corporate assets, representing investments ofperhaps hundreds of millions of dollars.andP;  Corporate financial managers wantto see competitive returns on such substantial investments.andM;To square these two conflicting versions of reality, MIS is looking todiscover better ways to extend and upgrade aging application software.andM;Jack Wilson, system reengineering consultant at Amoco, Chicago, said hiscompany assesses its application portfolio replacement value at over severalhundred million dollars.andP;  &quot;As with other Amoco assets, management also wantsto ensure that investments in these assets return a reasonable value toAmoco,&quot; he said.andM;He acknowledged that &quot;finding quality people to support systems that useobsolete and superseded technologies is difficult.&quot;andP;  Amoco is investigatingseveral options, including reengineering and reverse engineering, to preserveand leverage software investments.andM;Case, and now the Integrated-Case (I-Case) technology, as opposed tocomponent Case, has evolved to where most MIS organizations are either usingor considering some type of Case tool.andP;  Many organizations are interested inpursuing &quot;full life-cycle Case,&quot; which stresses a complete and integratedapproach to creating new application systems, utilizing top-downmethodologies such as Information Engineering.andP;  This data-oriented approach,most often associated with consultant and author James Martin, isincorporated in tools from KnowledgeWare, Atlanta, and Texas Instruments,Plano, Tex.andM;Al Case, program director at the Detroit office of the Gartner Group, amarket research firm, said, &quot;Case technology provides a 30% to 40% reductionin maintenance on systems designed and generated using an integrated tool.andO;The power of an integrated repository, under products such as TexasInstruments' IEF [Information Engineering Facility] or CGI Systems' Pacbase,provides excellent inquiry and impact analysis capabilities for maintainers,&quot;said Case.andM;This is apparently good news for MIS organizations looking at I-Casetechnology.andP;  According to Case, &quot;The three leaders in the I-Case arena rightnow are TI, CGI [Pearl River, N.Y.] and Andersen Consulting's [Chicago]Foundation.&quot;andM;Supporting the argument for Integrated Case is Pete Privateer, director ofproduct programs for KnowledgeWare.andP;  &quot;Based on recent market surveys,component Case technology is falling by the wayside,&quot; he said.andP;  The factthat, according to Privateer, KnowledgeWare has over 2,500 installedcustomers is a good sign that the MIS community supports this belief.andO;Privateer conceded that &quot;80% of application tasks are focused on existingsystems.&quot;andM;The IBM user group Guide has long recognized the need for a reengineeringmigration path from today's aging systems to I-Case.andP;  The Guide projectcommittee responsible for publishing a paper on Application Reengineering in1988 regrouped in 1989, and is about to release a strategy paper to IBM onreverse engineering.andM;As for what course of action is available today, Case from the Gartner Groupsaid &quot;little or nothing.&quot;andP;  However, tools and techniques continue to emerge.andM;EMERGING TECHNOLOGIESandM;Organizations seeking a migration path from today's vast informationportfolios to an I-Case environment under improved architectures have analmost confusing selection of options.andP;  Managing these choices under anintegrated environment, customized to the unique requirements of a givenorganization, is clearly a challenge.andM;&quot;Organizations need to take a multipronged attack or they will end upapplying short-term solutions to their long-term requirements,&quot; said RichardBergeon, vice president, division manager of applied technology, SecurityPacific Automation Company (SPAC), Glendale, Calif.andP;  SPAC is a wholly ownedbusiness of the financial services giant Security Pacific Corporation andprovides MIS support for the entire company.andM;Security Pacific has multiple data centers with multiple hardware types inmultiple locations, but has similar needs to most organizations.andP;  &quot;We havetaken a three-pronged approach to the situation,&quot; said Bergeon.andP;  &quot;The firstcomponent of this approach was to get people familiar with modeling at a highlevel.andP;  Security Pacific uses KnowledgeWare's IEW [Information EngineeringWorkbench] product to perform these tasks.andM;&quot;The second component involves modeling functions of current applicationswith a focus on optimization, an important issue for Security Pacific.andP;  Thethird component is to push Case down to the 'lowest levels' by coding fromthese specification models,&quot; said Bergeon.andP;  Security Pacific has not yetselected an application generator product.andM;&quot;As a precursor to establishing this software engineering environment,&quot; saidBergeon, &quot;Security Pacific selected the Information Engineering methodology,created organizational models and established a program for the study ofquality productivity within the MIS group.&quot;andM;Other organizations also recognize the need to establish procedures prior toapplying advanced technology to a set of problems.andP;  Patricia Seymour, managerof systems renewal at Pacific Bell, San Ramon, Calif., said, &quot;Lack ofconsistent standards and methods across the Systems Technology community isof major importance today.andP;  Systems Technology has created a systemsdevelopment and maintenance environment to address this major issue.andO;Resources have been focused in this area and much progress has been made.andO;Once the methods and procedures are in place, we look for the tools tosupport them.&quot;andM;Organizations looking to establish procedures and methods for migratinglegacy systems into a sophisticated I-Case environment do not have much todraw from in the way of industry examples.andP;  Various consulting firms, such asChicago-based Ernst andamp; Young, offer some support in this area by working upthe Information Engineering ladder in reverse.andP;  &quot;Ernst andamp; Young can addressunique customer concerns and leverage the use of the IEW repository forexisting systems,&quot; said KnowledgeWare's Privateer.andM;Other firms, such as IBM Consulting's National Conversions Center, Chicago,and Peat Marwick's Advanced Technology Group, Chicago, can also help fillthis methodology void.andP;  But for the most part, organizations must seek anapproach that is reasonable for their unique technical and culturalenvironments.andM;THE TOOLS--CHICKEN OR EGG?andM;In many cases, organizations should define the problem and an appropriatesolution before applying software tools to a situation.andP;  Conversely, certaintools can assist organizations in defining solutions.andP;  As noted earlier,Security Pacific's use of the IEW assisted in establishing the firm'sthree-pronged approach to Case integration.andP;  Other tools support thisdirection as well.andM;One vendor that provides a customizable, workstation environment forcontrolling procedures and tools is the Delphi Group from San Diego.andO;Delphi's director of marketing and sales, Luis Rivera, said, &quot;The mainpurpose of the Software Engineering Environment [SEE] system is to facilitatethe integration of productivity factors into an online workstationenvironment.andP;  This environment includes Case tools and the methodology tomaximize their use.&quot;andP;  Security Pacific uses the Delphi Group's SEE system tocontrol its platform-independent software engineering environment.andM;Technology of this type begins to offer organizations a way to capture andimplement methods, standards and procedures across the MIS environment.andP;  AtSecurity Pacific, these tools extend beyond traditional Case offerings toinclude reengineering products such as PM/SS, the data definition analysisproduct from Adpac Corporation, San Francisco.andM;&quot;SEE manages the tools and the methodology under an integrated,platform-independent environment,&quot; according to Bergeon.andP;  &quot;Customers can usethe methodology that comes with the SEE product or create their owncustomized environment based on their unique MIS requirements,&quot; added Rivera.andM;One area of technology aimed specifically at leveraging the information assetis application reengineering.andP;  While the definition of this term has beenmuddled over the years, the value of the technology has grown.andP;  According tothe 1988 Guide paper, reengineering &quot;is the application of tools, techniquesand methods to cost-effectively extend the useful life of applicationsystems.&quot;andP;  The paper goes on to list language conversion, source coderestructuring, data definition rationalization and code reaggregation astypical reengineering activities.andM;Over the last five years or so, reengineering tools have grown in number andcapability.andP;  Pacific Bell's Seymour said, &quot;Reengineering is being done to cutongoing maintenance costs and ready systems for migration to new platforms.&quot;andM;Pacific Bell also seeks out evolving technology.andP;  According to Seymour, &quot;Weare looking to participate in the beta test of Via Renaissance from Viasoft.&quot;andO;(Viasoft is based in Phoenix.)andM;Amoco is utilizing reengineering technology, including source code analyzersand a restructuring tool.andP;  The firm is also &quot;investigating the Bachmantechnology for relational database migration and tools to migrate assemblermacro programs to a higher-level language,&quot; according to Amoco's Wilson.andP;  Hebelieves that #there are enough tools currently available so we can startthis challenging process [of enhancing the value of information assets.]&quot;andM;The reengineering tools leverage current maintenance staffs while preparingtoday's systems for future migration.andP;  In this way, organizations can workfrom the bottom-up, stabilizing current systems with reengineering, whileconcurrently familiarizing MIS professionals with I-Case technology andInformation Engineering methods from the top-down.andM;Use of these tools in today's MIS environment can help organizationsformulate a longer-term transformation strategy.andP;  The technology to supportthis longer-term transformation effort, however, is at the beginning of itsevolutionary stage.andP;  This transformation technology is generally known asreverse engineering.andM;MISSING LINK: REVERSE ENGINEERINGandM;The Guide Reverse Engineering Project defines reverse engineering as &quot;theprocess of extracting, standardizing and documenting data descriptions andprogram logic from an implementation-dependent form to animplementation-independent form and migrating to an automated softwareengineering environment.&quot;andP;  Reverse engineering is the least mature of thetechnologies discussed thus far, but there has been progress made in two keyareas: repository technology and data reverse engineering.andM;Repository technology, at least vendor-proprietary repositories, is evolvingfairly quickly.andP;  Reverse engineering of data descriptions is anothertechnology that is maturing quite rapidly.andP;  Evolution in both areas isevidenced by the fact that Bachman Information Systems, Inc., a Burlington,Mass., company specializing in the reverse engineering of data, was selectedas a member of the &quot;inner circle&quot; of IBM Application Development Cycle(AD/Cycle) partners.andM;But the Guide Reverse Engineering Project defined three areas of reverseengineering in addition to the repository: the data, the processes and theenvironmental system objects.andP;  The project identified the AD/Cycle Repositoryas the target storage medium, while acknowledging the need forvendor-specific, interim repositories.andP;  While data definition reverseengineering continues to progress, the evolution of the environmental, andmore importantly, the process component of reverse engineering, is strategicto long-term I-Case migration.andM;InterPort Software Corporation, Fairfax, Va., supports the analysis andcapture of system objects at all three levels for eventual export into a Caseenvironment.andP;  This is accomplished with its InterCase product.andM;&quot;The three main areas of focus for InterCase are to understand, control andredevelop existing applications,&quot; said Mark Crego, president of InterPort.andO;&quot;Aetna Life and Casualty is looking at all three potential uses forInterCase.andP;  The product can look at every aspect of a system, both broad anddetailed, and walk the user through its Structured Database [SDB].&quot;andM;According to Crego, &quot;The controlling aspect of InterCase comes from itsability to interface with configuration management tools.andP;  The capacity tounderstand systems can be accomplished through online query of the SDB orthrough InterCase's capacity to feed other tools, including the Excelerator[from Index Technology, Cambridge, Mass.] and the IEW repositories.&quot;andM;The redevelopment aspect, however, is the feature that seems to attract themost industry attention.andM;Since InterCase can export system data and functional definitions into designrepositories, such as the IEW and Excelerator, and application generators,such as the APS tool from Sage Software, Inc., Rockville, Md., it broadensthe scope of opportunities for organizations interested in making the Casetransition.andP;  Crego added, &quot;The design tools and the generators cannot alwaysdirectly accept InterCase's outputs.andP;  For example, a restructuring toolshould be used first before attempting to import and export system processlogic to an application generator.&quot;andM;Other work is progressing in this area as well.andP;  According to Case from theGartner Group, &quot;The I-Case vendor with the strongest commitment to reverseengineering is CGI, with their new release of Pacreverse.andP;  The focus of thistool is to load the Pacbase repository with current system components andmake them available for reuse in subsequent system redevelopment efforts.&quot;andM;&quot;Pacific Bell is also beta testing new technology from Andersen Consulting tosupport reverse engineering,&quot; according to PacBell's Seymour.andM;Outside of the MIS arena, Cadre Technologies, a Beaverton, Ore., Casecompany, developed PathMap to support the reverse engineering of complex,embedded systems.andP;  According to a company spokesperson, &quot;It is not uncommonto encounter programs with 100,000 to 400,000 lines of code&quot; in the embeddedsystems market.andP;  PathMap supports runtime analysis and the subsequentcreation of Constantine structure charts to document exactly what a programis doing.andP;  It will be interesting to see if this technology becomes availablein the commercial MIS world.andM;Numerous advances are being made in the area of reverse engineering.andP;  This isparticularly true with respect to capturing and loading system-wideinformation into a repository and then allowing the MIS professional tobrowse or chart this information.andP;  As noted, both InterPort and CGI aremaking progress in this area.andM;Reverse engineering tools assist in determining what a system really does andthen either provides a means to modify the system at the design level orexports information into a Case tool for redesign.andP;  Because this technologyis so new, organizations should be cautious about incorporating it intolong-term MIS strategies.andM;REVERSE ENGINEERING NOT A PANACEAandM;It is important to reinforce the need to define new architectures and selecttransformation methods and standards prior to deploying sophisticated reverseengineering technology within an MIS organization.andP;  Tools can assist inleveraging the existing application asset in the implementation of new andimproved systems under modified or revamped architectures.andM;Security Pacific has emphasized the Information Engineering approach bydefining information needs at the highest levels of the organization first,and then applying bottom-up analysis methods.andP;  Pacific Bell has stressed theestablishment of methods and standards prior to unleashing new reverseengineering technology.andM;Reverse engineering is not a panacea.andP;  Organizations should avoid the mistakeof reimplementing obsolete processes under I-Case technology.andP;  Futurebusiness requirements must be accommodated through organizationaladjustments.andP;  Changes to the business must then be reflected throughsubsequent MIS planning and strategic requirements definition.andM;Once this effort is completed, reverse engineering can be effectivelyutilized to populate new designs under integrated architectures.andP;  Only thencan organizations reap the benefits envisioned under the reverse engineeringscenario.andM;The advent of this technology has produced new challenges on every level.andO;Communicating these issues to senior management can be as much work asdefining the problem/solution set.andP;  Education at all levels of theorganization is key to this &quot;cultural adjustment.&quot;andM;&quot;Educating our technical force and management staff is a vital element to thesuccess of our reverse engineering methodology,&quot; said PacBell's Seymour.andO;&quot;This education will minimize the confusion that is arising from some of thedistortions and inaccuracies being published regarding reverse engineering.&quot;andM;Seymour's group has been chartered with not only developing, butcommunicating and deploying Pacific Bell's reverse engineering methodology; atask far more difficult than selecting and installing new software tools.andM;LEGACY SYSTEMS AND AD/CYCLEandM;And what of IBM's role in the quest to migrate legacy systems into anintegrated Case environment?andP;  Can organizations look toward AD/Cycle toeventually support a transformation framework?andM;AD/Cycle is IBM's framework for supporting application development tasksacross the systems life cycle.andP;  Its goal is to support information controland sharing, and provide an integration point for tools and methodologies.andO;Early AD/Cycle announcements focused on new development tasks, primarily atthe planning and enterprise analysis level.andP;  But where does AD/Cycle fit inthe short and long term?andM;Denis Clark, U.S.andP;  marketing services director for Application EnablingSoftware Marketing, IBM, Purchase, N.Y., said, &quot;While the initial AD/Cycleannouncement focused on new development, a number of products are availabletoday to support customers with large application portfolios.andP;  These productsinclude software to support compiler upgrades, Cobol restructuring with theCobol Structuring Facility and other third-generation language support.&quot;andP;  Headded, &quot;There are also IBM tools to support regression testing, test coverageanalysis and software process management--all of which are components ofAD/Cycle.&quot;andM;According to Clark, &quot;There is significant customer interest in tools that cancapture information from current systems and store this information in theAD/Cycle Repository for analysis and eventual redesign.&quot;andP;  He added, &quot;TheBachman tools support this activity in the data area, but specific tools toaddress this activity for applications are not yet part of the AD/Cycleframework.andM;&quot;IBM is planning to package internal tools and selected AD/Cycle products ina more complete solution to address these customers' requirements.&quot;andP;  Clarkdid not specify a time frame for this announcement.andM;&quot;In terms of a separate methodology to support migration to an I-Caseenvironment, AD/Cycle is a methodology-independent framework.andP;  IBM iscurrently investigating technology, however, to help customers build acustomized framework within their own environment,&quot; according to Clark.andO;&quot;Customer advisory councils, customer sessions held at the East and WestCoast IBM briefing centers, and the IBM user groups, Guide and Share, allprovide input to this overall planning process.&quot;andM;Among Big 6 firms, Price Waterhouse has recently announced a push into thereengineering market, with its Reengineering Center and Re/Cycle efforts tocombine tools and services to &quot;recycle&quot; existing software to DB2, Case andeventually AD/Cycle.andP;  [See Software Magazine, November, cover story.]andM;Numerous tools and multiple methods are required to migrate legacyinformation systems toward an I-Case environment.andP;  The sheer number of toolsand the diversity of techniques involved mandate a clear need fororganizations to integrate their strategies regarding full life-cycle Caseand the reclamation of embedded knowledge from legacy systems.andM;Are most firms focusing on an integrated strategy to evolve legacy systemsinto new architectures through a phased approach?andP;  Or are Pacific Bell,Security Pacific and Amoco anomalies in the MIS industry?andM;One major corporation, considered a technological leader by most MISstandards, declined to be interviewed for this article because it was justbeginning to establish these kinds of strategies and needed time to assessits situation before speaking publicly.andP;  If this methodical approach is arepresentative trend, then the industry is moving in the right direction.andM;It will require careful planning and strong management commitment toestablish methods and standards, build a customized transformation strategyand maximize the strengths of I-Case, IBM's AD/Cycle and niche vendorproducts.andP;  Bergeon, Seymour and Wilson would probably assert that the time toget moving is now.andM;Ulrich is a principal with the Tactical Strategy Group, Aptos, Calif., aconsulting firm specializing in redevelopment strategies and deployment.andO;Ulrich has over 10 years of experience in developing reengineering strategiesfor large-scale MIS organizations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
