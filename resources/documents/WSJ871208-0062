Mr. Ongpin's son Rafael called his father's death an &quot;apparent suicide&quot; and said his father, who was 49 years old, had been unhappy since he was forced from the cabinet of President Corazon Aquino in a mid-September shuffle. Mr. Ongpin, who had been president of Benguet Corp., a large mining company, was a severe critic of the corrupt &quot;crony capitalism&quot; of former President Ferdinand Marcos and advised Mrs. Aquino in her attempt to oust him. He joined her cabinet in February 1986 after Mr. Marcos fled the country.    As finance secretary, he had been responsible for negotiating a restructuring of the country's $26 billion foreign debt, but those attempts brought him criticism from cabinet colleagues who disagreed with and blocked his free-market policies to revive the economy. Mr. Ongpin, in turn, had been sharply critical of bureaucratic bungling that he said had paralyzed the Aquino administration. </TEXT></DOC>
