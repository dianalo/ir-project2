First, the paper deals with the possible descriptions of turbulentflows and suitable measuring methods. Piezoelectrical sensors were investigated.In small-scale tests and in industrial-scale tests on the sylvinite flotationand tin ore flotation the influence of the cell geometrie, the designof the rotor-stator-system, impeller speed and specific air flow waselucidated.
