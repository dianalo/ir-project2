Gorbachevarrived today for his first state visit to West Germany and heldtalks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl that reportedly focused on armsreductions.   Gorbachev met with Kohl for more than an hour at the chancellor'soffice in talks that concerned President Bush's May 29 proposal tocut conventional arms in Europe, West German television reported.   A West German government spokesman, Manfred Oblaender, said theinitial round of talks was ``more substantial and intense'' thanexpected, and that it had been extended. He would not elaborate.   A wedge of motorcycle police led the Soviet leader's blacklimousine to the chancellor's office, and Gorbachev waved from theopen car window to a crowd of 100 people, some of whom had stood inthe hot afternoon sun for nearly an hour.   Friedbert Pflueger, a spokesman for West German President Richardvon Weizsaecker, said an earlier one-hour meeting between theWeizsaecker and Gorbachev focused on political and private subjects.   He said that Gorbachev also discussed the new NATO arms controlproposals with Weizsaecker, the titular West German head of state,in preparation for a joint statement by the two governments. He didnot elaborate.   The Soviet president came to strengthen ties between East andWest, an objective that goes to the heart of this divided nation.   ``I arrived with the best feelings and with the wish to doeverything so that our relationship and cooperation can developfurther,'' Gorbachev said in a brief exchange with televisionreporters at the state residence, Villa Hammerschmidt.   ``I'm using the opportunity of this first interview to wish thecitizens of the federal republic health and well-being,'' he toldWest Germany's ZDF TV.   Much of Gorbachev's visit was being broadcast live.   The Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, emerged from theirAeroflot Ilyushin-62 jet at Cologne-Bonn airport this morning andstood somberly for a 21-gun salute before descending to the tarmacfor a hearty greeting from Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.   The Kremlin motorcade of four ZILs made a detour to the SovietEmbassy before proceeding under a helicopter security escort to theVilla Hammerschmidt for a sun-splashed welcome by Weizsaecker andKohl.   During his current four-day visit to West Germany, Gorbachevleaves behind rioting in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistanand two weeks of sharp debate in the new Congress over politicalpower and economic failures.   His talks with West German officials will give him a chance toconcentrate on foreign policy, his area of greatest success in fouryears in power, and the technology and financial help needed tomodernize the Soviet economy.   Gorbachev's agenda includes meetings with scientific and businessleaders and factory tours.   Gorbachev says Germany is at the center of what he calls ``ourcommon European home.'' Public opinion polls in West Germany havefound him to be the most popular foreign leader ever.   Soviet officials, speaking at a briefing Sunday in Bonn, saidthat the Western allies need not fear that Gorbachev might try towoo West Germany to unite with Communist East Germany in a neutralentity.   Georgy A. Arbatov, head of the Kremlin's U.S.A.-Canada Institute,said the division of Europe is unnatural but ``it's up to Germany todecide its political status.   ``We're not exerting any behind-the-scenes pressure.''   He said the Soviet Union, instead of imposing solutions on itsEastern Euopean allies, is committed to accept reforms in countriessuch as Poland and Hungary to solve problems that have beenfestering for years.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov was askedabout European fears of German-Soviet cooperation similar to theHitler-Stalin non-aggression pact signed just before the Nazisstarted World War II.   He replied, ``Three things have changed since 1940. First, theSoviet Union has changed. Second, Germany has changed. Third, theworld has changed. How can you make comparisons?''   West Germany is NATO's front-line state facing the Warsaw Pactalliance and Kohl has pressed the Western allies to acceptGorbachev's proposal for immediate talks to eliminate short-rangenuclear missiles. Most of the weapons are on German soil.   The United States and Britain disagreed with Kohl but a compomisewas reached at last month's NATO summit in Brussels. The allianceagreed to a proposal by Bush to couple negotiations on short-rangemissiles with progress on reduction of conventional forces.   Gorbachev offered in May to withdraw 500 Soviet nuclear weapons,but Soviet officials said it was unlikely he would come to Bonn witha response to the Bush proposal.   ``For about five months the Bush administration wouldn't answerour proposals,'' Arbatov said. ``Then they make a proposal andexpect an answer right away.''</TEXT></DOC>
