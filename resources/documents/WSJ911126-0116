EC finance ministers resolved most differences over theissue, although British officials said their government stillhas reservations.   EC Economics Affairs Commissioner Henning Christophersensaid only one nation, identified by other officials asGreece, was holding out against a compromise mapped out bythe Netherlands, which currently holds the EC presidency.   British officials said their chancellor of the exchequerargued against the idea of penalties.                                                                                                          ASIAN MANAGERS' SALARY GAINS                                                                                                          Managers in many Asian countries are expected to makemajor salary gains in real terms next year, unlike their U.S.counterparts, said a study by William M. Mercer Inc. Theplanned 1992 salary increases will keep managers in HongKong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand well ahead ofexpected consumer-price increases, the New York-basedconsulting firm said. For example, salaries in Hong Kong areseen growing 13.5%, compared with an 11% inflation rate. Bycontrast, U.S. managers will be hard-pressed to stay ahead ofrising prices: Their typical salary raise is projected atabout 5% and the inflation rate at about 4%.                                                                                                          CAMBODIA'S NEW EXCHANGE RATE                                                                                                          Cambodia's central bank lowered the dollar's officialvalue against the Cambodian currency by 20% in reaction tothe dollar's plunge on the black market. The rate was set at800 riel to the dollar, down from 1,000 riel. A National Bankof Cambodia official said the bank is looking into thereasons for the dollar's 24-hour tumble on the black marketto a low of 600 riel Sunday from 1,030 riel Saturday.Speculation about reasons for the drop ranged from themassive amounts of U.S. currency brought in by foreignjournalists, United Nations peacekeeping personnel andtourists, to manipulation by powerful ethnic Chinesebusinessmen who daily set the rate.                                                                                                          OBSERVERS FOR NIGERIA CENSUS                                                                                                          Nigeria, determined to give this week's population censusinternational credibility, invited U.N. experts to act asobservers. The world's most populous black nation, with apopulation officially estimated at 120 million, still usesthe 1963 census figure of 56.7 million for planning. Theresult of the last census in 1973 was canceled because offraud. The 1991 census is a major step in a plan by thepresident, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, for a transition to civilrule.                                                                                                          CHUNNEL CUSTOMS PACT SIGNED                                                                                                          France and Britain signed a treaty spelling outborder-control procedures for the undersea Channel Tunnel, orChunnel, once it opens to rail traffic in 1993. The accordallows both countries to set up customs checkpoints at eachend of the tunnel. Controls are to be carried out in thecountries of origin. Customs agents from each country willalso have the right to carry out checks while the train ismoving on the other nation's territory.                                                                                                          THAI ASSEMBLY'S MOVE                                                                                                          Thailand's National Legislative Assembly revised a draftconstitution to reduce the proposed powers of the Senate,whose members are appointed by the ruling military junta. Thevote appeared to be a response to criticism that the proposedcharter is designed to perpetuate military rule through theSenate. The Assembly deleted sections giving senators theright to vote for the prime minister, on the budget and onnational security matters. The Senate would remain anappointed body with more power than under the previousconstitution.                                                                                                          HIGH-DEFINITION TV IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Japan Broadcasting Corp., known as NHK, launched a dailyeight-hour test program of high-definition telecasts.   The present Japanese model more than doubles the number ofscanning lines to 1125 on HDTV sets from 525 on conventionalTV sets. The U.S. and Europe are moving toward setting adifferent standard HDTV format. HDTV transmits pictures thatare as clear as images on 35-millimeter film, and digitalsound quality comparable to compact disks.   However, high costs are likely to limit the spread of HDTVin Japan for a while. HDTV sets sell for at least 3.5 millionyen ($27,000), compared with less than 100,000 yen forconventional sets.   The first broadcast was conducted by the Hi-VisionPromotion Association, made up of 126 companies headed byNHK. Last year, NHK began providing one-hour daily HDTVbroadcasts.
