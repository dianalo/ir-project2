Investigators from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency andstaffs of Senate and House members have complained of heavy secrecyby the Energy Department, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.   ``The problem with these people (at the Energy Department) ... isthat they think Harry Truman is still president and the Cold War isstill going on,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified Senate staffmember as saying.   The newspaper cited several examples of difficultiesinvestigators claim to have encountered.   _The Energy Department told federal and state EPA investigatorsthat documents they requested cannot be obtained, but then providedcopies of those documents to Cincinnati lawyers suing the plant'sformer operator, NLO Inc., for $300 million.   ``I've never seen a situation like this,'' said Stan Chesley,lead attorney in the suit on behalf of people who live and workwithin a five-mile radius of the plant.   ``I assumed, naively, that every governmental agency cooperateswith every other governmental agency. They're so used to hidingbehind clouds of secrecy that they can't seem to come into the '80sand get the problems resolved.''   _Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, an outspoken critic of Fernald, wastold by the Energy Department that the federal EPA had withdrawn itsinspectors from the plant before telling the company now undercontract to operate the plant, Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio,that it had done so.   _The Energy Department filed court papers last fall saying it hadignored and underfunded pollution control at Fernald but did nottell Westinghouse. Company spokesmen learned of the controversialfiling, which provoked widespread outrage and a congressionalhearing, in conversation with a reporter, the Enquirer reported.   Westinghouse, which is supervising cleanup, said it finds itscredibility dented when it is asked to comment on revelations it hasnot heard about.   The Energy Department denies secrecy over the plant is a problem.   ``In an organization as big as DOE, there's always an opportunityto improve communications, but there's nothing deliberate goingon,'' said spokesman Steve Wyatt at the agency's Oak Ridge, Tenn.,operations office, which oversees Fernald.   Critics say the Energy Department's resistance to sharinginformation ranges from embarrassing to dangerous. Cleanup cannotstart until the agencies accurately account for radioactive andchemical waste at the plant.   The federal Centers for Disease Control is awaiting a completeaccounting of radioactive emissions from the plant during its38-year history so it can begin its study of possible health effectson workers and neighbors of the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
