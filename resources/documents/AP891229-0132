Those already established are expected to attract large numbersof new members as people take advantage of the right to joinpolitical parties denied by Communists for 41 years.   The parties:   _ Communist Party. After four decades of a virtual monopoly onpower, enshrined in Czechoslovakia's Constitution, the Communistsare by far the best organized. However, the party is on the vergeof bankruptcy and has lost more than 66,000 of its 1.7 millionmembers since the peaceful revolution began in mid-November.   During the decades of Communist control, only four smallpolitical parties survived, the Socialist Party, the People's Partyand two parties in Slovakia considered relics of Czechoslovakia'sprewar democracy.   All of them recognized Communist rule in their statutes andcooperated with the Party.   Within the party is a potential splinter group, the DemocraticForum of Communists. This group of reform-minded party members isorganizing nationally and has threatened to leave the party at itsforthcoming congress in May 199O.   Such a break would further reduce the Communist Party's alreadygreatly diminished political influence.   _ The Socialist Party evolved from the Czech Socialist Partyafter the Communist takeover in 1948. It has 18 deputies in the350-member parliament, and publishes the widely read daily SvobodneSlovo.   Two of the new government ministers are Socialists.   Membership in the Socialist Party has stagnated at about 16,000but in the current political landscape the party is expected toattract new members.   _ The People's Party traditionally attracts Catholics and otherreligious Czechoslovaks. It has 47,000 members and holds 19 seatsin parliament.   Two members of the new cabinet are members of the People's Party.   Before the revolution, both the Socialists and the People'sParty were docile partners of the Communists with membership quotaskeeping them out of real competition.   But they are emerging as viable contenders for the upcomingelections, distancing themselves from the Communists and sidingwith the democratic opposition. The People's Party was the party topropose Havel for president in parliament.   It is difficult to estimate membership in the smaller politicalparties and groups, as the political terrain shifts with newparties emerging daily. It is unlikely that any will be able toorganize and attract a large number of members before the firstelections.   Among the smaller parties are:   _ The Czechoslovak Social-Democratic Party.   _ Czechoslovak Democratic Initiative.   _ The Green Party.   _ The Czechoslovak Agricultural Party.   _ The Christian Democratic Party.   _ The Trend for the Third Millenium.   _ The Permanent Opposition for Democracy.   _ The Party of Free Democrats, created Friday.   The strongest political force in the country, however, is not apolitical party.   Civic Forum, founded by former dissident and new PresidentVaclav Havel, is an association of former dissidents, intellectualsand democratic reformers.   Havel has said that anyone who feels like a member of CivicForum is one and that after free elections are held there will beno more need for the group.   Finally, illustrating that these days anyone can form a party,The Party of Mild Progress Within the Constraints of the Law wasrevived by Jaroslav Hasek, author of ``Good Soldier Schweik''.</TEXT></DOC>
