Until the breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the seven regional Bell companies belonged to one big, happy monopoly. Now, after being on their own for four years, they complain of too many constraints and are stirring up trouble.    They invade one another's territories to sell everything from car phones to Yellow Pages. Hoping to shield profits or gain tactical advantage, they often bend rules and sometimes break them. Some Bell salesmen tell customers that optional services are required. Most Bells look constantly for ways to undercut their rivals' efforts. They often disparage one another's integrity and even tattle on one another.    &quot;Relationships have broken down,&quot; a Washington-based industry consultant says. &quot;People aren't talking to each other.&quot; Some Bell executives who were friends before the breakup, he adds, &quot;can't stand to be in the same room with each other.&quot;    The discord is largely traceable to terms of the breakup order, which permitted ATandamp;T to engage in unregulated businesses in exchange for spinning off its 22 local Bell companies. The Bells, grouped into seven regional companies, were permitted to supply local phone service in their regions, sell telephone equipment and publish Yellow Pages. They were banned, however, from manufacturing equipment, entering the long-distance market and providing information services.    But many areas, such as the definition of information services and the prohibition on manfacturing, are murky. So the Bells have been testing the order's limits.    Much of their resentment is directed at federal Judge Harold Greene, who has been functioning as chief overseer of the breakup accord. The companies view him as an unwelcome surrogate parent.    &quot;The frustration level is very high right now,&quot; acknowledges Ronald F. Stowe, a Pacific Telesis Group vice president. Robert A. Dickemper, a strategic planner for Southwestern Bell, says all seven companies &quot;have their hands tied behind their backs.&quot; And Thomas E. Bolger, Bell Atlantic's chairman, comments, &quot;Not being able to manufacture puts a lot of pressure on us. What it does, to be brutally frank, is put us technologically in the grasp of ATandamp;T.&quot;    In September, Judge Greene ruled that the Bells may &quot;transmit&quot; various information services but can't originate the data themselves. On Monday, he defined the field rather broadly -- ruling that the Bells may convey such services as electronic mail, voice-message services, videotex, audiotex, and even a service that lets dissimilar computers talk to one another. But he maintained his ban on letting the companies originate the data, and he explicitly ruled out electronic Yellow Pages.    Though praising the judge's latest decision as a favorable step, the Bells still criticized him for keeping the restriction on generating data. Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber who worked for ATandamp;T before the breakup, describes the Bells as &quot;seething&quot; because they are &quot;multibillion-dollar companies that aren't allowed to do anything.&quot;    The acrimony has been escalating. Three separate investigations, by a federal grand jury, the Senate Government Affairs Committee and the General Services Administration's inspector general, are seeking to determine whether three of the Bells cheated to obtain government contracts. ATandamp;T set off the investigations by complaining that the GSA, the agency responsible for awarding the contracts, leaked confidential information. The GSA began investigating whether S.L. Soni, one of its managers, improperly accepted meals from the Bells and revealed to them ATandamp;T's bid-information that allegedly enabled the Bells to adjust their own bids.    The dispute has turned into a nasty family feud. ATandamp;T keeps stoking the investigations by supplying information unfavorable to the Bells. Bell Atlantic, which is under scrutiny along with BellSouth and US West, has retaliated by spreading damaging material about ATandamp;T. Meanwhile, federal investigators say, other Bell officials have been ratting on one another during interrogation.    &quot;It's vicious,&quot; one investigator says. A longtime industry consultant calls it &quot;all-out warfare.&quot;    Too much warfare could inflict lasting damage. Laird Walker, vice president for federal relations at US West, worries that the contract investigations may raise more concern about the Bell companies' behavior. He hopes that the allegations &quot;won't be confused with policy questions.&quot;    In the contract dispute, the stakes are high. Though the telephone switches themselves are worth a total only of $55 million over 30 months, they are the appetizer for a multibillion-dollar feast, the FTS-2000 project to replace the government's outdated telephone network. At present, ATandamp;T is the sole provider.    The GSA's Mr. Soni has denied any wrongdoing but declines further comment. Bell Atlantic and US West also proclaim their innocence. BellSouth won a contract for two switches but said since the investigation started that it will give it up; the company cited &quot;business reasons.&quot;    Though calling the accusation &quot;an injustice,&quot; Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's president, adds, &quot;If nothing else, this unfortunate situation has made it clear to the world that the Bells and ATandamp;T are competitors.&quot; And some outside observers view that competition as a healthy sign that divestiture is working. &quot;The more I see ATandamp;T and the Bells fighting, the more confidence I have in the breakup and the free market,&quot; says Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America.    The Bells' squabbling isn't confined to federal contracts; it spreads across almost every front. Bell Atlantic's new slogan for car phones proclaims, &quot;Business is war . . . choose your weapon.&quot; US West admonishes its sales force, &quot;Never say 'No.'&quot; Bell South touts itself as &quot;No. 1.&quot;    Timothy M. Connolly, the chief of Bell Atlantic's Mobile Systems unit, says his &quot;army&quot; confronts Southwestern Bell, which owns the other cellular license in Washington, &quot;head to head. We go after each other's accounts. We make sales calls every day to protect our own accounts.&quot; He adds: &quot;Every morning you get up and it's You and Him. We know each other's styles and weaknesses. It's like John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors.&quot;    The Bells' zeal has caught the eye of public-utility commissions.    In New York, Nynex's New York Telephone unit is under investigation for contracts with two other Nynex subsidiaries. Regulators question whether phone rates are subsidizing other services, and the state commission says it doubts that those arrangements &quot;serve the public interest.&quot;    In California, Pacific Telesis Group must refund $35.6 million to customers who were victims of an overly aggressive marketing campaign for optional telephone services, such as call waiting and speed dialing. Company salesmen had represented the options as required services.    In Pennsylvania, a Bell Atlantic unit recently offered to spend $100 million for economic development, a priority of Gov. Robert Casey, in return for deregulation. But when the plan became public, it stirred up so much controversy that Bell Atlantic dropped it.    Sometimes, the Bells are obstinate. &quot;The Bells don't yet know the meaning of the word 'no,'&quot; says Page Montgomery, vice president of Economics andamp; Technology Inc., a Boston-based consulting firm.    Charles F. Rule, who heads the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, cites a recent US West case. When the department told US West that a service it was offering was illegal, US West didn't drop it, he says. And when the court rejected the company's request for a temporary waiver, Mr. Rule says the company still didn't drop it completely. After weighing criminal charges, the department -- which complains that it is spending much more time these days enforcing the breakup accord -- worked out with US West a civil consent agreement barring the service.    Meanwhile, MCI Communications Corp. complains frequently that the Bells aren't providing equal access for long-distance carriers, as stipulated by the breakup agreement. The accord requires the Bells to update their central offices, the facilities where long-distance calls are switched, to accommodate all carriers without forcing customers to punch the extra five-digit access codes.    Says Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI's president: &quot;Nothing has come without our being as aggressive, obnoxious, any word you can think of, to get the Bell operating companies&quot; to comply with the court's order.    Much of the Bells' tactical maneuvering is aimed at Judge Greene, in an effort to get him to lift or ease the bans on various business activities. But although he has allowed some limited entries, he has generally said no. His refusal has sparked some of the sharpest attacks from the Bells and the biggest conflicts with their rivals, who endorse most of the restrictions.    Because the Bells have become so competitive with one another, they don't present a united front to Judge Greene. Company representatives have been meeting twice a month since last fall, trying to work out a consensus for congressional legislation that would circumvent him. But progress has been impeded by the Bells' mutual suspicions and differing agendas.    ATandamp;T and the Bells stand to lose a lot from a falling out. After all, the Bells are ATandamp;T's biggest customers. Analysts estimate that, together, the Bells in 1986 contributed about $5 billion of ATandamp;T's $6.2 billion of phone-equipment sales. ATandamp;T, in turn, says that in 1987 it contributed about $15.58 billion, approximately 25% of the seven Bells' total revenues, for local-access charges and billings.    &quot;If we permit our relationship to be determined by the fact that both of us fear each other,&quot; warns Alfred C. Partoll, ATandamp;T's senior vice president, &quot;it would paralyze the industry.&quot;    ATandamp;T is worried about the harm that its persistent opposition to the Bells' deregulation efforts might do to its relationships with them. Trying to mend fences, ATandamp;T Chairman James Olson has visited the top executive of each of the seven companies to explain why ATandamp;T won't support them. &quot;We were anxious that the regional companies not be surprised,&quot; ATandamp;T's Mr. Partoll says. He adds that Mr. Olson feels &quot;strongly about doing whatever he can to improve the relationship.&quot;    But those efforts apparently haven't tempered the hostility much. At a securities analysts' meeting in Philadelphia not long ago, Bell Atlantic Chairman Bolger said: &quot;Jim Olson and I argue all the time, but it doesn't do any good. They've got a monopoly, and they love it.&quot;    ---                   Comparing Their Performance                                 CLOSING    REVENUE     NET INCOME     STOCK PRICE     EMPLOYEES  (billions)    (billions)     (dollars      (As of Dec. 31)                               per share) 1984    1987   1984   1987    1984 3/8/88   1984      1988 ATandamp;T $33.19 $33.60  $1.37 $2.04   $19.50 $28.25  365,200 303,000 Ameritech   8.35   9.54   0.99  1.19    51.17  91.50   77,514  78,510 Bell Atlantic   8.09  10.30   0.97  1.24    40.19  69.50   79,500  80,950 BellSouth   9.63  12.27   1.26  1.67    22.67  39.63   96,000  98,664 NYNEX   9.57  12.08   0.99  1.28    37.13  68.00   94,900  90,000 Pacific Telesis   7.82   9.13   0.83  0.95    17.22  28.63   76,881  71,877 Southwestern Bell   7.19   8.00   0.88  1.05    23.58  37.25   71,900  67,085 U S West   7.28   8.44   0.89  1.01    35.25  54.50   70,765  68,523</TEXT></DOC>
