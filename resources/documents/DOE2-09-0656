<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0656 </DOCNO><TEXT>Pure sensory stroke (PSS) is typically caused by a lacunar infarct locatedin the ventral-posterior (VP) thalamic nucleus contralateral to the parestheticsymptoms. The lesion is usually so small that it cannot be seen on computerizedtomography (CT), as illustrated by our case. In our moderately hypertensive,72-year-old patient with PSS, CT scanning and conventional nuclear magneticresonance imaging (NMRI) scanning using a 7-mm-thick slice on a 1.5 Teslainstrument all failed to visualize the thalamic infarct. Using the high-resolutionmode with 2-mm slice thickness it was, however, clearly seen. In addition,NMRI unexpectedly showed diffuse periventricular demyelinization as wellas three other lacunar infarcts, i.e., findings characteristic of subcorticalarteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE). This prompted psychometric testing,which revealed signs of mild (subclinical) dementia, in particular involvingvisiospatial apraxia; this pointed to decreased function of the rightparietal cortex, which was structurally intact on CT and NMRI. Singlephoton emission computerized tomography by Xenon-133 injection and byhexamethyl-propyleneamine-oxim labeled with Technetium-99m showed asymmetricdistribution of cerebral blood flow (CBF), with an 18% lower value inthe right parietal cortex compared to the left side; this indicated asymmetricdisconnection of the cortex by the SAE. Thus, the tomograms of the functionalparameter, CBF, correlated better with the deficits revealed by neuropsychologicaltesting than by CT or NMRI.</TEXT></DOC>
