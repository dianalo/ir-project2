The study released Thursday by Chris van Wyk, chief executive ofthe Bankorp banking group, also said foreign investment and tradebans have hurt blacks the most.   ``The harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them,'' hesaid, adding that 80 percent of new job-seekers are black.   ``A continuation of existing trade and financial sanctionsthroughout the 1990s would render a million more black peoplejobless and 2 million more financially destitute,'' said van Wyk,whose study was described by financial writers as the mostdefinitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctions.   The study said sanctions and the pullout of foreign investmentsince 1985 cost $16 billion in foreign exchange, resulting inproduction losses of about $32 billion and total spending loss ofabout $45 billion, based on the average value of the country'scurrency, the rand, during that period.   Sanctions have impaired South Africa's ability to reach its fullexport potential and had ``radicalized many young blacks to theleft and many white voters to the right,'' Van Wyk said. ``Themoderate center has been weakened, making a political settlementmuch more difficult.''   Despite the sanctions, South Africa's economy still isconsidered the strongest and most diversified on the continent.   Van Wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to whatSouth Africa would have experienced had the price of gold, itsmajor export, averaged $200 an ounce instead of $400 over the pastfive years.   Interest rates and inflation have been higher, the rand weaker,wages lower, and growth, employment and spending levels much lowerthan they would have been without sanctions, he said.   There were some ``positive spinoffs'' from sanctions, he said.``Economic considerations began to assume their rightful place ingovernment decision-making, along with ... commitment to conceptssuch as tax reform and privatization.''   Since 1985, several hundred foreign companies have pulled out ofSouth Africa, generally citing either financial concerns orpressure from anti-apartheid groups.   In the same period, most Western countries have imposed sometype of trade sanctions on South Africa, affecting exports of majorproducts such as coal and steel even though some new markets havebeen found in the Far East.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
