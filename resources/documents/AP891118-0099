In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi lateFriday, the Tigre People's Liberation Front said its fighters tookthe town of Meranya Thursday and repulsed troops counterattackingsouthward from Desse, the capital of Wollo Province.   The rebel claims could not be independently verified. Thegovernment, in its own communique Friday, made no mention offighting around Meranya.   However, the official Ethiopian news agency said governmentforces ``repulsed recently an offensive by the TPLF against Dessefrom all fronts.''   The government has rarely commented on the Tigrean offensive,which began in late August when the insurgents pushed southward outof Tigre into Wollo and neighboring Gonder provinces.   If true, the front's claim means its forces have moved southwardpast Desse, a heavily armed government garrison that they wereunable to capture in heavy fighting last month. Desse controls avital junction on the road from Addis Ababa to Assab, one of onlytwo Ethiopian ports on the Red Sea.   The government and the rebel front met in Rome last week for thefirst time in their 14-year-old conflict, but neither side hascommented on what were described as preliminary peace talks.   The government is scheduled to meet in Nairobi on Monday withrepresentatives of another major insurgency, the Eritrean People'sLiberation Front.   The Eritreans have been fighting since 1961 for secession.   The Tigreans say they want to replace Ethiopia's Marxist regimewith a democratic government, although the Tigrean rebel leadershipitself is considered Marxist.</TEXT></DOC>
