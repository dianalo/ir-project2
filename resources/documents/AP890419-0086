Residents blamed the outbreak on price increases mandated by theInternational Monetary Fund. King Hussein, in Washington for ameeting with President Bush, told reporters ``everything is undercontrol.''   He said the disturbances were the result of the austeritymeasures.   At least 18 people were reported injured in the rioting thatbroke out Tuesday in Ma`an, a city of 25,000 about 120 miles southof Amman, and spread to other towns along the highways linking thecapital with the Red Sea port of Aqaba. The violence continuedTuesday night, but police and soldiers moved into the region todayand restored order with a curfew in Ma`an.   On Tuesday, thousands of rioters in the city attacked banks,burned tires, smashed cars and battled police. Minor demonstrationswere reported today in the city of Kerak and at the University ofJordan in Amman.   In the capital, Crown Prince Hassan told foreign reporters atthe palace that six civilians and 12 policemen were wounded Tuesdayin Ma`an.   The crown prince, King Hussein's brother, is acting head ofstate while Hussein is visiting Washington.   Yousef al-Azem, who represented Ma`an in Jordan's now-suspendedParliament, said from Amman that about 25 people were wounded.   The crown prince indicated there had been some arrests but gaveno number.   Tanks, armored vehicles and police cars were parked every fewmiles along the important north-south Desert Highway leading toMa`an. At several checkpoints, police stopped all vehicles toquestion drivers.   On Tuesday, protesters blocked the highway north of Ma`an atseveral spots with piles of rocks.   ``Civilians here have called it Jordan's intefadeh of prices,''said a security officer in Ma`an, using the Arab term for thePalestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip.   However, the crown prince suggested the riots were a product of``extremist exploitation.'' He identified the instigators as ``someof the bearded gentlemen'' _ an apparent reference to Moslemfundamentalists _ who are ``very influential over the groups in thestreet.''   Demonstrators said the protests were triggered by a governmentannouncement Sunday that prices of gasoline, vehicle fees,telephone calls and other items would rise by 10 percent to 50percent immediately.   The increases are part of an economic accord with the IMF torestructure the country's $6 billion foreign debt.   Last month, similar IMF-mandated price increases in Venezuelaled to rioting in Caracas and its slums that left at least 300people dead.   ``The main reason for this rioting is because of the priceincreases,'' said a hotel worker in Ma`an. ``The government hadbetter believe that we are starving. The people of the south arestarving.''   The price increases followed months of deteriorating economicconditions caused by a foreign exchange crisis that last yearforced the government of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai to devalue thecurrency.   The price increases are part of a government effort to trimspending.   Gasoline prices rose by 25 percent to $1.65 a gallon, and thecost of cigarettes jumped more than 40 percent to $1.57 a pack.Cooking gas, alcoholic beverages and telephone service also rose.   Some workers make as little as $93 a month, although wages of$185 to $370 are more common. Many Jordanian families have six to10 children.</TEXT></DOC>
