Algerian Oil Minister Belkacem Nabi said agreement was &quot;very close&quot; as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended its fourth day of talks in the Swiss city. Meetings will resume today.    But trading was nervous amid contradictory statements by several oil ministers. At one point, United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba said the group had reached an agreement on output cuts. That sent prices soaring to the day's high of $16.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Venezuelan Oil Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti later denied that statement, and prices eased for the rest of the day.    Nevertheless, most traders remain optimistic that an accord will be reached. &quot;It's not a question of if or when, it's a question of how long&quot; any agreement would last, said Eric Bolling, energy broker in Boston for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    Crude oil prices for January delivery on the New York Merc closed at $16.36 a barrel, up 26 cents. The February crude contract, the most active month, rose 29 cents to $16.58 a barrel.    Prices also jumped on the spot, or noncontract, market. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was $16.10 a barrel, up 25 cents. And the December price for North Sea Brent, a major European benchmark, was $15.90 a barrel, up 55 cents, in late trading.    In an unusual development, the weakest link in the energy sector was heating oil, which usually gives the market strength at this time of year. The January contract at the Merc, for example, rose only 0.11 cent a gallon, to 46.44 cents.    James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago, said one reason is that heating oil is currently at a four to five cent premium over gasoil, the European equivalent of heating oil. That spread typically is two or three cents, traders said. Moreover, they noted, the cold weather in the Northeastern U.S. that propped up prices last week has eased.    Nevertheless, the oil market's rally bolstered precious metals prices, brokers and analysts said. The metals' morning highs &quot;were strictly related to OPEC optimism,&quot; one trader in New York said. Oil prices are a barometer of inflation, and many traders hold precious metals as an inflation hedge.    But weakening energy prices late in the session and a stronger U.S. dollar &quot;helped put a crimp in the rally,&quot; the trader said. Besides, the trader said, even if OPEC cuts production about 7% as expected, &quot;that's still not all that inflationary.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold prices for December delivery rose $2.70 an ounce to $395.50; December silver prices gained 8.2 cents to $5.486 an ounce. Meanwhile, platinum contracts for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $9 an ounce to $493.70.    Some traders look for further gains in both oil and metals in the coming days. Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding, continues to rise on the oil market, indicating fresh buying. &quot;And you're going to see a lot of commodity funds getting into the long (buying) side of the market&quot; as prices increase, one trader said. Commodity funds are pools of money managed by professionals and offering limited partnership units to investors.    Chart-oriented technical traders are optimistic, too. &quot;Part of the impetus of the oil market has been its technical strength,&quot; said Chris McCormack, energy broker for E.D.andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc., New York. If crude oil prices penetrate the $16.50 to $17 level, &quot;they'll easily break $18,&quot; he said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices are expected to stabilize today after yesterday's Agriculture Department report on cattle on feedlots in seven states. The report, released after the market closed, said that as of Dec. 1, placements were up 3% from a year earlier, marketings were up 5%, and the number of cattle on feedlots was down 1%. Analysts are viewing the report as favorable, particularly the marketing figures, where the increase exceeded some forecasts. Cattle prices were down as traders evened up positions before the release of the report and responded to news of a lockout at IBP Inc.'s Dakota City, Neb., meat-packing plant. Pork-belly and hog futures were lower because of weak cash prices and slack demand for pork products, analysts said.    SUGAR: Futures prices eased as traders awaited the announcement of U.S. raw-sugar import quotas for 1987. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department announced quotas totaling slightly more than one million tons for the calendar year, down from 1,850,000 tons during the current season, which ran 13 months because of a quota extension. Some decline had been expected, as U.S. sugar production has risen and consumption declined in the past year. But the decline announced yesterday was well beyond the trade's expectations, Tom Oxnard, broker for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said. U.S. production during the global sugar season that began Sept. 1 is expected to be 5.8 million tons, up from 5,470,000 tons in 1985-86, the Agriculture Department said. Meanwhile, consumption has dropped. In the season ended Aug. 31, it was 7,120,000 tons, down from 7,350,000 the previous season.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Most corn futures prices rose slightly amid talk that Egypt may soon buy U.S. corn. But heavy farmer selling in the eastern Corn Belt over the weekend weighed on corn futures for December delivery, Susan Hackmann of Agri Analysis, Chicago, said. Wheat futures also rose slightly, reflecting continuing tight supplies of high-quality soft red winter wheat. Soybean futures closed mixed. </TEXT></DOC>
