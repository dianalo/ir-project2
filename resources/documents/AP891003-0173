KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top State Department official said Tuesdaythat sanctions against South Africa, which the Reaganadministration had opposed had ``played a role'' in moderating theapartheid policies of that nation's government.   The official also left open the possibility of further U.S.economic sanctions against the white-ruled government, an optionthe Reagan administration refused even to consider.   ``Sanctions have played a role in stimulating new thinkingwithin the white power structure,'' said Herman J. Cohen, assistantsecretary of State for Aftican affairs, in an admission never madeby officials of the previous administration.   ``It is now increasingly clear to that government that the wellbeing of the white minority cannot be sustained without anegotiated political settlement that results in political equalityfor all South Africans,'' Cohen said.   ``I cannot imagine your predecessor (in the Reaganadministration) making that statement,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcomittee onAfrica, applauding the formulation as `` a shift in position.''   Cohen said that while he wouldn't characterize the Bushadministration's position as a change, the White House doesrecognize that without positive steps to dismantle South Africa'ssystem of racial apartheid, ``pressures will build for moresanctions.''   It becomes clear, he said, ``that we cannot wait indefinitely.''   However, Cohen discouraged calls for stiffer measures, sayingthe administration by far prefers a course of negotiations, notpunitive sanctions.   Cohen's testimony coincided with the State Department's releaseof a congressionally mandated report to determine the impact ofsanctions imposed by the United States in 1986 and to evaluatewhether additional measures are necessary.   While asserting that the 1986 sanctions have not succeeded inabolishing apartheid, the report said ``there is some reason forhope that the opportunity for a peaceful end to apartheid has notyet been lost.''   The study said ``further sanctions are not needed at this timeand would be counterproductive in view of steps being taken withinSouth Africa and the region to bring about change through peacefulmeans.''   The report concluded additional sanctions mandated by Congress``have not to date been successful in moving the South Africangovernment toward the goals ... that are shared by theadministration and Congress.''   Cohen said the administration is committed to effectivelyenforcing the existing sanctions ``in the hope and expectation thatpositive signs of a commitment to change will appear in the nearfuture.''   Cohen's appearance represented the first administrationtestimony on South Africa since the inauguration of the governmentof President F. W. de Klerk who campaigned for the office on amoderate platform.   ``For the first time in years it is possible to be somewhathopeful that a negotiation scenario may be just beyond thehorizon,'' Cohen said, adding that South Africa appears to beentering a period of ``talking about talks.''   External and internal pressures are helping convince the SouthAfrican government that it must ``move beyond its current positionand accept fundamental change,'' he said.   ``In fact, the new de Klerk government has indicated it isprepared to take concrete steps to address this need.''   ``For this reason, the administration recommends that no newsanctions be considered at the present time,'' he said.   During the Reagan administration the Democratic majority inCongress engaged in fierce battles with the White House over SouthAfrican policy, battles which resulted in the passage ofcomprehensive economic sanctions in 1986.   Cohen said that South Africa was quickly identified by Secretaryof State James A. Baker III ``as an area where the breakdown ofbipartisan support undercut the ability of the United States toencourage a peaceful transition to democracy.''   ``We want to be able to send a a clear signal of broad,bipartisan support for a policy premised on unequivocal abhorrenceof apartheid, reflected in a sustained U.S. commitment to promotingnegotiations btween the government of in Pretoria and legitimateblack representatives leading to a non-racial and democratic SouthAfrica,'' Cohen said.   Another witness, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., complained,however, that the Bush administration is engaged in ``unacceptablefoot dragging'' on South Africa.   ``We should make clear we are prepared to impose additional U.S. sanctions against South Africa, if there is no progress,''Kennedy said, suggesting that leverage might be found innegotiations set for next year to restructured $9 billion in SouthAfrican debt to U.S. banks.</TEXT></DOC>
