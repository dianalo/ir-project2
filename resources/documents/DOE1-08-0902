The grate is positivelyself-cleaning, non-sifting and fuel burns undisturbed, requiring no rakingor slicing. A wide range of cheap industrial fuels can be burned smokelesslyat high efficiency without constant expert attention. The use of automationallied to efficient fuel and ash handling systems can now reduce degreeof labour and attendance which is required for a chain grate stoker.The possibilities for fully automatic control of a chain grate stokerare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
