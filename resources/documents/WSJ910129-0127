The companies said they will examine applications of thenew technologies to see how they can meet growing demandsfrom businesses for high-speed communications. The study willinclude research on switching technologies, high-performanceinformation transmission and network management. The studycould lead to faster and more efficient ways of sending dataand video information.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Basically, our view is that the communicationsinfrastructure is evolving&quot; from relatively slow-speed linksover copper wire to high-speed connections over fiber optics,said Alan Baratz, IBM's director of high-performancecomputing and communications. The companies, he said, need tounderstand the advantages and disadvantages of the emergingtechnologies.   Chris Noll, product manager BellSouth Services marketing,said the companies plan to move the technologies out of thelaboratory soon. He said that IBM and BellSouth, the regionalBell company based in Atlanta, haven't picked theapplications yet, but that field tests would begin later thisyear. BellSouth's work will be handled through BellSouthServices, which is jointly owned by its telephone companyunits. BellSouth Services develops new products and servicesand handles strategic marketing, network planning andprocurement services.   IBM saw benefits in BellSouth's expertise in the publicnetwork. Mr. Baratz said that &quot;many different options areemerging,&quot; and IBM wants &quot;to make sure we are in a positionto exploit those that become important.&quot; Similarly, BellSouthgains IBM's computing expertise. &quot;This is an opportunity forBellSouth to work with a leader like IBM to explore the newtechnologies and applications that broadband and broadbandswitching could bring to the market,&quot; Mr. Noll said.   The base for experiments and analysis will be IBM's&quot;Paris&quot; technology, a packet-switching method fortransmitting voice, data and images. Packet switching dividesmessages into standard-size units, or packets, which are sentindividually. The Paris technology uses Synchronous OpticalNetwork links at speeds of up to 622 megabits per second, orthe equivalent of sending 14,000 single-spaced typewrittenpages per second. With new optical fiber networks and newcomputing and communications technologies, that capacitycould multiply within a few years.   The companies said that several technologies will bestudied, including Switched Multi-megabit Digital Services, ahigh-speed method of connecting local computer networks thatuses the public telephone network. The technology, developedby Bell Communications Research, is being tested by severalof the regional Bell companies.</TEXT></DOC>
