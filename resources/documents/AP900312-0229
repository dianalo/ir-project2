(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A union official said Greyhound'sstriking drivers have been ``like choirboys'' and did not fire agunshot that injured eight passengers on a bus operated by areplacement driver.   The shot, fired apparently from an Interstate 95 overpass,showered passengers on the Jacksonville-to-Daytona Beach run withglass and other debris Sunday night, said sheriff's spokesman SteveWeintraub. No arrests were made.   ``Everybody was hollering, `I'm hit, I'm hit,''' said passengerRonald Hill.   Eight of the 41 passengers were injured, but none of theinjuries appeared life-threatening, authorities said. They weretaken to hospitals, and two people underwent surgery for shrapnelwounds.   Michael Rogers of Atlanta, a passenger who was wounded in theneck and chest, was being treated at St. Luke's Hospital.   ``I don't think they (Greyhound) should run their lines whilethey're having a situation like this going on. Or at least warn thegeneral public that a situation like that might occur,'' he said.   A Greyhound bus headed into Hartford, Conn., was hit by gunfirethis morning, Connecticut state police said.   The shooting occurred on Interstate 84 in Farmington, Conn.,just west of Hartford, at about 10:45 a.m., said state policespokesman Adam Berluti.   One passenger, Dondi Maheux, 22, who was heading to Maine, saidmost passengers on the bus were asleep when the shooting occurred.``I just heard a small pop. It sounded maybe just like afirecracker going off,'' Maheux said.   Investigators at the Union Station terminal where the busarrived about 11 a.m. were talking to passengers. The bus had whatappeared to be a bullet hole on the driver's side in the baggagearea.   Greyhound was offering a $25,000 reward for information leadingto the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the Floridashooting, company Chairman Fred G. Currey said.   Currey and company President Frank Schmieder traveled today fromGreyhound's Dallas headquarters to Jacksonville, where they visitedthe hospitalized passengers and a hotel where uninjured passengersstayed overnight, company spokesman George Gravley said.   This morning, the two executives also were in the terminaltalking to passengers and planned to ride buses today fromJacksonville to Miami and Orlando, Gravley said.   The shooting came on the eve of a meeting called in Washingtonby federal mediators with officials of the striking AmalgamatedCouncil of Greyhound Local Unions in a bid to end the strike.   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000office and maintenance workers, went on strike March 2. There havebeen scattered violent incidents since, including a striker crushedto death by a bus operated by a replacement driver in Redding,Calif., and shots fired at buses in Chicago and Phoenix.   Asked if Sunday night's shooting was strike-related, Weintraubsaid, ``I think it is.''   But Bill Nicholson, an executive board member of theJacksonville local of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound LocalUnions, said, ``As far as I'm concerned it wasn't one of ourstrikers.''   ``They've been like choirboys,'' he said.   In Dallas, union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson echoed that view. ``Webelieve it's important for the public to understand that this is astrike against the company, not against the traveling public,''Nelson said.   The bus was on a highway about 10 miles south of downtownJacksonville when it was hit, Weintraub said. A newly hiredreplacement driver was at the wheel, Greyhound said.   ``I yelled for everybody to get down, and I told the bus driverto put his accelerator pedal to the floor,'' said passenger KevinCovington.   The unidentified bus driver pulled the bus in safely at aconvenience store about two miles away. The store's night manager,Roger Ennis, said passengers covered in blood ran in and told himto call 911.   Earlier Sunday, Greyhound announced it has restored bus serviceto an additional 120 communities that lost regular runs when thestrike began.   Company spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said Greyhound added routesSunday in parts of the Southeast and Southwest after a new class ofdrivers graduated from training courses. But she said she didn'tknow how many of the 9,500 communities served before the strikewere being served as of Sunday night.   On Saturday, Greyhound carried 38 percent of the number ofpassengers it did on the same Saturday a year ago and operatedone-third of the number of departing buses, Ms. Hale said. Figuresfor Sunday would reflect the larger number of routes but wereunavailable until today, she said.   Greyhound has been able to serve big cities virtually withoutinterruption since the strike began, with Sunday's additionsincluding smaller cities and towns, Ms. Hale said.</TEXT></DOC>
