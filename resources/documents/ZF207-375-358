 That vastcommunications infrastructure permits the easy exchange of information acrosscontinents and down the hall.andM;It also opens the way for a variety of threats to data security.andP;  These rangefrom viruses to malicious sabotage to the accidental trashing of a crucialcentral file.andM;That possibility has forced MIS and microcomputer managers to balance theopposing concepts of providing easy network access for greater productivityagainst the need to take ever-greater steps to ensure data integrity.andM;Fortunately, several vendors have recognized the need to help MIS handle thisbalancing act.andP;  As a result, Mac managers have access to a booming market ofproducts to ensure that information remains secure without placing unduestrain on information availability.andM;The antiseptic approach.andP;  For many people, viruses represent the latest formof computer crime.andP;  Much has been written about the issue, and concern hasreached sufficient levels to warrant the wide availability of productsdesigned to help wipe out viruses.andM;These include Virex from HJC Software, Vaccine from CE Software, Apple'sVirus Rx, AntiToxin from Mainstay, 1stAid Software's Anti-Virus Kit andSymantec Anti-Virus for Macintosh (SAM).andM;Mike Bailey, systems integrator for Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. inMountain View, Calif., said he uses Virex and Vaccine, which, he said, willfind current viruses but won't do much to protect against future problems.andO;As a result, he's also testing some products not yet on the market.andM;&quot;If you have all the vaccines available, chances are you'll detect [theviruses],&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But [vaccines] take up a lot of software overhead, andthey're only effective until the next strain comes along.&quot;andM;In fact, HJC Software offers a $75 one-year subscription service for Virexthat will help subscribers fight new strains.andM;&quot;We have updated Virex four times during past six months to handle newviruses,&quot; said Robert Capon, president of HJC.andP;  &quot;And with each update, thenormal length of time from our receiving a new virus from a subscriber to oursending out the update is five days.andP;  Subscribers receive those updated disksautomatically.&quot;andM;As a preventive measure, a number of companies have issued directivesconcerning application software downloaded from on-line bulletin boards.andM;&quot;The first thing we tell [em ployees] is to test the software with a virusdetector,&quot; said Bob Clarke, marketing director for the TOPS division of SunMicrosystems Inc. in Alameda, Calif.andP;  &quot;The first catastrophe we have, we'llprobably stop downloading from bulletin boards.&quot;andM;John Norstad, a systems analyst for Northwestern University in Evanston,Ill., wrote Disinfectant, a shareware virus detector.andP;  Norstad said hebelieves commercial  applications are just as likely to harbor viruses assoftware from bulletin boards.andM;That's why Disinfectant warns users not to trust anything, not evenshrink-wrapped products, Norstad said.andM;Of course, network administrators can't be sure that every mach-ine has beenvaccinated unless they do it themselves.andP;  One product that will ease thattask will be Version 3.0 of Farallon Computing's Timbuktu, due out thismonth.andP;  According to Tom Rielly, Farallon's director of marketing, Timbuktuwill let users transfer files without using the server as an intermediary.andO;That feature will allow the administrator to remotely run vaccinationprograms for all Timbuktu-equipped Macs.andM;Behind bars.andP;  Despite the problems viruses pose, they're far from the onlythreats to data.andP;  In fact, when it comes to data security, most industryobservers maintain that companies have more to fear from their own employees.andM;&quot;Most problems come from people inside the company innocently deleting a datafile, which can destroy a whole system,&quot; said Lou Picciano, owner of EssexSystems Inc., a New York-area consultant and member of the MacintoshConsultants Network.andM;That was true for Sean McIver, a computer systems specialist with Jennings,Kepner andamp; Hauge, a law firm in Phoenix, Ariz.andP;  Some files were accidentlydeleted by people gaining access to unprotected Macs, said McIver.andP;  To helpprevent that from happening to critical files, McIver uses the HD Partitionutility included with Symantec Utilities for Macintosh (SUM).andM;&quot;You can electronically chop  off part of your drive and put a password onit,&quot; McIver said.andP;  &quot;That way you have a section of your drive set aside withyour sensitive files, and no can get in unless they know your password.&quot;andM;Other such programs are MacSafe and NightWatch, both from Kent Marsh Ltd.,andO;and Empower from Magna.andM;Central authority.andP;  In addition to using SUM, McIver is beta testing Casady andamp;Greene's security package, A.C.E.andP;  (Access Control Environment), which isexpected to ship in July.andM;&quot;[A.C.E.] stops applications from downloading if you don't type in thecorrect password,&quot; McIver said.andM;This hard disk access manager offers multiple levels of security and viralprotection.andP;  For example, managers can use it to set up a hierarchicalstructure of users for each machine, including the server.andP;  They can alsoprevent networked users from installing applications, desk accessories,Control Panel devices (cdevs) or Startup documents (INITs) that have not beenapproved or certified as virus-free.andP;  Documents and applications can beencrypted and decrypted.andP;  Applications can be run but not copied, preventingpiracy.andM;Besides Casady andamp; Greene, other vendors have announced new data securitypackages or include security features in existing products.andM;For example, Version 2.0 of Liaison, Infosphere's software-only AppleTalkbridge, boasts several new security features, according to Eric Gould,marketing agent for the company.andM;The new release includes a dial-back capability, which permits only callersfrom an authorized number to log onto the host network.andP;  Further, Liaison canlimit access to a single node or zone or can permit access to the entirenetwork.andP;  The product also maintains a log of all attempts to dial into thenetwork.andM;Enigmatic files.andP;  Sometimes, managers responsible for computer security wanta way to make files incomprehensible to the wrong eyes.andP;  That's whenencryption enters the picture.andM;Camouflage from usrEZ Software and Sentinel from SuperMac Technology are tworecent entries in the growing data encryption market.andP;  With most suchproducts, users can choose between the federal government's Data EncryptionStandard (DES) or a faster, proprietary scheme.andM;Nasty habits.andP;  In many respects, the organizational models prescribed bysecurity products go against the democratic nature of the Mac and AppleTalk.andO;&quot;It's very difficult to build a lot of protection and security into AppleTalksystems,&quot; said Bill Silva, lead analyst with Chevron U.S.A.andP;  of Richmond,Calif.andP;  &quot;Around here, people get more work done through the user-friendlinessof the Mac than through more difficult interfaces,&quot; Silva said.andP;  &quot;As soon asyou start building layers of protection onto the Mac, you start doing thingsto the user interface.&quot;andM;Other administrators said that their job is made more difficult by users nottaking security seriously.andM;&quot;The hardest thing to do is to get [users] to keep and maintain passwordsecurity, even those who really care about secure documents,&quot; said JohnFarago, associate professor of law and director of law school systems at CityUniversity of New York at Queens College in Flushing, N.Y.andM;Students tell their passwords to their research associates; staffers telltheir assistants.andP;  In addition, users select easy-to-break codes, like theirchildren's names, and never change them, said Farago.andM;&quot;It doesn't make sense to put a lot of staff time into system security whenyou can't make it any more secure than that,&quot; he said.andM;In fact, several observers said that for security measures to be effective,users have to realize that they must give up certain rights when they enter anetwork.andM;According to Harry DeMaio, national manager of ProTech/Information ProtectionServices, a Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells consulting unit, companies have to goback to the basics of controlling the people with access to the system.andM;&quot;If you have several thousand people, it's likely that one or two are angryat the company,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The more access to the system, the more the oddsare stacked against you.&quot;andM;A.J.andP;  Dennis, senior micro consultant at Boston University's informationcenter, agreed.andP;  &quot;A LAN is as much of a community as a small town,&quot; saidDennis.andP;  &quot;There are rights and privileges that individuals surrender to bepart of a community, and if they don't like that, they can choose not tobelong.&quot;
