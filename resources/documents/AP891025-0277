In a news conference with foreign reporters, Aqazadeh also saidIran would seek compensation for the destruction of offshore oilplatforms by U.S. forces near the end of the Gulf war.   Aqazadeh did not give any specific growth rate predictions forworld oil demand, but contended it would ``increase substantially''over the next two years.   ``We anticipate this demand will reach such a level that theOPEC quota system will be abandoned altogether,'' Aqazadeh said.   ``As a result all members will be able to produce as much asnecessary to meet demand, and the OPEC quota system will beabandoned.''   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries now attemptsto support a price of $18 a barrel for its crude oil through asystem of voluntary production limits, or quotas, imposed on eachof its 13 members.   Prices have hovered somewhat below that level, partly becauseoverproduction by some member nations has pushed OPEC's outputabove the official ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day.   Asked how prices would be set once the quota system wasabolished, Aqazadeh said ``there will be a long-term production andprice strategy and by controlling production OPEC will be able tocontrol price.''   ``Some very serious discussion over long-term strategy is takingplace among OPEC members,'' Aqazadeh said. He gave no details onhow long-term production would be controlled without quotas.   William Veno, director of oil market analysis for Data ResourcesInc. in Boston, said demand in non-communist nations grew by 2.3percent _ about 1.2 million barrels a day _ in the first threequarters of 1989 for total daily consumption of 51.2 millionbarrels.   OPEC's average production during that time was 21 millionbarrels a day, he said.   Data Resources projects that worldwide demand growth will slowto 1.3 percent in 1990 and about 1.2 percent annually in the nextthree years.   Aqazadeh also said Iran intends to seek compensation from theUnited States for destroying Iranian offshore oil platforms duringthe Gulf war.   He did not say how much the compensation should be, but saidtotal damage to his country's offshore oil installations during theeight-year war was $1.5 billion. Most of the damage resulted fromIraqi air raids.   U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf attacked a number of Iranianoil platforms, which Iranian forces used as bases for attacks onneutral shipping.   Aqazadeh said Iran's main oil loading platform on Kharg Island,which was raided repeatedly by Iranian jets, sustained $300 millionworth of damage.   He said Iran planned to invest $8.4 billion in hard currency onpetrochemical expansion projects over the next five years. Ifspending in local currency is included, total investment in suchprojects could reach two to three times that amount, he said.   Aqazadeh said Iran now earns $12 billion annually from oil andexpects to earn $70 billion over the next five years. The currentearnings were based on a daily production of about 3 millionbarrels per day, some 2 million barrels of which are exported.   Aqazadeh said current production capacity was 3.5 millionbarrels a day, but it was not fully used, to conform to Iran'sproduction quota of 2.92 million barrels a day set by OPEC.   He said expansion and reconstruction would increase capacity to4 million barrels a day within three years, compared with pre-warcapacity of 6 million barrels.   Aqazadeh said Iran's current total refining capacity is 730,000barrels per day.</TEXT></DOC>
