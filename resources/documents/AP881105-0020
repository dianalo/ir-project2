He said some people are too quick toaccept the Soviet reforms, ``and some people are too skeptical. Wemust find a middle way.''   The debate over tactics has heated up in the last two weeksfollowing an inaugural conference in the Lithuanian capital ofVilnius of the officially sanctioned Movement for Restructuring,which takes its name from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's planof economic and social reform.   About 20,000 people gathered for the Oct. 22-23 conference, wheremore than 1,000 delegates, including many Communist Party members,adopted resolutions demanding sweeping reforms for Lithuania,already one of the most progressive of the 15 Soviet republics.   Emigres who participated in the conference said that within a fewdays, the Lithuanian party began to reduce food and medicalprivileges enjoyed by its elite members.   And last week, the newly installed party chief, AlgirdasBrazauskas, announced plans to free several prominent politicalprisoners.   Vytautas Bieliauskas, president of the Lithuanian World Communityand one of a few U.S. citizens allowed to attend the conference,said ``enthusiasm is quite high'' in Lithuania.   ``People were sitting at the television _ it was transmittingeverything from the conference _ and people were crying,'' he saidafter returning home to Cincinnati, Ohio.   Bieliauskas, whose organization says it represents a quarter ofthe world's 1 million expatriate Lithuanians, received a visa toattend the conference. But many other emigre activists were refusedpermits.   Some claim that by this move, Soviet authorities were trying todrive a wedge into the Lithuanian emigre community.   ``They (the people of Lithuania) are after independence, but theSoviets only want the economic advantage of free enterprise. Peopleexpect more freedom than they'll get,'' said Ancietas Simiutis,Lithuania's consul general-in-exile in the United States.   The Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic republics of Lithuania,Latvia and Estonia in 1940 under a secret pact with Nazi Germany.Nationalists denounced the pact, and several countries, includingthe United States, continue to recognize Baltic diplomats whomaintain offices in the West.   Simiutis is one of many nationalists who are skeptical ofGorbachev's campaign to reform the Soviet system and permit moreopenness about controversial issues.   ``We think (Bieliauskas) is doing a good job, but (he) might be abit naive because he expects more than the Soviets will give,''Simiutis said. He said the Soviets need Bieliauskas to helplegitimize their ``occupation'' and called his admission to theconference a ``Soviet trick.''   Bieliauskas responded that the Lithuanian organization'sexecutive committee voted 8-1 in favor of him attending theconference.   ``(Lithuania) is occupied by the Soviet Union, but it doesn'tmean it doesn't exist. I deal with people, not with thegovernment,'' Bieliauskas said.   Bieliauskas said independence could be possible for Lithuania.   ``But people are not ready. The process has just started. ... Ibelieve in the process, but it will take time,'' he said.   Klimaitis of the Baltic World Council said the older generationwants ``only the reconstruction of the Baltics of the 1918-1940period (when they were independent). But it looks like there areother possibilities ... more creative ideas for a new state,'' hesaid, speaking by telephone from Strasbourg, France.   Klimaitis envisioned the republics in a loose confederation withthe central government in Moscow that would have control only overmilitary and some foreign affairs.   ``I think this will be possible,'' Klimaitis said, becauseGorbachev realizes the region could become the Soviet Union's ``bigduty-free shop.''   Soviet Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev last week appearedto rule out independence for the Baltic republics by saying in apublished interview that Moscow wouldn't let the Baltic statesconduct their own foreign affairs or print their own currency.   But Bieliauskas maintains his hope for independence, pointing toa younger generation of activists in Lithuania.   Klimaitis called the youth's participation the most encouragingsign he saw.   ``They have had some days of real freedom, and they will neverforget that.''</TEXT></DOC>
