The leader of the South-West Africa People's Organization saidhis guerrilla fighters had no intention of leaving the SouthAfrican-controlled territory, a newspaper reported.   A confidential U.N. report obtained by The Associated Pressindicated that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarapproved of allowing the South African troops off their basesbefore the fighting.   The United States said it had offered an aircraft to the UnitedNations to airlift a battalion of about 850 Finnish soldiers toNamibia.   ``The U.N. has accepted the offer. We are working out thedetails with the U.N. and cannot say when the U.N. troops willarrive,'' the State Department said in a statement. U.N. andFinnish officials confirmed the statement but declined to elaborate.   Angola's news agency reported from Luanda that SWAPO hadpresented a peace plan to U.N. officials, but no details werereleased.   ``SWAPO must surrender, lay down their arms, hoist a white flag_ then nothing will happen to them,'' Foreign Affairs Minister PikBotha said in a shortwave radio broadcast beamed throughout Namibia.   If the guerrillas turn themselves in to police, ``then they willbe safely taken back'' to bases in Angola, Botha said ongovernment-run Radio South Africa.   The fighting between South African-led police and SWAPOguerrillas began Saturday, the day a U.N.-supervised independenceplan began in Namibia.   The battles continued for a fifth straight day Wednesday, andterritorial authorities said 179 guerrillas, 21 members of thesecurity forces and an undetermined number of civilians have beenkilled in the most intense combat of the 23-year war.   South Africa claims that about 1,400 guerrillas have crossedinto Namibia since Saturday in violation of an agreement that callsfor combatants on both sides to be confined to bases.   Under the U.N. plan, guerrillas were to remain at their bases inAngola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's border until mid-May.Some U.N. and other officials have suggested that SWAPO fieldcommanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolestedto Namibia as of April 1 and set up bases there.   The SWAPO leader, Sam Nujoma, claims the guerrillas have been inNamibia for some time and that the security forces instigated thefighting.   The Star of Johannesburg, reporting from Harare, Zimbabwe,quoted Nujoma as saying his forces would not withdraw to Angola.   ``If you read the (U.N.) resolution carefully it does not sayguerrilla forces who were found in Namibia on April 1 should bedriven out ... to be confined in Angola,'' Nujoma was quoted assaying.   SWAPO Secretary-General Andimba Toivo, in an interview with theAP at the United Nations in New York, said: ``Our forces are notgoing to be withdrawn. They will remain in Namibia, which is ourcountry.''   South Africa has threatened to scrap plans for grantingindependence to the territory unless the United Nations takesstrong steps to resolve the crisis.   Louis Pienaar, the South African-appointed administrator-generalof Namibia, said if the guerrillas did not surrender by Saturday,police will pursue them ``with all the means at their disposal.''   If guerrillas were seen heading north toward Angola they ``willnot be pursued aggressively,'' Pienaar added.   Cedric Thornberry, a senior official of the U.N. peacekeepingcontingent in Namibia, said efforts to establish a truce ``arebeing advanced with critical urgency, because we are now facing adeteriorating situation in the north.''   He said the United Nations was giving ``active consideration''to advancing the arrival of the rest of its planned 4,650-membermilitary monitoring force. Only 921 members of the force are now inNamibia. The remaining troops, including those from Finland, are toarrive by the end of the month.   The United Nations has declined to state publicly how and whySouth African troops engaged the guerrillas and who gave the order.U.N. officials say that is confidential information.   Toivo said Perez de Cuellar denied in a meeting on Tuesday nightthat U.N. officials had authorized the move.   A copy of a confidential report Perez de Cuellar issued Mondaynight in New York, however, cites reports of a mass incursion bySWAPO and says:   ``In all these circumstances and upon the urgent and jointrecommendation of my special representative and the (peacekeeping)force commander, I authorized them (the U.N. officials) to accept astrictly limited and temporary suspension of the requirement forsome units of the South African military to be confined to base.''   SWAPO, which gets most of its military assistance from the Eastbloc, has battled South African rule since 1966 and has beenfavored to win the most votes in pre-independence elections plannedfor November under the U.N. plan.   However, Botha, in a letter to Perez de Cuellar, said Tuesdaythat ``unless active and effective measures are taken within thenext few hours ... the whole peace process in Namibia is in dangerof collapse.''   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling forwithdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have helped Marxist Angolabattle U.S.-backed rebels.   Namibia, which has 1.3 million people, is roughly the size ofFrance and West Germany combined. The predominantly blackpopulation includes about 75,000 whites.</TEXT></DOC>
