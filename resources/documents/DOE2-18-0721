This was achieved by raising the corefrom the original height of 75 cm to 100 cm. Basic neutron-physics characteristicswere measured during the process of bringing the BN-600 reactor up tothe new core position. This change in the core position caused a shiftin the effects and calibration characteristics of the control rods. Thework made in 1986 also included observation and analysis of the outputdistribution in fuel assemblies installed around the core of the BN-350reactor in an effort to increase the reliability of performance predictionof the side blanket and in-pile storage container. For the BFS-2 cariticalassembly, a study is made with a model of BN-800 which is axially heterogeneous.Criticality parameters were determined and the distribution of fissionrate in the direction of the length and radius of the core was measured.Another study was m-de to improve the procedures for determine the valueof the group constant required for the calculation of the reactivitycoefficient.
