Savers may withdraw about $600 from the frozen accounts onAug. 15, and any balances will be parceled out in 12 monthlyinstallments. Brazil doesn't expect consumption and inflationto rise as a result, as only about $900 million will returnimmediately to circulation.   But inflation rose a preliminary 13% in July and 10% inJune. It topped 84% in March 1990 when the 18-month freezewas imposed on $115 billion in private and corporate bankaccounts. Most of the cash returned to circulation throughloopholes and special cases, such as tax payments.   In Colombia, rebel sabotage against petroleuminstallations, electricity towers, transport vehicles andother infrastructure has cost the nation's economy $490million this year, the army said. Guerrillas have targetedthe economy to protest alleged military abuses and improvetheir position in peace talks.                                                                                                          ROMANIANS TO BE SHAREHOLDERS                                                                                                          Legislation to put 30% of Romania's industry into privatehands won Senate passage, despite a walkout by theopposition, which favored 50%. The bill was sent to thepresident to be signed into law. Under the legislation, thestate will control 70% of state-owned enterprises and equalshares of the remainder will be distibuted free to allRomanians over 18 years old. Five holding companies will beestablished to manage the privatizations and eventually topay dividends.                                                                                                          BRITAIN'S RAIL INVESTMENT PLAN                                                                                                          State-operated British Rail plans to invest more than #1billion ($1.68 billion) annually in its rail network throughthe end of the century. The 10-year plan, called Future Rail,splits investment equally between existing and new systems.Major projects include a new line for international travelersusing the English Channel tunnel that will link Britain andFrance, and redevelopment of Kings Cross station in London tomove passengers to other points in Britain.                                                                                                          TAIWAN TO BOOST Randamp;D OUTLAYS                                                                                                          Taiwan plans to increase its research and developmentspending to 2.5% of gross national product by the year 2000from 1.64% now, the government's National Science Councilsaid. The plan, which aims to help improve businesscompetitiveness, requires a total outlay of 300 billion NewTaiwan dollars (US$11.1 billion) through 1996; a larger,unspecified sum is anticipated for 1997 through 2000. Theprivate sector incurs 52% of overall Randamp;D expenses andgovernment provides the balance. Taipei plans to requirebusinesses to shoulder 70% of total Randamp;D investment costs by2000.                                                                                                          NEW ZEALAND VOWS SPENDING CUTS                                                                                                          The conservative National Party government issued aspending plan aimed at reducing the budget deficit. Its firstplan since its election last October continues the drasticrestructuring of New Zealand's welfare system begun lastDecember, when jobless and welfare benefits were slashed. Thebudget projects a deficit, before government asset sales, of1.74 billion New Zealand dollars (US$992.7 million) in theyear ending June 30, narrowing from a year-earlier gap ofNZ$2.86 billion. The largest saving comes from cuttingpensions by raising age eligibility.

The 15 island nations faulted France forits nuclear tests in French Polynesia, but Paris vowed tocontinue them. Low-lying island nations could becomeuninhabitable if ocean levels rise from the greenhouseeffect, they said, urging industrialized nations to increaseenergy efficiency and find new energy sources.

The industrialists' association Confindustria wants toundo the inflation indexing system that provides forautomatic pay raises. The unions, which represent about 8.5million workers in the public and private sectors, arewilling to discuss revising the system, provided workersremain protected against inflation.
