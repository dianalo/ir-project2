Under rules establishedby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a qualifying facilitymay be either a cogenerator or a small power producer, but for the purposeof this manual the focus will be on small power producers. A small powerproduction facility is a facility which produces electric energy withrenewable resources comprising at least 75% of the total fuel sourceand which is not greater than 80 megawatts in total installed capacity.Wind energy conversion devices, solar photovoltaics, hydroelectric systems,and electric generators fueled by waste or biomass are all examples ofsmall power production facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
