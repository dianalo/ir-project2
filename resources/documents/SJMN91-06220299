I musthave wandered into and out of 60 or 70 stores.;    &quot;May I help you?&quot; was notan uncommon greeting. But when I replied, &quot;I'm looking for a gift,&quot; clerksfroze. &quot;Oh no, another undecided male who doesn't know what he wants,&quot; I couldalmost hear them thinking.;    I LOOKED at clothes.;    &quot;What size is yourwife?&quot;;    &quot;What colors does she like?&quot;;    &quot;Are you looking for summer orfall wear?&quot;;    &quot;I dunno,&quot; I replied with an educated eloquence.;    &quot;Will yoube going on vacation soon and would she like something to take with her?&quot;;   &quot;I dunno.&quot;;    &quot;Does she work? Would she be interested in something in careerwear?&quot;;    &quot;I dunno.&quot; I did know that she works, but I was hung up on the&quot;career wear&quot; part.;    I looked at jewelry.;    &quot;Were you looking forpossibly earrings with precious stones?;    &quot;I dunno.&quot;;    &quot;How about a goldnecklace?&quot;;    &quot;Naw. I dunno.&quot;;    I looked at perfume. I looked at candy,fine china, housewares, linens, and lingerie and then it dawned on me. My wifehas been saying for some time now that she wanted a pair of really nicelicense plate frames for our car.;    THAT'S IT! I beamed, internally, ofcourse so as to not embarrass myself and headed to Cupertino to a place thatsells fancy license plate frames and bought a pair.;    But I needed somethingelse. Something more personal. Something that said, &quot;You're not growing older;the world is and you're just along for the ride,&quot; but for the life of me Icouldn't think of a single thing.;    ALL I could envision would be thedisappointment on her face when she opened a pair of license plate frames. Waydown deep I knew that she wanted them, but she wanted them in the same way shewants me to take out the garbage or pick up dry cleaning.;    Without anyfurther effort her birthday arrived. I was nervous. I perspired and I wasriddled with guilt. I was ashamed and all of this contributed to my notwrapping the frames and forgetting to sign a birthday card before I stuffed itinto an envelope.;    I handed a brown paper bag to my wife, gazed at thefloor and with the other hand slipped her the card.;    &quot;AAHHHHH!&quot; sheremarked (which would have been &quot;AAHHHHH!-aahhhhh!-aahhhhh in the center mallat Valley Fair). &quot;I've been wanting these for sometime and I'm so happy youremembered my birthday.&quot;;    &quot;What do you mean &quot;remember?&quot; I queried.;   &quot;Don't you remember? Last year you forgot and then you made up for it bysending me on a shopping spree.&quot;;    She was so sweet about the whole thingand I'm standing there thinking, &quot;Aaagh, I could have avoided all the hassleof shopping if I'd just remembered to put all my cash in with a birthday card.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Owen Whetzel column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910807  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  632  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday August 7, 199100220299,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
