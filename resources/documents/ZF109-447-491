 It is also designed for use with PC networks handlingdata-intensive applications or large numbers of users.andM;HP'S NETWORK MASS STORAGE SYSTEM TO FEATURE NLM andamp; NETWORK LIBRARIAN SOFTWAREEmerald Systems' RAMP software product line consists of EmQ, EmSAVE and EmLIBsoftware.andP;  These three software products were designed as a complete familyof backup, restore and data management tools for specific use in networkingenvironments.andM;Two of the RAMP software products -- EmQ and EmLIB -- were selected by HP foruse with the 1.3-Gbyte digital audio tape (DAT) drive, a DDS-format product,that is a component of the new Network Mass Storage System.andP;  Emerald Systemshas combined the features of EmQ and EmLIB software into one complete systemsolution for HP.andM;The software backs up local hard disk files (distributed throughout anetwork) and network hard disk files and security structures from any node toone or more tape drives attached to a file server within the Network MassStorage device.andM;EmLIB software, the only network librarian product of its kind, allows usersto navigate through large tape libraries and locate in seconds files thatpreviously took hours or even days to find.andP;  For particularly large off-linetape libraries with as many as 100 tapes or more, EmLIB can cut days off thetask of locating files.andM;The software performs media librarian functions by indexing databases to finduser data through an easy-to-use system query procedure.andM;Emerald Systems has optimized its EmQ/EmLIB software product to offercomprehensive backup and data librarian capabilities for the Novell NetWare386 environment that the Network Mass Storage System addresses.andP;  (EmeraldSystems' EmSAVE software also provides backup support for NetWare 386-basedPC networks.)andM;For its support of HP's Network Mass Storage System, Emerald Systems hasimplemented EmQ software as a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM).andP;  NLMs extend thecapabilities of the network by allowing users to add functions to the networkoperating system itself.andM;Implemented as an NLM, EmQ provides a client-server model for network backupand restore under NetWare 386, just as previous versions of EmQ software havedone for NetWare 286.andP;  The software runs off of the file server and providesthe user with the option of backing up not only the file server but alsoindividual workstations.andM;The EmQ NLM is combined with the EmLIB software to offer off-line librarymanagement capabilities for the Network Mass Storage System.andM;WINDOWS INTERFACE, FAST SEARCH CAPABILITIES The EmQ/EmLIB software productfor the Network Mass Storage System offers the same features that are alreadyincluded in the RAMP software family.andP;  These features include use of theMicrosoft Windows graphical user interface (GUI); extremely fast fileaccessing capabilities; and support for tape and drive spanning, which allowsfor large-volume backups.andM;One of the biggest problems facing network administrators who will utilizehigh-capacity storage products like the Network Mass Storage System is theability to quickly access files that need to be restored due to human erroror another interference.andP;  Emerald Systems solves this problem in two ways.andM;First, EmLIB provides near-instant indexing to the exact tape that containsthe file desired.andP;  Second, EmQ, like Emerald Systems' EmSAVE software,provides a rapid file retrieval solution called &quot;fast search&quot; or quick fileaccess.andM;The software commands the tape backup system, which in the case of the HPNetwork Mass Storage System is a 1.3-Gbyte DAT system, to seek for the fileby fast-forwarding or rewinding to the exact location of the file on tape.andO;Significant time savings are realized with this fast-search feature sincefile access times are approximately 20 seconds.andM;High-capacity backup systems without this quick file accessing capability mayexperience file accessing times of two to four hours.andM;AVAILABILITY EmQ and EmLIB software will be available in October for use withthe HP Network Mass Storage System.andP;  The software will be sold by HPauthorized dealers as a complement to the Network Mass Storage System.andP;  TheEmQ/EmLIB software is priced at $1,790.andM;Both the Emerald Systems software and the HP hardware products have beendesigned for use in mid-range to high-end PC server environments, such asCAD/CAM, accounting, business and desktop publishing applications.andM;Emerald Systems Corp., founded in 1984, is privately held.andM;Key Executives: Bob Root, president and chief operating officer of EmeraldSystems.andP;  Douglas M. Clifford, general manager of HP's Disk Storage Systemsdivision in Boise, Idaho.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
