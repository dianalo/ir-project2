The ruling gives three former Wells Fargo branch managersa chance to pursue state-law claims against the bank. Underthe National Bank Act, banks are entitled to fire officersfor any reason, so long as the action is taken by the banks'board. But California's highest court, in a strict reading ofthe statute, held that Wells Fargo couldn't avail itself ofthe act in this case because the workers were fired bylower-level officers who were merely delegated the authorityunder the bank's bylaws.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If the bank desires to invoke the privilege, it should,in fairness, be prepared to fulfill the statutory conditionsincident to its exercise, including the express condition ofthe board of directors' action,&quot; the court held.   The Civil-War era National Bank Act was passed on thetheory that banks should have summary authority to dismissofficials so as to deal quickly with any threats' to theinstitutions' solvency and thus to maintain public confidencein the financial system. Plaintiff lawyers have contended thelaw has become outmoded and abused, and that banks use thelaw to dismiss noncritical employees. They argued that thelatitude offered banks should apply only to senior officers,not branch managers or other middle-level executives. Amajority of the California court, however, declined to gothat far, and appeared to adopt a broad reading of whatemployees can be &quot;officers&quot; for purposes of the act.   Wells Fargo currently faces many claims of wrongfultermination and, regarding those cases, yesterday's ruling&quot;will make our defense more difficult,&quot; said David Darman, anattorney for the San Francisco-based banking concern.</TEXT></DOC>
