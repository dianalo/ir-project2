One goal of the research beingdescribed in this paper is to extend the range of applicability of thesemethods to more general systems of hyperbolic conversion laws such asmagnetohydrodynamics, flow in porous media and finite deformations ofelastic-plastics solids. A second goal is to apply Godunov methods toproblems involving more complex physical and solution geometries thancan be treated on a simple rectangular grid. This requires the introductionof various adaptive methodologies: global moving and body-fitted meshes,local adaptive mesh refinement, and front tracking. 11 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
