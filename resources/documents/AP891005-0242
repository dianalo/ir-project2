Lewis set the union on acourse of independence because of a bitter feud with other laborleaders.   The UMW's executive board Wednesday requested affiliation withthe 14 million member AFL-CIO, whose governing body is expected tounanimously welcome its newest member in time for the federation'sconvention next month.   ``This decision is a further indication of the strong spirit ofsolidarity that is manifest throughout the entire labor movement,''AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement.   UMW President Richard Trumka said the union's board ``decidedthat it is once again time for the UMWA to apply for membership inthe national labor federation, formalizing our ever-closer workingrelations with the AFL-CIO and its member unions.''   Good relations between Trumka and Kirkland and cooperationbetween the UMW and the AFL-CIO in recent years have fueledconstant speculation about the affiliation.   Kirkland, in 1983, became the first AFL-CIO president to addressa UMW convention and in 1985 Trumka became the first UMW chief tospeak at an AFL-CIO convention.   The AFL-CIO and its unions have been highly supportive of theUMW in its bitter, ongoing strike against the Pittston Coal Group.The UMW, in turn, has been working to help other unions in recentstrikes, particularly those against Eastern Airlines and regionaltelephone companies.   Affiliation also has been seen as a logical course for the UMWbecause of a precipitous decline in membership, which peaked atnearly 600,000 in the 1940s but has fallen below 100,000.   Lewis pulled the union from the American Federation of Labor in1936 to help found the rival Congress of Industrial Organizations.   He rose to CIO president, but resigned after Franklin D.Roosevelt was elected to a third term in 1940. Lewis, a Republican,a year later carried out his promise to pull the UMW from the groupif Roosevelt was re-elected.   The UMW rejoined the AFL in 1946 but left the next year. Lewistold the AFL of the decision in a terse note to FederationPresident William Green.   ``We disaffiliate,'' the note said.   Lewis was heir-apparent to Green, but was irate that the AFLnegotiated a compromise with federal officials who wanted unionleaders to sign affidavits saying they weren't members of communistorganizations or didn't sympathize with communists.   Among those who helped negotiate the compromise was GeorgeMeany, who succeeded Green.   The AFL and CIO merged in 1955. Lewis retired in 1960.   Meany was AFL-CIO president until he retired and was succeededby Kirkland a decade ago.</TEXT></DOC>
