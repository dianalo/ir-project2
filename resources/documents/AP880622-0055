Martin Gaffney, 39, filed the negligence lawsuit Tuesday in U.S.District Court, claiming the Navymishandled his wife's pregnancy bycausing their baby to be stillborn, then giving her a transfusionthat transmitted the deadly virus to him, his wife and a son bornlater.   ``I've asked for an apology,'' said Gaffney, a chief warrantofficer in the Marine Corps. ``Even the Soviet Union has apologizedfor killing an American soldier. But my own government won'tapologize for being responsible for the deaths of my wife and soneven though I serve them.''   Gaffney said he filed the lawsuit because he wants to providefor his 4-year-old daughter, Maureene. She is the only member ofthe family to escape infection and will likely become an orphan,Gaffney said.   He said he also decided to sue after the Navy responded with an``insulting'' settlement offer of less than $1 million to acomplaint he had filed internally.   ``It's been a very long, frustrating time waiting for the Navyto act,'' Gaffney said in an interview Tuesday. ``I realized Iwasted six months of my life waiting for the Navy to act.''   Gaffney's wife, Mutsuko, 38, a Japanese national, died in May1987. The couple's 13-month-old son, John, died in 1986. Gaffneylives with his daughter on a Navy base in South Weymouth, about 15miles south of Boston.   Though Gaffney's health is still good, he said he has madeprovisions for his daughter to live with his brother when he dies.   The Gaffneys were married in 1981, three years after meeting inOkinawa, and their first child was due that August.   The lawsuit claims Mrs. Gaffney went into the Navy RegionalMedical Center in Long Beach, Calif., one Saturday certain sheabout to give birth and a nurse sent her home.   Two days later, doctors discovered the baby had died. During asubsequent Caesarean section, Mrs. Gaffney was given two units ofblood, one of which was contaminated with the AIDS virus, thelawsuit says.   Navy officials traced the two donors, and one tested negativefor acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Gaffney said. The otherrefused to be tested and it was learned he had been discharged fromthe Navy for homosexual activity, Gaffney said.   Gaffney's claimed Navy officials have lied to him on severaloccasions and never apologized to him for what has happened to hisfamily.   Navy spokesman Lt. Ken Ross declined to comment on the lawsuitor Gaffney's charges of bad treatment.   Gaffney said his life has worsened since he filed the internalclaim against the Navy last year.   ``There are so many things I have to put up with every day,''Gaffney said. ``It's hard to put on that uniform every day. And I'mafraid every time I get my hair cut. I'm afraid that if I'm nickedI'll have to stand up and tell them who I am and what they have todo to protect themselves.''   Gaffney must cut his hair regularly under Marine guidelines. Hesaid he used to get his hair cut on base but now goes to differentcivilian barbershops.   But Gaffney said his Marine colleagues at the base have beensupportive and sympathetic.   He said that by seeking a financial settlement from the Navy, hewill be able to spend whatever time he has left with his daughterand avoid daily separations caused by his work.</TEXT></DOC>
