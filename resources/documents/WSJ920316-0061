The Clearwater, Fla., company called the move asignificant expansion that it expects to generate a&quot;double-digit&quot; increase in annual sales over the next year.For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the company expects toreport that sales rose about 46% to about $646 million. SomeWall Street analysts think the diversification could add 20%or more to sales over time.</LP><TEXT>   The software expansion will put Tech Data into a businessthat it says its customers have long urged, and will enableit to compete as a one-stop distributor to the so-calledvalue-added resellers that dominate its customer base. Theresellers buy computers and components and assemble them intocustom systems for retail customers, such as law and medicaloffices.   Tech Data previously focused on hardware, disk drives andperipheral products, such as printers, and its customers hadto look elsewhere for the application software for suchsystems. By contrast, its two larger competitors in computerdistribution, Ingram Micro Inc., Santa Ana, Calif., andMerisel Inc., El Segundo, Calif., already sell both hardwareand software.   Tech Data's expansion met with mixed reactions fromanalysts. Some analysts saw strong potential in the move,since Tech Data's two larger competitors earn roughly 45% to50% of their revenue from software application sales. &quot;It's avery significant move and has great potential,&quot; says KimberlyA. Stulo, an analyst with Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee who isbullish on the company's shares.   But others noted that conspicuously missing from TechData's list of software publishers are such giants asMicrosoft Corp., Lotus Development Corp. and BorlandInternational Inc. &quot;It's clear they haven't been able to getthe major brands,&quot; says Benny Lorenzo, an analyst with DillonReed andamp; Co. in New York.   Tech Data plays down such criticism. The company's chiefexecutive, Steven Raymund, conceded that Tech Data hasn't yetlured top brands. But he argued that the company is making arespectable beginning that has drawn some strong players,like Caere Corp., Micrografx Inc. and Ventura Software Inc.   &quot;We don't have any first-tier big names. But Rome wasn'tbuilt in a day,&quot; Mr. Raymund said, noting the company is in&quot;ongoing negotiations&quot; to add additional softwareapplications and expects the company's current line to&quot;double or triple.&quot; He said he is optimistic the heavyweightswill come on board once the division proves itself.   Tech Data's shares have been volatile in recent days.After climbing steadily to $41.25 a share by the beginning ofMarch, they have slid back a bit. On Friday, they plummetedas much as $5.50 a share, before rebounding to close at$34.25, off 75 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.Tech Data said it believed a sale by an institutional holderspurred the decline. Mr. Lorenzo said disappointment that thecompany hadn't lured bigger software names was also hurtingits shares.   Tech Data's Mr. Raymund, responding to the downward movein the company's shares Friday, estimated that fourth-quarternet income was &quot;50 cents a share or better,&quot; exceeding $3.9million, and topping Wall Street estimates. In theyearearlier quarter ended Jan. 31, Tech Data had net incomeof $2.2 million, or 35 cents a share. The company had7,837,000 shares outstanding in the latest period, comparedwith 6,244,000 shares a year earlier. Sales will be &quot;in the$200 million range&quot; compared with $122 million a year ago,Mr. Raymund said.</TEXT></DOC>
