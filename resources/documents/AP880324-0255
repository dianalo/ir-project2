George Bush, meanwhile, headed for Connecticutexpecting to pad his huge lead on the GOP side.   Gephardt said he'd made no decision to drop out, declaring, ``Mymother always told me to cross one bridge at a time.'' But thescramble was already on to pick up supporters who would be freed ifhe withdrew.   ``There's no question there are some union leaders who are nowsupporting Dick Gephardt who would find Paul Simon the mostattractive of the alternatives,'' said Illinois Sen. Simon at anappearance in Kalamazoo.   Simon, who is in fourth place in the Democratic delegate count,just ahead of Gephardt, spoke of getting ``back in the ballgame.''   Among the Republicans, former Transportation Secretary ElizabethDole, wife of Bush's main rival, Sen. Bob Dole, said in Oshkosh,Wis., that her husband now has merely a ``long shot'' chance, butshe added, ``He's got the grit and determination needed to keep himin the running.''   She said neither she nor her husband have discussed thepossibility that one of them might be Bush's running mate for thegeneral election. ``I'm really not seeking to be on the ticket. I'mgoing 12 hours a day just trying to carry Bob's message,'' she said.   Vice President Bush, holding a commanding lead in the battle forRepublican convention delegates, was traveling to Connecticut,saying he was taking nothing for granted in the primary there nextTuesday.   However, public opinion polls give him a big lead over Dole inthe state where Bush grew up and where his father once served as aU.S. senator.   Bush said at a news conference that it would be premature todiscuss pardons for any of the defendants in the Iran-Contraaffair, and that he did not think fallout from thearms-for-hostages deal would hurt his campaign.   ``If it was going to have an impact, I think it would havebefore now,'' he said.   A CBS-New York Times poll suggested Thursday night that ageneral election matchup of Bush and Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis would be a close race. In the poll, with a 3percentage-point margin of error, 46 percent picked Bush and 45percent chose Dukakis, who did the best of any of the Democratsagainst Bush in the poll.   Dukakis was in Los Angeles, campaigning in English and Spanish.   He denounced U.S. support of Nicaragua's Contra rebels, said hefavored a one-year extension in the deadline for illegal aliens toapply for amnesty and said when asked about the possibility of aHispanic running mate, ``Tal vez. ... Vamos a ver (Perhaps. ...We'll see).''   Democratic rival Jesse Jackson campaigned in Madison, Wis.,telling the Wisconsin Legislature that if he wins the nominationand election, ``As president, I will meet with the heads of statewhere drugs are grown ... and stop the flow of drugs.''   Albert Gore Jr.'s spokesman said David Garth, a well-known mediaconsultant who has previously worked for New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,had been hired to handle the Tennessee senator's advertising forthe New York primary.   Gephardt, just a few weeks ago the victor in Iowa's caucuses,now lags behind Dukakis, Jackson, Gore and Simon in delegates tothe national convention. He trails Dukakis and Jackson in publicopinion polls preceding Saturday's Michigan caucuses.   He said Thursday in Detroit, ``Rather than trying to guess allthe different hypotheticals of what might happen, I just think wehave to be patient, wait to see the outcome and then decide whatother steps should be taken.''   Still, Gephardt's wife Jane told a radio interviewer inMichigan, ``I think Dick has to come in first or a real strongsecond to remain in the race. ... If we don't do well here, we willnot be able to continue.''   The Missouri congressman has only until Tuesday to file forre-election to his House seat, and one aide, commenting only oncondition he not be named, suggested that it was important for thecongressman to retain that office in order to raise money. Hiscampaign has been strapped for cash for weeks.   Money was in the news for several other current and formercandidates on Thursday:   _Gore's campaign confirmed Thursday it borrowed more than $1.4million early this month, putting up collateral that includedfuture matching funds and a personal guarantee by the candidatehimself.   The move followed a report in the Nashville Tennessean newspaperabout the details of Gore's borrowing.   _The Federal Election Commission said that Gary Hart, now thathe is no longer a presidential candidate, can use leftover 1988campaign funds toward retiring his lingering debt of about $1million from his 1984 race.   _The FEC agreed to grant federal matching funds to politicalextremist Lyndon LaRouche's presidential campaign, even though heis standing trial on a charge relating to alleged financialirregularity in his 1984 campaign. LaRouche is running as aDemocrat, although the national party has disavowed his candidacy.   The Democrats, including Gephardt, were concentrating onMichigan and on Wisconsin, which has its primary on April 5.   Dukakis, who spent the first part of the week trading chargeswith Gephardt on foreign-trade policy, a major issue in a stateheavily dependent on U.S. auto sales, was in California but plannedto spend all day Friday in Michigan. The Detroit Free Pressendorsed him on Thursday.   Dole's aides said he had no campaign events scheduled Thursday.   Pat Robertson, meanwhile, urged 700 supporters in Falls Church,Va. to turn out in force at local Republican precinct meetings toselect delegates to the state and natonal GOP conventions.   Noting that Easter is ten days away, Robertson said the pressdeclared his candidacy dead after Super Tuesday. ``I don't thinkthey are aware of the Resurrection,'' he said.   ``In the next few weeks, as these caucuses unfold, we are goingto win the majority of delegates in the Republican Party inVirginia,'' predicted Robertson, who was beaten soundly by Bush inhis home state's non-binding primry on March 8.</TEXT></DOC>
