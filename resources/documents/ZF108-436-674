 However, the benefits appear to greatly outweigh theliabilities.andP;  The chief complaint leveled at the process is thatit puts people out of work.andP;  Actually, consolidation and the newtechnologies it requires make possible the creation of a morehighly skilled class of workers.andP;  Also, consolidation has provenitself much more than simply cost-effective.andP;  Reductions insalaries, software license fees, office rental outlays and travelexpenses make the process attractive to Information Systemsmanagers and executives.andP;  More importantly, increased efficiencyand new business opportunities have resulted from consolidation.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CentralizationData ProcessingInformation SystemsEfficiencyCost ReductionLayoffManagement of EDP.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Why Consolidation Makes SenseandM;Over the past five years, no word has struck more terror into the hearts ofinformation systems (IS) workers than consolidation.andP;  Consolidation is thesword that has brought strife and pain into their world--slashing IS budgetgrowth and destroying much of IS staffers' natural habitat, the glass houseor data center.andM;This is the way the IS rank and file view consolidation--a worldwidephenomenon that is now gripping the financial services, travel, automotiveand computer-manufacturing industries, among others.andP;  But such fear could bebased on a misunderstanding, say experts.andP;  Like any sword, this one isdouble-edged.andP;  There is a side that everybody sees, and a side that isn't soapparent.andM;Less visible but of far greater consequence to IS executives and their teamsare the new jobs and career options created by consolidation--not to mentionthe higher prestige it could bring to the entire profession.andP;  The newtechnologies that are enabling consolidation and putting some people out ofwork--machines and software that automate storage management and systems thatbring voice and data management under a single point of control--are thebedrock for new IS careers.andP;  They also are accelerating the evolution of thedata center into a network management center--a metamorphosis necessary formost organizations if they are to compete effectively on a global scale.andM;Across the United States and in parts of the Pacific Rim and Europe, untoldnumbers of data centers have shut down over the past five years.andP;  And thetrend shows no signs of abating.andP;  More than 30% of the Gartner Group Inc.'s500 user clients are either involved in or looking at consolidating theirdata centers to three large sites or fewer, says Jeff Schulman, a vicepresident at the Stamford, Conn.-based IS consulting and market researchfirm.andP;  The majority of Gartner's clients probably will have had a taste ofsuch consolidation by 1993, he believes.andP;  Data from the prestigious ResearchBoard in New York City confirm the trend.andP;  The board says its members,powerful multinationals headquartered across the world, are typicallyshifting from multiple data centers to an average of just two supercenters.andM;Consolidation is in the air at London-based communications giant BritishTelecom.andP;  Consultants close to the company reveal that it wants to reduce its40 or 50 data centers to a tenth of those numbers.andM;Make no mistake about it, cost is the chief motive in nearly all cases.andO;Often prodded by asset-conscious chief financial or executive officers, ISexecutives who collapse their transaction-intensive computer operations intoas few locations as possible see immediate reductions in bodies, softwarelicense fees, office rental outlays and travel expenses.andP;  &quot;There's clearlybeen too much fat in the Is budget,&quot; says Fleet Norstar's Zucchini, who saved$10 million for his Providence, R.I.-based superregional bank viaconsolidation.andP;  &quot;And most of it was in the form of dispersed anddecentralized data centers.&quot;andM;But efficiency may be the real dividend of consolidation for almost any userorganization--a dividend that's paid out in three ways.andP;  The first is anunprecedented level of network control, achieved by coupling voice and dataapplications within an organization.andP;  The second is greater resources to payhigher caliber IS workers attracted to the technical and career challengespresented by an organization smart enough to consolidate.andP;  The third and mostimportant dividend is the ability to seize business opportunities, madepossible in part by the economies of scale achieved through consolidation.andM;&quot;I know we've driven other banks out of pension management,&quot; says GeorgeDiNardo, executive vice president of information management and research atthe Mellon Bank NA in Pittsburgh.andP;  &quot;One of the major reasons we consolidatedwas to set up barriers to entry to our competitors.&quot;andM;Who Will Lose Their Jobs?andM;It's the other side of the issue, however, that continues to capture theattention of IS workers, causing them to equate consolidation with job loss.andO;ATandamp;T, for example, recently furnished an example of the side of consolidationthat IS professionals tend to see.andP;  In February, the communications giantrevealed that it will shut five of its 12 U.S.andP;  data centers.andP;  Dataprocessing for its accounting, marketing and engineering organizations willnow be concentrated in only six states, resulting in a $70 million reductionin annual expenses by 1992.andP;  The cutback means that 1,000 employees at ATandamp;TInformation Management Services will be offered early retirement, transfersor, failing this, they will be laid off.andM;And when Fleet Norstar collapsed its five-state operations into onesupercenter, it shut down 11 data centers and one service bureau.andP;  Part ofthe $10 million it trimmed from its $55 million IS budget came from reducingits IS work force by 26%.andM;The USS Steel Division of USX Corp. in Pittsburgh, in another example,recently shifting from two data centers to one supercenter, saving $5 millionand reducing its IS work force by 25% in the process.andM;Workers most vulnerable to such layoffs are those who occupy what Norbert J.andO;Connors, comptroller of computer services centers for U.S.andP;  Steel, callssemiskilled jobs.andP;  Those are individuals who handle tape and printers,distribute reports and perform operational functions that can be taken overby increasingly intelligent system software.andM;And, of course, such layoffs affect those who remain.andP;  The first thing you dofollowing consolidation, Connors recommends, is upgrade the skill levels ofthose remaining employees.andP;  &quot;You have to instill a mission control or centralwar room mentality into your people at the same time you upgrade such thingsas network and help desk management.&quot;andM;It's not hard to see why, in U.S.andP;  Steel's case.andP;  &quot;You may have shrunk thenumber of data centers,&quot; explains Connors, the company's top IS executive,&quot;but the spectrum of client [end-user] requirements keeps on expandingbecause of networks.&quot;andP;  A single supercenter in Pittsburgh anchored by two IBM3090 model 600S mainframe computers must now do everything that akaleidoscopic array of technologies formerly managed, as well as provide aplatform for new software yet to be created.andP;  Gone is the IBM 308X mainframecomplex in Chicago.andP;  Gone are the seven Unisys minis that performed orderentry, job-scheduling and product-tracking duties for numerous plants.andP;  Alsoout are the Hewlett-Packard Co. minis in the mills and the Control Data Corp.andO;machine used for vector processing.andP;  These and numerous planned applications,such as imaging, must now be handled by the supercenter.andM;This concentration of functions results in a concentration of highly skilledprofessionals, which can cause problems in its own right.andP;  That's why U.S.andO;Steel has created what it refers to as an ombudsman position, whose functionis to maintain a balance between rival factions in the supercenter and toarbitrate disputes.andP;  The steel maker's ombudsman, (actually called themanager of business systems availability) reports directly to Connors.andP;  Theposition, he quips, is for anybody drawn to high-pressure, thankless jobs.andM;Viewing the Big PictureandM;The dislocations caused by consolidation may, in fact, mask the largerimplications for IS.andP;  Consolidation often gives IS staffers the opportunityto cut their way through the chaos created by swiftly changing businessconditions and technologies.andP;  Even now, they are beginning to make economicand IS sense of the acquisitions, mergers, reversals or other events thatcharacterized their businesses in the 1980s.andM;Like many corporations, U.S.andP;  Steel had separate and incompatible voice anddata management organizations until it introduced its supercenter.andP;  Theconsolidated center now serves as the corporation's network management hub--atrue information utility in every sense of the word.andP;  The staff at thesupercenter, thanks to its now superior voice/data integration, will developnew applications for the whole corporation.andM;Tightly coupling data and communications responsibilities seems to be theobjective, or at least the outcome, of many consolidations.andP;  Another benefitis the ability provided by a strong networking infrastructure to developapplications in the most efficient manner.andM;ATandamp;T rival MCI Communications Corp. formerly had systems engineers handlingnetwork services and separate IS professionals who automated the company.andO;Now they work together under one roof in the company's newly created networkmanagement supercenters.andP;  The first supercenter is in North Royalton, Ohio,just outside Cleveland.andP;  Others will follow in Sacramento, Calif., and inBroken Arrow, Okla., near Tulsa, says Alan Ditchfield, vice president ofsystems engineering for MCI.andM;A strong network consisting of everything from multiplexers to Tariff 12software-defined network services and a disciplined approach to computerarchitectures is enabling E.I.andP;  du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co. to consolidate sixdata centers into four supercenters.andP;  Three of the four (in Oklahoma,Singapore and West Germany) will essentially be clones of the mainsupercenter in Wilmington, Del., headquarters for the giant industrialconcern.andM;The consolidation has been made all the easier by DuPont's decision long agoto limit its host computers to mainframe systems from IBM and minicomputersfrom Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard.andP;  &quot;In the future, we'd liketo have an open architecture so that we could take advantage of a singleoperating system and a single telecommunications protocol around the world,&quot;says Raymond Cairns, vice president of information systems for DuPont.andP;  Hisfirst step is to limit the technology by reducing the number of computercenters and support it remotely from a pool of systems programs at a masternetwork console, located in one heavily equipped center.andM;Where New IS Opportunities LieandM;Along the path toward creating more productive enterprises, IS execs areestablishing much more meaningful IS posts for today's times.andM;New positions recently unearthed by DATAMATION include supervisor ofrepository administration--a reflection of the flood of data repositories nowhitting the market.andP;  Manager of electronic trade and supervisor of electronicdata interchange are both reactions to the amount of goods and servicespurchased and ordered over network.andP;  And countless variations on network andcommunications analyst titles are cropping up.andM;And for those who cannot find a place in the new supercenters, there may beother opportunities.andP;  Of the 1,000 IS workers let go when ATandamp;T pared down toseven data centers, says Bill Elliott, vice president of informationprocessing at ATandamp;T's Information Management Services Group in Liberty Corner,N.J.: &quot;No workers at these sites were involuntarily terminated.andP;  Some chosenot to move to other areas or jobs within ATandamp;T and were snapped up by otherlocal companies because of the shortage of IS technicians across the nation.&quot;andM;The IS workers who do survive consolidations--and it's usually the majorityof them--will by necessity be highly skilled.andP;  They will be considered theelite of IS, if you will.andP;  &quot;And since many large companies are creating suchan elite,&quot; Fleet Norstar's Zucchini says, &quot;we'll end up competing with eachother on the basis of our ability to keep and nurture such highly prizedemployees.&quot;andM;The IS force in the new supercenters may have a lot more going for them thanbigger salaries and new career options, says one academic.andP;  They may also becatching the eye of the executive suite and even of Wall Street.andP;  &quot;When banksmerge, the only units actually consolidated are the IS groups,&quot; observes JaneLinder, assistant professor at Harvard University's Graduate School ofBusiness Administration in Boston, who has been studying consolidations inthe banking industry and the role that IS plays in them.andP;  &quot;IS becomes theonly thing the newly married companies have in common.&quot;andM;When such an IS consolidation results in big savings, it is an inspiration tomanagers of other business units in the newly formed company to performsimilar feats.andP;  &quot;The new IS organization shows that it can adapt well tochanging circumstance--[and can] even lead,&quot; says Linder.andM;In banking, the future is a matter of buy or be bought.andP;  So any bank that canput together a string of successful IS consolidations has market value.andP;  &quot;Astrong IS capability is well regarded on Wall Street and can increase theprice of a bank's stock,&quot; says Linder.andP;  If a bank has a powerful IS arm, itis often eager to get the message out.andP;  The accomplishments of FleetNorstar's Zucchini and his supercenter are now being pitched by a MadisonAvenue public relations firm.andM;The rationalization of the banking industry has resulted in largebank-holding companies with offices spread throughout states that permitacquisitions across their borders.andP;  What makes the acquisition strategy of anaggressive company such as Fleet Norstar feasible is the flexibility of itsnew supercenter--a quality that enables it to absorb the processing volume ofthe business entities the company buys.andP;  Zucchini calls Fleet Nostar'ssupercenter, located in downtown Albany, N.Y., his acquisition machine.andO;(Fleet Norstar actually has two programming teams--one in Albany and theother in Providence--supporting the supercenter.)andM;The Recognition MachineandM;At U.S.andP;  Steel, Connors might well call his supercenter his RecognitionMachine.andP;  &quot;My bosses tell me that our new center has resulted in improvedplanning and marketing information,&quot; the comptroller says.andP;  &quot;This alsoreflects well on the IS department.&quot;andM;The idea behind the older, dispersed data centers (the ones that are nowbeing closed by so many user organizations) was the ability to achieve aclose physical proximity to customers and be more accountable to end users.andO;&quot;It sounds good in theory,&quot; says Connors.andP;  &quot;But it didn't work so well inpractice.&quot;andP;  His company discovered that the more you upload and downloadbetween multiple data centers, the more your service quality falls off andyour costs increase.andP;  &quot;Keeping these centers synchronized is virtuallyimpossible,&quot; he says.andM;Decentralized data centers don't make sense, Connors says, because theyconflict with the very nature of a good data center--that of a utilityserving the interests of the entire organization.andP;  Like any good utility, hesays, success is based on large volume, low costs and good service.andP;  He andsome of his peers opting for supercenters say that a 50% boost in transactionvolume in and out of their info-hubs yields scale-related cost reductions ofaround 20%.andP;  &quot;Smaller, dispersed centers can't achieve such economies ofscale and in addition are locked into high fixed overhead costs,&quot; heexplains.andM;Some IS executives are even so bold as to believe that the ability to createthe supercenter can be the difference between thriving in a business segmentand failing in one.andP;  Mellon Bank's DiNardo thinks this way--and so apparentlydo some of his financial peers outside the United States.andP;  Companies thatcan't create supercenter economies in the 1990s will become the customers ofthose who can.andM;DiNardo's central IS utility already serves its employer's needs and those of1,000 outside clients from across the financial services realm.andP;  Each newcustomer DiNardo obtains, whether as a new Mellon acquisition or simply as anoutside client, increases his transaction volume, thus resulting in lowercosts.andP;  IBM aids in the process.andP;  When Mellon Bank purchases a new system(once every five years) it gets twice the total system power, in terms ofthroughput, for the same price.andP;  As long as DiNardo's volume IS growing, hehs the flexibility to cut prices to clients by up to 50% over the five-yearlife cycle of each mainframe, or 10% a year.andP;  The machines are alwayspurchased new and with the latest operating system release, depreciated overthe five-year period.andP;  Eventually, they are sold at a profit.andM;Incresed Work Load, Same StaffandM;Mellon was one of the three original test sites in the world for IBM'S NEWEnterprise Systems.andP;  Architecture (ESA) extension of its MVS operatingsystem.andP;  &quot;Through this alone, we were able to increase our work load by 30%last year without increasing our staff,&quot; DiNardo says.andP;  His operationssupport the whole of Mellon and a near $1 billion a year in outside businesswith two IBM 3090 model 600J mainframe systems.andP;  A live backup site has beencreated in Philadelphia around a single 3090 model 400E.andM;The giant Japanese financial-trading company Nomura Securities Ltd. seems tobe thinking along the same lines as Mellon Bank in marketing supercenterservices to other companies.andP;  Nomura is building supercenters in Britain thatwill house the computers of companies that can't afford to handle their ownIS work or are reluctant to do so.andP;  Nomura also will lease space on its owncomputers as well as providing the work force for the supercenters.andP;  &quot;One ofthe biggest problem British companies face,&quot; says Cornelia Varney, aconsultant with the Butler Cox Foundation in London, &quot;is the scarcity ofskilled IS labor.&quot;andP;  The Nomura approach circumvents this problem, onecompounded by elevated mortgage interest rates in the United Kingdom, whichhave reduced the mobility of workers.andM;Another variation on the theme is Nomura's Stock Port, a pension fundsmanagement application offered to customers in Japan.andP;  By combining itssupercentrs with the investment products it already sells, Nomura iseffectively &quot;locking in a market via technology,&quot; says Scott Russell, deputygeneral manager of the Information Technology department at SG WarburgSecurities' Tokyo office.andM;Perception vs.andP;  RealityandM;Some customers--namely business units within an organiztion--may be lockedout of IS operations that have been consolidated, some experts fear.andP;  Theyworry that some elite supercenters will become too inbred and remote.andP;  &quot;Theywon't be sensitive to the micro needs of an evolving business segment,&quot;Gartner's Schulman says.andM;Clearing Up MisperceptionsandM;But this drawback to consolidation isn't real, most IS executives insist.andO;&quot;We're .andP;  .  .  being accused of hating PCs and taking control away frombusiness units,&quot; says Fleet Norstar's Zucchini.andP;  &quot;And both charges are basedon a misperception of what we're trying to achieve through consolidation.&quot;andO;He stresses that companies are pursuing scale at the supercenter to create acounterweight to the huge expansion of desktop systems that occurred in the1980s.andP;  &quot;This expansion will continue.andP;  Companies will always want todifferentiate themselves and innovate.andP;  But they must integrate as well,&quot;says Zucchini.andP;  &quot;Companies want to integrate and diversify at the same time,and that is what is truly behind the creation of the central IS utility.&quot;andO;(see &quot;Tomorrow's Organization,&quot; February 1, 1990, p.22.)andM;Zucchini and others have chosen large-scale systems, data repositories andother centralized technologies for their integration task.andP;  &quot;It's not thatthey are better than PCs or distributed options.andP;  It's merely that these [thePCs] are devices of expansion and individualization, not consolidation,&quot; saysZucchini.andM;Linder says that the IS profession should not fear consolidation, but welcomeit.andP;  &quot;It's a stepping stone to greater prestige and influence for them.andP;  Itpermits them to emerge as a cohesive force, and as a leader,&quot; the Harvardprofessor says, &quot;and confers on them a sense of mission and purpose that wasmissing in the decentralized '80s.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
