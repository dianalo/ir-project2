The offer had been scheduled to expire at midnight last Friday. As previously reported, a federal judge issued a 10-day temporary restraining order against Bank of New York's purchasing additional shares in response to Irving's suit in what has turned out to be a bitter takeover battle.    Bank of New York has offered to buy Irving for about $67 a share, or $1.18 billion. Irving, on the other hand, wants holders to accept an $80-a-share cash offer from Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A. in a friendly transaction.    As of last Friday, said Bank of New York, 5,614,436 Irving shares had been tendered. Irving has a total of about 18.3 million shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
