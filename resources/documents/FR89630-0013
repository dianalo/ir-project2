Review Under Executive Order 12291This executive order, entitled ``Federal Regulations,'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by Office of Management and Budget prior to theirpromulgation. The OMB has concluded its review and has no objections tothe changes. B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisfor any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates,tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other directeconomic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences,such as changed construction rates. The Department of Energy certifiesthat this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared.C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collections in this rule have been cleared by the OMB underthe provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 etseq.), and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 1320.D. Review Under Executive Order 12612Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations,rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantialdirect effects on States, on the relationship between the national governmentand the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities amongvarious levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial directeffects, then the Executive order requires preparation of a federalismassessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementinga policy action.Today's final rule will revise certain policy and procedural requirements,for purpose of clarification and updating. States which contract with theDOE will be subject to the revisions. However, the DOE has determined thatnone of the revisions will have a substantial direct effect on the institutionalinterests or traditional function of States.E. National Environmental Policy ActThe DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432et seq.) (1976) or the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40CFR Part 1020) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comments on Proposed Rule</ITAG>The DOE issued a proposed rule (54 FR 1735, January 17, 1989) to clarifyand update certain policy and procedural requirements such as approvalauthorities for particular actions, addresses for certain submissions,changes in property recordkeeping requirements and asset codes, and clarificationregarding several contract clauses. Comments were requested through March3, 1989.The DOE received no public comments on the proposed rule. During internalreview, several recommendations were made for clarification or consistencypurposes and include the following changes:(1) At 913.505-3(B), the term ``contracting officer'' has been replacedby ``HCA or designee.''(2) At 916.301-3(C) ``may'' has been replaced by ``shall'' and HCA's aregiven discretion regarding any additional approval requirements.(3) At 970.3102-16, the introductory language has been reworded.(4) At 970.5204-27, the date of the clause has been changed from ``January1989'' to ``May 1989.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Ch. 9</ITAG>Government procurement.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Chapter 9 of Title 48 of the Codeof Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, June 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.
