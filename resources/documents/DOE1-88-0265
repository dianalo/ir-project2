The stabilityfeatures of processes with viscosity profiles that either decay algebraicallyupstream or exhibit percolation-like characteristics downstream are discussed.The latter pertains to viscosity profiles of the form: {mu}(z) = mu''sub(0)for z andgt; O; {mu} continuous at z = O; d{mu}/dz {similar_to} const ''centredot'' ( -z)sup(-m/(m+1)), with m andgt; O, for O andless; - z andless;andless; 1: {mu}(z) otherwisearbitrary for z andless; O. Compared to the case of exponentially decaying viscosityprofiles, two novel results are obtained. Viscosity profiles with algebraicdecay induce a logarithmic contribution to the rate of growth at smallwavenumbers of the disturbance. For percolation-like profiles, the rateof growth displays a power-law dependence on the wavenumber; thus itbecomes unbounded at large wavenumbers.</TEXT></DOC>
