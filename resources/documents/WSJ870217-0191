Stoddard, the embattled former chairman of Michigan National Corp., on charges of misapplying bank funds and conspiracy.    Mr. Stoddard, 55 years old, pleaded innocent Thursday to the two-count indictment in U.S. District Court here. The charges allege that between 1981 and 1983, Mr. Stoddard conspired to lease real estate to Michigan National at an above-market price.    Since resigning from Michigan National in 1984, Mr. Stoddard has been fighting a variety of federal charges, among them accusations by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency that he used bank funds for personal use. Directors requested Mr. Stoddard's resignation as a result of the government's investigation.    The Comptroller has proposed a $500,000 fine and asked that Mr. Stoddard be prevented from returning to banking without the government's permission. An administrative law judge held a hearing on those accusations last fall, and is expected to issue a ruling by June.    The criminal indictment says Mr. Stoddard, while running Michigan National, arranged for an unidentified party to buy a piece of property in Jackson, Mich. A Michigan National subsidiary then signed a 10-year, $270,000 lease on the property -- an amount &quot;substantially in excess of that which would have occurred had the transaction been negotiated between unrelated and willing parties,&quot; the indictment says.    Mr. Stoddard and a partner then bought the property, according to the charges. The actions were part of a conspiracy to defraud the bank of $175,000, the indictment says.    Mr. Stoddard and his attorney here, Neil Fink, weren't available for comment. But Mr. Fink's office released a statement from Mr. Stoddard that said, &quot;There is not one grain of truth contained in these charges. Since my family and I first learned of these accusations our lives have been a continuing nightmare . . . I intend to defend myself in a court of law and not in the media. I look forward to the day I will be vindicated.&quot;    Mr. Stoddard was released at his arraignment on a $15,000 personal bond. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for next Tuesday. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine.    Mr. Stoddard has been accused before of improper property transactions with Michigan National. A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation prompted the bank in 1978 to conduct an independent review of various sale-and-leaseback transactions.    That review found nine cases in which the company paid a total of $73,000 above market value to bank-affiliated parties, according to Michigan National's 1979 proxy statement to shareholders. Seven of those transactions involved Mr. Stoddard, and another involved his wife, according to the statement.    Mr. Stoddard didn't comment on the accusations when they were made, and efforts to reach his lawyer over the holiday weekend were unsuccesful.    The bank's board also passed a resolution at that time preventing future sale-leasebacks with company officials except when no alternatives existed, and then only after an independent appraisal. In 1981, the SEC accused Michigan National of inadequately disclosing the sale-leasebacks. The company, without admitting or denying the findings, agreed to an outside review of the arrangements.    The transaction that prompted the current criminal indictment began five months after the SEC settlement, according to court papers. Ellen Broadman, the attorney handling the case for the Comptroller, said she discovered the transaction after the hearing on the Comptroller's charges began, but was unsuccessful in receiving permission from the judge to include it in her case. </TEXT></DOC>
