The proposal is expected to be part of a far-reaching rewrite ofthe 1970 Clean Air Act that Bush will unveil Monday. He was spendingthe weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., puttingfinishing touches on the package.   Bush's expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide _ emittedmainly by coal-fired power plants and identified as a mainingredient in forming acid rain _ is not quite as tough as the12-million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists.   But it was far stronger than utilities and other coal-burningindustries have advocated _ and represents a dramatic turnabout fromthe Reagan adminstration's resistence to any new standards forcontrolling acid rain.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had made``preliminary decisions'' on the clean-air package, but would makeup his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend while atCamp David.   ``He is taking with him decision memos and options on all themajor questions that are still outstanding, and we would expectdecisions over the weekend,'' Fitzwater said.   Among the decisions still to be resolved, presumably, are whetherBush's package will set new standards for automobile tailpipeexhausts.   However, administration officials, perhaps signalling a decisionagainst tighter tailpipe emission standards, have stressed in recentdays that the Bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternativeauto fuels _ like alcohol blends _ that contain fewer contaminants.   After unveiling the clean-air package on Monday, Bush was toshowcase it on a two-day trip west, with clean-air speeches plannedfor Wyoming and Nebraska.   Cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year2000, as Bush was expected to recommend, would reduce thecontaminent to roughly half current levels.   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidescombine with water in the atmosphere to form acid which then returnsto Earth in the rainfall, snow and dust.   Midwestern utilties that burn high-sulfur coal withouttechnological controls are generally agreed to be the chief sourcesof much of the acid rain downwind of them, damaging forests andlakes in Canada and the Northeast.   Bush's acid-rain reduction program is expected to be in twophases with half of the 10 million-ton cut in sulfur dioxideemissions to be achieved by 1995 and the remainder by the year 2000,according to sources.   It was unclear Friday how the reduction requirements would bedistributed among electric power plants nationwide.   According to sources, the president was provided options thatranged from hitting the 20 dirtiest plants hardest during the firstphase, forcing them to come up with most of the early reductions, tospreading the burden across 107 plants across the country nationwidewith each plant requiring smaller cuts in emissions.   The president also is expected to include in his proposal asystem by which a utility that exceeds the reduction requirementsmay sell ``credits'' to another utility that has not met the loweremissions levels to help bring that utility into compliance.   Bush also is considering a reduction in nitrous oxide emissions,another component of acid rain which primarily comes from electricutility plants and automobiles. Nitric acid is suspected of causingsome kinds of forest damage.   Options prepared for Bush by the Cabinet-level Domestic PolicyCouncil suggest that nitrous oxides be cut by 2 million to 4 milliontons. The list of options was obtained by The Associated Press.   The utility industry has complained that if the 20 worstpolluting plant are required to make drastic cuts it would meansharply higher electric rates for the customers of those utilities.   An Ohio utility company, American Electric Power, said Friday ifthe 20-plant option is adopted, it would be forced to raiseresidential electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent.   Six of the 20 dirtiest power plants, all of which burn highsulfur coal, are in Ohio.   ``The cost of such emission reductions will grind the economiesof the Midwestern states. Our heavy industries which rely upon lowenergy costs ... would be devastated,'' said A. Joseph Dowd, seniorvice president of American Electric Power.</TEXT></DOC>
