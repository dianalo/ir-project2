Attorney Brendan Sullivan later rested his case, having called16 witnesses for the defense. Prosecutors, who called 29, said theywill have a few rebuttal witnesses on Friday.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he probably will givethe jurors Monday off while he decides what final instructions theywill be given. He said final arguments probably will take two daysand the case should go to the jury on Thursday, in the 12th week oftrial.   During four days of tough cross-examination, North deniedprosecution contentions that he lied about his Iran-Contra effortsand personally profited from some of them. He said he had explicitauthorization from his superiors _ and, he assumed, from PresidentReagan _ for his actions and didn't take a dime he wasn't entitledto.   He testified Thursday that two days before the Nov. 25, 1986,press conference, in which Reagan and Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII took part, North had been interviewed for four hours by Meeseand aides.   He is accused of lying during that interview. But he testifiedhe told them readily about ``the secret within the secret'' _ thatprofits from arms sales to Iran had been funneled to the guerillasfighting the leftist government of Nicaragua. Therefore, he said,he was shocked to learn that he might be the target of a criminalinvestigation.   What he heard as he watched the press conference on television,North said, ``was inconsistent with what I told the attorneygeneral two days before.'' Meese said North's boss, JohnPoindexter, had known of the money diversion but hadn't approved it_ when, in fact, he had.   North testified, ``It was very clear to me that this was part ofpointing the finger at Ollie North. He was `the only one who knewwhat was going on' _ which, I must say, is the way it was supposedto be.'' North's firing and Poindexter's resignation as Reagan'snational security adviser were announced by Meese that day.   Both at the trial, which began Jan. 31, and at congressionalhearings nearly two years ago, North said he had assumed while hewas directing covert aid to the Contras that he would have to takethe rap if word got out about the help, which was being provided ata time that official U.S. aid was banned.   Prosecutor John Keker's final questioning of North concerned twoletters he wrote in December 1986 to a contractor who had installeda $13,800 security system at North's home. The letters werebackdated to make it appear North had intended to pay for thesystem, which had been paid for by retired Maj. Gen. RichardSecord, whom North had recruited to run the Contra supply effort.The letters are the basis for one charge, that North accepted anillegal gratuity.   North was still in the Marine Corps, he said, and didn't want tofabricate the letters at work because he didn't want the Marinesinvolved in ``that type of cover-up.'' Therefore, he testified, hewent to a catalog store to write the letters on display typewriters.   Another of the 12 charges against North is that he obstructed apresidential inquiry by lying to Meese and by altering, destroying,concealing and removing documents from the National SecurityCouncil office where he worked.   Relying on notes taken at the Nov. 23, 1986, meeting by Meesechief of staff John Richardson, Keker led North through facts thatappeared to have been omitted by him in the Meese meeting. Northsaid that the prosecutor was basing his questions on a ``verycryptic description of four hours of conversation.''   He said he could not remember details of the interview. But healso said, ``I did the very best I could in telling the truth andanswering their questions. ... I have told you when I didn't tellthe truth.''   A day before the Meese interview, a search of North's office haduncovered a memorandum that spelled out the money trail from Iranto Nicaragua.   ``By golly, when it was raised I told them the truth,'' Northtestified. ``When I got back to the White House I called to AdmiralPoindexter to tell him the secret within the secret was now knownto four other men.''   The prosecution says North lied at the meeting about NSCinvolvement in the diversion, about Israel's role and theinvolvement of Secord.   The 12 felony charges against him also include lying to andobstructing Congress, converting Contra traveler's checks to hisown use and conspiring to defraud the Treasury and the InternalRevenue Service.</TEXT></DOC>
