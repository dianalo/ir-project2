IBM fired the latest salvo in the struggle by unveiling anew PC, the Model 25 286, aimed at teachers andadministrators. But industry executives said Apple, which hasseen its share of the education market tumble sharply in thepast four years, will strike back as early as next week byslashing prices that schools pay for several models of itsMacintosh computer.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, in a videocassette mailed this week to thousandsof educators across the country, Apple Chairman John Sculleypromised that an inexpensive, color Macintosh will debutduring the 1990-1991 school year, and that the long-rumoredcomputer will be able to run programs written for thefast-fading Apple II machine.   Education and computer experts said Apple's moves werelargely defensive, however, and credited IBM with seizing theinitiative in a market that has long been owned by Apple.   The education market over which the two computer makersare scrapping is estimated at about $750 million a year inthe U.S. Industry marketers said its importance far outstripsits dollar value, because it imprints brand andoperating-system loyalties on the young that translate intobillions of dollars of future sales.   Hence the intensity with which this marketing battle isbeing fought. &quot;Apple has fallen behind in some areas, andpeople have become a little panicked,&quot; said Charlotte Arnold,director of marketing and product dissemination forHumanities Software Inc., a Hood River, Ore., publisher ofeducation software. &quot;IBM has taken that ball and run withit.&quot;   Specifically, educators faulted Apple for failing toprovide an easy evolutionary path from the aging Apple II,which is still the dominant computer in education, to theMacintosh, which Apple has touted as its natural successor.At present, the machines can't run each others' software. Inaddition, educators said, even low-end Macintoshes remain tooexpensive for many schools.   &quot;It was clear to everybody that they needed to get out ofthe (Apple II) as soon as the (Macintosh) came along,&quot; saidKerry Johnson, director of information services andeducational technology for the Sacramento City Unified SchoolDistrict. &quot;They should have graduated and moved on; instead,they kept us in the old technology and marketed the hell outof it,&quot; he added.   IBM has stepped into this breach over the past two years,educators said, releasing a slew of inexpensive products andprograms aimed at tempting Apple users to convert to IBMPersonal System/2 PCs.   Besides earmarking a specific model, the Model 25, for theeducation market, IBM has courted administrators and teachersby offering discounts, seminars and software designed inconsultation with education experts. In addition, IBM hasplayed up its strong image in the corporate world, and madeuse of its far-flung marketing and service abilities.   &quot;I am persuaded that, more than at any time in the pastseveral years, they are making a tremendous commitment inthis marketplace,&quot; said Robert Pearlman, national consultanton educational technology for the American Federation ofTeachers. &quot;They are taking it very, very seriously,&quot; he said.   Indeed, IBM Chairman John Akers emphasized the company'shuge gains in education at the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant'srecent annual meeting in Phoenix. For the latest completeacademic year, 1988-1989, IBM's share of the primary andsecondary school market had risen to 30% from 5% in1985-1986. In the same period, Apple's share fell from 70% to54%.   Then Mr. Akers made an audacious prediction. &quot;When wecount it up at the end of this year,&quot; he said, &quot;there's agood chance that IBM will be the market-share leader for theyear in kindergarten through 12th grade. . . . We'd like tohave young people who have their first experience with acomputer, either at home or in school, to have it with an IBMcomputer.&quot;   Most market watchers said this scenario may be a littletoo optimistic. Some said IBM's gains, while sharp, may proveto be temporary, and that Mr. Akers will end up with egg onhis face.   &quot;The story for 1990-1991 is going to be a very strongcomeback for Apple,&quot; said Peter Kelman, publisher ofScholastic Software, an educational software concern that isa division of Scholastic Inc. &quot;With the cheap color(Macintosh), they are definitely going to regain leadership.They've never lost the hearts and minds of the teachers.&quot;   Mr. Kelman also said many publishers of educationalsoftware have become disillusioned with IBM computers, evenas those computers gain ground in the schools. IBM machinesare perceived to be harder to use than Apple computers, andschools tend to buy them as part of &quot;Integrated LearningSystems&quot; -- highly structured packages of hardware andsoftware that guide students through a predeterminedcurriculum.   That doesn't leave much room for software developers tocome up with the same kind of innovative, easy-to-useprograms that are possible with the Macintosh, Mr. Kelmansaid. And such programs have proved in the past to be acrucial ingredient for success in the education market.   In addition, Apple has cultivated an image as aneducation-oriented company for years, and it has made a bigshow of donating PCs to schools. Although IBM's efforts aregaining it many converts in the schools, it has a lot ofcatching up to do.   The 1990-1991 school year may prove to be crucial in thisregard. While Apple's engineers struggle to come up with amachine that can turn back IBM's gains, Mr. Sculley and otherexecutives must convince educators that they haven't beenforgotten, countering accusations that Apple is running afterbig corporate clients by concentrating on high-pricedmachines -- a move that Apple defends as necessary to fillout its product line. IBM, meanwhile, has been focusing muchof its PC efforts on the low end, giving the impression itcares about a market Apple is neglecting.   In essence, Apple's message is: Trust us, and give usanother year. &quot;Our product development efforts have shiftedtoward the lower end of the Macintosh product line,&quot; Mr.Sculley said on the videocassette sent to educators.&quot;Education is deep in the roots of Apple. It's where webegan; it's the most important long-term strategic objectivethat we have for our company,&quot; he said.   Bernard Gifford, Apple's vice president for education, isblunter. Admitting that the company has been bleeding marketshare for the past two years, he says it's because Apple hasfailed to provide enough inexpensive Macintosh products. Heespecially rues the lack of a low-end Mac with a colorscreen, because color bolsters children's interest inlearning. Although the Apple IIgs has a color screen, it'sseen as yesterday's technology; IBM has provided low-endcolor computers for years.   &quot;I'm truly sorry that we can't provide that producttoday,&quot; Mr. Gifford said. &quot;But we will have it in the nextschool year, and frankly, we think it's going to be abarn-burner. . . . The (yet-to-be-announced) pricing actionon the compact Macintosh, and the introduction of anentry-level color Mac that will run Apple II software, willnot only arrest our decline on market share, it will alsoreverse the trend,&quot; he said.   But many education watchers think IBM has put a permanentcrimp in Apple's claims to market leadership. Some point tothe trend toward hooking computers together in schools: IBM'scomputers are much easier than Apple's to connect to eachother. Others note that, having gained market share, IBM isunlikely to relinquish it, and it may even be on enough of aroll to fulfill Mr. Akers's expectations.   Ann Wujcik, an analyst for Link Resources Inc., a marketresearcher, thinks the decisive factor will be psychological.&quot;IBM has changed its image totally in the eyes of the schoolcommunity,&quot; she said. &quot;There is now a serious belief thatthey care as much or more than Apple.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,IBM rose $1.125 to close at $112.375. Apple fell 50 cents to$41.375 in national over-the-counter trading.</TEXT></DOC>
