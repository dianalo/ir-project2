Phelan Jr.announced.   Phelan said Thursday the probe involves trading in both the NewYork securities and Chicago futures exchanges and focuses on anillegal financial market strategy called ``front-running.''   After a speech to corporate investor relations officials, Phelanalso said he was not concerned about reports that largeinstitutions have not scaled back their program trading despite aBig Board request for voluntary restraint.   The exchange Thursday also defended its method for measuring theamount of monthly program trading after Business Week magazineasserted the Big Board calculation erroneously doubles the figure.   The NYSE last month instituted a series of reforms amid agrowing outrcy by some securities firms and lawmakers that acomputerized trading strategy known as index arbitrage had made themarket more volatile.   Phelan said the NYSE and other regulators were examining thepossibility of ``front-running'' or other manipulative tactics inthe program trading strategy known as index arbitrage.   In front-running, a broker buys or sells stocks or futures forits own account ahead of a customer's order, using the knowledgethat the customer order is likely to affect prices in the market.   Exchange officials confirmed that the study includes the ChicagoMercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade. Officials arelooking at sharp price swings in the market last July that may berelated to program trading.   ``There's a lot of concern that the type of trading actuallygoing on creates a lot of opportunity for abuse,'' NYSE spokeswomanSharon Gamsin said. ``We have not necessarily identified specificsituations we are looking at.''   The Big Board defines program trading as any order for thesimultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks valued at morethan $1 million. Index arbitrage involves rapid trading of stocksand stock-index futures traded in Chicago to profit from momentaryprice discrepancies between the two.   Index arbitrage defenders say the strategy helps stabilizetrading by linking the two markets, pulling prices closer together.   Morris Markovitz, an stock-index futures trader at thecommodities firm Mercury Management Associates Inc., said possibleprogram trading manipulation should not be used as another excuseto criticize the strategy.   ``When you put poison in a cup of cocoa you don't ban the cocoa,you ban the poison,'' he said.   Business Week contends in its Nov. 20 issue, released Thursdayto the media, that the NYSE's method of calculating program tradingvolume exaggerates the total. The Big Board divides program stocksales and purchases by total volume, whereas trading by specialistsis divided by twice the total volume.   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano said the calculation accountsfor differences in the two types of trading. He said the exchangehas made public its methodology monthly since it began calculatingprogram trading volume in July 1988.   ``The numbers we have published for the last 18 months arecorrect,'' Torrenzano said. ``It appears Business Week doesn't likethe methodolgy we use. That doesn't make the numbers wrong.''   Among its reforms, the NYSE requested that its member firms askcustomers to refrain from all types of program trading unless itwould have a ``stabilizing influence in the market;'' installedslowdowns when the market declines rapidly; and limited access ofprogram trades to the NYSE's computerized order system.   But market players said that large institutions show no signs ofabating their program trading. Stock-index funds such as WellsFargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon CapitalManagement are among the largest stock-index arbitrage clients onWall Street.   Phelan said he is not yet concerned because the voluntarypullbacks were designed for periods of volatility.   ``We're just trying to get in in,'' Phelan said after a speechto the National Investor Relations Institute. ``We haven't hitthose periods of market illiquidity we talked about.''   The impact of the battle over program trading should becomenoticeable within two weeks, when the NYSE issues its first weeklyreport on total program trading activity. Until now, the exchangeissued monthly figures.   Debate over program trading intensified after the Oct. 13190-point market drop and a rapid 80-point rise on Oct. 24. MajorWall Street brokerages dropped index arbitrage and investors andcorporations lashed out at the strategy as scaring away individualinvestors.   Phelan said he supports legislation to help control volatilitybut slowing the market down is preferable to banning programtrading _ which only Congress could do.   ``There are millions of gallons of alcoholic beverages producedin this country. That doesn't mean you have to be sloshed everyday,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
