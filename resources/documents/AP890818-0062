Yariv Bar-Yosef, 25, shot himself in the head with his Uzimachine gun early Thursday, the reports said. An army spokeswomansaid she could not comment because the case involving Bar-Yosef wasstill under investigation.   Also today, a new security policy went into effect that requiresPalestinians entering Israel to carry computerized identity cards.Palestinians said they would boycott their jobs in Israel to protestthe restriction.   Traffic into Israel was light from both Gaza and the occupiedWest Bank. But officials blamed this more on Friday being the Moslemprayer day than on the call by uprising leaders for workers toboycott jobs in Israel.   Palestinian reporters said a true test of the boycott wouldprobably come Sunday, when workers from the West Bank and Gaza Stripreturn to Israel after the Jewish Sabbath.   Israeli officials say the card system is intended to preventthose with criminal or security records from entering Israelfollowing a series of attacks on Jews by Arabs.   Palestinians argue the system is a further attempt by Israel toquell the revolt against occupation by putting an economic squeezeon Gaza, where poverty is widespread and few jobs are available.   At least 537 Palestinians have been killed in clashes withsoldiers or other Israelis in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprisingagainst Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Ninety-five other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs asalleged collaborators with Israel, and 38 Israelis also have beenslain.   Bar-Yosef was among soldiers being investigated by militarypolice in connection with the Aug. 22, 1988, beating death of HaniEl-Shami, 42, in the Gaza Strip. A military tribunal ruled that thedeath resulted from blows El-Shami received at the army's Jabaliyadetention following an earlier beating that day by soldiers at hishome.   Four soldiers of the elite Givati brigade, who are stationed atthe Gaza Strip's Jabiliya refugee camp, were acquitted ofmanslaughter and convicted of brutality.   Bar-Yosef, who was not among those convicted in the earliertrial, served in a reserve unit as a guard in the detention center.He testified that he kicked El-Shami in the shoulder on the day hedied, the daily Yediot Ahronot said today.   The trial raised a controversy over Defense Minister YitzhakRabin's declared policy of beating Palestinian demonstrators in aneffort to halt the uprising against Israeli occupation.   Shortly after the trial, a military judge was appointed to reopenthe inquiry into El-Shami's death. Yediot said Bar-Yosef wasquestioned several times since by military police.   According to Yediot, Bar-Yosef said in the suicide note he fearedhe would become the next scapegoat of the Givati affair. He referredto Israel as ``a land that devours its people'' and expressed fearshe would be imprisoned.   Bar-Yosef, a student at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, was founddead outside government-owned Israel Television, where he workedpart-time as a security guard. He had been shot in the head with hisown Uzi. </TEXT></DOC>
