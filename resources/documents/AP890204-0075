Although older Japanese cling to the work ethic that rocketedthis country from World War II devastation to economic superpowerstatus, their children have decided all work and no play made Japana dull nation.   Shoko Shima, 31, works 45 hours a week as a translator, aboutaverage for the Japanese.   But she also takes time to work out regularly at a health cluband play tennis and golf. ``People used to work for work's sake ortheir family's sake. But now many of us work to have free time,''Ms. Shima said.   ``More and more young people are choosing part-time jobs so theycan work when they want instead of being tied to a big company.''   In some ways, Japan today is a nation bent on enjoying itself:the number of official holidays surpasses that of the United States,and young people's vision of the future does not include workinggrueling hours and blind loyalty to a company.   ``Many people today say their hobby is work, and the older onesespecially say it with a sense of pride,'' said Sumiko Iwao, apsychologist who teaches at Tokyo's Keio University. ``But youngerpeople today are saying `No, that's not my cup of tea.' ''   ``In the future, productivity will decline, but that's not badbecause it is much better for Japanese to enjoy life and relax thanjust work all the time,'' Ms. Iwao said.   But the old ways continue, especially in the highly chargedbusiness world.   ``If you want to succeed in business in Japan, you still have towork from 9 to 9,'' Ms. Shima said.   The average Japanese worked 2,150 hours in 1986 _ about 225 hoursmore than Americans and almost 500 more than West Germans, accordingto Labor Ministry statistics. In 1987, the Japanese figure edged upby 18 hours.   The government embraced the idea of a five-day workweek in 1985,partly to reduce big trade surpluses. More leisure time, the theorygoes, would equal increased spending on imports, an expansion ofrecreational industry, more domestic spending.   But no one said it would be easy.   Office worker Kayoko Kumagai, 41, divides her free time betweenhousehold chores, bowling and working out at her health club. Buther 37-year-old husband, a company worker, ``just lies around thehouse'' on his one day off a week, she said.   Like most Japanese, Kumagai has grown used to working six days aweek with only Sundays off.   ``Not many people realize they are working too much. They take itfor granted,'' said Mrs. Kumagai. She counts her husband among them,and added, ``My husband wouldn't be able to figure out what to do ifhe had weekends off.''   When the government announced plans to give about 58 percent ofpublic servants two Saturdays off a month, people complained theycould no longer pay taxes, apply for travel visas or visit thenational library every Saturday. The so-called ``twin holidays''went into effect Jan. 14.   Financial institutions went to a five-day workweek Feb. 1, andthe government hopes other businesses will follow suit. It hastargeted 1993 for a uniform five-day workweek.   Meanwhile, Japan is creating more leisure time by expanding thenumber of official holidays from 12 in 1988 to 13 this year, wellahead of the 10 holidays a year enjoyed by some Americans.   ``The Japanese find `vacant time' excruciatingly difficult, andcome nowhere near enjoying its advantages,'' wrote former governmentofficial Taichi Sakaiya in the daily Japan Times.   Japanese tend to hustle even on vacation, Sakaiya noted: ``Anoverwhelming number of Japanese prefer the quickie type of packagetour such as five European cities in eight days.''   Today, sports, travel and relaxing at home with videos, stereosand computers are the most common ways Japanese spend their leisuretime, a change from a few years ago when the majority in a surveysaid sleeping was their favorite pastime away from work.</TEXT></DOC>
