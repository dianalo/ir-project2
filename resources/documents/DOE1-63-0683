With regard to the geothermal power generationin the world, its total plant capacity was 4,750MW showing about 10%over the preceding year. In USA, her exploitation activities were strongand she led the world by reaching her total plant capacity of 2,006MWoccupying 42% of that of the whole world. The Philippines showed 894MWranking the second, Mexico 645MW ranking the third, Italy 504MW rankingthe fourth then Japan followed. NEDO continued its surveys for expeditinggeothermal explorations and drilled 26 wells at 11 places in the sameyear. Concerning its demonstration surveys of geothermal prospectingtechniques, etc., NEDO drilled two demonstration wells, one for eachof the Sengan Region and the Kurikoma Region. Furthermore, as the lastyear of the second nationwide integrated surveys of the geothermal resources,it drilled one well at each of four regions. (1 fig, 5 tabs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
