Late Saturday, about 24 hours after receiving the emergency ruling, Eastern posted $4.7 million with a lower federal court -- a sum representing a month's salary for the employees Eastern expects to furlough as a result of the cutbacks.    Eastern would have to forfeit the money if the appeals court later found the layoffs to be illegal under the Railway Labor Act, as Eastern's unions have argued and as the lower court ruled. The wages for all 4,000 employees total roughly $7 million a month, but Eastern expects that many of those workers will take early retirement or will accept transfers to other posts.    The ruling permitting the layoffs came at about 8 p.m. EDT Friday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C., which stayed an injunction entered last week by U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker in Washington. Judge Parker ruled that by wiping out 4,000 jobs without first bargaining with Eastern's labor unions, the company violated several provisions of the Railway Labor Act, which gives unions a powerful voice in the affairs of airlines.    Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., Houston, didn't comment on its weekend victory in court, except to say that the layoffs would begin Sept. 10. Charles Bryan, the head of the machinists union at Eastern, asserted that Friday's temporary order by the appeals court &quot;has nothing to do with which way the case will go&quot; when full hearings are held.    If the appeals court maintains its ruling after a full hearing, the victory would be important not only for Eastern but for the entire airline industry. A group of carriers, including some of Eastern's toughest competitors, had filed a friend-of-the-court brief asserting that the unions were stretching the Railway Labor Act far beyond its intent and that job cutbacks were an essential right of management in the highly seasonal, highly competitive airline business.    Although the $4.7 million appeals bond represented barely 1% of Eastern's cash as of June 30, Eastern needs all the cash it can get. Operating deficits have rapidly consumed cash at the carrier, which, following the Labor Day weekend, now faces the slackest travel period of the year in its mostly north-south markets. Speculation is widespread that Eastern will seek to sell as quickly as possible many of the planes idled as a result of its recent layoffs and service cutbacks. </TEXT></DOC>
