RTE also said it is &quot;continuing to explore other financial alternatives to the offer, including a possible leveraged recapitalization of the company.&quot;    Mark IV hadn't any comment on RTE's statement that it is talking to other parties who might top Mark IV's $33-a-share offer.    Prior to the announcement from RTE, Mark IV extended until May 9 from May 3 its $33-a-share offer for RTE. RTE's board has rejected the unsolicited bid, which it calls inadequate, and has urged shareholders not to tender their stock. Through last Friday, only 217 RTE shares had been tendered to the suitor.    RTE shares, which have been trading well above the offer price as investors anticipate a higher bid, closed yesterday at $39.50, up 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Separately, Mark IV said it agreed to acquire Cetec Corp., an El Monte, Calif., maker of communications, plastics and automotive products, for $11 a share, or about $20 million.    Mark IV, West Amherst, N.Y., makes products for several industries, including aerospace and defense. The merger agreement has been approved by the boards of both companies. Cetec shares closed yesterday at $10.50, up 87.5 cents, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
