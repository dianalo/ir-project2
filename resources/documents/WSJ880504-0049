The committee voted 27-14, after defeating several attempts to dilute the measure. The full House is expected to vote on the measure soon. The Senate is expected to hold hearings on a similar bill this month, with a vote perhaps in June.    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.) said the legislation will raise the cost to South Africa's white minority government of maintaining the country as &quot;one vast slave plantation&quot; in which whites profit from the exploitation of blacks.    Opponents said the legislation will hurt black South Africans and that thousands of American jobs are likely to be lost.    The bill would forbid any U.S. citizen from holding any investment in South Africa, would bar all imports except certain strategic minerals and would bar most exports to South Africa. It would authorize $40 million for economic aid to disadvantaged South Africans.    The measure would replace the law enacted over a presidential veto in 1986 that put in place several specific sanctions but permitted U.S. companies to remain in South Africa. </TEXT></DOC>
