Threezones, namely combustion, distillation and unaltered coal were detected.Combustion had taken place in the uppermost part of the coal seam, immediatelybelow the melted roof rock, the only evidence of combustion being thepresence of coke showing oxidation rims. The distillation zone encompassedmost of the coal seam; different stages of carbonization were evidentin the samples from this zone, with a coke subzone occurring at the topand a precarbonization subzone at the base. Samples from the coke subzonesshow granular anisotropy; the reflectance and bireflectance of mediumgrained mosaic are higher than those measured on fine grained mosaicin the same samples from this zone. An unaltered coal zone occurred atthe base of the coal seam. 18 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
