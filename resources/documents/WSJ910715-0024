Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last year to sixsecurities-related felonies and was sentenced to 10 years inprison. Mr. Dershowitz, a professor at Harvard Law School,said Susan Estrich and Harvey Silverglate, attorneys withwhom he often works, are joining him on the case.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dershowitz, who will continue to work with theexisting Milken legal team headed by Arthur Liman, said, &quot;Asusual, my focus is on the civil liberties issues in the case.I am heartened by the recent series of reversals in the otherWall Street cases. I am exploring, among other things, theirimplications for both the civil and criminal cases involvingMichael Milken.&quot;   Lawyers familiar with the case say one civil libertiesissue may be alleged government intimidation of defensewitnesses who might have testified on Mr. Milken's behalf.   Among the options available to Mr. Dershowitz, accordingto lawyers familiar with the case, are an appeal of thesentence and the introduction of new evidence suggesting thatMr. Milken did not commit some of the crimes of which he wasaccused. In an earlier interview, Mr. Silverglate suggestedthat the new lawyers might consider withdrawing Mr. Milken'sguilty plea, but the Milken team is now understood toconsider that approach unworkable.   Mr. Milken, the former head of Drexel Burnham LambertInc.'s high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bond department, isserving his sentence at a prison camp in Pleasanton, Calif.Mr. Milken and his lawyers were understood to have beenencouraged by the reversal last week by the Second CircuitCourt of Appeals of the conviction of of stock trader JohnMulheren Jr., finding that the government hadn't proved thatMr. Mulheren illegally aided takeover-stock speculator IvanBoesky in some stock transactions.   The Mulheren decision was the latest in a string ofsetbacks delivered in recent months by the Second Circuitcourt to white collar-crime cases brought by the U.S.Attorney's office in Manhattan. Some defense lawyers havesaid the reversals represent a repudiation of the tacticsused by former U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who broughtthe original indictment against Mr. Milken. Mr. Giuliani hassaid the reversals occurred largely because of reasons beyondhis control, such as errors by judges.   Mr. Boesky, the central figure in the Wall Street scandal,pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutorsagainst Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Milken and others. Of the sixcounts to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty, four stem fromdealings with Mr. Boesky.   Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last year and agreed tocooperate with prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood,who sentenced Mr. Milken, said she would consider reducinghis sentence if he provides valuable help to prosecutors intheir continuing investigation of Wall Street. Mr. Milkenagreed to his plea bargain after the government threatened tobring a massive racketeering indictment against him includingcharges of insider trading, bribery and cheating customers.   According to defense attorneys, procedurally Mr. Milkenhas several options if he chooses to challenge thegovernment's case at this stage. He could seek a lowersentence on the basis of his cooperation, as Judge Wood hassaid she'll consider; he could appeal the sentence outright;or he could seek to vacate the guilty plea, which seems theleast likely.   Lawyers also say Mr. Milken's attorneys could ask JudgeWood to reopen a presentencing hearing held last fall toallow the government to present additional allegationsagainst Mr. Milken for consideration by the judge indetermining his sentence. The attorneys could seek to refutethe new allegations of wrongdoing that emerged at thehearing.   Mr. Milken also faces civil suits by investors, thriftregulators and former Drexel clients seeking to recoverlosses he allegedly caused.   Mr. Liman couldn't be reached for comment on Mr.Dershowitz's role in the case. Martin Flumenbaum, Mr. Liman'spartner on the case, declined to comment. Mr. Dershowitzsaid, &quot;I am honored to be working along with Arthur Liman andhis legal team. . . . We have been conferring together on thecase and see eye to eye on what has to be done.&quot;   Jess Fardella, an assistant U.S. Attorney on the Milkencase, declined to comment.   Mr. Dershowitz's co-counsels, Mr. Silverglate and Ms.Estrich, also worked with Mr. Dershowitz on the thesuccessful appeal of the murder conviction of Claus von Bulowand the appeal of Leona Helmsley's tax-evasion conviction.The federal appeals court in Manhattan is expected to issueits decision on Mrs. Helmsley's appeal soon. Ms. Estrichserved as campaign manager for former Democratic presidentialcandidate Michael Dukakis.</TEXT></DOC>
