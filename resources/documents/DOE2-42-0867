<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0867 </DOCNO><TEXT>Optical spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, and e.s.r. have been usedto study the behaviour of Cs/sub 2/[TcNCl/sub 5/] in aqueous HCl solutions.In 5.6 mol dm/sup -3/ HCl the predominant species is the [TcNCl/sub 4/]/sup-/ anion possibly with H/sub 2/O weakly bound trans to the N atom. Additionof 1 volume of H/sub 2/O to Cs/sub 2/[TcNCl/sub 5/] followed by 2 volumesof 5 mol dm/sup -3/ HCl gives a deep blue species, which is convertedto [TcNCl/sub 4/]/sup -/ on standing. Cs/sub 2/[TcNCl/sub 5/] dissolvedin 0.5 mol dm/sup -3/ HCl gives a pink solution which is stable overseveral days. The magnetic susceptibility and e.s.r. measurements indicatethat the blue and pink species are diamagnetic. Possible structures ofthe diamagnetic species are discussed by analogy to the behaviour of[MOX/sub 5/]sup(n-) in solutions of varying acidity.</TEXT></DOC>
