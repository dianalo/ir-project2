 The term groupware strikes aresponsive chord--the realization that we're at a point where we need to usecomputers as tools to promote teamwork and thereby increase productivity.andO;There's less consensus about exactly what groupware is, what it can do, andhow well it does it.andM;In fact, we know very little about groups themselves.andP;  Basic research hasstill not answered the fundamental question: How do people work together?andM;This lack of information has not kept software developers from introducinggroupware programs, however.andP;  The overall goal of these programs is to help agroup work together more efficiently.andP;  How each program tries to accomplishthis objective varies widely.andP;  There are programs that help form a group,focus its attention, assign tasks, structure those tasks, record progress,and so on.andP;  At the broadest level, groupware is software--and if necessary,hardware support--for people who work together.andM;That's a far cry from the origins of the personal computer.andP;  When themicrocomputer began to invade the business world in the early 1980s, itwasn't called the personal computer for nothing.andP;  As the industry endlesslyreminded us, the whole point of the personal computer was that it wrestedaway the power hitherto hogged by the mainframe priesthood and gave it to thelone user.andP;  Over time, the actual autonomy of the PC has been drasticallyaltered by local area networks, or LANs.andP;  But the notion of the hardyindividual user plugging productively away at his or her personal task hasremained.andM;In fact, from the proliferation of PCs, one would guess that whatbusinesspeople do all day is process words or crunch numbers.andP;  The truth isthat most office workers still spend a huge chunk of their time interactingnot with machines but with other people.andP;  According to one recent study doneat the Wharton Center for Applied Research, the typical senior manager spends23 hours a week in meetings alone.andM;If anything, the trend toward group work is increasing.andP;  That's due to theintroduction of Japanese-style management techniques and what businesscommentator Peter Drucker described in the January/February 1988 issue of theHarvard Business Review as &quot;the new organization,&quot; with its emphasis oninformation-based businesses and nonhierarchical teams of task-orientedspecialists.andP;  At the same time, the microcomputer has made it possible forincreasing numbers of people to work at home or on the road--a situation thatshould create a demand for new ways to communicate with the rest of the workgroup.andM;MORE THAN NETWORKINGandM;The PC may be the technology of choice for individual work, but ithasn't--with the possible exception of electronic mail (E-mail)--made much ofa dent on the work of groups.andP;  Not surprisingly, the PC industry would liketo step into the breach and give all those LANs something to do besides servefiles and share laser printers.andP;  Groupware is the answer.andP;  But groupwareisn't simply networking, and it isn't just a bunch of people who all happento be using their laptops at the same meeting.andM;Paul Saffo, a research fellow at the Institute for the Future (an independentresearch group, based in Menlo Park, Calif., that assesses emerginginformation technologies), makes a useful distinction.andP;  While many productscan be used by groups, he says, true groupware is &quot;like a telephone--it canbe used effectively only by two or more people.&quot;andP;  Beyond that definition, itmay be helpful to divide groupware into two categories.andM;What might be called first-generation groupware consists of products thatwork primarily by giving people access to each other's documents.andP;  Theyinclude editing programs like Broderbund's ForComment and, for the Macintosh,Mainstay's Markup.andP;  These let all members of a group enter comments orrevisions on a document written by one member, while the program retains theoriginal document in a file.andM;Other products in this first-generation category might be called electronicmemo pads.andP;  They include such programs as Data Access's Office Works, ImagineSoftware's Perfect Timing for the Macintosh, WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfectOffice, and Enable Software's Higgins.andP;  These packages offer tools such asE-mail, on-line address and phone books, document filing systems, and&quot;calendaring,&quot; which lets the computer look at group members' individualschedules and suggest the most convenient time for meetings.andM;Except for calendaring, first-generation groupware provides nothing thatremotely resembles artificial intelligence.andP;  ForComment doesn't edit yourarticles; it simply provides the medium for them to be edited.andP;  This productand other first-generation groupware programs in effect do nothing more thantake the place of paper, although their proponents would argue that they'reneater and more efficient.andM;BECOMING AN ACTIVE PLAYERandM;The next generation of groupware consists of products whose purpose is farless transparent.andP;  In fact, they aim to transcend their role as the medium inwhich the group works and become an integral part of the group's dynamics.andO;They are more like second lieutenants who actively organize not only what youdo but how you do it.andM;A position statement from the maker of Syzygy, one of the second-generationprograms, clearly indicates that a greater degree of managerial control iswhat distinguishes its product from the electronic memo pads: &quot;What good doesit do to have all your to-do lists and calendars neatly organized if whatyou're doing has little bearing on corporate objectives?andP;  [Some programs] caneasily lead to elaborate ritualistic systems for managing individual or groupinformation that becomes increasingly isolated from management concerns.andP;  Thekey [question is]: Does the software give managers more control, or take itaway?&quot;andM;It's true that sometimes groupware programs are designed to control rigidlythe way a group works.andP;  For example, some people have called ActionTechnologies' The Coordinator &quot;fascist software&quot; because it makes users adoptnot just a method of communicating with each other but an entire philosophyof communication.andP;  That thrust was obvious in the program's jargon-ladenfirst version.andM;At the heart of the program, which also includes E-mail and scheduling, is afeature known as &quot;conversation management.&quot;andP;   The program allows the senderto designate each communication as belonging to one of seven categories: aquestion, an offer, a request, a promise, a what-if speculation, a simplenote, or information.andP;  The program requires that you answer messages,automatically acknowledges receipts, and files all correspondence in ameaningful way.andP;  You can turn on your computer and get a list of whateveryone else on the team has already committed to have done for you bytoday.andP;  You'll also have a list of who hasn't answered your requests, and youcan trace all your correspondence with any individual.andM;The Coordinator helps diminish the time and effort spent managing projects.andO;It acts as a zealously organized manager might, making everyone accountableby keeping tabs on the status of each individual's tasks in a given projectand ensuring that no details are lost.andM;The program is one of the most successful groupware entries, with aninstalled base of more than 50,000 users.andP;  It was designed by FernandoFlores, a former Chilean finance minister with an interdisciplinary Ph.D.andO;from the University of California at Berkeley (his thesis was oncommunication and management in the office of the future).andP;  ActionTechnologies' chief systems architect is Flores' longtime associate, thenoted Stanford University Associate Professor of Computer Science TerryWinograd.andM;A less overtly ideological program is Information Research Corp.'s Syzygy.andO;According to Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the word, pronouncedSIZZ-a-gee, means &quot;the nearly straight-line configuration of three celestialbodies (as the sun, moon, and earth during a solar or lunar eclipse) in agravitational system.&quot; Officially launched at last fall's Comdex, the programis now completing beta testing.andM;Unlike The Coordinator, Syzygy uses familiar-looking forms and templates,which can be customized by users, to structure group interaction from the topdown.andP;  The program includes scheduling and to-do lists for groups andindividuals; hierarchical activity lists for delegating work, settingdeadlines, and assigning budgets and priorities for every tasks; andmultilevel Gantt charts that display project-schedule information by the day,week, or month.andP;  The Gantt charts, in Information Research's words, let you&quot;see the big picture of every project&quot; or &quot;zoom in to ride herd on specifictasks that are holding up major projects, instantly pinpoint[ing] who'sresponsible and what they're working on.&quot;andM;Yet another new program, SwixTech's SuperSync, is a completely differentbreed.andP;  Billing itself as &quot;team dynamics software,&quot; it promises to helpmanagers choose teams of individuals who will work well together and to breakup unproductive cliques and ferret out troublemakers on existing teams.andM;SuperSync was designed by Anthony Adams, who for many years ran a landscapearchitecture business in Tucson.andP;  &quot;One of the most frustrating parts ofrunning a business is that there can be some conflict in a group that youdon't even know about and that has nothing to do with the job,&quot; says Adams.andO;&quot;Then you turn around and find that because of this conflict, someone youhired has quit and gone to work for your competitors and become the star oftheir show.&quot;andM;A second formative experience for Adams was working for five years in theMiddle East with workers from many cultures.andP;  &quot;It wasn't always easy tounderstand how people were relating to one another,&quot; says Adams.andP;  &quot;But thisis an area that American companies will have to pay more and more attentionto as they expand internationally.&quot;andM;SuperSync asks team members a battery of questions, which can be customizedby the manager.andP;  The questions might ask employees who among their coworkersis the best informed, the most popular, or the one who would be their firstchoice for a working partner if they were given a new and unfamiliarassignment.andP;  The program assumes that their answers are truthful.andP;  Adams saysthat's not a problem, since &quot;all but maybe 2% to 5% of people really are keento know how they fit into the group and make the team better.&quot;andP;  While you canfool the boss, says Adams, &quot;you usually can't fool your peers.&quot; SuperSynctabulates the responses and produces a dazzling display of charts showing thestrengths of all the team members and their relationships with each other.andM;SALES ARE SLOWandM;The real question about groupware is, Does it work?andP;  The answer: It may betoo early to tell.andP;  As a whole, groupware products aren't selling all thatwell.andP;  And although there are some satisfied customers for those productsthat have been out for a while, the few independent researchers who arestudying the field have plenty of doubts, as we shall see.andP;  They say that, atbest, groupware is being used right now as glorified E-mail rather than as aquantum leap into new teamwork tools.andP;  Indeed, finding people who use all ofthe available bells and whistles beyond E-mail, says researcher Paul Saffo,&quot;is sort of like finding the subject of that story about the woman who puther dog in the microwave.andP;  Everybody knows about her, but how many peoplehave tracked her down?&quot;andM;So maybe the question to ask is, Is it worthwhile to use groupware merely asE-mail?andM;One customer who answers with a resounding yest is Ken Nickerson, manager ofinformation technology at Rogers Communications, a Toronto-based company withinterests in cable television, cellular phones, radio, network services, andother media operations.andP;  Some 200 Rogers employees across Canada have beenworking together for more than a year through The Coordinator.andP;  Although fewof them use the scheduling feature, they use the conversation-managementfeature to the tune of more than 5,000 messages a month to track numerousprojects.andM;Nickerson says the program has changed the way people work.andP;  &quot;The biggestchange was that we were able to get more people involved and bring moreexpertise to a decision,&quot; he says.andP;  In the past, the company might havethought twice before if flew people in from Vancouver for a meeting.andP;  &quot;Now,&quot;he says, &quot;you might have three people making the decision, but they have thebenefit of twenty other people living input.&quot;andM;IT'S A LITTLE SCARYandM;The input, moreover, is well documented.andP;  &quot;We print it out, it's permanent,and it can referenced,&quot; says Nickerson.andP;   &quot;That's a little scary, but itmakes you communicate differently and better.&quot;andM;Paradoxically, Nickerson finds that communicating is also easier.andP;  &quot;You gofor brevity,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Just yesterday I sent to the vice president ofoperations a memo that, in the past, I would have spent a lot of time beingmeticulous about--making sure I had the right letterhead and checking thegrammar 50 times.andP;  But last night I sent it from home, just like that.andP;  Youtend to 'talk' as you would on the phone--less formally, far more friendly,directly to the point, and 100% action oriented, with a lot less bull.&quot;andM;Another change is that people are bringing home more of their work.andO;&quot;Employees who used to be watching TV are now sitting at the laptop,hammering out a few messages,&quot; Nickerson says.andP;  The result is that there arefar fewer meetings.andP;  When the company does have them, Nickerson says, they'reno longer information meetings because that's been taken care of; they'reaction meetings.andP;  &quot;The feeling is, Let's have no more show-and-tell; let's doit.&quot;andM;Nickelson says the only downside his company has found in using TheCoordinator is an information glut--a tendency for managers, especially, tofeel that if messages are there, they are there to be read.andP;  &quot;People sendcopies of everything,&quot; Nickerson says, &quot;and it can get to be too much.&quot;andP;  Buthe sees this problem as a flaw with The Coordinator rather than withgroupware in general.andP;  He'd like to see something comparable to an executiveflipping through a newspaper.andP;  &quot;I want to be able to do that with E-mail,&quot; hesays, &quot;that is, use keywords to read what I want to read and have the rest onfile.&quot;andP;  Nickerson's wish list also includes a way to embed voice mail insideE-mail.andM;Fancy features require a sturdy hardware platform with a highly intuitiveuser interface.andP;  Indeed, several software companies with unreleasedPC-groupware programs, such as Lotus Development Corp.'s Notes andCoordination Technology's CTI, are apparently electing not to use Microsoft'sWindows environment and are holding out for more memory under OS/2 andPresentation Manager.andP;  The Macintosh IIx and, in particular, Steve Jobs'sNext machine are also seen as future groupware platforms.andM;WHAT MAKES GOOD GROUPS?andM;But some observers feel that hardware is the least of groupware's problems.andM;According to Christine Bullen, assistant director of the Center forInformation Research Systems at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT)Sloan School of Management, groupware is being designed without muchunderstanding of how groups actually work.andP;  Indeed, Bullen adds, there isn'tmuch research on how groups work.andP;  In contrast, the software designers ofdecision-support software had a lot to go on, she says.andP;  They studied howindividuals make decisions and used this information to influence theirsoftware design.andP;  That information base doesn't exist for groupware design.andO;Says Bullen: &quot;We really don't know what makes good groups or bad groups.&quot;andM;Bullen, who has worked in the teleconferencing field for a decade, iscurrently studying some 20 companies across the country that have installedHiggins, The Coordinator, ForComment, and other groupware programs.andP;  The newsisn't good.andM;For starters, there is worker resistance.andP;  People don't like to change theirwork habits unless they perceive a real benefit.andP;  Only in unique worksituations that require it do people experiment with new technology.andP;  &quot;Infamiliar, ongoing situations in which they're not under pressure,&quot; Bullensays, &quot;people like to work the way they are used to working, and the benefitsof learning a new way aren't so obvious.andP;  That's just human nature.&quot;andM;The same thing was said about computers five or ten years ago, and plenty oftechnophobes were eventually won over.andP;  But, according to Bullen, even thosewho think they like groupware often aren't using it effectively--anindication that the products aren't addressing real needs.andM;Take electronic calendaring, for example.andP;  It really changes the way youwork, Bullen notes.andP;  It takes group commitment and group permission to say,&quot;Do this horrible thing to us.&quot;andP;  Electronic calendaring isn't a matter ofjust a record of a date and time you have to be some-place--it's a matter ofwhether you're willing to have your life scheduled by someone else, she says.andO;The same problem holds with project tracking.andP;  &quot;You're asking the whole groupto commit to look at things in a way they haven't before.&quot;andM;Groupware, especially the second generation, almost by definition comes withits own agenda, since it makes implicit assumptions about what kinds of groupactivities are worthwhile and what assistance groups need in performing them.andO;For instance, the philosophy behind The Coordinator assumes that groups needrigid structure and explicit terms with which to think about their work.andM;Some other programs may not arrive at the workplace with such an articulatedphilosophy, but they do reflect values.andP;  For instance, Syzygy and SuperSyncmay fall under the groupware rubric, but they're not really aimed at thenonhierarchical teams of Peter Drucker's &quot;new organization.&quot;andP;  They areexplicitly geared to top-down managers intent on cracking the whip andcutting out the deadwood.andP;  When groupware meets resistance in the workplace,it might be because of its values, not its inherent potential as aproductivity tool.andM;Very different groupware is currently coming out of Scandinavia, according toformer MIT Assistant Professor Irene Greif, now with Lotus Development Corp.andO;and editor of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work: A Book of Readings (MorganKaufmann Publishers, 1988).andP;  Greif chaired the 1988 Conference onComputer-Supported Cooperative Work last fall in Portland, Oreg., whereScandinavian researchers submitted five of the thirty papers underdiscussion.andM;In Scandinavia, Greif says, the philosophy underlying all new groupware iscooperation.andP;  Unions have a strong say about how technology is brought intoorganizations and even how it's designed.andP;  &quot;There's a real emphasis onbringing in those who use the software and a real synergy between designersand users,&quot; she says.andP;  &quot;Programs that would devalue people are rejected.&quot;andO;According to Greif, &quot;The question designers are asking users is, What kind oftools would enhance your work, not replace you?&quot;andM;Barbara Garson, author of The Electronic Sweatshop: How Computers areTransforming the Office of the Future into the Factory of the Past, says themonitoring made possible by groupware is used not only to find out how fasteach person is working at each moment, but also to prescribe exactly how eachworker should do his or her job.andP;  The question is, Does this give peopleenough freedom to perform their jobs the way they want?andP;  The classic example,says Garson, is sales.andP;  Salespeople have their own ways of getting sales, andthey don't necessarily want the boss to be in on it.andP;  Reporters are the sameway; maybe they don't want their editors to know how simple it was for themto get a particular story.andP;  Reporters also may not want their editors to knowhow many stupid mistakes they made.andP;  &quot;So what they end up doing,&quot; saysGarson, &quot;is keeping two sets of books or making things up after the fact, aslong as the results seem plausible--the same way people do with expenseaccounts.&quot;andM;The Institute for the Future's researcher Paul Saffo thinks groupware is&quot;less important as a product category than as a new spin on this thing wecall personal computing.&quot;andP;  An important question to ask, Saffo says, iswhether something is a good product, aside from the groupware dimension.andP;  Thereal trend is toward products that have the groupware dimension built inwhere it's needed--such as a version of Microsoft Word containing ForCommentfeatures.andM;BEYOND A TECHNICAL SOLUTIONandM;People should also question the assumption that just because a particulargroup task can be done on a computer, a computer therefore is the mechanismby which it should be done.andP;  According to MIT's Bullen, even wherecalendaring programs are designed to be as nonintrusive as possible (forinstance, allowing group members to keep their personal appointmentsconfidential), &quot;most people would rather use their Day-Timer, paper clips,and those little sticky things.&quot;andP;  She adds, &quot;I don't know how you could dothat technically and give people something they could still carry around withthem.&quot;andM;Roger Knake does use The Coordinator's calendar feature in his work at XitelInc., a software-development company in Berwyn, Pa.andP;  However, he admits heresisted it for a year and still carries a paper daybook.andP;  Knake, whocommunicates with sales staff all over the country, is also a fan of workingwithin groups that are connected electronically.andP;  Sending messageselectronically, he says, &quot;enables me to do more-structured thinking becauseit's conversational and because it's written.andP;  I used to type lengthyepistles; now I can get into chitchat mode.andP;  At the same time, because I'mdoing the typing, it makes me think, so it's a real good compromise.&quot;andP;  Theproblem for Knake is that he's become too enamored of the technology.andM;&quot;If you don't watch it, you'll get trapped,&quot; Knake says.andP;  &quot;Sometimes you endup writing when you need only pick up the phone and talk to someone.andP;  You getinto the habit of being very much to the point, so when you put things inwriting, you tend to ignore people's feelings.andP;  You don't see what happens tothem when they read your message.&quot;andM;Systems that combine technologies may be the wave of the future.andP;  One earlyentrant in the field is the Wang Freestyle personal computer system, whichcombines a computer, a printer, a facsimile card, a full-page tablet thatallows workers to enter handwritten notes into the computer, and atelephone-like handset that can simultaneously record voice comments.andP;  Aprinter and scanner are optional.andP;  Both handwritten and voice notes can besent to any other Freestyle user via Wang's VS office network.andP;  All this isnot cheap: Each workstation on the system costs nearly $12,000.andM;Sociologist Robert Johansen, who works at the Institute for the Future, isthe author of Groupware: Computer Support for Business Teams (The Free Press,1988).andP;  This and Greif's book are probably the Bible and Koran of thegroupware field.andP;  Johansen divides group work into four kinds: same time/sameplace (normal face-to-face meetings); same time/different place(teleconferencing); different time/same place (colleagues who work differentshifts but who need to communicate with each other); and differenttime/different place.andP;  Most of the groupware action in the short term,Johansen predicts, will happen in the different time/different placequadrant, where E-mail is already one of the best technologies available.andM;THE NEW 'HORSELESS CARRIAGE'andM;&quot;Groupware for same time/same place activity is difficult to sell,&quot; Johansenadds, &quot;because people don't want to spend a lot of money on high-techconference-room equipment.&quot;andP;  Any computer product would have to replace thefunctions of telephones, overhead projectors, scanners, and whiteboards.andP;  Theexception, according to Johansen, would be some undreamed-of future productthat goes beyond what he calls &quot;the horseless carriage&quot;--in other words,something that doesn't merely copy an existing function.andP;  For example, aproduct that makes a record of the meeting and inserts it into eachattendee's computer file might be a smash success.andM;Johansen cautions that &quot;there's been a lot of hype about groupware, sothere's bound to be a lot of disappointment.&quot;andP;  But, he adds, two basic forcesare driving groupware: First, millions of business teams need something tohelp them work together better.andP;  Second, the personal computer is toopersonal; it's gradually becoming the interpersonal computer.andM;According to Johansen, groupware is one of the few things that's developingin terms of user needs.andP;  &quot;Groupware,&quot; he says, &quot;will be oversold, and therewill be resistance to it.andP;  It will probably take five years for theseproducts to be used on a wide scale.andP;  But that's good news for the userbecause [by then] they'll be good products.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
