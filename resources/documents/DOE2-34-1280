<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-1280 </DOCNO><TEXT>A signal transmission system for communication among a central stationand a plurality of local stations located in towers of a power transmissionline uses an optical fiber cable included in an overhead ground wiresuspended on the towers between the central station and the local stations.A closed transmission loop is formed by such optical fiber cable foreffecting signal transmission from the central station to the local stationsand from the local stations to the central station. The arrangement hasthe advantage of enabling biodirectional communication between the centralstation and the local stations without the need of prior systems to increaseeither the number of converters or the transmission loss in the datatransmission paths. Each local station can transmit various measureddata, such as wind speed and direction, and can receive transmitted instructionsso that, for example, local apparatus such as television cameras canbe operated. 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
