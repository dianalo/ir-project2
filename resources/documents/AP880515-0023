The central bank's credit tightening moves have already promptedthe first increase in the prime rate in seven months and economistssaid they look for a variety of interest rates, including mortgagerates, to head higher in the weeks ahead.   Fed policy-makers will meet behind closed doors Tuesday toreview current monetary policy. Economists said this session of theFederal Open Market Committee has already been overshadowed by themove the central bank took last week to boost interest rates.   While the Fed, as usual, made no public announcement of theaction, the closely watched federal funds rate moved up one-fourthof a percentage point to 7[ percent last week. This rate, which isthe interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, is themost sensitive to moves by the central bank to make cash more orless readily available to the banking system.   Major banks followed suit, announcing Wednesday a boost in theirprime lending rate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent, the firstincrease in this benchmark lending rate since the stock marketcrash jolted Wall Street.   The prime rate is used to calculate loans to businesses as wellas to determine many types of consumer loans, including the popularhome equity loans.   The credit tightening by the Fed followed a report that theunemployment rate had fallen to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent inApril. It was the second move by the central bank in less than twomonths to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of dampeningeconomic activity to prevent a surge in inflation.   The Fed had also been tightening credit right before the Octoberstock market crash but switched quickly to an easier-money policyto keep the country from slipping into a recession.   But reports so far this year indicate that the economy sufferedfew ill effects from the crash. The overall economy grew at asurprisingly robust 2.3 percent annual rate from January throughMarch.   Many analysts believe the current jobless level means thecountry is nearing the range of full employment when tight labormarkets can start pushing up wages.   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said hebelieves a variety of signs shows the country is on the brink of around of higher inflation in which ``too many dollars are chasingtoo few goods.''   ``We have a strong economy pressing against capacity in both thelabor and production markets,'' he said. ``But it is early in theprocess, which suggests that there is perhaps still time for theFed to nip it in the bud.''   Other economists are not so sure that inflationary pressureshave begun to build. They note that wage demands have stillremained moderate and industry is operating at 82.3 percent ofcapacity, still below the 85 percent range thought to triggerinflation problems.   But analysts generally agreed that interest rates are headedhigher, pushed up not only by credit tightening by the central bankbut concern among banks and financial market investors that theyneed to demand a higher premium as a hedge against inflation.   Mortgage rates have been rising in recent weeks and now stand at10.4 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage, up from 9.82percent just two months ago.   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., predictedthat mortgage rates would hit 10.75 percent by mid-summer.   ``Inflation is accelerating,'' he said. ``No one knows for surewhere full employment is, but almost everybody would agree that 5.4percent is getting close.''   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said heexpected the central bank would like to keep policy unchanged toavoid drawing attention to its actions during a presidentialcampaign. But he said renewed pressure on the dollar would forcethe central bank to tighten further.   The Fed tightened slightly a month ago when an unexpectedly highU.S. trade deficit sent the dollar tumbling on foreign currencymarkets. The government is due to report the March trade report onTuesday.   ``If a bad trade report sends the dollar down, the Fed wouldhave to send another signal to the markets that it will defend theU.S. currency,'' Evans said.</TEXT></DOC>
