Under the legislation, a bank based elsewhere in New England could acquire a New Hampshire bank if most of the acquirer's deposits are in New England. Under a law enacted last year, all the deposits must be in New England. The state Senate earlier this year passed a similar bill, and is expected to agree to modifications contained in the House version. </TEXT></DOC>
