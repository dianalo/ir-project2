(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leroy Horn raises cattle and grows alfalfa athis rural central Nevada spread, but this year's harvesting isbeing done by hungry deer that have broken his fences, trampled theground and nibbled his hay.   Horn's ranch is one of scores in Nevada where thousands ofmarauding deer have found green fields tempting in this droughtyear. A special hunting season has been called to thin their recordnumbers.   ``The deer come and mow the alfalfa down,'' Horn said Monday.``I've got 35 acres but they just eat it as fast as it grows.   ``Every year it seems like a few more deer come back.''   The Nevada Department of Wildlife has come to the rescue bycalling an emergency early hunting season to trim the state'srecord 250,000 deer herd.   Twenty antlerless deer tags will go on sale for the area whereHorn lives beginning Wednesday with 170 to 200 more available inother rural areas to control the deer depredation, officials said.The permits will be good for about two weeks.   Additional hunts are likely before the normal October throughDecember hunting season, said David Rice, a department spokesman.   ``This isn't the first time we've had emergency depredationhunts,'' Rice said. ``But this is pretty bad this year because wehave a record deer population.''   The number of deer is the largest since records began in theearly 1960s, Rice said.   Opening the hunting season early and in specific problem areasis the best way to reduce the deer population when it intrudes onranchers and farmers, he said.   Even so, Horn said he doesn't plan to kill a deer. ``I'll leavethat up to the hunters.''</TEXT></DOC>
