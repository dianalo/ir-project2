(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former aide to PTL founder Jim Bakkertestified in court today that the evangelist gave him the authorityto take large cash advances and use ministry credit cards.   David Taggart and his brother, James, are charged with evading$525,000 in federal income taxes while associated with PTL.   Under questioning by defense lawyer Ben Cotten, David Taggartsaid that as a vice president of the ministry, he had directauthority from Bakker to take large cash advances, sign PTL checks,use PTL credit cards and authorize bonuses for PTL employees.   Taggart said he gained the authority when Bakker and his wife,Tammy, lured him back to the ministry after a brief absence heattributed to exhaustion.   The cash advances, Taggart said, were used primarily for trips bythe Bakkers on ministry business. He claimed that money used forpersonal expenses was reimbursed, but said, ``I always have been laxabout documentation. It's never been a priority.''   Taggart's testimony came a day after Bakker invoked his FifthAmendment right against self-incrimination in refusing to answerquestions by defense and prosecuting attorneys. Bakker's 10-minuteappearance in the federal courtroom was without the presence of thejury.   ``When his trial comes about, there will be no taking of theFifth Amendment and no refusal to answer any questions that thegovernment cares to ask and to go into the entire matter in depth,''said Bakker attorney George T. Davis.   Bakker and former top PTL aide Richard Dortch are scheduled to goon trial for conspiracy and wire and mail fraud on Aug. 28.   After Bakker refused to answer questions, Judge Robert Potterreleased the witness, saying, ``This court will not force him totestify.''   Cotten said he is barred from mentioning to the jury that Bakkerever appeared in court.   James Taggart took the stand Wednesday and described hisassociation with Bakker.   Both Taggarts were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at thetelevision ministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987following revelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
