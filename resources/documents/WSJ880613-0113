In its lust to destroy executive-branch powers, Congress plans to insert a provision that would make the entire agreement unconstitutional.    The dispute is over what sounds like an arcane issue: How will decisions on violations reached by a joint U.S.-Canadian panel become part of U.S. law? Or: Can the U.S. hand over the power to control domestic U.S. policy to foreigners? The answer is obviously no, not that Congress cares.    Under the trade agreement, the U.S. and Canadian governments will each appoint half the members of the panel that will patrol compliance. As with other international bodies, the group's decisions on trade violations will bind the U.S. as a matter of international law. The issue is how these decisions become part of U.S. law so that violators can be punished.    The problem is that while the U.S. would be bound by international law to adhere to the panel's decisions, the U.S. government can't be required to implement these decisions as a matter of U.S. law. For these decisions to be automatically binding, members of the panel would have to be &quot;officers of the U.S.,&quot; appointed by the President. This is the meaning of the now-famous Appointments Clause, which the Supreme Court used to invalidate Gramm-Rudman on the ground that the comptroller general is not an executive-branch officer. Neither are the Canadian panel members.    The Justice Department urged Congress to change the provision to fix this technical but important problem. The first offender under the agreement would try to wriggle out of any fines or punishment by arguing that this provision makes the agreement unconstitutional. The best way is for Congress simply to acknowledge the Constitution by authorizing the President to apply the panel's decisions to U.S. law by passing them on to the International Trade Commission and Commerce Department.    This constitutional issue worries the Canadians. Without taking sides with either Congress or the President, Ambassador Allan Gotlieb told us that &quot;we would be profoundly concerned if the net result of U.S. legal constraints is that panel decisions cannot be implemented under U.S. law.&quot; A less diplomatic way of putting it is that if American violators can't be punished, the trade agreement will be dead.    Senate negotiators last week tried to persuade the House to at least include a fallback provision that would fix the problem in case Justice is right and the agreement is found unconstitutional. So far, Rep. Robert Kastenmeier refuses even this muddling solution. He'd sacrifice free trade and the Constitution in this power play for direct congressional control over the ITC and Commerce.    The irony is that Congress has wide powers under the Constitution to regulate international commerce and set tariffs. If it had the political will to take responsibility for the results, Congress could pass new legislation giving it complete control over trade. But congressmen understand perfectly well that the President must remain the key to trade policy.    The goal must be to make this free-trade agreement as binding on both sides as possible before it takes effect. Congress must make sure that U.S. violators can't get off simply by enforcing the Constitution. </TEXT></DOC>
