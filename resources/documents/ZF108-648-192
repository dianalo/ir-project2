Beta testers passed on the information, and theyshould account for their actions.andP;  I cannot understand how a reporter couldeither mitigate or extenuate that fact.andP;  Beta testers made and broke theagreements.andP;  They are accountable not only to themselves and to individualswith whom they had agreements, but to you and me for degeneration in thesoftware publication circuit.andM;The act of violating a nondisclosure agreement (giving proprietaryinformation to unauthorized people) is no different from what john Walker didwhen he gave away our secrets to other governments.andP;  Both Walker and thebetas compromise information they have agreed to protect.andP;  Betas who violatethese nondisclosure agreements are the true Walker-like villains who disruptthe norm with furtive misdeeds.andP;  The people who commit these acts operatefrom behind a curtain of anonymity and never sign their names to theirtreachery.andM;While we search for various solutions, these unscrupulous miscreants willsnicker at our efforts from their darkened rooms or cluck in a gaggle ofother betrayers and informants, slapping each other on the back, basking inthe security that accompanies invisibility.andP;  It is indeed sad that theactions of a few can slow down the entire software industry, an industry thathas become vital to our way of life.andM;The acts of these mini-Walkers affect all of us.andP;  It is, therefore, up to us(the people who judge, with our words and actions, the actions of others asbeing wrong) to protect the software industry's testing program.andP;  Some of usknow one or more of these agreement violators and have just never doneanything about it.andP;  The problem will not be solved until we let the violatorsknow that we think what they do is despicable, that we won't do business withthem anymore, that we encourage the software companies to drop identifiedviolators as beta testers, and anything else that will make them stop theirperfidy, the problem will not be solved.andM;Let's save our betas.andP;  But let's do it by weeding out the bad ones.andP;  To solvethis dilemma, we have to treat those who are causing these problems for whatthey truly are: unprincipled people performing despicable acts.andP;  It really isup to us to remedy this problem.andM;Joe CloutierandM;Yates Center, Kan.andM;THAT'S ONE EXPENSIVE PLUMBER !andP;  Dear Editor:andM;Thanks a million for &quot;Save our betas&quot;! It's sad when computer magazines turnto tabloid journalism.andP;  Auto and computer hardware manufacturers don't usebeta testers, which leads me to believe that the software industry is uniquein this respect.andM;When I sign a nondisclosure agreement, I expect to be bound by it bothlegally and morally.andP;  Software vendors have an absolute right to demand thatI protect their property.andM;One very large vendor (who shall remain nameless) includes a prima faciedamages clause making breach of the nondisclosure worth $ 10,000 peroccurrence! My first reaction was hesitation, but then I thought, &quot;No ...andO;this is important to me, and the protection of the vendors' rights isimportant to them.andP;  I have no intention of deliberately breaching thisagreement, and I doubt that an unavoidable, accidental breach would have mehauled into court.&quot;andM;I wouldn't have breached the agreement in the first place, nor would I breachany such agreement, but I think a clause like this might shut off a fewfaucets.andP;  I, for one, would have no problem signing.andM;Using proprietary information does not promote the best interests of thisindustry, and I find it both legally and morally reprehensible that a betatester would divulge the information or that a &quot;professional&quot; magazine woulduse it.andM;Bud AaronandM;Oceanside, Calif.andM;Thanks to everyone who responded to &quot;Save our betas.andP;  &quot; The editorial evokedstrong feelings, and everyone is entitled to an opinion.andP;  I won't try tochange anyone's mind, but I would like to clarify one point.andP;  I don't see myproposal-that the weekly newspapers covering our industry stop publishinganonymous stories from beta testers who violate their nondisclosureagreements as a First Amendment issue.andP;  I support the newspapers'constitutional light to publish the stories.andM;What I don't support is their editorial judgment.andP;  COMPUTER LANGUAGE couldfill each issue with fashion guides and quiche recipes, but it wouldn't matchreaders' needs.andP;  It would be constitutionally protected free speech, but Itwould be irresponsible.andM;Similarly, the weeklies could continue to badger beta testers into violatingnondisclosure agreements and publish their anonymous quotes about prereleasesoftware development tools.andP;  It is constitutionally protected free speech.andO;But (for reasons I won't reiterate) I think it's irresponsible.andM;Ed.andM;OUR PEERS' OPPOSING POWERandM;Dear Editor:andM;License programmers? Instead of licenses, we need meaningful quality control.andO;Our testing methods are laughable.andP;  We need real adversaries in the testingprocess who are programmers, who have our source code, and whose mission inlife is to refute our efforts.andP;  The expense of adding adversarial testing tothe development project is an investment in quality.andP;  I think it's possibleto save money with such an approach.andM;Critical review is part of science, philosophy, law, and the Ada project.andO;Programmers have hidden from it long enough behind such wimpy surrogates as&quot;structured walkthroughs&quot; and &quot;beta testing.&quot;andM;Exposing code to the acid test of peer review makes more sense than examiningthe programmer for correctness.andP;  If passing tests indicated anything, allcomputer science graduates would be whiz programmers and all public employeeswould be competent, hardworking, and sincere.andP;  I am suspicious of asking thegovernment to do something for us that it has not succeeded in doing foritself.andM;Chuck MarshandM;Monroeville, Pa.andM;APRIL FOOL !andP;  Dear Editor:andM;If the cover of the April issue is a fair sample of your taste and talent forcover pictures, please just leave them off and print the table of contents onthe cover in the future.andM;David BurnsandM;Cambridge, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
