On theother hand the observed decrease of ozone in the antarctic in springand at the beginning of summer time may increase the UV-part of solarradiation which reaches earth surface. In this report a discussion isgiven how ozone is formed in the high altitudes and which chemical reactionsmay destroy it in the stratosphere. It can be shown that probably fluorine-chlorine-carbon-compoundswill have the main influence of the destruction of ozone. A short descriptionis also added to describe the daily and annual changes of ozone concentrationon earth surface.</TEXT></DOC>
