Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><GV>LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department today plans to announceits first proposed requirements for motor-vehicle safety onthe job.   The proposal, which would cover some 5.4 million employersand 35 million workers, will take the department'sOccupational Safety and Health Administration beyond itsusual regulatory realm, largely reflecting OSHA chief GerardScannell's zeal for tackling new areas.</LP><TEXT>   It would mandate that employers require employees tobuckle safety belts in salesmen's cars, trucks, and othervehicles equipped with belts; require motorcycle-deliverypeople to use safety helmets; and set up training programs toenhance certain aspects of safe vehicle operation. The ruleswould apply to such jobs as salesmen and service people.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has also seized on the planas a way to promote transportation-related safety. That's anarea in which she made a mark as transportation secretary sixyears ago when she promulgated rules that led to widespreadstate laws requiring auto safety belts to be buckled up. Therules also led to current auto-industry moves to equip newcars with automatically inflating air bags or so-calledautomatically fastening &quot;passive seatbelts.&quot;   She in fact picked today, the sixth anniversary of therule for belt laws and passive restraints, to announce thenew OSHA vehicle-safety push.   Mrs. Dole said in an interview that the passive-restraintrule she issued in 1984 was a &quot;necessary foundation&quot; for thenew OSHA rule proposal. Since 1984, nationwide seatbelt usehas climbed to 46% from 14%, she said. She and Mr. Scannellagreed early last year to push for the new federal standards.Mr. Scannell instituted a similar program when he was safetydirector at Johnson andamp; Johnson and chairman of the NationalSafety Council's motor-vehicle safety committee.   For both officials, the initiative is venturesome. JohnPendergrass, Mr. Scannell's predecessor as OSHA chief, hadrejected an NSC petition for such requirements, and insistedthat OSHA lacked authority to issue them.   Mrs. Dole said she has had a much easier job persuadingthe White House Office of Management and Budget to accept thenew proposal than she had in trying to &quot;break through thepalace guard&quot; to persuade President Reagan and his OMB andother White House staffers on the air-bag rule. While topWhite House aides wanted to scrap any air-bag requirement in1984, she reminded them that the Supreme Court had ruled theReagan administration's earlier rescinding of the requirementto be illegal.   Now, she said, &quot;it's a different climate&quot; in the country.This time, by contrast, the OMB not only went for theworkplace motor-vehicle idea, but even buttressed it byhelping insert the motorcycle-helmet requirement after OSHAhad gingerly raised the question, she and OSHA officialssaid.   The OMB cited a Louisiana study showing that reinstatementof the state's motorcycle-helmet law cut cyclist deathssharply. The issue has been controversial for many years,with conservatives saying cyclists shouldn't be forced to usehelmets if they don't want to.   Mrs. Dole and OSHA noted that motor-vehicle accidents arethe largest single cause of workplace fatalities, accountingfor 36.5% of occupational deaths, with about 2,100 workermotor-vehicle fatalities and 91,000 injuries resulting inlost workdays a year. The rule will save more lives than allother OSHA safety rules issued in the past decade combined,Mrs. Dole said.   OSHA estimated that the proposed rule will save between465 and 684 lives and prevent between 22,221 and 31,635injuries annually, while costing employers $221 million ayear.   While some companies such as Johnson andamp; Johnson, Du PontCo. and United Parcel Service of America Inc. already haverather stringent worker motor-vehicle safety rules in effect,the proposed OSHA requirements would cover 90% of the sixmillion companies the agency regulates. The rule wouldembrace a wide range of vehicles, including cars used on thejob, forklift trucks, bulldozers, and many farm tractors,though some of these are already covered by OSHA standards,such as ones dealing with construction projects.   The proposal will also ask whether bicycles used on thejob, such as in making deliveries, should be covered, whethervehicles that are unsafe because of poor maintenance shouldbe addressed, whether OSHA should move to require air bags inworker-used cars; and whether vehicles without belts shouldhave to be refitted with belts.   OSHA is expected to take public comments on the proposalfor about 120 days. The agency also could decide to hold ahearing late this year or early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
