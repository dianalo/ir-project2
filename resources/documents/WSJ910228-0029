During the year, ICI earnings have been eroded byrecessions in three of four major markets: the U.K., U.S. andAustralia, with the exception being Canada, analysts note.The strength of sterling against the U.S. and Australiandollar is cited as another reason for the profit slump,adversely affecting the translation of earnings from thosecountries.
