The decision came despite vocal protests at the NRC meeting from about 60 North Carolina citizens who oppose the plant.    The plant is 83.8%-owned by Carolina Power andamp; Light Co. and 16.2%-owned by North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. The owners said they are prepared to proceed to full-power generation as soon as the commission's staff is satisfied with low-power testing.    Separately, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, rejected an emergency request by a citizens group, Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, to block progress of Centerior Energy Corp.'s Perry, Ohio, nuclear plant toward full power. That plant already has a full-power license, despite claims by citizen groups claim that it is vulnerable to earthquakes and claims by Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste that its emergency planning is deficient.    Also, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati barred the U.S. Energy Department from moving to establish a monitored retrievable storage facility for high-level nuclear waste at Oak Ridge, Tenn. The court gave the state 30 days to appeal its bid to block the facility. Previously, a district court had blocked the project but an appeals panel overturned that ruling on procedural grounds. </TEXT></DOC>
