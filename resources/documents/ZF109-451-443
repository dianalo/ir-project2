(Fiber Distributed Data Interface; IndustryInsight) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Linde, Yoseph.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Users planning Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networkswill soon have an alternate choice in media.andP;  Fiber-optic cable,offering excellent noise immunity and link ranges of up to twokilometers for 100Mbps data, is also extremely expensive.andO;Additionally, twisted-pair wiring is quickly becoming the mediumof choice for Ethernet and token-ring networks.andP;  Thoughtwisted-pair lacks the noise immunity of fiber-optic cable and islimited to lengths of about 100 meters, it is being explored as amedium for FDDI networks, and some vendors already havetwisted-pair FDDI working in the laboratory.andP;  Steps are alreadybeing taken to standardize the solution.andP;  Benefits of being ableto use twisted-pair for FDDI include the availability of a single,low-cost medium to serve all networking standards and rapid growthof FDDI to the desktop, resulting in reduced cost of FDDIadapters.andP;  Problems that need to be resolved for twisted-pair FDDIto become practical include cable attenuation, federal emissionsrequirements, and the compactness of FDDI fiber-optictransceivers.andP;  Twisted-pair will be complementary to fiber-opticcable in FDDI networks.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Media QualityFiber Distributed Data Interface StandardFiber OpticsTwisted PairNetworksCables.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
