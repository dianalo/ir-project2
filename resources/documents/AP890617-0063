Evan Bayh, a Democrat.   Bayh noted that Indiana has already added drug-related murders tothe state's capital punishment statute.   In a speech Thursday to graduates of the Federal Law EnforcementTraining Academy in Glynco, Ga., Bush called on the nation'sgovernors to offer state-level support for three planks of hisanti-crime package.   The president has proposed doubling to 10 years the mandatoryprison term for using semi-automatic weapons in violent crimes,elimination of plea bargaining for federal firearms crimes and anexpanded death penalty.   ``When a criminal commits a crime with a gun and someone dies,justice demands something in return: the ultimate penalty, death,''Bush said.   ``I call on governors to match this federal initiative andpropose these same three standards at home: mandatory time, no dealswithout cooperation and the death penalty,'' he said.   Bush's proposed crime package that was formally submitted toCongress last week includes a 5 percent bonus in federal lawenforcement grants for states that adopt model legislation providingmandatory minimum sentences for firearms-related crimes.   North Carolina's Republican governor, Jim Martin, said he favoredmandatory prison time for criminals who use guns in violent ordrug-related crimes. But mandatory sentences for these criminalswould put even more strain on the state's crowded prisons, he noted.   ``The way we have to solve that is to build more prisons forthose who are involved in drug-related crimes so they can servetheir terms,'' he said.   ``They won't be selling drugs to society if we can keep themaway,'' Martin said.   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, a Republican who once served aschief federal prosecutor in Chicago, echoed Martin's concern aboutovercrowded prisons.'   ``The failure to have a sufficient prison space compelsprosecutors and judges to give to lenient deals to criminals. Thatencourages crime, not discourages it,'' Thompson said.   Thompson said he supported Bush's call for an expanded deathpenalty and added that the president's proposal in some ways``mirrors the kind of program that we have seen in Illinois for thelast 13 years.''   While plea bargaining is widely practiced, as it is in moststates, Illinois has mandatory prison sentences for a variety offelonies, including murder, attempted murder, sexual asault, armedrobbery and serious drug trafficking.   In a statement issued through a spokesman, Kentucky Gov. WallaceWilkinson, a Democrat, said he also supported the pillars of Bush'sprogram.   ``Our message has to be clear: more time for violent crime, nodeal to drug deals, the ultimate penalty for the ultimate crime.''   Kentucky, however, like most states, has no restrictions on pleabargaining and there are no mandatory prison sentences.   Limits on plea bargaining were not universally supported.   While he favors the concept of limiting plea bargaining, IowaGov. Terry Branstad, a Republican, says its not practical.   ``You've got to give prosecutors some flexibility, Obviouslysometimes they plea bargain because they don't think they could geta conviction on the higher offense.''   Branstad also said he didn't ``believe the death penalty is apanacea.''   The governor said he favors the death penalty for some, but notall cases. ``This may save some innocent victims from beingmurdered,'' Branstad said of his support for the death penalty forkidnapping and for killers of sex-abuse victims.   Iowa does not have a death penalty statute and it is not likelythat capital punishment would be enacted while Democrats control thelegislature.   In nearby Kansas, Gov. Mike Hayden, a Republican, said Bush'sproposals ``dovetail with what we are doing at the state level,especially in the area of drug trafficking.''   While Kansas does not have a death penalty, the state has anautomatic life sentence for first-degree murder. The law bars parolefor at least 15 years. Kansas also imposes mandatory sentences forfelonies committed with firearms.   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, a Republican, meanwhile, is planningto sign a bill that could result in the death penalty for defendantsconvicted of drug-related murders.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who lost to Bush in apresidential race last fall that featured GOP attacks on his state'sprison system, said the president's strategy is doomed to fail.   ``All these things have been tried,'' Dukakis said.   ``Unless we're serious about education and prevention andtreatment as well as effective enforcement... there's no sense inreinventing the wheel.''</TEXT></DOC>
