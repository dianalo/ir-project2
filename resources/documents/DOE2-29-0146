Short of virtuallycomplete, multilateral nuclear disarmament, however, no change in thepace, balance, or even the direction of the arms race can make much differencein the risk of nuclear war, the damage should one occur, or the divisionof international political power. This includes Star Wars, the nuclearfreeze, and even large cuts in or stabilization of offensive nucleararsenals. A better starting point for nuclear politics would be the insightthat nuclear weapons have completely changed the logic of power as ithas been handed down through the ages. Military force, perfected to itshighest level, has invalidated itself - for in a nuclearized world, anyresort to force by a nuclear power risks escalation to its ultimate level,and thus to oblivion for all. Trying to rationalize and control the ultimateforce is far less realistic and important than limiting the provocationof conflict and the use of force at lower, non-nuclear levels - by theUnited States, it clients, and, to the extent possible, its adversaries.13 references.</TEXT></DOC>
