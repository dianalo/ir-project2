Some 22.8% of native-born Americans aged 18 and over reported four or more days in the previous year when they were sick in bed for at least a half-day.    By comparison, only 18.8% of the foreign-born population said they had been sick four or more days in a year, according to the study, &quot;Health of the Foreign-Born Population: United States, 1985-86.&quot;    Several possible reasons could account for the difference, said Gerry E. Hendershot of the National Center for Health Statistics, who prepared the report.    &quot;One factor that certainly is involved is the selectivity of immigration to this country,&quot; Dr. Hendershot said in a telephone interview this week.    &quot;People with higher educations and professional skills have a better opportunity to migrate to this country, so people coming here tend to be from groups that have good health,&quot; he said.    And, he said, &quot;immigrants tend to be younger, on average, than the general population, and younger people in general tend to be healthier than older people.&quot;    Dr. Hendershot noted that the Immigration and Naturalization Service does some health screening for applicants for U.S. residency.    Finally, he pointed out the study was based on interviews with 58,682 households. By looking at household groups, the analysis would not include transients, such as migrant workers, who may tend to be in poorer health.    The difference between native-born and foreign-born Americans in being confined to bed for four days or more covered all age groups up to 65. Over age 65, however, the groups were similar to one another 26.3% for natives and 27.6% of foreignborns.    By sex, 18.5% of native-born males were sick in bed four days, compared with 15.3% of foreign-born men. For women, the figures were 26.8% for natives and 22% for those from overseas.    During the year before the interview, 18.5% of native-born Americans and 16.2% of foreign-born people had been in contact with a physician or other health-care provider six times or more.    Of the approximately 156.6 million Americans aged 18 and over at the time of the survey, about 14.9 million were listed as foreign-born. </TEXT></DOC>
