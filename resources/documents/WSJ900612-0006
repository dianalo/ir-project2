The case has been closely watched by pension experts andfinancial planners.</LP><TEXT>   The suit had charged that the ESOP's acquisition ofParsons's shares was a breach of fiduciary responsibility,misuse of corporate assets and a termination of predecessorplans, all of which injured the participants in thetransaction.   Specifically, the employees had charged that the companyexecutives who designed and implemented the buy-out pocketedmillions of dollars, while the employees' future retirementfunds became saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars ofdebt.   But, according to Parsons, U.S. Distrct Judge RobertKelleher found after a five-day trial that the ESOPretirement committee had acted &quot;both independently andprudently in deciding that the buy-out was in the bestinterests of the ESOP participants.&quot;   An attorney for the plaintiffs said they would appeal. &quot;Irespectfully believe the decision will be reversed,&quot; saidFrederick Furth, senior partner of Furth, Fahrner andamp; Mason inSan Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
