But when a president changes his mind, the ramifications can befar-reaching and sometimes costly.   For instance, Bush planned to spend last weekend at his vacationhome in Kennebunkport, Maine.   He was to make a four-day event of it, with education speechesin Union, N.J., on the way up and in Rochester, N.Y., on the wayback.   Bush delivered the speech in New Jersey on Thursday, butscrubbed the long vacation weekend in Maine so he could be on handfor Friday's unveiling of a budget compromise with congressionalleaders.   Then he added a new destination for Monday, scrapping upstateNew York for Hamtramck, Mich., where he announced a package ofeconomic incentives for Poland.   White House aides wanted a locale with a large Polish-Americanpopulation, and Rochester didn't quite fit the bill.   Canceling the Kennebunkport trip meant dozens of reserved hotelrooms _ obtained by White House aides, security agents andreporters _ had to be ditched at the last minute, and a fleet offive dozen rental cars returned.   It also meant elaborate advance and security preparations inRochester, where Bush was to visit an Eastman Kodak plant and speakat a school, went for naught.   ``The White House goes where the president goes,'' saidpresidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Last month, a planned trip to California and other Westernstates was scheduled, then postponed and finally canceled. Now, theWest Coast trip is on again _ but in modified form, for later thismonth.   In the meantime, another Kennebunkport trip scheduled for May5-6 was scrapped. And, a presidential visit to Lockerbie, Scotland,site of last December's Pan Am Flight 103 disaster, was penciledonto the president's itinerary for his four-nation European trip inMay, then suddenly taken off.   Bush flip-flops, of course, include more than trips.   On semiautomatic assault rifles, Bush initially said he opposedany attempts to control or restrict them. But he later moved tosuspend imports of these weapons.   Then, he tightened that ban, angering congressional gun-controlopponents in the process, amid hints that the administration wouldcome out with permanent new restrictions on both domestic andforeign-produced assault weapons.   He admitted to ``a pulse change'' on the subject of gun control.   Bush also did an about-face on federal involvement in cleanupoperations in the Alaska oil spill, first praising Exxon for thejob it was doing and voicing opposition to a federal takeover; thenmoving a week later to put one in effect.   Bush also executed a turnabout on U.S. funds for the NicaraguanContras. First he echoed the Reagan administration positionfavoring continuing military support for the anti-governmentrebels. But he wound up going along with a bipartisan agreementsharply scaling back U.S. support for the Contras.   He also has seemed to come down on both sides of the issue oftuition tax credits.   When a student at a White House session on March 29 asked him ifthe parents of a child in private school should get a federal taxcredit for the tuition they pay, he said, ``No, they shouldn't.''   But he told a group of conservatives and evangelical Christiansthis week that he supports the idea of tuition tax credits,although budget constraints prevent him from proposing one at thistime.   Bush's flips and shifts prompted Washington Post politicalcartoonist Herblock to depict him as a gaunt figure atop aweathervane, flopping one way then the other, a finger jutting upto catch the shifting winds of public opinion.   But Bush, after all, is the president. And there's noprohibition against changing his mind, either on trips or on issues.   And kinder and gentler only goes so far. ``If you're too politein life, you get stomped on,'' Bush told a youngster who washesitant in raising her hand at a question-and-answer session atthe White House.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
