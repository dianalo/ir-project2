A National Labor Relations Board, which has been hostile to workers' interests over the past eight years, has translated into a disproportionate advantage for management at the collective-bargaining table. Constitutional and legislative guarantees to freedom of association, including the right to organize and belong to a union, exist; however, if the neutral arbiter, namely government, fails to enforce these democratic rights and places its hand squarely on the manager's side of the scale, then real wages will decline for unionized and non-unionized alike.    Call it what you may, but the corrosion of democratic rights has resulted in fattened short-term profits and modest wage increases: a trick all too familiar in Poland and to numerous dictators. Regrettably capitalism has failed to support democracy in the U.S.    Management excesses have caught the eye of the international community. In May, the International Labor Organization fired a warning shot across the bow of the Reagan administration, cautioning against making legal the permanent replacement of locked-out workers on the grounds that this recent management tactic is contrary to internationally acceptable labor standards.    Many workers have become fearful of management and surely less loyal. Workers are not fooled by wage hikes that fail to keep pace with inflation; instead, management buys passive aggression when it cuts wages in real terms. And when basic democratic rights are assaulted by an employer, a worker finds it awfully hard to comprehend how their well-being is necessarily tied to that of their current employer. A corporation's enemies can start to look a lot like allies to workers who have been stripped of their rights and dignity.
