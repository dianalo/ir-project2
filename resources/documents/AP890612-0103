RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today limited the deadlinesfor filing some lawsuits that accuse employers of illegal sex bias.   In a 5-3 ruling, the court threw out a suit by three women whosaid a change in the seniority system at an ATandamp;T plant in Illinoisdiscriminated against them.   The court said the women waited too long to sue.   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said the women had300 days to sue from the time the seniority system change wasadopted _ not 300 days from the time they were affected personallyby the new seniority rules.   Scalia said the shorter time period for suing applies to cases inwhich an employer is accused of unintentional bias _ adopting rulesthat on their face do not discriminate on the basis of sex.   ``Allowing a facially neutral system to be challenged ... manyyears after its adoption would disrupt'' the legitimate interests ofother workers who benefitted by the new rules, Scalia said.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall said theruling shields acts of intentional discrimination.   He said employees who are victims of bias must sue within 300days of a change in the employer's system ``even if the employee ...could not reasonably have expected to be demoted or otherwiseconcretely harmed by the new system at the time of its adoption and,indeed, even if the employee was not working in the affecteddivision of the company at the time of the system's adoption.''   Such a severe interpretation of deadlines for suing violatesTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawing discriminationbased on race or sex, he said.   Justices Willima J. Brennan and Harry A. Blackmun joinedMarshall's dissent.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not take part in the ruling.   The case involves Patricia A. Lorance, Janice M. King and CarolS. Bueschen, employees in ATandamp;T's Montgomery Works in Aurora, Ill.   They were demoted in 1982 because of a restructured senioritysystem.   Under the change, seniority for the skilled job of tester nolonger was determined on the basis of how long a worker was at theplant but rather how long the employee worked as a tester.   The change was incorporated into a contract between ATandamp;TTechnologies and Local 1942 of the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers.   The three women said the change was designed to limit the jobrights of female workers who had been promoted recently intotraditionally male jobs.   They filed charges with the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission in April 1983 _ within the 300-day time limit prescribedby law if that period started with the date the revamped seniorityrules caused their demotions.   But a federal magistrate in 1986 ruled the three waited too longbecause they had not filed their complaint within 300 days of whenthe new system was adopted in 1979.   The magistrate's ruling was upheld by a federal trial judge, the7th U.S. Cirucit Court of Appeals and today by the Supreme Court.   The case is Lorance vs. ATandamp;T, 87-1428.</TEXT></DOC>
