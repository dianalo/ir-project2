McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Eugene Qahhaar started Dock's takeout 15years ago, he was just another black businessman peddling hot dogsand hamburgers from a rundown storefront on the South Side.   But since 1984, Qahhaar has taken on new partners, Dock's hasexpanded to 17 outlets in this city and five more in Philadelphia,and he has set his sights on becoming a major force in the fast-foodindustry.   What sets Dock's apart in the fast-food free-for-all is the fishthat anchors the menu _ dipped in a spiced batter concocted byQahhaar. It's not spicy-hot _ he calls the flavor ``continental.''   Qahhaar and partners _ Dennis Robertson, president of FishyThings Inc., Dock's parent company, and Qahhaar's former landlord,Joe Pecora _ hope to find a niche for Dock's in middle-class blackcommunities around the country before taking on a broader market.   ``In the beginning, I did not set out to create an ethnicbusiness,'' said Qahhaar, whose partners are white. ``I wantedsomething to apply across the board.''   But Dock's started out in a black neighborhood and business wasbooming, so they concentrated on that market, though the firstdowntown, sit-down Dock's is to open in Chicago later this year.   Four years ago, there were four Dock's. Last year, a surge ofgrowth brought 11 more to the Chicago area and put the fledglingchain in Philly.   Franchises, offered for the first time this year, make up threeof the 17 area outlets operating now, Robertson said.   Within four years, the partners want 28 company-owned restaurantsand 40 franchise operations in such cities as Detroit, Cleveland andSt. Louis.   Dock's takeout menu offers batter-fried fish sandwiches, fish andchips, catfish and smelt _ as well as fried shrimp, seafood salad,chowder, gumbo, cole slaw and onion rings. For dessert, sweet potatopie, bean pie embellish the more routine offerings of cheesecake andcarrot cake.   The fish sandwich, whiting fried in polyunsaturated oil, ``isjust sensational,'' Robertson said.   Dock's orange-white-and-green shops have a 1950s flavor, withportholes and roped timbers, a spouting-whale logo and the slogan,``That great fish.''   ``We don't go into standard buildings, so the colors are reallywhat alert the people,'' Robertson said, noting Dock's prefers torehabilitate abandoned inner-city stores and gasoline stations.   Dock's owners have their work cut out for them, partly becauseseafood can be a tricky menu item in the competitive fast-foodbusiness. Most people still prefer burgers.   ``Fish chains have had a bad time. Arthur Treacher's is anexample, although they are making somewhat of a comeback,'' saidStuart Meyer, professor of policy and environment at NorthwesternUniversity's J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management.   But a distinctive product can make the difference.   ``Offering something that is successful in one place makes iteasier to penetrate other markets, if it's really new,'' Meyer said.   Dock's can make it with proper financial backing and a solidmanagement formula, Meyer said. If Dock's achieves success in theinner city, the market will look more attractive to others.   Qahhaar says he's sure he has a winner.   Docks is expected to top $11 million in sales this year in thecity, up from $10 million in 1988, he said.   The Philadelphia outlets, which did $1.9 million in sales lastyear, are being franchised, Robertson said.   While the partners have been approached about selling stock tothe public to raise money for more expansion, Robertson said, ``weneed to do some growing and proving this kind of success can bereplicated elsewhere.''   Qahhaar, in his 40s, opened his first restaurant in 1973, sellinghot dogs and hamburgers. He named the place after his father, DockMeadows, an Alabama house painter. Qahhaar _ formerly Eugene Meadows_ changed his own name when he converted to Islam.   One night, a Muslim selling fish door to door offered him a gooddeal if he'd buy 50 pounds of whiting. Business was poor, so he gaveit a try.   ``I bought some spices and made up a recipe,'' said Qahhaar. ``Imade several batches of batter and the one I liked was the one Ikept.''   The fish was gone in a week, but the customers who bought it keptcoming back.   By 1975, Dock's was specializing in seafood, but Qahhaar washaving trouble making ends meet. Five years ago, despite a thrivingbusiness, he was months behind in rent.   His then-landlord, Pecora, introduced him to Robertson, then partowner of several Sizzler restaurant franchises in area suburbs.   Robertson remembers he didn't look forward to the meeting. He wasdoing fine and had no desire to get involved in an inner-citybusiness.   ``There was a great line of people outside waiting to getserved,'' he recalled. ``I said, `What does he need us for?' That'swhen Joe revealed to me that he owed him a lot of money.''   A cordial relationship developed, and the partnership in whicheach controls a third of Fishy Things Inc. Robertson shed his otherbusiness interests.   Robertson concedes the inner-city locations could hold downprofits because of generally lower household incomes, but notesthere are advantages, including high population density and fewercompetitors.   Property is cheaper, and there are plenty of rehab opportunities.   Qahhaar says he's taken some heat for taking on partners, but hasfew regrets.   ``I look upon myself as a creative person. Administration is notmy strong suit. I struggled along for several years, not getting thecompany to the point where I wanted to,'' he said.   ``If you have to do things to make it stronger, to get more moneyor better management skills, then you do it,'' Qahhaar said.   Pecora handles real estate decisions and Robertson the businessend at Fishy Things headquarters in southwest suburban Willowbrook.   ``When Robertson came aboard as a partner, he had a portfolio thebanks could respect,'' Qahaar recalled. ``We received bankersupport, paid debts. A lot of problems were eliminated.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 18</NOTE></DOC>
