The charges, filed in October 1986, arose from an alleged scheme to switch profitable customer trades from legitimate accounts into accounts controlled by the salesmen, their friends or their relatives.    In federal court in Manhattan, Gary Nerlinger and Robert Varipapa were convicted of one conspiracy charge each. Mr. Nerlinger was found guilty of seven mail fraud charges and Mr. Varipapa of nine such charges.    Mr. Nerlinger faces a prison sentence of up to 40 years and as much as $17,000 in fines. Mr. Varipapa faces up to 50 years in prison and a maximum fine of $19,000. Sentencing is set for Feb. 11.    Mark Pomerantz, a lawyer for Mr. Nerlinger, said he intended to file an appeal. Mr. Varipapa's lawyer, Salvatore Quagliata, couldn't be reached.    According to Rudolph W. Giuliani, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, the two men, acting in concert with First Commodity's main trader in New York, Anthony DeAngelis, had accounts opened in the names of friends and relatives so profitable trades could be diverted. These accounts made aggregate profits of about $340,000 on total initial investments of about $135,000, Mr. Giuliani said.    Mr. DeAngelis and other co-conspirators named in the indictment had been charged separately and all entered guilty pleas, Mr. Giuliani said. </TEXT></DOC>
