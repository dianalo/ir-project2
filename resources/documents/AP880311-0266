WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DICKSON, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Igor Perlovsky is a big man in Dickson.He runs the only bar in town. He owns the only VCR.   And for the 5,000 Soviets who inhabit the world's northernmostcity on the ice-bound Kara Sea, drinks and movies at Perlovsky's``Coupole'' lounge are a cherished escape from the 10 months ofwinter when temperatures plunge to 75 degrees below zero and thewind freezes the moisture in the corners of people's eyes.   Outdoor sports are out of the question on the desolate icedesert that stretches more than 300 miles from here to the south.Even for those hardy enough to play outdoors, it's hard to see asoccer ball during the three-month polar night. Nor is thereswimming during the two-month ``summer,'' when the mercury climbsto an average high of 40.   There used to be an automobile in Dickson, which is reachableonly by air and sea, but the novelty of driving on the city's threeor four roads wore off, and the 11-year-old Moskvich subcompact hasbeen garaged with only 70 kilometers (44 miles) on the odometer.   Every few weeks, a resident sights a polar bear lumbering alongthe moguled ice paths that pass for streets, and telling tales ofnarrow escapes from the Arctic's natural inhabitants is a popularpasttime.   Police sometimes are summoned to chase the bears away by firingrifles into the air, but they are forbidden to shoot the beastsexcept in life-threatening situations: polar bears are protected bythe Soviet Red Book, the endangered species list.   At first glance, Dickson appears uninhabited. The plume from asingle smokestack atop the city's steam-generating plant providesthe first sign of life. On closer inspection, a few fur-hattedpedestrians can be seen bobbing between the snowbanks. The silenceis broken by the roar of a jeep or the thrashing of a tracked``vezdekhod'' _ the refitted armored personnel carriers that serveas Dickson's police cars, ambulances and buses.   The city, which lies 500 miles inside the Arctic Circle and1,100 miles below the North Pole, is named for Oskar Dickson, aSwedish brewer and financier who bankrolled the internationalexpedition that discovered the port in 1875. Dickson's retention ofhis name through a century of political tumult in Russia isevidence of its isolation from Moscow and the official penchant forrenaming places for Soviet heroes.   The first settlers arrived in Dickson in 1915 to operate a radiotransmitter at the port. By World War II, a few hundred were livinghere to handle shipping on the Yenisei River that flows into theKara just to the south.   Today, Dickson's port is the gateway to the Northern Sea Routethat provides Europe's only direct sealink to the Pacific Ocean.   Gennady M. Svetkov, deputy chief of the city's governingcouncil, said the port, which is the only major enterprise inDickson, generates revenues of 6 million rubles ($10 million) ayear. That figure could skyrocket if the Soviet Union reopens theNorthern Sea Route as Communist Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachevproposed last October. It has been closed to all but Soviet vesselssince 1964.   In winter, supply ships, shepherded by icebreakers, make theirway into the frozen port every month or so. But in July and Augustthe waterfront bustles as Soviet cargo ships ply the Arctic Oceanwith goods bound for Japan, China and points south.   Increased ship traffic and the arrival of foreign crews couldchange this Arctic outpost, but Dickson's city fathers regard aninternational port as a distant prospect.   ``Such decisions are in the hands of the mainlanders,'' saidSvetkov, referring to those who live beyond the tundra.   For now, Dickson's residents appear content to bear with thehardships to keep the sea lanes open and gather data from eightweather research stations drifting in the Arctic Ocean.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
