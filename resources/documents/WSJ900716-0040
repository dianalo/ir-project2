Bailout bonds are the debt securities sold by theResolution Funding Corp., a federal agency created byCongress to help finance the government's rescue of savingsinstitutions.</LP><TEXT>   So far Refcorp has issued $18 billion of the bonds,including $5 billion of 30-year bonds sold Tuesday. Thelatest auction went smoothly, in contrast to two previousdisastrous auctions of 40-year Refcorp bonds. In the earliermishaps, the government sold most of the bonds to Wall Streetdealers, which got stung when they couldn't drum up enoughdemand from investors.   But now investors are warming to the Refcorp bonds. Demandfor the securities has picked up considerably since lastweek's auction.   &quot;The yield pickup is very attractive,&quot; said Allen DavidEllison, an analyst and portfolio manager at FidelityManagement andamp; Research in Boston. He said that with Refcorpoffering essentially the same ironclad government guaranteeas a plain vanilla Treasury bond, some investors arewondering: Why invest in a Treasury at 8.5% when Refcorpyields are 8.9%?   Even some money managers who were down on the bonds a fewmonths ago like Refcorp a little better now.   Take Ian McKinnon, head of fixed-income investments atVanguard Group, the mutual fund company. After Refcorp's40-year bond auction in April, he riled Treasury officials bytelling USA Today that the Refcorp bond sales were producing&quot;dogs&quot; for the market and saying: &quot;Maybe the government istrying to start a kennel.&quot;   Well, Mr. McKinnon isn't so harsh these days. Although hedidn't buy Refcorp bonds at last week's auction, &quot;we willtake a good look at them in the secondary market and at thenext auction,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess this proves that every doghas its day.&quot;   The new fondness for Refcorp stems from several factors:the higher relative yields on the securities, analysts'reports saying Refcorp bonds are nearly indistinguishable incredit quality from Treasury securities, and a generalperception that interest rates eventually will fall, whichwould boost the value of all fixed-income investments.   And as investor acceptance grows, analysts expect thespread, or gap, between Treasury securities and Refcorps willnarrow, which in effect will make Refcorp bonds morevaluable. At last week's auction, the 30-year Refcorps wereissued with an average yield of 8.93%, or 0.39 percentagepoint higher than yields on Treasury securities.   Although marginal yield differences don't always excitesmall investors, in the intensely competitive institutionalworld of mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds,even a quarter of a percentage point is considered atremendous difference.   But there's more allure to Refcorp than just a higheryield. Last week, traders said, Metropolitan Life InsuranceCo. purchased a large amount of Refcorp bonds -- possibly asmuch as $1 billion -- while selling corporate andmortgage-backed bonds. On the surface, this might seem likean odd trade, considering mortgages and corporate bonds havehigher yields than government bonds.   Although MetLife doesn't like to talk about its investmentdecisions, other money managers say that big institutionalinvestors -- especially insurance companies -- are playingwhat they call &quot;a relative performance game&quot; with the Refcorpbonds. Currently, prices of high-grade utility and telephonecompany bonds and certain mortgage-backed bonds have becomewhat the market considers &quot;expensive&quot; relative to Treasurybonds, meaning only that yields on these securities havenarrowed relative to yields on Treasury bonds. Meanwhile,Refcorp was sold at a relatively wide spread to Treasurys.   But, says Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager atDreyfus Corp., &quot;if you buy the economic downturn theory,Refcorp spreads will narrow because they aregovernment-backed bonds, while corporate spreads will widen.&quot;Ms. Kenworthy essentially is suggesting that corporate bondswill become cheaper and Refcorp bonds will rise in value.   If that happens, &quot;what you give up in yield you more thanmake up for in relative performance,&quot; she said.   &quot;We view this as a win-win situation,&quot; said Mike Martino,executive vice president and portfolio manager at Back BayAdvisors, a subsidiary of the New England Life Insurance Co.&quot;You can win with rates coming down, and you can win withyields on Refcorp coming closer to yields on Treasurys.&quot;   Mr. Martino said that many investors shied away fromRefcorp bonds in the beginning because they didn't fullyunderstand what they were. &quot;No one likes to invest in theunknown,&quot; he said.   Part of the unknown had to do with the future size ofRefcorp offerings. Congress limited Refcorp's borrowingability to $30 billion. Yet as estimates of the Sandamp;L bailout'scost grew from $100 billion to $500 billion, some investorsfeared the government would raise the limit and swamp themarket with Refcorp bonds, which would overwhelm demand andput pressure on prices. Now, however, it appears that moreand more Treasury borrowings will be used to finance thethrift rescue, which will add to the size of the budgetdeficit but not the size of future Refcorp offerings.   Once the full $30 billion have been issued, the size ofRefcorp bonds on the market will be large enough to make it afairly liquid market, but small enough for the bonds tomaintain a certain &quot;scarcity&quot; value.   Refcorp bonds were also boosted by analysts' reports. J.P.Morgan andamp; Co., which is trying to convince reluctant investorsthat Refcorp bonds are suitable alternatives to Treasurys,said in a recent report that Refcorp bonds are &quot;essentiallyindistinguishable from U.S. Treasurys.&quot;   Corporations and municipalities also are being targeted byinvestment firms as potential Refcorp buyers and have beentold that Refcorp bonds could be used as part of a complexplan to &quot;defease&quot; existing debt. Recently, the accountingfirm of Deloitte andamp; Touche said the credit quality of Refcorpbonds is high enough to use for defeasing purposes.   Defeasance is a technique whereby a bond issuer maydischarge old, low-rate debt by purchasing a smaller amountof higher-yielding U.S. Treasury debt. The Treasurys are putin a trust to service the old debt being retired.   Though the Refcorp bonds aren't direct obligations of theTreasury, the Treasury guarantees interest payments. And theprincipal is secured by zero-coupon Treasurys, purchased byRefcorp from the Treasury.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices rose as the Federal Reserve sent what tradersinterpreted as a clear signal of a credit-easing move.   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan prepared investors for theaction by saying Thursday that the Fed was poised to easecredit because of mounting evidence of a credit crunch. Hedidn't say when the move would come, but the answer cameFriday, shortly before noon EDT, when the Fed took action inthe money markets to inject funds into the banking system.   &quot;It's clear now that the Fed has eased,&quot; said Donald J.Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. HenryEngler, economist at Chemical Bank, agreed: &quot;I think it'sabout as clear as it gets.&quot;   The Fed's maneuver led to a further widening of the gapbetween short-term and long-term interest rates, known inbond market jargon as a widening of the yield curve. Severalinvestment managers fear the Fed pulled its trigger too soon,and thus that the bond market's rally may be nearing an end.   Easing credit now could lead to higher inflation laterthis year and possibly also drive down the American dollar inthe foreign-exchange markets, investment strategists say.Some also argue that the Fed should have waited untilCongress and the White House reach a definitive agreement onslashing the government's huge budget deficits. Now, theysay, Washington lawmakers face less pressure to take boldaction on the deficit.   The Fed's move &quot;probably won't have much of a stimulativeeffect on the economy because it's so small, but it also doeslittle to improve the inflation outlook,&quot; says BobDiClemente, senior economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;Ifyou're looking to the Fed as a bulwark against inflation,then this doesn't support that case.&quot;   Thus, Mr. DiClemente adds, &quot;if you've missed the bondrally, now is not the time to get in, because we're notlikely to get a big rally from here.&quot;   Despite the Fed's move to lower rates, banks once againshowed they are in no rush to cut their own rates. The prime,or base, rates at major banks remained unchanged at 10%.Banks use the prime as a peg to set rates on loans to manysmall and medium-sized companies, as well as on loans to manyindividual investors.   Banks long have demonstrated an uneven way of reacting toFed policy changes. When the Fed tightens credit, bankstypically react quickly by raising their prime rate. But whenthe Fed cuts rates, banks discover reasons to delay loweringtheir rates.   In the long-term bond market, Treasury bond prices roseFriday by about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 faceamount. For example, the government's 30-year bonds werequoted late in the day at 103 7/32, up from 102 21/32Thursday evening. The yield fell slightly to 8.45% from8.49%.   Yields fell more on shorter-term Treasury issues. Forexample, the yield on the government's two-year notes fell to8.12% from 8.21%. Thus, the gap between the two-year and30-year issues widened to 0.33 percentage point from 0.28percentage point Thursday and only 0.14 percentage point inlate June.   Rates also fell on short-term Treasury bills. The latestthree-month Treasury bill was quoted late Friday at adiscount rate of 7.58%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.83%.That compared with a rate of 7.68% to yield 7.92% Thursday.The rate on six-month bills wound up at 7.49% to yield 7.89%,down from 7.57% to yield 7.96% Thursday.   The Fed's move Friday came as the interest rate on federalfunds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, wastrading at 8.25%. Now, traders say, the funds rate is likelyto hover close to 8%, down from 8.25% previously.   Mr. Fine of Chase Manhattan described the Fed action as &quot;avery modest&quot; move and predicted it won't be the last thisyear. &quot;I think further ease will come but not for awhile, notuntil they {Fed officials} see definitive evidence of asustainable moderation in inflation,&quot; he said.   In other markets:   -- Corporate bond prices rose. Investment-grade bonds roseabout 1/4 to 3/8 point. In the high-yield market, junk bondprices rose, too.   -- Junk bonds issued by department and chain stores postedstrong gains, following reports showing stronger retailsales.   -- Municipal bond prices also rose. The New JerseyTurnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 climbed about 1/2point to 99 1/2 to yield 7.23%.   ---   Tom Herman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
