The National Committee of the Social Democratic Party, or SDP, voted yesterday against recommending a full merger with the Liberal Party. The vote rebuffed the Liberals, who have sought a merger of the two parties since the Alliance's poor showing in the parliamentary election. During the campaign, the Alliance pressed to establish itself as Britain's main opposition party.    Instead of a merger, the SDP leadership voted 18-13 to recommend that its members approve a &quot;closer constitutional framework&quot; for the Alliance that &quot;preserves the identity of the SDP.&quot; The motion, and a separate one calling for a merger, will appear on a mail ballot submitted to the SDP's 60,000 members between next Wednesday and Aug. 5.    The SDP-Liberal Alliance, formed in 1981, is an informal agreement under which the two parties have voted together in the House of Commons, chosen joint spokesmen on parliamentary issues and jointly put forward candidates for parliamentary seats. The two parties have retained separate leaders and annual party conventions.    But since the election, the parties have bickered bitterly in public. David Steel, the Liberal leader, has insisted that a fully merged party would appeal to more voters. David Owen, the SDP leader, has threatened to resign as the party's head if a merger goes through.    Some political analysts here doubt the Alliance can survive these intramural squabbles. &quot;We are certainly now seeing the death of the Alliance,&quot; said John Curtice, a political-science lecturer at the University of Liverpool.    After yesterday's vote, Liberal Party President Des Wilson said he was &quot;sorry&quot; SDP leaders had voted against a merger. &quot;We will now have to decide when and how to ballot our own members.&quot; He said the Liberal Party may offer members a third choice -- &quot;that if the SDP does not want a full merger, the two parties should amicably separate.&quot;    The SDP membership vote seems likely to be close. The party itself is split over a merger, as the narrow National Committee vote indicates. Although Dr. Owen opposes a merger, the three other SDP founders -- all of whom lost their parliamentary races this month -- support it. SDP President Shirley Williams, one of those three, vowed yesterday to campaign for a merger among SDP members.    Support for a merger may be higher among local SDP members than its leadership, Mr. Curtice said. By campaigning together in local and national elections, he added, SDPs and Liberals &quot;have realized they have a degree in common.&quot; What's more, the two parties are more accustomed to cooperating on the local than the national level. The Alliance controls 120 local-government councils, nearly one-third of Britain's total.    In the June 11 election, the ruling Conservative Party won 376 parliamentary seats, the opposition Labor Party won 240 seats and the Alliance won 22 seats. Of the 22 Alliance seats, the SDP holds five. </TEXT></DOC>
