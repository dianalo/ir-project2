But the fledgling electronics concern dumped the small Detroit securities firm that took it public just one year ago.    &quot;We're stung, but welcome to the world of investment banking,&quot; said John C. Donnelly, senior vice president of First of Michigan Capital Corp. His firm wasn't asked to help underwrite the new offering, which instead will be exclusively handled by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Capital Markets unit.    Code-Alarm plans to offer one million new common shares, which will boost by nearly 50% its current 2.1 million shares outstanding. (All but about 630,000 shares are held by company insiders.) Thus the company's earnings per share will be greatly diluted, at least for the short term, which explains the stock's sharp decline yesterday. It closed in national over-the-counter trading at $11.375, down $1.875.    Still, the stock remains well above the company's price of $7.125 a share at the end of August, just before Code-Alarm landed two big contracts to supply dealers of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. The contracts -- which total $13.3 million, slightly more than Code-Alarm's sales for all of 1987 -- are for Code-Alarm's automobile security and keyless entry systems.    The systems work like this: Using a radio transmitter that attaches to a key chain, automobile owners can lock their cars' doors, disable the ignition system and, with some models, turn on an alarm system by pushing a button on the remote-control device. When the button is pushed again, it reverses all that. A second button opens the trunk remotely.    Code-Alarm also is developing a line of home-security systems, which it says will get some of the proceeds from the new stock offering. The money also will be used to expand sales and marketing activities, buy manufacturing equipment and possibly to make acquisitions. The company said it expects the new shares to sell for about $13 each, and yield it between $11.7 million and $13.6 million (if optional extra shares are sold), after Merrill Lynch's underwriting fee.    First of Michigan is clearly disappointed it won't share in that fee, especially because it helped Code-Alarm when the company wasn't a hot stock. The securities concern took Code-Alarm public on Oct. 9, 1987, and gave the company the underwriting proceeds at a lunch on Oct. 19 -- the day the stock market crashed.    &quot;We supported the company and did the first underwriting, but we weren't invited to join in this one,&quot; Mr. Donnelly says. He adds diplomatically, however, that &quot;we are very supportive&quot; of Code-Alarm's planned new offering.    Code-Alarm officials are sheepish about appearing to abandon a hometown friend for big-city bankers. &quot;I don't know what I can say,&quot; says Kenneth M. Mueller, director of public relations. &quot;Merrill Lynch has a national scope and structure, and we think we are ready for that. I wish life were serene and tranquil, but it isn't.&quot;    Mr. Mueller got a mild jolt yesterday. He was poised to release Code-Alarm's third-quarter earnings, but then abruptly delayed the announcement because the company filed its registration statement for the planned new offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the first half of 1988, Code-Alarm's net income jumped 62% to $743,000, or 35 cents a share, on sales of $9.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
