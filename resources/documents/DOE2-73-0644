This makes solarenergy a promising energy source, capable of meeting a significant proportionof Taiwan's rapidly increasing energy demand. To speed up the progressof the nation's energy availability, the Energy and Mining Research/ServiceOrganization (EMRO) of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)has begun its leading role in solar energy research and development since1982. Although EMRO is relatively young, it has pioneered in many areasof solar energy utilization in Taiwan. The list includes solar hot watersystems, solar desiccant cooling, and solar industrial process heat.This paper will present the research works in the last two years (1985-1987)as well as the future works in solar energy at EMRO of ITRI.</TEXT></DOC>
