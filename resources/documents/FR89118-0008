Controlof Emissions of Organic Compounds From Stationary Sources, Rule 3745-21-09;V. Compliance Test Methods and Procedures, Rule 3745-21-01; VI. Discussionof Public Comment; VII. Final Action.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background Information</ITAG>On March 28, 1983, the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA)submitted amendments to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-21and supporting data, to USEPA as a proposed revision to the ozone portionof its SIP. OEPA adopted these amended rules in final form in two separaterulemaking actions on June 21, 1982, and January 24, 1983. OAC Chapter3745-21, entitled ``Carbon Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials,Hydrocarbons, and Related Material Standards'', contains Ohio's VOC RACTI and II regulations. The regulations are embodied in the OAC as follows:Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01; Attainment dates and compliance time schedules,Rule 3745-21-04; Control of emissions of organic compounds from stationarysources, Rule 3745-21-09; and Compliance test methods and procedures, Rule3745-21-10. USEPA initially approved these regulations as part of Ohio'sSIP for ozone in separate rulemaking actions on October 31, 1980, and June29, 1982 (45 FR 72122 and 47 FR 28097).The following discussion presents a summary of the proposed changes tothe existing rules. Where appropriate, the discussion presents the resultsof USEPA's analysis and USEPA's conclusion as to whether or not the changeis approvable. USEPA's complete analysis is contained in a document entitled``Technical Support Document for Ohio RACT I and II Rule Revisions'', datedJuly 18, 1983. This document is available for review at the Region V officelisted above. For further details, the reader is referred to this documentand the State submittal of March 28, 1983, which includes the adopted versionof Rules 3742-21-01, 04, 09, 10, and supporting documentation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01</ITAG>In today's rulemaking action, USEPA is approving all new terms and definitionswhich Ohio has added and revised pertaining to the source categories ofpaper and vinyl coating, and to the use of cutback and emulsified asphaltsin road construction and maintenance. The following portions of Rule 3745-21-01have been revised.a. Section (D)(16), (36), (50)The definition of paper coating has been revised to include coatings appliedby an extrusion coater and a definition of an extrusion coater has beenadded. The definition of vinyl coating has been revised to include applicationof coating by means of a knife or roll coater.b. Section (F)(1-8)Ohio has clarified the existing definitions and added new terms relatedto amendments to Rule 3745-21-09(N) on the use of asphalts in road constructionand maintenance.c. Sections (E)(8) and (J)(5)Typographical errors in Sections (E)(8) and (J)(5) have been corrected.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Attainment Dates and Compliance Time Schedules, Rule 3745-21-04</ITAG>a. Sections (C)(2) and (C)(35), Extended Compliance ScheduleUSEPA is taking no action on the compliance date extension contained inRule 3745-21-04, Sections (C)(2) and (C)(35), granted by Ohio to the Hondaof America Manufacturing, Inc. auto assembly plant in Marysville. An extensionfor the same period of time was granted through a permit issued under Ohio'sfederally approved new source review program, it is currently federallyenforceable, and any further federal action here is unnecessary.USEPA is approving the State's revisions to the compliance time schedulescontained in Rule 3745-21-04, as described in III b, c, d, and e below.b. Section (C)(3) Can Coating LinesSection (C)(3) has been revised to include an alternative compliance schedulefor can coating lines subject to applicable control requirements. The alternativeschedule may allow extension of the compliance deadline to December 31,1985, if the owner or operator of the line demonstrates the necessity ofthe compliance date extension to the satisfaction of the Director of OEPAby supplying the documentation required in subparts (i) through (iv). Acan coating compliance date extension, through the end of 1985, is consistentwith USEPA's policy on compliance date extensions regarding the ultimateattainment date of December 31, 1987.However, there is no replicable procedure specified for the Director todetermine if the extension granted under this procedure will ensure reasonablefurther progress toward attainment. Therefore, USEPA will consider approvalof compliance date extensions if each request is submitted to the Agencyas an individual SIP revision. USEPA approves this section on the understandingthat the State will submit each extension request to USEPA for approvalthrough the SIP process.c. Section (C)(15) Cutback and Emulsified AsphaltsA compliance date of April 15, 1982, has been added to OAC Rule 3745-21-04for the use of emulsified asphalt in road construction and maintenance.This is not a compliance date extension as it refers to a new requirement.d. <T3>Section (C)(29) Gasoline Tank Trucks  </T3>Ohio has revised the compliance date by which gasoline tank trucks arerequired to comply with leak testing, record-keeping, and reporting requirements.This revision requires compliance by March 31, 1983.  This extension is consistent with USEPA's August 7, 1986, compliance dateextension policy regarding the ultimate attainment date of December 31,1987. This extension can be considered expeditious because it is less than3 years from the time the rule was adopted (February 12, 1981).  However, there is no replicable procedure specified for the Director todetermine if the extension granted under this procedure will ensure reasonablefurther progress toward attainment. Therefore, USEPA will consider approvalof compliance date extensions if each request is submitted to the Agencyas an individual SIP revision. USEPA approves this section on the understandingthat the State will submit each extension request to USEPA for approvalthrough the SIP process.  e. <T3>Section (C)(33) External Floating Roof Tanks  </T3>The compliance time schedules for awarding contracts, initiating construction,and completing construction to retrofit tanks to comply with the SIP, havebeen revised to March 1, October 1, and November 1, 1982, respectively.The deadlines for submitting a control plan to OEPA and for final compliancewith Rule 3745-21-09(Z) are unchanged.  These schedules can be considered expeditious according to USEPA's August7, 1986, policy and compliance date extension, because they are within3 years of adoption of the rule (February 12, 1981). These revisions donot interfere with RFP because (1) they do not change the date by whichfinal compliance with the external floating roof tank rule is to be achieved,and (2) they do not interfere with the final attainment date of December31, 1987. Therefore, this compliance date extension is considered to bereasonable.  <ITAG tagnum="84"><T4>IV. Control of Emission of Organic Compounds From Stationary Sources,Rule 3745-21-09  </T4></ITAG>In general, USEPA finds this rule to be acceptable, based on USEPA's policiesand Control Technique Guidelines (CTG), and is approving the followingamendments. A discussion of actions other than approvals are containedin Part IV.b of this notice.  <T3>a. </T3><T3>Final Approval  </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">Sections:  </ITAG>andbullet; (B); Emission limitations.  andbullet; (C) (1) and (3); Surface coating of automobiles and light dutytrucks.  andbullet; (I) (1) and (2); Surface coating of metal furniture.  andbullet; (K) (1) and (3) and (K)(4) (a), (b) and (c); Surface coating oflarge appliances.  andbullet; (N) (1), (2), and (3) (b) and (c); Use of cutback and emulsifiedasphalts.

NOTE: USEPA is not approving (Z)(1)(a). andbullet; (AA) (1) and (2) (b) and (c); Dry cleaning facility. NOTE: USEPAis not approving (AA)(2)(a).  b. <T3>Discussion of Actions Other than Approvals  </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (A), Applicability  </ITAG>The applicability of this section was revised to include new, as well asexisting, sources of VOC. USEPA is taking no action on this section asit applies to new sources of VOC. New sources are regulated by Ohio's newsource review (NSR) program and USEPA's Prevention of Significant Deterioration(PSD) program. NSR and PSD may require more stringent emission limitationsthan those contained in this rule.  <ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (K)(4), Surface Coating of Large Appliances  </ITAG>Section (4) exempts three Whirlpool Corporation plants from the controlrequirements contained in Paragraph (K)(1). The plants are located in Sandusky,Hancock, and Marion Counties. Marion, Sandusky, and Hancock were designatedattainment areas of the NAAQS for ozone on June 12, 1984 (49 FR 24124).The State implemented an accommodative ozone SIP for these Counties (i.e.,a SIP that is designed to require emission reductions beyond those thatare minimally necessary to maintain the ozone standards, in order to providea margin for future source growth) and they were provided a waiver withrespect to the one year of preconstruction ozone monitoring normally requiredby USEPA's PSD program.  Because USEPA is now approving the exemption from RACT for the WhirlpoolCorporation sources located in Sandusky, Hancock, and Marion Counties (andthe Cooper Tire and Rubber Company in Hancock County discussed elsewhereherein), the State no longer has an accommodative ozone SIP for these Counties.As a result, the waiver from the requirement of one year of preconstructionozone monitoring is terminated for the counties in which these sourcesare located.  Thus, in today's rulemaking action, USEPA is approving the State's exemptioncontained in (K)(4) (a), (b), and (c) for the Whirlpool Corporation plantslocated in Marion, Sandusky, and Hancock Counties, and future sources inthese counties shall comply with the PSD regulations requiring one yearof preconstruction ozone monitoring.  <ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (N)(3) (a) and (e), Use of Cutback and EmulsifiedAsphalts  </ITAG>USEPA is disapproving two amendments to the requirements of Section (N)on the use of cutback and emulsified asphalt in road construction and maintenance.The first amendment extends the exemption period for use of cutback asphaltsin the existing rule by two months, from October 15 through April 15 toSeptember 15 through May 15 of each year, due to problems encountered inusing emulsified asphalt during colder weather. USEPA acknowledges thatemulsified asphalt does not set up properly at temperatures below 50 anddegrees;F.However, OEPA has not yet provided the documentation that USEPA requestedin a letter to OEPA, dated November 17, 1982, on the temperature rangesduring those additional two months that the State permits the use of cutbackasphalts.  The second amendment exempts a maximum daily use of 1000 gallons of cutbackemulsified asphalt when applied by hand for patching or sealing cracks.OEPA states that this exemption is necessary due to a lack of personneltrained to use low-volume emulsified asphalt for road patching. USEPA'sreview of this rule shows that the basis on which the 1000 gallon exemptionis determined is not stated, i.e., per person, crew, district, or County.Furthermore, a lack of training is not sufficient reason for an exemption. <ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (R)(4), Gasoline Dispensing Facilities  </ITAG>USEPA previously conditionally approved this rule on October 31, 1980 (45FR 72122-72143). On June 1, 1984 (49 FR 22814), USEPA removed the conditionson USEPA's approval of this rule for most of Ohio except for the Akron,Cincinnati and Cleveland attainment demonstration areas. This conditionof approval remains outstanding for the Akron, Cincinnati, and Clevelandareas and will be addressed in future rulemaking action.      <ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (U)(2)(f), Surface Coating of Miscellaneous MetalParts and Products</ITAG>OEPA has amended the exemption for this rule by adding (f) (i) and (ii)which apply to new sources. Since USEPA is taking no action on section(A) as it applies to new sources of VOC, USEPA is also taking no actionon these exemptions.<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (U)(2)(i), Surface Coating of Miscellaneous MetalParts and Products</ITAG>USEPA is taking no action on the exemption contained in section (U)(2)(i)granted by Ohio for the Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. motorcycleassembly plant in Marysville. The exemption was granted under Ohio's newsource review program and any further Federal action here is unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (V) Gasoline Tank Trucks</ITAG>OEPA has amended the emission control requirements of section (V) to includea reference to the State's standards leak testing procedures, Method G[Rule 3745-21-10(G)], and a new alternative leak test procedure, MethodH [Rule 3745-21-10(H)]. USEPA is disapproving this section and Rules 3745-21-10(G) and (H), as adopted by the State on January 24, 1983. A discussionof Method H, and USEPA's rationale for disapproving Rule 3745-21-09(V),-10(G) and -10(H) as alternative leak testing procedures, are set forthin Part V.b of this notice. The effect of a final disapproval of theserules is that all owners and operators of such trucks will be subject tothe control requirements in Rule 3745-21-09(V) of the existing SIP. Whenconducting leak tests all owners and operators of such trucks must useonly the standard procedure in Rule 3745-21-10(G), as adopted by the Stateon March 27, 1981, and approved by USEPA as a SIP revision on June 29,1982 (47 FR 28097).<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section(X)(2)(d), Rubber Tire Manufacturing Facility</ITAG>OEPA added section (2)(d) which contains an exemption for the Cooper Tireand Rubber Company facility located in Findlay, Ohio (Hancock County).As stated previously, Hancock County was designated attainment of the NAAQSfor ozone on June 12, 1984 (49 FR 24124), an accommodative ozone SIP wasimplemented in the county, and the county was provided a waiver of theone year preconstruction ozone monitoring requirement in USEPA's PSD program.Because USEPA is now approving the exemption from RACT for the Cooper Tireand Rubber Company (and the Whirlpool Corporation plant discussed above)located in Hancock County, the State no longer has an accommodative ozoneSIP for this county. As a result, the waiver from the requirement of oneyear of preconstruction ozone monitoring required by the PSD regulationsis terminated for Hancock County.<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (Z)(1)(a), Storage of Petroleum in External FloatingRoof Tanks</ITAG>This rule, as approved by USEPA for floating roof storage tanks (47 FR28097; June 29, 1982), required the use of secondary seals for all tanksstoring petroleum liquids. Ohio has amended this section to require onlyone seal, either a mechanical shoe primary seal, a liquid-mounted primaryseal, or the equivalent, on the external floating roof tank if the petroleumliquid being stored is crude oil.OEPA justified this amendment with data showing that retrofitting secondaryseals on storage tanks with liquid mounted primary seals is substantiallymore expensive, per ton of VOC controlled, than retrofitting secondaryseals on other tank types, or retrofitting tanks storing more volatileorganic liquids. USEPA agrees that cost effectiveness may be consideredin modifications to RACT. However, Ohio has not demonstrated that thisrelaxation would not interfere with the timely attainment and maintenanceof the NAAQS for ozone. Without such a demonstration, USEPA cannot approvethe amendment. Therefore, USEPA is disapproving this amendment. USEPA willreconsider this amendment if the State submits the necessary demonstration.c. Other Actions<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (AA)(2)(c), Dry Cleaning Facility</ITAG>This rule as approved by USEPA for perchloroethylene dry cleaning operations(47 FR 28097; June 29,1982) exempted only those operations which were coin-operatedor, due to insufficient steam or space, could not install a control device.OEPA has added section (2)(c) which exempts any facility in which lessthan 60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleaned per year.On October 24, 1983 (48 FR 49007), USEPA proposed to add perchloroethyleneto the list of organic compounds which have negligible photochemical reactivityand, thus, should be exempt from regulation under the ozone SIP. Therefore,USEPA is not taking action on Ohio's amendment regarding perchloroethyleneat this time. However, after USEPA issues its final policy on perchloroethylene,USEPA will take action either approving or disapproving this rule revision.<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (D)(3), Alternative Daily Emission Limitation forCan Coating</ITAG>USEPA approved OAC Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3), an alternative daily emissionlimitation for can coating facilities, on June 29, 1982 (47 FR 28097).However, during USPEA's review of the State's revision to the ozone SIP,USEPA identified the following deficiencies within this rule.This rule presents equations for determining an alternative daily emissionlimitation. USEPA finds that the equations are incorrect in that they arebased on volume of coating used (in gallons, excluding water), which inmany cases can lead to erroneous results. Equivalency calculations forcoatings should be performed on a basis of volume of coating solids usedrather than volume of coating used. (45 FR 80824 gives an example calculationfor can coating done on a volume solids basis.)However, on April 9, 1986, OEPA submitted amendments to its RACT I andRACT II VOC Regulations. One of these revisions corrects the equation sothat it is now on a constant volume solids basis. This revision will bediscussed in a subsequent <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Compliance Test Methods and Procedures, Rule 3745-21-10</ITAG>OEPA has amended this Rule to include a number of minor revisions, correctionsor calssifications; a rule reorganization; and, an alternative method fordetermining the leak tightness of gasoline tank trucks. USEPA is approvingall changes made to Rule 3745-21-10 (B) through (F) and (I) through (K).USEPA is disapproving sections (G) and (H). The following sections of Rule3745-21-10 have been significantly revised.a. Final ApprovalSections:andbullet; (A) (3) and (4); General Provisions.andbullet; (B) (3), (4) and (5); Methods for detemining VOC content of surfacecoating and inks.andbullet; (E) (4) and (7); Method for determining VOC emissions from bulkgasoline terminals.andbullet; (K) Methods for detecting leaks of gasoline vapors.b. Final Disapproval<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (G), Standard Method for the Determination of theLeak Tightness of Gasoline Tank Trucks (Method G)</ITAG>As noted in Part IV.b. of this notice, USEPA is disapproving amended section(G) consistent with USEPA's action on Rule 3745-21-09(V), which USEPA findsto be unapprovable. USEPA believes that the approved SIP currently containsthe control requirements and leak test procedures that are consistent withAgency guidance, and other States' tank certification regulations.The effect of a final disapproval of this rule is that all owners and operatorsof gasoline tank trucks would be subject to Rule 3745-21-09(V) and 10(G),as adopted by the State in March 1981, and approved by USEPA as a SIP revisionon June 29, 1982 (47 FR 28097).<ITAG tagnum="81">andbullet; Section (H), Alternate Method for Determining Leak Tightnessof Gasoline Tank Trucks (Method H)  </ITAG>In today's rulemaking action, USEPA is disapproving the State's alternativetest method, Method H, contained in amended Rule 3745-21-10(H), becausethis method involves a pressure test of only the vapor recovery lines andassociated equipment. To summarize the rule, gasoline tank trucks whichwere manufactured prior to January 1, 1975, must be pressurized to 15 inchesof water and may not sustain a pressure decrease greater than 3.0 inchesof water over 3 consecutive minutes. Gasoline tank trucks which were manufacturedon or after January 1, 1975, must be pressurized to 18 inches of waterand may not sustain a pressure decrease greater than 3.0 inches of waterover 3 consecutive minutes.  The pressure test does not involve pressurization of any compartment ofthe gasoline tank truck. In addition to the pressure test, the followingitems are to be inspected and repaired or replaced if found to be defective: (1) Dome cover lids (gaskets, latch tension and pressure/vacuum vents),  (2) Fusible plugs,  (3) Vapor vent hoods and sealing bands,  (4) Vapor return hoses and any associated fittings and adaptors, and  (5) Any pressure and vacuum relief vents on the vapor recovery lines. Also, the pressure/vacuum vents in the dome assembly covers must complywith certain minimum specifications.  This method is not consistent with USEPA's control technique guidance,nor with the tank truck certification regulations that are in effect in19 other States. In addidion, OEPA has presented no acceptable evidencedemonstrating why this rule constitutes RACT.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Comment Discussion  </ITAG>During the public comment period, a total of two comments were receivedon Ohio's RACT I and II VOC regulations. These comments and USEPA responsesare discussed in the record of this rulemaking.  A brief summary of the comments is discussed below.1. Marathon Pipe Line Company's April 1, 1985, Comment<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Portion of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Which Was Commented UponSection (Z)(1)(a), Storage of Petroleum in External Floating Roof Tanks </ITAG>As discussed above in Section IV.b., Ohio has amended this rule to requireonly one primary seal, or the equivalent, on an external floating rooftank if the petroleum liquid being stored is crude oil. OEPA justifiedthe omission of the secondary seal requirement with cost-effectivenessdata. USEPA agrees that cost-effectiveness may be considered in modificationsto RACT. However, USEPA is disapproving this amendment, because Ohio hasnot submitted a demonstration that shows that this relaxation would notinterfere with timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Summary of Marathon's Comment  </ITAG>Marathon states that it was not aware of the requirement that there bean explicit demonstration that the recision (or relaxation of the rule)would not interfere with the timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQSfor ozone. Marathon feels that the demonstration it presented the OEPA,at the time it requested the revision to the regulations, showed that forcrude oil a primary seal is the equivalent of RACT. Since the States arefree to choose the mix of controls necessary to achieve attainment andmaintenance of the standards, including emission limitations that representRACT, a demonstration of attainment and maintenance is implied by the State'sevaluation of the request and subsequent adoption of the exemption. Marathonis prepared to make and, if necessary, amplify the demonstration made toOEPA at the time it requested the revision.  Marathon is, therefore, requesting that the decision with regard to thedisapproval of this SIP revision be delayed, and that Marathon be givenadequate time to make a presentation similar to that made to the OEPA atthe time of the SIP revison request.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) USEPA Response  </ITAG>This proposed SIP revision constitutes a relaxation of Ohio's federallyapproved ozone SIP. For any relaxation to be approvable, a determinationwould have to be made that the relaxation will not interfere with timelyattainment or maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. No such air quality assessmentwas performed by OEPA.  The demonstration discussed by Marathon deals with the issue of whetherOhio's proposed revision constitutes RACT for crude oil storage in externalfloating roof tanks. While the RACT requirement must also be satisfiedfor these revisons to be approvable, the point of USEPA's finding dealswith the lack of an <T3>air quality demonstration, </T3>as discussed in the preceding paragraph. USEPA is, therefore, unable to approve this relaxation without a demonstrationthat the relaxation will not interfere with attainment or maintenance ofthe ozone NAAQS. USEPA is unable to delay the processing of this SIP revision,unless OEPA requests that it be withdrawn.  USEPA will reconsider this request if the State resubmits it when it submitsan approvable attainment demonstration for the area.2. Comment from John McCarthy<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Portion of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Which Was Commented Upon </ITAG><T3>Section (AA)(2)(c) Dry Cleaning Facility. </T3>As discussed above inSection IV.c., OEPA has added Section (2)(c) which exempts any perchloroethylenedry cleaning facility in which less than 60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleanedper year. USEPA is taking no action on Ohio's amendment regarding perchloroethylenedry cleaning facilities until USEPA issues its final decisions on the reactivityand carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene.<ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Mr. McCarthy's Comment  </ITAG>Mr. McCarthy stated that it might be prudent for a State not to make regulationsless stringent for perchloroethylene because his understanding is thatit is listed as a carcinogen.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) USEPA Response  </ITAG>Perchloroethylene is not formally listed as a carcinogen. However, it hasbeen studied by the National Toxicology Program for carcinogenic properties,and is currently being considered for listing under section 112 of theClean Air Act as a pollutant which is hazardous to human health. If perchloroethyleneis listed under section 112, certain perchloroethylene source categoriesmay be subject to additional emission limitations.  USEPA has not, as yet, published the final notice which will specify whetheror not perchloroethylene is to be added to the list of organic compoundswhich have negligible photochemical reactivity, and, thus, should be exemptfrom regulation under the SIP. USEPA has no basis for requiring more stringentcontrols on perchloroethylene sources at this time.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary of USEPA's Final Action  </ITAG>USEPA is approving all of the June 21, 1982, and January 24, 1983, revisionsto Chapter 3745-21-01, 04, 09, and 10 as submitted by the Director of OEPAto USEPA on March 28, 1983, with the following exceptions:  a. USEPA is disapproving new exemptions for the use of cutback asphalt[OAC Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e)], and for external floating roof(crude oil) storage tanks from the secondary seal requirement [OAC Rule3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a)]. USEPA is also disapproving compliance test methods[OAC Rule 3745-21-09(V) and Sections G and H; OAC Rule 3745-21-10] as alternativeleak testing procedures for gasoline tank trucks.  b. USEPA is not taking action of the applicability of OAC Rule 3745-21-09(A)to new sources of VOC, the gasoline through-put exemption level for gasolinedispensing facilities [OAC Rule 3745-21-09(R)(4)], and the compliance dateextension for Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. auto and motorcycleassembly plant in Marysville [OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(2)(i)].  c. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(AA)(2)(a) which exemptsany dry cleaning facility in which less than 60,000 pounds of fabrics arecleaned per year.  d. USEPA is not taking action on OAC Ruel 3745-21-09(U)(2)(f) (i) and (ii),which apply to new sources (surface coating lines).  No matter what rules the State now enforces, the existing federally approvedSIP regulations for any source will apply, and will be fully enforceable,until the source complies with the new regulations which USEPA approvesas a result of today's final rulemaking on the Chapter 3745-21 revision.Furthermore, the existing SIP regulations will continue in force whereUSEPA disapproves certain new regulations.  Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Anycomments from OMB to USEPA, and any USEPA response, are available for publicinspection at the USEPA Region V office listed above.  Petitions for judicial review of this action under section 307(b)(1) ofthe Act must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by March 20, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements (See section 307(b)(2) of the Act).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  </ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

OAC Chapter 3745-21, entitled ``Carbon Monoxide, PhotochemicallyReactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related Material Standards'', containsOhio's VOC RACT I and II regulations. The amendments to these regulationsare embodied in the OAC as follows: Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01; Attainmentdates and compliance time schedules, Rule 3745-21-04; Control of emissionsof organic compounds from stationary sources, Rule 3745-21-09; and Compliancetest methods and procedures, Rule 3745-21-10. See (c)(15). USEPA is nottaking action on the applicability of Rule 3745-21-09 to new sources ofVOC, to the gasoline throughout exemption level for gasoline dispensingfacilities, and to the compliance date extension for Honda of America Manufacturing,Inc. auto and motorcycle assembly plant in Marysville. USEPA is not takingaction on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(AA))(2)(a) which exempts any dry cleaningfacility in which less than 60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleaned per year.USEPA is not taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(2)(f) (i) and (ii)which apply to new sources (surface coating lines). USEPA is identifyingdeficiencies in the existing Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3) which contains an alternativedaily emission limitation for can coating facilities. USEPA identifiedthe following deficiencies within this rule: This rule presents equationsfor determining an alternative daily emission limitation. USEPA finds thatthe equations are incorrect in that they are based on volume of coatingused (in gallons, excluding water), which in many cases can lead to erroneousresults. Equivalency calculations for coatings should be performed on abasis of volume of coating solids used rather than volume of coating used.(45 FR 80824 gives an example calculation for can coating done on a volumesolids basis.)(i) Incorporation by reference.(A) Amendments to OAC Chapter 3745-21, dated June 21, 1982 and January24, 1983.<T3>(1)</T3> Rule 3745-21-01; Definitions.<T3>(i)</T3> Section (D)(16), (36), and (50), paper and vinyl coating.<T3>(ii)</T3> Section (F)(1-8), asphalts in road construction and maintenance.<T3>(iii)</T3> Sections (E)(8), and (J)(5), corrections to Sections (E)(8)and (J)(5).<T3>(2)</T3> Rule 3745-21-04; Attainment dates and compliance time schedules.<T3>(i)</T3> Section (C)(3), can coating lines.<T3>(ii)</T3> Section (C)(15), cutback and emulsified asphalts.<T3>(iii)</T3> Section (C)(29), gasoline tank trucks.<T3>(iv)</T3> Section (C)(33), External floating roof tanks.<T3>(3)</T3> Rule 3745-21-09; Control of emission of organic compoundsfrom stationary sources.<T3>(i)</T3> Section (B), Emission limitations.<T3>(ii)</T3> Section (C) (1) and (3), Surface coating of automobiles andlight duty trucks.<T3>(iii)</T3> Sections (I) (1) and (2), Surface coating of metal furniture.<T3>(iv)</T3> Sections (K) (1) and (3) and (K)(4) (a), (b) and (c), Surfacecoating of large appliances.<T3>(v)</T3> Sections (N) (1), (2), and (3)(b) and (c), Use of cutbackand emulsified asphalts.

Section 52.1877 is amended by adding new paragraph (b) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 52.1877</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Control strategy: Photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(b) The requirements of andSection; 52.14 are not met by Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3)(a) and (e); Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a); Rule 3745-21-10, Section G; andRule 3745-21-10, Section H, because these Ohio Rules do not provide forattainment and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant (hydrocarbon) standardsthroughout Ohio.(1) USEPA is disapproving new exemptions for the use of cutback asphalt[(Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e)], because Ohio did not provide documentationregarding the temperature ranges in the additional two months that theState permits the use of cutback asphalts, and a lack of training is notsufficient reason for the 1000 gallons exemptions.(2) USEPA is disapproving Section V [Rule 3745-21-09(V)], because it containsan alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks which USEPAfinds to be unapprovable.(3) USEPA is disapproving exclusion of the external floating roof (crudeoil) storage tanks from the secondary seal requirement [Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a)],because Ohio has not demonstrated that the relaxation would not interferewith the timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.(4) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section G, [Rule 3745-21-10]as an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks, becausesuch action on Section G, is consistent with USEPA's action on Rule 3745-21-09(V),which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.(5) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section H, [Rule 3745-21-10],which involves a pressure test of only the vapor recovery lines and associatedequipment. Compliance test method Section H is inconsistent with USEPA'scontrol technique guidances and with tank truck certification regulationsthat are in effect in 19 other States. In addition, OEPA has presentedno acceptable evidence demonstrating why this rule constitutes RACT.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-1133 Filed 1-17-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
