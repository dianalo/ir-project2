They don't want to stay there, he indicated _ just make theirfortunes ``in the land of opportunity'' and return home to live inthe financial comfort that escapes many Brazilians in these days ofeconomic hardship.   In August, 46 Brazilians were discovered stowed away amid sacksof cocoa beans and coffee on a cargo ship docked in Philadelphia.   Forty were from Governado Valadares.   Of the stowaways, nine escaped from U.S. immigration officialsand the rest, who were sent home, vowed to try again.   A lot of the United States has rubbed off on GovernadorValadares. English commonly is heard along with Brazil's Portugueselanguage on its tree-lined streets and in it cheery one-familyhomes. Goods can be paid for in dollars as well as Braziliancruzados.   People speak of traveling to the United States, 4,000 milesnorth, as they do of a jaunt to Rio de Janeiro, 400 miles south.   ``I worked like crazy in the worst jobs to make enough money tolive without worry in Brazil now,'' said Luis DeAmorim, 39, whosaid he spent 20 years living illegally in the United States beforeearning enough money to open a small restaurant in GovernadorValadares.   DeAmorim took 11 members of his family with him when in 1966 hemoved to ``America,'' as they call it here. He lived up and downthe Northeast coast working as a bellboy in hotels, clearing tablesin restaurants and assisting passengers on cruise ships.   ``There's no way to earn money here,'' said Altair Silveira, 40,who first headed northward in 1967, to work illegally on a U.S.tourist visa, and who has returned regularly since being deportedin 1969 to visit his son and daughter-in-law in Florida.   ``In America you can save money to start a decent life, buy ahouse, a car, things you could never have on a Brazilian salary,''he said.   Brazil never has been a major source of illegal emigration tothe United States. But with inflation spiraling at a projectedannual rate of 2,000 percent, unemployment at 25 percent and wages40 percent lower in real terms than they were two years ago, moreand more Brazilians have their eyes on ``America.''   ``The growing number of Brazilians living illegally in theUnited States is a source of concern,'' said Clyde Bishop, head ofthe Consular Section at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. ``Wemust take firmer steps to reverse the trend before there is anexplosion.''   Brazil, Latin America's largest country, has a population ofmore than 143 million.   Though precise figures on illegal aliens are hard to come by,Brazil's Consulate in New York City estimates about 100,000Brazilians live in New York state, half of them illegally. Asimilar number are thought to live in Florida, and thousands morein Boston and Newark, N.J.   According to Brazil's federal police, 1.25 million citizens haveemigrated legally over the past three years to the United States,Canada, Italy, Portugal and Australia. But thousands more simplyoverstayed tourist visas or sneaked into foreign countries.   Some have unpleasant memories of life in ``America.''   ``No one likes living in the United States,'' said Silveira, whowas deported nearly 20 years ago. ``To the contrary, people live insuch awful conditions to save money that they come back with bitterfeelings.''   There is even a bimonthly newspaper for the homesick, theTribuna Brasileira, which is printed in Governador Valadares andsent to some 10,000 Brazilians abroad.   According to Mayor Perim, the city's economy depends on moneyearned in the United States and sent home. Each month, people whohave emigrated send an estimated $3 million to relatives at home,and often the money goes to pay installments on a new home.   In Governador Valadares, new office and apartment buildings haverisen between chic boutiques, jutting above the barren rurallandscape. According to Jose Tavares, who owns a constructioncompany, 46 high rises are currently being built and more than halfwill be higher than 10 floors.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
