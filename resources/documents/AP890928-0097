The demonstration began in the black township of Galeshewe andmoved into Kimberley, where protesters handed a list of demands topolice that included lifting the state of emergency and freeingactivists detained without trial.   Marchers sang and danced and some carried the banners of theoutlawed Communist Party and the African National Congressguerrilla movement.   Volunteer marshalls guided the marchers. Police were present butdid not intervene, and no incidents were reported.   Several dozen whites joined the march.   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across thecountry since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 thatauthorities would not break up peaceful protests given priorapproval by the government.   Most approved rallies in the past two weeks have been peaceful,except for some minor looting at a march last week in thesoutheastern city of Pietermaritzburg.   In Pretoria, police used clubs and dogs Saturday to dispersesome women trying to proceed with a march that was not authorized.   The demonstrations have spread from the major cities ofJohannesburg, Cape Town and Durban to smaller, more conservativetowns such as Kimberley, Oudtshoorn and East London.   They are part of a nationwide protest campaign launched in earlyAugust by anti-apartheid groups opposed to the system of legalracial segregation that denies the black majority a voice innational affairs.   Under the system, the white minority controls the economy andgovernment and maintains separate schools, districts and healthfacilities.   On Tuesday, city officials in Johannesburg voted to open publicamenities such as buses and swimming pools to blacks.   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla movementfighting the government, on Thursday dismissed the move as``insignificant.''   ANC spokesman Tom Sebina, speaking from ANC headquarters inLusaka, Zambia, said the move would only be relevant if apartheidwere abolished throughout the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
