The special election was called after a ``dirty-tricks scandal''rocked the state government last year.   Bjoern Engholm, leader of the state's Social Democrats, and hissupporters had failed to win a majority in elections last September.   But on Sunday, projections said the Social Democrats won 54percent of the vote, assuring the party of 46 of the 74 seats inthe legislature and that Engholm would be governor.   The Christian Democrats were projected to receive about 33percent, a loss of eight percent from September.   Engholm was the target of a smear campaign last year involvingallegations of improper sexual conduct. The campaign was blamed onthen-Gov. Uwe Barschel, who was found dead in a Geneva hotel inOctober. Authorities ruled his death an apparent suicide.   Projected results also showed the Free Democratic Party, whichwas allied with the Christian Democrats in the state's coalitiongovernment, had failed to receive the necessary five percent of thevote to stay in the legislature and lost its four seats.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Sunday night that theSocial Democrats' victory would not negatively affect hisconseravative coalition in the federal government with the FreeDemocrats.   He attributed the Social Democrats' victory to the Barschelaffair.   ``We went into the election from an unusually difficultposition,'' Kohl said.   Last September, neither party could win enough seats to form amajority and elect a new governor.   Barschel remained in office but then resigned when one of hisaides disclosed details about the smear campaign against Engholm inlate September.   The Christian Democrats had entered Heiko Hoffmann, the state'sjustice minister, to run against Engholm in Sunday's balloting.</TEXT></DOC>
