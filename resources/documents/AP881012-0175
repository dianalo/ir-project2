The coalition was billed at a news conference as a switch frompast campaigns to curb pesticides in which environmentalists andfarmers have found themselves at odds.   American Agriculture Movement and the National Farmers Unionofficials on hand praised the coalition's stress on restricting thesupply of farm crops _ and thus raising farm prices _ as a preludeto scaling back pesticide use.   Absent were the National Farm Bureau and other groups thattraditionally represent a broad sweep of agribusiness as well aspolitically influential producer groups, such as the corn, wheatand soybean growers associations. Many farmers remain opposed toadditional pesticide curbs and chilly toward environmentalists.   Environmentalists have been campaigning for 26 years fortightened controls over pesticides, citing evidence that more than50 basic ingredients in chemicals sprayed on U.S. crops causecancer in laboratory animals as well as an array of other healthproblems.   Congress last month approved legislation that would set anine-year deadline for completion of safety testing by theEnvironmental Protection Agency of more than 600 active ingredientsin pesticides. At the current pace, the job would take until theyear 2024, congressional investigators estimate.   Even sponsors of the legislation, however, have been painting itas a bare-bones measure that represented merely the best compromisethat could be reached for the time being. They have been urgingaction next year to combat increasing pesticide contamination ofgroundwater _ the basic drinking supply for an estimated 113million Americans.   At its news conference, the National Toxics Campaign issued a35-page report detailing the pesticide problem. It mainlyrepresented a recycling of data that have appeared in previousdocuments examining the issue.   It called for both control of the supply of agriculturalcommodities and a program of ``integrated pest management,'' aswell as new pesticide curbs.   Supply management, opposed by many farm groups, would go intoeffect under legislation sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, andRep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. Its aim is to prevent enormoussurpluses that drive down farm prices.   A few groups, such as the National Save the Family FarmCoalition, have long been campaigning for such a measure, which wasnevertheless shelved early in the current session of Congress. Theysay better farm prices would offset production losses as a resultof reduced reliance on pesticides.   ``Family farmers are ready to reduce their use of expensive anddangerous chemicals _ but federal policies stand in our way,''Susan Denser of the Family Farm coalition told the news conference.   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, also on hand for the newsconference, said keeping families on the farm was an important goalto avoid ``oligarchy domination of agribusiness plantations.''   Integrated pest managment, another goal of the coalition, standsfor a variety of techniques such as reduced pesticide use, tillingin a manner that protects crops from pests and scouting farm fieldsto avoid needless spraying.   Federal monitoring of pesticides in groundwater and an array ofother measures left out of this year's pesticide bill also arebeing advocated by the coalition as part of a farm bill that may bewritten next year.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group saidcongressional candidates received more than $4 million in campaigncontributions from pesticide manufacturers over the last five years.   The contributions were made by political action committeesoperated by 21 member companies of the National AgriculturalChemicals Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers,the Capitol Hill-based group said. It noted the chemical companies'opposition to groundwater provisions supported by mostenvironmentalists.   ``There is a strong correlation between chemical company ...contributions to a politician and that politician's vote onregulatiion of the chemical industry,'' said Rick Hind of theresearch group.   He said the chemical companies were ``applying agriculturaltechniques to Capitol Hill _ they sow campaign contributions andreap legislation that allows them to operate with minimalgovernment oversight.''</TEXT></DOC>
