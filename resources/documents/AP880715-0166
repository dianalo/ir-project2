(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tammy Bakker defied a request by the PTLbankruptcy trustee that she not visit certain parts of HeritageUSA, and the trustee says he may have to ban the Bakkers completelyfrom the religious theme park.   Mrs. Bakker attended the filming of the ``PTL Today'' televisionshow Thursday, ignoring M.C. ``Red'' Benton's request that theevangelical couple ``voluntarily restrict their activities to thewest side of the railroad tracks'' of Heritage USA.   Jim Bakker's parents live on the grounds west of the tracks, andBenton said Thursday he did not want to limit the couple's accessto them. The studio Mrs. Bakker visited is east of the tracks.   The Bakkers moved back to the area recently to mount their driveto regain control of the PTL ministry, which they lost in 1987 in asex-and-money scandal.   Benton was appointed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to oversee thesale of Heritage USA property to pay PTL's creditors. A buyer isexpected to be named next month. He said he decided to limit theBakkers' access to Heritage USA after several incidents in which hefelt the Bakkers' presence was disruptive.   In one incident, Mrs. Bakker and Russell DeShields, a drummer inthe PTL band, engaged in a shouting match in front of the studioaudience.   Benton said PTL's attorneys contacted the Bakkers' attorney,Ryan Hovis, to ask the couple ``if they were going to deliberatelytest me to see what I would do.''   But Hovis said, ``I don't think that's fair, I don't think it'sright'' for the Bakkers to have to stay away from the ministry theycreated.''   Mrs. Bakker's visit to the studio on Thursday was withoutincident, said PTL security chief Gene Ervin. He said she quietlywatched the show and left before it ended.   ``Everything was nice and calm,'' he said.   Bakker, meanwhile, said he wished Benton had contacted him aboutthe matter directly instead of going through attorneys.   ``I think if Mr. Benton wants to say that he should have thecourtesy to call me or write a letter telling me so,'' Bakker said.``I'll be glad to notify them. If they want to provide security,that's fine.''</TEXT></DOC>
