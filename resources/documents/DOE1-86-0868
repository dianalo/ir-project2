Such a test method requires thatthe material-specific acoustic emission behaviour be previously studiedon specimens and model vessels under quasi-service conditions in theprecritical state of crack initiation, during crack initiation, and duringmacroscopic crack growth. This study must be conducted in conjunctionwith fracture mechanics evaluation methods. For large vessels, acousticemission inspection with flaw locating is liable to substantially addto the information yielded by the usual hydrostatic pressure test. Selectingnon-critical vessels saves excessive costs as would be incurred for conventionaltesting. Exemplified for aluminium piping and swing tubs of centrifuges,it is demonstrated that acoustic emission inspection can be employedfor series testing and automated to a great extent.</TEXT></DOC>
