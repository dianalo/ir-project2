The reservoir was divided and adjustedaccording to its characteristics for development using areal water injectionwith small well spacing technique. During the production, formation pressurewas kept above oil saturation pressure. As soon as responses to waterinjection and water breakthrough occurred, pressure differential wasappropriately augmented to increase single well liquid production rate.The production performance of the conventional cold water injection methodwas enhanced by closely coordinating injection and production scheduling,by developing reservoir potential, and by employing sand control andemulsification techniques for viscosity reduction. 3 refs., 11 figs.,7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
