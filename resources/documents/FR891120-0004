Size standards are needed to establish eligibility for SBA's financialassistance, procurement assistance and other programs. A residual standardeliminates the necessity of separate rulemaking for each industry as requestsarise. The present rule incorporates the size standard of $3.5 millionaverage annual receipts established for the Commodity Contracts Brokersand Dealers industry in an interim rule published on August 9, 1988. Thepresent residual rule does not incorporate or change the size standardof 500 employees established for Natural Gas Distribution in an interimrule published on November 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> December 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Alan Odendahl, Economist, SizeStandards Staff, (202) 653-6373.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> A proposed rule was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 9, 1989 (54 FR 6298) which proposedestablishing a residual size standard of $3.5 million in average annualreceipts for 52 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industries forwhich no size standard now exists. This is the same size standard thatis used as the residual size standard within SIC Division I_Services, forall service industries in that Division not specifically listed with asize standard. No comments have been received to date concerning the proposedrule, either during or after the public comment period which ended March13, 1989.The need for a residual size standard for these uncovered industries wasoriginally signalled in late 1987, when an application for financial assistancewas received by SBA from a firm in the commodity contracts brokers anddealers industry (SIC code 6221). This industry was one of 54 four-digitSIC industries (excluding Division J_Public Administration) for which SBAdid not, at that time, have an established size standard. As a result,SBA established an emergency interim size standard for Commodity ContractsBrokers and Dealers on August 9, 1988 (53 FR 29876).In the latter part of 1988, several Federal agencies contacted SBA regardinga number of current or planned solicitations for natural gas distribution(SIC code 4924). A size standard was needed to identify small and smalldisadvantaged businesses bidding on and receiving those procurements. Again,SBA responded by publishing an emergency interim size standard of 500 employeesfor Natural Gas Distribution on November 25, 1988 (53 FR 47663).Until now, no size standard existed for eight four-digit SIC industrieswithin SIC Division E (Transportation, Communications, Electric, Gas, andSanitary Services); 43 four-digit industries within SIC Division H (Finance,Insurance and Real Estate); and SIC code 9999, Nonclassifiable Establishments(the only industry in SIC Division K (Nonclassifiable Establishments)).This final rule establishes a size standard of $3.5 million in averageannual receipts for these industries. (SIC Division J_Public Administration,remains uncovered; it is totally outside the scope of any of SBA's programs.)Although requests for SBA assistance under any of its programs in these52 uncovered industries are rather rare, the incidents related above showthat they do occasionally occur. Publication of a residual size standardeliminates separate rulemaking as the need recurs in each new industry.The notice of February 9, 1989, proposing the residual size standard, pointedout that none of these 52 industries is included in the economic censusescompiled and published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Data from othersources are scanty and sometimes contradictory on the size structure of(and even the total number of firms in) many of these industries.As explained in the proposed rule, it was judged more appropriate to applyone of the ``anchor standards'' to the uncovered industries, rather thanto adopt and justify some other size standard weakly supported by availableevidence.``Anchor standards'' refer to either of two size standards adopted by SBA'sSize Policy Board in 1985 as reference points from which specific standardsmay vary when supported by statistical evidence. For all receipts-basedsize standards, the anchor standard is $3.5 million and for employee-basedsize standards, 500 employees was adopted as the anchor standard. The latteranchor size standard applies primarily to the manufacturing and miningindustrial divisions. None of the 52 uncovered industries is in eithermanufacturing or mining.The $3.5 million annual receipts anchor standard is the most common standardin effect today for the retail trade and services industries. It representsinflationary adjustments to a single standard of $1,000,000 average annualreceipts established in 1963 for the entire retail trade and services industrydivisions.In addition, the standard adopted herein merely extends to the 52 industries,the same $3.5 million annual receipts figure already in use as the residualsize standard for all industries within SIC Division I_Services which arenot specifically listed in the size standards table (13 CFR part 121.2(d),Table 2) under that Division (49 FR 39996, October 12, 1984; 50 FR 10495,March 15, 1985). If more precise and complete data become available forone or more individual industries, SBA will use authorized rulemaking procedures,including opportunity for public comments, to effect the appropriate adjustments.As indicated above, the initial impetus toward establishment of a residualsize standard came from consideration of the Commodity Contracts Brokersand Dealers industry (SIC code 6221). The reasoning behind applying the$3.5 million annual receipts anchor size standard to this industry wasidentical to that used herein. In addition, no comments were received fromthe public about this interim $3.5 million size standard after publicationon August 9, 1988. For these reasons, instead of a separate publicationof a final rule for commodity contracts brokers and dealers, SBA has decidedto incorporate that rule into the residual rule promulgated herein. Accordingly,the residual size standard of $3.5 million average annual receipts establishedin this rule applies also to Commodity Contracts Brokers and Dealers (SICcode 6221).This final rule, however, does not apply to SIC code 4924_Natural Gas Distribution.The emergency interim size standard for natural gas distribution is 500employees, and a final rule for this industry will either reaffirm the500 employees or adopt some other employee-based standard as deemed appropriate.A standard of $3.5 million average annual receipts appears inordinatelylow for this industry based on a preliminary analysis of its size structure.<ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12291and 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>SBA certifies that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning ofExecutive Order 12291 because it is not expected to have an annual economicimpact of $100 million or more. The economic impact study relating to thisrule is summarized below since it was included in the proposed rule (54FR 6299, February 9, 1989).Based on data in the United States Establishment and Enterprise Microdatafile (USEEM) of SBA's small business data base, there are about 46,700firms in the 52 industries now without SBA size standards. The establishmentof this residual $3.5 million annual receipts size standard makes an estimated34,700 firms eligible for small business set-aside Federal contracts.Because most firms in the finance, insurance and real estate industriesare not eligible for loans under SBA's regulations, a much smaller number,estimated at 13,240 firms, will meet the size eligibility requirementsfor SBA financial assistance. Of those, only a small number of firms arelikely to request financial assistance from SBA. Public utility firms supplyinggas and electric services are usually regulated monopolies in their localitiesand are sufficiently creditworthy to be able to obtain financing withoutSBA guarantees. The same is presumably true of telegraph companies, securitybrokers, functions related to banking, services allied with the exchangeof securities and commodities, and perhaps investment advisors.Data from the Federal Procurement Data Center show $554.5 million of totalFederal procurement in fiscal year 1988 from firms in the 52 industries.If one assumes that small firms with $3.5 million or less in receipts willparticipate in the Federal market in the same proportion as their shareof total industry sales to all buyers, the expected small business shareof Federal procurements would be about $23.3 million. (This 1988 figureis down from the fiscal year 1987 estimate of a $41 million small businessshare of Federal procurement of $467.7 million, as stated in the proposedrule, due mainly to an overestimate of the expected small business sharefor SIC code 4931, Electric and Other Services Combined.)However, there are strong reasons for believing that the actual economicimpact on firms of any size will be considerably less than $23.3 million.Examining Federal procurement data more closely reveals that of total Governmentprocurement of $174.1 billion in fiscal year 1988, $26.7 billion (14.7percent) went to small businesses under sole source, unrestricted or set-asidecontracts. Of this figure, only $11.4 billion, or 42.9 percent was awardedthrough small business set-asides. Another $3.4 billion, or 13.2 percentof the small business total, was awarded under the 8(a) program. Thus,about 56.1 percent of all small business awards result from or are influencedby SBA programs and SBA size standards. The remaining 44 percent of smallbusiness contracts are either noncompetitive or are won by small firmsin unrestricted competition.Taking the above factors together, the expected maximum procurement impactfrom establishing this residual size standard can be estimated roughlyat about $13 million instead of $23.3 million.In the past, firms in these 52 industries have generally not requestedSBA financial assistance. Based on requests received to date in all programs,SBA anticipates that one of the 52 industry size standards would be requiredonly three to four times a year.Accordingly, SBA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Similarly, this regulationis not likely to result in a major increase in costs or prices or havea significant effect on the United States economy. This rule poses no newreporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C., chapter 35. Finally, SBA certifies that this proposed rulewill not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a federalismassessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 121</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government procurement, Governmentproperty, Grant programs_business, Loan programs_business, Recording andrecordkeeping requirements, Small business.Accordingly, part 121 of 13 CFR is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 121_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
