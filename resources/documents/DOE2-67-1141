The overcooling event was initiated by a reactor tripand by an associated stuck-open turbine by-pass valve. The downcomertemperature decreased from 265 deg. C to 215 deg. C in fifteen minutesand high-pressure safety injection was actuated. The plant transientdata have been valuable when thermal-hydraulic methods have been assessedfor applications in Loviisa safety analyses. (author). 2 refs, 11 figs,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
