Separately, the justices allowed prosecutors investigating laborunion corruption in New York to use subpoenaed membership listsobtained from four carpenters union locals.   The high court said it would hear a case involving the Pittsburghandamp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. in Pennsylvania and Ohio to resolve issuestroubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide.   At issue is the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commissionto exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they sell raillines. A key related question involves the authority of federalcourts to block strikes in such cases.   The Reagan administration supported the ICC's plea that the courtsettle the issues, which have generated disagreement among lowercourts.   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year the Pandamp;LEmay not sell 182 miles of rail line in western Pennsylvania andeastern Ohion without engaging in collective bargaining.   The appeals court said the federal Railway Labor Act requires therailorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposedsale would have in eliminating jobs.   The appeals court also ruled that federal courts lack authorityto block a strike by the workers.   The appeals court said federal law deprives federal judges of thepower to bar strikes in such circumstances. The appeals courtrejected the railroad's arguments that the act may be set aside incases where the ICC has approved proposed rail line sales.   The financially troubled Pandamp;LE announced in July 1987 it wouldsell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned tooperate the lines with fewer workers.   The ICC approved the plan without requiring the railroad toengage in collective bargaining with its unions, which then called astrike in September 1987.   Pandamp;LE currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines otherthan the newly formed company, called Railco.   The ICC adopted a process to streamline sales by relievingrailroads of any obligation to bargain with employees.   Also Monday, the high court rejected an appeal by labor unions ina related action that challenged the sale of 208 miles of trackbetween Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wis., by Chicago andamp; North WesternTransporation Co.   In the carpenters union case, the court let stand without commenta ruling that the rights of the union and its members were notviolated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists.   A Manhattan grand jury in February 1987 issued subpoenas for themembership lists of the locals in connection with a probe of theUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners by District AttorneyRobert M. Morgenthau.   The New York Court of Appeals ruled last July Morgenthau's officecould keep the lists pending completion of the grand juryinvestigation.   The state court said forcing the unions to turn over the listsand allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did notviolate free-association rights of the union and its members.</TEXT></DOC>
