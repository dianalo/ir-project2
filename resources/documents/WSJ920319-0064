It stars a belly dancer known as Fifi, who plays acharacter who is raped on screen at the age of eight, beforethe opening titles roll. She grows up to marry a sadist, whowhips and burns her. Amid the abuse, she belly dances, ofcourse.</LP><TEXT>   But &quot;Lady Killer&quot; adds a radical twist to the usualmass-appeal Arab film: Fifi fights back. Demented from herpain, the heroine seduces men off the streets, brings them tothe verge of satisfaction, and plunges a knife in theirbacks. She is hanged for her crimes, but not before a policedetective uncovers her tortured past, resigns his post insympathy and becomes her lawyer.   &quot;Lady Killer&quot; isn't sophisticated drama. And thoughcritics here expect the racy film to be a blockbuster when itopens in April, it isn't even very good.   It is, however, one of the most violent film depictionsever of an Arab woman's rage against men -- a kind ofEgyptian version of the American TV movie, &quot;The Burning Bed.&quot;&quot;Lady Killer&quot; joins a small but growing number of Egyptianmovies -- including some big hits in the male-dominated Arabworld -- in which women rise up and get even.   &quot;Most men, I don't care how rich or educated they are,they're all the same when it comes to sex,&quot; says Inasel-Degheidy, &quot;Lady Killer's&quot; director and co-writer. Sheconceived the plot two years ago, she says, after a rash ofhusband-killings and dismemberments hit Cairo. &quot;Some awfulthings must have happened to those women to make them dothat,&quot; she says.   Egypt's movie industry -- the world's third-most-prolific,after those of the U.S. and India -- is still a man's world,much like Hollywood. Only a half-dozen or so women directorswork in &quot;Cinema Town,&quot; the giant complex of movie studioshere that produce some 60 films a year for a potentialaudience of 300 million Arabs.   But thanks to the huge spread of video recorders in homes,women -- who don't dare tread in most Arab movie theaters --are the fastest-growing group of film watchers in theMideast. These new videophiles, along with easing statecensorship, have given an audience, and a voice, to theMideast's hottest conflict: the one between the sexes.   Meet Fauzi, a Cairo bank manager in the 1989 hit comedy,&quot;Gentleman,&quot; by Raafat el-Meahy. Fauzi flirts a lot in theoffice, he chain-smokes, he beats up his spouse, and he takesup with a lover -- just what you would expect from the malelead.   But Fauzi is really Fauzia, a beleaguered housewife andbank teller, who gets a sex-change operation to join &quot;thekingdom of men.&quot; Suddenly, Fauzi's parents dote on their newson -- as they never did on Fauzia -- and the bank promotesthe converted male to management. After Fauzi roughs up hiserstwhile husband in a scene of gleeful revenge, thebewildered man comes to heel and becomes the household's cookand cleaner.   &quot;Women's eyes always light up when Fauzi gives the husbanda good pounding,&quot; says Mr. Meahy, one of Egypt's most highlyacclaimed filmmakers. &quot;Arab women can't ever do that, exceptin my films.&quot;   Some want to, though. &quot;I know lots of highly educatedwomen who have the idea of killing their husbands,&quot; saysLamees al-Hadidi, a 25-year-old graduate of AmericanUniversity in Cairo. &quot;I'm talking about some of Egypt'sfinest families. Women have lots and lots of frustrations inour society, and killing is sometimes the only expressionthey have.&quot;   Ms. Degheidy and Mr. Meahy are sometimes castigated forfeaturing contemptible men alongside virtuous women in theirfilms.   &quot;Inas el-Degheidy definitely goes out of her way to makemen look bad,&quot; says Yusri Kheir, an Egyptian film buff whoworks at a hotel.   Ms. Degheidy, who has portrayed the battle of the sexes inprior movies as well, has received death threats fromreligious fanatics. As for Mr. Meahy, after &quot;Gentleman&quot;became a hit, some prominent Muslim clerics called on thegovernment to arrest him for blasphemy and &quot;crimes againstnature,&quot; he says. (The government declined to act.)   &quot;My corner grocer asked me why I let women insult men inmy films,&quot; says Mr. Meahy, one of several male directors herewho have seized on the poor lot of Arab women to draw largeaudiences. &quot;What can you say to someone like that? I laughedand told him I hated my wife.&quot;   Censorship in Egypt has relaxed considerably since therigorous controls of the 1960s and '70s. The government stillscrutinizes local films at various stages of development. Butunless a movie involves graphic sex, religion or recognizablepolitical figures, it is usually left alone. In &quot;LadyKiller,&quot; only one frame of the rape scene had to be cut.   &quot;I expect conservatives to attack this film, but theaudience will love it, especially women,&quot; says MustafaMuhara, a screenwriter and one of the censorship committeemembers who cleared &quot;Lady Killer&quot; for distribution.   Elsewhere, though, censors are stricter. Those in SaudiArabia and other Persian Gulf countries -- whose hardcurrency usually contributes about 50% of an Egyptian film'srevenue -- tore into Mr. Meahy's &quot;Gentleman.&quot; They excisedall dialogue discussing why an Arab woman would ever chooseto become a man, the film maker says. Most of the movieremained, however, and was a hit at video stores and intheaters.   Gulf censors also sliced up Mr. Meahy's next film, &quot;Ladiesand Gentleman.&quot; In that movie, four young women liveblissfully in a Cairo apartment. They have good jobs, moneyto spend and lots of freedom -- the last thing they want arehusbands. But marriage pressures mount, so they devise aplan: Since Islamic law allows a man to chose four wives, whycan't four wives choose a man?   &quot;We need a man we can own, not who owns us,&quot; theringleader says.   They borrow a government computer to search for acandidate who loves life and hates sex. No one fills thebill. Finally, they pick a physicist who works as an errandboy. The man can't believe his good fortune, until herealizes none of his wives will have him on her schedulednight -- &quot;it's a woman's right to judge when,&quot; they say --and he gets relegated to the kitchen.   The Gulf censors wouldn't countenance the scenes of wivesrejecting sex, so they were cut, Mr. Meahy says.   It is too early to know how Egypt's more daring films willinfluence attitudes within the Arab world. Ms. Degheidycomplains that her first movie -- about a woman who shootsher husband and his lover -- failed to push Egypt to amendits law that gives men virtual immunity to kill unfaithfulwives, but punishes women severely for the same crime.   &quot;When a man shoots his wife, it's to defend his honor,&quot;explains a farmer in the film. &quot;Women have no honor.&quot;   The best of Egypt's films on the struggle of the sexes is&quot;Dreams of Hind and Camelia,&quot; by Mohammed Khan. The &quot;Thelmaand Louise&quot; type story chronicles the lives of two servantgirls, who are beaten and robbed, impregnated, married andabandoned by a slew of horrible men. Only their vibrantfriendship with each other lets them endure.   &quot;It shows women can do without men, if they have to,&quot; saysMr. Khan, whose movie won awards at film festivals in Seattleand Valencia, Spain, in 1989.   Ms. Hadidi, the young, single college graduate, says sheknows many women who would prefer a life without men. &quot;Iguess films are beginning to show the real struggle ofEgyptian women to obtain their freedom from society and men.Personally, I can understand why a woman would try to killher husband.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
