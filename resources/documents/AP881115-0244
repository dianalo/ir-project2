The Washington Post, quoting what it called documents andunidentified sources familiar with the case, said Tuesday that thesubject of SEC scrutiny was a group of about a dozen Penn graduates,some of them former fraternity brothers, a number of whom areprofessional stock speculators.   The newspaper said the SEC's New York office began theinvestigation last year after it was tipped by a confidentialinformant that the group was obtaining non-public information abouttakeovers from a number of investment banks. including DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. No charges have been filed.   Lawrence Iason, the SEC's regional administrator in New York,declined to comment on the Post story. The enforcement agencyordinarily does not comment on pending investigations.   The Post's account suggested that at least part of theinvestigation overlapped with some of the other highly publicizedprobes that have stemmed from the Ivan Boesky insider trading casetwo years ago.   Boesky, once the best-known speculator on Wall Street, turnedstate's evidence after paying the SEC a record $100 million inpenalties for insider trading. He also pleaded guilty to a criminalcharge of conspiracy to lie to the SEC and is serving a three-yearprison term.   The biggest target of Boesky's cooperation so far has beenDrexel, which is battling major civil-fraud charges by the SEC andmay face criminal indictments soon. Drexel has denied any wrongdoing.   The Post said one of the Penn alumni allegedly underinvestigation is Bruce Newberg, a former Drexel trader indicted afew months ago in a criminal securities and tax fraud case involvinga small New Jersey investment firm.   The newspaper account did not identify all the other Penn alumniallegedly subjected to SEC scrutiny, but said four declined tocomment and one denied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
