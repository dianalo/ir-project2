(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of angry blacks looted or burnedstores and held off authorities with rocks and bottles early todayafter a black man was fatally shot in what one witness described asa drug deal gone sour, police said.   Two white females were arrested after the shooting at a park,described by police as an area with drug problems. One of them,Tamala C. Vergo, 17, was later booked on a charge of second-degreemurder, according to police records.   Police would not elaborate on the murder charge. The other womanwas questioned but not immediately charged.   During the rock-throwing, a seven-block area was cordoned offand police warned motorists to stay away. Police Chief CharlesGruber said the crowd could have been as big as 1,000 people at theheight of the disturbance, but most estimates put the figurebetween 300 and 500 during most of the evening.   This northwestern Louisiana of 250,000, the state's secondlargest after New Orleans, has been the scene of recent racialtension stemming from a shooting of a black teen last month. Butpolice said drug problems may also have fueled the disturbance.   A man who identified himself as a cousin of shooting victimWilliam David McKinney said that McKinney was a bystander to a drugdeal that went sour. The man, who would give his name only asCharles, talked to reporters after being interviewed by detectivesas a witness to the shooting.   Charles said a woman had tried to buy some cocaine from a groupof men, and when they ran away with her purse, she ``took out herfrustration'' by shooting at McKinney.   McKinney, 20, of Shreveport, died at 12:10 a.m. today of agunshot wound to the head, police said.   Reba White, 22, said she was at a convenience store when theshooting happened in the nearby park about 9:45 p.m. Tuesday. Therock-throwing started when officers took the two women inside thestore and a crowd gathered outside, she said.   ``That's when the riot happened,'' she said. ``They werethrowing bottles and anything that was there.'' She said theshooting victim lived in the area and those throwing rocks were hisfriends.   The disturbance was not brought under control until about 3a.m., said police Sgt. Rick Ware. Police said early today that fourpeople were taken into custody in connection with the riot, butWare said there was no record of charges being filed by late thismorning.   The building housing the convenience store and a liquor storewas burned to the ground. Looting or fires were also reported inanother convenience store, a service station and a second liquorstore.   No police or demonstrators were reported seriously injured,although some were treated at hospitals and released, authoritiessaid. Several were hit by rocks and bottles.   Gruber said a brick came through the windshield of his car,which was also hit by automatic weapons fire, but he said he wasnot hurt.   A car owned by KTBS-TV was set ablaze, while a fire truck thatarrived to fight the blazes was attacked by protesters, who beat itwith bats and clubs after firefighters abandoned the vehicle,according to reporters at the scene.   About 200 police were called in, Gruber said, includingreinforcements of state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and officersfrom nearby Bossier City. They pulled back during the melee and didnot fire their weapons, Gruber said.   ``We chose to let it cool off,'' he said. ``We felt our presencewould do nothing but accelerate it.''   Community leaders rushed to the area to help get the crowd undercontrol. Mayor John Hussey, Gruber and other city officials metwith black community leaders late this morning to try to head offany further trouble, police said.   ``We've had considerable drug problems in this area,'' saidGruber. ``I think that's something that might be fueling this.''   During the disturbance, some in the crowd shouted ``HotBiscuit,'' the name of a restaurant where a white man fatally shota black teen-ager Aug. 4.   Five white men were arrested in that case. One of the fiveadmitted to the shooting, but said it was self-defense. That man isbeing held on $250,000 bond on second-degree murder charges.Charges against three of the others were dropped in return fortheir cooperation.   The earlier shooting enraged Shreveport's black community, butblack ministers urged their congregations to let authorities handlethe investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
