The three mainmethods i.e. direct-heating method, mixing or drop method, and flow methodare all described, along with their corresponding calorimeters. Experimentalinvestigations into enthalpy and heat capacity of alkali metals in condensedphase using the direct-heating method are discussed. Also a descriptionof the experimental apparatus employing the drop method is given. Othermethods of investigating the thermodynamic properties of alkali methodsare outlined. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
