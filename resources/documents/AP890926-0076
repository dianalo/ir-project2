U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima on Monday said Midler maynot sing in court at the trial, which will decide whether Ford andthe Young andamp; Rubicam ad agency used a ``sound-alike'' to impersonateher in a 1985 car commercial.   Lawyers for Ford and the ad agency sought the ruling, contendingthat Midler might alter her voice in court to mimic the singer inthe commercial.   Midler's lawyer, Peter Laird, said it hasn't been decidedexactly how her music will be presented to the jury.   Young andamp; Rubicam hired a former backup singer for Midler to sing``Do You Want to Dance'' in a Mercury Sable commercial afterMidler's manager turned down an opportunity for her to sing in theTV ad, the court said.   Midler, known to music fans as ``The Divine Miss M,'' sued in1987.   A judge threw out the case, saying the ad agency had acted like``the average thief'' but broke no law. But an appeals courtreinstated the lawsuit last year, ruling that ``to impersonate hervoice is to pirate her identity.''   The singer-actress recently has focused her talents on movieroles in such films as ``Beaches,'' ``Outrageous Fortune'' and``Big Business.''</TEXT></DOC>
