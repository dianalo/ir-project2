Ask technology gurus about the future of consumerelectronics, and that is what a lot of them talk about. Smarthomes, smart appliances, smart phones -- everyday items witha high-tech finish.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Up until now, we've had simple-type products,&quot; says HideoMori, the publicity manager for Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co.'s home-appliance sector. &quot;Now, we'd like toinclude intelligence in that equipment.&quot;   Many of tomorrow's contraptions already are on display inJapan, where the world's leading electronics makers testtheir wares. Here's a glimpse of the future from a recenttechno-tour of Tokyo.                                                                                                          Smart Homes                                                                                                          The ultimate vision for home electronics is the electronichome.   One of the most advanced abodes is just a 10-minute walkfrom the center of Tokyo. Approach the TRON Pilot IntelligentHouse, and the lights turn on. Inside, you can drop yourbriefcase in a bin in the closet; the briefcase isphotographed and whisked to the basement. (Later, you turn ona video monitor and scroll through the pictures of as many as10 bins. When you see the one you want, you select it, andthe briefcase is whisked back to the closet.)   The bath is already drawn; you set the timer by phonebefore leaving the office. To cook a Chinese meal, punch acouple of buttons on the combination oven/VCR. A video showsyou how to prepare the dish of your choice, while the oventurns on at the appropriate moment. Don't worry aboutwatering the plants; sprinklers turn on by themselves. If itstarts to rain, the windows close.   Then there's the toilet: A remote-control unit adjusts thestrength, direction, and temperature of the water spewingfrom the bidet, while an attached computer conducts adetailed urinalysis and blood-pressure test. Sensors cut theneed for the disease-spreading human touch by flushing thebowl automatically as well as turning the sink on and off.   The two-story home -- which isn't available for occupancybut does take occasional guests -- is controlled by wires,cameras, and sensors running through the walls and ceilingsleading to an underground central computer. Eighteen Japanesecompanies, including Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.,Mitsubishi Electric Corp., and Seibu Department Stores Ltd.,cooperated to complete the home in December 1989.   TRON, which stands for The Realtime Operating SystemNucleus, is the creation of Ken Sakamura, a Tokyo Universityassociate professor. It is, he hopes, just the firstmanifestation of his vision. The sponsors are plotting a TRONvillage in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba, and Mr. Sakamura dreamsof the day when the whole world will run harmoniously onTRON.                                                                                                          Smart Home Buying                                                                                                          Japanese home buyers are using computer-intelligence todesign their houses. In April, a Matsushita subsidiary set upa test showroom where prospective shoppers can &quot;walk through&quot;a three-dimensional computer blueprint of their kitchen.   The exercise relies on an emerging technology called&quot;virtual reality.&quot; The user puts on headgear made up of twosmall television sets and a pair of stereo speakers, as wellas a glove with fiber-optic sensors. A computer detects theperson's hands and head movements from the sensors, thensends images and sounds to give the sensation of movement. Ahome buyer, for instance, can &quot;walk&quot; through the kitchen,turning on the sink and opening cupboards.   Smart Appliances                                                                                                          First there was fuzzy. Then came neuro-fuzzy. Soon, theremay be chaos.   Those are terms used for the types of artificialintelligence that have rapidly moved into home appliances inJapan over the past two years. There are fuzzy-logic washingmachines that adjust the cycle length depending on how dirtythe clothes are, fuzzy-logic cameras that, ironically,improve focus, fuzzy-logic microwave ovens that claim to&quot;simulate a cook's judgment&quot; in setting the temperature andcooking time, and neuro-fuzzy vacuum cleaners that adjust tothe type of dirt on the floor.   Matsushita says that 40% of its washing machines arefuzzy, and that it expects within five years to embed fuzzyor neuro-fuzzy logic controllers in all of its homeappliances. While the fuzzy-logic products are sold mainly inJapan, manufacturers plan to start exporting them to the U.S.soon.   The main advantage of fuzzy logic is that it is lessprecise than conventional computer logic. Instead of yes-nodecisions, it adjusts the machine to conditions like &quot;sortof,&quot; which makers say allows smoother operation. Aconventional air conditioner, they claim, turns on or offwhen the room reaches the preset temperature, while a fuzzyunit would phase in and out, saving energy, reducing noise,and improving comfort.   Neuro-fuzzy takes that a step further by using so-calledneural networks that allow fuzzy systems to &quot;learn.&quot; Chaos,which makers say is still under study, purports to be able torespond to an even greater set of seemingly &quot;chaotic&quot;variables.                                                                                                          Compact Disks                                                                                                          The optical storage disk, better known as the compactdisk, got its first popular exposure a decade ago as areplacement for vinyl records.   But that is just scratching the surface, so to speak, ofthe technology's potential. The disk -- on which informationis recorded by heating spots with a laser, then retrieved byanalyzing lasers reflected through the spots -- can hold moreinformation and retrieve it faster than other types ofstorage technology.   So if the compact disk can be used for sound, why notother types of information, such as graphics or pictures? Ifit can be used to play prerecorded information, why not useit to record information as well?   Some new applications are making their way to market.Pioneer Electronic Corp. is enjoying booming sales in Japanand in the U.S. for its laser disk video players (which, likecommon CD players, can play but not record). Computer opticaldisks are slowly spreading, although technical difficultiesstill exist.   Sony Corp. last year placed on sale in Japan the DataDiscman -- an electronic book that stores full encyclopediason a single disk -- and plans to export them to the U.S.soon.   Sony also hopes to replace the conventional audio cassettewith the mini disk, which is slated for release late nextyear. The mini disk records as well as plays music. Pioneerlast month unveiled a video-disk recorder that willultimately compete with videocassette recorders.                                                                                                          Picture Phones                                                                                                          The product of the future since the 1960s, videophones mayfinally come of age in the 1990s. Again, we said may. A Julystudy by Japan's Economic Planning Agency declared it one ofthe most promising new consumer technologies, predicting anannual market of 10 billion yen (about $75 million) by 1994and twice that by 2000.   Already, large video-conferencing systems selling for lessthan $20,000 are spreading, but various technical advancesfor the personal phone are still necessary. A big hurdle willbe passed over the next few years with the expansion inJapan, the U.S. and Europe of telecommunications networksthat can transmit up to 1.5 billion bits of information persecond over phone lines (25,000 times the current maximum).   Hitachi Ltd. begins shipping in Japan this month what itclaims is &quot;the world's first all-in-one desktop videophone&quot;for 950,000 yen (about $7,000). The picture is still a bitjerky -- 15 frames per second compared with 30 frames fornormal television. But the machine takes up only about 30cubic centimeters of space, about one-fifth the volume ofprevious such products.   Despite the technical advances, however, skeptics remain.Takahiro Ozawa, a researcher at a Japanese telecommunicationsthink tank, is conducting a public-opinion survey on thesubject. His conclusion so far: &quot;Average people don't likethe idea -- they don't want to be seen in that machine.&quot;                                                                                                          Navigation                                                                                                          For centuries, maps and compasses have helped people findtheir way. But they have always had limits. They are not muchhelp if you have no idea where you are. And they can't tellyou exactly how to get where you want to go.   That's beginning to change.   Two American companies, Magellan Systems Corp. and TrimbleNavigation Ltd., have been selling portablesatellite-navigation systems for some time. Sony, typically,is trying to push the technology closer to the mass consumermarket by making it much smaller. Last month, it startedselling its hand-held, 590-gram, battery-operated Pyxis(named for the constellation symbolizing a compass) in Japan,the U.S. and Europe for about $1,000, hoping to attractcampers and mountain climbers. Pyxis gives you an exactcompass reading with lattitude and longitude bearings; withthat information, you can whip out a map and find out whereyou are.   Various companies, such as Philips Electronics N.V.,Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., and Pioneer, are sellingcar-navigation systems that display the driver's location ona dashboard screen. Some can be programmed to plot the routeto specific destinations.   Still, these products have their limits. The measurementsaren't always so precise. And the satellite transmissionsused by some of the products don't work near tall buildingsor other obstructions.                                                                                                          On the Road                                                                                                          Though the radio and the tape player have become standardfare in cars, and the cellular phone is spreading, the spacein front of and next to the wheel is relatively gizmo-free.   But not for long. The new navigation systems are only oneexample. Companies are creating better and cheaper car phones-- particularly as the technology shifts to thehigher-quality digital-transmission system -- as well as carfaxes and television sets. Next April, a new Hitachi andNissan Motor Co. joint venture will begin making andmarketing automobile audio and video equipment, mobilephones, and navigation equipment. &quot;All signs are that the carinformation and communications sector is now at the thresholdof a long period of rapid growth,&quot; the companies said whenannouncing the venture.                                                                                                          Working at Home                                                                                                          The movable office -- a godsend for workaholics, anightmare for those who live with them -- has only justbegun.   With the business market for facsimile machines largelysaturated, companies in Japan are heavily promoting faxes forpersonal use. Advertisements in Japan feature the convenienceof faxing party invitations, even marriage proposals. Somestudies say nearly two-thirds of all fax sales in Japan nowgo to homes and small offices, up from practically nil fiveyears ago.   Companies are marketing cordless fax machines and faxmachines combined with copiers. Toshiba in July introduced inJapan a new personal machine for 149,000 yen (about $1,100)that cuts unnecessary paper use. A display screen shows thecontents of the fax, and the user only prints out the desiredmessages. The machine also has a scanner, which allows directtransmission from books and newspapers without having to feeda separate hard copy through the machine.                                                                                                          HDTV                                                                                                          Two years ago, high-definition television topped virtuallyevery list of pending revolutionary home technologies.Fantasies about super-crisp pictures on flat screens thathang from the wall blended with scare stories about how Japanwill use the sets to clinch its world domination.   As with most promising technologies, however, the initialwave of hype is now settling into skepticism. Many of thecritical components are proving difficult to develop,especially at a price acceptable to consumers. A lot ofso-called high-definition technologies are already seepinginto regular television sets -- such as large,high-resolution screens -- diminishing the advantages ofpaying the hefty premium for a completely new type of TV.Besides, the U.S. and Europe are almost certain to adopt adifferent HDTV transmission standard than Japan's, making ittough for the Japanese makers to drive down costs with volumeproduction.   While government and industry once hoped to grab 10% ofthe Japanese TV market by 1995, demand &quot;will probably belower,&quot; concedes Takashi Fujio, director of Matsushita's HDTVdevelopment center and a pioneer of the Japanese effort.   Still, the market is slowly evolving. The Japanese makersare pushing industrial uses, such as training tools formedical students who can watch surgery on a large screen, orart museums that can display paintings &quot;borrowed&quot; from otherinstitutions.   In Japan, eight hours of daily commercial broadcastingwill begin next month. The first consumer sets went on salefor about four million yen (about $30,000) at the end of lastyear, and a new generation of boxes are expected to hit themarket in the next few months. &quot;There might be a kind ofwait-and-see attitude at the moment,&quot; says Mr. Fujio, &quot;butthis will change as the market develops.&quot;   ---   Mr. Schlesinger is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Tokyo bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
