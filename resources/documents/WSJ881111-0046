For the first time since the 1940s, workers can be employed in their own homes to make gloves and mittens, embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and certain jewelry. The commercial manufacturing of women's apparel in the home would still be prohibited.    Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin said the government will require the certification of employers using in-the-home workers and will monitor those workers' wages and hours worked. She said that permitting the practice offers a measure of flexibility and economic freedom to the women, handicapped and older workers who may want to work in their homes.    The department in 1981 and 1986 sought broader repeal of the ban, but ran into stiff union opposition and saw some of its efforts blocked in court. In 1984 a ban on knitted outerwear was repealed, however. The new changes, which were proposed last March, take effect Jan. 9.    The International Ladies Garment Workers Union again said it will challenge the decision in court. It contends that the Labor Department can't ensure fair labor practices through the proposed employer-licensing process. Some employers will ignore safety and child-labor laws, and will impose poor wages and long hours on in-the-home workers, the union contends. </TEXT></DOC>
