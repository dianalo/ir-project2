The CIA had been supplying the Contras, but by October 1984 whenCongress banned further military aid ``every bit of that CIAresponsibility had been passed on to me,'' North told the jury athis criminal trial Thursday. ``It was basically a handoff as inbasketball.''   The former National Security Council aide took the witness standin his own defense for nearly 2{ hours. The 12 criminal chargesagainst him focus on his alleged lies to Congress and the attorneygeneral about his efforts on behalf of the Contras.   Then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane told him hisrole as overseer of the Contra network ``could not be revealed,''North testified.   The admonition ``was reiterated innumerable times by AdmiralPoindexter and by Director Casey,'' said North, referring toMcFarlane's successor John Poindexter and CIA Director WilliamCasey.   North said his superiors told him disclosure ``would jeopardizethe people doing it, the pilots shipping supplies'' and others inthe aid network. In addition, public exposure would ``jeopardizethe CIA's ability to move back in'' because publicity would make itless likely Congress would restore military assistance.   North's testimony was preceded by a series of new disclosuresabout the Reagan administration's secret assistance to the Contras.Among the revelations in the written admissions of fact:   _Vice President George Bush was an intermediary in a secret planapproved by Reagan and disclosed earlier at North's trial to slipHonduras an extra $110 million in aid if it would help support theContras. Bush told President Roberto Suazo that ``President Reaganhad directed expedited delivery of U.S. military items toHonduras'' as well as other steps helpful to Honduras.   _North met in London in mid-1986 with Panamanian strongmanManuel Noriega, who ``would try to take immediate actions againstthe Sandinistas.'' Noriega offered a list of priorities including``an oil refinery, an airport and the Puerto Sandino off-loadfacility.''   _In an earlier meeting, a representative of Noriega had said thePanamanian leader was offering to ``assassinate the Sandinistaleadership for the U.S. government.'' In exchange he wanted apromise from the U.S. government to help clean up Noriega's imageand a commitment to lift the U.S. ban on military sales to thePanamanian military. U.S. law forbade assassinations, North toldthe representative, who countered by pointing to Noriega's help tothe U.S. government ``the previous year in blowing up a Sandinistaarsenal.'' When North reported back to his boss, Poindexter saidthe U.S. government ``could not be involved in assassination, butPanamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story.''   _In early 1985, President Reagan ``urged the head of state ofSaudi Arabia to continue its support for the resistance. SaudiArabia subsequently made a contribution of more than $25 million.''   _In a scheme initiated by Casey and known as Operation TippedKettle, Israel on two occasions secretly supplied the DefenseDepartment with weapons it had confiscated from the PLO. The CIAadvised Congress the weapons would be used for various purposes,but ``in fact many of them were provided'' to the Contras ascongressionally appropriated funds ran out. The Defense Departmentsaid it would find a way to compensate Israel for its assistance.   In his testimony, North said that when he needed to set up asecret shipping network to funnel supplies to the rebels, he wentto Casey and got the name of Richard Secord.   At the time, Saudi Arabia was pouring at least $1 million amonth into Contra bank accounts, but ``I told Casey all the moneyin the world'' wouldn't keep the rebels in the field.   ``He basically created a mirror image outside the CIA,'' Northsaid of the network of private companies Secord set up to supplythe rebels. Charged in the Iran-Contra affair with North, Secordwill be tried separately later.   North depicted himself as a military officer trying to do hisjob and looking forward to heading for Camp Lejeune to command aMarine battalion after a grueling stint at the National SecurityCouncil in Washington.   ``You had been there three years?'' at the NSC, asked Sullivan.   ``Three years too long,'' replied North.</TEXT></DOC>
