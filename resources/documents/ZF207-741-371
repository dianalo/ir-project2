Dvorak I was invited to speak before a financial-systems softwarefirm about the future of desktop computing.andP;  The CEO was concerned, though,that I might say something like &quot;Windows is dead.&quot;andP;  This, he felt, wouldconfuse the users to whom he intends to sell a fancy window-based product.andM;He explained that he was having enough trouble with field offices and theirold equipment and their constant demand for DOS-based applications.andP;  Hisobservation was simple: the main offices around the country were upgrading tonewer equipment, as needed; the field offices in Podunk, Idaho, were stayingwith the PC-XT.andM;This observation is not lost on me as I go to a local garage owner anddiscover a PC-XT--class machine in his office.andP;  Discussions concerningupgrading are met with a large smile.andP;  Curiously, a year ago users just likehim were concerned about the status of their investment in PC technology andworried sick about obsolescence.andP;  Enough time has passed for them to becomeadamant about the PC-XT and its position in the world.andP;  Now they all use thebottom-line &quot;we can't throw away our investment&quot; excuse for keeping thebeast.andM;I'm convinced that if there were a viable used-computer market, then many ofthese old clunkers would be recycled out of the big-business environment andinto homes and schools and flower shops where they belong.andM;During the heyday of the American automobile industry, the American used-carsystem was the most efficient in the world.andP;  We all know how, for example, inthe 1950s and early 1960s many people were able to have a new car every yearby trading in the previous year's model.andP;  The system encouraged the practice,especially among owners of cars like Cadillacs and Lincolns.andM;Gradually, industry restructuring, imports, interest rates, and other changesin the economy altered the U.S.andP;  automobile industry forever, and theused-car scene never adjusted.andP;  Few people nowadays have a new car everyyear, and the classified ads are where you get the best deal for your oldcar.andP;  It's no coincidence that the vitality of the U.S.andP;  automakers isn'twhat it was in 1958, either.andM;NEEDED: A GOOD IDEALandM;There has never been an adequate used-computer arrangement instituted bycomputer stores.andP;  While there are a couple of large vendors of used machinesand a few stores that specialize in used computers, this is hardly thesolution needed to permanently move the PC-XT out of American businesses.andM;What is needed is a good deal (&quot;Did I hear someone say deal?&quot;).andP;  The mostdemand XT owners, many of whom are reading this column, would welcome turningin their trusty XT for a speedy 386 machine that can process information atleast ten times faster if it could be done with an investment of $1,000 paidover 3 years.andM;The key to success is to make sure the machines don't depreciate, but alwaysmaintain a fixed resale value based on the prices of new machines and theircost per usable mips.andP;  This way a computer becomes a commodity item with aknown exchange-rate value and not a piece of electronic junk.andP;  Dealers couldrecycle the machines in their used-computer lot.andM;Assigning a value based on cost per usable mips would mean that I/O-chokedtechnologies running around fast processors would be evaluated based on whatthey can do, not on some theoretically achievable speed.andP;  When this happens,then there will be a viable used-computer market, and XTs can be movedsmoothly out of American business.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
