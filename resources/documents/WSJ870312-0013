Harcourt Brace declined to comment.    Separately, New World Pictures Ltd., which owns 200,000 shares, or just under 4.5%, of Harper andamp; Row's stock, said it has requested a copy of Harper's shareholder list. Harry Evans Sloan, a New World co-chairman, wouldn't say what the company intends to do with the list. But in a letter to Harper's board, New World protested a shareholder-rights plan that Harper's holders are scheduled to vote on April 2 and offered to discuss &quot;a business combination proposal involving our two companies.&quot;    Mr. Sloan declined to comment on whether his Los Angeles-based movie and television company is still interested in bidding for Harper in light of Harcourt Brace's proposal. Mr. Cross, who called the new bid &quot;pretty wild,&quot; said he would study the matter, but wasn't inclined to try to outbid Harcourt Brace.    Mr. Cross, who controls 261,650, or close to 6%, of Harper andamp; Row's 4.4 million common shares outstanding, added that he would be surprised if Harcourt Brace &quot;could handle&quot; such a transaction because of high debt from recent acquisitions. In October, Harcourt Brace, an Orlando, Fla.-based publisher, paid $500 million to acquire CBS Inc.'s book-publishing operations, which consisted of educational publishers Holt Reinhart andamp; Winston, W.B. Saunders, and Dryden Press.    New World, however, has a war chest of more than $200 million in cash and cash equivalents, much of it from a debt offering last year. The company yesterday said it recently sold its 456,900-share stake in Taft Broadcasting Co., a step that appeared to free about $69 million in cash.    Like Mr. Cross, who has said he won't pursue the takeover if Harper andamp; Row rejects his bid, Harcourt Brace doesn't appear to be a hostile suitor. In its proposal, the company said that &quot;should the directors and shareholders of Harper andamp; Row decide it's against their interest to accept any offer, then HBJ will, of course, step aside,&quot; according to Harper. Harcourt Brace's and Mr. Cross's plans include the assumption of about $40 million of debt.    In New York, a Harper andamp; Row spokeswoman said the company's directors will consider the proposal, but reiterated an earlier statement that the company wishes to remain independent.    Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts speculated that a bidding war may ensue for Harper andamp; Row if other companies make proposals.    The announcement of Harcourt Brace's bid came after the market closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harper andamp; Row closed at $33.50 a share, down 75 cents.    J. Kendrick Noble, a publishing analyst at Paine Webber Group Inc., said Harcourt Brace and Harper andamp; Row would be &quot;a good fit.&quot; With the purchase of CBS publishing operations, Harcourt Brace became one of the largest publishers of elementary and high-school textbooks and the largest publisher of medical textbooks. Harper is also a large educational publisher and publishes medical and professional books. He noted that Harcourt Brace isn't a force in trade publishing, while Harper is.    An analyst who asked not to be identified said he valued Harper andamp; Row at between $40 and $45 a share, &quot;so the Harcourt bid could be preemptive.&quot; He added that Harcourt Brace may be able to justify the price because &quot;there is no part of (Harper's) business that doesn't fit into Harcourt.&quot;    But some analysts speculated that other bidders may emerge for Harper andamp; Row because it is one of the few attractive publicly held publishers remaining after last year's spate of merger activity in the industry. Harper employees control about 29% of the company's stock; directors and managers own an additional 17%. But the analysts noted that despite the company's desire to stay independent, it would be difficult to refuse an offer at the right price.    Among potential suitors are various European companies that are interested in entering book publishing in the U.S. because it is the only media business that doesn't present major entry barriers to foreign companies, the analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
