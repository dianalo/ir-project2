Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the House JudiciaryCommittee, squelched a GOP attempt to substitute an amendment forhis proposed statute outlawing desecration of the flag, includingburning, with penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine.   Brooks ruled that the amendment, backed by President Bush andoffered by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was non-germane to thecommittee's business today.   ``Keeping the constitutional amendment from a vote is going tocome back soon enough to haunt those who made the decision,''because a statute would never work, Sensenbrenner argued.   Committee debate brought out strong views on both sides of theissue.   Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., said he thought the Supreme Courtwas correct when it protected flag burning as a means of protest.   It was only an issue in Congress, he said, because the flag wasused as a weapon by Bush in the 1988 campaign and Democrats were``running scared whenever the question of the flag has beenraised.''   But Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., said the American people weredemanding action and the Democrats claiming they were protectingthe First Amendment by blocking a constitutional amendment remindedhim of repression in Poland and Hungary.   ``Those who scream First Amendment the loudest are the one'sshutting off debate,'' he said.   The Democratic-controlled committee's meeting today was cutshort because the House Republican leadership has refused, unless aconstitutional amendment is also voted upon, to waive a rulebarring committees from voting on bills when any legislation isbeing considered on the House floor.   The panel was to resume its work Thursday.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and the other topDemocrats contend the statute can pass constitutional musterbecause it doesn't take into account whether the flag burning orother mutilation was part of a protest or similar act.   Brooks' bill also makes an exception so that veterans groups andothers can continue to dispose of old, worn-out flags, for whichburning is the traditional method.   The bill also provides for the law to get expedited review bythe Supreme Court, which started the political fire last month whenit threw out, by a 5-4 vote, a Texas statute against flag burning.The court said the statute banned political expression, which isprotected by the Bill of Rights.   The ruling was widely condemned by lawmakers in both parties,but President Bush made it an intense political fight when he saidhe would support only the constitutional amendment approach toovercoming it.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that Bushremained ``adamant'' in his belief that the flag should beconstitutionally protected.   The Justice Department concluded that no simple statute couldaccomplish the goals of those who want to protect the flag,Fitzwater said.   The House Judiciary subcommittee on constitutional rights heardtestimony from the Justice Department and from scholars, includingHarvard University constitutional expert Laurence Tribe, who saidthe court might OK a regular statute.   The Democratic leadership has tentatively scheduled a vote onthe statute next week in the hope support for a constitutionalamendment will cool during Congress' August recess.   The Senate has scheduled votes on both the amendment and astatute in October.</TEXT></DOC>
