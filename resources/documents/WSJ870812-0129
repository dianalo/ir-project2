Hyundai, Korea's largest auto maker, had resumed production Monday after a four-day halt. Yesterday, however, the company said strikes at its 20 parts factories caused it to again suspend output. The earlier production stoppage also stemmed from strikes at parts facilities.    Company officials in Korea didn't say how long Hyundai's assembly lines in Ulsan would stay idle, but they said they were concerned about a significant decrease in exports. Hyundai had planned to ship about 250,000 cars to the U.S. this year.    In the U.S., a company spokesman said that Hyundai Motor America has a 26-day supply of cars, with an undisclosed number of additional vehicles aboard transport ships headed for the U.S. Manufacturers in the U.S. consider a supply of 60 to 65 days to be normal, but the spokesman said the company's current American supply is &quot;average for us.&quot;    &quot;For the present, it's still business as usual for us,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't speculate on when it's going to start getting tough.&quot;    In addition to Hyundai, labor disputes have crippled factories run by other major Korean manufacturers, including Daewoo Corp., the Samsung group and the Lucky-Goldstar Group. Negotiations continued, but operations remained crippled, at major shipyards and factories.    Reports said that Daewoo Motor Co., an equally owned joint venture between General Motors Corp. of the U.S. and Daewoo, was being affected by the labor actions. But at GM's Pontiac division, a spokeswoman said the company had been told that a strike at Daewoo Motor, which makes the Pontiac LeMans, had been settled. GM expects &quot;very little loss of production&quot; because of the strike, she said.    Officials of the Korean government said that nearly 240 strikes had been called in the past five weeks, mostly in manufacturing and transportation industries, and that about 130 of them were still under way. Official figures weren't available on the number of strikers, but newspaper accounts put the total at between 60,000 and 65,000.    The wave of strikes has followed the government's announcement of political reforms at the end of June. Workers are seeking higher wages, improved working conditions and the right to form unions independent of management or government control.    Government authorities have said that the labor disputes should be solved by workers and management without outside interference. Yesterday, however, Labor Minister Lee Hun Ki warned that &quot;government authorities will be forced to take legal action if rampant labor strikes spread beyond control and threaten the nation's daily life and economy.&quot; He urged labor and management to negotiate settlements.    The labor minister said the unrest was seriously affecting South Korea's export-led economy. He said the strikes had caused the nation to lose about $130 million in production and $54 million in export earnings.    Mr. Lee expressed concern about strikes involving violence or unreasonable demands, and warned that radicals engaging in &quot;agitation with impure intention&quot; would be rooted out. He didn't define what kinds of demands he considered unreasonable, but he appeared to be referring to large pay increases.    Mr. Lee's warning followed clashes Monday between police and striking coal miners in eastern Korea. Thirty people were injured when police fired tear gas to disperse militant miners who hurled rocks and took control of rail lines.    Much of the labor unrest has occurred in southern industrial centers in Pusan, Ulsan and Changwon, but it has spread to smaller working places, service industries and to the coal mining field of Kwangwondo in the northeast. Newspapers reported disputes were under way at 18 coal mines involving about 25,000 miners. </TEXT></DOC>
