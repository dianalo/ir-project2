The helicity subamplitudes are computed using recursionin the number of gluons. A new algebraic identity is presented whichallows for a complete reduction of the subamplitudes to a minimal basis,leading to a considerable increase in the efficiency of the algorithm.The results are compared with various approximate expressions which haverecently been proposed, under several sets of realistic experimentalconditions. The computational complexity of the algorithm is discussedin detail.</TEXT></DOC>
