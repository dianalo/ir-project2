For23 years the murder remains unsolved. Then Joe Corey, husbandof the victim's granddaughter, takes a leave of absence fromhis New York corporate-law work to see if he can locate themissing pieces to this old and fatal puzzle. So begins &quot;TheMandeville Talent&quot; (John Macrae/Henry Holt, 278 pages,$19.95), the latest top-of-the-line crime thriller fromGeorge V. Higgins.   Mr. Higgins, a former assistant U.S. attorney for theDistrict of Massachusetts and onetime television critic forthis paper, writes with great authority about the committingand investigating of criminal acts. The realistic dialogue in&quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle,&quot; his 1972 debut novel, was arevelation to readers and writers of the genre, and in this23rd Higgins book the complex story unfolds almost completelythrough conversation.</LP><TEXT>   Neophyte sleuth Corey acquires some valuable allies as heprobes the Mandeville affair. Chief among them is BaldoIanucci, a former Defense Department intelligence agent. Thetwo men link Mandeville's co-investors in a million-dollarland purchase to a shell corporation that fronts fororganized crime. When Mandeville's share of the deal lookedto become more lucrative than his silent partners', it seems,they brought in out-of-town &quot;talent&quot; to balance the banker'sbooks for good.   The layers of guilt hidden beneath Shropshire's NormanRockwell-like exterior are gradually peeled away throughmonologue, dialogue and interrogation. Only one jarringlyfalse note is sounded, when a Spanish priest with aneccentric approach to English is unbelievably made to recountverbatim a New England lawyer's idiomatic and slang-riddenspeech. But such a fleeting lapse seems a small thing toforgive in this otherwise splendidly crafted tale.   Greed, power and violence are universals, fromMassachusetts to Moscow. Leif Davidsen's greatly appealing&quot;The Russian Singer&quot; (Random House, 277 pages, $19) is set inthe Soviet capital during the gloomy height of the Chernenkoera. Glasnost and perestroika are all but undreamt of.Corruption and inequity are ubiquitous. Jack Andersen, Danishdiplomat, becomes obsessed with finding the truth behind thesordid deaths of a secretary working in his embassy and herRussian girlfriend. His poking into the connections betweenMoscow lowlifes and Kremlin higher-ups leads to a romanticinvolvement with the Russian girl's sister and eventually toAndersen's expulsion from the country. After Gorbachev'sascendance, the Dane is asked to return to Russia and assistthe new regime in reopening the case.   Mr. Davidsen -- a Danish journalist and author of anotherthriller, &quot;The Sardine Connection&quot; -- has written a taut andlively novel. From embassy parties sizzling with in-houserivalries to emotional drinking bouts withno-longer-so-angry, no-longer-so-young poets, the authorrenders scenes of Soviet life with a bracing freshness.Andersen, an amateur boxer with a quick temper and anintemperate tongue, sets the pace for a quirky cast ofcharacters who rarely say or do the expected. JorgenSchiott's translation reads as smoothly as if it were theoriginal text. With its swift action and believable lovestory, this book is a real find.   New Orleans can seem as exotic as Moscow to those not bornand bred there. It's the setting of Julie Smith's &quot;TheAxeman's Jazz&quot; (St. Martin's Press, 341 pages, $19.95),second in a series featuring New Orleans police DetectiveSkip Langdon, a six-foot-tall woman with the currentlyrequisite detective-fiction mixture of spunk, personalinsecurity and unresolved romantic yearnings. The titlederives from a famous N'Awlins bogeyman of the past, amurderer who galvanized the city by promising to spare thosefrom whose houses jazz music blared on the nights he chose toroam. This mystery's villain revives the ghoulish rhythmictradition.   Despite that premise, Langdon's new outing is much lighteron Louisiana customs and culture than its predecessor. It'ssatirical focus is on the proliferating recovery movement,with its dozens of &quot;12-step groups&quot; filled with&quot;co-dependents&quot; addicted to everything from food to work toshopping. It seems the new Axeman's victims are being pickedfrom an &quot;inner-child group&quot; that, like the other 12-stepgatherings, doesn't require those attending to give theirfull names. &quot;Murder Anonymous,&quot; quips one of the cops.   The book's new age-speak is amusing, and some of the painthat throbs beneath the recovery-babble is ably shown. Butthe much-anticipated morbid jazzfest is a letdown, and few ofthe novel's large assortment of suspects and potentialvictims are very credible or engaging.   Detective Langdon appears to better advantage in one ofthe 21 stories gathered in &quot;A Woman's Eye&quot; (Delacorte Press,448 pages, $19), an anthology of all-new short tales, editedby Sara Paretsky. All the protagonists here are female, andamong them are most of the best-known women police andprivate investigators on the current scene: Ms. Smith'sLangdon, Ms. Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski, Sue Grafton's KinseyMillhone and Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone.</TEXT></DOC>
