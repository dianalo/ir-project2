Several foreign manufacturers, however, already include driver-side air bags as standard equipment on some cars.    The six Chrysler models that will get air bags are the 1988 Fifth Avenue, Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, Chrysler LeBaron convertible and coupe and the Dodge Daytona.    Ford Motor Co. currently offers driver-side air bags as an option on its Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz compact cars, and General Motors Corp. offers them as an option on the Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale. Both charge more than $800 for the device. A Chrysler spokeswoman wouldn't say whether Chrysler will raise the price of the cars on which air bags will be standard, although most observers regard a price increase as inevitable.    Mercedes-Benz of North America initiated standard driver-side air bags on all its U.S. models in 1986. Last year four other foreign auto makers made the equipment standard on some of their models. Those companies include the Acura division of Honda Motor Co., BMW of North America Inc., Volvo of America Corp. and Porsche Cars of North America.    In Porsche's case, air bags on both the driver's and passenger's side are standard on the 944 Turbo and 944S models. </TEXT></DOC>
