Gorbachev's arms reduction proposals, as the Western allianceseeks common ground in the changing landscape of East-Westrelations.   The two-day summit that begins Monday marks the 40th anniversaryof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but a dispute over thealliance's own short-range nuclear missiles threatened to underminethe unity celebrations.   Still, NATO officials said they would not let the missiledispute overshadow what they described as the real task of thesummit leaders _ planning their strategy to deal with the enormouschanges under way in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   ``NATO is at once ready to assure a common defense and to reducearms,'' Bush said as he set the tone for his meeting with alliedleaders. Possible U.S. initiatives included proposals to reduceU.S. troop strength in Europe and drop a ban on high-technologyexports to the Soviet Union.   The New York Times reported in Monday's editions that Bush, in aconfidential letter to other western leaders late last week, hadproposed that NATO offer a cut of about 30,000 American troops inEurope as part of a plan to reduce non-nuclear forces.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday eveningthat some of the allies had been briefed on the substance of theU.S. proposals, but he declined to provide details of theinitiatives.   Bush said on his arrival in Belgium, home of NATO headquarters,that he looked forward to the time the Soviet Union will bewelcomed as a ``constructive partner,'' but he also stressed theneed to maintain NATO defenses and the security of Europe.   The United States remained at loggerheads with West Germany overBonn's demand for early superpower talks to reduce short-rangenuclear weapons. The United States says those weapons will remainessential until the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventionalforces is reduced.   But West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher insistedSunday at a German political rally that ``Disarmament cannotexclude any kind of weapons.''   A spokesman for Margaret Thatcher, who arrived here Sundaynight, said the British prime minister ``cannot contemplate''negotiations to reduce short-range nuclear missiles ``unless anduntil conventional force reductions have been agreed and they'rebeing tangibly implemented.''   The British spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidit was possible no deal would be reached at the summit. ``We aren'tin the business of a bad agreement. We are in the business ofretaining flexible defense,'' he said.   Bush flew to Brussels from Italy, where he closed out a two-dayvisit with an emotional Memorial Day weekend tribute to Americansslain in a 1944 assault on fascist Italy.   At the U.S. military cemetery in Nettuno, which holds theremains of nearly 8,000 soldiers, Bush said their deathsdemonstrated ``why we need to keep a strong military deterrent toprevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy.''   Bush highlighted the story of war hero Sylvester Antolak, ayoung soldier from Ohio who won the Medal of Honor forsingle-handedly capturing an enemy machine-gun nest despite beinghit three times by gunfire. Antolak, who is buried in Nettuno, knew``the cost of maintaining freedom,'' Bush said.   Earlier, some two dozen right-wing demonstrators had delayed thepresidential motorcade for about three minutes, hurling a blizzardof flyers questioning whether the U.S. troops in World War II wereliberators or invaders. A handful were arrested.   Bush was greeted at Brussels National Airport by Belgian PrimeMinister Wilfried Martens.   ``We want to see an end to the division of Europe,'' thepresident said, but he also called on the East to adopt ``Westernvalues'' as a way of bringing the two sides closer together.   Martens called for ``seizing the opportunities to improve theconditions of peace while taking care not to jeopardize security.''   White House officials, declining to be identified, said whateveractions Bush might take on the 305,000 to 324,000 troops in WesternEurope would be framed as a NATO proposal in East-West armsreduction talks in Vienna.   ``Whatever he proposes will be done in the context of submittingsuggestions for alliance consideration,'' Secretary of State JamesBaker said Sunday.   The New York Times report said Bush's proposal to NATO leaderswould mean a 10 percent overall U.S. troop cut, including a 20percent cut in U.S. Army and Air Force combat troops in Europe. Thepresident's plan would require the Soviet Union to cut more of itstroops in Eastern Europe than Moscow has proposed thus far, theTimes said.   The paper said Bush also proposed that the West accept theSoviet contention that aircraft in Europe be part of a conventionalarms pact. Bush suggested an acceleration of efforts to negotiate atreaty and expressed hope an agreement would be reached within ayear and implemented by 1992 or 1993, the Times said.   Baker and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also acknowledged WestGermany's interest in reducing the NATO short-range nuclear weaponson its soil, but they said the United States is in no hurry topursue talks with the Soviets on that issue.   In an NBC-TV interview from Rome, Baker said ``the president hasalready acknowledged at least the principle of negotiations,although he feels very, very strongly that before you can talkabout that or get into that, you need to see a conventional forcesagreement'' with the Warsaw Pact.   But Genscher on Sunday threatened that his Free Democratic Partywould withdraw from West Germany's coalition government ifChancellor Helmut Kohl adopted the American stance. Facing suchpolitical pressure at home, Kohl warned on Saturday against delayin addressing the missile issue.   Fitzwater said Sunday that ``The situation is unchanged. Wecontinue to discuss it.''   White House officials, meanwhile, indicated Bush is now ready tohave NATO negotiate directly with the Warsaw Pact on troop levels.   The comprehensive Western arms reduction proposal tabled inVienna in March called for indirect manpower cuts throughwithdrawal of equipment and consequently the troops needed tooperate it.   Gorbachev this month offered a 1.26 million cutback in WarsawPact troops as part of an overall reduction in forces to reachequal ceilings of 1.35 million for the two alliances.   An American initiative to reduce troops might blunt disarmamenttendencies within NATO and allow the Western leaders to paper overthe missile issue with an ambiguous communique at the windup of theBrussels summit on Tuesday.   Pressure has been building on Bush since Gorbachev announcedlate last year that the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and50,000 troops from Central and Eastern Europe and cut Soviet forcesby 500,000 overall.</TEXT></DOC>
