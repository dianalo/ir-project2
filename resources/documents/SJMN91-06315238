Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers,whose country holds the rotating EC presidency, said &quot;an important step&quot; hadbeen taken in Saturday's discussions to reach agreement on disputes in theagricultural and services sectors but &quot;a gap remains.&quot; However, a communiqueissued at the end of the talks did not specify what progress had been made.;  Lubbers and Bush said the negotiators remain committed to reaching anagreement by the end of the year. Disputes over farm subsidies nearly endedthe 5-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round last year,and the parties have been in intense negotiations since.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  SUSAN BENNETT, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  The Hague, Netherlands  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  615  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 10, 199100315238,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
