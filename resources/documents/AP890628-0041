A 1789 proposal to bar sitting members of Congress from raisingtheir pay is the only constitutional amendment pending before thestates.   Six other proposed amendments have passed Congress by thenecessary two-thirds vote but failed to win ratification in therequired three-fourths of the states _ currently 38 of the 50 states.   Bush called Tuesday for a constitutional amendment that would setaside last week's Supreme Court decision and forbid desecration ofthe American flag.   Most proposed amendments expire if not ratified after sevenyears. In the case of the one pending amendment, no expiration datewas set by Congress.   The pay amendment, authored by James Madison, states: ``No lawvarying the compensation for the services of the senators andrepresentatives shall take effect, until an election ofrepresentatives shall have intervened.''   Twenty-three states have approved the amendment, which consumeradvocate Ralph Nader and some state lawmakers have attempted torevive in recent years during controversies over congressional pay.   The last proposal to expire without enough states was a plan togive the District of Columbia full voting rights in Congress. Itfell short by 22 states in 1985. The capital currently has anon-voting delegate in the House.   Before that, the Equal Rights Amendment fell three states shortin 1982.   Four other amendments which were sent to the states but failed tobe ratified included a formula proposed in 1789 for determining thenumber of House members; a ban suggested by the 11th Congress oncitizenship for anyone receiving a title of nobility or honor from``any emperor, king, prince or foreign power;'' a bar proposed in1861 on Congress interfering with the domestic institutions of anystate, including slavery, but slavery was abolished in 1865 by the13th Amendment; and a 1924 proposal involving child laborregulations.   There also is a move afoot for a constitutional convention, whichmust be called after a petition from two-thirds of the states.Thirty-two of the required 34 states have applied to Congress. Thismethod has not yet been used to amend the Constitution.   The Congressional Research Service said there were at least 9,994proposed constitutional amendments introduced in Congress from 1789through 1984, but the number is considered low because of poorrecord-keeping in the early years.   The Library of Congress says 155 such proposals have beenintroduced since the 101st Congress began in January.</TEXT></DOC>
