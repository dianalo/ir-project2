Pete Wilson's proposed budgetwas revealed and discussed Thursday and Friday.;    There was Bill Honig,state superintendent of schools, looking at a possible $1.4 billion cut inschool funding for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and calmly -- well, whatpasses for calmly with the hyperkinetic Honig -- saying he would have to gotalk to the governor about it. No metaphors about stabbing school kids in thegut.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INSIDE THE WILSON BUDGET  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary.;  Phil Yost is chief editorial writer of the Mercury News.;  Seerelated Editorial page 6C of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     There was Senate Pro Tem David Roberti, a liberal Democratic defender ofthe poor and downtrodden, looking at a rollback in welfare, which he said hehoped to avoid, yet talking about Wilson's &quot;fair attempt to balance thebudget&quot; in bleak times.;    What happened? For eight years the usualDemocratic comment to George Deukmejian's budget was &quot;dead on arrival.&quot;;   First, in writing a budget in difficult financial circumstances, Wilsonclearly made an attempt to parcel out the pain -- enhancing some socialprograms while cutting others and raising $1.7 billion in new tax revenues.Politically, he indicated that he's willing to be more collegial thanDeukmejian was in dealing with the Legislature and other officeholders.;   Second, everybody in Sacramento knows we're in hard times. The differencebetween a workload budget -- maintaining the same state programs, adjusted forpopulation increases and inflation -- and the revenues the state expects is $7billion. The total general fund is $43.3 billion.;    Even the mostdogmatically liberal officeholders understand the political reality that theentire gap can't be closed with tax increases. For instance, to raise $7billion from taxes alone would require increasing income taxes for everyone byat least 30 percent.;    The budget gap is huge this year because therecession will  cut tax revenues. Already sales tax revenues have dropped off.As companies are forced to lay off workers, income tax receipts will drop andwelfare costs will rise.;    But there's an ongoing structural gap as well.The number of children in school, families on welfare, sick people on Medi-Caland, especially, inmates in jail, is increasing faster than the statepopulation as a whole. In general, caseload increases mean the cost ofproviding state services is growing faster than the state's economy.;    TheCommission on State Finance predicts revenue growth of 8.7 percent annually, acombination of inflation and real economic growth, during the 1990s. If theschool population grows at 4.3 percent, as expected for the next four years,and inflation runs at 5 percent, the real cost of running the schools willoutpace the growth in revenue.;    A tax increase closes the gap in the shortrun. But unless economic growth keeps pace with caseload and inflationincreases, new taxes will have to be added yearly or programs have to be cutback.;    What Wilson did;  In outline, here's what Wilson did. He deniedcost-of-living raises across the board. He decreased, adjusted for inflation,funding for schools slightly, and funding for welfare grants by about 9percent. He proposed to raise taxes and fees on license plates, alcohol, candyand newspapers.;    The $7 billion of the gap is closed with $1.7 billion innew taxes and $4.2 billion in cuts. He hopes to save $800 million on Medi-Calby moving to prepaid health plans -- like Kaiser -- rather than afee-for-service plan.;    This effectively attacks the structural problemseveral ways. It ends the presumption that recipients of state services willget annual cost-of-living increases. In the long term, Wilson's emphasis onsocial programs for children should cut the increases in students needingspecial education, young people who turn to crime, families that go onwelfare. He's got the right idea.;    Of the numerous elements of the Wilsonbudget that will be subject to Legislative debate, three are especiallysignificant: universities, corrections and taxes.;    At the universities,financial necessity has prompted Wilson to propose something justifiedphilosophically as well. He would raise student fees (essentially tuition) by20 percent. The savings are not huge, about $70 million for the University ofCalifornia and California State University systems.;    At a proposed cost of$2,145 at UC or $1,076 at CSU for the 1991-92 school year, a universityeducation still is a great bargain. The governor's budget estimates averagefees at public universities comparable to UC at $2,883.;    General-fundsupport for an undergraduate student at either UC or CSU is $7,450. Whenenough money is set aside so needy students can still attend, the fee increaseamounts to a reduction of a subsidy to the middle class and up. The averagefamily income of UC students is $54,000 and of CSU students, $46,000.;    It'snot unreasonable to ask students or their parents to pay a greater share of aneducation that substantially increases their earning power.;    Prisons; Corrections is the biggest disappointment in Wilson's budget. Having thoughtinnovatively about social programs, Wilson on crime is the same oldlock-'em-up.;    Wilson would increase the corrections budget 16 percent. Why?The prison population is going up 13 percent.;    In this part of the budget,the evidence of a structural imbalance is overwhelming. The state populationis expected to increase 2 percent a year in the '90s; revenues are expected torise 8.7 percent a year. And the prison population is estimated to go up 6percent a year (after increases in double digits through 1992), while thecosts go up 10 percent a year.;    Unless someone invents a cheaper way ofholding prisoners (perhaps suspended animation so they don't have to be fed orguarded), corrections is going to eat an increasingly large share of thebudget.;    In the face of this, Wilson has been talking up an idea --eliminating sentence reductions for good behavior -- that could throw thesystem into chaos. About 80 percent of inmates reduce their sentences as muchas half through work programs. If their sentences double, the prisonpopulation will go through the roof.;    A recent report on inmate managementsuggested a variety of community-based treatment and supervision programs fornon-violent offenders. Wilson wouldn't be able to make a big dent in theprison budget in one year. But at least he could be starting some of the kindsof programs that he's doing for small children.;    Revenues;  Wilson alsodidn't do enough to raise new revenues. While the structural problem with thebudget can't be handled with tax increases alone, part of it can, because partis temporary.;    In education, welfare, Medi-Cal and even prisons, sharplyhigher caseload increases are expected to be a three- to five-year phenomenon.After that caseloads will grow more in step with state population and theeconomy. A tax increase could tide the state over that time without cuttingeducation and welfare as sharply as Wilson has.;    Increases aimed athigher-income taxpayers can be justified on the grounds that during the 1980s,they enjoyed a relatively lighter tax load because incomes at the top end ofthe scale rose faster than the tax burden on high incomes.;    The SenateRevenue and Taxation Committee has prepared a long list of possible taxoptions.;    I suggest the following by way of illustrating that a modest risein taxes -- beyond what Wilson has proposed -- would offset some pain towelfare recipients and educators with a little pain for taxpayers.;    (check)Disallow interest deductions for second homes. Raises $55 million.;    (check)Conform to federal limitations on itemized deductions for high-incometaxpayers. Raises $145 million.;    (check) Conform to federal tax treatmentof Social Security and unemployment. Raises $327 million.;    (check) Renewthe quarter-cent additional sales tax that ran last year to pay for earthquakedamage. The tax expired Dec. 31. Raises $767 million.;    The total is $1.3billion.;    By imposing these taxes, Wilson could have avoided rolling backwelfare grants ($225 million) and with the $1.1 billion left for education, hecould keep it pretty close to even with the cost of living and increases inenrollment.;    Especially in the case of education, a tax increase would haveenabled Wilson to do more of what he's trying to do in the rest of the budget:invest in people now so they'll be more productive later.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Phil Yost column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,396  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013198,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
