Shirley McVay Wiseman, former general deputy assistant secretaryfor housing, said Pierce called her and instructed her to approvemillions of dollars for a Durham, N.C., project sought by Pierce'sformer law partner.   Wiseman said Pierce's exact words to her were, `I want theproject funded'.''   ``I can't fund it but I will send it upstairs to you,'' Wisemansaid she told Pierce.   As a result of HUD's approval, the developers received more than$11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $2.3 million urban developmentaction grant and more than $3 million in tax credits, said Rep. TomLantos, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee onunemployment and housing.   Janet Hale, who succeeded Wiseman at HUD, testified that on herfirst day on the job, she was directed by Deborah Gore Dean,Pierce's executive assistant, to ``forward'' the funding documentson the North Carolina project.   However, Hale said that Pierce's signature was already on thedocuments approving funding for the project.   Pierce testified before the House panel in May that he had nodirect role in HUD funding decisions. Since then, however, therehave been reports that Pierce intervened on behalf of associates,including the one-time law partner, former Durham Mayor CharlesMarkham, who was seeking HUD financing for the North Carolinaproject.   Both former HUD aides testified under oath, as had Pierce earlier.   Pierce, who has returned to the practice of law and businesspursuits in Manhattan, has been recalled by the panel for furtherquestioning. But no date has been set for his appearance.   Sources told The Associated Press on Thursday that Dean, who forthree years was Pierce's top aide, sought immunity from prosecutionin exchange for her testimony implicating Pierce. However,congressional sources said Lantos hoped to gain that informationindependent of Ms. Dean.   ``The granting of immunity is not under active consideration bythe subcommittee,'' Lantos said today.   Ms. Dean last month refused to answer questions from thesubcommittee, invoking her Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination. One of the sources said that if grantedimmunity, Ms. Dean was prepared to testify that Pierce orderedfunding for numerous projects under the Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation program.   The program was suspended briefly earlier this year and itsselection guidelines rewritten after HUD auditors criticized projectselections. Auditors said influential Republicans had successfullylobbied HUD officials in favor of projects involving their clients.   Ms. Wiseman has said she quit her job as HUD's assistantsecretary for housing because Pierce ordered her to fund the NorthCarolina project over the objections of other agency officials.   Pierce replaced Ms. Wiseman with Ms. Hale, now a specialist inthe Office of Management and Budget, who in 1985 approved fundingfor the project.   Wiseman also testified that she was lobbied by Carla Hills,President Ford's HUD secretary, on behalf of DRG Funding Corp., thelargest private lender that underwrote mortgages in a $5 billion HUDcoinsurance program. DRG at the time was on probation. Ms. Wisemansaid Ms. Hills went over her head to Pierce after failing toconvince her that the restrictions should be lifted.   ``It was later brought to my attention that Hills had... takenthe case to Secretary Pierce. I was informed by staff that there wasa meeting,'' and DRG's probation was lifted, she said.   DRG now is the subject of an FBI criminal investigation, and HUDofficials believe the government may lose as much as $500 millionbecause of DRG's handling of government-backed loans.   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said earlier this week that abuses atthe agency during the Reagan administration _ the period of Pierce'stenure _ cost HUD in the ``ballpark'' of $2 billion.   A Kemp aide said Thursday that more than half of that amount,$1.1 billion, was believed to have been lost by just one program, aco-insurance venture administered by HUD's Federal HousingAdministration.   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported today that HUD hiredattorney Peter E. Novick to head a program that had losses threeyears earlier estimated at $240,000. The paper said the lossesoccurred because Novick made false statements working as asettlement attorney in real estate transactions from 1982 to 1984.   Novick, 47, pleaded guilty May 25 in U.S. District Court to onecount of making a false statement and has been ordered to report inmid-August to a halfway house to serve a one-year sentence, thepaper said.   Novick had worked for HUD as an attorney before going intoprivate practice. He was rehired by HUD in February 1987 aftertalking with Thomas Demery, then assistant secretary for housing.   In other developments Thursday:   _The Senate Banking Committee voted to launch its own HUDinvestigation.   _That committee also approved the nomination of Francis A.Keating II as HUD's general counsel, a post that will have a keyrole in agency dealings with investigations by law enforcementagencies.   _An aide to the Lantos subcommittee said U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, who was HUD secretary during the Fordadministration, will appear before the panel next week to facequestions about her lobbying of HUD officials after she left theagency.   _A Houston-area lawyer acknowledged he has been barred from doingbusiness with the federal government because he was slow in turningover some $1.5 million from sales of HUD property. Attorney Larry E.Thomas said he had not kept any money, and a HUD official confirmedthat almost all the money had been recovered.</TEXT></DOC>
