Maj. Gary Hovatter, U.S. public affairs officer at Palmerola airbase, said the troops were training at four sites throughout thiscountry of 4.5 million people. Palmerola is about 40 milesnorthwest of the capital.   ``We're just training down to the wire. It's nothing exotic,''Hovatter said in a telephone interview.   He said about 6,000 American soldiers currently are stationed inHonduras, including the 3,200 from the 82nd Airborne Division atFort Bragg., N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,Calif., who will begin the trip home Monday.   President Reagan rushed the soldiers to Honduras on March 17 and18 after Sandinista troops from neighboring Nicaragua reportedlyentered Honduras in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels.   The U.S. government billed the current military presence inHonduras an emergency training exercise meant both as a show ofsupport for Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo and a warning tothe leftist Sandinistas against further actions in the region.   But the Nicaraguan government denied Sandinista troops wereinside Honduras and charged that the Americans came to Honduras inorder to leave behind weapons and equipment that the Contras coulduse.   Hovatter said Saturday that three auditors from the GeneralAccounting Office were staying at Palmerola, the headquarters forU.S. military operations in Honduras, to ensure that the all theequipment brought in by the Americans got back to the United States.   The equipment includes two Sheridan tanks, a dozen 105mmhowitzers, more than 100 machine guns, several thousand M-16automatic rifles, mortars and ammunition.   ``There will be a full accounting of all ammunition,'' Hovattersaid.   Tensions rose in the region after the American troops arrived,however, and the Honduran air force said it twice bombed the Bocayborder region inside Honduras where Sandinista activity was spotted.   Hovatter said Saturday the exercises here, nicknamed ``GoldenPheasant,'' have been productive because they gave Americansoldiers the opportunity to practice in the field.</TEXT></DOC>
