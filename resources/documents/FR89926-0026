As the Commissionnoted in the Supplementary Information to this rule-- <ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the Commission is committed to do everything it can to streamlineits licensing process and at the same time conduct a thorough safety reviewof the Department of Energy's application to construct a high-level wasterepository. The negotiators to this rulemaking have made a number of improvementsto our existing procedures. However, more improvements may be necessaryif the Commission is to meet the tight licensing deadline established bythe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended. By publishing this rule,the Commission is not ruling out further changes to the rules containedin the negotiated rulemaking. 54 FR 14925, 14930.</ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission has evaluated the need for any further modificationsto the procedures for the HLW proceeding. This evaluation has focused onthe need to modify or supplement, through rulemaking or other proceduralmechanisms, the provisions contained in the new Subpart J. The objectiveof the proposed revisions is to enable the Commission to conduct the HLWlicensing proceeding in the most efficient manner possible and to facilitatecompliance with Section 114(d) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended,which requires the Commission to make a decision on the issuance of theconstruction authorization for the repository within three years afterthe submission of the DOE license application, while still providing fora thorough technical review of the license application and equitable participationin the HLW proceeding by affected parties. For the HLW proceeding, theproposed rule would establish a new standard for the admission of initialcontentions, would define ``late contentions'' as any contention proposedafter the initial contentions were submitted, would require parties topresent direct testimony on contentions, would establish a compulsory hearingschedule, and would eliminate <T3>sua sponte </T3>review by the Commission's adjudicatory boards. In conducting its evaluation of the need for further changes to the HLWlicensing process, it has come to the Commission's attention that thereis some question as to whether the Commission is required to use a threemember Licensing Board to resolve disputes during the pre-license applicationphase of the HLW proceeding. It was never the Commission's intention thatit have less flexibility for resolving disputes during the pre-licenseapplication phase of the HLW proceeding than exists for other NRC licensingproceedings. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing clarifications tothe regulations to provide the Commission with the same options for resolutionof disputes during the pre-license application phase of the HLW proceedingas exist in other NRC licensing actions. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rule</ITAG>Standards for initial contentions (andSection; 2.1014)On August 11, 1989, the Commission promulgated a final rule amending theprovisions of general applicability in Subpart G of the Commission's Rulesof Practice (``final rule on regulatory reform''). 54 FR 33168. The finalregulatory reform rule addresses standards for the admission of contentions(andSection; 2714), the elimination of unnecessary discovery against theparties (andSection; 2.740), the discretionary use of cross-examination plans(andSection; 2.743), motions for summary disposition (andSection; 2.749) andlimitations on intervenors filings of proposed findings (andSection; 2.754)and appeals (andSection; 2.762). Section 2.1000 of Subpart J cross-referencesthose sections of general applicability in Subpart G that will continueto apply to the HLW licensing proceeding. As such, all but one of the provisionsin the final regulatory reform rule - andSection; 2.714, which requires contentionsto show that ``a genuine dispute exists on a material issue of law or fact''- will automatically apply to the HLW proceeding. However, Subpart J containsa new provision on contentions, andSection; 2.1014, and andSection; 2.714 wouldtherefore not apply to the HLW proceeding. Consequently, the proposed revisionsto Subpart J would amend andSection; 2.1014 to incorporate a similar standardfor contentions to that contained in andSection; 2.714 of the final regulatoryreform rule. The proposed amendments to 10 CFR 2.1014 would raise the threshold forthe admission of contentions to require the proponent of the contentionto supply information showing the existence of a genuine dispute with theapplicant on a material issue of law or fact. The contention must be supportedby a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion, togetherwith specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware, whichwill be relied on to establish the facts or expert opinion. This requirementdoes not call upon the intervenor to make its case at this stage of theproceeding, but rather to indicate what facts or expert opinion, be itone fact or many, of which it is aware at this point in time which providethe basis for its contention. Absent a showing that there is a genuinedispute on a material issue of fact or law, the contention will not beadmitted. Under the proposed amendments, admission of a contention mayalso be refused if it is determined that the contention, even if proven,would be of no consequence in the proceeding because it would not entitlethe petitioner to relief. Finally, the proposed amendments would providethat a contention raising only an issue of law will not be admitted forresolution in an evidentiary hearing but shall be decided on the basisof briefs and/or oral argument. In addition to providing a statement of facts and sources, the proposedrule will also require intervenors to submit with their list of contentionssufficient information (which may include the known significant facts describedabove) to show that a genuine dispute exists between the petitioner andthe applicant on a material issue of fact or law. This will require theintervenor to read the pertinent portions of the license application, statethe applicant's position and the petitioner's opposing view. Where theintervenor believes the application and supporting material do not addressa relevant matter, it will be sufficient for the intervenor to explainwhy the application is deficient. Late-filed contentions (andSection; 2.1014)The proposed rule would amend andSection; 2.1014 to require that any contentionsproposed after the initial contentions have been filed must satisfy thehigher standard for admission that is currently set forth in andSection;2.1014(a)(4) of Subpart J. In addition to the standards in andSection; 2.1014(a)(1),a proponent of a late-filed contention would need to demonstrate that thecontention addresses a significant new safety or environmental issue, orthat the contention raises a new material issue related to the performanceevaluation required by 10 CFR 60.112 and 60.113. The proposed revisionwould retain the standard for late filed contentions that is in andSection;2.1014(a)(4) of the existing rule, but would apply that standard to anycontention filed after the initial contentions are submitted. The existingrule only applies the higher standard to contentions submitted more than40 days after the issuance of the NRC Staff Safety Evaluation Report (SER).The Hearing Licensing Board is to interpret the ``good cause'' criterionin andSection; 2.1014(a)(1)(i) strictly; the mere issuance of the SER wouldnot constitute ``good cause'' for late filing under andSection; 2.1014(a)(1)(i).In evaluating whether the contention raises ``significant'' or ``material''issues, the Board could consider such factors, among others, as whethera materially different result in the proceeding might be likely if thecontention were to be admitted, or whether a modification in facility designor construction that substantially enhances the protection of public healthand safety would result if the contention were to be admitted. The laterin the proceeding that a contention is raised, the greater the burden inshowing its significance or materiality. The extensive interaction betweenNRC, DOE, and affected parties such as the State of Nevada in the pre-licenseapplication phase, as well as the early availability of relevant documentsthrough access to the LSS before initial contentions must be filed, shouldsubstantially reduce the need for late-filed contentions. By identifyingthe issues in controversy, to the extent practicable, at the outset ofthe hearing, the proposed revision will contribute to an efficient hearingprocess. Participation in the LSS (andSection; 2.1014)The Negotiating Committee had originally proposed that a factor to be consideredunder andSection; 2.1014(c) governing admission to the high level waste proceedingwould be the petitioner's participation as a potential party under andSection;2.1008(c) of Subpart J. The Commission deleted this provision in the finalversion of the Subpart J rulemaking because, the Commission did not believethat pre-license application access would have any meaningful effect ona Licensing Board's determination on intervention petitions. Thus, participationin the LSS would not be given weight as a factor in favor of granting anintervention petition. In deleting that provision, however, the beneficial effect of encouragingparticipation in the LSS was also deleted. Because participation in theLSS is an important component of the procedural mechanisms adopted by theCommission to meet its statutorily dictated deadline for considerationof the application for construction of the high-level waste repository,the Commission does wish to encourage participation in the LSS. While itstill does not believe that participation in the LSS should be a favorablefactor affecting the Licensing Board's decision on granting an interventionpetition, the Commission does believe a failure to participate in the LSSshould weigh against the granting of an intervention petition. Accordingly,the Commission has decided to add as an additional factor under 10 CFR2.1014(c), to be considered by the Licensing Board in determining whethera petitioner has met the requirements for participation as a party to thehigh-level waste proceeding, the failure of a petitioner to participatein the LSS. Direct testimony on contentions (andSection; 2.1024)The proposed rule would add a new andSection; 2.1024 to Subpart J that wouldrequire a party that sponsors a contention to present direct testimonyon the contention. Past NRC practice has been to allow a proponent of acontention to prove its case solely by cross-examination of the licenseapplicant's or the NRC staff's witnesses. The proposed amendment wouldrequire a party sponsoring a contention to put forth direct expert testimonyin support of the contention. However, a party could subpoena a witnessof the applicant or the NRC staff to satisfy this requirement, in effect,calling a ``hostile'' witness. Under proposed andSection; 2.720(a), a partyseeking to subpoena a hostile witness, other than from the NRC staff, wouldbe required to demonstrate the general relevance of the testimony to thecontention. However, under proposed andSection; 2.720(h)(2)(v), the presidingofficer is directed to not issue a subpoena requiring the testimony ofnamed NRC personnel unless a showing is made that the particular namedNRC employee has direct personal knowledge relevant to the contention,and that the testimony sought is not reasonably obtainable from anothersource. This will reduce the potential for the direct case requirementto divert critical NRC staff resources from other functions. The cost ofobtaining the necessary testimony from another source will not be a relevantfactor in making the determination required under proposed andSection; 2.720(h)(2)(v).The proposed requirement for a direct case would also apply to repliesto motions for summary disposition as well as to contentions. Summary dispositionmotions that are supported by evidentiary material in the form of affidavitswould also necessitate a reply to the summary disposition motion that issupported by affidavits. Although the proposed amendment deviates from current NRC practice, theCommission believes that the expedited hearing schedule required by theNWPA, the extensive pre-license application consultation process, and theearly availability of relevant licensing material through the LSS, justifiesa requirement of a direct case from those who seek to participate in theproceeding. The sanctions for failing to present a direct case on a contentionat the hearing will be dismissal of the contention. Failure to respondin kind to a motion for summary disposition of a contention would alsoresult in the dismissal of the contention. In terms of the ultimate burdenof proof, the license applicant would still have to satisfy the NRC thatthe issue involved has been acceptably resolved, as is the case with alluncontested issues. Compulsory hearing schedule (andSection; 2.1026)In order to facilitate compliance with the NWPA schedule, the Commissionset forth a model hearing schedule in the Supplementary Information ofthe LSS rule. 54 FR 14924, 14939. Several of the milestones in the modelschedule are already required by virtue of the provisions in Subpart J.The proposed rule would make the entire schedule mandatory, while stillproviding some flexibility to the Board to address mitigating circumstances.For the filings required of the parties, the Board may grant extensionsfor any individual milestone of up to 15 days. Any approval by the Boardof extensions in excess of 15 days would be referred to the Commission.If the Commission did not act to disapprove the extension within 10 days,the Board's extension would be effective. Barring exceptional and unforeseencircumstances, a party who seeks an extension beyond 15 days must filethe request for the extension no later than 5 days in advance of the scheduleddate for the milestone. For Board issuances, the Board would have a grace period of thirty daysto comply with the milestone. If the Board anticipates that such a milestonewill be exceeded by more than thirty days, the Board is required to notifythe Commission of the delay at least ten days in advance of the scheduleddate for the milestone, and to provide a justification for the delay. Thiswill allow the Commission to track the cumulative effect of individualdelays on its ability to meet the NWPA schedule. Sua sponte (andSection; 2.1027)The proposed rule specifically prohibits the Hearing Licensing Board orthe Appeal Board from raising issues that have not been placed in controversyby the parties to the proceeding. The Commission does not believe that<T3>sua sponte </T3>authority is necessary in a proceeding, such as theHLW proceeding, where a hearing is required on the decision to authorizeconstruction of the repository, and where the parties will include entitiesthat should be well-prepared and have had substantial involvement in theHLW licensing process, and therefore, there is little likelihood that asignificant issue will be overlooked. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conforming Amendments </ITAG>The proposed rule also contains several conforming amendments. Section2.1000 has been revised to delete andSection;andSection; 2.749 and 2.785(b)(2).The proposed rule adds a new andSection; 2.1025 on summary disposition forthe HLW proceeding. Therefore, the summary disposition provision, in thegeneral applicability provisions of Subpart G, andSection; 2.749, no longerneeds to be cross-referenced in andSection; 2.1000. Section 2.785(b)(2) inSubpart G allows the Appeal Board to consider serious matters that havenot been raised by the parties. This would conflict with proposed andSection;2.1027 which prohibits <T3>sua sponte </T3>review and therefore has been deleted from andSection;2.1000. Finally, proposed andSection; 2.4(p) clarifies that for purposesof andSection; 2.1018, ``NRC Personnel'' includes NRC consultants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Clarification to LSS Regulations </ITAG>The Commission is also proposing a change to 10 CFR 2.1003(h) to clarifythat the periodic evaluations of, and written report on, DOE's compliancewith the LSS requirements, required by andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(i) and (ii),will be circulated to the potential parties for comment. While the currentregulations provide at andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(iii) that a party may commenton the report required under andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(ii), the regulationsare silent concerning comments on the evaluations required by andSection;2.1003(h)(2)(i). In order to assure early identification of any disputesconcerning the LSS administrator's findings on DOE's compliance with theLSS requirements, the Commission is amending andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(iii)to specify that both the evaluations required under andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(i)and the written report required under andSection; 2.1003(h)(2)(ii) will becirculated to the potential parties in the high level waste proceedingfor comment and that objections to the Administrator's findings on DOE'scompliance must be filed within 30 days of the Administrator's report orbe waived. In addition, the Commission is proposing clarifications to 10 CFR 2.1010governing resolution of disputes during the pre-license application phaseof the HLW proceeding. Current NRC regulations, at 10 CFR 2.1010, providethat a ``Pre-License Application Licensing Board'' will decide certaindisputes which arise during the pre-license application phase associatedwith licensing of the high-level waste repository. The regulations at 10CFR 2.1000 also provide that the provisions of 10 CFR 2.704 will applyto the high-level waste repository licensing proceeding. Although 10 CFR2.704 provides that the Commission may, in a Notice of Hearing, providefor one or more members of the Commission, or an atomic safety and licensingboard, or a named officer who has been delegated final authority in thematter, to preside over NRC hearings, the Notice of Hearing associatedwith the high level waste repository construction application will post-datedesignation of a Presiding Officer to rule on issues during the pre-licenseapplication phase of the High Level Waste Repository proceeding. In addition,the language in 10 CFR 2.1010 has raised some question as to whether theCommission is limited to use of a three member licensing board during thepre-license application phase of the high level waste repository proceeding.The Commission, in adopting 10 CFR 2.1010, did not intend to limit theCommission's options to use of a three member licensing board during thepre-license application phase of the high-level waste repository licensingproceeding. While the Commission may, in fact, decide to use a three memberlicensing board to resolve pre-license application disputes, the Commissiondid not intend that its options for resolution of these issues would bemore limited then for other NRC proceedings. Accordingly, the Commissionis adopting amendments to the language of 10 CFR Part 2, which clarifiesthat the Commission retains the full range of options, similar to the optionsdelineated in 10 CFR 2.704 for other NRC proceedings, for resolution ofdisputes during the pre-license application stage of the high-level wastelicensing proceeding. In addition, the jurisdiction of a Presiding Officer designated under 10CFR 2.704 is normally contained in the Notice of Hearing for the proceedingover which the officer will preside. Because no Notice of Hearing willhave issued in the pre-license application stage of the high-level wasteproceedings, the Commission is also adopting an amendment that clarifiesthat the Commission will, in designating a Presiding Officer under 10 CFR2.1010 for the pre-application phase of the HLW proceeding, specify thejurisdiction of the Presiding Officer. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Hearing </ITAG>In addition to the procedures set forth for the HLW proceeding in SubpartJ, the Commission intends to also address several issues related to themanagement of the hearing in the Commission's Notice of Hearing for theHLW proceeding. Under the current schedule, the DOE license applicationwill not be submitted until early 1995. However, the Commission is nowevaluating, and seeks comment on, the following issues that it plans toinclude in the Notice of Hearing-- (1) The Commission itself will designate the members of the Hearing LicensingBoard. This Board will have plenary authority and management responsibilityfor the HLW hearing, including the authority to discipline parties, torule on procedural motions on issues before it, and to rule on party statusand contentions. The Hearing Licensing Board may establish such other subsidiaryboards as are necessary to hear and decide discrete issues identified bythe Hearing Licensing Board for separate disposition. (2) The Commission is contemplating the selection of the technical membersof the Hearing Licensing Board from a wide pool of external and internalcandidates, including members of the Commission's Licensing Board Panel.This will ensure the greatest potential for identifying candidates withthe requisite expertise. The Commission anticipates a three member HearingLicensing Board consisting of a lawyer-chairman who is experienced withNRC procedures, and two technical members, one with engineering expertiseand one with geoscience expertise, and both with a background in performanceassessment. (3) Encourage the Board to set time limits on cross-examination if necessaryto meet the hearing schedule. (4) Direct the Board to institute the ``lead intervenor'' concept for theproceeding. (5) Direct the Board to limit the scope of re-direct and re-cross examinationto the issues raised on cross-examination and re-direct examination, respectively.(6) Encourage the Board and parties to reach agreement on the order ofhearing issues, so that related issues can be addressed at the same time,and to extent practicable, in a logical sequence. (7) Instruct the NRC staff to refrain from becoming involved in proceduraldisputes between other parties in which the staff does not have an interest,unless the Hearing Licensing Board specifically requests the staff's viewson the matter. (8) The Commission will clearly define the precise scope of the hearing,outline the appropriate general issue areas to be considered in the proceedingand define the boundries of the Hearing Licensing Board's jurisdictionin the Notice of Hearing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion </ITAG>The NRC has determined that this proposed regulation is the type of actiondescribed in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore neitheran environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has beenprepared for this proposed regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This proposed rule contains no information collection requirements andtherefore is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1989 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposedregulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternativesconsidered by the Commision. The draft analysis is available for inspectionin the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington,DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from B. W. Jones, U.S.Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Telephone: 301-492-1637.The Commission requests public comment on the draft regulatory analysis.Comments on the draft analysis may be submitted to the NRC as indicatedunder the <T3>Addresses </T3>heading. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification </ITAG>This proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities. The amendments modify the Commission's rulesof practice and procedures. The license applicant for the HLW repositorywill be the Department of Energy, which would not fall within the definitionof small businesses found in section 34 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C.632, in the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issuedby the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121, or in the NRC'ssize standards published December 9, 1985 (50 FR 50241). Although a fewof the intervenors in the HLW proceeding are likely to fall within thepertinent Small Business Act definition, the impact on intervenors or potentialintervenors will not be significant. While intervenors or potential intervenorswill have to meet a higher threshold to gain admission to NRC proceedingsand will be required to present a direct case on contentions, and therebyincur some additional costs in preparing for, and participating in, theproceeding, these costs will be minimized by the early availability ofinformation through the LSS and the pre-license application consultationprocess. Thus, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.605(b), the NRC hereby certifies that this proposed rule will not havea significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>This proposed rule does not modify or add to systems, structures, components,or design of a production or utilization facility; the design approvalor manufacturing license for a production or utilization facility; or theprocedures or organization required to design, construct, or operate aproduction or utilization facility. Accordingly, no backfit analysis pursuantto 10 CFR 50.109(c) is required for this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 2</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Antitrust, Byproduct material, Classifiedinformation, Environmental protection, Nuclear materials, Nuclear powerplants and reactors, Penalty, Sex discrimination, Source material, Specialnuclear material, Waste treatment and disposal.
