Fixed-coupon bonds were off 1/8 to 1/2 point, with most of the drop in longer maturities.    In Eurodollar syndications, Household Finance Corp., a unit of Household International Inc., offered $100 million of 8 1/2%, three-year Eurobonds to mixed reviews. An official at one European bank noted that investors currently aren't favoring finance company paper but added that on other grounds, Household Finance should have been attractive. The official said the spread to Treasurys of 79 basis points didn't seem wide enough to overcome the easing of markets yesterday afternoon. A basis point is 1/100 of a percent.    Dealers wondered about the timing of the launch by lead manager Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd. just after the U.S. trade figure was released and as the Eurodollar bond markets were weakening. It was decided to launch the bonds then because UBS didn't anticipate a sharp correction on the U.S. trade figure, a UBS official said. He added the &quot;name is well enough known that placement shouldn't be much of a problem.&quot;    Meanwhile,a strong election showing by Australia's ruling Labor Party over the weekend has led to a flood of Australian dollar Eurobonds, continuing yesterday with 425 million Australian dollars ($301 million) of new paper.    The new issues aren't all likely to find buyers immediately because the markets are becoming jammed with such bonds and aren't fundamentally very deep anyway, dealers said. But in light of that sector's strong performance, Australian Eurodollar bonds may now be set to outgrow their role as a niche instrument, some said.    Among yesterday's issues, reviews were mixed for ITT Corp.'s reappearance in the Euromarkets after a two-year absence. Some dealers contended ITT's ITT Financial Corp. unit's 75 million Australian dollars of 14%, three-year bonds were priced on the tight side. Lead manager Goldman Sachs International Inc. said there was institutional interest in the bonds and that the borrower's name would ensure demand.    (Revised WSJ July 17, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
