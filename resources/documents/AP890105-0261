Mead Data General Inc. has sued Toyota claiming that the Lexusname diluted the business of its Lexis legal information retrievalservice.   A federal district judge issued a restraining order last weekforbidding Toyota from using the Lexus name, but an appeals courtdelayed implementation of that order earlier this week.   The ruling Thursday by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in NewYork extended the reprieve on a limited basis at least until Jan.30, when the appellate court will hear arguments on the merits ofthe case by lawyers from both sides.   The extension came just as Toyota was unveiling its Lexus line atthe North American Auto Show, which runs through Jan. 15 in Detroit.Lexus also has a display running the same time at the Los AngelesAuto Show.   Company officials had nervously wondered whether they would haveto cover up the names of the cars at their swank exhibits.   ``We could have changed it (the display) in four hours,'' saidPerkins.   Appellate Judge Emilia Kearse said Toyota may continue to use theLexus name at the auto shows and at other expositions, but cannotadvertise Lexus nationally until the matter is settled.   Lawyers from both sides were happy with Thursday's decision.   ``Essentially, they have given each side part of what itwanted,'' said Mead attorney Charles J. Farouki.   Arthur D. Gray, who represents Toyota, said: ``We're pleased withthe result.''   ``We're one step further,'' added Bob McCurry, executive vicepresident of Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. ``I think it shows that wehave a case there.''   Toyota and the Lexus division have dropped millions of dollarsinto the Lexus name since it was agreed upon in August 1987.   The Lexus booth at the Detroit auto show features two four-doorsedans, the LS400 and ES250, which vary in cost from $20,000 to$40,000 and are aimed at buyers ready for luxury cars but unwillingto pay more for European imports.   The legal dispute with Mead has attracted heavy press attentionto the Lexus exhibit, where reporters got a preview before theexposition opens to the public Saturday.   ``Our most immediate job is to earn name recognition for Lexus,''said Perkins. ``Unfortunately, we're doing it the hard way.''</TEXT></DOC>
