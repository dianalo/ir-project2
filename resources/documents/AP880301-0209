FRANCO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Louisiana Assemblies of God church leadershave rejected a request by national church officials that theyreconsider their sanction against television evangelist JimmySwaggart, a church official confirmed Tuesday.   The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said the 19-memberstate presbytery decided to send back its original censure barringSwaggart from preaching for three months. That decision came Mondayduring a nine-hour meeting at Louisiana district headquarters inAlexandria, La.   ``The ball's in their court,'' the source said, indicating thatit would now be up to national Assemblies of God officials todecide whether to abide by the state panel's recommendation.   There was no immediate comment from the national headquarters inSpringfield, Mo.   The Rev. Raymond Hudson, general treasurer, said he had nocomment and other officials were not at home Tuesday night. Callsto the home of spokeswoman Juleen Turnage were met by busy signals.   The Louisiana Presbytery's original sanction was a two-yearrehabilitation program that also included counseling for Swaggart,who heads a ministry which reportedly has an annual income of $150million.   Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21, telling thecongregation at his Baton Rouge worship center in a tearfulconfession that he had sinned against his family and God. Swaggartreportedly paid a prostitute to pose naked for him and then triedto make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it.   The latest development in the scandal surfaced in a story byKATC-TV in Lafayette, La. The station said it had also learned thatthe national presbytery had recommended barring Swaggart from thepulpit and television for a year, with an additional year ofregulation of his ministry afterwards.   A Louisiana Assemblies of God official contacted by TheAssociated Press Tuesday night confirmed that the state panel hadsent its previous sanction back to the national council. Theofficial talked only under conditions he not be identified.   When asked if Louisiana officials had sent back their originalcensure to the church's national leaders, the source said, ``Itwould be correct to say that.''   Cecil Janway, the Assemblies of God district superintendent forLouisiana, said when the state panel met Monday that there would beno announcement of its decision.   ``Decisions made by the Louisiana district presbytery today willbe returned to the executive presbytery. There will be no furtherannouncement or comment from the Louisiana district council,''Janway said.   There was no indication whether Swaggart attended that meeting,which lasted from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Rev. Jim Rentz, who issubstituting for Swaggart at the Family Worship Center in BatonRouge, attended the meeting.   Forrest Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana districtcouncil, acknowledged Monday that national Assemblies of Godrepresentatives were at the Alexandria meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
