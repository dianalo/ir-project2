In fact, natural rights principles provided the moralphilosophic underpinning for the U.S. Declaration ofIndependence; for the French Declaration of the Rights ofMan; and for the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsadopted by the United Nations as the framework for aninternational system of human rights.</LP><TEXT>   The chief exponent of modern natural rights theory(divorced from religion) was England's great philosopher,John Locke. Locke developed his philosophy within theframework of the humanism and political enlightenment of the17th century. Locke posited a natural state of man in whichliberty prevailed, since no one was subjected to the will orauthority of another. However, to obtain the benefits thatorganized society can provide, the members of a natural stateentered into a compact by which they mutually agreed to forma community and set up a body politic. But they retainedtheir natural rights of life, liberty and property.Government was obliged to protect these natural rights and,if it did not, it would forfeit its validity.   It was this concept that lay behind Jefferson's statementin the Declaration of Independence that certain rights were&quot;unalienable.&quot; To Jefferson, the natural rights were life,liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Indeed, the denial ofthose rights, as the preamble to the Declaration ofIndependence states, was the rationale for the AmericanRevolution.   The main criticism of natural rights doctrine is that itleaves vague what is considered part of the law of natureand, therefore, inalienable.   Of course, establishing natural rights norms asconstitutional principles solves a good part of this problem.Much of the Bill of Rights -- such as First Amendment rights,due-process privileges and immunities, and the right ofprivacy -- can be seen as a delineation of natural rights.   During the 19th and early 20th centuries, natural rightsfell into disfavor with legal philosophers. Jeremy Bentham,for example, called natural rights &quot;simple nonsense&quot; andnatural, inprescriptable rights &quot;nonsense upon stilts.&quot;(Jefferson undoubtedly would have been offended.)   Natural rights theory was largely replaced with legalpositivism. Positivism holds that legal authority stemssolely from what the state has laid down as law. Positivistscondemned natural law thinkers because they had blurred thevital distinction between what the law is and what it oughtto be. However, the flaw in positivist philosophy is that thelaw is no better than the source of its authority.   In the aftermath of World War II, a revival of naturalrights theory emerged. It was due in part to the revulsionagainst Nazism, which revealed the horrors that could emanatefrom a positivist system in which the individual wascompletely subjugated to the state. It was not surprisingthat what emerged was a renewed search for immutableprinciples that would protect individual dignity and worth.   Some modern philosophers, such as John Rawls and AlanGewirth, build on Kant's intuition that the central focus ofmorality is personhood -- namely, rights flow from theautonomy of the individual in choosing his or her ends.   Most modern natural rights theorists are agreed that aminimum or core of any just system of rights must includerecognition of the values of individual freedom. Still, thereis far from agreement on the scope or emphasis given to thesevalues. This problem continues to plague natural rightstheorists.   The renaissance of natural rights theory has had aparticularly beneficial influence on modern internationalhuman rights norms. That influence is found in the 1948 U.N.Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which begins: &quot;Whereasrecognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal andinalienable rights of all members of the human family is thefoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world . . .&quot;   Natural rights philosophy has also figured in somelandmark cases advancing individual rights. When ThurgoodMarshall was the advocate in Brown v. Board of Education, hespoke of the concept of equality of human beings as restingupon &quot;the basic proposition&quot; that all people &quot;are endowedwith certain natural rights.&quot;   In a similar vein, Judge Thomas has written of theimportance of interpreting the Constitution in light of the&quot;founders' notions of natural rights.&quot; Judge Thomas has alsoadvocated a &quot;true jurisprudence of original intent,&quot; whichreflects the &quot;moral aspirations of equality&quot; that Jeffersonset forth in the Declaration of Independence. Reachingnormative moral/legal conclusions from concepts of equalityis, as Prof. Ronald Dworkin's writings illustrate, a liberalposition. If that is the thrust of Judge Thomas's natural lawleanings, my liberal soul is not disturbed.   To be sure, both liberal and conservative Supreme Courtjustices assert a textual justification for opinions onconstitutional issues. Still, one's philosophy invariablyinfluences how one interprets the text. Conservative justicesgenerally take a positivist view that emphasizes thecentrality given to Congress as the lawmaking authority.Liberal justices, such as Justices Brennan, Blackmun andMarshall, emphasize individual, unprescriptable rights, thusfavoring by implication, if not explicitly, a natural rightsperspective. To the extent that liberal reasoning interpretsthe Constitution to support what ought to be just law in ademocratic society, natural law concepts play a role.   It is ironic that Judge Thomas, who would be expected tovote with the conservative majority, should be criticized fora natural rights philosophy that might well impel him toexpansive readings in favor of individual rights. JudgeThomas's espousal of natural rights may turn out to givecomfort to those of us who believe that protection ofindividual rights and liberties is the core of ourconstitutional democracy.   ---   Mr. Shestack, a Philadelphia attorney, was formerly U.S.ambassador to the U.N.
