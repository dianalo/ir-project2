(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman fighting for control of sevenfrozen embryos in an unprecedented divorce case on Thursday wasawarded temporary custody by a judge who ruled that life begins atconception and the woman should be allowed to carry them to term.   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young, ruling in favor ofMary Sue Davis over her estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis,declared that their embryos were children not property.   ``I'm thrilled. It's definitely what I wanted,'' Mrs. Davis tolda news conference in Titusville, Fla., where she now lives.   Davis said he would appeal in the state court system, andpotentially beyond. ``They are going to force me to become a fatheragainst my wishes,'' he said.   Mrs. Davis said she would not try to get pregnant immediately.``I'm waiting to see about the appeal then hopefully after that tryto have a child,'' she said. ``I could (try) at any time, but I haveto recover from all of this and then consider starting the program.''   She added that the earliest she would try to get pregnant wasJanuary.   ``As far as we are aware, this is the first judicial decisionwhich has declared an embryo a human being,'' said Charles Clifford,Davis' attorney, adding that he would ask the court to prevent Mrs.Davis from implanting the embryos until appeals are settled.   Clifford said the ruling could conflict with the Supreme Court'slandmark Roe vs. Wade decision allowing women to have abortions.Janet Mayfield, the attorney who will handle Davis' appeal, said thedecision might also conflict with state laws on property interestsand anatomical gifts.   The case grew out of the decade-old technology of ``test-tubebabies,'' or in-vitro fertilization. The Davises became embroiled inthe dispute after they were unable to have children and turned to invitro fertilization.   The couple produced nine embryos in December under the guidanceof Dr. I. Ray King at a Knoxville clinic. Two were implanted in Mrs.Davis but failed to develop. The others were put in cold storage.But then, Davis sued for divorce in February.   During testimony in August, Davis, 31, said he would feel ``rapedof my reproductive rights'' if Mrs. Davis were allowed to implantthe embryos without his consent.   Mrs. Davis, 29, argued the embryos represent her best chance ofbecoming a mother. She contended that Davis was seeking a right notnormally given to a man _ whether a child should be born after hehas fertilized the egg of his mate.   After declaring the four- to eight-cell embryos to be children,Young in effect treated the case like a custody dispute, in whichthe overriding concern is the best interest of the child.   ``From fertilization, the cells of a human embryo aredifferentiated, unique and specialized to the highest degree ofdistinction,'' the judge said. Thus, he said, ``human life begins atconception.''   Young said Mrs. Davis could have temporary custody so that shecould have the eggs implanted in her womb in hopes of becomingpregnant. Child support, visitation and final custody will bedecided if a birth results, he wrote.   ``It was the toughest decision of my life as a judge,'' Youngsaid in an interview. ``On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 10. I haveagonized over it.''   Young's ruling relied on a 1988 federal appeals court decisionfrom Florida affirming the reliability of DNA profiling indetermining a person's individuality _ ``that the life codes foreach special, unique individual are resident at conception andanimate the new person very soon after fertilization occurs.''   The judge said the Roe vs. Wade decision was ``in directly theopposite direction'' from Davis vs. Davis. ``Everything the courtsaid in Roe vs. Wade dealt with the constitutionality of abortionstatutes,'' he said. ``That issue was not before this court.''   But Clifford said the Roe decision ``contains some explicitlanguage that says that a fetus, which of course is much furtheralong than an embryo, is not a human being for the purposes of theUnited States Constitution.''   Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life Council ofConnecticut, called the court's decision ``a victory for unbornchildren.''   Ellen Clayton, an associate professor of law and pediatrics atVanderbilt University, called the ruling ``a disaster ... that couldhave implications on in vitro research and abortion.''   In the in vitro process, eggs are extracted surgically from awoman's body and mixed with sperm in a laboratory dish. Those thatare fertilized can be implanted in the womb. Testimony indicated thesuccess rate for the procedure averages about one in five.   The Davises' divorce is not yet final. In his ruling Thursday,Young instructed Mrs. Davis to file final papers that would completethe proceeding. The couple did not contest other issues such asdivision of household property.</TEXT></DOC>
