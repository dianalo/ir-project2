<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0039 </DOCNO><TEXT>The identification of wrench faults from subsurface structural data isproblematic and requires detection of combination of profile and mapcharacteristics, namely: (1) basement offset, (2) steeply dipping dislocationat depth, (3) upward-spreading splays (negative and positive flower structures),(4) changes in direction of fault dip and upthrown side, (5) changesof separation sense and merged splays with different separations, (6)a narrow, long, straight, throughgoing, solitary zone of deformationand/or master fault, and (7) coeval, en echelon flanking structures.The criteria that are present must be supported with evidence that refutesalternative styles. Other profile geometries-narrow contractional horstsor narrow extensional grabens, step faults or splay structures, variousanticlines with crestal faults, two-sided orogenes, narrow rift basins,minor disruptions in reflection continuity, and various structures withcomplex or equivocal relationships-have been misinterpreted as flowerstructures. Misidentifications also arise because map patterns have multipleinfluences, the pattern has been altered by rock anisotropy, the structuralcomponents are not coeval, the criteria have been applied at incorrectscales, the zone of deformation has been incorrectly delineated, theevidential structure is incongruent with the proposed tectonics, theprimary structure is not recognized, and the observed structures areincongruent with the implied deformational intensity or proposed stresssystem.</TEXT></DOC>
