ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four years ago, while space shuttles weremaking regular satellite-delivery runs into orbit, the Air Forcebegan agitating for a return to rocket launches in case somethingwent wrong with the shuttle fleet.   Something did go horribly wrong _ Challenger _ and the spaceprogram is back where it started 30 years ago, using expendablerockets.   Edward C. Aldridge, then undersecretary of the Air Force,sounded the warning before Congress in 1984.   ``We simply cannot afford to be in a situation, whatever theview on its likelihood, that could result in our being denied allaccess to space,'' he said. ``The Department of Defense must not betotally dependent on the shuttle ... We feel that having our totallaunch capability placed on the shuttle is an unacceptable risk.''   Aldridge's testimony was the capstone of a furious fight with asister agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,which contended that the Air Force was trying to undermine thecivilian shuttle program by pushing for a return to large,expensive, ``expendable launch vehicles'' to put militarysatellites in orbit. The space agency all along had counted on themilitary to be its paying customer on at least one-third of allflights.   Aldridge, now secretary of the Air Force, got his ELVs. Hiswarnings proved to be prophetic when the Challenger blew up on Jan.28, 1986. Because of his efforts, an assembly line was starting toput an improved version of the Air Force's workhorse Titan rockettogether.   Like all disasters, the space program's came in threes. On April18, a Titan 34-D exploded five seconds after launch with a secretmilitary payload and on May 3, a Delta, carrying a $57 millionweather satellite, had to be destroyed when it veered out ofcontrol. The United States was left with no capacity to launchheavy payloads.   With the shuttle fleet grounded for nearly three years andexpensive satellites sitting in warehouses with no place to go, theexpendable launch vehicle industry had a slow rebirth.   President Reagan ordered NASA out of the commercial launchingbusiness; the Air Force began spending billions to restore an ELVfleet that was all but depleted; owners of satellites with no wayto orbit began booking rides with the European consortiumArianespace; and both China and the Soviet Union began solicitinglaunch business.   As of July 23, Arianespace has contracts to launch 40 satellitesfor $2.3 billion, including 7 from the United States and more thana dozen from other countries and international organizations thatpreviously used American launch vehicles.   For years, the United States had encouraged development of aprivate launch industry, but not a single customer had been signed.In the new climate, the big three rocket builders suddenly got intothe buiness of selling satellite deliveries as a package deals:rocket and launch for one price, discounts available for two ormore.   ``There has been a resurgence in this industry,'' said FredBettinger of General Dynamics, which makes Atlas-Centaur and Atlas2 rockets. General Dynamics has 18 Atlas-Centaurs on its assemblyline _ although only four are sold for $50 million to $60 millioneach; it has orders for 11 Atlas 2s through 1997 for $856 million.   McDonnell Douglas has a major share of the Air Force ELVbuildup. The Air Force has ordered 14 Delta 2s for $493.8 millionand has options for six more for a total $690 million. In addition,said McDonnell Douglas' Tom Williams, the company began to marketthe Deltas commercially and has seven orders through 1991.   ``Two years ago we were going out of business in the area ofELVs,'' Williams said. ``That was before the Reagan administrationrevived the ELV business.   ``During that vacuum when Challenger crashed and before our ELVbusiness was resurrected, Arianespace cleaned up, securing manycontracts. The balance has been redressed especially this year. Welanded four contracts in 1987 and three this year.''   Among McDonnell Douglas commercial customers are BritishSatellite Broadcast Limited, the governments of India andIndonesia, NATO and two for Inmarsat.   Martin Marietta has contracts for $5.5 billion worth of itsTitan rockets and their launches _ three different launch vehiclesfor Air Force and commercial customers.   ``What really gave us the impetus to start our commercial Titanbusiness was the presidential decision to take commercial payloadsoff the shuttle,'' said Judy Herb, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman inDenver. ``We announced within days of that that we had formed theCommercial Titan Co.''   The firm is marketing a version of the Titan 3 _ an Air Forcestandby since the 1960s _ as the Commercial Titan, and has soldfour at $100 million to $125 million each for launches throughearly 1990. It also has an agreement with General Electric tolaunch up to 15 satellites over a number of years, all on theCommercial Titan.   The Titan 2, a refurbished Intercontinental Ballistics Missilewas launched for the first time this month (September) and thereare 13 more on order for $638.7 million.   The newest and biggest of the line, the Titan 4, is on a pad atthe Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida for launch inOctober. It has the greatest lift capacity of any American rocket,being able to put a 10,000-pound satellite into orbit 22,300 milesabove Earth.   Twenty-two more Titan 4s are on order, bringing the price tag to$4.2 billion through 1993 and the Air Force has just announced itsintention to buy 20 more of the behemoths.   An irony is that NASA, which fought ELVs so long as a threat tothe manned space flight program, now is standing in line to buythem from the Air Force.   In 1984, Aldridge called an ELV capacity ``a modest hedgeagainst unanticipated and unforeseen shuttle problems which mightcause fleet groundings or outages.'' In 1988 NASA tends to agree.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sun, Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
