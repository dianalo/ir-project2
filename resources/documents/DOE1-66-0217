Aspart of the control room upgrade, an improved alarm monitoring and displaysystem is being installed. This system consists of completely redundanttermination boards, sequential events recorders (SERs), and fiber opticserial alarm transmission from the SERs to the window panels and to ``host''computers. Residing on these host computers will be knowledge-based alarmfiltering systems that will pass filtered and prioritized informationon to several CRT displays. Further processing will be performed at thedisplay workstations to provide the most effective display to the operators.The knowledge-based Alarm Filtering System (AFS) is an integral partof the new monitoring and display system. AFS aids operators by focusingattention on the most significant information relative to the currentplant state. 5 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
