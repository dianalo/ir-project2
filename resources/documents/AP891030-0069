It was the second such accident along the 200-milestretch of islands within a week.   The 475-foot container ship Mavro Vetranic grounded itself inthe Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands about 70 miles west of KeyWest, at about 3:45 a.m. EST, said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis, a CoastGuard spokesman in Miami.   Another ship relayed a message on the grounding to the CoastGuard at 7:50 a.m., said Petty Officer James Wentworth. A CoastGuard helicopter wasn't expected to reach the ship until latemorning.   The Coast Guard had very few details of the accident, butKaronis said there was no report of any spillage from the vessel'sfuel tanks. It wasn't immediately known what type of cargo theMavro Vetranic was carrying, if any, nor where the ship was headed,said Karonis.   ``There is no visible pollution, there's no injuries at themoment, and the ship is hard aground,'' Petty Officer AlastairWorden said after a Coast Guard helicopter flew over the16-year-old ship.   The Dry Tortugas is the site of Fort Jefferson National Monumentand is marked by a tall lighthouse as well as the massive fort,famed for its use as a Union prison during the Civil War.   A boat from the monument was headed to the ship, which ranaground on the western edge of the Tortugas, said National ParkService spokesman Pat Tolle.   ``The coral reefs will be the concern in this particularissue,'' Ms. Tolle said.   The grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship,the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland, ran aground in the Key LargoNational Marine Sanctuary, about 50 miles southeast of Miami in theUpper Florida Keys.   First mate Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, has been charged withnegligence, and ship's captain Duane Godwin, 37, has been chargedwith allowing a person without the proper license to operate thevessel.   Bishop failed two breath-alcohol tests administered about fivehours after the grounding, but he told Coast Guard officials thathe began drinking only after the accident.</TEXT></DOC>
