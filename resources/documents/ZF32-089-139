(Synergy Microsystems' SV420puts two Motorola 68040 microprocessors on a single VME cardrunning at 40 million instructions per second) (productannouncement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Andrews, Warren.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Synergy Microsystems introduces the SV420 VME card that puts two25-MHz Motorola 68040 microprocessors on a single board to provideup to 40 million instructions per second (MIPS) performance.andP;  TheSV420 can use the two 68040s in either a tightly coupled orloosely coupled mode to allow them to cooperate on a single taskor to work independently on two separate tasks.andP;  Neither processoris used for I/O functions; the SV420 provides an optional DMAcoprocessor that supports SCSI, Ethernet and four additionalsynchronous serial ports.andP;  The board supports 64-bit blocktransfers using the proposed VME64 (D64) standard; a transfer rateof 66Mbytes per second can be sustained through use of aproprietary controller with specially designed burst-modecircuitry.andP;  The two processors on the board operate as if theywere on separate boards for many applications; the primarydifferences are efficient communications between the processorsand the ability of a single card to replace two.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Synergy Microsystems Inc.
