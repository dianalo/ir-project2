No injuries were reported in the predawn blast. TV Globo, thenation's largest commercial television network, said a previouslyunknown group, Patriotic Front, claimed responsibility for theblast.   The monument was unveiled Monday during Labor Day commemorationsin Volta Redonda, a town 80 miles west of Rio. It depicted thethree victims, with a concrete spear stabbing a worker.   The monument was designed by architect Oscar Niemeyer, acommunist who designed most of the public buildings in Brasilia,the nation's capital.   Police in Volta Redonda said the monument was ``seriouslydamaged, although not completely destroyed.''   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added, ``Theexplosion was very powerful. The only reason there were no injurieswas because of the time _ 3 a.m.''   Niemeyer said in a radio interview he was ``deeply shocked'' andoffered to design another monument.   TV Globo said the blast broke windows 500 yards away andscattered fragments across a downtown plaza.   Brazil regained civilian rule, under President Jose Sarney, in1985, following a 21-year right-wing military regime. Sarney'sadministration has been marked by financial chaos, runawayinflation and almost daily strikes.   Last Nov. 9, army troops, with Sarney's authorization, invadedthe government-run National Steel Company in Volta Redonda, whichhad been occupied by strikers seeking higher pay and shorterworking hours. Three workers were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
