Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said the central bank will retain wide discretionary powers to decide who is &quot;fit and proper&quot; to control a bank under a law that took effect Oct. 1.    His remarks countered growing speculation that the banking act would weaken the Bank of England's traditional strict supervision of bank ownership. But it remains to be seen whether his assertions will calm the current takeover fever in the British banking sector.    Mr. Leigh-Pemberton told a banquet in Belfast, Northern Ireland, that he &quot;would need some persuading&quot; before letting an industrial or commercial company take over a British bank. &quot;And the closer the {target} bank to the heart of the financial system, the greater my doubts are likely to be,&quot; he said.    Using unusually blunt language for a central banker, Mr. Leigh-Pemberton insisted: &quot;Industrial and commercial companies aren't part of the banking system, nor should they enter surreptitiously and adventitiously by this means.&quot;    He added, however, that British banks sometimes can gain from foreign ownership. For this reason, the central bank didn't object when National Bank of Australia Ltd. acquired Northern Bank Ltd., a Northern Ireland bank, from Midland Bank PLC earlier this year.    But the Bank of England will set limits on which banks can be bought by foreign banks, he emphasized. The &quot;public interest&quot; requires a continued strong British presence in key domestic money, credit and capital markets, he said.    The governor also criticized companies that put banks &quot;in play&quot; by acquiring stakes to make a quick investment gain. He didn't mention Midland Bank, Britain's fourth-largest bank. But Bank of England officials didn't deny his remarks partly resulted from the recent emergence of the industrial conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC as Midland's biggest shareholder and from recurring rumors that a foreign bank might bid for Midland.    The governor's speech also apparently reflected recent maneuvers by the advertising and consultancy group Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co. to enter the banking sector.    Hanson Trust was unruffled by the governor's remarks. A spokesman said the company acquired its stake in Midland Bank purely as an investment. A Saatchi andamp; Saatchi spokesman declined to comment.    Bankers viewed the speech as an important signal to London's financial district that the central bank hasn't surrendered its discretionary powers over the British banking industry. The new banking act empowers the Bank of England to block a purchaser from acquiring more than a 15% stake in a bank if the central bank decides the buyer isn't &quot;fit and proper.&quot; Some analysts viewed the law as weakening the bank's powers by codifying the conditions under which it can thwart a takeover bid.    But the governor said the central bank shouldn't be &quot;faint-hearted&quot; in using its &quot;discretion, common sense and experience&quot; in deciding when someone aiming to control a bank is unacceptable. </TEXT></DOC>
