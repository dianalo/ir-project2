The perception, widely held, is that the economy now is betterable to handle its debt because many more loans than before carryadjustable interest rates. Flexibility is built in _ or so it issaid.   A strong argument can be made, however, that the economy insteadis much more credit-sensitive than before. The viewpoint involves,among other things, the type of credit, the amount and length of it,and the tax consequences.   The calm view of the credit future involves a view of adjustablerate loans, which are far more common on big consumer items than inyears gone by. Many see these loans as a positive factor in thecredit outlook.   That is, instead of being denied loans, as frequently occurred inthe days of fixed-interest rates, borrowers will be granted credit.This, it is argued, lessens the dangers of a credit crunch thatwould bring the economy down.   A more concerned view of the situation, however, sees adjustableloans as a threat to stability. With interest rates rising, peoplemay find themselves unable to remain current on loan payments. Sameeffect: The economy suffers.   But there are even more vital elements involved.   Except for home mortgage loans, interest on adjustable-rateconsumer loans will be taxed more heavily next year. Currently, 40percent of interest escapes federal income taxes. Next year, thedeductible percentage drops to 20.   Rising interest rates and falling deductibility, therefore, canproduce a one-two punch that could put some folks down for the count.   Moreover, many of these consumer loans are for periodsconsiderably longer than just a decade ago, and that too can createproblems. Car loans are made for as long as five years now, whichoften may be longer than the life of the car.   Stress already is becoming serious in some automobile markets,with the repossession rate rising markedly this year. Butrepossession doesn't always resolve the problem. Some five-year-oldcars simply aren't worth taking back.   The corporate market has its own problems. Business demand forshort-term credit has been fueled by the surge of leveraged buyoutactivity. Some of these loans probably are poor to begin with, butan increase in interest rates, and perhaps an economic downturn aswell, might quickly turn them into bad loans.   It might not take much of a downturn to show how unsound some ofthese LBO loans are, because many were made on the basis of cashflow analyses that were optimistic even for a booming economy.   LBOs also are soaking up liquidity, threatening to limit fundsavailable for more productive activities. Illiquidity could developin 1989 because gross national product has been growing much fasterthan total bank reserves.   Congress could radically change the game too, although the chanceof it being able to do so within the next year is questionable.Still, it is possible that a Congress trying to reduce budgetdeficits might seek revenue by taxing some of the LBO debt. Rightnow, interest companies pay on LBO debt isn't taxed.   Perhaps the nicest thing that can be said about the creditsituation is that interest rates might not rise, as so manyforecasters expect and as Fed policy would seem to indicate.   Among others, for example, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. expects that aslowing of economic growth in 1989 will allow interest rates to fallsharply. But even if they do, there's an awful lot of debt out thereto be serviced.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Fri., Dec. 16.</NOTE></DOC>
