MACY andamp; Co. will receive a $600 million refinancing loan from a syndicate led by Swiss Bank Corp. The New York retailer will use the money to pay part of the $1.1 billion it borrowed from a group of banks earlier this year to acquire the Bullock's and I. Magnin retail chains from Campeau Corp. The interest rate on the new loan wasn't disclosed, but a Macy spokesman said the new loan carries a fixed rate, while the previous loan carries a variable rate. Macy went private through a $3.7 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
