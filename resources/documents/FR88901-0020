Introduction  </ITAG>Prior to the 1988 drought, demand was expected to exceed production, duein large part to high export demand. The supply and demand situation asof August 1988 shows a considerable tightening of stocks for wheat, feedgrains and soybeans due to the 1988 drought-reduced crops and continuedlarge disappearance. World grain stocks as a percent of total grain useas of the end of the 1988/89 season are now projected to be the lowestlevel since 1975; U.S. stocks compared with use will be the lowest since1981. For example, corn stocks on September 1, 1989, are expected to be1,576 million bushels, down 64 percent from September 1, 1988. In the 1988/89corn marketing year, total use is expected to exceed 1988 production byabout 2.8 billion bushels, necessitating market access to CCC-owned grainand grain pledged as collateral for prior crop loans in order to meet marketneeds. Similarly, wheat stocks are projected to be 597 million bushelson June 1, 1989, down 53 percent from June 1, 1988. These sharp reductionsin stocks have caused large increases in prices of food and feed grains.Cash market corn prices are up 30 percent. Since May, wheat is up 25 percent,and soybeans are up 20 percent.  The expected impacts with respect to rice is minimal or none due to themarketing loan program. Accordingly, this analysis does not address rice.A final regulatory impact analysis has been prepared with respect to the1988 Wheat, Feed Grain, Rice and Soybean CCC Programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background of Proposed Changes to 7 CFR Part 1421  </ITAG>CCC makes available price support to eligible producers through a varietyof means, including purchase agreements and nonrecourse loans. Producerswho comply with applicable program requirements are afforded the opportunityto obtain CCC price support loans for a term determined by CCC. These loansare made available in accordance with several sections of the AgriculturalAct of 1949, as amended (the 1949 Act). The terms and conditions of theloans are set forth in the loan agreement. <T3>See </T3>7 CFR 1421.1-1421.32 for feed grain, rice, soybean and wheatprice support loans and purchase agreements (53 FR 20280, June 3, 1988).In accordance with the provisions of the loan agreement and 7 CFR 1421.6,these loans mature no later than the last day of the ninth calendar monthfollowing the month in which the loan application is made, unless extendedby CCC. In the event CCC determines to extend such loans, the producerreceives actual notice of the terms and conditions of the offered extension.The producer is not, however, required to accept the offered extension. In accordance with section 110 of the 1949 Act, CCC may make availableextended price support loans to producers who have specified maturing regularwheat and feed grain price support loans. These loans are referred to asFarmer-Owned Reserve (FOR) Loans. The minimum and maximum levels of thewheat and feed grain reserves are determined annually. The terms and conditionsof the loans are set forth in the loan agreement. See 7 CFR 1421.740-54(53 FR 11,239, April 26, 1988).  Section 110 of the 1949 Act provides that, whenever the total quantityof wheat pledged as collateral for FOR loans is less than 300 million bushelsand the market price for wheat is less than 140 percent of the currentprice support level, entry into the reserve must be allowed. Currently,395 million bushels are in the FOR wheat reserve and wheat prices are inexcess of 140 percent of the current price support rate. With respect tofeed grains, the minimum FOR level is 450 million bushels and the minimummarket price is 140 percent of the current price support rate. Currently,1.06 billion bushels of corn, 54 million bushels of sorghum and 50 millionbushels of barley are in the FOR feed gran reserve. Corn prices exceed140 percent of the current price support rate. Prior to the enactment of the Food Security Act of 1985 (the 1985 Act),which amended section 110 of the 1949 Act, the term of a FOR loan couldnot exceed 5 years. The 1985 Act amended section 110 to provide for FORloans of not less than 3 years with extensions as warranted. However, priorto this amendment, producers possessed a substantial number of FOR loanswhich were maturing and, due to market conditions, the loan collateralwould be forfeited to CCC. In order to provide greater flexibility to producers,CCC established the Special Producer Storage Loan Program in accordancewith the CCC Charter Act, as amended. The terms and conditions of theseloans are set forth in the loan agreement. See 7 CFR 1421.900-1421.917. In January and March 1988, after evaluating existing and projected supplyand demand conditions for wheat and feed grains, CCC determined and announcedthat certain price support loans would be extended and that certain otherloans would not be extended. Accordingly, with respect to loans that werenot extended, producers are required to comply with the terms and conditionsof their loan agreements which require repayment of the loan or forfeitureto CCC of the loan collateral by a specified date.Following the announcement of these decisions, the State of Minnesota andseveral Minnesota producers brought an action in the United States DistrictCourt of the District of Minnesota which alleged that the actions takenconcerning these loans were not made in accordance with statutory requirements.Among the allegations, plaintiffs contend that these decisions were notmade in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, as amended, 5U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq. </T3>Subsequently, on July 22, 1988, based upon the UnitedStates Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, the United States DistrictCourt entered an order enjoining the use of two intra-agency notices whichwere used by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS)to notify State and County ASCS Offices of these decisions.  It is the position of CCC that the provisions of the Administrative ProcedureAct, as amended, are not applicable to these decisions since 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)specifically exempts agencies from conducting proposed rulemaking actionswith respect to ``a matter relating to agency management or personnel orto public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.'' It is alsothe position of CCC that the Statement of Policy signed by the Secretaryof Agriculture on July 20, 1971 (<T3>see </T3>36 FR 13804), which provided that, in certain specified instances,proposed rulemaking would be undertaken by all agencies of the Departmentnotwithstanding the exemption set forth in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) is not applicableto the types of actions involved in these decisions since proposed rulemakingactions would be impracticable.  However, in order to alleviate the concerns of interested parties regardingthe procedure which CCC utilized in making these decisions and to providemarket stability, comments were requested with respect to proposed amendmentsto the regulations of CCC which are set forth in Title 7 of the Code ofFederal Regulations. These proposed amendments would amend 7 CFR 1421.6to provide that 1987 and subsequent crop price support loans for feed grains,rice, soybeans and wheat would not be subject to any additional extensionof the original loan term of nine months. Section 1421.6 would also beamended to provide that 1985 and 1986 crop loans of wheat, barley, oats,and soybeans would not be extended at maturity and that producers with1985 and 1986 crop corn and grain sorghum loans which mature on March 31,1988 through and including December 31, 1988 would be provided the opportunityto extend such loans for one year. The proposed rule would also amend theFOR program regulations which are set forth at 7 CFR 1421.741 to providethat 1984 crop FOR loans which mature on March 31, 1988 through and includingDecember 31, 1988 may be extended for one year and that 1983 and priorcrop year FOR loans would not be extended.  The proposed rule would also amend the regulations at 7 CFR 1421.900-1421.917which set forth the regulations governing the special producer storageloan program. The basis for the program was explained in the preamble ofthe rule which set forth the initial regulations which established theprogram:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Farmer-Owned Grain Reserve Program has been implemented for wheat,corn, barley, sorghum, and oats in accordance with the provisions of section110 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended. Producers with maturedgrain reserve loans will have utilized the entire period of their reserveloan agreement which is available for the commodity. Normally, producerswith matured grain reserve loans would be required to redeem the loan collateralor forfeit the collateral to CCC in full satisfaction of the loan obligation.However, under the Special Producer Storage Loan Program, producers willbe given the opportunity to pledge the collateral securing a matured grainreserve loan as collateral for a loan obtained under the new program.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">50 FR 16221 (April 25, 1985).  The program was determined to be necessary since, at that time, section110 of the 1949 Act specified that FOR loan agreements could not be fora term in excess of 5 years. Section 110 of the 1949 Act was subsequentlyamended by the Food Security Act of 1985 by deleting the 5-year maximumlimitation and by providing that FOR loans could be extended as warrantedby market conditions. Accordingly, it has been determined that this programis no longer necessary. Therefore, the proposed rule would delete the regulationswhich set forth the provisions which were used to make Special ProducerStorage Loans and would also specify that maturing Special Producer StorageLoans will not be extended.  The quantities of outstanding CCC loan collateral as of August 17, 1988which would be affected by the proposed amendments are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <ITAG tagnum="96">[Millions of bushels] </ITAG><H1>Program crop year </H1><H1>Wheat </H1><H1>Corn </H1><H1>Sorghum </H1><H1>Barley </H1><H1>Oats </H1><H1>Soybeans</H1> Regular Loans: <ITAG tagnum="3">1985 </ITAG><D>6 </D><D>*76 </D><D>*4 </D><D>2 </D><D>0 </D><D>2 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">1986 </ITAG><D>23 </D><D>*454 </D><D>*27 </D><D>11 </D><D>0 </D><D>7 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">1987 </ITAG><D>29 </D><D>532 </D><D>11 </D><D>12 </D><D>0 </D><D>44 </D>Farmer-Owned Reserve (FOR) Loans: <ITAG tagnum="3">1983 andamp; Prior \1\ </ITAG><D>166 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>3 </D><D>0 </D><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="3">1984 </ITAG><D>*71 </D><D>*281 </D><D>*11 </D><D>*14 </D><D>*0 </D><D/><ITAG tagnum="3">1985 \2\ </ITAG><D>158 </D><D>781 </D><D>43 </D><D>33 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Special Producer Storage (SPSL) Loans <D>0 </D><D>110 </D><D>17 </D><D>25 </D><D>1 </D><D> </D><F>(Asterisks denote loans which would be available for extension.) </F><F>\1\ These loans do not begin to mature until 1990. </F><F>\2\ These loans do not begin to mature until 1989.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Basis For CCC's Actions Regarding CCC Price Support Loans In January and March 1988, CCC announced that certain CCC price supportloans would be extended and that certain loans would not be extended. CCCalso announced that 1987 crops of wheat and feed grains would not be allowedentry into the FOR. These decisions were based upon market conditions whichexisted at that time. Those decisions were based upon expected 1988 normalcrop production. In making these determinations, CCC took in account theimpact the decisions would have on producers of wheat, feed grains andsoybeans as well as on the ultimate users of these products. At that time, excessive surpluses of these crops existed as the resultof overproduction in previous years. These excessive surpluses had occurreddue in larger part to the loss of export markets from 1981-1985. In orderto reduce these excessive surpluses, the Food Security Act of 1985 amendedthe 1949 Act to mandate acreage reduction programs for wheat and feed grainsand also mandated the use of export enhancement programs. Accordingly,CCC's decisions in January and March 1988 were based in large part upona concern to maintain regained export markets. The U.S. share of exportmarkets for wheat had increased from 29 percent in the 1985-1986 marketingyear to 42 percent in the 1987-1988 marketing year, still below the 1981-1982marketing year level of 48 percent. With respect to corn, such U.S. sharehad increased from 58 percent in the 1985-1986 marketing year to 78 percentin the 1987-1988 marketing year, still below the 1979-1980 marketing yearlevel of 82 percent. By retaining these markets through the availabilityof grain from CCC inventory and from free stocks, U.S. producers wouldbe able to market larger quantities of 1988 and subsequent crops. At thattime, estimated 1988 crop production was projected to be less than thecombined total of 1988 projected uses and would result in sharp declinesin both total carryover stocks and free stocks. Accordingly, access toCCC stocks and loan collateral was determined to be necessary.However, the production of 1988 crops of many commodities, including wheat,feed grains and soybeans, has been severely reduced by the drought conditionswhich exist throughout major agricultural regions of the United States.For example, on May 10, 1988 the estimated 1988 production of corn was7.3 billion bushels. These estimates have declined to 5.2 billion bushelson July 12, 1988, and to 4.48 billion bushels on August 11, 1988. Thus,at this time, even greater accessibility to CCC inventory and loan collateralis necessary to meet demand than previously was determined to exist inJanuary and March 1988. Similarly estimated wheat production has fallenfrom 2.17 billion bushels to 1.82 billion bushels. While soybean productionhas fallen from 1.88 billion bushels in May 1988 to 1.47 billion bushelsin August 1988. The decrease in feed grain and soybean production, together with the reductionin other feed supplies, has caused significant and unexpected increasesin feed prices for livestock and poultry producers and has also resultedin the unavailability of feed in some regions of the country. These factorshave resulted in the liquidation of livestock herds and poultry flockswhich has adversely affected producers' income. The United States' supply of wheat has also been reduced due to the 1988drought. Coupled with the expansion of U.S. export markets during the pastyear, the drought has resulted in the smallest supply of U.S. wheat innearly a decade. Durum wheat production was reduced 41 percent from 1987,while other spring wheat production is down 53 percent. Similar reductionshave occurred as a result of the drought in 1988 oat and barley production.Barley production is down 45 percent and oat production, also down 45 percent,will be the lowest since 1866. Accordingly, substantial quantities of oatswill be imported into the U.S. during the next year. In summary, early 1988 estimates showed that the 1988 use of wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would exceed 1988 production thereby necessitatingaccess to CCC inventory and CCC loan collateral. The effects of the 1988drought further necessitate such accessibility. In order to ensure orderly marketing of these commodities, including 1988production, it has been determined that some crop year loans with 1988maturity dates will be extended until 1989. By allowing some crop yearloans to mature in accordance with the loan agreements previously enteredinto by producers with CCC and by allowing producers to extend certainother loans, CCC's action will provide: (1) Producers the opportunity todeliver grain into the market in an orderly fashion with very minimal forfeituresto CCC; (2) purchasers, both domestic and foreign, with reliable supplies,and (3) parties who transport and handle such commodities sufficient timeto determine the most efficient manner to move these commodities from theproducer to a consumer. Section 110 of the 1949 Act provides for the implementation of ``a programunder which producers of wheat and feed grains will be able to store wheatand feed grains when such commodities are in abundant supply, extend thetime period for their orderly marketing, and provide for adequate but notexcessive carryover stocks to ensure a reliable supply of the commodities.''It is generally accepted that an adequate carryover supply of wheat is.75 ^1.0 billion bushels and that an adequate carryover supply of cornis 1.5 ^2.0 billion bushels. Sections 107D and 105C of the 1949 Act provide,with respect to wheat and feed grains, respectively, that if the estimatedcarryover on the first day of the marketing year for a crop will exceed1 billion bushels for wheat, and 2 billion bushels for corn, acreage reductionprograms must be implemented. As of August 29, 1988, ending 1988/89 marketingyear wheat stocks are estimated to be 597 million bushels and ending 1988/89marketing year corn stocks are estimated to be 1.58 billion bushels. Accordingly,assuming that the quantities specified in sections 105C and 107D are adequatecarryout quantities, the U.S. will have minimally adequate or less thanadequate carryovers of these crops going into the 1989 marketing year.Section 110 of the 1949 Act provides that the FOR program is to be conductedonly when wheat and feed grains are in ``abundant supply.'' Such suppliesare clearly not abundant and are projected to be below even ``adequatecarryover'' levels. Section 110 also provides that the FOR must be conductedin a manner which does not curtail free market activity. Further entryof grain into the FOR would, by the end of the marketing year, result inrecord high levels of grain in the FOR and would cause serious market disruptions.Based upon these estimates, entry of any further crops into the FOR wouldnot only be contrary to market demands but would also violate the provisionsof section 110 of the 1949 Act which require that free market activitynot be disrupted.Currently the following quantities are in the FOR as of August 17: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp0,i1,s100,15,15,15,15,15 </C>  <ITAG tagnum="96">[Millions of bushels] </ITAG><H1>Program crop year </H1><H1>Wheat </H1><H1>Corn </H1><H1>Sorghum </H1><H1>Barley </H1><H1>Oats </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1983 and prior <D>166 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1984 <D>71 </D><D>281 </D><D>11 </D><D>14 </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1985 <D>158 </D><D>781 </D><D>43 </D><D>33 </D><D>0</D><R>n,s,s,s,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>395 </D><D>1,062 </D><D>54 </D><D>50 </D><D>0 </D></ITAG> Wheat FOR loans for 1983 and prior crops do not begin to mature until 1990and 1985 wheat and feed grain FOR loans begin to mature early in 1989.Accordingly, sufficient quantities of FOR loan collateral exist and arein excess of statutory minimums set forth in section 110 of the 1949 Actwhich must be maintained when prices fall below specified levels. On July 7, 1988, CCC published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a proposed notice of determination with respectto the entry of 1988 crops into the FOR. No comments were received duringthe 30-day comment period. CCC proposed to allow entry into the FOR onlyif market prices for wheat and feed grains fell below 140 percent of therespective 1988 crop price support rate and if levels in the FOR fell below300 million bushels of wheat and 450 million bushels of feed grains. Subsequently,the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act) was enacted principallyin response to the 1988 drought. The 1988 Act provided approximately $3.9billion of disaster related relief measures to producers affected by the1988 drought and other specified natural disasters. Included in the 1988 Act were provisions which relate to the FOR Program.Section 303(b) of the 1988 Act provides greater accessibility to FOR stockswhich are acquired through the exchange of CCC commodity certificates.Section 303(a) of the 1988 Act provides that, once market prices of a commodityattain the FOR release level during the 1988 marketing year, producersmay repay, without penalty, FOR loans during the remainder of such marketingyear without regard to market prices. The Joint Explanatory Statement ofthe Committee of Conference which was prepared in connection with the 1988Act states as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees believe that the Secretary should operate the farmerowned reserve in a way that will remove wheat and feed grains from themarket during times of surplus supply and increase market supply duringtimes of short supply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Current farmer owned reserve quantities of wheat and feed grains exceedstatutory minimums. The Secretary has previously determined not to allowentry of 1987 crops of wheat and feed grains into the reserve. In makingany subsequent determination as to whether to permit entry of 1988 or othercrops of such commodities into the reserve, the Secretary should take intoconsideration the reduced production of 1988 crops of wheat and feed grainsas a result of the drought, the size of the farmer owned reserve, the impactof such entry upon the availability of these commodities in the marketplace,including, but not limited to consideration of the impact on the domesticlivestock and poultry industry, the ethanol industry, and export marketshare. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">See 134 Cong. Rec. H. 6474 (daily ed. Aug. 8, 1988). Accordingly, in addressing the manner in which the FOR is to be conducted,Congress has specifically recognized that statutory FOR minimums have beenmaintained and that entry of 1987 crops will not be permitted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>In response to that portion of the August 10, 1988 proposed rule whichrelates to the proposed amendment of 7 CFR Part 1421, 21 letters containing31 comments were received. In addition, one telephone comment was received.Comments were received from individuals, grain companies, three chairmenof three committees of the National Grain and Feed Association, the Commissionerof Agriculture and the Attorney General of Minnesota, a county ASC committee,producer organizations, a bee company, the Rural Life Office, and a bordercollie breeder. The comment received from the bee company was not responsive to the proposedrule since it addressed the issue of honey loan extensions. The proposedrule did not address CCC honey price support loans. One comment stated that no loan extensions should be granted since a majorityof producers no longer have 1987 crop price support loans outstanding andthese producers do not have the opportunity to benefit from any extensionof such loans. One comment was received in support of CCC's proposed amendment of 7 CFRPart 1421. This comment noted that, given current production and carryoverlevels, the market's need for this grain is critical and new or additionalextensions would have the effect of artificially isolating these stocksfrom the market thereby aggravating a tight supply-demand situation. This commenter noted that extensions would be contrary to the market-orientedintent of the Food Security Act of 1985 and would damage the U.S. statusas a reliable exporter. The commenter stated that extensions of some ofthese loans previously were made by CCC in a time of relative surplus andnot for the purpose of creating artificial scarcity in times of relativeshortages. The commenter also noted that it will take some time throughnormal market movements for grain that had been pledged as collateral formaturing loans to be positioned and available for the market. The commenterfurther noted that CCC's exposure to loan forfeitures would be minimaldue to current market conditions. CCC concurs in the view that it would be inequitable at this time to allowextensions of some 1987 crop loans since not all producers in the southernregion of the United States would be able to take advantage of such anextension. As of August 17, 1988, only 6 percent of 1987 wheat and 13 percentof corn price support loans remained outstanding. CCC also concurs with the analysis provided by the second commenter thatany further loan extensions would, in general, result in the loss of U.S.status as a reliable exporter. The views of the commenter are also consistentwith the discussion of the basis for CCC's actions previously set forthin this document. Seven comments suggested that, by allowing loan extensions, more orderlymarketing of grain would occur. Three of these comments suggested limitingany extension to six months, one of which suggested that any storage paymentswhich would be made should not be made until the loan is settled. As noted in the previous discussion of CCC's basis for only extending onlycertain loans, orderly marketing will occur as a result of this proposedamendment. Further, by extending all loans, CCC would merely delay untilnext year any possible effect on the market that may occur upon maturityof these loans. Current storage availability and transportation facilitiesare more than adequate to handle 1988 crop production which is marketedas well as grain which will enter the market from those loans which maturein accordance with their stated maturity dates. No data was provided byany commenter that supported the view that, by extending loans, even fora six month period, any more orderly marketing would occur than if suchloans are not extended. Delaying the payment of storage payments until the loan is settled wouldnot result in orderly marketing making storage payments either in advanceor on a delayed basis would merely create a disincentive for a producerto follow market forces when deciding whether or not to market a commoditysince the producer would have an artificial incentive to hold the commodity.Further, it is not the purpose of CCC to expend its limited funds for producersto store commodities in times of reduced production and high prices. CCCoffers storage payments to producers in certain instances in order to encourageproducers to store grain when surpluses exist until the grain can enterthe market in situations such as those which have existed throughout 1988.As noted in the previous discussion of CCC's actions, loan extensions aremade available by CCC in times of surplus in order to encourage orderlymarketing. Once market prices have exceeded the CCC price support level,the purpose of the CCC price support loan has been attained, i.e., to guaranteea producer a specified minimum price for the commodity. Since the formulationof the price support loan concept over 50 years ago, it has not been anobjective of the price support program to ensure that, at the expense ofCCC's limited funding authority, producers receive a market price in excessof the price support level. Producers who wish to speculate that priceswill continue to remain in excess of the price support level after thematurity of their price support loan may redeem the loan collateral andretain control of the commodity until such time as they wish to marketthe commodity. In addition, traditional marketing devices, such as contingencymarkets and forward contracting, are available to producers which willallow producers to take advantage of potentially high future market pricesif the producers wish to speculate in the market. As noted in the discussion in response to the comments which addressedthe concern for orderly marketing, market prices exceed current price supportlevels. Accordingly, producers who wish to speculate that higher priceswill occur may redeem their loan collateral and market their commodityat a future date if they so desire. Five comments suggested that, by allowing loan extensions, stabilized orenhanced market prices would be available to producers. Four comments expressed concern that the current drought and the recentlyenacted emergency livestock provisions of the Drought Assistance Act of1988 should be taken into consideration in making the decision as to whetherloan extensions should be authorized. These comments suggest that loanextensions would be warranted due to these events. Significant decreases in 1988 production of wheat, feed grain and soybeansand other feed supplies have occurred as a result of the 1988 drought.Liquidation of livestock herds and poultry flocks has occurred due to unexpectedand significant increases in feed prices and due to the unavailabilityof feed in some regions of the country. Accordingly, CCC has implementedemergency feed programs in order to alleviate the impact of the droughton these producers. To allow all loans to be extended would create artificialincentives in the market and would only result in even tighter feed supplieswhich would further injure livestock and poultry producers. Extensionsof all loans would also be contrary to the objectives of the emergencyfeed programs conducted by CCC, as required by the Disaster AssistanceAct of 1988, which provide that CCC will make available to livestock andpoultry producers CCC-owned inventory at prices which are below currentprice support levels. Five comments were received which stated that announcements of decisionswhich are made with respect to loan extensions should be made in a moretimely manner. Several of these comments noted that the decision to extendJuly 31, 1988, maturing loans was not made in a manner which allowed producersto take advantage of this option. Two comments also stated that producerswhose loans matured earlier in the year were not afforded the same opportunityto extend their loans. Two comments also requested that the comment periodbe extended. CCC notifies producers with maturing price support loans of the optionsavailable to them with respect to the settlement of their loans. Generally,producers receive actual notice of these options 45 days in advance ofmaturity. However, an injunction was issued on July 22, 1988 in a lawsuitinvolving CCC's earlier announcement of certain loan extension and FORentry decisions. CCC received notice of this injunction on July 26, 1988.As soon as CCC had reviewed the situation presented by the injunction,CCC announced on July 29, 1988, that loans maturing on July 31, 1988 wouldbe extended. This extension was made available in order to provide marketstability until CCC could fully determine the actions which were requiredby the injunction. In order to provide further stability to commodity markets, CCC publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking on August 10, 1988 in order to correctany possible procedural deficiencies which may exist concerning its announcementof price support loan extensions and FOR entry. Accordingly, producershave had sufficient notice of its proposed actions. The comment period for the proposed rule was limited to 15 days in orderthat a decision regarding these loans could be made prior to their maturityon August 31, 1988. Many purchasers of grain, including livestock and poultryproducers, and handlers of grain had made commitments well in advance ofthe July 22, 1988 injunction. In order to analyze all comments which werereceived in response to the proposed rule and to reduce market uncertaintyand maintain stability, the comment period ended August 25, 1988. Price support loans which are made available to wheat, feed grain, riceand soybean producers provide that such loans will mature the last dayof the ninth month following the month in which the loan application ismade. The length of the loan is structured in a manner which will allowgrain from one crop to enter the market prior to the harvest of the followingcrop. By limiting the length of the loan to 9 months, staggered entry ofcommodities occurs throughout the nation in a manner which correspondsto normal harvesting patterns, i.e., loans in the southern region of theUnited States mature the earliest and those in the northern region maturethe latest. This staggered entry provides for market price stability andfor the entry of sufficient stocks into the market in an orderly manner.Accordingly, by further extending price support loans with maturity datesof July 31, and August 31, until September 30, normal marketing and handlingpatterns will be severely disrupted since 1988 crops will be in the processof being harvested and will be in the process of being placed in storagefacilities by producers. Due to the 1988 drought, harvest will begin muchearlier than normal in most areas of the country. Accordingly, decisionsby CCC regarding July 31, and August 31, 1988 maturing loans must be madeprior to August 31, in order to allow producers to make necessary marketingdecisions. Further, the decisions which are made by CCC regarding theseloans will impact all producers who will be harvesting 1988 crops, andnot just producers with maturing CCC loans, since they too must make arrangementsconcerning the storage, shipment and sale of their crop. Accordingly, goodcause exists for not providing a longer comment period since a longer commentperiod would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Two comments stated that, by extending these loans, the government wouldincur lower storage costs than by storing grain in commercial storage facilities.By not extending certain loans, the storage payments which would have beenmade under such loans would have exceeded any increase in CCC storage andhandling costs which may be incurred on any forfeitures that occur as theresult of the adoption of the proposed rule.CCC projects that few if any forfeitures will occur as the result of itsproposed amendment to 7 CFR Part 1421 since market prices exceed currentprice support levels. Approximately 99 percent of all 1987 crop year loansettlements which have occurred from January 29, 1988 through August 17,1988 have been loan repayments. For all crop year loans which were settledin this period, approximately 93 percent of all loans were repaid. Producersmay also use commodity certificates to profitably acquire and market anygrain which has been pledged as collateral for any CCC price support loanwhich has a repayment value per bushel which exceeds current market prices.Further, CCC inventory is continuing to decline and uncommitted wheat stockswill likely be less than 50 million bushels by December 31, 1988 and maywell approach zero. Uncommitted CCC corn stocks will likely be less than200 million bushels by such time. By comparison, the quantities of wheatand corn in CCC inventory as of August 1, 1987, were 808 million and 1.47billion bushels, respectively.Five comments were received with respect to the effect that the proposedrule has on litigation currently pending which involves CCC's earlier decisionsnot to allow extension of certain crop year loans or to allow entry intothe FOR.It is CCC's position that the injunction issued on July 22, 1988 prohibitedthe implementation of two intra-agency notices. Absent these notices, allloans maturing in 1988 would not be extended and entry into the FOR wouldnot be permitted. The injunction did not prohibit the use of other existingauthority of CCC and did not preclude CCC from conducting a rulemakingactivity in order to remove any possible procedural deficiency which mayexist.One comment merely stated that farmers are under stress and that actionsshould not be taken which give grain companies an additional advantageover them.The proposed amendments to 7 CFR Part 1421 are not intended to provideany advantage to grain companies or to any other party. The amendmentsare intended to provide adequate supplies of grain in the market withoutimposing an artificial barrier to the market such as through the paymentof unnecessary storage payments to producers.One comment agreed with the proposal of giving producers actual noticeby mail of any future extensions. The commenter also stated that this noticeshould be given at least 14 days prior to loan maturity.As noted previously, it is the current policy of CCC to provide sufficientand timely notice to producers of offered loan extensions. Since CCC hashistorically provided actual notice approximately 45 days in advance ofmaturity, the suggestion that such notice be made at least 14 days in advancehas been rejected.One comment stated that the Special Producer Storage Loan Program shouldnot be terminated since it could be used in the future if crop surplusesoccur. One commenter agreed with the proposal, noting that the continueduse of the program contravenes the intent of the Food Security Act of 1985.This commenter also stated that, for the same reasons previously set forthin support of CCC's proposal to not extend certain loans, that this programshould also be terminated.As noted previously, the Special Producer Storage Loan Program was establishedin 1985 since CCC could not have FOR loans with a term in excess of 5 years.At the then prevailing market prices, producers would have forfeited largequantities of the maturing FOR loan collateral. In order to provide greaterflexibility to producers by allowing producers to retain control of thisgrain, the Special Producer Storage Loan Program was established. Subsequently,the Food Security Act of 1985 amended section 110 of the 1949 Act to removethe restriction that FOR loans cannot be for a term of longer than 5 years.Accordingly, the need for this program no longer exists.Two comments stated that the proposal to delete from existing regulationsthe authority for CCC to extend 1987 and subsequent crops should not beadopted since it is too premature to determine whether future extensionsare warranted.Extensions of CCC price support loans have been made available when largesurpluses of commodities exist. The purpose of these extensions has beento allow producers to retain control of the loan collateral beyond theinitial loan maturity date in lieu of forfeiting the collateral. When determiningwhether to offer such extensions, CCC takes into consideration whetherit is likely that prices will reach the point that loan repayments arelikely to occur and the market demand for the commodity. Extensions of1984-1986 crop year loans were authorized due to depressed market prices,excessive supplies, tight storage situations and large CCC inventories.These conditions do not currently exist. Further, due to the large reductionin 1988 production, these situations are not projected to occur in the1988/89 marketing year.In order to remove the possibility of encountering any further concernswith respect to the procedural manner in which loan extension determinationsare made, CCC has determined that 7 CFR Part 1421 will specifically providethat no extensions will be made. However, in the event market and storageconditions and CCC inventory levels change which would warrant the extensionof subsequent crop year loans, CCC would still be authorized to take suchaction. But, in implementing such a decision, CCC would be required topublish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> an amendment to 7 CFR Part 1421 in order to effectuateany such extension. Therefore, all interested parties would receive sufficientnotice of such change.One comment stated that the proposed rule should set forth standards whichwould be used to determine when loan extensions would be granted or entryinto the FOR would be permitted.When determining whether to offer loan extensions or to allow entry intothe FOR, CCC must take into consideration conditions existing at that time.A myriad of factors must be considered. These factors include existingand projected market prices; foreign and domestic market demands; weatherconditions; livestock, ethanol, and poultry industry concerns; storagecapacities; foreign agricultural subsidy actions; humanitarian and domesticemergency relief measures; and CCC budgetary restrictions. CCC must alsotake into consideration statutory requirements applicable to determinationsinvolving wheat and feed grain acreage reduction programs which take intoconsideration projected carryover supplies. Accordingly, since these factorsas well as other factors are continually changing, the suggestion thatspecific standards be set forth in 7 CFR Part 1421 is rejected.This commenter also noted that factors other than the statutory FOR minimumswhich are set forth in section 110 of the 1949 Act must be taken into considerationwhen allowing entry into the FOR. The commenter also stated that, by allowingthe extension of 1984 crop FOR loans only, quantities in the FOR will fallbelow the statutory minimum. The commenter further stated that since Congresshas provided in the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988 for the release ofFOR grain without penalty any time during the 1988 marketing year if marketprices attain the release level during such year, Congress has indicatedthe manner in which private stocks should enter the market.This commenter also noted that if the Secretary perceives that an emergencysituation exists which requires the release of FOR stocks, such authorityis already provided for in section 110 of the 1949 Act. As noted in the previous discussion of the basis for CCC's actions regardingprice support loan extensions and entry into the FOR, section 110 of the1949 Act provides for the implementation of ``a program under which producersof wheat and feed grains will be able to store wheat and feed grains whensuch commodities are in abundant supply, extend the time for their orderlymarketing, and provide for adequate, but not excessive, carryover stocksto ensure a reliable supply of the commodities.'' CCC has always takenthese and other factors into consideration when determining whether toallow entry into the FOR. However, it should be noted that section 110of the 1949 Act provides that such a program shall be available when ``suchcommodities are in abundant supply.'' Current supplies of wheat and feedgrains have been significantly reduced by the 1988 drought. For the purposesof determining adequate carryover levels in carrying out domestic pricesupport programs and related activities, ending 1988/89 marketing yearstocks will be minimally adequate or below such levels. Projected endingwheat stocks total 597 million bushels, with 395 million bushels currentlyin the FOR. Projected ending corn stocks total 1.58 billion bushels, with1.1 billion bushels currently in the FOR. Approximately 65-70 percent ofboth wheat and feed grain carryover stocks are now in the FOR. These aboutequal the highest shares of ending stocks accounted for by FOR loan collateralsince the FOR was first implemented in 1977. By comparison, ending 1987/88corn stocks were 4.35 billion bushels with 1.2 billion in the FOR or approximately27 percent. As noted before, additional entry into the FOR would resultin a record high share of ending stocks being in the form of FOR loan collateral.Allowing further entry into the FOR will severely disrupt free market activitycontrary to the provisions of section 110 of the 1949 Act which providethat the FOR must be implemented in a manner which does not ``unduly depress,manipulate or curtail the free market.''The commenter also stated that entry into the FOR must be allowed in orderto fulfill Congressional policies subject to the upper limits set forthin section 110 of the 1949 Act and, when FOR amounts fall below the minimumlevels and ``prices are below release level'', incentives must be offeredto encourage participation in the FOR.For the immediately foregoing reasons, entry of additional quantities ofwheat and feed grains would not be in accordance with the provisions ofsection 110 of the 1949 Act and would, therefore, be contrary to Congressionalpolicy.The commenter also stated that levels in the FOR will fall below statutoryminimums if the proposed rule is adopted.CCC has always maintained levels in the FOR which are in excess of statutoryminimum requirements. Current FOR levels are 395 million bushels for wheatand 1.06 billion bushels for corn; 166 million bushels of 1980-1983 FORwheat loans do not begin to mature until 1990, and 158 million bushelsof 1985 crop wheat loans do not begin to mature until 1989. The 1985 cornFOR loans also do not begin to mature until early 1989 and total 781 billionbushels. Accordingly, the commenter's conclusion that insufficient FORlevels will result is simply in error. As provided in the proposed amendmentto 7 CFR 1421.741, additional extensions of 1984 and 1985 may be offered.Extensions of 1980-1983 crop wheat FOR loans are not provided for sincethe amendments that were made to section 110 of the 1949 Act by the FoodSecurity Act expire with the 1990 crop. Decisions regarding the 1990 cropyear will be made at that time in accordance with then existing statutoryrequirements.The commenter also stated that due to section 303 of the ``Drought ReliefBill'' (sic) ``there is no reason to doubt that the FOR will draw downeven further.'' The commenter provides no economic support for this statement.Section 303(a) of the Drought Assistance Act of 1988 provides that, withrespect to the 1988 marketing years only, producers may repay FOR loansthroughout such year without the payment of any penalty once market pricesreach the FOR release level. The 1988 marketing year FOR release levelis $4.23 per bushel for wheat and $2.93 per bushel for corn. The most recentUSDA World Outlook Board projections show for 1988/89 season average priceof $3.45-$3.95 for wheat and $2.30-$2.70 for corn. Thus, market pricesmay not reach release levels, if at all, for some time. Further, giventhe incentive of receiving storage payments there is no assurance thatproducers will avail themselves of this option in any event.The commenter also stated that since the action proposed in January wasto handle a surplus and the action proposed in August was in response toa drought, the justification provided for in the proposed rule was a ``meresham.''As more fully discussed throughout this document, the initial determinationswere based upon assumptions that 1988 demand would exceed 1988 production.This situation was obviously worsened due to the 1988 drought. Accordingly,the fundamental basis for this action still remains the same, i.e., thecontinued availability of sufficient stocks to meet current export anddomestic demand. The commenter stated that if the Secretary perceives that an emergencyexists which requires release of FOR stocks, the Secretary may, in accordancewith section 110(d) of the 1949 Act, call FOR loans prior to maturity afterreporting the determination and reasons to the President and to the Congress.Given current supplies, the Secretary may, at some subsequent date, haveto resort to calling non-maturing loans. However, the proposed amendmentsaffect maturing loans and not non-maturing loans. As discussed above, allowingfurther entry into the FOR at this time would be contrary to the provisionsof section 110 of the 1949 Act since free markets would be unduly disrupted.Also, as noted by another commenter, delivery of grain into market accessiblepositions cannot be done immediately upon loan maturity. Accordingly, byallowing entry into the FOR and, in the near future, calling FOR loanswould not necessarily result in timely access to these stocks. Also, bynot allowing further entry of grain into the FOR, the possibility of theoccurrence of emergency conditions which would necessitate the callingof other FOR loans will be reduced. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1421 </ITAG>Grains, Loan programs/agriculture, Price support programs, Warehouses.Accordingly, Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1421_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
