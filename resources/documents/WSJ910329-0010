The new prototype device is expected to be used as a newlight source for optical information storage products,replacing conventional semiconductor lasers, Toshiba said inTokyo.</LP><TEXT>   The new device emits a laser with a maximum optical outputpower of 106 milliwatts, or mW, at a wavelength of 690nanometers, or nm. Conventional devices, used as lightsources to read and write data for storage products such aselectronic document filing systems and CD-ROMs, emit aninvisible laser beam with 30mW of output power and an 830nmwavelength.   Toshiba said demand is increasing for devices with higheroutput power and a shorter wavelength in order to store dataat a higher density and read the data more accurately. Thehigher the density becomes, the more power is required forwriting and reading data.</TEXT></DOC>
