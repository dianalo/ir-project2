The fainter part of the luminosity function canbe described as a power law that does not change with redshift. The turnoverto a steeper slope occurs at high luminosity at higher redshift. Thedependence on redshift of this feature in the luminosity-surface densitydiagram is continuous; no evidence is seen for a cutoff in redshift atany luminosity. A new model for the evolution is proposed that adequatelydescribes the data for z greater than one. The emissivity due to QSOsis determined as a function of redshift, and it is shown that, underconventional assumptions, the observed QSOs cannot explain the levelof ionization of the intergalactic medium implied by the Gunn-Petersontest. 45 references.</TEXT></DOC>
