She addressed a banquet given by Morrocan King Hassan II at thestart of an African tour that also will take her to Nigeria,Zimbabwe and Malawi.   Mrs. Thatcher noted Hassan's 1986 meeting with then-IsraeliPremier Shimon Peres, which drew fire from some other Arab nations.   ``Nothing is ever lost by exploring the views of one'sopponents,'' she said. ``That is an example from which Israel canlearn.''   The remark appeared to be another suggestion that Israel meetwith the Palestine Liberation Organization.   British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said on avisit to Israel last month that Israeli leaders should accept thePLO as a negotiating partner. Waldegrave met in January with PLOchief Yasser Arafat.   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization despiteArafat's renunciation of terrorism in December and his recognitionof Israel's right to exist, a move that opened the way for theU.S.-PLO dialogue now in progress.   ``Never has the need for a solution (to the Arab-Israeliconflict) been more urgent,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the royal banquet.``The proliferation of weapons, including chemical weapons and theballistic missiles to deliver them, brings home to us the horrorsof a further conflict.   ``No one should be in doubt that the present situation in theMiddle East is fundamentally unstable and cannot continue.''   She said an international conference would provide the ``right''framework for negotiations.   Successful negotiations must include ``the direct involvement ofrepresentatives of the Palestinian people from inside and outsidethe occupied territories,'' she said, as well as U.S. influencewith Israel and support of the permanent members of the U.N.Security Council.   The United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and Francecomprise the five permanent members.   Mrs. Thatcher said she would like to see Britain and Moroccomake a cooperative effort to bring the Israelis and Palestinianstogether.   Her talks with Hassan were to focus on the Mideast,British-Moroccan ties and Moroccan relations with the EuropeanEconomic Community.   In an interview with the official Moroccan news agency MAP, Mrs.Thatcher expressed her assent with Morocco's wish for strengthenedeconomic ties with the EEC. Morocco has vainly sought entry intothe trading bloc.   Greeted at the rain-drenched airport by Premier Azzedine Laraki,Mrs. Thatcher was ceremonially offered a bowl of milk and datesupon her arrival Monday before attending a luncheon given byHassan's wife and three daughters.   The British prime minister's aides said before her departurethat she would launch a southern African peace initiative duringher one-week trip.   She said in a radio interview broadcast on Saturday, however,that she could not go to South Africa until Nelson Mandela, jailedleader of the African National Congress, is released.</TEXT></DOC>
