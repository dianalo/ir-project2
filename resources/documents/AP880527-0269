The recent Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip has created strains for them but it has alsobrought new levels of cooperation and understanding to thecommunity's 14 families _ nine Jewish, five Israeli Arab.   ``It's paradoxical,'' said Abed Najah, an Arab who is thevillage secretary. ``The uprising has made us stronger. We are morecertain than ever that what we are doing is the best and mostimportant thing to do.''   Those who came to live in the village that once was a no man'sland 15 miles west of Jerusalem chose to span the national andreligious divide that splits Israeli Jews and Arabs into hostileand suspicious groups.   Here they share authority, educate their children in Hebrew andArabic, and try to spread a message of tolerance to visitingIsraeli high school children through special seminars in their``School of Peace.''   Living together for a decade has never been simple, however.   Arab residents had to fight for official recognition for theArabic name for the village, Wahati Al-Salaam. Also, under acompromise agreement, Jews observe the Israeli Independence Dayholiday while Arabs do not.   But the 70 residents are determined to find an alternative tothe current realities of Arab-Jewish relations.   Outside Neve Shalom, tensions between Arabs and Jews have beenseriously exacerbated over the past five months by the Palestinianuprising.   Neve Shalom has been largely protected from the tensions,according to Ariella Beeri, 29, an Israeli spokeswoman for theSchool of Peace and a longtime resident of the village.   ``The uprising was not new for anyone who already developedsocial and political awareness,'' she said. ``We have always beenaware of the reality of the occupation.''   Jews and Arabs in Neve Shalom regard the Arab revolt as a signthat the Palestinians have taken responsibility for their own fate.   ``I am very proud of the uprising,'' said Najah, the villagesecretary. ``Today the Palestinians are writing the brightest pageof their history.''   Until now, Neve Shalom, or Wahati Al-Salaam, avoided politics soas not to drive away Jewish high school children from the School ofPeace seminars.   But the Palestinian uprising has changed that. Recently all 70Neve Shalom residents demonstrated in Jerusalem against what theyview as excessively harsh measures used by the Isreali army tosupress Palestinian demonstrators.   Neve Shalom also has set up exchange visits with the nearby WestBank village of Bet Sira and has sent its residents food supplies.   ``We visited just after the soldiers were there,'' said Najah.``We saw the fear in their eyes, and how the women and childrenstank of tear gas.''   ``We always thought of Neve Shalom as an educational project,''he added. ``But we've seen lately that things are happening thatforce us to take action.''   The residents of Neve Shalom are reluctant to discuss tensionscaused in their community by the Palestinian uprising. But oneespecially sensitive point is military reserve duty, required ofJewish residents of Neve Shalom but not the Arabs.   So far, none of the four residents called up have been sent tothe West Bank or Gaza Strip.   ``The village doesn't tell them what to do,'' said Ms. Beeri.``But there's a lot of social pressure for them not to serve in theoccupied territories. If they go, it will be hard for them to facethe others.''   Ms. Beeri says the uprising has altered relations between theJewish and Arabs students who come for the peace seminars, however.   ``The uprising is strengthening the Arabs. It is giving them thefeeling that someone is looking out for their interests. The Jewsare frightened by the power of the uprising, by how close it is tothem geographically.''   The seminar talks also have taken on a new urgency. The Jewishhigh school students see the issues as personal and crucial.   They are only a year away from being drafted into the army andthat is likely to lead to direct and violent confrontation withPalestinians.   Beeri said one Jewish student put it succinctly when he saidgoodbye to Arab students at the end of a seminar.   ``See you again at the stone-throwing,'' he said.   End Adv Mon PMs June 6</TEXT></DOC>
