At the two-day conference of 68 nations on ways to slow or haltdangerous climatic changes, the United States, Japan and SovietUnion refused to commit themselves to stabilizing emissions ofcarbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000.   Environmentalists said the reservations to the final declarationwere a setback to efforts against the ``greenhouse effect,'' thegradual warming of Earth's atmosphere.   ``Less than six months ago in Paris, President Bush talked of theurgent need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Now, the White Househas sabotaged the first international effort to make good on thepresident's words,'' said Brooks Yeager of the National AudubonSociety, a U.S. environmental group.   The meeting's final declaration said: ``In the view of manyindustrialized nations, such stabilization of carbon dioxideemissions should be achieved as a first step at the latest by theyear 2000.''   It said a ``stable development of the world economy'' remainedessential and urged industrial nations to study ``the feasibility ofachieving targets to ... reduce carbon dioxide emission levels bythe year 2005.''   William K. Reilly, chief administrator of the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, told reporters the United States ``is not one ofthe countries that has agreed to go so far. ... While stabilizationis necessary, we must closely analyze the means to achieve that.''   Reilly said the proposed measures could only be implemented atgreat cost. It is estimated that hundreds of billions of dollarswould be needed to improve the fuel efficiency of cars andindustrial plants around the world.   In Washington, the White House issued a statement saying theUnited States had agreed to a compromise declaration saying thepollutants should be stabilized ``as soon as possible.''   Administration sources said U.S. negotiators felt they couldaccept that wording because it did not tie any nation to specificlevels of pollution reduction or require levels to be stabilized bya specific year.   One U.S. official, speaking privately, said the reviseddeclaration noted only that, ``in the view of many industrializednations'' but not necessarily all, carbon dioxide emissions shouldbe stabilized by 2000.   Stephen Hart, deputy presidential press secretary, said: ``We'renot willing to agree to a set time. We did not sign on to anythingmentioning the year 2000.''   Several developing nations, including India and China, voicedreservations at the conference.   The Netherlands, West Germany and the Scandinavian countries hadteamed with Canada in an unsuccessful effort to get unanimousapproval of such a commitment.   The Dutch sponsors of the conference and others also pushed toset a level at which the emissions of ozone-threatening gases wouldbe frozen by the end of the century.   Klaus Toepfer, the West German environment minister, took a lessbleak view.   ``Reilly and the others will take the message home that more isexpected of them,'' Toepfer told reporters. ``That means we'll havea better starting point for the next conferences.''   The U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change isto meet in Washington in February and the second World ClimateConference is to be held in late 1990.   Reilly said the United States is ``enthusiastically supporting,''those meetings and did not want to ``excessively influence'' them bycommitting itself to a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions atthe Noordwijk conference.   Those emissions, along with those of chlorofluorocarbons, methaneand nitrous oxides, are believed to be the major cause of the risein atmospheric temperatures.   About 65 percent of the emissions originate from industrializednations in the northern hemisphere, according to a recent report bythe Worldwatch Institute in Washington.   The Dutch Environment Ministry said the United States produces23.7-percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.   Scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turnsubtropical zones into deserts and coastal nations could facemassive inundations.</TEXT></DOC>
