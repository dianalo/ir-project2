<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-0704 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Two-Beam Accelerator (TBA) consists of a long high-gradient acceleratorstructure (HGS) adjacent to an equal-length Free Electron Laser (FEL).In the FEL, a beam propagates through a long series of undulators. Atregular intervals, waveguides couple microwave power out of the FEL intothe HGS. To replenish energy given up by the FEL beam to the microwavefield induction accelerator units are placed periodically along the lengthor the FEL. In this manner it is expected to achieve gradients of morethan 250 MV/m and thus have serious option for a 1 TeV {times} 1 TeVlinear collider. The state of present theoretical understanding of theTBA is presented with particular emphasis upon operation of the ``steady-state''FEL, phase and amplitude control of the rf wave, and suppression of sidebandinstabilities. Experimental work has focused upon the development ofa suitable HGS and the testing of this structure using the Electron LaserFacility (ELF). Description is given of a first test at ELF with a seven-cell2{pi}/3 mode structure which without pre-conditioning and with a not-very-goodvacuum nevertheless at 35 GHz yielded an average accelerating gradientof 180 MV/m.</TEXT></DOC>
