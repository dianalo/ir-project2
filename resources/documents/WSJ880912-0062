MMWEC, a Ludlow, Mass., consortium of municipally owned utilities, said the investors will provide as much as $30 million to cover MMWEC's share of the costs of keeping the plant ready to run.    Under the agreement, MMWEC will retain its 11.6% stake in Seabrook until the plant begins commercial operation. At that time, MMWEC's member utilities will be able to individually sell or retain their interest in the plant.    If Seabrook isn't licensed by the federal government and has to be canceled, MMWEC's share of the abandonment costs would be limited to $10 million under the agreement.    In return for the $30 million in financing, the investor group received contracts to sell electricity to other utilities with an interest in Seabrook. Profits from the sale of the electricity will enable the investors to recover their costs. Further details are expected to be disclosed soon.    The startup of Seabrook has been stalled by a controversy over an emergency evacuation plan. MMWEC said earlier this year that it wanted to withdraw from the project because of the expense of keeping it ready to run -- its share averages some $1.2 million a month -- and the uncertainty over the plant's future.    That uncertainty made it difficult for MMWEC to agree on a price with potential buyers of its stake. The plant is worth little or nothing if it is canceled, but its value is substantial if it goes into operation. MMWEC has invested some $875 million in Seabrook. As previously reported, Bechtel Group Inc., a large San Francisco construction company, had been leading a group negotiating to acquire MMWEC's stake.    Also complicating a sale was that some of the utilities belonging to MMWEC wanted to retain their interest in Seabrook and the electricity it could produce in the future, industry executives say.    The group of investors that will pick up MMWEC's share of the upkeep costs is expected to be identified this week. The agreement could remove one obstacle to Seabrook's licensing. Opponents of the plant have contended that MMWEC's pending withdrawal raised questions about the financial ability of Seabrook's owners to maintain and operate the plant.    Another obstacle could be removed on Friday by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The commission is expected to ease a rule requiring that emergency warning systems be installed in towns near the plant before a low-power testing license can be granted. Some towns have taken down or disconnected sirens because of opposition to the plant.    Anti-Seabrook groups have said that they will go to court to block low-power testing if such a license is granted. </TEXT></DOC>
