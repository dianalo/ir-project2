The government ordered a number of changes aimed at encouraging competition, including publication of the company's price schedule and limits on the amount of gas it can buy from North Sea producers.    But the government's action may have limited consequences. Even if strong competition materializes, it probably only would cut the company's revenue by about 1% to 2%, said Simon Irwin, an analyst at London stockbrokerage Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.    The long-awaited study by the government's Monopolies and Mergers Commission said British Gas's discrimination against certain contract customers was contrary to the public interest. The commission's investigation began in March in response to complaints of overcharging from British Gas industrial customers.    Lord Young, secretary for state and industry, instructed British regulators to seek voluntary ways for British Gas to implement the commission's recommendations. But if the company hasn't modified its practices by the end of January, Lord Young said he would invoke his powers under the Fair Trading Act to compel British Gas to act.    British Gas said the commission &quot;failed to accept the principles underlying the British Gas contract policy, which has operated for many years with the support of successive governments, most recently at the time of privatization.&quot; The company said it hoped agreement could be reached to allay the government's major concerns, but that it would need time to study the report before commenting further.    Analysts said the findings of the report had been widely expected. British Gas shares slipped four pence in London trading yesterday, to 170 pence ($2.97). </TEXT></DOC>
