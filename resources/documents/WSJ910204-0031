After nearly two decades in the gold and silver markets,Samuel Montagu joined the growing number of precious metalsdealers laying off traders in what is described as one of theindustry's biggest shakeouts.</LP><TEXT>   The ranks of precious metals dealers and bullion-dealingbanks swelled as gold surged to more than $500 an ounce atthe end of 1988 from around $280 in 1985. But since then thegold market has been jolted several times, first by increasedproduction and then by declining inflation, against whichgold had been a popular hedge. On the Commodity Exchange inNew York, gold for current delivery settled Friday at $366.10an ounce.   Last year, traders lost $10 million to $20 million, by oneSwiss dealer's estimate, when gold prices collapsed on a waveof Middle Eastern selling. Their latest lumps came with the$30-an-ounce tumble that gold took, after a brief rally, whenthe Persian Gulf war began in mid-January.   The retrenchment among dealers is world-wide. Faced with adownturn in precious metal activity and cost-cuttingpressures, banks and trading houses are shrinking or gettingrid of precious metals operations in Europe, the U.S. andAsia.   &quot;Wherever you go, people are being laid off,&quot; says TedArnold, a London-based precious metals analyst at MerrillLynch. &quot;There's just too many people chasing after too littlebusiness.&quot;   The London bullion market, the world's biggest and oldest,is particularly showing the strain. London Bullion MarketAssociation membership is down 10%. &quot;Similar to stock, bondand foreign exchange divisions, the precious metals market isalso encountering leaner times,&quot; says Robert Guy, chairman ofthe association and a director of N.M. Rothschild andamp; Sons.   Four senior people left Samuel Montagu mainly because ofproblems at its parent, Midland Bank PLC, bankers say. SharpsPixley Ltd., regarded by dealers as the most nimble Londongold and silver trading operation in the late 1970s and early1980s, closed its coin business and substantially scaled downits options and platinum operation, says Lesley Edgar, itsmanaging director.   &quot;We are still active, but we are concentrating on our mostprofitable business,&quot; he says.   Other dealers, including Union Bank of Switzerland, arequietly contracting or adjusting their business operations inLondon, dealers say. Major Swiss banks are concentrating ontheir own market in Zurich.   &quot;It is difficult to make money in precious metals at themoment,&quot; says Alfred Schneider, a senior vice president atSwiss Bank Corp. in Zurich.   In the U.S., the casualty list is also growing. Bank ofBoston, Citicorp's Citibank and Salomon Inc.'s SalomonBrothers Inc. have eliminated or cut substantially theirprecious metals trading operations. In some cases, othercompanies acquired the businesses and employees, as withDrexel Burnham Lambert and Citibank.   The financial institutions that got into gold in themid-1980s to expand their financing offerings are the onesthat are cutting back the most, says Martin Murenbeeld, aneconomist and head of a Victoria, British Columbia, preciousmetals consulting firm bearing his name.   Gold operations at major banks are coming under reviewbecause they aren't core businesses and their earnings arecyclical, says a gold bullion trader. &quot;The cuts have beenmost savage where houses haven't taken into account thecyclical nature of the business and geared up to service thebest part of the cycle,&quot; he says.   The troubles of the major British and U.S. houses arereverberating in Hong Kong and Australia as well. SharpsPixley, Bank of Boston and Samuel Montagu have closed orrestructured their Hong Kong offices. But the locally basedconcerns are still doing &quot;quite good business,&quot; says JonieLai, the Southeast Asia head of the World Gold Council, anindustry body.   That assessment is echoed by Victor Lam, managing directorof Shearson Lehman Commercial Corp. Asia: &quot;In this part ofthe world, there's enough business to sustain the industry.&quot;Some companies are having problems, he acknowledges, but theytend to be recent entrants that weren't able to buildadequate market share. &quot;Most of the names are still in thebusiness and still managing to make some money,&quot; he says.   Mr. Arnold of Merrill Lynch is skeptical that Hong Kong isfaring any better than other markets. &quot;I don't agree it'sdoing fine,&quot; he says. &quot;The Chinese like to trade gold, andit's still popular in Hong Kong. But it's nothing like theold {trading} volumes&quot; of several years ago.   The Australian market is going through a consolidation,reports Clive Carroll, executive director in charge of thebullion and commodities division at Macquarie Bank, thecountry's largest gold trader. &quot;We're alive and well but notprospering,&quot; Mr. Carroll says. &quot;We're making a living,whereas last year we were prospering.&quot;   Macquarie Bank doesn't anticipate any layoffs in itsprecious metals operation, Mr. Carroll says, but it doesn'tplan to hire anybody either.   Don Mackay-Coghill, chief executive officer of GoldCorpAustralia, a precious metals consulting firm, says that apartfrom U.S. companies withdrawing from the market, he isn'taware of any major gold trading concerns going out ofbusiness in Australia. Certainly, he says, the pressure is onas volume has declined and margins are squeezed, butestablished professionals are still performing.   The turmoil is painful for people losing their jobs, butsome analysts consider the shakeout healthy overall. &quot;It'sjust a natural thing,&quot; Mr. Arnold says. &quot;It's good old basiceconomics. Things expand, get overblown, and it comes backdown again.&quot;   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Some analysts are beginning to wonder whether the Mideastwar has lost its punch in world oil markets.   Certainly, any major negative developments in the war orIraqi hits on important Saudi oil facilities could send oilprices into rapid motion again. But last week, after monthsof volatility, oil markets seemed to have found a rarestability. Prices drifted in a relatively narrow range andseemed little affected by news from the Mideast.   &quot;The fundamentals are coming back into play; you can seeit,&quot; said Charles L. McSpadden, vice president of marketanalysis for Bonner andamp; Moore Associates Inc. The fundamentals,particularly crude oil supplies, are bearish, as he and someother analysts see them. Over the next few weeks, Mr.McSpadden said, &quot;the best we can look for is WTI {West TexasIntermediate} in the low $20s.&quot;   By the end of last week, the price paid in the oil fieldsfor this benchmark crude had generally settled at $20 abarrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, where a similarlight crude is traded, the March contract closed Friday at$21.34 a barrel, down 20 cents.   &quot;Price fluctuations may still provide some measure of thecontinuing nervousness about the Gulf war, but the volatilityhas become more clearly focused,&quot; the London-based EnergyCompass said at the weekend. &quot;Swings of crude oil were, forthe second week running, restricted to relatively narrowranges of between 40 and 45 cents on the calmer days and upto $1.30 to $1.45 on the more nervous days.&quot;                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders will study a government cattle survey due forrelease today for signs that the U.S. herd is increasing.   An increase would signal strengthening demand for cornbecause much of the crop is used to feed livestock, saidSusan Leighty, an analyst at Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc., New York.   Some livestock analysts expect the semiannual survey toshow that the number of U.S. cattle was up about 2% on Jan. 1from the same 1990 date.   Soybean analysts this week will closely watch growingconditions in Brazil, the world's second largest soybeanproducer. Dry weather earlier in the growing season hasrecently been relieved by widespread rains.   Analysts will also look at how a new round ofanti-inflation measures in Brazil might affect its farmersand the pace of its exports.</TEXT></DOC>
