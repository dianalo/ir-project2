The NASD, the self-regulatory group for member securitiesfirms in the over-the-counter stock market, also expelledPrinceton Financial and barred the two men from anyassociation with other NASD members. The fine and permanentbar from the NASD reflect an increasingly tougher position bymember firms on stopping colleagues who violate securitiesrules.</LP><TEXT>   Princeton Financial's case also reflects the NASD'simproved surveillance of price markups through electronicmonitoring of securities trades. An NASD spokesman noted thatmost of the other firms in this month's disciplinaryproceedings were cited for price-markup violations.   The NASD said Princeton Financial, based in Princeton,N.J., and Anthony J. Pontieri and Jerry F. Shorthouse, itsprincipals, agreed to the fine and other sanctions in asettlement. They neither admitted nor denied the allegedrules violations. In its complaint, the NASD said theycontrolled the market in common shares of VDG Capital Corp.,thus artificially setting retail prices of the securities tocustomers. It said that from June to November 1990, the firmcharged markups of at least 10% above appropriate value ofthe securities in most trades of VDG, for a total of about$372,000.   The NASD also charged the firm and Messrs. Pontieri andShorthouse with making an unsuitable recommendation of VDG,including exaggerated projections of price appreciation inVDG's stock, and failed to adequately inform investors of therisks in VDG, particularly the company's financial condition.No further information about VDG Capital was immediatelyavailable, including its location or if it still exists.   Because of the &quot;egregious&quot; nature of the allegedmisconduct, the NASD said, &quot;a fine far in excess&quot; of the$372,000 &quot;is clearly warranted.&quot; Further, the fine, althoughunlikely to be collected, serves to keep the firm and Messrs.Pontieri and Shorthouse out of the securities business, since&quot;their continued presence in the industry would pose asubstantial threat to public investors.&quot;   The NASD noted that Princeton and Mr. Shorthouse each werefined $20,000 in September for price-markup violations.   Princeton Financial ceased business last June. Messrs.Pontieri and Shorthouse couldn't be reached for comment.   The NASD also disciplined several other firms andindividuals for violations of securities laws andregulations. Unless otherwise noted, the firms andindividuals couldn't be reached for comment.
