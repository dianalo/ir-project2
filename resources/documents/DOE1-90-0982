The structure of 1 is composedof layers with composition, coinciding with compound composition. MoO/sub4/ tetrahedrons are bound in monodentate way with three zirconium atoms.Their coordination polyhedron is presented by ZrO/sub 6/ octahedrons,which occur due to coordination of six molybdate groups. It is shownthat 1 is the first investigated representative of crystallochemicalgroup of AT/sub 2//sup 3/ complexes. The absence of interlayer low-valentcations is the main feature, affecting crystallographic characteristicsof the compound. The character of electroneutral layer binding in thestructure of 1 was analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
