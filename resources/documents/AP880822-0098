(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker fell to hisknees when he and his wife, Tammy, asked for the forgiveness ofcharismatic Christians gathered for the Southeastern Congress onthe Holy Spirit.   ``I say let the reconciliation begin,'' the Rev. Karl Coke,pastor of Garr Memorial Church in Charlotte, told the 2,000participants at a service Sunday at Owens Auditorium.   ``I don't consider this risky,'' Coke told the Bakkers. ``Ithrew my reputation away when I walked into this room and sat withyou.''   Bakker grabbed Coke in a long embrace, then fell to his kneesonstage. Worshipers pressed forward with cameras to encircle thePentecostal preacher who built and lost the PTL ministry and itsHeritage USA theme park in a sex and money scandal.   ``Body of Christ, have you sinned against Jim Bakker?'' Cokeasked the audience.   ``Yes,'' hundreds shouted back.   ``Has Jim Bakker sinned against you?'' Coke continued.   ``Yes,'' the crowd replied.   ``Do you forgive him?''   The ``yes'' was drowned out by applause.   Coke put the next questions to Bakker.   ``Have you sinned against the body of Christ?'' he asked.   ``Yes,'' Bakker said.   ``Will you ask them to forgive you?''   ``Yes,'' Bakker replied tearfully.   ``Seventeen years ago, I came to this auditorium for the firsttime,'' Bakker said. ``The first time I ever ministered in thiscity was in this room. People rallied and built a network that wentaround the world.   ``I love you, and I have sinned, and I ask you to forgive me.''   Bakker said he had spent the past year reading the Bible. Hesaid he confessed his sins ``from childhood to this minute'' to aCatholic priest he described as a former alcoholic.   The Southeastern Congress on the Holy Spirit, which met Thursdaythrough Saturday at Heritage USA outside Charlotte at nearby FortMill, S.C., was a follow-up to a national meeting that drew 35,000charismatics to New Orleans last summer.   Organizers said Sunday they had raised $40,000 of the $50,000needed to pay expenses and plan the next event.</TEXT></DOC>
