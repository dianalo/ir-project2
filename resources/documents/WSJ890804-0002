But House members who opposed the administration's roundabout funding plan that wouldn't be included in the federal budget said the agreement could encounter a tough fight on the floor today. &quot;There were a lot of members who told me they wouldn't favor the plan if it's not on budget,&quot; said Rep. Bruce Vento (D., Minn.). Added Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio): &quot;It's going to be a tough sell.&quot;    The fight over the complicated financing has loomed as a huge tug-of-war ever since the bill was proposed in February. The president's plan, backed by the Senate, would raise $50 billion through industry bonds to close or merge sick Sandamp;Ls. It would cost $5 billion more than the original House plan over 30 years, but wouldn't increase the budget deficit and would preserve the appearance that statutory deficit-reduction goals were being met. The House's on-budget plan would be less costly, but would add to official deficit calculations and would require a waiver from the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.    In late-night negotiations between lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, conferees narrowly approved a plan that would place $20 billion of spending on the fiscal 1989 budget. The remaining $30 billion would be raised over two years through industry bonds, which wouldn't be counted as part of the budget.    Last week, House and Senate negotiators settled on the House financing plan. But when the House-Senate compromise was taken up on the House floor yesterday, a letter from President Bush was waiting. &quot;If the conference report is presented to me in its current form,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I will veto the bill.&quot;    Despite the threat, the House approved the original conference agreement by a vote of 221-199. But the legislation was derailed when it moved to the Senate last night. As he had long threatened, Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) raised a procedural obstacle to the House plan. Although senators voted 54-46 in favor of waiving Gramm-Rudman, the effort failed because the law requires at least 60 votes to waive the law's provisions.    &quot;The bailout under the best plan is going to be very costly and painful to the taxpayer,&quot; Sen. Gramm said. &quot;If we are going to let fiscal restraint get killed in process, then I think the costs will be much greater.&quot;    The Senate action bounced the bill back to conference. In often tense negotiations late last night, Secretary Brady finally conceded that the administration could live with $20 billion on the federal budget in the current fiscal year. Because the spending comes after Gramm-Rudman's deadline for calculating this year's deficit, a waiver won't be required.    But the support for the compromise was lukewarm. Following its approval by House negotiators on a 26-22 vote, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowksi (D., Ill.) said he hadn't decided which way he would vote on the bill. However, Congress is scheduled to begin a one-month recess after today's session and is unlikely to leave the emergency bill unfinished.    Faced with such a deadline, the administration altered its position significantly, too. In recent months, Mr. Brady had flatly rejected a similar proposal to take advantage of the Gramm-Rudman loophole in fiscal 1989. The administration has been loath to set a precedent of a granting $50 billion waiver from Gramm-Rudman, which Mr. Bush said in his letter, &quot;represents the only available institutional requirement for fiscal discipline.&quot;    In recent days, the administration has searched for ways to compromise on the financing for the landmark bill, which would close or merge several hundred insolvent Sandamp;Ls. The bill also would stiffen accounting and capital standards for Sandamp;Ls and put thrift regulators under the supervision of the Treasury.    Many in Congress were annoyed that Mr. Bush would threaten to kill or delay legislation he had called an &quot;emergency&quot; when it was proposed in February, and especially after most of his major provisions were preserved. &quot;The administration got at least 90% of what it wanted in this bill,&quot; said Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio).    But the two financing plans didn't easily lend themselves to a compromise. In the negotiations a week ago, several compromises were half-heartedly considered, and ultimately abandoned. Most would have included half the spending on the federal budget, and half off the budget using industry bonds.    &quot;Under the circumstances,&quot; Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) said late last night, &quot;I think this is a good compromise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
