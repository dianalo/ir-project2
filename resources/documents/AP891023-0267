Earnings were down at Exxon Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co.,Atlantic Richfield Co., and Ashland Oil Inc. reported a net loss.Occidental Petroleum Corp. said earnings rose slightly. AmeradaHess Corp., bucking the trend, said earnings more than doubled.   Analysts said higher worldwide crude oil prices partly offsetweaker refining margins due to a fall in gasoline prices.
