Now that mechanism is coming under fire.    Last week, Target Stores, a discount department-store chain, was targeted with a class-action lawsuit in Alameda County, Calif., superior court, challenging its psychological-testing practices for potential employees. The suit, believed to be the first such filing in the state and one of perhaps a handful nationally, alleges that the test violates privacy protections guaranteed in the California constitution, among other laws.    To critics, &quot;personality inventory tests,&quot; as they are called by personnel professionals, pose an unwarranted threat to worker rights, and offer little insight into future job performance. Target's 700-question test, for instance, contains such queries as &quot;I believe in the second coming of Christ&quot; and &quot;I have had no difficulty starting or holding my urine.&quot;    But a spokesman for Target, a division of Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., defended the tests, used for employees in sensitive posts, mainly security guards. &quot;We want to make sure people in very difficult jobs can conduct their jobs with respect and courtesy,&quot; he said, adding that psychologists generally evaluate such tests based on an applicant's overall pattern of responses rather than an answer to a particular question.    Some labor experts said the chances of such a suit succeeding in California were aided because the state's courts tend to construe the privacy clause broadly.    But Victor Schachter, a San Francisco labor lawyer, says the state's supreme court hasn't definitively decided the key question of to what extent, if at all, such protections extend to the private sector. ---    FEDERAL MARSHALS have found nearly 60,000 concealed weapons at courthouses in the past four years.    The U.S. Marshals Service says increased security at federal courthouses nationwide has uncovered everything from homemade knives and hatchets to handguns and detonating devices.    &quot;We are getting a more violent type of criminal through the courts than we have in the past,&quot; says U.S. Marshal Tom Rapone, in Philadelphia, where courthouse security guards have confiscated 5,643 weapons in the past four years.    The reason, says Mr. Rapone, is drugs.    According to the marshals service, threats against the &quot;judicial family&quot; are at an all time high. Of the 213 threats recorded last year nationwide, federal judges received the most (69%), followed by assistant federal prosecutors (15%), federal magistrates (9%) and U.S. attorneys, (3%).    Nearly half of the threats come through the mail. Only 1% of the threats were physical, according to the Marshals Service.    In Philadelphia, security guards have found detonating devices, pipe bombs, hatchets, motorcycle chains with leather handles and guns, including a .22-caliber, two-shot Derringer disguised as a beeper.    The most unusual weapon? A crucifix worn as a medallion that flipped open into a stiletto with a five-inch blade.    ---   &quot;L.A. LAW&quot; legal adviser fights off scripts that distort reality.    Nonetheless, in the interest of drama and excitement, reality often ends up on the cutting-room floor. One show, for example, included gunfire in a law firm conference room. In another, there was a smoke bomb thrown into the middle of a deposition taking.    &quot;In over 1,000 depositions, I've never seen a smoke bomb,&quot; says the show's legal adviser Charles Rosenberg, a Los Angeles lawyer. Mr. Rosenberg discussed his unusual job last week at the Judicial Conference of the Second Circuit, held in Bolton Landing, N.Y.    Mr. Rosenberg did have some victories to note. For example, when the show wanted to put a defense attorney into a scene in which a client was testifying before a grand jury, Mr. Rosenberg objected. Lawyers aren't allowed in the grand jury room, so the scene was scratched.    Still, Mr. Rosenberg conceded, &quot;We do glamorize the legal world. If you showed what it's really like, people wouldn't watch the show. . . . After all, a typical trial is like a stretch of interstate highway in Kansas.&quot;    For the purists among the viewers, Mr. Rosenberg said, a scene that stretches credulity will often be preceded by the one character saying, &quot;I know it's pretty unusual but what we're going to do is . . . .&quot;    ---   SOVIET LAWYERS ARRIVE: Seventeen lawyers from the Soviet Union have come to the U.S. to gain some hands-on experience in the U.S. legal system as part of a new work-study program sponsored by the American Bar Association. The just-arrived Soviet group includes an entertainment lawyer interested in learning how to negotiate recording contracts for Soviet rock musicians, several legal scholars and a local prosecutor. Most of the 17 Soviet lawyers will spend time working at various U.S. law firms, including New York's White andamp; Case, Haight, Gardner, Poor andamp; Havens and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen andamp; Hamilton; and Washington's Arnold andamp; Porter. Others will spend time at U.S. law schools and government offices. A spokesman for the ABA says the program &quot;marks a furtherance of the good will generated by glasnost and the warming of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.&quot;    ---   ONE PORN PLAZA: All the furniture hadn't yet been moved into Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore's new offices at Manhattan's Worldwide Plaza before the jokes began. &quot;One Porn Plaza,&quot; occupants quickly dubbed the block-long complex of business offices, stores, townhouses and movie theaters between 49th and 50th streets on Eighth Avenue. Cravath's 300 lawyers and more than 900 support staffers took most of last month to move into 13 floors of their new 49-story office tower -- double the space of their old Wall Street-area digs. The law firm has its own entrance on Eighth Avenue, an emergency day-care center and wooden and marble walls. &quot;It's a really fabulous space,&quot; chirped managing partner John W. White. Although the building is located several blocks from the Times Square's porno district, the large marquee of a pornographic-movie house, the Adonis Theatre, looms prominently one block north. By year end, however, the theater will be bought and demolished as part of the lease agreement with Cravath, says landlord and developer William Zeckendorf. Cravath's top partners hope that Worldwide Plaza's unsavory nickname will fall with it. </TEXT></DOC>
