Now, withHungary declaring itself a democracy and Moscow coping with its owninternal turmoil, the Kremlin is deafeningly quiet.   With Poland and East Germany also absorbed in their ownturbulent politics, it has been left to Hungary's orthodoxneighbors, Czechoslovakia and Romania, to sound the communist alarmabout the historic events in Budapest.   Their concern is compounded by worries about the reaction oftheir own large ethnic Hungarian minorities, who were able tofollow commemorations of the 1956 Hungarian uprising on liveHungarian television broadcasts Monday.   A ``political coup d'etat,'' thundered the Communist Party dailyPravda in Slovakia on Monday, commenting on a historicparliamentary session in Budapest that rewrote the Hungarianconstitution to embrace democracy and pave the way for freeelections next year.   Romania so far has been silent about that session and Monday'srallies, in which more than 100,000 Hungarians cheered theproclamation of a democratic republic on the 33rd anniversary oftheir popular uprising.   But President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, perhaps thestaunchest communist ideologue in the East bloc, last weekdenounced Hungary's path. He pledged Romania would never follow thesame course toward a free market.   At odds with Budapest for years over charges that Romania isharassing its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, Ceausescu is bound tobe further unsettled by the strident demands for democracy voicedin Budapest on Monday.   A unique race in central Europe, with no linguistic bonds toneighboring Slavs and Germans, Hungarians have a tradition ofmaneuvering for the maximum freedom despite dominance by strongerneighbors.   This history has also made them fiercely nationalistic, a pridethat has not died in the extensive former Hungarian territories nowincorporated in Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia.   Ceausescu's tough rule has so far kept ethnic Hungarianyearnings for more freedom from combining with widespreaddiscontent at food and fuel shortages to ignite major outbreaks ofunrest such as that which occurred in the Transylvanian city ofBrasov in November 1987, when 10,000 angry workers took to thestreets in protest.   While Czechoslovakia and Romania bristle, the Soviet Union turnsthe other cheek. Moscow's reticence toward the dramatic changes inHungary confirm that President Mikhail Gorbachev, plagued bystrikes and ethnic unrest at home, is sticking to his policy ofnon-interference in eastern Europe.   Referring to Hungary's ruling Communist Party's decision todisband and form a Socialist Party that espouses democratic ideals,Soviet East European expert Oleg Bogomolov wrote in the Oct. 15edition of the weekly Moscow News, ``Obviously, difficulties lieahead. As it appears, the new party will be sailing in stormy andhazardous waters.''   Bogomolov is credited with helping forge the new Soviet attitudetoward its allies. In his commentary, he insisted on only onepoint: that Hungarians ``mustn't question the existence of theWarsaw Pact and their contacts'' within the Soviet trading bloc.   Similar assurances from Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa inPoland helped lead to the August nomination of non-communist PrimeMinister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.   Hungary's reform-minded leaders hope to stave off the resoundingdefeat suffered by the Polish Communists in June elections,adopting a program of radical economic and political change in aneffort to win popular support.   However, the pace of change in Hungary is so swift that opinionpolls indicate its current leaders will at best be only partners ina coalition government after elections.   The Soviets, and the rest of eastern Europe, will then have todeal with the implications of another ouster of communism throughthe ballot box.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Alison Smale, chief of the Vienna bureau of TheAssociated Press, has reported on Soviet bloc affairs from Germany,Moscow and Eastern Europe since 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
