Spokesman Richard Boucher disclosed the talks Friday, saying theUnited States urged Syria to ``take action'' against the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command and other``terrorist groups.''   Boucher said the talks with Syria about links to terroristgroups began before the Pan Am bombing on Dec. 21, 1988 that killed270 people.   The PFL-GC has been named in news reports as a prime suspect inthe bombing, but Boucher did not confirm whether any specific groupwas suspected of the bombing.   Several terrorist groups operate with Syria's support in thecountry as well as in areas of neighboring Lebanon under Syriancontrol, Boucher said.   ``The United States is not satisfied with the Syrian response todate,'' the spokesman said. ``We will continue to press ourconcerns.''   A seven-member presidential commission decided on Thursday tolook into Pan Am's allegation that 36 hours before the explosionover Lockerbie, Scotland, the Israeli intelligence agency warnedU.S. authorities of a possible terrorist attack.   The commission also agreed to investigate Pan Am's contentionthat West German authorities had reported ``suspicious activities''at the Frankfurt airport within 90 minutes of the flight.   Besides Syria, Boucher said discussions were held with ``othercountries which may have information about terrorist groups.'' Hedid not name the countries.   He said the United States ``has repeatedly expressed concern,both publicly and privately, about terrorist groups supported bySyria, including the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command. On numerous occasions we have askedSyria to take action against these groups, both inside Syria and inSyria-controlled areas of Lebanon.''   Meanwhile, the spokesman for a Lebanese-American organizationsaid nearly 15,000 acres of the Bekaa Valley, which is under Syriancontrol, are being used to produce heroin.   ``They are doing this with the full knowledge of the U.S.government,'' said Joseph L. Boohaker, spokesman for the NationalAlliance of Lebanese Americans.   He said Syria and Colombia were cooperating in drug trafficking.He showed television film of what he said was a meeting between aSyrian representative and Pablo Escobar, an alleged Colombian drugsmuggler wanted by the United States, outside a hotel in Larnaca,Cyprus.   The State Department said Friday night: ``We have no knowledgeof links between Syria and the Colombian `Medellin Cartel.'''   Also Friday, Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, said an insuranceinvestigator's report convinced him the CIA had been tipped inadvance that terrorists might attempt to blow up Pan Am's plane,but remained silent. He asserted the report, which he did notrelease, concludes the CIA was ``covering up a drug run,''protecting the terrorists' Frankfurt-to-New York heroin route inexchange for contacts that might lead to the release of Americanhostages.   The CIA immediately denied Traficant's charges and labeled thereport ``nonsense.''</TEXT></DOC>
