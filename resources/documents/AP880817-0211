The company's plans were outlined in a filing required by theSEC to outline any company actions that might affect stockholders,according to Bill Beckham, a Unisys spokesman.   The $9.2 million contract involves administrative and computerwork for the Army Information Systems Command at Ft. Huachuca,Ariz. The case is not related to the ongoing Pentagon briberyinvestigation, in which Unisys also has been mentioned, although nocharges have been filed.   The Unisys-Army probe is being conducted by the U.S. attorney'soffice in Tucson, Ariz., and is one of three federalinvestigations, outside of the Pentagon case, made public in a July19 letter from Michael Blumenthal, chairman of Unisys, to employees.   Bluementhal's letter said the three other investigations wereunder way before the November, 1986 merger between the Sperry Corp.and Burroughs, which created Unisys. The Ft. Huachuca contractinvolves a former Sperry office in Sierra Vista, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
