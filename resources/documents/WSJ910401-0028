United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier Corp. unit is expectedto announce within weeks the first cooling system based on an1816 design by the Scottish clergyman and inventor RobertStirling. Others have produced prototypes in anticipation ofmarketing their own Stirling engines.</LP><TEXT>   Called a &quot;cryogenic cooler,&quot; Carrier's compact device cancool to minus 161 degrees Celsius, or minus 321 degreesFahrenheit, and is designed to supercool components of largecomputers, medical diagnostic machines and magneticallylevitating trains, said Gerald Robertson, director of advanceelectronics cooling.   The move by Carrier, which sees a $100 million market forits device in five years, gives a major boost to new Stirlingdesigns being developed for household refrigerators and airconditioners. Researchers say the technology is a promisingalternative to current systems that employchlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as coolants. These chemicalsare suspected of destroying the Earth's protective ozonelayer and are to go out of production by the year 2000according to an international treaty.   The original Stirling engine wasn't developed as a coolingdevice but as a source of mechanical power. Heat applied toone end of the engine's gas-filled cylinder sends a piston tothe other end. It competed with the steam engine, before bothwere displaced by the internal combustion engine early inthis century. But it's the Stirling's ability to reverse theprocess -- by applying power to the piston and causing thegas within the cylinder to absorb heat -- that intrigues therefrigeration crowd.   Besides Carrier, which is working with Stirling TechnologyCo. of Richland, Wash., other companies developing Stirlingengines include: General Electric Co., which has helpeddevelop a Stirling engine with Sunpower Inc. of Athens, Ohio;Cryodynamics Inc. of Mountainside, N.J., and Japan's KawasakiHeavy Industries Ltd.   &quot;Stirling could replace {the machinery} in existingrefrigerators,&quot; says Warren Bessler, a mechanical engineer atGE's research and development center in Schenectady, N.Y.   Part of Stirling's promise is that it eliminates the needfor CFCs, made of chlorine, fluorine and carbon andintroduced by Du Pont Co. in 1931 under the name Freon. Usedin $30 billion of cooling gear sold annually, they have thevirtue of being non-corrosive and non-explosive.   In the typical cooling cycle, CFC gas is compressed to aliquid, then pumped into a pipe and allowed to evaporate. Asit evaporates, it absorbs heat from the space to be cooledaround the pipe. The gas returns to the compressor andrepeats the cycle.   Prompting the search for alternative technologies is thehigh corrosiveness and low efficiency of most CFCsubstitutes. Some are less harmful than CFCs, but they alsorisk being regulated or banned in the future. While heliumused in the Stirling engine is inert and nontoxic, theenormous pressure and very low temperature required toliquefy it render it impractical in existing refrigeration.   In the Stirling engine, helium remains a gas. The Sunpowerprototype consists of a hermetically sealed casing in which apiston moves back and forth in helium. The piston firstcompresses the gas and sends it to another section of thecasing, where it's allowed to expand and in the processabsorbs heat from its surroundings. The expanded gas thenmoves back to the compression side of the piston and thecycle repeats, with the piston constantly &quot;pumping&quot; heat outof a confined area.   The idea of using the Stirling engine as a &quot;heat pump&quot; wasfirst suggested by a British inventor in 1873. But the pistonhad to be connected to a motor and the gas in the cylinderwould leak out through the seals around the piston rod. Thatproblem was solved by William Beale, Sunpower's founder, who,in the early 1960s, developed the hermetically sealed casingin which a magnet is embedded in the piston, which is movedremotely by an unattached motor.   &quot;We have achieved efficiency that's very comparable to thecurrent refrigerators,&quot; says David Berchowitz, Sunpower'sdesign engineer. He says there's still room for improvement,which &quot;would make Stirling technology more efficient&quot; thanconventional refrigerators. He says that for the same amountof electricity, the Stirling system can lower temperature tominus 50 degrees Celsius compared with minus 26 degrees forthe current refrigerators.   While GE's Mr. Bessler is encouraged by Stirling'spotential, particularly by Sunpower's system, he doesn't seeany rush yet to commercialize the technology for householduse. &quot;Theoretically, Stirling is more efficient than thepresent refrigerators, but there is a big gap between theoryand hardware. A refrigerator needs to last ten years or morewithout maintenance. We need to convince ourselves thatStirling can last that long,&quot; he says.   Moreover, says Mr. Bessler, current refrigerators arebecoming more efficient, and chemical companies are spendinghuge sums to replace CFCs with safe and efficientsubstitutes. &quot;If I was using my money, I would say Stirlingis year 2000 type of technology.&quot;   Working in Stirling's favor are efforts by Cummins EngineCo., Columbus, Ind., and the German engineering concernMachinen Fabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg AG, among others, todevelop it as a power source. Stirling engines also powersome U.S. satellites, and improvements made on the powergenerating side will benefit the engine's cooling side.   Sunpower's Mr. Berchowitz says his company is currentlystudying potential partnerships and licensing agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
