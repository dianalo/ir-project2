Background</ITAG>It is the Departamentof Defense policy that contractors shall provide allfacilities and materials required for performing Government contracts.In the case of support service contracts performed on installations (particularlythose subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 (FAR Subpart 7.3), the installationhas normally invested in existing facilities which, if not provided tocontractors, could result in additional expenditures to the Government.The procedures implemented by this deviation permit the Government to obtainthe maximum use of existing Government property. The deviation procedureswill also permit the Government to reduce the amount of Government propertyfurnished to contractors as directed by the Under Secretary of Defense(Acquisition). Contracts will be closely monitored to ensure that the invoicesare in accordance with proposals. That is, for fixed-price contracts anyreplacement item cost is amortized in accordance with FAR Part 31 costprinciples and the allocable portion included in the fixed price for eachappropriate year. For cost-type contracts the cost must be amortized inaccordance with FAR Part 31 cost principles and the allocable portion shownappropriately. These costs are not to be charged as direct line item costs.At the end of the two-year test period, the Army will report to the DARCouncil such results as: contractor reaction; problems with proposal evaluationsor cost comparisons; impact on contract service support and problems withfollow-on contracts.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.
