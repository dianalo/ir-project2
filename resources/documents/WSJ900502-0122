They'relooking for a lot more than family benefits.   That's the message from two new surveys, which saymanagerial women who quit tend to do so not because of familyobligations, but because they feel blocked from advancement.The studies also show that women are more willing than men tothrow corporate loyalty to the wind if they aren't gettingadequate opportunities for growth and job satisfaction.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, some management specialists warn that unlesscompanies begin accommodating women's desire for promotionsand respect, employers could risk increasing the already highrate of turnover among female professionals. Right now, manycompanies are merely emphasizing family issues, such asmaternity leave and day care, to attract and retain women.   &quot;While day care and family-oriented benefits areimportant, they're not the reason women are leaving,&quot; saysVicki Tashjian, vice president of Wick andamp; Co., a Wilmington,Del., consulting firm. A recent study by Wick showed that of110 male and female professionals from Fortune 500 companiesin the Northeast, 73% of the women who had left jobs quit towork for other companies. Another 13% began their ownbusinesses and 7% were looking for new jobs. Only 7% left togo home.   &quot;The reasons I left had nothing to do with family,&quot; saysGloria Webster, who used to be a financial analyst for amultinational chemical corporation. In her 14 years there,Ms. Webster says, she won regular promotions, yet could neverbreak into management. Though she had supporters and goodtraining opportunities, she says she finally &quot;hit what I feltwas my glass ceiling,&quot; feeling blocked as a woman by &quot;peoplewho didn't want me to succeed in any way.&quot;   Now, the 44-year-old mother of one is manager of corporatecommunications for a commercial explosives business, whereemployees &quot;sink or swim on their own merits,&quot; she says. &quot;It'sa challenge every day, and I thrive on it.&quot;   A separate study by Opinion Research Corp., Princeton,N.J., echoes the same sentiment. Data gathered on more than26,500 male and female managers, supervisors andprofessionals at seven big service and manufacturingcorporations revealed that women managers were more likelythan men to say they intend to leave their company within thenext year. Women also were more dissatisfied than men withtheir career development. &quot;Compared to male managers, femalemanagers perceive that they have fewer opportunities foradvancement and less chance of achieving their careerobjectives in their organizations,&quot; the study concluded.   Two-thirds of the women in the Wick study had children,but when asked if there was anything going on in theirpersonal lives influencing their decisions to quit, womenmentioned children only 9% of the time. By contrast, men inthe study, 90% of whom had offspring, answered children 26%of the time.   &quot;Women feel they do pay a pretty steep price&quot; in eitherchoosing between family and career or balancing the two, saysMs. Tashjian. Those who stick with their careers seem to feel&quot;they're just giving up too much not to be getting theopportunity for work that's really meaningful,&quot; she says.   That tolerance threshold seems lower with women than withmen. In the Wick study, 77% of the men said it was &quot;highlylikely&quot; they would remain with their company while just 35%of the women said so. The study speculates that dissatisfiedmen are more likely to hang on because they are trapped intraditional notions about staying with one company.   &quot;Men still seem to have much more corporate loyalty,&quot; saysMs. Tashjian, whereas &quot;women are always thinking aboutleaving,&quot; even if they are supporting families. She says the&quot;invisible hard choices&quot; women must make usually rear up in awoman's early to mid-30s, the &quot;period of peril&quot; whendissatisfied women are most likely to leave a job.   The Opinion Research survey showed that female managersare more likely to have job turnover than male managers nomatter what their age. Even women over 40 -- a time when mostwomen are beyond childbearing years and have older, moreself-sufficient children -- are more likely to leave jobsthan their male counterparts.   &quot;If {women} were leaving because of small children, thenwe'd see turnover drop among women over 40, we think. But wedon't see that,&quot; says Ellen M. Saxon, a research consultantat Opinion Research. This study, too, found that men reportmore conflict between work and family than women. &quot;Women maybe leaving more due to the fact that they lack opportunity toget ahead . . . rather than family and personal obligations,&quot;Ms. Saxon believes.   Both sets of research challenge the wisdom of what somederisively call a &quot;mommy track&quot; for women. The worlds ofbusiness and women collided over this issue last year afterFelice Schwartz, president of Catalyst, a New York group thatspecializes in women-in-business issues, argued in a HarvardBusiness Review article that women cost more than men toemploy due to family-caused turnover and career interruptionsand so should be separated into &quot;career primary&quot; and &quot;careerand family oriented&quot; tracks to better retain and accommodateboth types.   &quot;Not one of the women in our study mentioned that she wasleaving to obtain better benefits such as maternity leave orday-care assistance,&quot; says Wick's Ms. Tashjian. She goes sofar as to say corporate &quot;fixation&quot; on these family detailscan detract from larger issues of women's advancement.   Margaret Evans, a senior account director and board memberof BBDO, the New York advertising agency, says she has workedthere 11 years not because of any family benefits but becauseshe has been challenged by an array of interestingassignments and rewarded with promotions. But the mother oftwo toddlers says she would think &quot;very seriously aboutleaving&quot; if she didn't enjoy her work.   One company attempting to respond to professional women'sneeds is Chubb andamp; Son Inc. At the Warren, N.J., insurer, womenhave been half of entry-level professionals hired during thepast eight years. Though progress had been made, most of themare still bunched up in the middle ranks with only a fewbursting out of the &quot;pipeline&quot; into more senior positions.&quot;Something is happening in that 10-to 12-year developmentprocess where the playing field gets less level,&quot; says DavidFowler, Chubb's senior vice president and managing director,who has worked with Wick to remedy that problem.   One strategy, Mr. Fowler says, is holding managersaccountable for how they are advancing women and minoritiesand publishing the results in quarterly &quot;at-bat reports,&quot;which will affect bonuses. &quot;Those branch managers who fill 30jobs with white males bat zero, and those who fill a bunchwith women and minorities get hits,&quot; he says, adding thatfinancial incentive is &quot;what will make people behavedifferently.&quot;   As for corporate America's poor track record in nurturingwomen's advancement, Mr. Fowler blames a complex web ofreasons, including stereotyping by male managers who are morecomfortable working with other men, and a lack ofassertiveness by women on &quot;managing the political process oftheir career development.&quot; (In a recent survey by Catalyst,79% of Fortune 500 chief executive officers conceded thereare identifiable barriers to women getting to the top.)   If treatment of women managers continues as it is into the1990s, Mr. Fowler says, women will become angry, some evenbringing legal action, and some will just plain quit. In theend, he says, corporations will have &quot;missed opportunities tohire very talented ones.&quot;   ---                    Is It Worth Staying?
