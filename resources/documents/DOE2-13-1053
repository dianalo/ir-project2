With the introduction of new, input responsivecereal cultivars, land that once grew pulses has gone to cereal crops.This has improved the quantity of food and the incomes of farmers, buthas had an undesirable impact on food quality. In response, breedersfrom 27 countries took the initiative, with the support of the JointFAO/IAEA Division, to develop by mutation induction improved cultivarsof grain legumes for higher intensity farming, as well as for persistingmarginal conditions. Efforts were focused on plant architecture, floweringhabit, maturity time, the ratios between yield contributing factors anddisease problems. Many valuable breeding lines are now available andapproximately one hundred varieties have already been released. Recently,some emphasis was placed on long term joint efforts by soil microbiologists,plant physiologists and plant breeders to make symbiotic nitrogen fixationof grain legumes more economically viable. Induced mutations are expectedto play a key role in these efforts. (author). 165 refs, 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
