(Kamine),and Beta South Glens Falls Inc. (Beta). Kamine is an affiliate of KamineEngineering and Mechanical Contracting Co., Inc. (KEMCO), a New Jerseycorporation with its principal place of business in East Union, New Jersey.Beta is a wholly owned subsidiary of Besicorp Group, Inc. (Besicorp), aNew York corporation with its principal place of business in Kingston,New York. KEMCO and Besicorp, individually and jointly, are energy projectdevelopers and have been owners and operators of natural gas cogenerationfacilities since 1985. KEMCO and/or Besicorp (as affiliates) currentlyoperate four cogeneration facilities in New York and New Jersey and haveseveral other cogeneration facilities in various stages of planning orconstruction.According to Applicant, the new cogeneration facility is expected to becompleted and in commercial operation by May 1, 1991. If the facility isnot operational until after May 1, 1991, the gas subject to the Agreementwill be sold in Canadian markets until facility operations begin. Applicantstates the gas will be used to fuel a new combined-cycle cogeneration facilityto be owned by Applicant and constructed on premises leased from JamesRiver II Corporation (James River), an affiliate of James River Corporationof Virginia, at the James River paper mill near South Glens Falls, JeffersonCounty, New York. The plant has been certified as a ``qualifying facility''under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The steamwill be sold to the James River paper mill and the electricity will besold to Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (Niagara Mohawk).Applicant will purchase the gas from Renaissance Energy Ltd. (Renaissance),pursuant to a natural gas purchase agreement executed May 9, 1989, andenclosed as an exhibit with the application. The agreement states thatthe Applicant will pay Renaissance for gas a minimum Base Price of $1.45per MMBtu U.S. This base price is adjusted each quarter to reflect thepercentage change in value of an index comprised of: (1) A 50% weightingreflecting the 100% load factor rate published by Consolidated NaturalGas (CNG), (2) a 25% weighting reflecting the price of No. 2 fuel, and(3) a 25% weighting reflecting the average price of spot gas deliveredto five major pipelines compared to the value of the index on December1, 1988. The adjusted base price includes commodity costs, royalties, fuel,shrinkage, transportation charges, and costs of permits. This base pricewill be adjusted annually to reflect the percentage increase in the averageelectric unit price paid by Niagara Mohawk for electricity generated bythe cogeneration facility, subject to a maximum of $2.40 per MMBtu in thefirst contract year. The base price and the composition of the index willbe renegotiated in the month preceding the date of first delivery and priorto the expiration of the fifth and tenth contract years. If Applicant andRenaissance cannot agree on such renegotiated base price or compositionof the index, either party may terminate this agreement upon proper notice.Applicant supplemented its application with a November 6, 1989, filingthat details the transportation arrangements made for the proposed importusing existing facilities, lists the approximate costs of the transportationcomponents, and includes copies of the TransCanada PipeLines (TCPL) transportationagreement and tariffs. Applicant indicates that Renaissance will deliverthe natural gas through the pipeline facilities of the NOVA Corporation.The Applicant will take title to the gas in Canada and transport the gasthrough the facilities of TCPL to an existing interconnection with GreatLakes Gas Transmission (Great Lakes). Great Lakes will transport the gasto ANR Pipeline Company (ANR). ANR will transport the gas to the NiagaraMohawk distribution system which will transport the gas to the existinginterconnect with Texas Gas Pipeline Co. (Texas Gas) which will transportit to CNG. CNG will transport the gas to the cogeneration facility. Theapproximate costs of the U.S. transportation components total $1.60 perMcf. According to Applicant, transportation is on an interruptible basisthrough the systems of Great Lakes, ANR, Texas Gas, and CNG.Applicant states that all the natural gas imported under its requestedauthorization will be used to fuel the new cogeneration facility. Underanticipated normal operating conditions, the cogenerating facility willproduce an average of about 14,200 Mcf per day. Applicant asserts thatits request for authority to import up to 104 Bcf per year is necessaryto meet the facility's fuel needs, allow for transportation shrinkage,and provide a reasonable margin for any unforeseen exigency.In support of its application, Applicant states that the imported gas willprovide a reliable, long-term, secure supply of competitively priced gasto the new cogeneration facility. According to the Applicant, the agreement'sprice provisions provide for market-responsive pricing subject to quarterlyadjustments. Moreover, the Applicant states, it is not subject to a take-or-payobligation; instead, the agreement provides for mutual quantity reductionoptions in the even of specified degrees of reduced performance by eitherparty. At the same time, Applicant avers, its electric purchase contractsrequire Niagara Mohawk to purchase all generated electric power, with nocurtailment or interruption provisions except for specific operationalreasons. Similarly, the Applicant states, James River has contracted topurchase all of its net steam requirement from the new cogeneration facility.With regard to security of supply, the agreement provides for the dedicationof specific reserves from a portion of Renaissance's reserve base of 20gas fields. For these reasons, the Applicant maintains that the proposedimport is consistent with the public interest. Applicant filed a Certification of Compliance with the coal capabilityrequirement for proposed new electric powerplants pursuant to the Powerplantand Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) (10 U.S.C. 3801 <T3>et seq.</T3>, as amended; 53 FR 35544, September 14, 1988). The decision on Applicant's application for import authority will be madeconsistent with the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under which thecompetitiveness of an import arrangement in the markets served is the primaryconsideration in determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR6684, February 22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered in makinga public interest determination include need for gas, security of the long-termsupply, and any relevant issues that may be unique to cogeneration facilities.Parties that may oppose this application should comment in their responseson the issues of competitiveness, need for the gas, and security of supplyas set forth in the policy guidelines. The applicant asserts that thisimport arrangement is in the public interest because it is competitiveand its gas source will be secure. Parties opposing the import arrangementbear the burden of overcoming these assertions. All parties should be aware that if the requested import is approved, theauthorization would be conditioned on the filing of quarterly reports indicatingvolumes imported and the purchase price. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance </ITAG>Under section D of the DOE guidelines for compliance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>, actions that grant or deny import authorizations whereno new gas transmission facilities are needed but where new ancillary facilitiesare to be constructed, such as a cogeneration facility, would normallyrequire the preparation of an environment assessment (EA), because theyinvolve ``minor new construction'' (54 FR 12474, March 27, 1989). However,we believe that preparation of an EA to approve or disapprove this applicationis unnecessary, and compliance with NEPA for the proposed action can beachieved by invoking two categorical exclusions in the DOE NEPA guidelines(52 FR 47622, December 15, 1987). The environmental impacts of constructing and operating new cogenerationfacilities have been addressed on numerous occasions by the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) in conjunction with processing exemption petitionsunder the FUA, and as a result, such actions have been granted a categoricalexclusion from further NEPA review (52 FR 47670, December 15, 1987). Thecogeneration facilities to be constructed in connection with these importapplications are identical to those facilities covered by the categoricalexclusion for FUA actions. Therefore, it is an appropriate applicationof another categorical exclusion contained in the DOE guidelines for ``actionsthat are substantially the same as other actions for which the environmentaleffects have already been assessed in a NEPA document and determined byDOE to be clearly insignificant and where such assessment is currentlyvalid'' (52 FR 47668, December 15, 1987) to extend the FUA categoricalexclusion for cogeneration facilities to the grant of an authorizationto import natural gas under the NGA which results in the construction andoperation of a cogeneration facility. A categorical exclusion raises a rebuttable presumption that the Federalaction will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Unless it appears during the proceedings on this import application thatthe grant or denial of authorization will significantly affect the qualityof the human environment, the Office of Fuels Programs expects that noadditional environmental review will be required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments.
