Dukakis also took a slap at the Reagan administration'santi-drug efforts, saying, ``There is nobody accountable. Thechairman of the committee is (Attorney General) Ed Meese. 'Nuffsaid.''   Bush, who wrapped up the Republican presidential nominationseveral weeks ago, was the featured speaker at a Drug EnforcementAdministration service in Washington honoring three officers killedin the line of duty.   ``By design, you don't get your pictures in the paper or sit atthe head table at testimonial dinners,'' he told his audience.``But everywhere I've gone in this country, I take time talkingabout the contribution you make.''   With the families of slain agents Paul S. Seema, George M.Montoya and Arthur L. Cash in attendance, Bush renewed his call for``increasing the certainty and the severity of punishment.''   ``I really do believe the death penalty is the answer,'' he saidto a standing ovation.   But Dukakis persisted in his opposition to the death penalty infielding questions at a meeting of broadcasting executives inBoston.   ``Have you seen any significant reduction in drug trafficking inthe states that have it? I don't,'' he said.   Earlier, Dukakis met briefly at the Statehouse with NatanSharansky, a Soviet emigre and a leading activist in efforts to winpermission for Jews to leave the Soviet Union.   Monday was his 25th wedding anniversary and Dukakis said hiswife, Kitty, was taking him out to dinner. ``That's my announcementfor today,'' Dukakis told the luncheon of broadcast executives.   Dukakis opposes the death penalty as a matter of principle, andBush is expected to attempt to make their difference over the issueinto an important part of his campaign. The vice president also hasspoken critically of Dukakis' reluctance to change a Massachusettsprison furlough program that permitted first degree murderers timeaway from their cells, even after one convict raped a woman whileon furlough.   ``I think the governor of Massachusetts owes the American peoplean explanation for why he supported this outrageous program....Whatdid he think about when he let first-degree murderers out onweekends,'' the vice president said recently.   The governor moved to counter some of Bush's criticism duringthe day, saying, ``I know of no responsible corrections program inthe country, with very few exceptions, that does not includefurloughs.''   He added that Ronald Reagan supported a furlough program whilegovernor of California.   Dukakis did not say so, but only a few states allow convictedmurderers out on furlough.   Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration, saying thepresident has a committee representing federal agencies as his drugtask force. He said he would appoint a czar with direct access tothe president.   The object of a Dukakis jab _ Meese _ shared the stage with Bushat the DEA ceremony in Washington. He praised Bush as ``the leaderin the administration ... in speaking out on behalf of the(anti-drug) law enforcement effort.''   Bush and Dukakis made their public appearances while DemocratJesse Jackson campaigned in Minnesota even though the primaryseason ended two weeks ago.   Jackson visited the drought-stricken southeastern Minnesota farmof Dale and Nancy Snesrud and called for a moratorium on farmforeclosures. He said farmers hurt by Reagan administrationeconomic and agricultural policies now have no economic cushion tohelp them through the drought.   Aides to Dukakis said the Massachusetts governor would meet withJackson on Tuesday in California.   Dukakis wound up the primary season with more than enoughdelegates to the Democratic National Convention to claim theparty's nomination. With public opinion polls indicating he holds alead over Bush, he told broadcast executives that the Democratshave ``an extraordinary opportunity to win and to win with visionand with strength.''   He said he hoped to bring some of his statehouse programs withhim to Washington if elected, but added, ``I also know that beingpresident is not being governor.''</TEXT></DOC>
