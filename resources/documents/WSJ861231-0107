LublinStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/31/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)ECONOMIC AND MONETARY INDICATORS (EMI) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government's main economic forecasting gauge spurted 1.2% in November, the sharpest rise since January 1985, but several analysts suggested the surge may mask some weakness ahead.    The increase in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators followed a revised 0.5% gain in October. The index rose 1.3% in January 1985. The department previously reported a 0.6% rise for October.    Separately, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes slipped 2.2% in November to their second-lowest level this year. But several economists expect the tempo, aided by lower mortgage rates, to quicken slightly over the next six months.    For the second month in a row, the increase in the index of leading economic indicators partly stemmed from a large rise in prices for sensitive materials, a category that includes a wide range of market-sensitive commodities. Excluding this category, the index increased 0.7%. Department officials said prices rose substantially last month for cattle hides, iron and steel scrap, aluminum scrap and lumber.    Several economists suggested that the strong November rise in the index partly reflected a burst of activity designed to beat tax-law changes that take effect in 1987, rather than a fundamental strengthening of the economy. The tax law, among other changes, repeals the sales tax deduction and establishes less-favorable depreciation schedules.    &quot;The economy is doing fine now because everybody is trying to beat the new tax law,&quot; said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. He predicted such activity will drop off once the new year begins, leading to a sharp economic slowdown in 1987's first quarter.    Sandra Shaber, an economist at Chase Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., called the Commerce Department report &quot;generally good news&quot; that should dispel fears of a recession. But she agreed that there has been &quot;a flurry of activity associated with beating the tax laws.&quot;    She also noted that increases in the index have resulted largely from financial indicators, such as the money supply and stock prices, for much of the year. &quot;This may put people to work on Wall Street, but it doesn't solve the problems in the rest of the country,&quot; she said.    The department confirmed in its latest report that beginning with next February's index, it will drop from its leading indicators a &quot;net business formation&quot; component. As previously reported, the department has decided that the category, which is designed to measure new business starts, has become unreliable. The indicator is calculated using new business incorporations and business failure data from Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. and information on telephone installations.    Feliks Tamm, chief of the department's statistical indicators division, said that the quality of the data on telephone installations has become less useful, partly as a result of telephone deregulation and the proliferation of new communications products.    The November rise in the index brought it to 182.5% of its 1967 average from 180.4% in October.    The department's index of coincident indicators, which tend to rise and fall with economic activity, rose 0.4% in November to 165.5% of its 1967 average, after falling 0.4% in October to 164.8%.    The index of lagging indicators, which tend to trail economic trends, fell 0.2% last month to 133.2% of its 1967 average after gaining 1.5% to 133.5% in October. The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, which some analysts believe signals turning points in the economy ahead of the leading index, rose to 1.24 from 1.23.    The department's housing report showed that sales of new single-family houses fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 661,000 last month, following a revised 7.8% drop in October. The department initially had put the October decline at 9.6%. Except in September, new-home sales have dropped every month since achieving the year's peak annual rate of 924,000 units last March.    The increase in housing prices didn't ease in November despite the sales decline and builders' higher inventory of unsold new homes. The average price for new homes advanced 3.8% to $116,800, matching an 11-year record set in July, and up from a revised $112,500 in October, the report said. The median new-home price increased 0.5% to $95,500 from a revised $95,000 in October.    The department said that 358,000 houses remained unsold at the end of November, up from a revised 356,000 the month before and the most since February 1985. The backlog represented a 6.6-month supply, up from a revised 6.4-month supply in October and the highest since August.    Prices of older homes have climbed more slowly than those for new ones in recent months, fueling considerably greater demand for them. The pace of existing-home sales reached a seven-year high of 3.92 million units at an adjusted annual rate in November, up 2.9% from October's level, according to the National Association of Realtors.    &quot;If the existing-home market is going so strong, I can't understand why new-home sales aren't going in at least the same direction,&quot; said Joseph Hu, a senior vice president and mortgage research director for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Mr. Hu and some other analysts said the tempo of new-home sales should edge up soon, perhaps hitting an annual pace of 675,000 to 700,000 units during the first half of 1987. They said mortgage rates, already at their eight-year low, probably will fall somewhat further, helping to spur the anticipated improvement.    Nevertheless, sales of new single-family homes aren't likely to be as robust in 1987 as in 1986. Several housing experts forecast that this year's sales will total between 695,000 and 725,000 units, up from 688,000 in 1985. These analysts expect a slower pace of between 650,000 and 700,000 for next year.    Both the Midwest and the West, battered by energy and agricultural problems, experienced hefty decreases in new-home sales in November. Sales fell 25.7% and 8.6% respectively in those regions. In the South, sales picked up a slight 1.2%, but in the Northeast, they surged 21.1% from relatively depressed levels in October.    ---   Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 1.2% rise in November and a 0.5% rise in October.                                        Nov.
