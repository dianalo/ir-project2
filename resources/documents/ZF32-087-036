 A recent Office of Management and Budget (OMB)survey reveals that 25 of 27 agencies surveyed are involved in thesystems design stage of extensive optical system projects.andO;Imaging technology involves the use of raster image files that areprocessed and stored by a computer.andP;  The OMB estimates that over1.74 billion pages of data will be processed on-line by 1993 andthat expenditures on imaging technology projects will grow to $214million during the same period.andP;  Although studies indicate thatimaging systems, largely due to document conversion costs, canincrease storage expenditures, it produces substantial savings inboth processing costs and processing time.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Imaging TechnologyInformation storage and retrievalGovernment AgencyCost of CommunicationsStrategic Planning.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The federal government receives, processes and stores billions of paperdocuments each year.andP;  Increasingly, agencies are turning to electronicimaging as one means of coping with this torrent of paperwork.andP;  What iselectronic imaging, anyway?andM;Image processing refers to raster image files, as opposed to ASCII text orvector graphics, that can be processed and stored by a computer.andM;Raster images typically are brought into a computer through the use of acamera or scanner.andP;  They have only the appearance of text or objects; theyare stored as pixels, displayed as dots on a page screen.andP;  Image processingprovides a computer &quot;picture&quot; of a paper document.andM;To assess what the government is doing to move from paper toelectronic-document handling, the Office of Management and Budget recentlysurveyed 27 agencies on their imaging plans.andM;All but two of the 27 agencies reported one or more intended uses of imageprocessing systems.andP;  Although a few agencies have established systems thusfar, 70 percent of the projects reported are at the early systems designstage.andM;Agencies have projects planned for processing tax forms and remittances,medical device information, food additive petitions, personnel securityclearance information, Superfund financial records and technical data.andM;Based on the figures reported to OMB, federal expenditures for imageprocessing technology will more than double between 1989 and 1993, exceeding$214 million by 1993.andM;These projections probably are low, as most of the agencies were too early intheir image systems development to estimate planned expenditures fully.andM;Three key projects account for the lion's share of imaging spending: 1) theDefense Department's Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support projectto support the technical data requirements of weapon system maintenance,repair and supply; 2) the Internal Revenue Service's tax system redesignproject to handle remittance and tax return processing; and 3) the Patent andTrademark Office system to support patent examination and patent informationdissemination.andM;Sharper ImageandM;Besides the spending increase, the size of on-line image bases also isexpected to grow -- from 85 million pages processed in 1988 to a cumulativetotal of 1,743 million pages by 1993.andM;The imaging projects reported to OMB suggest several general characteristicsabout the most effective uses of imaging.andP;  Imaging appears to be well-suitedfor information that is:andM;* Best represented a page at a time.andM;* Represented by handwriting.andM;* Represented by graphics or photographs.andM;* Contained in a form.andM;* In final form, so that it needs no further updates.andM;* Generated on paper by individuals or small businesses.andM;OMB found that, in general, imaging is less expensive when access toinformation must be rapid, such as when answering a telephone inquiry, orwhen information has to be accessed by several people at the same time, suchas multiple users referring to a single set of manuals.andM;Imaging can be costly because of the memory and processing power required torun an imaging application, the custom software often needed and the largeamounts of storage required,  However, OMB found that benefits can bequantified in terms of lower processing and paper storage costs and shorterretrieval times.andM;Comparisons between a paper system and an electronic imaging system helpdemonstrate the benefits of imaging:andM;Paper     ImagingandM;Processing CostsandM;per Form         22 Cents     8 CentsandM;Processing TimeandM;per Form        3-5 Weeks    3 DaysandM;Storage CostsandM;per PAge         0.68 Cent   1 CentandM;This suggests that although quantifiable benefits favor imaging fortime-critical applications, storage cost comparisons do not favor imagingtechnology.andP;  This is because raster images require large amounts of storage.andM;Days to SecondsandM;The implication is tht benefits are more likely to be realized intransaction-oriented or time-sensitive applications.andP;  For example, the IRSexpects, during the peak load in tax season, to cut processing time per taxstatement by a factor of 7 as a result of imaging.andM;The Department of Veterans Affairs found that with its image processingsystem it now takes about 45 seconds to find information on a particularveteran.andP;  Under the paper system it took as much as three days to find thissame information.andM;In making a cost comparison between a paper system and an imaging system,agencies also must consider the costs associated with document conversion,including optical character recognition.andP;  These costs may account for a majorportion of the start-up costs for an imaging system.andM;This is especially important when many paper pages must be converted beforesystem implementation.andM;Costs for document conversion may vary, depending on the condition of thedocuent to be converted.andM;For example, a paper document in poor condition could cost up to $1 toconvert to an image; one in good condition might cost 19 cents.andM;Robert V.
