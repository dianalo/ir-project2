Assuming the dissipativeeffects present in the model to have different order of magnitude weshow that the wave amplitude is ruled by an evolution equation involvingnonlinear higher order terms. Finally we investigate the steady-statesolutions and point out under what circumstances the obtained equationadmits a Burgers shock-like solution.</TEXT></DOC>
