(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>CENTREX -- THE BASIC BENEFITSandM;Centrex is a business telephone service offered by a local telephone companyfrom a local central office.andP;  It's basically single-line telephone servicedelivered to individual desks (the same as you get at your house) withimportant &quot;bells and whistles&quot; (features) added.andM;Some of those &quot;bells and whistles&quot; include intercom, call forwarding, calltransfer, toll restrict, least cost routing and call hold (on a single-linephone).andM;Think about your home phone.andP;  You know how you keep getting those littleadvertisements with your phone bill?andP;  The ones hawking &quot;custom-calling&quot;features.andP;  there are usually four big ones -- call forwarding, call waiting,call conferencing and speed calling.andM;Centrex is basically custom calling out of control.andP;  Custom calling gonebeserk.andP;  Instead of four features, you get 19, even more.andP;  Like customcalling, Centrex features are provided by the local telco's central office.andO;Centrex is leased to businesses by the telco as a substitute for a telephonesystem -- PBX or key system.andM;Before divestiture, Centrex was presumed dead.andP;  ATandamp;T was intent on becoming amajor PBX/key-system player.andP;  Then divestiture hit.andP;  And the operatingcompanies recognized they were no longer part of ATandamp;T, no longer hadfactories to support, but did have a huge number of Centrex installation thatwere providing large monthly revenues.andM;As a result the local operating companies have injected new life into theservice, making it more attractive in features, price, service and attitude.andO;Here are the main reasons businesses go with Centrex as against going withstandalone systems:andM;* Money.andP;  Centrex is typically cheaper to get into (the central officealready exists).andP;  Installation charges can be low.andP;  And commitment can alsobe low, since most Centrex service is leased on a month-to-month basis.andO;Local PUCs have let the BOCs do what they please as far as price for awhilenow.andP;  Prices have really dropped in a huge way.andP;  Figure nearly half the costfor a Centrex line as opposed to PBX and digital keys.andM;So it's good for companies planning an early move.andP;  There may be someeconomies of scale, also.andP;  Some operating companies are offeringlow-cost/large-size packages.andM;* Multiple Locations.andP;  Companies with multiple locations in the same cityoften find it cheaper to go with Centrex than with multiple private phonesystems and tie lines, or with one private phone system and OPX lines.andM;* Growth.andP;  It's theoretically easier to grow Centrex than a standalone PBX orkey system, which usually has a finite limit.andP;  With Centrex, it's hard to runout of paths, memory, intercom lines, phones, tie lines, CO lines, etc.andP;  Thelimit on the growth of Centrex is your central office, which may be manythousands of lines.andM;* Small Footprint.andP;  You don't have to put any switching equipment in youroffice.andP;  That's all taken care of back at the CO, remember?andP;  All you need inyour office are phones.andM;* Fewer Operators.andP;  Centrex has inherent DID (Direct Inward Dialing) feaures.andO;This cuts down on the number of operator positions you need to staff sincephones are ringing right at people's desks.andP;  Save money on people and space.andM;* DID.andP;  Many people and, more importantly, customers prefer to dial whomeverthey want directly rather than going through a central operator.andP;  Saves time(if the person you're calling is there, anyway).andM;* Very Reliable.andP;  This is perhaps the most legitimate bullet in this litanyof Centrex praise (Rembember, we're only giving you the benefits here.andP;  Thereare, of course, some serious problems with the service.).andP;  Whatever.andP;  COs areextremely reliable.andM;Here are some of the features built into modern central offices: redundancy,load-sharing circuitry, power back-up, on-line diagnostics, 24-hour on-sitepersonnel, mirror image architecture, 100% power-failure phone, complete DCbattery backup and battery powered.andP;  They're engineered to suffer less thanthree hours down-time every 40 years.andM;Though NYNEX workers are still on strike in our neck of the woods ...andM;* Non-blocking.andP;  Trunking constraints are largely eliminated with Centrex,since COs are so damn big.andM;* Low Cost Repair.andP;  It's cheap.andP;  Service time is theoretically immediate too.andO;People are right next to the machine all day.andP;  Phones are the only offcentral-office premise repair.andP;  But you can plug them in, plug them outyourself.andP;  All other equipment is in the central office.andP;  You need not holdinventory or test equipment.andP;  (However, as to service, it took New York Telover a week to make a five minute adjustment to the Centrex lines we have inour testdrive laboratory.andP;  So you never know, do you?)andM;* The Technology Remains Fairly Up-To-Date.andP;  Again, modern COs are seriouschunks of technology.andP;  They keep themselves pretty much on or near thecutting edge.andM;Centrex, like outlaws and hired guns from America's cleaner past, is known bymany names among the telcos.andP;  But the offerings are all pretty much the same.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
