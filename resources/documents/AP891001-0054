It was the latest chapter in ahistoric exodus from a divided Soviet bloc.   ``We made it, we made it!'' screamed one tearful young womanafter arriving in this northern Bavarian city at dawn.   ``We had no future there,'' said 34-year-old Uwe Kuester ofCottbus.   About 6,000 refugees either arrived or were on their way fromCzechoslovakia, border police said, and another 800 arrived fromPoland.   The refugees began gathering weeks ago in the West Germanembassies in Warsaw and Prague after they were unable to reachHungary, a liberal Warsaw Pact nation that had opened its westernborder to the East Germans last month.   Many of those arriving wept with joy. Others cheered and clapped.   In Prague and Warsaw, East Germans who heard of the exodus racedto railroad stations, some arriving in time to jump on board thetrains. West German news reports and witnesses said more EastGermans were rushing in their cars toward Czechoslovakia and atleast 200 were once again filling the embassy in Prague.   Up to 100 more East Germans assembled at the West German Embassyin Warsaw on Sunday.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germanyindicated in a television interview late Sunday that West Germanywas talking with East Germany about passage to the West for the newrefugees.   ``Also in the future, we will use all our powers andpossibilities to help those (seeking refuge), as we have done inthe past and up until the last several hours,'' Genscher said inthe interview with the ZDF television network.   Genscher later told ARD television he hoped for a ``parallelsolution'' for the latest East Germans at the embassy in Prague.   The new arrivals follow the more than 24,000 East Germans whohave fled through Hungary since Sept. 10, when the reform-mindedCommunist government in Budapest decided to open its border.   Hard-line East Germany reluctantly agreed to the exodus andtrains began shuttling refugees from Prague late Saturday. Trainsfrom Poland arrived on Sunday.   The East German government insisted the refugees from Prague andWarsaw had been ``expelled.''   On Sunday the East German Foreign Ministry accused West Germanyof ``damaging international norms'' by giving East Germans refugeinside Bonn's embassies in Prague and Warsaw in the first place,the government's ADN television reported.   As part of the agreement with West Germany that was announcedSaturday night, the East Germans had to travel in state-run trainsback through their former Communist homeland as a face-savingmeasure for the government.   Czechoslovakia, also with a hard-line government, had vowed thatit would not allow the refugees to leave for the West fromCzechoslovakia.   Still, the action represented an embarrassing retreat for theaging leadership in East Berlin, which had severely criticizedHungary's action.   The once-unthinkable exodus of East Germans reflects dramaticchanges in the Soviet bloc and a growing disunity among its memberstates.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the galvanizing force forreforms sweeping much of Eastern Europe, will visit East BerlinFriday and Saturday for celebrations of East Germany's 40thanniversary.   His talks with East German leader Erich Honecker are expected todeal with the exodus, which has threatened the nation's alreadydemoralized work force.   ``I hope that Gorbachev, during his talks with the leaders of(East Germany) will try to convince them that political reforms arealso in the interest of the German Democratic Republic,'' saidGenscher.   A high-ranking Soviet official was quoted by the West German DieWelt newspaper as saying Moscow welcomed East Germany's decision toallow the weekend exodus.   Valentin Falin, head of the Soviet Central Committee'sinternational relations section, also said he believed Gorbachevwill travel to East Berlin with important messages for both Germangovernments, Die Welt said. There was no elaboration.   East Berlin emphasized it expected the latest exodus to be aone-time event, after which West Germany would return to ``normalinternational customs'' at its embasssies.   In Prague, police initially surrounded the West German embassyto block newly arrived East Germans from scaling a spiked fenceinto the muddy grounds. But the embassy later again began lettingEast Germans back into the embassy.   Bavarian border police spokesman Klaus Pappenfuss said sixtrains were bringing the more than 6,000 refugees from Pragueduring the course of the day.   Well-wishers handed out bottles of wine, champagne and fruit asthe East Germans disembarked in Hof. Red Cross volunteersdistributed hot tea, noodle soup, baby food and diapers to therefugee families.   Several former East Germans, who had fled earlier to the Westfrom Hungary, carried a banner that read:   ``We got out through Hungary and you made it through Prague.Soon the zone (East Germany) will be an empty coffin.''   Sven Mueller, a 27-year-old metal worker, said: ``It was strangepassing through East Germany on our way here, but we knew we wereall right because there were West German officials on board.''   Many of the refugees quickly made their way to a bank oftelephone booths in the station in efforts to reach relatives inEast Germany.   Most had little or no West German currency, and those who didfaced constant busy signals from East Germany's overtaxed telephonecircuits.   Amid the crush on the platform, loud-speakers called out thenames of new arrivals who had relatives waiting for them.   The East Germans were taken immediately to several refugeeprocessing centers and temporary shelters set up by border policeand the military, officials said.   West German law automatically grants East Germans citizenship onarrival. More than 100,000 East Germans have emigrated or fled toWest Germany this year.   The have flooded to the West because of disillusionment withpolitical repression and economic stagnation in their homeland.   Horst Waffenschmidt, a state secretary in the federal InteriorMinistry, said Bonn had not paid money to secure passage for therefugees and was not asked to.</TEXT></DOC>
