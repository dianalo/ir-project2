The effect of X-irradiationwith 4 Gy was mainly a cytostatic one leading to an altered distributionof the cells throughout the cycle due to radiation induced mitotic delay.The cytocidal effect is negligible. As is known from previous studies(Fietkau, Friede and Maurer-Schultze, 1984) the effect of 200 mg/kg Ara-Cconsists of an inhibition of DNA synthesis and of killing a considerableportion of the L 1210 cells, predominantly of S phase cells. No significantdifferences between the various combined therapies were found. Whole-bodyX-irradiation with 4 Gy followed by the application of 200 mg/kg Ara-C10 hr later resulted in the greatest increase of the mean survival timeof tumour-bearing animals, from 13.2 to 17.4 days. It was shown thatapart from the cytocidal effect on S-phase cells, Ara-C also kills cellssublethally damaged by a preceding X-irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
