The U.N.'s possible blacklisting of Mr. Simon (editorial page, Jan. 30) makes me wonder who is the worse enemy of the blacks in South Africa. If anything, Mr. Simon's album &quot;Graceland&quot; has brought more awareness about the problems in South Africa. In effect, the U.N. is punishing the black musicians of South Africa by not allowing them to work with American and British musicians. The U.N. may have good intentions, but unfortunately good intentions will not overcome apartheid.    William E. Bennett   Newton, Mass.   ---   Poor Paul Simon. A victim of blacklisting. Being punished for what some people believe to be incorrect political views. Hasn't the entertainment industry run into a blacklisting problem before?    Ah, yes! The McCarthy era. Sen. Joseph McCarthy was vehemently denounced for causing some left-wing types to be blacklisted. Careers were ruined. Lives were destroyed. Now entertainers are being blacklisted for performing in South Africa. Yet no one is complaining about the South African blacklist -- only the fact that Paul Simon may be the latest victim.
