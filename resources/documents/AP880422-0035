Education Secretary William Bennett said Thursday that theReagan administration opposes the $2.5 billion Act for Better ChildCare. But he said the tax credit proposal meets theadministration's standards for a child care policy and hepersonally favors it.   Bennett told members of the House Education and Laborsubcommittee on human resources he didn't know whether theadministration would offer its own child care tax credit plan orsupport other federal initiatives to help make care more affordableand available.   ``I couldn't tell you,'' he said. ``It's a matter of debate anddiscussion within the administration right now.''   Three approaches were discussed at the hearing: the ABC billbacked by Democratic leaders and scores of groups representingwomen, children, labor, churches and medical personnel; a taxcredit bill sponsored by Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La.; and amiddle-ground proposal introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, andRep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.   The Holloway bill would give all families a credit of $150 to$400 per preschool child, whether the children were cared for athome or elsewhere. Total cost: $800 million. The government alreadyis spending $3.7 billion on a dependent care tax credit availableto families with children in day care, Holloway said.   Bennett said any child care policy endorsed by theadministration would have to strengthen the family, treatstay-at-home mothers fairly, not promote any particular type ofcare, target funds to those most in need and help people withoutsetting up a new bureaucracy.   He said the Holloway approach meets all those tests.   The tax credit concept also appears to sidestep church-stateproblems cited by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is inan odd alliance with conservatives in opposing the ABC bill.   The ACLU objections center on the possibility thatreligious-sponsored day care programs would qualify for ABC grantsand parent subsidies. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Dale Kildee,D-Mich., said he is working on changes to make sure churches areeligible, while the ACLU says the bill even as introduced violatesthe separation of church and state.   ``This is one big new federal trough for churches,'' said BarryLynn, legislative counsel to the ACLU. ``Too many of them want itand they're not willing to recognize the serious constitutionalissues here.''   Three-quarters of the ABC money would help pay the child carebills in families making up to 115 percent of a state's medianincome. The rest would go for training and salaries for child careworkers, renovation of facilities and referral programs forparents. A national advisory panel would develop minimum federalchild care standards.   Supporters of the bill say the federal government must play thelead role in helping to expand day care services, ensure theirquality and make them more affordable to American families.   But conservatives including Phyllis Schlafly complained Thursdaythat the ABC bill is too expensive and cumbersome, promotesinstitutional care and discriminates against parents who stay athome with their children. And they said the income cutoff in thebill would let some families earning $40,000 get financial help.   The Hatch-Johnson Child Care Services Improvement Act would givestates $250 million in grant money for day care expansion andscholarships and $100 million to start risk pools to limit providerliability. Another $25 million would be available to help homeproviders meet state licensing requirements.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association ofManufacturers have endorsed positions similar to the Hatch-Johnsonapproach.</TEXT></DOC>
