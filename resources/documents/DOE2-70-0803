Electrical resistivitiesincrease linearly from the superconducting onset temperature (100{sup0}K) to 450 C where oxygen starts to evolve from this material, and thenbegin to deviate from linear temperature dependence. The experimentalresults indicate that electrical resistivity in this material is associatedwith the defect species (charge carrier) population due to oxygen stoichiometry.Electrical conductivities were also measured as a function of oxygenpartial pressure (1 to 10/sup -4/ atm) at various temperatures. At P(O/sub2/) andgt; 10/sup -1/ atm the conductivity shows a 1/4th slope dependenceon oxygen partial pressure while at P(O/sub 2/) andless; 10/sup 1/ atm the conductivityis proportional to P(O/sub 2/)/sup 1/2/. The conductivity behavior withoxygen stoichiometry suggests that the electron holes associated withCu/sup +3/ play an important role as charge carriers in this material,and even at x andless; 6.5 p-type conduction is predominant.</TEXT></DOC>
