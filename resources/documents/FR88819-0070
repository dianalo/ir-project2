Williams, Deputy General Counsel, (202) 377-6459, Office of GeneralCounsel, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington,DC 20552.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>The Board recently has had the opportunityto revisit its policies regarding the extent to which savings and loanholding companies and other controlling persons of insured institutionsshould be required to contribute financial assistance to the insured institutions.The Board is aware that the open-ended, unlimited in duration regulatorycapital maintenance obligation that is customarily imposed in connectionwith approvals of applications to acquire insured institutions may deterpotential acquirors from considering such acquisitions. In reviewing itspractices in this area, the Board has concluded that other approaches tothe issue of an acquiror's obligations to financially support its insuredinstitution would be effective in attaining the goals of protecting theinsured institution and the FSLIC, with less deterrence to potential acquirorsthan the current form of obligation.The Board believes that it is important for potential applicants and thepublic to be informed of the Board's views on this issue and accordinglyhas determined to issue the following policy statement:<ITAG tagnum="85">Policy Statement on Regulatory Capital Maintenance Obligations ofInsured Institution Acquirors</ITAG>This policy statement expresses the Board's views regarding the impositionof conditions, incident to approval of holding company, change in control,or other applications, that require an applicant to agree to maintain theregulatory capital of the acquired insured institution at specified levels.As a general matter, the Board continues to believe that savings and loanholding companies that control the practices of their insured subsidiariesand enjoy the benefits of such control, including FSLIC insurance of accounts,should support such institutions during periods of financial weakness orinstability. Providing financial assistance to subsidiary institutionsenhances the institution's capital base and helps to promote its continuedviability, which, in turn, protects the FSLIC fund from loss. The overalleffect of such action is to help to maintain a safe and sound financialsystem and to promote depositor confidence.The Board has concluded, however, that the Board's expectation that anacquiror should play a positive role with respect to its insured institutionshould not continue to be implemented via a practice of conditioning approvalsof holding company and certain change in control applications upon an open-endedrequirement that the acquiror agrees to maintain the regulatory capitalof the institution. The Board believes that such an approach may have hadthe effect of deterring qualified acquirors from making investments inthe thrift industry.Accordingly, the Board has determined that the imposition of open-endedregulatory capital maintenance obligations upon acquirors in connectionwith acquisitions of insured institutions should be discontinued. Nevertheless,the Board will generally require acquirors to make a commitment to theinsured institution that will provide the acquiror with sufficient incentiveto prudently manage the insured institution and will provide the FSLICwith a reasonable amount of protection against adverse events and the uncertaintyand time lags inherent in a regulatory capital and accounting system basedon historical costs.The Board will, as a general rule, require a ``net worth maintenance agreement''or a ``prenuptial agreement'' to satisfy this requirement. In a net worthmaintenance agreement, which shall be limited or capped, the acquiror agreesthat the Board can require the infusion of additional equity capital if,during the term of the agreement, the insured institution fails to meetits regulatory capital requirement or the institution's regulatory capitaldeclines below a predetermined amount. The aggregate amount of infusionthat could be required, at a single time or in multiple infusions, wouldbe limited or capped at a specified amount in the agreement.A prenuptial agreement permits an officer of the FSLIC the right to votethe securities of the institution held by the acquiror respecting certainactions, to remove and replace the board of directors of the institution,or to dispose of any or all of the securities of the institution ownedby the acquiror in the event the institution's regulatory capital declinesbelow a specified percentage of an institution's liabilities or assets.The Board will generally require one of these two forms of agreements.The acquiror may negotiate the form of agreement; however, it may selectthe net worth maintenance agreement only if the Board is satisfied thatthe acquiror has adequate resources to satisfy its obligations under thenet worth agreement.The Board itself will also consider other approaches to meeting the objectivesidentified above. In all cases, the requirements will be evidenced by aseparate agreement that the acquiror will be required to execute beforeacquisition of the insured institution.The above-described treatment of acquirors' regulatory capital maintenanceobligations will be applied prospectively, in connection with applicationsapproved after this policy goes into effect. With regard to holding companiesand other acquirors that are subject to other forms of obligations, suchobligations shall remain in full force and effect except to the extentthat the Board agrees in writing to the modification of any such obligation.Guidelines may be issued to assist in the implementation of this policy,including determining aspects of such agreements that would present significantissues of law or policy warranting consideration by the Board itself ofthe holding company application or change in control notice.Finally, the Board notes that in all cases, regardless of whether an explicitagreement is required or not, should the insured institution's capitallevel fall below that required by the Board's regulations, or otherwisebe deemed inadequate by the institution's Prinicipal Supervisory Agent,the Board retains the ability to establish individual minimum capital requirementsfor the institution pursuant to 12 CFR 563.14, or to issue a capital directivepursuant to 12 CFR 563.14-1 to require the institution to increase capital,or both.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
