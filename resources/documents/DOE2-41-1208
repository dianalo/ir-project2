<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-1208 </DOCNO><TEXT>A detailed investigation of the Tl-Ca-Ba-Cu-O system of high temperaturesuperconductors is presented including static magnetization, electricaltransport, structural and processing data for sintered and melted bulkceramics, single crystals, and polycrystalline thin films. This systemis shown by x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive x-ray analysis tohave at least five distinct superconducting phase containing either twoor three Cu-O sheets separated by one or two Tl-O planes. Bulk ceramicTl-2223 has a Meissner effect up to 124 K and zero resistance up to 120K, but transition temperatures are found to be a strong function of processingeven for single crystals. Magnetization versus field data suggest weakflux pinning in all samples above 30 K. Melt processed bulk ceramicsof Tl-2223 have transport critical current densities andgt;5000 A/cm{sup 2}at 76 K with modest magnetic field dependence, indicating strong intergranularlinks which are not present in Y-123. This is also observed for unorientedpolycrystalline thin films. Tl-2223 films have critical current densitiesat 76 K up to 240,000 A/cm{sup 2} with a modest dependence on in-planemagnetic fields, implying negligible effects of grain boundary Josephsonjunctions. 29 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
