At its Wednesday meeting, the UAL board also authorized acontroversial $32 million to lawyers and investment bankers tocover incurred by a failed pilot-management buyout proposal of theparent of United Airlines.   The company already had paid pilots and management $27 millionas reimbursement for buyout expenses. The payments were questionedlast month in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee onantitrust, monopolies and business rights.   The UAL board is under pressure from the investor group ConistonPartners, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, to sell orrestructure the company to boost share prices.   Coniston has threatened to launch a shareholder drive to dumpmost of UAL's directors.   After its regularly scheduled meeting at UAL's Chicago-areaheadquarters, the board issued a statement indicating the companywould consider takeover proposals from third parties as well as anemployee-management group.   ``While no proposal has been received by the board, continuingdiscussions are occurring with certain employee groups with respectto the basis and the terms of a possible buyout proposal,'' thestatement said.   ``The outside directors will consider acquisition proposals fromthe management-employee group or any other third party when suchproposals are made.''   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has been under pressure to come upwith a firm proposal for raising the company's stock price andstaving off disgruntled investors.   UAL stock closed at $168.75 a share on the New York StockExchange, down $8 from Tuesday.   Analysts said the drop indicated that investors did not believeany takeover agreement is near completion.   ``The conclusion from observers is that there is no deal closeto being consummated to take the company private, recapitalize oranything like that,'' said Stephen Dexter, an analyst with KemperFinancial Services Inc. in Chicago.   UAL management, in meetings with employee groups, has circulateda new employee buyout plan that would value the company at $240 ashare, or $5.43 billion, the Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday,quoting unidentified sources.   Leaders of the flight attendants and pilots unions have saidthey would carefully review the proposal. But the powerfulMachinists union, which represents about 25,000 of UAL's 70,000workers, already has criticized the plan.   Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle a $6.75 billionpilot-management bid supported by British Airways PLC for United,the nation's second-largest airline in October.</TEXT></DOC>
