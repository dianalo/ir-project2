Today it is so full andbusy that sellers of goods and produce have spilled out into thehighway that runs by it.   Local merchants and traders from neighboring Senegal and TheGambia here on Africa's northwest shoulder haggle with millingcrowds from behind counters full of rice, fruits and vegetables,meat, fish and brightly patterned bolts of cloth.   Prices are much higher than those at poorly stocked, state-runArmazens do Povo stores, but supplies are plentiful.   ``The day I arrived two years ago, there was not one bottle ofbeer in the country,'' said Anne Williams of the U.S. Agency forInternational Development, illustrating the dearth of things then.She had brought food and other supplies with her but now relies onthe local markets for her needs.   The new bounty is due in most part to the government's decisionin late 1986 _ following along with other African countries insimilarly precarious straits _ to cast aside some of the basicMarxist concepts it adopted after independence from Portugal in 1974and liberalize one of the world's poorest economies.   It lifted price controls and trade restrictions at the behest ofthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and stamped outblack-marketeering all in one swoop. The measures have taken hold ifthe Bandim Market is any test.   State control of the economy was the norm for many Africannations, Guinea-Bissau among them, following independence fromEuropean colonizers.   Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria, Zaire and the Ivory Coast are all inthe process of divesting state-own companies and looking for buyersin the private sector.   Of the five former Portuguese African colonies, Sao Tome ePrincipe, the island nation off Gabon, has taken the greateststrides to shed Marxist economic trappings, dissolving controls andopening up markets to private buyers and investment.   Mozambique and Angola, other former Portuguese colonies thatadopted Marxist economics, are moving toward liberalization, but thetransition is hampered by guerrilla wars that disrupt theireconomies.   Nowadays, Bissauans with money can dine on grilled shrimp and hot``piri-piri'' sauce at the Galeao restaurant and dance at discoslike the Tropicana and Tabanca.   Pigs and chickens still scrabble around the open sewers of poorerareas, but children playing in the shade of long, corrugated ironverandahs show few of the signs of malnutrition so widespread twoyears ago.   After a long, bloody struggle for independence from Portugal, thePartido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC),under the leadership of Luis Cabral, embarked in 1974 on athen-fashionable road of Marxist-inspired development viaindustrialization.   But by 1980, after channeling investment away from agricultureand toward large-scale industrial projects like an auto plant thatclosed down when parts ran out and the Cumere agro-industrial plantthat never got off the ground, Guinea-Bissau's economy was in ruins.   A series of droughts drastically reduced rice production, andfood supplies lessened as the population grew.   Cabral was ousted by the military in a November 1980, and PrimeMinister Joao ``Nino'' Vieira took over.   Manuel dos Santos, his minister of state for commerce, economiccoordination and tourism, says liberalization of trade has brought achange in the quality of life as well as financial improvement.   ``Essential goods have always been available, but only on theblack market,'' he said. ``Now there's hardly a black market tospeak of.''   Dos Santos said he expects to bring inflation down from itscurrent annual rate of 50 percent to 15 or 20 percent by year's end.   Since 1986, Guinea-Bissau's economic growth has averaged morethan 5 percent a year, a reversal of the days when it figured on theminus side.   Today, a kilo (2.2 pounds) of Guinean-grown rice costs about1,000 Guinean pesos (50 cents) in the Bandim Market, but a housewifein search of something rarer, must pay twice that much for a singlecarrot.   That's expensive in what is still one of the world's 15 poorestcountries; its annual per capita income is about $190.   But the government hopes two recent accords with Portugaldesigned to guarantee the convertibility of the peso into othercurrencies and to set up a commercial bank to finance smallbusinesses, should help increase trade and prosperity.   In addition to making more funds available from Lisbon, pesoconvertibility should halt a considerable flow of goods out throughSenegal, where traders make their deals in CFA francs, which isbacked by the Bank of France. CFA (French initials for AfricanFinancial Community) francs are the currency of former Frenchcolonies in Africa and the currency is pegged to the French franc,which made it more reliable than the peso.   According to dos Santos, 70 to 80 percent of trade is nowcontrolled by the Guinea-Bissau's private sector. Two years ago, hesaid, it was just the contrary.   Diplomats and others say the loosening of economic reins inGuinea-Bissau is likely to bring more, through less radical,liberalization in the political sphere.   The government is expected to approve a simplified foreigninvestment code. It will be followed by a revised constitution,that, though falling short of a shift toward a multi-party system,will allow more popular participation in government.   In addition to strengthening ties with Portugal, Prime MinisterVieira has managed to continue to receive aid from many othercountries, Eastern and Western, to help support his population ofnearly 1 million people.   ``There's still a huge international aid effort going on here,and Guinea-Bissau is one of the darlings of the aid agencies,'' saidRobert Collingwood, delegate of the European Economic Community inBissau.   Aid workers say Guinea-Bissau's attraction is due in part to itssuccess in swallowing bitter IMF and World Bank austerity medicine,including a sharp devaluation of the peso and massive cuts in publicspending.   The current foreign debt stands at about $270 million on whichthe country pays an annual debt service of $28.9 million.   ``Humanitarian organizations have always had a romantic sympathyfor the PAIGC, as Guinea-Bissau was one of the few African countriesto actually fight for its independence,'' said one aid official. Healso said agencies are attracted by Guinea-Bissau's small area(about the size of Connecticut and Massachuetts combined) that makesexperimental projects easy to supervise.   The country's main export cash crop, cashew nuts, a recentintroduction on World Bank recommendations, accounted for more thanhalf the $15-million in exports last year.   Dos Santos says fishing is Guinea-Bissau's best hope since it ison the Atlantic Ocean.   ``It could provide us with the most resources in the shortesttime and could make up about 50 percent of our exports.''   But it needs more fishermen, boats and equipment.   Bissau's Pindjiguiti port is still a sleepy place; the countryexported only about $500,000 worth of fish last year.   The United States has provided a $300,000 coastal surveillancesystem to help prevent poaching in Guinea-Bissau's waters.   ``What we really need are more fishing boats with productionfacilities on board and better training,'' said dos Santos.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, March 19</NOTE></DOC>
