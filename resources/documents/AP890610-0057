Police arrested more than 1,000 people in the confrontations,which came on the second anniversary of the start of the June 1987riots that brought down the authoritarian regime of former presidentChun Doo-hwan.   Opposition groups denounced Roh for deciding not to hold apromised referendum on his presidency and demanded he go ahead withthe vote.   Violence broke out in central Seoul when students hurled rocksand bricks at riot police who tried to stop protest marches. Policefired volleys of tear gas and made baton charges to disperseprotesters. Saturday afternoon shoppers ran for cover.   Students yelled, ``Crush the Roh Tae-woo regime'' and ``Yankee gohome.'' Police officials said more than 1,000 protesters werearrested and that there were dozens of minor injuries on both sides.One police commander said up to 5,000 people took part in theprotests, the worst in Seoul since labor and student protests inlate April.   The government deployed 20,000 riot police to block protests.Thousands of troops in combat fatigues and visored helmets guardeddowntown and key government buildings. About 20 busloads of riotpolice ringed the U.S. Embassy.   Protests began earlier Saturday when riot police blockeddemonstrations at two colleges by about 2,000 radical studentsdemanding to be allowed to attend a youth festival next month incommunist North Korea.   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend theathletic and cultural event, which mainly draws participants fromnon-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the northof attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoulgovernment.   About 1,500 students battled riot police with clubs and rocks atYonsei University when troops blocked them from marching off thecampus. About 500 protesters at nearby Sogang University foughtpolice with firebombs and rocks.   Thousands of students then gathered in the city center, wheremore fighting broke out as protesters called for Roh's resignation.   Student leaders denounced Roh and the United States, chargingthey keep the Korean peninsula divided. They called for unificationwith communist North Korea and the expulsion of the 43,000 U.S.troops based in South Korea.   The two Koreas are bitter rivals and have clashed frequently overthe years. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the KoreanWar.   South Korea's radical students and dissidents lack public supportbecause of their extremist views and violent tactics.   Opposition groups issued statements Saturday denouncing Roh forannouncing on Thursday that he will not hold a promised referendumon his performance. Roh promised the vote during the 1987presidential election campaign.   Roh said he decided to forego a vote because it would createunrest. A defeat in a referendum would discredit Roh and putpressure on him to resign.   Kim Dae-jung, head of the opposition Party for Peace andDemocracy, said Roh had to hold a referendum or the opposition wouldbe forced to mount an anti-government campaign. ``We cannot butfight ... if Roh intends to avoid the interim appraisal,'' Kim said.   About 250 students and dissidents Saturday ended ananti-government hunger strike at Seoul's Roman Catholic cathedral.Protesters, who had been fasting since May 25, took part in acandlelight vigil as hundreds of riot police ringed the cathedral.The officers did not intervene.</TEXT></DOC>
