Explicitapproximations, clearly displaying the scaling with physical parameters,are obtained for the triton confinement factor. A model loss region isdeveloped for the evaluation of particle ripple losses. The importanceof pitch angle scattering losses during the slowing down of tritons isalso estimated. A comparison between experimental and numerical calculationsrelative to the FT tokamak shows good qualitative agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
