According to the initial and limited Pentagon reports,there were virtually no reports of Iraqi resistance in theopening stages of the air battle.</LP><TEXT>   Late last night, Pentagon officials were spreading theword that the first waves of the attack had devastated Iraq'sair force, its missile complexes and its elite RepublicanGuard troops. First reports in wartime often are overlyoptimistic, but there seems little doubt that the campaigncrippled the Iraqi military to a significant degree.   Iraq's western missile sites were hit hard, but the U.S.believes Baghdad possesses hidden missiles and that repeatraids will be needed.   A key factor in the early success, the officials said, wasthat the very first targets hit were Iraqi command centers.These were struck by Stealth aircraft and cruise missilesthat Iraq couldn't detect. &quot;We may simply have paralyzed hiswhole system before he could respond,&quot; said one official. Buthe cautioned, &quot;We have to worry that we may start facinglosses later.&quot;   American reporters in Saudi Arabia, operating underPentagon reporting restrictions, were permitted to witness asquadron of Air Force fighters taking off shortly before 1a.m. Saudi time from an air base in central Saudi Arabia.   The F15E fighter-bombers, carrying extra fuel tanks forthe long trip north, disappeared into the dark sky, theirafterburners bright in the night air. The aircraft, which cancarry missiles, guns and thousands of pounds of bombs, can beused either to defend bomber aircraft or to attack groundtargets themselves.   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told thenation that &quot;the operation appears to have gone very well&quot; inits opening stage. Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, said &quot;so far there has been no airresistance.&quot;   At a news briefing in the Pentagon, the two men refused todiscuss casualties, saying it was too early to do so. Mr.Cheney said, &quot;I will simply say that at preliminary reports,we have received in terms of the success of the operation --and that includes the possibility of casualties -- have beenvery, very encouraging.&quot;   Mr. Cheney said, &quot;There have been a number of reports&quot; ofIraqi missiles being fired, &quot;but insofar as I am aware, theybasically are false reports.&quot;   The two men declined to provide many details of the airassault, except to say that it involved hundreds of planes,and was aimed mainly at military targets, including weaponsplants. They said British, Saudi and Kuwaiti aircraft wereinvolved.   Other unconfirmed reports said that the U.S. had fired asmany as 100 hard-to-detect cruise missiles in the openingsalvos, and that Iraq's missile response had failed, with ahandful of its Soviet-made SCUDs landing ineffectively.Reports from Israel indicated that the U.S. attack haddestroyed long-range missile sites in western Iraq, fromwhich Saddam Hussein had threatened to strike the Jewishstate.   Mr. Cheney would say only that &quot;the initial reaction fromthe Iraqis is such that I'm generally of the opinion that weachieved a fairly high degree of tactical surprise.&quot;   However, he repeatedly stressed that the operation was inits early stages. &quot;It is likely to run for a long period oftime,&quot; he said.   The attack began from the largest U.S. air base in thePersian Gulf region, and it employed the most deadly nightbombers in the Air Force's arsenal.   &quot;It is absolutely awesome. I mean the ground shook and youfelt it,&quot; said Col. Ray Davies, who watched the first groupof planes depart.   At home, the American public received an almost continuousupdate on sounds and sights of the air battle from televisioncorrespondents broadcasting live from the Iraqi capital ofBaghdad.   Beginning around 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the TVreporters, who were conveying impressions of nighttimebattles on the city's outskirts, reported four or five wavesof American aircraft striking targets west of the city,including a refinery.   The area to the west of Baghdad is believed to containprime targets, including missile sites, command centers, airbases and weapons plants.   At the air base in the middle of the Saudi desert, wheremore than 120 highperformance jets had been lined up on thetarmac only a few hours before, there was an almostcontinuous roar as successive pairs of F15s took off fortheir first mission. &quot;This is history in the making,&quot; saidCol. Davies, the base's chief maintenance officer.   The pilots, who had practiced night missions for months,showed hardly any emotion as they walked grimly toward theiraircraft and strapped themselves into the cockpits, accordingto Col. Davies. &quot;They knew exactly what they've got to do,&quot;he said. &quot;They know what the targets are . . . it's prettymuch mechanical.&quot;   Activity appeared to remain normal at several other largemilitary air bases around Saudi Arabia. Military officialsdidn't indicate whether bombers took off for Iraq from otherfields.   In Riyadh, a flock of U.S. KC135 aerial tankers bound fora rendezvous with the fighters tipped off residents that anattack was imminent.   In a statement released at the Pentagon, U.S. Gen. NormanSchwarzkopf, commander of the allied forces in the PersianGulf, told his troops: &quot;You are a member of the most powerfulforce our country, in coalition with our allies, has everassembled in a single theater to face such an aggressor.During my visits with you, I have seen in your eyes a fire ofdetermination to get this job done quickly so that we all mayreturn to the shores of our great nation.&quot;   ---   Robert S.
