British Telecommunications PLC, Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone Co. and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom hope to sign anagreement within weeks that could pave the way for them tooffer a joint service to multinationals, phone-companyofficials said. Specifically, the phone giants may offer toplan and manage the companies' internal telecommunicationssystems around the world, taking over a task normallyperformed by the multinationals' own technicians.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed alliance, which is a direct challenge toAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., is being engineered byBT. It would be the first of its kind among such powerfulinternational telecommunications-service companies, and mayspur similar alliances among their rivals elsewhere in theworld.   On paper, at least, the proposal is the boldest move yetby the three phone giants to expand their internationalbusinesses.   All three are under attack in their once-secure homemarkets from a rash of new, smaller competitors that arespringing up in the current world-wide trend of phonederegulation. In addition, for the past decade, all threehave been exploring new ways to milk more business frommultinational corporations, the biggest and most lucrativeclients in their respective home markets. &quot;The totalpotential market is huge&quot; for this latest service idea, saidLondon-based analyst John Dinsdale of market-research firmDataquest Inc.   But in practice, Mr. Dinsdale warned, the venture'ssuccess would hinge on exactly how the companies structureand price their service. It also remains to be seen how manymultinationals would want to contract out their phone-networkmanagement to three companies that are often criticized intheir home countries for being costly, bureaucraticpaper-mills.   A British Telecom spokesman confirmed news reports thathis company has already sounded out potential clients for theservice, including International Business Machines Corp. ofArmonk, N.Y. Although there haven't been any detailed talkswith clients, he said, &quot;our market research tells us that{the proposed service} is what the customers want.&quot; As aresult, he said, BT hopes to sign an agreement in principlewith its partners to begin a formal &quot;study phase&quot; of theservice, codenamed &quot;Pathfinder.&quot; He added that the servicewould have to clear several regulatory hurdles around theworld.   The U.S. market alone for private corporate networkservices is about $5 billion today and growing about 15% ayear, estimated Greg Sawers, an analyst at Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co., New York.   BT's ambitions in the U.S. include acquiring a majorlong-distance carrier to become the backbone network for themultinational network services company and compete head-onwith ATandamp;T for lucrative corporate network business.   However, to accomplish this BT needs a relaxation of U.S.rules which limit foreign ownership of a U.S. communicationscarrier that holds a radio license to 25%. The FederalCommunications Commission is currently considering such amove.   Pathfinder is quietly taking shape in a secret officelocated on the outskirts of Atlanta. Individuals close to BTsaid Pathfinder could be permanently based in New York, withthe network management center staying in Atlanta.   One individual said the operation is currently comprisedof about 20 people and is led by Gerald Thames, a former vicepresident with Telecom USA Inc., which was recently acquiredby MCI Communications Corp. The individual said Mr. Thames isgetting strenuous backing from David Dey, a former IBMexecutive who is managing director of BT's businesscommunications division, and BT Chairman Iain Vallance. Mr.Thames wasn't available for comment and was said to be inEngland.   Rumors have circulated within the telecommunicationsindustry that IBM would become a partner of the venture. Butan IBM spokesman said the company had &quot;no plans to get intothe common carrier business&quot; or to become a partner with BTin its venture. &quot;Compete with ATandamp;T? Forget it,&quot; he said.   But he did confirm that IBM had been approached by BT&quot;about mid to late last year&quot; about becoming one of the firstmultinational customers for the communications servicesnetwork.   The BT spokesman said that it is possible a U.S. companymight become involved in the alliance, but he declined toelaborate.   Most major multinationals have spent years patchingtogether costly networks of switches, computers, software andtelephone lines to connect their offices and factories aroundthe globe. Generally, the phone lines for these privatenetworks already are supplied by local phone companies ineach country. But to plan the worldwide system, order thelocal lines and keep the whole network running, mostmultinationals hire their own teams of in-house phonetechnicians.   Under the proposed new service, a multinational would handat least some of that internal communications work over tothe phone company consortium.   To get the contracts, the phone companies would argue thatthey're better qualified for such work than most internaltelecommunications teams, and could more easily handle allthe complexities of international phone regulation andtariffs. That would free the multinationals to concentrate ontheir own businesses -- whether it be making computers orcars, the BT spokesman said.   The phone companies would also offer &quot;one-stop-shopping&quot;for all the multinational's telecommunications-service needs,the BT spokesman said. In countries where the partners didn'tnormally operate, he said, they could negotiate on behalf oftheir multinational clients to get the needed lines andservices from local phone companies. If the customers wished,he added, the phone companies could also provide the neededoffice telephone equipment and could station their own staffat the multinational's plants.   And the potential political obstacles are numerous. Forinstance, NTT is limited by law to providing only domesticJapanese services; other companies -- chiefly Kokosai DenshinDaiwa Co. -- handle phone traffic in and out of Japan. An NTTspokesman in Tokyo, while confirming that talks with BT andTelekom are underway, declined to comment further.   In Europe, the plan would create a furor among othernational phone companies who would see it as a raid on themultinational business in their countries. Throughout Europe,where telecommunications regulations are graduallyliberalizing, the various national telecommunications-servicecompanies are all eyeing each others' businesses whilejealously guarding their own turfs.   A Telekom spokesman declined to comment on the talks,beyond confirming that &quot;we're negotiating with differentinternational partners over creating world-wide data andcommunications nets.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
