The motion was filed by eight Canadian asbestos companies and the Asbestos Institute, according to an attorney for the industry. The institute is two-thirds funded by Canada's federal government and the province of the Quebec. Several Canadian government officials said at a news conference in Montreal that they would support the motion.    In July, the EPA imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos, which was once commonly used in building materials. More than 100,000 workers in the U.S. have died from inhaling cancer-causing asbestos fibers, according to some estimates.    The ban sparked an immediate outcry in Canada, which produces more asbestos than any country except the Soviet Union. In the motion, the industry asks that the ban be overturned because asbestos products don't pose a &quot;reasonable risk,&quot; according to Tim Hardy, an attorney for the institute and the eight companies.    In Washington, an EPA spokesman said the agency hadn't seen the motion and hadn't any comment. </TEXT></DOC>
