(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's first lawsuit filed under anew federal law that bars housing discrimination against familieswith children has been settled out-of-court for $25,000.   A federal court on Tuesday approved the settlement between theJustice Department and LaFonge Associates, an apartment managementcompany.   The department charged that LaFonge had refused to rent aone-bedroom apartment to a single mother and her child.   The case against LaFonge, owner of Somerset Mews GardenApartments in Franklin Township, was the first under amendments tothe federal Fair Housing Act.   The amendments passed last year prohibit housing discriminationagainst people with handicaps and those with children. Retirementcommunities with special facilities for elderly people are exempt.   LaFonge officials denied any wrongdoing.   ``The owners do not want prolonged litigation to obscure theirlong-standing commitment to providing decent housing for allpersons,'' the company said.   ``Rather than devote substantial resources to litigation ...involving a single isolated incident, it is far more appropriate toresolve this issue in a way which truly serves the goal of fairhousing.''   The $25,000 award will go to the Housing Coalition of MiddlesexCounty, which brought the complaint to the Justice Department onbehalf of the woman.</TEXT></DOC>
