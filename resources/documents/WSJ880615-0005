Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JAPAN EUROP CANDA FREST </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The dollar shot up on news that the U.S. trade deficit for April had narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $9.89 billion, the smallest gap in more than three years.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood at 1.7495 marks, up 1.5% from 1.7228 marks late Monday, despite dollar sales by the West German central bank intended to temper its rise. The U.S. currency climbed to 126.56 yen from 125.08 yen a day earlier. The British pound fell 1.7% to $1.7854 from $1.8167.    In early Tokyo trading Wednesday, the dollar declined marginally to 126.35 yen and 1.7468 marks on profit taking.    The dollar hit its highest point against the mark since Oct. 28 and its peak against the yen since Dec. 7, according to Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    The Commerce Department said April's trade deficit shrank from a revised, seasonally adjusted $11.7 billion in March. The April figure was the smallest monthly deficit since December 1984, when the gap was $8.03 billion.    Carmine J. Rotondo, chief corporate dealer for Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said the market expected a deficit of $11 billion to $13 billion.    Robert Bauer, senior currency dealer at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, West Germany, said, &quot;Obviously, these figures are a major improvement.&quot; He added, &quot;the outlook can only be described as positive for the dollar, despite the overhang of the (U.S. presidential) elections five months from now. Any major downward correction in the short term is unlikely.&quot;    Upon release of the figures at 8:30 a.m. EDT, the dollar briefly shot up to 1.7400 marks from 1.7270 before the announcement. It then retreated on profit taking. When the U.S. currency began rising again, West Germany's Bundesbank intervened between 1.7370 and 1.7380 marks to knock the currency back to 1.7320 marks.    Nevertheless, the dollar kept rising, supported by the improving trade figures and relatively high U.S. interest rates. &quot;Everybody stepped back in as soon as they realized the central bank was out,&quot; said Mr. Rotondo.    While there weren't any precise estimates on the amount of the German central bank's dollar sales, dealers believed it was relatively small. &quot;It was just intended as a shot across the bow, saying 'we're here and don't want the dollar to go up very much,'&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at brokers James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    There were rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also had intervened, but they couldn't be confirmed.    At a White House briefing on the forthcoming Toronto Summit, Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford expressed satisfaction that there had been &quot;reasonable stability&quot; in exchange rates in recent months -- a characterization that appeared to include yesterday's moves.    While the U.S. wouldn't want the greenback to climb too high, yesterday's levels are believed to be comfortably within the broad secret ranges established by major industrial countries Dec. 22.    Mr. Mulford declined to comment on whether the U.S. needed to guard against a rising dollar eroding recent trade gains. U.S. officials have indicated there is plenty of room on the upside before the dollar's level would be considered harmful.    In late May and early June, the Bundesbank sold at least $3.3 billion in U.S. currency in private sales. Bundesbank Presdent Karl Otto Poehl has said the central bank's dollar sales weren't intended to prevent the dollar from rising, but rather to unload excess dollar reserves.    But dealers and economists remain skeptical. &quot;The Bundesbank would like to stabilize the dollar,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. The Germans, he said, feel &quot;that dollar rises aren't (sufficiently) supported by fundamentals and sustainable in the long run; they don't want it to go up only to collapse.&quot;    Mr. Bauer of Commerzbank said that had it not been for central-bank dollar selling in the past three weeks, the U.S. currency would have stood at 1.75 marks before the release of the trade figure and climbed as high as 1.77 or 1.78 marks yesterday, two to three pfennigs higher.    Dealers said that for the first time in weeks, the market was volatile. Sterling traded in a more than 2% range between $1.7830 and $1.8220, and the dollar between 1.7225 and 1.7500 marks and 124.90 and 126.56 yen. While most of the market's attention was focused on the dollar/mark and dollar/yen exchange rates, Britain's pound also got hit hard.    &quot;What happened to sterling is exactly what happened to everything else,&quot; said Betsy S. Waters, a corporate trader at Barclays Bank in New York. &quot;In addition, there was a lot of sterling selling against the mark, and it was sold when it fell through $1.7900,&quot; an important point on charts that traders use to predict currency movements.    For the near-term, traders are bullish on the dollar but remain skeptical of its upward potential. Mr. Bianchi of Union Bank predicted the dollar would trade in a range of 1.73 to 1.78 marks. But he conceded that &quot;to pierce up through 1.77 is going to be hard; the central banks will put some sort of cap on it.&quot;    Noting that West Germany was experiencing stronger-than-expected economic growth, high money-supply expansion and a weak currency relative to those of its European trading partners, Mr. Dennis of James Capel said the Bundesbank might raise interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point -- a boost that &quot;won't trigger a world crisis with stock markets rising and would prevent the dollar from going up very much.&quot;    Moreover, he said: &quot;The more (the markets) push the dollar up, the more it's vulnerable to bad news.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for June delivery settled at $450.60 an ounce, up $1. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.    ---   Walter S.
