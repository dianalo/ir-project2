(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The space shuttle Discovery wasmoved to the launch pad Friday to be groomed for a Thanksgivingflight with a secret Defense Department payload.   Rain pelted the spaceship occasionally as it made the six-hourtrip from an assembly building on the back of a giant trackedvehicle that covered the 4.2-mile course at a maximum speed of 1mph.   Earlier in the week, lightning had forced NASA to delay therollout two days and slip the launch date one day until Nov. 20.   For security reasons, officials refused to disclose the natureof the military payload to be handled by the crew of five astonauts.   The flight will be the first of two holiday missions NASA hasscheduled to to close out the year.   If all goes according to plan, Discovery will be in space onThanksgiving and Columbia will be orbiting the earth on Christmas.   Columbia is scheduled to lift off Dec. 20 on a 10-day trip todeploy a commuinications satellite and retrieve a scientificpayload that has been orbiting for five years.   The third shuttle, Atlantis, landed at Edwards Air Force Base,Calif., on Monday after a five-day flight that dispatched theGalileo spacecraft to Jupiter. Atlantis is to be flown back hereSaturday or Sunday on top of a Boeing 747 jet liner to be readiedfor a mid-February defense department mission.</TEXT></DOC>
