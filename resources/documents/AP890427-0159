The officials, speaking at a meeting of the party'spolicy-making Central Committee, said the 20 million-member partyis in danger of losing its unity and hold on the Soviet people.   ``The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, have lost theiroptimism,'' said Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin, who lost in theMarch 26 elections. ``Various generations of people, separatesocial layers and even regions are quarrelling among themselves.''   His remarks and those of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 19other speakers dominated Pravda, the party's official newspaper.   Saikin said people were losing faith in the party, and that as aresult, party organizations ``have lost their vanguard role.'' Thiswas a striking admission that the party had failed in one of itsprimary goals, to lead Soviet society.   Remarks at Central Committees generally are kept secret, andpublication of 20 critical speeches delivered Tuesday appeared tobe an effort to show the people the leadership is hearing theircomplaints.   Admissions that perestroika, Gorbachev's 4-year-oldrestructuring program, has failed to solve many of the country'sproblems also could serve as ammunition by people fighting for moreradical reform.   Gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action atTuesday's meeting, when 74 of the Central Committee's 301 membersretired.   Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who retiredhad lost the top government or party job which entitled them tomembership. The remarks of some of those who retired were publishedThursday.   Among them was Geidar A. Aliev, the 65-year-old former partychief in Azerbaijan and a close associate of former PresidentLeonid I. Brezhnev.   News reports have accused Aliev of corruption and falsifyingrecords to show he was a war veteran. But Aliev told the CentralCommittee the accusations were untrue and came from people he hadfired in Azerbaijan for wrongdoing.   Yuri F. Solovyev, the highest ranking of the approximately threedozen party officials who lost in the elections to the Congress ofPeople's Deputies, said that despite perestroika, ``The minuseshere still significantly exceed the pluses.''   Because of the failures, said Ivan K. Polozkov, a party leaderin the Krasnodar region of southern Russia, ``the authority of theparty is falling in the eyes of the public.''   Many members feel no need to adhere to the party program andrules, and some are so despondent over the lack of recognition oftheir accomplishments that they have turned in their partymembership cards, he said.   Several other speakers painted similarly bleak pictures.   ``Today, people do not have confidence in tomorrow,'' saidVladimir I. Melnikov, the party chief of the Komi region.   ``We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is ``in areal crisis'' that Gorbachev is not fully aware of because theCentral Committee staff is ``safeguarding the general secretaryfrom the severity of the situation.''   Melnikov told the committee many party officials are so afraidof the people's wrath that they are refusing to run in the nextround of elections to the 2,250-seat parliament on May 14.   In closing remarks at the committee meeting Tuesday, Gorbachevagreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages ofhousing, consumer goods and food, but said people still have faithin the party.   ``I do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearlylosing its position in the country or that it has turned into adebating society and so on,'' Gorbachev said.   ``The party's dialogue with working people is not a weakness ormaking the Communist Party a debating society. If it is weakness toconduct a dialogue with all segments of society, then I do not knowwhat courage is.''</TEXT></DOC>
