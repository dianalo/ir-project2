Earlier this month the General Accounting Office reported monthly fees for cable television were rising much faster than inflation. In some areas, cable fees were up 291% in 23 months. The study barely had hit the table when the National Cable Television Association came out with its press release, brazenly headlined, &quot;GAO Study Confirms Reasonable Cable Rate Increases Accompanied by More and Better Programming, NCTA Asserts.&quot;    What the cable industry wants to protect is its enjoyment of a happy mix of regulation and nonregulation. In fact, it is pseudoregulated -- local governments grant cable franchises with virtual monopoly status, often to interests with good political connections, and often are not particularly rigorous in regulating them. Monthly rates for consumers have indeed been rising, boosting the market value of cable companies impressively. Cable systems now sell for well over $2,000 a subscriber, five times their value a decade ago.    Knee-jerk regulators are citing the GAO report as evidence that deregulation has failed. Absurdly, there have been cries for rate reregulation, which would take us back to the bad old days when companies had no powerful incentive to increase program choices or improve service.    The answer to pseudoregulation is not re-regulation but true deregulation. The Consumer Federation of America estimates that competition would halve monthly rates for most subscribers, saving $6 billion a year.    There are a number of effective ways to foster competition. There is, in fact, no serious technical reason for exclusive franchises. If a home can have one cable, it can have two; but given the huge capacity of fiber-optic cables, one such cable once installed could handle large amounts of TV and other traffic. The question of what services local phone companies should be allowed to offer also raises competitive issues, but at the very least they could be allowed to become common carriers for vendors of TV programming, a move that would give the phone companies further incentives to lay fiber-optic cables. A bill by Virginia Democrat Rep. Rick Boucher would let phone companies transmit competing cable systems over their fiber optics, for a fee.    That would mean more choice for consumers, and quite possibly would open up other technological frontiers. In the relatively near future fiber-optic cable offers the possibility of interractive TV, enabling viewers to select programs by telephone or computer.    One stumbling block to increased competition is the vertical integration and cross ownership in the industry. Cable systems often have demanded a stake in the channels they transmit. An entrepreneur is reluctant to start an alternative cable system if he knows that he will find it difficult to gain access to programming. Quite possibly some of the antitrust aspects of these arrangements deserve a look so it can be determined whether they act to further inhibit competition in the industry.    The larger point is that pseudoregulation is just as bad as overregulation. The savings-and-loan fiasco, where effective regulation had been neutered by politics, offers another example. If Congress wants to take the GAO report seriously -- and we suspect it will have little choice given the high public visibility involved -- it should see what it can do about opening up cable to more competition. The solution is as simple as that. </TEXT></DOC>
