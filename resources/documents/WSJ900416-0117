Current immigration rules classify acquired immunedeficiency syndrome, or AIDS, as a contagious disease. Therules block people infected with the human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), which causes AIDS, from entering the countryunless they get a waiver. A number of AIDS support groups,medical associations and foreign governments have condemnedthe U.S. policy as unnecessarily harsh, and have threatenedto boycott an international AIDS conference scheduled for SanFrancisco in June unless the law is changed.</LP><TEXT>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service announced onFriday a decision to grant special 10-day visas that willallow foreigners to attend designated scientific and otherconferences in the U.S. without having to declare on animmigration form whether they are HIV-positive. Health andHuman Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, the official chargedwith selecting the meetings eligible for the 10-day visas,said that the June AIDS conference and an August conferenceon hemophilia in Washington both qualify.   In 1987, Congress, acting on a proposal by Sen. JesseHelms (R., N.C.), added HIV to the list of contagiousdiseases to be kept out of the country. However, the federalCenters for Disease Control, part of HHS, recentlyrecommended that HIV be removed from the list because itdoesn't represent a public health threat. A bill was recentlyintroduced by Rep. Roy Rowland (D., Ga.) to allow HHS to dothat.   AIDS activists have been pressing President Bush and Dr.Sullivan to support the Rowland bill. But, so far, theadministration, apparently worried about a political backlashfrom conservatives, has refused.   The administration's reaction to pressure from AIDS groupsand even from the government's own National Commission onAIDS has been characterized by awkwardness and silence.Earlier this month, the administration flip-flopped when Rep.Rowland, a doctor, introduced his bill. At first, HHSofficials said the administration opposed the bill. Then,after meetings involving Dr. Sullivan and his staff, thedepartment announced that the administration has no positionon the bill. That continues to be the administration'sstance.   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), who supports removing HIVfrom the list of diseases that restricts entry into the U.S.,called the new visa procedure &quot;encouraging.&quot; But he urged theadministration to &quot;work with Congress to realign U.S.immigration policy with sound public health principles.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
