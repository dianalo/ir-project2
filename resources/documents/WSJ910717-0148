Lifland said during a hearing yesterday in New York.</LP><TEXT>   LTV, based in Dallas, marks its fifth year underbankruptcy-court protection today and has yet to win backingfrom any creditors for a reorganization plan it filed May 1.The sticking point in the reorganization plan, as in theentire case, is LTV's liability for a $3.1 billion shortfallin its steel unit's pension plans.   LTV's creditors have indicated that they oppose the termsof a recent settlement between the company and the federalPension Benefit Guaranty Corp. The settlement calls for thecompany to infuse $950 million in cash into three of thesteel unit's pension plans and pay the remainder of the $3.1billion in annual installments of $50 million to $60 million.   Judge Lifland asked an attorney for the pension-insuranceagency if the agency could be more flexible in negotiationswith creditors, who have been asked to accept stock in areorganized LTV in lieu of cash for their claims. Theagency's attorney told the judge she wasn't authorized to saywhether the agency would renegotiate the terms of thesettlement.   After the hearing, a spokeswoman for the pension agencysaid it &quot;has already been very flexible and has madesignificant compromises in reaching the settlement with LTV.&quot;The recent settlement, which reduces the size of the annualpayments the company would have to make to the pension plans,&quot;will mean a stronger LTV and improved equity value forcreditors,&quot; the spokeswoman said.   The pension agency also opposes the appointment of anexaminer in the case, the spokeswoman said. Judge Lifland wasasked to appoint an examiner by creditors of the parentcompany and its aerospace unit after LTV announced itsintention to sell its aerospace and defense unit to helpraise cash for the pension funds.   Before the hearing on the examiner yesterday, thecreditors and the company agreed to ask Judge Lifland todelay a decision on appointing an examiner for 60 days. Butthe judge asked the creditors and the company to report at acourt hearing on what they would expect an examiner toaccomplish in the case.   The judge also scheduled an Aug. 13 hearing on the statusof negotiations on the company's reorganization plan.</TEXT></DOC>
