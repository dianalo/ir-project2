Gorbachev's decree creating anew commercial exchange rate for the ruble created confusion andchaos Thursday in Moscow's hard-currency shops.   ``Closed for inventory,'' read a sign at the Swiss-Soviet jointventure shop Sadko.   ``Sorry, I am taking stock,'' said a counterman at the Kodakfilm shop at the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel in central Moscow. A cashierat the hotel studied a chart listing the different exchange rates.   Gorbachev introduced the new rate, which took effect Thursday,with the publication on Oct. 26 of a presidential decree settingthe value of the currency at 1.8 rubles to the dollar in commercialtransactions, nearly 70 percent lower than the official rate.   The primary goal of the new rate is to make Soviet exports morecompetitive while discouraging imports, economic officials said. Itis part of Gorbachev's program to switch from central planning to amarket-based economy in the next two years.   As of Thursday, there were three government rates, as well asthe black market price of the dollar. These were the official rateof .56 rubles, the commercial rate of 1.8 rubles and the special,or tourist, rate of 6.2 rubles. The black market rate is 20 to 25rubles to the dollar.   Ivan Ivanov, deputy chairman of the State Foreign EconomicCommission, said the three-tier system should be seen astransitional while the real value of the ruble emerges.   He described the official .56-ruble rate as ``obsolete,'' butsaid it was being kept for international currency comparisons andto protect Third World countries whose debts are in rubles.   ``Gradually, these rates will be brought together, with thedisappearance of the official and special rates. The commercialrate will become basic,'' he told the government news agencyNovosti.   But for Soviet citizens, anticipation of the new devalued rateheightened fears that rubles would be worth less and spurred rumorsthat their bank accounts would skrink in value by nearly 70percent.   In Moscow, Soviets have been swarming into the handful ofhard-currency shops over the past week and buying foreign goodsranging from basic foodstuffs to fur coats and car parts.   ``People heard rumors. They are buying everything they can gettheir hands on,'' said a cashier at the Sadko shop, a favorite ofSoviets who were given the right in August to have and spendforeign currency without explaining its source.   The rush came despite assurances the government would reimburseanyone whose holdings in bank accounts were decreased by thedevaluation.   Sadko and several hard-currency shops in major hotels wereclosed Thursday morning, ostensibly for inventory, as bookkeepersand cashiers grappled with how to handle the new ruble rates.   ``We are tripling our prices in rubles,'' said AntoninaMaksimova, Sadko's director. However, she said, customers wouldn'tfeel the difference because the hard currency price they pay isunchanged. Cash registers automatically convert the ruble prices atthe commercial rate.   At the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel ice cream shop, the manager said:``In dollars, I am charging the same as yesterday'' although theruble price is three times higher.   At other shops, cashiers said they had no instructions. ``We arecharging the old rate,'' said a register worker at Kalinka, aSoviet-Finnish joint venture. ``Nobody has told us different.''   In Helsinki, Finland, meanwhile, the Bank of Finland haltedtrade with the Soviet Union because of confusion over the newexchange rates.   Kari Holopainen, director of Soviet trade at the central bank,said the bank was not informed which of the three new rates appliedto the ``clearing ruble'' used in Finnish-Soviet trade.   ``To put it mildly, we are somewhat unsure of what is goingon,'' he said. ``In any case we have stopped all payments in theclearing-house trade with the Soviet Union for the time being.''   Since there is no official currency exchange for therank-and-file Soviet, the Gorbachev decree only affects thoseSoviet citizens possessing money earned legally abroad and bankedin the Soviet Union in the form of rubles.   None of the three ruble rates now in effect, set artificially bythe Soviet government, reflect the true worth of the currency,either to companies trading shiploads of commodities or touristsbuying souvenir matryoshka dolls.   Many companies get around the exchange rates by bartering goods,such as Pepsico Inc.'s practice of selling Pepsi Cola to the SovietUnion and taking its profits out of the country in Stolichnayavodka and other commodities.</TEXT></DOC>
