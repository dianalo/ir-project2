 Efforts to forecast the outcome of theprocurement issues in the budget probably would be futile.andP;  So here are someupdates on other points of interest.andM;The Commerce Department has announced plans to establish an industrialtechnology advisory board.andP;  The board would advise on the development andcommercialization of industrial technologies needed to increase U.S.andO;economic growth and competition.andM;The board will consist of not more than 20 members to be appointed by thesecretary of Commerce.andP;  Board members will represent various technologyinterests, including biotechnology, materials, electronics and informationtechnology, as well as the financial community and academia.andM;Interested persons may submit comments regarding establishment of the boardto Robert White, Undersecretary for Technology, U.S.andP;  Department of Commerce,Room 4824, Herbert Hoover Building, Washington, D.C.andP;  20230; tel.andO;202-377-1575.andM;The government canceled a solicitation because the bids were too high,exceeding the agency estimate by more than 25 percent.andP;  The estimate,however, was done improperly, so the government was wrong in canceling thesolicitation, the U.S.andP;  Claims Court ruled earlier this year.andM;The government gave a contractor bad legal advice, saying the contractorcould appeal the contracting officer's decision to the U.S.andP;  Claims Courtwithin one year.andP;  In fact, the contractor had no right to appeal to theclaims court.andP;  Under these circumstances, the Armed Services Board ofContract Appeals (ASBCA) agreed to hear the appeal even though it had beenfiled after the 90-day time limit on appeals to the board.andM;In another ASBCA ruling, a claim that was certified by the marketing directorof a company was held to be an improper certification because the marketingdirector did not have the overall responsibility for the contractor's affairsas required by the contract.andM;The General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals ruled that anagency properly disqualified a company whose proposal said it would be payingsalaries that were 50 percent lower than what employees currently earned.andO;The board said this was a misrepresentation and therefore excluded thecompany from competition.andM;The Federal Acquisition Regulation Councils have issued a final rule puttinginto effect the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 (PL 100-690).andP;  The rule doesnot require employers to test employees for drug use in the workplace.andP;  Therule applies only to prime contractors with contracts of $25,000 or more; itdoes not flow down to subcontractors.andP;  The rule applies to 8(a) contractors.andM;The Office of Management and Budget has published a governmentwidenon-regulatory and non-binding guide, answering questions on the carrying outof the Drug-Free Workplace Act.andP;  The main points include the following:andM;Employers are not required to establish employee assistance programs, nor toconduct any drug testing, nor to incorporate any particular component intheir drug awareness programs.andP;  Employers are required only to meet therequirements of the act in good faith, including having a policy statementand a drug awareness program.andM;Possible components of a drug awareness program include employee education,employee assistance, supervisory training and drug detection.andP;  The NationalInstitute on Drug Abuse has an employer help line (tel.andP;  800-843-4971) thathas identified several model programs and a clearing-house (tel.andO;301-468-2600) for general information on controlling alcohol and drug abuse.andO;Currently the federal government does not have an example of a model programfor a small employer.andM;The following types of contracts and orders are covered by the drug-freeworkplace requirements: federal purchases of utility services; ordersexceeding $25,000 under a basic ordering agreement; and orders expected toexceed $25,000 issued against a requirements contract or anindefinite-quantity contract.andM;Among the types of contracts not covered by the drug-free workplacerequirements are contracts for real or personal property or services notsubject to the FAR (for example, contracts for obtaining goods and servicesfor post exchanges on military bases are not covered); oil and gas leaseswith the federal government; and contracts to buy timber from the federalgovernment.andM;A company with several small contracts that when added together total $25,000or more is not subject to the drug-free workplace requirements.andP;  It issubject to the requirements only if it has at least one contract of $25,000or more.andM;Compliance will be checked as a normal part of federal contractadministration.andP;  No special enforcement procedures are established.andM;William N. Hunter, Ph.D., is a 10 year veteran of the Office of Managementand Budget, where he was director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.andP;  Heis founder of W N Hunter andamp; Associates, a Vienno, Va., management consultingfirm specializing in federal procurement policy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
