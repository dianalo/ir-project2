The government also said Communist Party committees metnationwide during the weekend to discuss how to implement ananti-corruption order. Ending official corruption was a key demandof the pro-democracy movement.   A brief report by the official Xinhua News Agency late Sundayidentified the executed men as Yu Chunting and Guo Zhenghua of thecentral city of Wuhan.   It said they killed a pregnant woman and a girl while robbing ahome during the ``turmoil'' of the student-led protests.   The government has attempted to portray the protesters as commoncriminals and has tried to link any non-political crimes committedduring the upheaval to the protesters in order to discredit them.   It reported last week that four people convicted of robbery ormurder were sentenced to death in Beijing, and they also were saidto have ``taken advantage of'' the turmoil to commit their crimes.   Dozens of executions have been reported nationwide since theprotests were crushed in June, but just 12 were of knownprotesters. Hong Kong newspapers have reported that dozens moreprotesters have been executed in secret.   Executions in China are carried out with a bullet to the back ofthe head.   In other developments, the government promised today it wouldhonor contracts signed by two leading state-owned conglomeratesthat are being shut down in an attack on corruption.   The State Administration for Industry and Commerce said twospecial teams were being formed to ``clear up the accounts'' of theKang Hua Development Corp., which is linked to senior leader DengXiaoping's son, and the China Industry and Commmerce EconomicDevelopment Corp.   It said their contract would remain valid, but did not say howthese would be carried out while the companies' books areundergoing close examination and their offices are being shut down.   The Communist Party Politburo issued a sweeping order Friday toshut down the companies and audit others as part of its mostserious attack yet on endemic corruption in the party andgovernment.   It made no specific charges against Kang Hua and China Industry,but Kang Hua was widely reported to have used its connection to acharity run by Deng's son, Deng Pufang, to evade taxes.   It also was reported engaged in profiteering of scarce goods,and the government ordered several of its offices shut down lastyear.   Local party committees nationwide met over the weekend todiscuss ways of implementing the Politburo order, the People'sDaily said.   Some were said to add further measures to the Politburo ban onpleasure trips abroad, gift-giving and banquets at the stateexpense, use of imported cars by high-ranking officials and specialfood supplies for them.   The city of Tianjin ordered its officials to stop buying orbuilding homes at government expense.   Central China's Hubei province ordered a halt to special holidaysupplies of cigarettes and liquor for officials, and saidlunchrooms for officials should be converted to serve all theirstaff.   The local government pledges contained fascinating admissions ofprivileges enjoyed by officials and not previously acknowledged.   Southwest China's Sichuan province, for example, ordered itsofficials to stop giving their children special work assignments,help them to change jobs or travel abroad to study.   The party has been preoccupied with tightening discipline sinceit used troops to drive pro-democracy protesters out of centralBeijing, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.   The popularity of the pro-democracy movement dramatized publicunhappiness with the party's leadership and wide dissatisfactionwithin its own ranks.   A People's Daily commentary on Sunday hinted that party memberscan expect expulsion not only if they took part in the protests,but for the lesser offenses of expressing support for them orfailing to criticize them.   Party members, it said, are expected to ``unwaveringly carry outthe party line ... and make one's own words and deeds strictlyconform.''   In recent years, many young Chinese have joined the party notout of Communist fervor but as career moves.</TEXT></DOC>
