Talks were held July 14-15 by U.S. and Vietnamese negotiators inHanoi on resettlement of people who were put into ``re-educationcamps'' because of ties to the United States during the VietnamWar, and a joint communique issued at the time indicated anagreement had been reached.   The official Vietnam News Agency reported Monday that Vietnam``showed its goodwill and readiness to cooperate with the U.S. sidein solving the question as soon as possible. However, thediscussions brought about no result due to the U.S. side's negativeattitude.''   ``The two sides are continuing to discuss the U.S. side'sguarantee that it shall not ... tolerate any hostile activitiesagainst Vietnam by the released re-education camp inmates when theyare resettled in the United States,'' said the report, monitored inBangkok.   ``The biggest obstacle lies in the U.S. side's refusal to set upa working group to organize the emigration to the United States ofabout 500,000 people, including relatives of the released inmates,and to oversee the execution of this commitment.''   Previous Western news reports from Hanoi have said that theemigration of 50,000 people, not 500,000, was discussed.   Details on the working group proposal were not available. TheUnited States does not extend diplomatic recognition to Vietnam andhas resisted Vietnamese attempts to establish official contact.Washington says it won't consider relations until Vietnam pulls itsmore than 100,000 troops from Cambodia.   After the talks in Hanoi, the Vietnam News Agency released thetext of a joint communique that suggested an agreement had beenreached.   The communique said Vietnam was allowing the former detainees toleave after the U.S. government gave assurances it won't encouragethem to engage in anti-Vietnam activities. It said both sides hopedthat processing of the former detainees can begin within the nextseveral months. It said they discussed ways to expediteapplications.   The talks were conducted by teams led by Vietnam's DeputyForeign Minister Tran Quang Co and Robert L. Funseth, senior deputyassistant secretary of state for refugee programs.   The United States first offered to resettle the former prisonersin 1984. U.S. interest was renewed after Vietnam's new leadershipfreed hundreds of former South Vietnam officials in 1987 and thisyear.   The North Vietnamese established the camps, which usuallycombined manual labor with ideological study, after defeatingU.S.-backed South Vietnam in 1975. The U.S. State Departmentestimates that 900,000 former U.S. government employees or SouthVietnam officials have spent time in the camps.</TEXT></DOC>
