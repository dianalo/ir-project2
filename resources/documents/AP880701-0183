SANDOK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A juvenile court's decision to return twoyoung children to a home with a ``severe and prolongued'' historyof child abuse must be reconsidered, the Minnesota Supreme Courtsaid Friday.   In a 5-2 decision, the state's high court said the child abusedocumented in 1982 ``is almost incredible'' and sent the case backto Hennepin County juvenile court for further findings.   ``The history of child abuse in the home has been both severeand prolonged,'' Associate Justice Glenn Kelley said in themajority opinion.   In 1982, the father was convicted of second-degree assault forphysical abuse against his seven children, who range in age from 8to 20. In 1983, a juvenile court judge found that he had sexuallyabused the two youngest children, court documents state.   But a juvenile court ruled last year that the two youngestchildren, who had been in foster care since 1982, should bereturned to the home anyway. The five older children had alreadyreturned to their parents, the court said.   The dissenting judges said that instead of merely studying thecase further, the courts should terminate the parents' rights tothe youngest children immediately. ``The courts have exercisedjudicial caution long enough,'' Justice Rosalie Wahl said. ``It isunconscionable to prolong these proceedings.''   According to court documents in a 1982 order taking the childrenfrom him, the father once forced several of the children to standon stools and placed a chain that had been positioned over a roofbeam around their necks as he threatened to kick the stool fromunderneath each child.   On other occasions, the father chased a child with a bowie knifeand held it to the child's throat, the documents state. He alsoonce ordered several children outside, clad only in theirnightgowns, when the wind-chill was 80 degrees below zero.   The mother also was physically abused by the father, accordingto court documents.   Friday's order stems from a July 1987 juvenile court ruling thatdenied a social services petition to terminate parental rights forthe two youngest children.   The five older children had testified at that time thatconditions in the home had improved, the court said. But the rulingnoted that the testimony ``came from children who for most of theirlives had been physically abused by their father and who hadthemselves never volunteered to report the continued abuse.''</TEXT></DOC>
