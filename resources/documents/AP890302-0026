SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department's annual report oninternational drug trafficking is likely to spark controversy inCongress over its praise for Mexico, which ranks as the singlelargest source for heroin entering the United States.   In a letter accompanying the report, Secretary of State James A.Baker III acknowledged on Wednesday that the worldwide battleagainst narcotics ``is clearly not being won'' and might even be``slipping backwards.''   The report serves as President Bush's annual update for Congresson global drug trafficking.   In contrast to last year's report, which said corruption in theMexican government was ``endemic,'' this year's lauded U.S.-Mexicancooperation and points to increased drug seizures and arrests. Italso takes note of a new agreement on fighting drug trafficking.   Last year, the Senate voted 63-27 to punish Mexico for its lackof cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the attempt waskilled in the House. This year, Congress has 45 days to decidewhether it agrees with the president's findings.   The report lists 17 countries or territories as major narcoticsproducers or transit points, yet finds that their governments mayreceive U.S. assistance to continue the effort against illicit drugs.   Bush recommended that Burma and Laos be added to the list ofnations ineligible for U.S. aid because of their support for drugtrafficking, but the two nations don't receive any U.S. aid anyway.   Nor do the other nations on the list _ Afghanistan, Iran, Syriaand Panama _ but the action does permit the government to imposetariffs or tighten custom rules against certain imports.   Some of the report's most striking language came in the dim viewtaken by Baker on the international drug fight.   ``Both here and abroad, the international war on narcotics isclearly not being won. In fact, in some areas, we appear to beslipping backwards,'' Baker said.   Ann Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for internationalnarcotics matters, said Baker's assessment was based on worldwideincreases in marijuana, opium and coca production, as well as aworldwide increase in drug abuse.   ``These twin increases fuel ... an increase in power of drugtrafficking cartels _ and that worries us,'' said Ms. Wrobleski.   Baker noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating withthe United States, six of them ``can and must do more in the futureto end the drug trade.''   They included:   _The Bahamas, which was praised for a combined law enforcementoperation with the United States, but was cited for possiblegovernment corruption and urged to make ``stronger unilateralefforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption.''   _Bolivia, which was lauded for a ``good effort'' with its cocaeradication program, but the report said more must be done.   _Colombia, which was praised for ``strong action'' againstcocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers, but thereport noted that the country's ``judiciary remains intimidated'' bydrug traffickers.   _Mexico, which was cited for President Carlos Salinas' ``strongpublic stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of his newdeputy attorney general's office. But corruption was seen as acontinuing problem, and the nation remains the United States' topsource for heroin and its No. 2 source for marijuana.   _Paraguay, which was praised for a ``stronger commitment'' in1988, but was still termed a ``significant drug transit point andmoney laundering center.'' Former Gen. Alfredo Stroessner was oustedby a military coup in February. Although reports have surfaced thatthe new president, Andres Rodriguez, has links to thedrug-trafficking industry, the report says the department does ``notyet know'' what type of actions will be taken by his government.   _Peru, which was lauded for ``some real progress in anti-drugprograms'' but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop controleffort in the coming year.   One country, Lebanon, was certified for U.S. aid under a specialwaiver because the major drug-producing area of the country isoccupied by the Syrian military.   The other nations that were certified included Belize, Brazil,Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria,Pakistan and Thailand.</TEXT></DOC>
