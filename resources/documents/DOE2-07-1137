Exposure factors, repeat examinations, and elapsed timeto obtain diagnostic images were recorded. Three observers evaluatedthe images. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed no significantdifference in diagnostic accuracy. Subjective evaluation also revealedno overall difference in preference for angiography with the imagingplate or with the screen-film combination. Exposure factors were lowerfor imaging plate studies. No repeat imaging plate examinations wereneeded. Three (10%) of the screen-film studies were repeated becauseof overpenetration or underpenetration. Imaging plate studies required6% more time for processing than screen-film studies.</TEXT></DOC>
