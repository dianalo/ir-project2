 In the rushto cash in on integrated voice-data applications, vendors have come up withvariety of links.andP;  Each is different and proprietary, but aimed ataccomplishing the same goals.andP;  Here is a sampling:andM;* IBM's CallPath and TAS links to the Rolm 9750, CBX.andP;  Digital's CIT.andO;Digital's functional link has been available since January 1989, and supportsPBXs from Northern Telecom and British Telecom/Micom.andM;* Siemens' ACL.andP;  The Application Connectivity Link is just starting to shipin Europe, but has emerged as a key technology in IBM's strategy.andP;  NorthernTelecom's ISDN/Application Processor (ISDN/ AP).andP;  Northern is working toalign ISDN/AP with standards.andP;  It just began shipping.andM;* ATandamp;T's Adjunct Switch Application Interface (ASAI).andP;  ASAI is the mostinteresting of the proprietary functional links.andP;  It is based on the ISDNQ.931 and Q.932 transport standards, giving developers a single library ofcalls across multiple PBX architectures.andM;* NEC America's Open Application Interface (OAI).andP;  OAI is a gateway betweenNEC's NEAX2400 switches and Unix-based computers.andP;  Current applications linkNEAX2400s and NEC's own Astra XL computers.andP;  There are two major differencesbetween the available links.andP;  First, different links are based on differentphysical connectivity schemes: Some are asynchronous, some are synchronous,some are based on proprietary transport protocols and formats.andP;  Second,different links use different applications command and message protocols andformats.andP;  The important point from an applications perspective is thatdiversity in link architectures mitigates against easy portability ofapplications integrating PBX and computer platforms.andP;  There is, however, hopeon the horizon that standards on two levels will soon pave the way forportability.andP;  ISDN Q.931/932.andP;  The first bit of good news is that the CCITT'sQ.931 and Q.932 standards are nearing completion.andP;  These standards define theprotocols and formats needed to use ISDN to link telephones and otherterminal equipment to PBXs.andP;  ATandamp;T's ASAI is based on early versions of thestandards.andP;  These standards are important in the long term because they offera consistent way to interface PBXs and terminal equipment, giving usersfreedom to mix and match equipment.andP;  This is an advantage over proprietarylinks like Rolm's Rolmlink.andP;  But it's unlikely that users will move wholesalefrom their current proprietary products to ISDN.andP;  The cost of installing newinterface cards alone mitigates against such a move.andM;COMPUTER SUPPORTED TELEPHONY APPLICATIONandM;(CSTA).andP;  By the end of next month, the first of three stages in the EuropeanComputer Manufacturer's Association (ECMA) process to develop a CSTA openfunctional PBX-computer interface should be complete.andP;  The ECMA Task Group 11will first issue a technical report describing CSTA's architecture, andfollow within a year with a draft standard.andP;  CSTA has such wide backing thatit appears a cinch to sail through approval by ECMA, and become the basis ofa CCITT and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard.andO;Active participants in TG-11 include IBM, Digital, Siemens, ATandamp;T, NorthernTelecom, Hewlett-Packard, Philips, Ericcson, Mitel, and others.andP;  Missing fromthe active group is NEC.andP;  NEC's absence is the lone cause for concern aboutthe industry's adoption of CSTA.andM;CSTA flew through the ECMA committee's process in the space of 13 months, anindication of how badly vendors want a standard interface and of howattractive the CSTA architecture is to them.andP;  The initial CSTA work is basedon a &quot;proxy&quot; approach to achieving independence from switch architectures.andO;The proxy design assumes that CSTA services are performed on behalf of aparticular party on a call.andP;  IBM proposed a &quot;symmetric&quot; approach that callsfor independent manipulation of each connection in a call.andP;  The issue is thecontrolling point of the call.andP;  In the proxy approach, the caller directs theaction.andP;  In the symmetric approach, either the caller or a database can bethe controlling factor.andP;  Even though the TG-11 is proceeding with a proxyapproach first, IBM's favored approach is still on the table.andM;CSTA will become a base set of services.andP;  Each of the vendors that hascommitted to incorporate it plans to offer a superset of CSTA.andP;  Their addedvalue, then, will be in providing services that CSTA doesn't define.andP;  Asadditional services become commonplace, they will be added to CSTA.andP;  IBMbelieves the first CSTA document addresses only a portion of the neededfunction.andP;  There's plenty of room for growth.andP;  In its first version, CSTAaddresses PBXcomputer application integration.andP;  Future versions will addinterfaces to services on the public network.andM;In the latest draft of TG-11's technical document available at press time,the following services were identified: !!!Begin TableandM;Telephony ServicesandM;Make_Call  Clear_CallandM;Clear_Device  Hold_CallandM;Retrieve_Call  Consultation_CallandM;Alternate_Call  Reconnect_CallandM;Transfer_Call  Conference_CallandM;Pickup_Call  Answer_CallandM;Make_Predictive_CallandM;Status Reporting ServicesandM;Snapshot  MonitorandM;Value service  Value query serviceandM;Bidirectional ServicesandM;Escape serviceandM;Computing ServicesandM;Call-routing  Database accessandM;Non-Call-Related ServicesandM;a.andP;
