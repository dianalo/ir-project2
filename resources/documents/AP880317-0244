Banking analyst Herb Jones of the investment firm Eppler, Guerinandamp; Turner says Texans used to brag that everything in the state wasbigger, better, the best.   ``We can't say that now. We look at the Northeast and see theirgrowth is far superior to ours. That was never supposed tohappen,'' Jones said Wednesday.   As the state's largest bank-holding company seeks federalrescue, the nation's perception of Texas has become more negative,analysts say.   Dallas-based First RepublicBank Corp., with $33.2 billion indeposits and 134 banking facilities statewide, acknowledged Tuesdayit was seeking federal help because of a deteriorating loanportfolio and difficulty in raising deposits.   Gerald W. Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officer,said a loss of $1 billion in deposits since the beginning ofFebruary contributed to the bank's decision.   There are signs the state's battered economy is rebounding andthat the energy industry is revitalizing, but analysts say thebanking industry still lags, coping with mistakes made one to threeyears ago and the continuing troubles in real estate.   ``Real estate is still a real thorn here,'' Jones said. ``Iexpect some further weakness in the real estate sector.''   Also hurting the state's image are the bankruptcy courtpetitions of such Texas notables as former Gov. John Connally, whowas U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Nixon; Connally'slieutenant governor, Ben Barnes; oil heir Cullen Davis of FortWorth; famed heart surgeon Denton Cooley; some businesses of thebillionaire Hunt brothers; former Dallas Cowboys owner ClintMurchison; and the Western Co. of North America, owned by TexasRangers owner Eddie Chiles.   The number of Texas bank failures, meanwhile, continues soaring,nearly doubling from 26 in 1986 to 50 in 1987, and stands at 15 sofar this year.   ``We do have some other banks that are in trouble. I have noreason to think we've hit the bottom of the problem. There couldstill be some more (banks) to be heard from,'' Jones said.   Staggering losses continue at other banks _ with the state'sseven largest bank-holding companies losing a combined $2.6 billionlast year. By contrast, all Texas banks lost $883.2 million in 1986.   Regulators also say more than one-third of the state's 281savings and loan institutions are insolvent. The FBI and the U.S.Justice Department are in the midst of a criminal investigation ofsome of the state's thrifts, called the largest white-collar probein the Southwest's history.   Tuesday, Houston-based First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc.extended its deadline for debt holders to redeem their securitiesat a discount under a rescue plan representing the second-largestbank bailout in U.S. history.   Jones said he believes a major financial institution will comeinto Texas and take over First RepublicBank, if the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. makes it an attractive deal.   ``It's a very desirable institution, at a price,'' Jones said.``A lot of worms are in there still. Will the FDIC pick them up?That's the question. I think they will. They're going to have to.''   First RepublicBank's plea for federal aid is a ``bittersweetstory,'' said Alan Coleman, director of the Southwestern GraduateSchool of Banking at Southern Methodist University.   The good news is that new capital will be brought into thestate, along with new faces and new investors. But the bad news, hesaid, is that ``it's very tough on the people struggling with theproblems here.''</TEXT></DOC>
