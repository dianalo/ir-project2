SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most of the Americans who will greet the 21stcentury are already alive, a group far different from theirancestors who welcomed the arrival of the 1900s, population analystssaid Thursday.   During the 20th century, the nation's population has grown tounprecedented numbers, people moved south and west, and there havebeen major shifts in family life and in the status of women.   The 21st century is still about a dozen years away but, from apopulation perspective, the future is now.   ``Over 80 percent of the people who will make up the populationof the United States in the year 2000 are now alive,'' said a newstudy by the private Population Reference Bureau.   The elderly of the 21st century are already well into theirlifespans and the first high school class of the next century is nowin the elementary grades, the independent bureau added in a studyreleased Thursday: ``America in the 21st Century: A DemographicOverview.''   At the same time, the Census Bureau issued its ``PopulationProfile of the United States 1989,'' looking at the country'scurrent population status.   The aging of America is likely the most discussed and documentedtrend, with 29.8 million elderly in the country as of 1987, 12.2percent of the population, and two-thirds of the group being women,the Census Bureau reported.   The agency said that this group will continue growing into thenext century, jumping to one American in five when the massivepost-World War II Baby Boom generation hits senior-citizen status byabout the year 2030.   That will critically impact health care and retirement incomeprograms, said the Population Reference Bureau study.   There will be a relative scarcity of young people to takeentry-level jobs, school enrollment could shrink and employers willface a different mix of potential workers.   Retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity,said the private group, and there may become a need to easeimmigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from othercountries.   The ``traditional'' family of working husband while the wifestays home with the children has disappeared from the scene.   Under half of all families have children, and even in familiesthat have offspring the majority of mothers held jobs outside thehome as of 1987, the Census Bureau reported.   At the same time, the Population Reference Bureau said that ``thegrowing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled anenormous increase in single-parent families.''   Currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent,compared with one in 10 in 1960, the private group said.   ``The growing concern over child care, elder care and parentalleave will continue well into next century,'' the group added.   Rapidly growing black and Hispanic populations have alsoattracted attention in recent years, with the Census Bureaureporting that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent of Americans whileHispanics make up 8 percent _ meaning that, although there is someoverlap, these two groups now include nearly one in five Americans.   ``By 2000, nearly one-third of all school-age children will befrom minority populations,'' the Population Reference Bureaureported.   The decline in birth rates in recent years means that the growthin the labor force will slacken, but an anticipated ``shortage'' ofworkers in the next century will be one of the types of employeesavailable, not the total number, the private group said.   ``Jobs of the future will demand a moderate to high level ofeducation and training, compared with jobs of the past,'' the groupadded, and business concerns will center on the potential mismatchbetween worker skills and job requirements.</TEXT></DOC>
