(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The City Council has voted to banownership of handguns by most residents, making this the fifthChicago suburb to impose firearms restrictions.   Councilwoman Margie Weiss said the council ``will be sending astrong message to Springfield and Washington: Highland Park istired of waiting for them to act.''   The ban was approved by a 5-2 vote Monday.   This affluent community of 33,000 north of Chicago is one townaway from the suburb of Winnetka, where 30-year-old Laurie Dannentered a school last May and fatally shot one child and injuredfive others. Later she injured a man and killed herself.   The ordinance, which takes effect May 1, bans possession ofhandguns except by police officers and security guards, members oflicensed gun clubs and firearm collectors ``whose possession islimited to antique firearms.''   The ordinance allows people to voluntarily turn over handguns tothe police without penalty.   A first offense carries a fine of $50 to $500. Police also willconfiscate and destroy the offender's gun.   ``I'll probably turn my gun in,'' said resident Larry Leviton.``If I have an incident in my home where I can't defend myself,I'll sue the city.''   Wilmette, a suburb which borders Winnetka, approved a ban on thesale and possession of handguns last month. Three other Chicagosuburbs _ Morton Grove, Evanston, Oak Park _ also have bannedhandguns.   A referendum to ban handguns will be held April 4 in Winnetka.</TEXT></DOC>
