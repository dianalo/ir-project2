The Federal Communications Commission on Monday ordered fivecompanies that provide so-called alternative operator service toprovide more consumer information. The FCC also told those companiesthey must not block callers from using other long-distance carriers,the FCC said.   However, the FCC decided not to regulate alternative operatorservice rates, which have caused numerous complaints from thosemaking collect or credit card calls who sometimes get a big surprisewhen they receive their bill later at home.   The FCC action was in response to a complaint filed by twoconsumer groups, Telecommunications Research and Action Center andConsumer Action, against Central Corp., International TelechargeInc., National Telephone Services Inc., Payline Systems Inc. andTelesphere Network Inc.   Providers of alternative operator services typically lease linesfrom a long-distance carrier and then provide their own operators toconnect callers with that long-distance company. Businesses that usethe alternative operator services for their pay phones get acommission from each call.   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said theFCC had ordered the companies to:   _Provide information on or near the telephone that an operatorcall will go through a certain company and indicate how to contactthat company for rate information.   _Make their operators identify what company they are with andthen give callers an opportunity to hang up without any charge.   _Refrain from call blocking, in which a hotel, for example, willplace all its long-distance calls through a particular operator. Thealternative operator services companies cannot prevent callers fromusing ATandamp;T, for example, if they choose to do so.   Brock said an industry panel also will be asked how to solve theproblem of ``call splashing,'' in which an alternative operatorservices provider uses an operator in Denver, for example, to handlea call from Los Angeles to New York. If the caller decides not touse that operator, the operator will hand off the call to anotherlong-distance operator in Denver and the caller will get a bill fora call from Denver to New York instead of Los Angeles to New York.   But Brock said the commission would allow the marketplace to setrates.   ``We believe that we are not the appropriate ones to limit theconsumer options,'' Brock said. ``So long as the consumers have achoice, then we assume that they will choose the carrier that is ofmost value to them, given the combination of service characteristicsand prices charged. ... A consumer who believes that an AOScompany's rates are too high should use a different carrier.''   Brock said Monday's ruling is separate from a recent decision bya federal judge that owners of buildings where public phones arelocated must choose by April 1 which company will providelong-distance service.</TEXT></DOC>
