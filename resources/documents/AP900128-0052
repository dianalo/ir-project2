(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An avalanche prompted officials to closethe Jackson Hole Ski Resort Sunday, but no one was injured,officials said.   The resort was closed for the day after the avalanche at 1:10p.m. in an area called the Headwall, said Mike McCollister,director of operations.   About 50 searchers with tracking dogs sifted through the snowfor three hours and determined no one had been trapped, resortofficials said. The area was to reopen Monday.   The avalanche began in a spot that is out of bounds for skiers,he said. It reached an area that is in bounds, but isn't aregularly marked ski trail.   Ski patrols routinely set off explosions near potentialavalanche slopes early in the morning to clear dangerously loosesnow before the resort opens to the public.   ``Sometimes avalanche control is not an exact science,''McCollister said. ``You do the best you can and you work hard atit, but sometimes this happens with a lot of snow, a lot ofbuildup.''</TEXT></DOC>
