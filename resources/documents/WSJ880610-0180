Kuwait also said that during the inquiry its agency wouldn't seek representation on the board of BP, wouldn't request an extraordinary general meeting of BP shareholders and wouldn't purchase any assets of BP &quot;except in the ordinary course of business.&quot;    Lord Young, Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry, announced May 4 his decision to refer the Kuwaiti stake in BP to the panel to decide whether it was against the British public's interest. The commission was asked to report its findings within four months. The Kuwaiti agency has said all along that it is only interested in the BP stake as a long-term investment and hasn't given any indication that it plans to make a bid for all of BP or request representation on BP's board. </TEXT></DOC>
