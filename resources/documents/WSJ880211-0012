Commuters for Fair Treatment recently filed suit in New York State Supreme Court, charging the Metropolitan Transportation Authority with violating their rights by abolishing smoking cars on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad.    The smokers' rights group is being funded by Philip Morris USA, which recommended a top lawyer and is picking up the battle's legal fees, a spokesman said.    &quot;We were contacted by people who smoke our products and ride these trains,&quot; he added.    The commuter group also requested a restraining order against the MTA to halt the smoking ban, which begins Monday. Instead, a state supreme court justice suggested that the MTA refrain from issuing summonses -- which can carry fines of as much as $100 -- until the next hearing on the matter, set for Feb. 25.    A spokesman for the MTA, which oversees the rail lines, said, &quot;We're going to leave it up to the railroads on how they're going to go about (enforcing) it.&quot; But he added that getting a summons for smoking on the train &quot;isn't out of the question.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
