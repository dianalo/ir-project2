Winston R. Wallin, chairman and chief executive officer, also said he expects the therapeutic medical devices maker to post record annual sales and earnings in fiscal 1988, which ends April 30. He cited continued brisk sales of the Activitrax model rate-responsive pacemaker.    In fiscal 1987 the company earned $73.8 million, or $5.25 a share, on sales of $502 million. In last year's first quarter, the company earned $17.8 million, or $1.25 a share, on sales of $116.2 million.    Medtronic also expects to make at least one acquisition in the blood-flow management market before January, Mr. Wallin said.    &quot;We're looking for products developed by companies where patents are for sale,&quot; he said. &quot;Our objective is to get the products however we can.&quot;    While Medtronic expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve domestic sale of its own balloon angioplasty catheter late this year, the company is looking at laser-catheter technology as well, Mr. Wallin said.    Other products under development include a tachycardia device that would combat unsynchronized quivering of the heart, or fibrillation. Trials of that device will begin soon, Mr. Wallin said.    Medtronic's recent $3 million settlement with the government to reimburse Medicare for replacement of defective pacemaker leads won't affect earnings because the sum is covered by product liability insurance and a previously established reserve, Mr. Wallin said. </TEXT></DOC>
