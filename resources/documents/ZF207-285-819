(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Polaroid PalettePlus Polaroid ushered in a new era in home photography whenit realized that quick, cheap, and easy was more important to many peoplethan high quality.andP;  It's not surprising that it has had a good deal ofsuccess in bringing this same approach to computer-generated photography withthe Polaroid Palette.andP;  Since its release in 1983, the Palette has garneredthe support of more than 35 graphics packages, making it one of the mostwidely supported film recorders on the market.andP;  The Polroid Palette--and itsenhanced implementation, the Polaroid PalettePlus--produce lower-qualityoutput than do other film recorders.andP;  But at $2,999, the price is lower too,making in-house computer-generated slides and prints a reality for those withlimited budgets.andM;A key element of the PalettePlus's success is its simplicity.andP;  Connecting thecables, installing the camera, and loading the film are straightforwardprocesses.andP;  There's even a setup demo disk that guides you through unpackingand setting up the equipment step by step, giving you on-screen illustrationsof how to hook up all cables.andP;  This should help technophobes feel more atease.andP;  The demo covers only the installation of the 669 film camera (used tocreate self-developing prints and transparencies), though, and ignores the35mm camera.andM;The PalettePlus is an analog film recorder and so works by intercepting thesignal sent to your monitor and generating photographs from it.andP;  (It is theonly analog film recorder we review here.)andP;  This means the resolution of yourmonitor limits the output resolution.andP;  The PalettePlus can fill in the areasbetween raster lines to increase the resolution on CGA systems to 640 by 400,and it boosts the resolution on EGA systems to 640 by 700.andP;  But it stillfalls well short of the 2K or 4K horizontal resolutions standard with digitalfilm recorders.andM;With an EGA system, you're limited to 16 colors in a single picture, althoughfour different color palettes allow 72 available colors altogether.andM;You can send images to the PalettePlus directly from your graphics package,selecting all options such as film type and exposure from within the package.andO;Or you can use the controller software to call up graphics files saved todisk in the correct format.andP;  The program lets you preview the pictureon-screen and alter the colors if you wish.andP;  You can also alter camerasettings and then send files to the camera one at a time or in batches.andM;If you should ever want film output from a graphics package that doesn'tsupport the PalettePlus, you can turn to the memory-resident screen-grabberutility included with the film recorder.andP;  Once this utility is loaded inmemory, you can start your graphics program (or any other type of software)and work with it normally.andP;  When you have a screen ready to save, a two-keycombination calls up the screen-grabber menu.andP;  This lets you send the imageto the PalettePlus, to your printer, or to a disk file.andP;  You can even editeach color individually, with the changes shown immediately on-screen.andP;  Theresolution of any resulting photographs will be the same as than of yourmonitor.andM;The PalettePlus comes with a pack film back for exposing Type 669 instantcolor print or Type 691 mini-overhead film for producing prints andtransparencies and a 35mm camera for creating slides.andP;  Neither camera has aviewfinder, and the 35mm camera has no setting controls or film advancebutton.andP;  This makes for less flexibility but also means there's no danger ofinadvertently setting the camera controls incorrectly.andP;  However, the 35mmcamera does have automatic film loading, advancing, and rewinding.andP;  Andswitching from one camera to the other is quite a simple matter.andP;  Polaroidalso offers an optional CB33 camera back for exposing AutoFilm Type 339 filmfor about $300.andP;  Type 339 film self-develops in normal room light without anyneed for peeling or timing.andM;You also get a Polaroid 35mm Power-Processor for developing Polaroid instantslide film and a Polaroid 35mm illuminated slide mounter.andP;  This means that ifyou use the included PolaChrome slide film, you can go from graphics fileson-disk to finished slides in a matter of minutes--without the need for aprofessional developer.andP;  But, Polaroid admits that you should use Kodak'sEktachrome ASA/ISO 100 for best-quality output rather than its own PolaChromefilm.andM;As one might expect from a relatively low-resolution film recorder such asthe Polaroid PalettePlus, text and outlines of shapes tend to be jagged.andP;  ThePalettePlus often compensates for its limited number of colors by resortingto fill patterns instead of solid colors.andP;  This gave the maroon background ofour GRAPH1 test slide a washed-out appearance and made much of GRAPH2 appeargrainy.andP;  On the positive side, it reproduced shapes quite accurately andapproximted the original colors fairly well within its limitations.andP;  It evengave a reasonable rendering of continuously gradated background colors.andM;The Polaroid PalettePlus can't compete with digital film recorders when itcomes to output quality, but for ease of installation and ease of use itcan't be beat.andP;  The huge number of graphics packages that support it, thescreen-grabber program, and the equipment supplied for developing your ownslides and prints offer certain advantages.andP;  If price is a barrier and thesethings concern you more than high-quality output, then the PalettePlus mayappeal to you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
