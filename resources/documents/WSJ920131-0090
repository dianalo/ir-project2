Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, thestate in which I live, Connecticut, may be allowed tocontinue to ship its low-level waste to other states fordisposal. Speaking as a citizen of a state that uses (andwastes) more energy than most states, I want to go on recordas saying I am opposed to shipping our waste to other states.   I just took an inventory of the electrical appliances andgadgets my wife, Donna, and I have in our house. We have fivetelevision sets, seven radios, two stereos, a personalcomputer, an electric toothbrush, a refrigerator, a washingmachine, a dryer, a microwave oven, a garbage disposal, twofans, 10 lamps and an electric can opener.</LP><TEXT>   Where does the electricity that feeds these householdmonsters come from? Much of it is generated by the state ofConnecticut's Millstone nuclear plants, the same power plantsthat will be the source of the waste that will feed anothermonster looming on the state's horizon: a low-level hazardouswaste dump slated for a yet-to-be-named community.   Three towns have already been selected by the ConnecticutHazardous Waste Management Service as possible sites for thecontroversial dump. As of this writing, the community inwhich my wife and I live has not been named as a possiblesite. But I would like to offer my town, at least a smallpart of it, as a possible dump site. What parcel of land am Ioffering?   My back yard.   I know this offer may not sit well with my neighbors,though it does sit well with my wife. The neighborhood inwhich my wife and I live is near the town's hallowedhistorical district. The homes that line Main Street are bigand white and well cared for. The lawns are spacious whitecarpets on which tow-headed children and golden retrieversfrolic in the winter sun. Why am I recommending that alow-level radioactive waste dump be dumped on a paradise likethis?   The answer is simple: I have reached a point on life'schart where the line representing what I have consumed and amconsuming meets the line of personal responsibility. I havethought long and hard about this issue. I have listened toboth sides of the debate. On one side are those who opposebuilding the dump anywhere near where they live. On the otherside are those on whose shoulders the responsibility forgetting rid of the waste rests. As I have listened to bothsides argue, as I have read what each side has to say (orshout), I have come to the conclusion that this is where Istand on this issue.   I stand smack dab in the middle of the acre and a half ofland behind my home in Suffield, Conn. Let the groundbreakingbegin. This is where the waste should be dumped.   How much waste should be buried in my back yard? Base theamount to be buried on the amount of electricity my wife andI use. Take that figure and factor in the space we haveavailable in our back yard. Then start shipping our fairshare of low-level waste to us immediately.   This plan isn't just a plan for Connecticut. It will workin any state in the U.S. People all over the country, peoplejust like us, have been demanding more electricity everyyear. More power plants have been built to meet ourincreasing needs. The electricity is ours. The waste is, too.That's why I say, start burying it here, in my back yard.Yes, in MY back yard.   ---   Mr. McCarthy is a counselor in the psychiatry departmentof Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
