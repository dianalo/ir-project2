The video pictures of particle tracks seen througha microscope are digitized and analyzed in real time by MC 68000 microprocessors.In this paper we present some new developments: The picture analysissoftware is extended to separate overlapping tracks and to measure ellipticaltracks even if these are flawed by surface structures. A software autofocus,a faster hardware version based on the contrast and a modified commerciallaser autofocus are now available. A new picture analysis system basedon the faster 32-bit microprocessor MC 68020 will operate on two picturesof 1024 x 1024 pixels resident in memory together. This will allow threedimensional track measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
