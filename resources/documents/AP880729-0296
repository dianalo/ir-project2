The sale would have helped British construction magnate BrianBeazer finance his $1.8 billion purchase of Koppers. Beazer said hewas optimistic other buyers could be found for the chemicalsbusiness.   The announcement came a day after sources said that recentconcerns about the chemical segment's environmental liabilitieswere jeopardizing the agreement for Beazer to sell the operationsto managers and their outside partner.   Beazer and his takeover partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.and a British bank, had agreed to remain responsible for theenvironmental liabilities after the leveraged buyout.   Beazer expressed confidence Friday that a sale can be arrangedwith other parties.   ``We have received a number of inquiries relating to thistransaction over a period of several months,'' he said by telephonefrom Koppers headquarters in Pittsburgh. ``We have not pursuedthose inquiries because of our undertaking to give exclusivity tothe management group. It is our intention to seek purchasers of aserious nature immediately, and that is already under way. We donot expect any difficulty.''   Beazer gave the managers the exclusive right to negotiate forthe business. The managers will now have to compete with outsidebidders if they are to salvage their plan.   Asked what killed the management-led buyout, Beazer told ThePittsburgh Press ``you should ask Gordon Cain. We have a signedcontract and are prepared to honor it.''   Cain, head of The Sterling Group of Houston, is a chemicalsindustry financier. He was an equity partner with the Koppersmanagers and was announced as the chairman of the new KoppersChemical Co.   Cain's office on Friday referred all questions to Koppers.   Glen C. Tenley, the Koppers president and chief operatingofficer who was to become president and chief executive of KoppersChemical, was out of his office Friday and not expected back untilMonday, a secretary said.   Beazer said Thursday that discussions were continuing, in anapparent last-ditch effort to save the chemicals buyout.   After bitter resistance in federal court, Koppers' former topmanagement conceded defeat and agreed June 1 to sell the companyfor $61 per share to Beazer and Shearon Lehman Hutton.   Beazer wanted Koppers in order to add its construction materialsbusiness to his international construction operations.   The ousted management estimated the chemical segment'senvironmental liabilities as $200 million over the next decade.</TEXT></DOC>
