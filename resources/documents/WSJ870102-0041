The Income Contingency Loan program, currently a $5 million experimental project at 10 colleges, would get more than $600 million under the Education Department's budget request for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. That level of funding would provide 500,000 loans at 1,500 schools, according to Bruce Carnes, deputy undersecretary.    &quot;This program is unsubsidized,&quot; Mr. Carnes said, comparing the program to others in which some interest is subsidized, but repayment schedules are fixed. &quot;The students will pay the full cost of the money.&quot;    Separately, administration officials said the Labor Department's new budget, which goes to Capitol Hill on Monday, will propose that the current funding level -- about $650 million -- for the Job Corps program be maintained.    In the past, the administration has tried to terminate or sharply reduce the Labor Department program, which provides remedial education, job-skills training and room and board in residential centers to disadvantaged youths. The $650 million funding level would pay for about 40,500 training slots.    Under the Income Contingency Loan Program, the rate of repayment for student loans is based on a borrower's after-college income. For borrowers with lower incomes, payments would be stretched over a longer period. As a result, their total payments probably will be greater than for students with higher incomes, because they would generate more interest charges.    &quot;We're very excited about this program,&quot; Mr. Carnes said. &quot;We think it is the single biggest advance (in student aid) in the last 15 years.&quot;    Mr. Carnes said &quot;student aid programs are essentially out of control&quot; because college costs are rising rapidly. Almost half of all U.S. college students receive some form of federal financial assistance.    For the current fiscal year, the department requested $90 million for the Income Contingency Loan Program. Mr. Carnes said Congress provided only $5 million because it preferred funding grant and subsidized loan programs during an election year.    But he said he expects lawmakers to approve more generous funding for the program this year, because it won't be a congressional campaign season, and because the non-subsidy nature of the program makes it more attractive for the government than other college loans or outright grants.    Under the administration's proposal, eligible students -- those who meet certain income guidelines -- would be able to borrow $4,000 for each of the first two years and $5,000 for each succeeding year of undergraduate study. They could borrow a total of $50,000 during their entire undergraduate and graduate years.    Repayment would begin nine months after a recipient ceases to be at least a half-time student, and could be stretched over a period as long as 30 years. But a financial hardship deferment of as long as three years could be given to those in special circumstances.    The interest rate on the loans would be the Treasury bill rate plus three percentage points, and payments couldn't exceed 15% of a borrower's annual income.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Cathy Trost. </TEXT></DOC>
