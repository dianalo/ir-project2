 Please write to The Editorat 1 0 Barley Mow Passage, Cbiswick, London W4 4PH Unlessyour letter ismarkedNotForPublication it will be consideredandM;for inclusion on tbispage.andP;  Dear.EXE, We were very pleased to see ourproduct, Protec, mentioned in your feature on data and software security inthe November issue of EXE.andP;  However, we were a little less plea:ed with yourinaccurate comments regarding the product, especially the author's allegedbreak-in at i securitv conference.andP;  First, the author of the article saidthat Protec does not trap Int 13h calls, and that consequently the hard diskwas totally open to any software that uses Int 13h calls.andP;  As we all know,Int 13h is a ROM-based routine and it is impossible for anv software to trapLhese calls, except using special features of the 386 in protected mode.andP;  Theauthor also stated that he had used Norton's Disk Doctor to crack the Protecsecuritv and unlock the hard disk.andP;  This is misleajing.andP;  Using NDD trashedthe disk's file allocation table FAT), allowing a program that uses Int 13hto directly read sectors from the disk.andP;  This is not the same as disablingthe securitv, in my opinion.andP;  You mentioned tfiat Clam, a competing product,protected itself from Int 13h programs by providing encrv tion, and vouandM;p stated that Protec did not.andP;  This is not true.andP;  Protec also has anencryption facility as standard, but we had not enabled it because theconference organisers had told us not to.andP;  I do not understand whv Clam'sencryption was turned on.andM;PaulMcKibbinandM;Intmwtional Data Sec aly, Robert Schifreen replies: First,apologiesforparapbrayingyour let ter, Paul.andP;  Asyou sent it to me, itwouldbave filled oter 2 pages in EKE, and we simply didn't have tbe space.andO;Howeter, I bope that I bave repeated all  ?f our concems.andP;  seculliyconference at wbicb I usedNDD to break Protec was indeed one organised tbeIBM PC User Group.andP;  I wassbo  a desk, on ubich were 2 machines One wasprotected 19, Protec, a  tbe other by Clam.andP;  I wasgit,en no manuals, and noclues.andP;  NDD did, asyou say, trasb tbe disk'sFAT, andthis bypassedtheinitialprotection.andP;  Icouldth bootfrom afloppy disk and use an Int 13h call toread tbe bard disk.andP;  I was not infonned tbat Protec bad an encryptionfeatureand, became Clam's was clearly enabled, I assumed that Protec lacked such afacili(y.andP;  I'm sony if I gave tbe wrong impre,gsion, but I belieted at thetime that tbe person ubo had set up Protec had insta all tbe options.andM;Altbough I do not dtspute tbatyou asked not to install tbeenctyptionfacili(V, am vety, surprised tbatyour representatite, wbo waswatcbing me tbroughout, did no raise this matter.andP;  As soon as I had tbeinitial secuhty, be sulked in a corn andgai,e tbe impression that be wasadmit ting defeat If, as you sqy, Protec bad s cient extrafeatures to bavekept me out, would like to hatye been told.andM;I undeistand that afeiv users bave t Nonon Disk Doctor on tbeir own Protecprotected machines, and tbatyou bave to engage in vanous circuitous routesretilet,e tbeir FATS.andP;  I bope tbat publicisi tbe situation in EXF,, as yourletter done, u,illprevent this bappening again.andP;  Dear.EXE, I read withinterest the article in December's issue, entitied  The Thinking Programmer'sGuide to UARTS', having recently been involved in programming for realtimedata capture via the PC serial port.andP;  There is, however, one point in thearticle which contradicts the information that I have on the 8250 chip.andM;in Figure 5, a note at the bottom states that National Semiconductorrecommend that the Line Status Register is not written to.andP;  However, one ofthe advertised features of the 8250 is the ability to read and write all thecontrol and s tus registers.andP;  Mv Nat Semi datasheet for the 8250, inreferring to the Data Ready bit (bit 0 of the Line Status Register) actuallysavs that bit 0  may be reset to a logic 0 either hy the CPU reading the datain the receive buffer, or I)v writing a logic zero into it'.andP;  The ability todo this can be very useful.andM;It is quite possihle for the receive buffer register to contain an unwantedcharacter, when a peripheral has been connected or powered up.andP;  As soon as aninterrupt routine is established and enabled, this character will cause aninstant interrupt and will be read bv the routine.andP;  To prevent this, it issimpler to invalidate the character by resetting the Data Ready bit in theLine Status Register, rather than read and discard the character.andP;  I do thisin mv own programs, and have had no problems so far.andM;john KcutgenandM;London NW10 Dear Sir, I feel it would be beneficial if I clarifv 2 pointsthat were made in the December issue of.EXE, First, SideKick@for PresentationManager will run under OS/2 1.1, and not solelv under 1.2 as vour news storvsuggestei.andP;  The use of the new facilities in OS/2 1.2 will not affectdownward compatibility.andM;Second, in regard to your letter about Turbo Basic from Mr Duffin.andP;  Owing tothe dynamic nature of strings in Turbo Basic, a descriptor must be maintainedfor each string.andP;  For faster reference, this descriptor is stored within thedata segment, thus VARSEG and VARPTR will refer to the data segment and notthe string segment.andP;  I have enclosed a short routine which extracts thecorrect location of the string segment from the data segment, which will showMr Duffin how to do what he was trying to achieve.andM;Maubew PriceandM;Senior Tecbnical Support AnalystandM;Borland international,  UK) Ltd Robert Schifireen replies: We bave Manbetvssbon BASIC program onfile, Anyone wbo would like a copy can c,all tbe.EXEoffice, sendan SAE or leave us a Fax number.andP;  Dear.EXE, In your Decemberissue, you ask for an accurate and succinct' definition of the term'realtime'.andP;  I thinkyouhavefalleninto a trap which is all too often encountered bypeople in this industry.andP;  Because we are used to dealing with the precise anddeterministic nature of computers, we expect that the rest of the worldshould exhibit these characteristics.andP;  I feel that your question is ratherlike asking for an accurate and succinct definition of the colour green !andP;  Ofcourse we can all come up widi a description of the colour green, egsomewhere between yellow and blue in the visible spectrum, but this is not adefinition.andM;So, do I have a description of real time? Yes, of course.andP;  It depends on theconcept of the value of information generated by the system.andP;  In most cases,this value tends to fall as time progresses, ie as the information becomesolder and staler.andP;  If this value could be quantified, then in some cases wewould see a fairly linear fall, while in others we might see something whichstarted off fairly flat but, at some point, started to decline rapidly.andM;Three examples come to mind.andP;  First, a system which is generating a naturallanguage dictionary.andP;  Tbe value of this system's output does not decline overthe time it takes to produce the document, regardless of whether theproduction process lasts an hour or a week.andM;Second, a system which is monitoring a patient's respiratory rate.andP;  This verysuddenly loses value if it cannot detect and notify a significant pausequickly enough.andM;Finally, a weather forecasting system.andP;  This is useless if it cannot producea forecast for the next day within 24 hours, and it is progressively morevaluable as that time decreases.andM;So which of these are real time systems? I think that the answer to thatquestion depends not only on the application, but also on the supportingtechnology, so we describe a real time system as one where it is technicallydifficult to achieve the system's outputs within the time period where thoseoutputs retain their value, or retain suffi'cient of their value to warrantusing the system.andP;  Of course, this line of thought means that what is a realtime system today may not be one tomorrow, assuming that the systemrequirements stay the same.andP;  Weather forecasting systems of yesteryear might,by this description, have been real time systems in their day but, if therequirements for accuracy and reliability had not changed, they would not beso considered today.andM;BernardNonbmoreandM;Science Systenzs LtdandM;Brandamp;ol Dear.EXE I write in response to a letter in November's issue from LindaAllen, regarding the ability of the ANSI.SYS driver to redefine keys on a PC.andM;I produce commercial software that not only uses ANSI, but does (on occasion)redefine keys.andP;  The use of colour, cursor movement and general screen controlis much easier with ANSI, than having to use BIOS calls.andM;I admit that it is possible for a practical joker, and the more sadistic inthe profession, to redefine keys using ANSI so that they do much more nastythings.andP;  I myself have been on the receiving end of such pranks.andP;  However,since I work in an environment dealing with a lot of users' software (sent asbackups for diagnostics), which I have to restore to my PC, there are severalprecautions that I take.andM;The first is to test for viruses using IBM's virus detection software, plus afew other utilities that I have collected.andP;  The second is to look forfilenames that I don't recognise.andP;  The major fail-safe, of course, and theone that we should all take, is to keep regular backups.andM;You can, with a language like C or Pascal, write a little program that looksfor ANSI escape sequences and gives you a list of files to avoid if you can'trisk it, or look at with an editor.andP;  The point is, though, that I rarely findanything that is either malicious or even just plain daft.andP;  Vendors ofrespectable software will not do nasty things to redefine keys, althougherrors may occur that do end up fatal.andM;The onus is on the user not to acquire dodgy' software and, if they must, totake precautions.andM;Greg LontaxandM;Keuill-Xetal, Systenis LtdandM;Salford Robert Schifreen replies: Of course, as you say, it is up to uwn tokeep regular b&quot;&quot;s.andP;  H  the nzajority of usm do not do this, wbicb avlains wbya bandful of people in tbe UK can make a fairly good lu,7ng by recovmng dataft-om dandamp;andamp; wbicb sbould bave been backed up in thefirstplace Unfo?lunately,the number of uays of ac,quiring  dodgv'softuare are numerous Tbere are terisof thousands of PC progdJhrants bulletin boards around tbe uorld, all ofwbicb are avat4ablefor tbepnce of a pbone call Thankfully, tbe current anissr,are bas not stopped tbe udting and disftwion of tbese very usefulpteces ofsoft u,are.andP;

 For a start, there are no installation problems  because there's noinstallation!).andP;  Also, with no operating system on the disk, there's a full360K (or 1.2 MB) of space for the program and its data.andP;  Is there an easy wayto do this?andM;jobn PticerandM;Wa6ford Robert Schifreen repties: Tbere's aprogram on iolume 2 of tbe.EXE Dzandamp;called NODOS 7bis unll create a bootable copy of aprogramforyou, on a 360K or1.2 MBfloppy.andP;

 Dear Robert, I have the need to insertcharacters into the keyboard stream of a PC, under the control of a hardwareinterrupt handler.andP;  This is to supply keystrokes to an application packagefrom external hardware or from the actual keyboard in parallel.andM;Currently, the characters (plus scan codes) are placed into the bufferdirectly by my interrupt routine.andP;  This works fine, except with programs likeSideKick that grab interrupt 9, the hardware keyboard interrupt, for some oftheir input.andP;  For example, my TSR is unable to pop-up SideKick, because it isSideKick's own Int 9 handler that looks for the activation code, and my ISRnever sees it.andM;Can I load a scan code directly into the hardware register on the keyboardthat Int 9 reads? I seem to remember reading somewhere that the AT-stylekeyboard controller is programmable - could it be instructed to send aspecified scan code, and do you know where details of such information may befound?

Dear Robert, Welldone! Your editorial in November' issue (how to listen to cellphone callsaffirms the validity of the defence to infamous Prestel hacking charge of ayears ago.andP;  it also reminds me of the origin al Wireless Telegraphy Actwhich, recog nising that it is impossible to stop peopl listening in toradio, had to be content with forbidding the use of any infon-nation therebygained (which is another impossible thing to monitor in all but a few cases).andM;Those who urge the banning of eavesdropping (probably the best term todescribe the deliberate, or accidental, act of listening in) sometimes likenit to opening and reading someone else's mail.andP;  I would describe it as anatural and harmless activity such as opening and reading a book which hasbeen left lying around.andM;The best defence against security leaks is to assume that you have nodefence.andM;Daffl Tait Robert Schifireen rcplies:  Dorking My editonal regarding tbe easewitb wbtcb it is possible to listen in to cellpbone calls gmaated more re&quot;nsetban almost anytbing else I bave uviuenfor.andP;  EXE during my 2 yea?s here Anumber of large co nipanies, including one of tbe cleanng banks, called toask permission to band round pbotocopies of tbe article to all tbeir mobilestaff lfjust one or tuo people bave taken notice of wbat I wrote, and stoppedgiting out s&quot;-user paandamp;uwrds over the air, then I uill bave acbkwd wbat I setout to do.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
