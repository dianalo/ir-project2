Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission,widening its investigation of the Treasury securities market,has unleashed a new wave of subpoenas targeting individualgovernment-bond traders on Wall Street.                                                                                                          In a series of rapid-fire blows yesterday, the World Bank-- one of the world's biggest bond market players -- theMassachusetts state treasurer and the state of California allsuspended doing business with the battered investment bank.   The British Treasury is considering shutting out theSalomon Inc. unit as an underwriter from the Britishgovernment's proposed sale of its big stake in BritishTelecom PLC. And another Salomon client, Mercury AssetManagement Group PLC, one of Britain's biggest investmentfunds, said Salomon used Mercury's name in bidding at recentauctions of U.S. Treasury notes without its authorization.   &quot;Some institutions are looking to punish us,&quot; a Salomonexecutive said. After Salomon installed new management andadmitted violating Treasury rules, &quot;it blows us away thatsome people are saying: `You may not be good enough for us,'&quot;the executive said.   Salomon could be badly wounded if client defectionssnowball. At the very least, the client moves severely hobblethe firm's recovery from the worst scandal in its 81yearhistory.   Salomon, for its part, said it &quot;respects&quot; the decisions ofits defecting customers. But a spokesman said the firm hopesthe clients will give Salomon &quot;favorable consideration aftera full review of the extraordinary steps taken by newmanagement of Salomon.&quot;   Salomon has admitted to repeatedly violating bidding rulesat multibillion dollar Treasury note auctions. The firm'sthree senior officers -- John Gutfreund, chairman; ThomasStrauss, president; and John Meriwether, vice chairman --resigned after admitting they knew of one unauthorized bidmade by Salomon at a February Treasury-note auction, butdidn't report it to the government for months. New managementtook over Sunday.   The Salomon scandal has triggered a widespreadinvestigation of the government securities market by the SEC,Justice and Treasury Departments and the Federal Reserve.Now, a new wave of SEC subpoenas, sent out in the last twodays, seeks documents, and in some cases, testimony, fromindividual bond traders, according to individuals withknowledge of the investigation. They said traders at SalomonBrothers, which is at the center of the growingTreasury-auction scandal, have been by far the largestrecipient of such subpoenas.   But one individual with knowledge of the matter said that&quot;employees of a lot of the primary dealers&quot; that participatein the Treasury's multibillion-dollar note auctions canexpect to receive subpoenas, if they haven't already. In someinstances, individuals famliar with the investigation said,individuals had been asked for the same records as had beensought in subpoenas to their employers.   The government official said that by making similarrequests to individuals, the SEC is seeking to ensure that itwon't miss any trading records or other relevant documents.   While the SEC is seeking to speak with employees ofSalomon and other dealers, the official said that thisdoesn't mean these individuals are suspected of wrongdoing.Instead, individual testimony will help the SEC to betterunderstand how the Treasury markets operate.   The SEC began sending subpoenas on Friday to most of the40 primary dealers, the large commercial and investment banksthat are authorized to trade Treasury securities directlywith the Federal Reserve and that agree to bid regularly atTreasury auctions.   Despite the latest customer defections, Salomon still hasmanaged to keep the bulk of its clients. For instance, threebig pension funds -- the $10 billion Retirement Systems ofAlabama, the $21.8 billion Ohio Public Employees RetirementSystem and the $84.4 billion Teachers Insurance and AnnuityAssociation-College Retirement Equities Fund, or TIAA-CREF --all said they planned to continue doing business withSalomon.   But yesterday's blows followed two other big funds thathave already suspended their Treasury-bond business withSalomon. As previously reported, the $63 billion CaliforniaPublic Employees Retirement System said it wouldn't tradegovernment securities with Salomon, and the $26 billionWisconsin Investment Board suspended all business with theinvestment bank until questions about the auction violationsare resolved.   Yesterday, the World Bank suspended all business withSalomon but said it would review its decision Sept. 30. Thesuspension would have been indefinite had Salomon not takenrecent actions to change management and beef up internalcontrols, the World Bank said. It added that it will resumebusiness ties with Salomon if a review &quot;indicates that youonce again meet the high standards we set for our financialpartners.&quot;   Salomon said in a statement that it &quot;would like toapologize to the World Bank and its member governments forany embarrassment caused by our actions. We will continue toensure that all necessary corrective measures are implementedpromptly.&quot;   Meanwhile, Massachusetts State Treasurer Joseph Maloneindefinitely suspended all securities trading with Salomon bythe $5.8 billion Massachusetts State Teachers EmployeesRetirement System and the $3.1 billion Pension ReservesInvestment Trust.   Mr. Malone said the suspension takes effect immediatelyand will last until he has received assurances from Salomonthat necessary controls have been put in place that willprevent future securitieslaw violations. Still, Mr. Malonesaid he was encouraged by the initial steps Salomon hastaken, including the new role of investor Warren Buffett, whotook over as Salomon's interim chairman and chief executiveSunday.   The California State Treasurer's Office, meantime, said itwon't renew the $230 million of Salomon commercial paper --short-term IOUs -- it now owns. And the office suspended allother business with Salomon in the state's $19 billion pooledmoney investment account.   As for the British Telecom offering, a Salomon spokesmansaid the investment bank is confident that &quot;there is noproblem with that business.&quot;   The British government review &quot;is entirely reasonable&quot;given recent events, the spokesman said, adding, however,that &quot;we don't expect anything bad to happen.&quot; He saidSalomon hadn't yet been summoned by the British Treasury fora meeting, but &quot;we are prepared to answer any questions thatthey may have.&quot; The British Treasury declined to confirm ordeny whether a review is under way.   A negative decision by British authorities would be a blowto Salomon. Although Salomon is known principally as a bondtrading powerhouse, the firm has been attempting to move moreaggressively into the stock underwriting market in recentyears.   The British government's remaining 48% stake in BritishTelecom, the telecommunications giant, is valued at about $5billion; Salomon last month had been named as leadunderwriter for the U.S. portion of the offering, scheduledto begin in November.   Salomon's spokesman insisted that the bond scandal hasn'tmaterially affected Salomon's other activities in London.&quot;Business has held up very well,&quot; he said. &quot;Our clientsunderstand that what happened was terrible . . . but theyalso know that it's not something that touches the otherparts of our business.&quot;   Mercury Asset Management, a major British institutionalinvestor, identified itself as one of two firms whose namesSalomon admits it used without authorization to submit bidson U.S. Treasury notes. In an Aug. 9 news release, Salomonsaid it had submitted such unauthorized bids at threeseparate Treasury auctions; it didn't name the firms.   Mercury Asset said &quot;this use was not authorized&quot; and bidsin its name &quot;were made without its knowledge.&quot; The concern,75%-owned by S.G. Warburg Group PLC, the big Britishinvestment banking concern, added that it was providing &quot;allrelevant information&quot; to U.S. authorities to &quot;assist theirinvestigations.&quot;   Mercury Asset has substantial U.S. investments. Aspokesman declined to say whether Mercury intends to continuedealing with Salomon in the Treasury market. &quot;There's been nodecision about how to participate in auctions in the future,&quot;the spokesman said.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
