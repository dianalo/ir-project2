I agree with theplurality that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals tointerpret the second sentence of (the Missouri statute) ... asmeaning that ``doctors must perform tests to find gestational age,fetal weight and lung maturity.'' ...   Unlike the plurality, I do not understand these viability testingrequirements to conflict with any of the court's past decisionsconcerning state regulation of abortion. ...   It is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinationsand tests useful to determining whether a fetus is viable, whenviability is possible, and when it would not be medically imprudentto do so, does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortiondecision. ...   Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted (theMissouri statute) ... and because, properly interpreted, (thestatute) ... is not inconsistent with any of this court's priorprecedents, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Excerpts from Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Brennan and</NOTE><TEXT>   Justice Marshall join, concurring in part and dissenting in part:   Today, Roe vs. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and the fundamentalconstitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate apregnancy, survive, but are not secure. Although the courtextricates itself from this case without making a single, evenincremental change in the law of abortion, the plurality and JusticeScalia would overrule Roe ... and would return to the statesvirtually unfettered authority to control the quintessentiallyintimate, personal and life-directing decision whether to carry afetus to term.   Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and thedecisions of this court prohibit a state from enacting laws thatinhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, aplurality of this court implicitly invites every state legislatureto enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order toprovoke more and more test cases, in the hope that sometime down theline, the court will return the law of procreative freedom to thesevere limitations that generally prevailed in this country beforeJan. 22, 1973.   Never in my memory has a plurality announced a judgment of thiscourt that so foments disregard for the law and for our standingdecisions.   Nor, in my memory, has a plurality gone about its business insuch a deceptive fashion. At every level of its review, from itseffort to read the real meaning out of the Missouri statute, to itsintended evisceration of precedents and its deafening silence aboutthe constitutional protections that it would jettison, the pluralityobscures the portent of its analysis.   With feigned restraint, the plurality announces that its analysisleaves Roe ``undisturbed,'' albeit ``modified and narrowed.'' Butthis disclaimer is totally meaningless. The plurality opinion isfilled with winks and nods, and knowing glances to those who woulddo away with Roe explicitly, but turns a stone face to anyone insearch of what the plurality conceives as the scope of a woman'sright under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy freefrom the coercive and brooding influence of the State.   The simple truth is that Roe would not survive the plurality'sanalysis, and that the plurality provides no substitute for Roe'sprotective umbrella. I fear for the future. I fear for the libertyand equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of agein the 16 years since Roe was decided. I fear for the integrity of,and public esteem for, this court.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
