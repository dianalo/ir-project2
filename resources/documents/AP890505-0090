There was no immmediate confirmation a third West German wasbeing held, and West German television said the Bonn government wasskeptical anyone was seized.   ``We are still trying to find the facts,'' said West GermanAmbassador Wolfgang Gottelman. In West Germany, Foreign Ministryspokesman Hanns Schumacher said the two West German relief workerswho reappeared ``disappeared for a certain period of time and thensuddenly reappeared'' last year as well.   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia said in a statement thatHeinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler were released at 5 a.m., 10hours after being abducted, and drove to their office between thePalestinian refugee camps of Ein El-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh, near thesouthern port of Sidon.   A Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security at thebase where the two work said the West Germans ``told me that thekidnappers are keeping their colleague Marcus Michael ... inconnection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi.   ``There were three when they left yesterday evening. Only two ofthem returned today,'' said the Palestinian, 1st Lt. Maarouf, whouses only one name.   Hamadi is a Lebanese Shiite Moslem on trial in Frankfurt, WestGermany, on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking ofa TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.   Neither Struebig, a 48-year-old administrator, nor Ms.Schnitzler, a 26-year-old nurse, would speak to reporters aftertheir arrival in Sidon. They hid their faces from photographers.   The commander of the PLO's military police in Sidon, Lt. Col.Wajih Abu Ali, said this was because they feared for theircolleague.   ``The released two told me they are scared because thekidnappers have threatened to kill their third colleague if theyrevealed any information about their abduction,'' said Abu Ali.   Maarouf did not say if any demands had been made.   Maarouf said he saw Struebig, Ms. Schnitzler and Michael leavein a car together Thursday.   Abu Ali said that based on his investigation, five gunmen in acar intercepted the relief workers' van on the southern edge ofSidon late Thursday, forced them into the car and ``sped awaytoward the south.''   Abu Ali said Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler were released in theZahrani area, six miles south of Sidon. He said they jumped into ataxi that drove them to their base.   In Sidon, the two met for 10 minutes with Mustafa Saad, whoheads the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which is dominant inSidon. After that they were whisked out to waiting cars. Reportersand photographers were not allowed into Saad's residence to coverthe meeting.   Earlier, the militia's press officer, who identified himselfonly as Ghassan, said his militia and the mainstream Shiite MoslemAmal militia carried out ``nightlong efforts to locate the kidnapvictims. This cooperation led to their quick release.''   The Syrian-backed Amal militia, led by Nabih Berri, controlsmost of south Lebanon. Ghassan refused to identify the allegedkidnappers.   In West Germany, the ARD television network said the governmentbelieves it ``peculiar'' that on April 6, 1988, the same two peopledisappeared under similar circumstances and reappeared a short timelater.   At that time, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to havebeen kidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group forwhich they work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage.   It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with theirdisappearance apologized to the two after discovering theiridentities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in thearea.   ``The federal government obviously has doubts whether the twoactually were victims of a kidnapping,'' ARD said after Schumacher,the Foreign Ministry spokesman, noted the 1988 incident. Schumacheralso said the government had no information about Michael.   Abu Ali said Michael, 25, arrived in Lebanon eight days ago. Healso works for Asma-Humanitas, which has six employees in southLebanon.   There are 15 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   In January 1987, two West Germans _ Rudolf Cordes and AlfredSchmidt _ were kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut in an effort to winfreedom for Hamadi, who had been arrested in Frankfurt a short timeearlier.   Both were eventually released. A pro-Iranian group, HolyWarriors for Freedom, claimed responsibility for the abductions andsaid the releases were a ``good will gesture'' to win a lenientsentence for Hamadi, who faces life in prison.   Hamadi's elder brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted in WestGermany of those kidnappings.</TEXT></DOC>
