Specifically, the regulations specifyrequirements for protecting and promoting patient rights; training andcompetency of home health aides; notifying State entities responsible forthe licensing or certification of HHAs of changes in ownership of the agencyor management of the agency; including an individual's plan of care aspart of the individuals' clinical records; and operating and furnishingservices in compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local laws andregulations and with accepted professional standards and principles thatapply to professionals furnishing home health services. Most of the provisions of these regulations implement section 930 of theOmnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-499), section 4021 of theOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203), and section411(d) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360).These regulations also implement, in part, a proposed rule that was publishedon December 31, 1986 (51 FR 47266) to reduce the information collectionand recordkeeping requirements for the conditions of participation forHHAs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2><T3> Effective date:</T3> These regulations are effective on July 1, 1989and, except as otherwise provided, apply to services furnished by homehealth agencies after June 30, 1989. The requirement that HHAs establisha competency evaluation program for home health aides (andSection; 484.36(b))is not effective until February 14, 1990, because we recognize that thedelay in the promulgation of this interim final rule, without an extensionin the effective date, would impose an unacceptable burden on home healthagencies and State survey agencies. The requirement that an HHA may onlyuse as a home health aide an individual who has successfully completeda training and competency evaluation program or a competency evaluationprogram as provided in andSection; 484.36 is effective for home health aideservices furnished after August 14, 1990.

General Legislative Background </ITAG>Home health services are furnished to the elderly and disabled under Medicare.They include an array of services such as professional nursing care, physicaland occupational therapy, speech pathology, medical social services, homehealth aide services, and medical supplies and equipment. These servicesare delivered singly, or in combination, to aid in the recovery from anacute illness or to improve a patient's health status.The Medicare statute limits payment for home health services to providersof services who have qualified for a Medicare provider agreement as a homehealth agency (HHA). HHAs must meet all State and local licensure requirementsas well as the Medicare conditions of participation. These conditions ofparticipation apply to an HHA as an entity. In addition, as indicated insection 4021 of Public Law 100-203, they also apply to each individualunder the care of the HHA, unless a condition is specifically limited toMedicare beneficiaries.Currently, there are about 5,680 HHAs participating in the Medicare program.The majority of HHAs are visiting nurse associations, other charitableorganizations, and State and local public health departments, which hadbeen furnishing home health services to the public before the enactmentof Medicare in 1965. With the provision of Medicare financing for theseservices, several new types of providers entered the home health servicesfield. These new providers include private nonprofit agencies that areorganized and operated by individuals, but which have achieved and maintaineda tax-exempt status; and proprietary agencies that are privately owned,profit-making agencies.The growth in the number of HHAs participating in the Medicare programhas resulted in the practice of some HHAs hiring personnel who have noprior training or experience in caring for the medical needs of the agedand disabled. Congress found this situation to be particularly prevalentin the case of those HHAs that do not directly employ home health aides,but contract out for those services, sometimes with personnel agenciesthat supply general temporary help. (See H.R. Rep. No. 1167, 96th Cong.,2d Sess. 369 (1980).) Section 930(l) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Actof 1980 (Pub. L. 96-499), amended section 1861(m)(4) of the Social SecurityAct (the Act) by modifying the previous definition of the home health benefitthat covers services furnished by a home health aide. As amended, section1861(m)(4) of the Act requires that for Medicare to cover home health aideservices, home health aides, whether employed directly by an HHA or madeavailable through contract with another entity, must successfully completea training program approved by the Secretary.On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub.L. 100-203) was enacted. Section 4021(a) of Public Law 100-203 amendedsection 1861(o)(6) of the Act by requiring that HHAs meet the conditionsof participation specified in section 1891(a) of the Act that was addedby section 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203. As added, section 1891(a) requiresan HHA to meet the following conditions: andbullet; Protect and promote the rights of each individual under its care.andbullet; Notify the State entity responsible for the licensing or certificationof the agency of a change in ownership, and management of the agency. andbullet; After December 31, 1989, use as a home health aide only individualswho have been determined to be competent to furnish home health aide care.andbullet; Use individuals that meet minimum training standards establishedby the Secretary to use or demonstrate durable medical equipment. andbullet; Include an individual's plan of care required under section 1861(m)of the Act as part of the individual's clinical records described in section1861(o)(3) of the Act (currently appears as a condition of participationin 42 CFR 405.1228). andbullet; Operate and furnish services in compliance with all applicableFederal, State, and local laws and regulations (including the requirementsof section 1124 of the Act) and with accepted professional standards andprinciples that apply to professionals furnishing services in an HHA (currentlyappears as a condition of participation in 42 CFR 405.1220). Section 1891(a)(3)(D)(i) of the Act requires the Secretary to establishminimun standards for home health aide training and competency evaluationprograms by October 1, 1988. Section 1891(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to assure that the conditionsof participation and requirements specified in or in accordance with sections1861(o) and 1891(a) of the Act and the enforcement of these conditionsand requirements are adequate to protect the health and safety of individualsunder the care of an HHA and to promote the effective and efficient useof public moneys. Section 4039(g) of Public Law 100-203 authorizes the Secretary to issueregulations (on an interim or other basis) as may be necessary to implementthe provisions of section 4021 of Public Law 100-203.  On July 1, 1988, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Actof 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360). Section 411(d) of Public Law 100-360 amendedsection 4021 of Public Law 100-203 by_ andbullet; Including physical or occupational therapy assistants in the definitionof a licensed health professional; and andbullet; Removing from section 1891 of the Act the training standards forthe demonstration and use of durable medical equipment and imposing thesestandards as coverage requirements in section 1861(n) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Redesignation Table for 42 CFR Part 405, Subpart L</ITAG>In addition to the other provisions of this regulation, we have redesignatedthe conditions of participation for HHAs (42 CFR Part 405, Subpart L) asnew Part 484. In the preamble to this rule, we refer to the redesignatedsections (that is, Part 484) in our discussions of the regulation changes.We have provided below a table for cross-referencing the old and new sections.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10.2</C> <H1>Old section</H1><H1>New section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1201<D>484.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1202<D>484.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1220<D>484.10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1221<D>484.12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1222<D>484.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1223<D>484.16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1224<D>484.30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1225<D>484.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1226<D>484.34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1227<D>484.36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1228<D>484.48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1229<D>484.52</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">405.1230<D>484.40</D></ITAG></ITAG>Additionally, we are consolidating the changes to the conditions of participationfor HHAs made by section 4021 of Pub. L. 100-203 in this final rule withcomment period because we believe that it will be less confusing than theissuance of several different final rules on the conditions of participationfor HHAs. The changes for the reduction of information collection and recordkeepingrequirements made in response to the proposed rule of December 31, 1986,however, are not subject to formal public comment. We are requesting publiccomment only on the changes made in response to the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Recent Statutory Provisions and Implementing Regulation Requirements</ITAG>A. Patient Rights RequirementsSection 1891(a)(1) of the Act, as added by section 4021(b) of Pub. L. 100-203,specifies the conditions of participation regarding patient rights thatHHAs must meet. HHAs must protect and promote the rights of each individualunder their care, including each of the following rights: andbullet; The right to be fully informed in advance about the care and treatmentto be furnished by the HHA, to be fully informed in advance of any changesin the care or treatment to be furnished by the agency that may affectthe individual's well-being, and (except with respect to an individualdetermined to be incompetent) to participate in planning care and treatmentor changes in care or treatment. andbullet; The right to voice grievances without discrimination or reprisalfor voicing grievances with respect to treatment or care that is (or failsto be) furnished.andbullet; The right to confidentiality of the clinical records describedin section 1861(o)(3) of the Act. andbullet; The right to have one's property treated with respect. andbullet; The right to be fully informed orally and in writing (in advanceof coming under the care of the agency) of:<ITAG tagnum="14">All items and services furnished by (or under arrangements with) theagency for which payment may be made under Medicare; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The coverage available for items and services under Medicare, Medicaid,and any other Federal program of which the agency is reasonably aware;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Any charges for items and services not covered under Medicare andany charges the individual may have to pay regarding items and servicesfurnished by (or under arrangements with) the agency; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Any changes in the charges or items and services for which the individualmay be liable. </ITAG>andbullet; The right to be fully informed in writing (in advance of comingunder the care of the agency) of the individual's rights and obligationsunder Medicare. andbullet; The right to be fully informed of the availability of the StateHHA hotline established under section 1864(a) of the Act. 1. <T3>Standard:</T3> Providing notice of rights and documenting observance.We will require HHAs to_ andbullet; Provide patients with written notice of their rights under thiscondition of participation in advance of furnishing care to patients orduring the initial evaluation visit but before treatment is given (andSection;484.10(a)(1)). andbullet; Maintain documentation that shows that they have complied withtheir obligations to notify patients of their rights (andSection; 484.10(a)(2)).This reguirement is necessary so that State surveyors will be able to determineif HHAs are complying with these requirements. 2. <T3>Standard:</T3> Exercise of rights and respect for property. The regulations_ andbullet; Specify that patients have the right to exercise their rightsas patients of HHAs (andSection; 484.10(b)(1)). andbullet; Permit a patient's family or guardian to exercise the patient'srights when a patient has been judged incompetent (andSection; 484.10(b)(2)).The Report of the Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives thataccompanied Pub L. 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress, lst Session411 (1987)) indicates that it is the intent of Congress that a patient'sfamily or guardian be permitted to exercise his or her rights if the patientis judged incompetent.andbullet; Specify that patients have the right to have their property treatedwith respect (andSection; 484.10(b)(3)). andbullet; Provide patients the right to voice grievances regarding treatmentor care that is (or fails to be) furnished, or regarding the lack of respectfor property by anyone who is furnishing services on behalf of an HHA withoutdiscrimination or reprisal for doing so (andSection; 484.10(b)(4)). andbullet; Require HHAs to investigate complaints made by a patient or thepatient's family or guardian regarding treatment or care that is (or failsto be) furnished, or regarding the lack of respect for a patient's propertyby anyone furnishing services on behalf of the HHA. HHAs also must documentboth the existence of complaints and resolutions (andSection; 484.10(b)(5)).We believe that it is the intent of Congress that HHAs both protect patientsfrom retribution if they voice grievances about the care being furnishedby an agency (or an entity under arrangement with an agency), and act toresolve any complaints lodged by patients about their care, or treatmentof property. The Report of the Committee on the Budget, House of Representativesthat accompanied Public Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress,1st Session 412 (1987)) indicates that Congress believes that patientsshould be encouraged to voice their opinions on quality of care issues,as a means of ensuring the delivery of quality home health services. Congressalso intended to place the responsibility for ensuring patients' rightsto have their property treated with respect on HHAs furnishing services.Hence it appears that Congress intended that HHAs be responsible for resolvingcomplaints made by patients regarding care and treatment or a lack of respectfor a patient's property by someone furnishing services on behalf of anHHA. 3. <T3>Standard: </T3>Right to be informed and to participate in planningcare and treatment.The regulations_ andbullet; Provide that patients have the right to be informed orally andin writing in advance about the care and treatment to be furnished, andto be informed in advance of any changes in the care and treatment to befurnished (andSection; 484.10(c)(1)). andbullet; Require HHAs to advise patients, in advance of furnishing treatmentor services, of the disciplines that will furnish care, and the frequencyof visits proposed to be furnished (andSection; 484.10(c)(1)(i)). We believethat this requirement meets the intent of Congress as expressed in thecommittee report language. Specifically, the Report of the Committee onthe Budget, House of Representatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203(H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress, 1st Session 411 (1987)) indicates withrespect to the beneficiary's right to receive a full and complete explanationof care and treatment to be delivered, that: ``Such an explanation is to be provided by the HHA with whom a beneficiaryhas contracted for services and is to be given before treatment is scheduledto begin and before any recommended changes in care are put into place.It is the Committee's intent that an adequate explanation to a beneficiaryinclude, at a minimum, a description of the services to be provided, aproposed service delivery schedule, and a discussion of any options thatmay be available for an alternative course of action that is in compliancewith the physician's plan of care but may better meet the specific needsof the individual. andbullet; Require HHAs to advise patients of any planned changes to thecare or treatment being furnished before the changes occur (andSection; 484.10(c)(1)(ii)).We believe that this requirement also is intended by the Congress to beincluded in these regulations as evidenced by the previous cited committeelanguage. andbullet; Specify that patients have the right to be informed, before receivingcare or treatment that they may participate in the planning of care ortreatment and that HHAs must advise patients of that right. The regulationalso permits patients to participate in planning changes in care or treatment(andSection; 484.10(c)(2)). 4. <T3>Standard: </T3>Confidentiality of medical records. The regulations_ andbullet; Specify that patients have the right to confidentiality of theclinical records maintained by HHAs (andSection; 484.10(d)). andbullet; Require that HHAs advise patients of an agency's policies andprocedures regarding disclosure cf clinical records (andSection; 484.10(d)).5. <T3>Standard: </T3>Notification of liability for payment. The regulations specify that patients have the right to be advised, andthat HHAs must advise patients_ andbullet; Orally and in writing of the extent to which payment can be expectedto be made for items or services to be furnished to patients by Medicare,Medicaid, and any other program in the State that is funded all or in partwith Federal funds of which an HHA is reasonably aware (andSection; 484.10(e)(1)).andbullet; Orally and in writing of the amount of charges for items and servicesthat an HHA expects will not be covered by Medicare and the amount of anycharges the individual may have to pay regarding services furnished by(or under arrangements with) an HHA (andSection; 484.10(e)(2)). andbullet; Of any changes that occur in the information provided to patientsunder this standard as soon as possible but no later than 15 working daysafter an HHA becomes aware of a change (andSection; 484.10(e)(3)). Whilesection 1891(a)(1)(E)(iv) of the Act requires that patients be informedof any changes in the charges for services, we are specifically requiringthat notice of changes be made within 15 days since we believe that thattimeframe is reasonable for HHAs to meet. We considered providing a longertimeframe for notification of changes. However, we were concerned thata longer timeframe would increase the potential beneficiary liability forcharges that the patient had previously been advised would be covered.A longer timeframe also might increase significantly the liability of apatient for charges that may be increased after the patient's start ofcare (for example, a general increase in charges for all patients thatoccurs after the initial notice of charges). We also considered imposingno timeframe. However, this alternative also would have increased the potentialof patient liability since agencies would be able to delay advising patientsof changes indefinitely. We request specific public comment on this timeframe.6. <T3>Standard: </T3>State home health hotline. The regulations specify that all patients have the right to be advisedof the number of the HHA hotline in the State and require that at the timeHHAs accept patients for treatment or care, HHAs must advise patients inwriting of the telephone number of the HHA hotline established by the State,the hours of its operation, and its purpose (andSection; 484.10(f)). Whilesection 1891(a)(1)(G) of the Act specifies that patients have the rightto be informed of the availability of the State HHA hotline, the Reportof the Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives that accompaniedPublic Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress, 1st Session 414(1987)) states ``that agencies inform beneficiaries of the availabilityof the hotline, including the actual number of the hotline and the hoursduring which it is in service. Agencies should also explain the purposeof the hotline so that beneficiaries can make appropriate use of it.''B. Home Health Aide Training and Competency Requirements Section 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203, adds section 1891(a)(3) to the Actand specifies that_ andbullet; Beginning January 1, 1990, HHAs must not use as home health aides(on a full-time, temporary, per diem, or other basis), individuals to furnishhome health services, unless the individuals have completed a trainingand competency evaluation program or a competency evaluation program, thatmeets the minimum standards established by the Secretary under 1891(a)(3)(D)of the Act, and are competent to furnish home health services. If the individualhas not been employed as a home health aide for a continuous period of24 consecutive months since completing a program, then the individual isnot considered to have completed either a training and competency evaluationprogram, or a competency evaluation program (sections 1891(a)(3) (A) and(C)). andbullet; HHAs must provide a competency evaluation program and necessarypreparation for home health aides employed as of July 1, 1989 to completethe program by January 1, 1990 (section 1891(a)(3)(B)(i)). andbullet; HHAs must provide regular performance reviews and in-service educationto assure the competency of home health aides (section 1891(a)(3)(B)(ii)).andbullet; The Secretary must establish minimum standards for training andcompetency evaluation programs by October 1, 1988, that address the contentof the curriculum, minimum hours of training, qualification of instructors,and procedures for determination of competency (sections 1891(a)(3)(D)(i) and (ii)). The standards may permit approval of programs offered byor in HHAs (if they have not been out of compliance with any conditionof participation in the last two years), as well as outside agencies (includingemployee organizations), and of programs in effect on December 22, 1987,which met the standards established by the Secretary (section 1891(a)(3)(D)(iii)).Individuals completing a training and competency evaluation program beforeJuly 1, 1989 will be deemed to have completed a program approved by theSecretary if the Secretary determines that the program meets the Secretary'sstandards (section 1891(a)(3)(D)(iv)).1. <T3>Definition of ``home health aide''. </T3>We have revised andSection;484.4 to define the term ``home health aide'' as any individual who hassuccessfully completed a training program that meets the requirements ofandSection; 484.36(a) and a competency evaluation program that meets therequirements of andSection; 484.36(b), or a competency evaluation programthat meets the requirements of andSection; 484.36(b). We believe that Congressintended that to function as a home health aide, an individual must meetthe requirements of section 1891(a)(3) of the Act.Section 1891(a)(3) of the Act states specifically, that a ``home healthaide'' is any individual who has successfully completed a training andcompetency evaluation program <T3>or </T3>a competency evaluation program that meets the requirementsestablished by the Secretary. Hence, as long as an individual has successfullycompleted a competency evaluation program that meets the requirements establishedfor those programs in andSection; 484.36(b), the individual is consideredto be a ``home health aide'', regardless of whether he or she has alsocompleted a training program that meets the requirements of andSection; 484.36(a).However, any training offered by an HHA or any other entity that is designedto enable an individual to successfully complete the competency evaluationprogram must meet the requirements of andSection; 484.36(a) to be consideredto be approved by the Secretary. 2. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Home health aide services. Section 484.36 is revised to require that HHAs may not use (on any basis,directly or under arrangements with another organization), any individualwho does not meet the definition of ``home health aide'' in andSection; 484.4to furnish home health aide services after August 14, 1989. 3. <T3>Standard: </T3>Home health aide training. The regulations specify_ andbullet; The requirements that a home health aide training program mustmeet (andSection; 484.36(a)). andbullet; The content requirements for home health aide training programs(andSection; 484.36). andbullet; That an aide training program must, at a minimum, include 75 hoursof a combination of classroom and supervised practical training as describedin andSection; 484.36(a)(1). The classroom training may be conducted in anHHA; we are not requiring that the classroom training be provided in anacademic setting. The training program must contain no fewer than 16 hoursof supervised practical training. The individual being trained must havecompleted at least 16 hours of classroom training before beginning supervisedpractical training (andSection; 484.36(a)(1)). We have established a requirement for 75 hours of total training to conformto the statutory requirement regarding hours of training for nurses' aidesin Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing facilities of various types.Sections 1819(f)(2)(A)(i)(II) and 1919(f)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act requirethat nurses' aides must have received a minimum of 75 hours of initialtraining in order to function as nurses' aides in these facilities. Weadopted the statutory standard for hours of training for nurses' aidesin these facilities because we believe that it is appropriate to requirethe same amount of training for home health aides as for nurses' aidesin these facilities. Nurses' aides in these facilities furnish essentiallythe same services to inpatients and residents of these facilities as homehealth aides furnish to patients in their homes. Since the statute specifies75 hours as the minimum amount of training for nurses' aides, we believethat this amount of training is equally applicable to home health aides.In addition, we have required that at least 16 hours of training be supervisedpractical training because we believe that hands-on experience is essentialto learning how to furnish these services. We have defined ``supervisedpractical training'' as meaning training in a laboratory or other settingin which the trainee performs tasks on an individual under the direct supervisionof a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Supervised practicaltraining could occur in the course of furnishing services to patients aslong as the trainee was accompanied and observed by a registered nurseor a licensed practical nurse who retained responsibility for the servicesbeing furnished. andbullet; That the home health aide training program must include each ofthe following subject areas: <ITAG tagnum="14">Communication skills. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Observation, reporting, and documentation of patient status and thecare or services furnished. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Reading and recording temperature, pulse, and respiration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Basic infection control procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Basic elements of body function and changes in body function thatmust be reported to an aide's supervisor. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Maintenance of a clean, safe, and healthy environment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Recognizing emergencies and knowledge of emergency procedures. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The physical, emotional, and developmental characteristics of thepopulations served by the HHA, including the need for respect for the patient,his or her privacy, and his or her property. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Appropriate and safe techniques in personal hygiene and grooming,including: bed bath; sponge, tub, or shower bath; shampoo, sink tub, orbed; nail and skin care;. oral hygiene. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Safe transfer techniques and ambulation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Normal range of motion and positioning. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Adequate nutrition and fluid intake. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Any other task that the HHA may choose to have the home health aideperform (andSection; 484.36(a)(1)). </ITAG>We believe that these topics must be addressed for an individual to beable to function appropriately as a home health aide. These subject areasare a composite of the areas included in the home health aide trainingstandards of the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Health Organizations(freestanding home care standards for 1988), the model curriculum of theNational Homecaring Council (now under the auspices of the Foundation forHome Care), and the National League for Nursing (standards for accreditedHHAs). Thus, we believe that these areas represent, to the degree possible,the current industry standards regarding the curriculum that is necessaryto ensure a minimum level of quality of home health aide services. HHAsare, of course, free to instruct aides in additional areas of concern tothem and to provide training of a duration that exceeds the mimimum requiredby these regulations.andbullet; That a home health aide training program may be offered by anyorganization (for example, an HHA) except as specified in andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(iii)(andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(i)). andbullet; The qualifications for instructors of home health aide trainingand supervision (andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(ii)). andbullet; That home health aide training programs that are offered by orin an HHA that has been determined to be out of compliance with one ormore conditions of participation within any of the 24 months prior to thestart of the training program do not meet the training program requirements(andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(i)). These provisions are supported by section 1891(a)(3)(D)(iii) of the Actand the legislative history. The Report of the Committee on Energy andCommerce, House of Representatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203(H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress, 1st Session 416 (1987)) further statesthat_``It should be emphasized that the Committee intends for these agenciesto have been in compliance with all_not most_the conditions of participation.Medicare certification_which can be awarded even when an agency has notmet all the participation requirements_alone, is [n]ot sufficient to grantrecognition of a training program offered by or in that agency.''  Therefore, we believe that it is the intent of Congress that the only entitiesrestricted from furnishing home health aide training are HHAs that havebeen out of compliance with one or more conditions of participation atany point within the previous two year period. Those HHAs are limited tohiring home health aides that already meet the training standards or arrangingfor training of home health aides through contracts with organizationsto which the HHAs are not directly or indirectly related as defined inregulations at andSection; 413.17. While the statute and the committee reports preclude acceptance of homehealth aide training programs provided ``by or in'' HHAs that have beenout of compliance with any of the conditions of participation, we do notbelieve that it was the intent of Congress to preclude HHAs from arrangingfor training and competency evaluation programs that meet these standardsthrough contracts with entities to which they are not related. The effectof a prohibition against use of a contract to acquire training may be theloss of access to home health aide services if HHAs are unable to hireaides who are already trained.  andbullet; That the training of home health aides and the supervision ofhome health aides during the supervised practical portion of the trainingbe performed by or under the general supervision of a registered nursewho possesses a minimum of 2 years of nursing experience. At least 1 yearof nursing experience must be in the provision of home health care, andthe registered nurse must have had at least 6 months experience supervisinghome health aide services (andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(ii)). We believe thatthis level of expertise is necessary as a minimum requirement for the individualwho will be responsible for the training of home health aides. We believethat only a registered nurse with this level of experience and expertisewill be able to oversee properly the training of home health aide traineesdue to the nature and diversity of the curriculum. The regulations, however, permit the use of individuals to supplement theinstruction as long as they function under the supervision of a qualifiedinstructor. For example, a licensed practical nurse could provide the homehealth aide training under the supervision of a registered nurse who has2 years experience in home health care and at least 6 months experiencein training home health aides. In addition, andSection; 484.36(b)(5)(iv)permits licensed practical nurses, as well as registered nurses, to supervisehome health aide candidates in the course of the supervised practical trainingrequired by andSection; 484.36(a)(1). However, a registered nurse must maintainoverall responsibility for the training of all home health aide candidates,and is required by andSection; 484.36(b)(3)(ii) to perform the competencyevaluation of home health aides. andbullet; That HHAs must maintain documentation that the requirements relatingto the training program are met (andSection; 484.36(a)(4)). We believe thatthis documentation is necessary for the Medicare State surveyor and theSecretary to determine if the home health aides used by an HHA meet therequirements of these regulations. A home health aide will be considered to have completed a training andcompetency evaluation program that was approved by the Secretary if thehome health aide has successfully completed a training and competency evaluationprogram that the Secretary determines met the requirements of this standardand the competency evaluation standard at andSection; 484.36(b) at the timethe aide completed it. Therefore, home health aides who have already compliedwith these requirements need not be retrained and reevaluated to be consideredto be ``home health aides.'' However, HHAs must document that all of theserequirements were met by the training and competency evaluation programsthat aides successfully completed. In making these determinations, pastin-service training and supervisory evaluation visits that occurred whenthe supervisor observed the aide furnishing care, can be considered ``supervisedpractical training.'' 3. <T3>Standard: </T3>Competency evaluation procedures. These regulations_ andbullet; Address the frequency of competency evaluations (andSection; 484.36(b)(1)).andbullet; Specify that individuals may furnish home health aide serviceson behalf of an HHA only after they have successfully completed a competencyevaluation program. HHAs are responsible for ensuring that the individualswho furnish home health aide services on their behalf meet the competencyrequirements (andSection; 484.36(b)(1)(i)). This requirement implements the intent of Congress that home health aidesmust be found to be competent before they may furnish home health aideservices, and that HHAs are responsible for using only competent home healthaides. Specifically, the Report of the Committee on the Budget, House ofRepresentatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 100-391,100th Congress, lst Session 417 (1987)) states that_ ``It is the Committee's intent that such determinations of competency areto be made before an aide can be allowed to provide a particular type ofcare or service.'' Moreover, page 416 of the Report states that_ ``As the Committee amendments state, home health agencies themselves areresponsible for ensuring that their aides are, in fact, trained and competent.''andbullet; Require that HHAs complete a performance review of each home healthaide no less frequently than every 12 months. The performance review mustmeet each of the requirements for the competency evaluation as set forthin andSection; 484.36(b) (andSection; 484.36(b)(1)(ii)). Section 1891(a)(3)(B)(ii) requires that there be periodic performance evaluationof home health aides. We chose to require that this review occur no lessthan every 12 months because we understand that annual performance reviewsare the norm for entities that currently perform these reviews, and webelieve that annual reviews are adequate to assess competency. We expectthat periodic performance reviews will be completed once per year basedon the information that supervisors gather in the course of performingsupervisory visits throughout the year, and by interviewing home healthaides about areas that aides may not have had to demonstrate competencyduring the year, such as emergency procedures. andbullet; Provide that a home health aide competency evaluation programmay be offered by any organization except in an HHA that has been determinedto be out of compliance with one or more of the requirements of part 484within any of the 24 months before the training program is to begin (andSection;484.36(b)(3)(i)). Section 1891(a)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act and the Committeelanguage that apply to when HHAs may not train home health aides, as discussedin reference to andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(i), also apply to competency evaluationprograms for home health aides. Therefore, HHAs that are precluded fromtraining their home health aides are also precluded from conducting competencyevaluations for those aides.  andbullet; Specify that home health aide competency evaluation programs thatare offered by or in HHAs that have been determined to be out of compliancewith one or more of the conditions of participation within any of the 24months prior to the competency evaluation do not meet the requirementsof these regulations (andSection; 484.36(b)(3)(iii)). andbullet; Require that competency evaluations be performed by a registerednurse. We believe that only a registered nurse is capable of determiningif an aide is competent to furnish care. andbullet; Require HHAs to maintain documentation that the requirements relatingto competency evaluation are met (andSection; 484.36(b)(5)(i)). We believethis documentation is necessary in order for the Medicare State surveyorand the Secretary to determine if home health aides used by HHAs meet therequirements of these regulations. andbullet; Require that a registered nurse must evaluate the competency ofeach aide with respect to the topics identified in andSection; 484.36(a)(1)(ii) through (xiii) and any other task an agency chooses to have an aideperform after observation of an aide's performance of the task with a patient(andSection; 484.36(b)(5)(ii)). We believe that, to protect patient healthand safety, it is essential that a home health aide's competency be demonstratedin each task that an HHA would have the home health aide perform. Moreover,we believe that it is necessary that a registered nurse perform evaluationsby observing a home health aide performing the task for which the aideis being evaluated. We do not believe that written examinations alone cansatisfactorily determine whether aides are competent to furnish patientcare. We believe that these requirements comply with the stated intentof Congress. Specifically, the Report of the Committee on the Budget, Houseof Representatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391,100th Congress, 1st Session 417 (1987)) states that_<ITAG tagnum="21">``Among the key issues that must be addressed is the level of competencythat is to be determined before services can be provided. In setting suchstandards, however, it should be made clear that the Committee does notintend to require that all home health aides be competent to provide alltypes of home health services. It does intend, however, that each individualaide be qualified to deliver each individual service or perform each individualtask for which he or she is responsible. For example, an aide who, amongother things, is expected or required to turn patients who are confinedto bed, must be determined to be competent in that job in order for thisrequirement to be met. Similarly, this mandate would require that an aidewho also is responsible for assisting in transferring patients from theirbed to a wheelchair or for helping to bathe them must be determined tobe competent in those tasks. It is the committee's intent that such determinationsof competency are to be made before an aide can be allowed to provide aparticular type of care or service.''</ITAG>andbullet; Specify that home health aides must not be considered to havesuccessfully passed competency evaluations if the aides are determinedby a qualified individual performing the evaluation to be unsatisfactoryin more than one of the topics evaluated (andSection; 484.36(b)(4)(ii)).We believe that the establishment of a certain minimal level of competencyis not inconsistent with Congress' intent that only competent persons providehome health aide services. We recognize that an unsatisfactory showingin only one of the areas does not necessarily prevent an aide from beingcompetent to furnish services for which he or she has demonstrated competence.However, section 1891(a)(3)(A) of the Act specifies that the agency mustuse as home health aides only individuals who have ``completed a trainingand competency evaluation program, or a competency evaluation program,that meets minimum standards established by the Secretary * * * and iscompetent to provide such items and services.'' We believe that a minimumstandard of satisfactory completion of the competency program is necessaryin order to determine if an individual who has completed a competency evaluationprogram is competent to furnish services. We considered specifying topicareas that would have to be satisfactorily completed for the aide to bedetermined competent to function. However, we chose to impose a requirementthat any individual who is found unsatisfactory in more than one of therequired topics will not be considered to have completed a competency evaluationprogram until he or she has been found satisfactory in at least 11 of therequired topics. We request specific public comment regarding this minimumstandard of completion of the program. andbullet; Require that home health aides cannot be considered competentin any task for which they are evaluated as ``unsatisfactory,'' and maynot perform that task as home health aides without direct supervision ofa licensed nurse until they receive remedial training and have passed witha subsequent evaluation of satisfactory (andSection; 484.36(b)(5)(iv)). Section 1891(a)(3)(C) of the Act precludes the use of home health aideswho have not demonstrated competency in the services that they furnish.Moreover, we believe that this restriction is clearly the intent of Congressas reflected in the committee report language quoted with regard to andSection;484.36(b)(4)(i) and (ii) above. The requirement, however, permits the useof a licensed nurse (that is, a registered nurse, a licensed practicalnurse, or a licensed vocational nurse) to accompany a home health aidecandidate in the provision of hands on care as part of the 16 hours ofsupervised practical training required for a home health aide trainingprogram to meet the Federal requirements at andSection; 484.36(a). andbullet; Require home health aides to receive no less than 3 hours of in-servicetraining per calendar quarter. This in-service training must be providedby a qualified instructor as defined in andSection; 484.36(a)(2)(ii) andmay occur while an aide is furnishing care to patients (andSection; 484.36(b)(7)).Section 1891(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act also requires that there be regularin-service training of home health aides. We believe that 3 hours of in-servicetraining per calendar quarter is the minimum that could effectively meetthe intent of Congress. HHAs have considerable latitude in determiningwhen this in-service training can occur.andbullet; Require HHAs to implement a competency evaluation program thatmeets the requirements of these regulations no later than February 14,1990, and provide preparation as may be necessary for an individual tosuccessfully complete a program after August 14, 1990 (andSection; 484.36(b)(5)).After August 14, 1990, home health aide services must be furnished by ahome health aide as defined in andSection; 484.2. We have extended thesestatutory effective dates by 6 months each because of the delay in promulgatingthis interim final rule. When home health aides have successfully completed an initial competencyevaluation program before February 14, 1990, that the Secretary determinesmet the requirements of andSection; 484.36(b) at the time the aides successfullycompleted it, then the home health aides will be considered to have successfullycompleted an initial competency evaluation program approved by the Secretary.Therefore, home health aides who have already complied with a competencyevaluation program that meets the requirements of this standard need notcomplete another initial competency evaluation to be considered to be homehealth aides. C. Plan of Treatment Section 1891(a)(5) of the Act, as added by section 4021(b) of Public Law100-203, requires HHAs to include ``an individual's'' plan of care requiredunder section 1861(m) of the Act as part of the patients' clinical records.Section 405.1223 (now recodified at andSection; 484.16) requires that carefollow a plan of treatment established and reviewed periodically by a physician,and defines the minimum content of the plan of treatment. The content andperiodic physician review requirements governing the ``plan of treatment'',which are required by the conditions of participation at andSection; 484.16,are identical to the content and periodic physician review requirementsof the plan, which section 1861(m) requires be present for the servicesto be covered. The effect of the statutory provisions is, therefore, torename the ``plan of treatment'' as ``plan of care''. This is not to beconfused with the nursing care plan, which is sometimes called a ``planof care''. The conditions of participation do not require that an HHA developor maintain a ``nursing care plan''. Consequently, we have changed the term ``plan of treatment'' to ``planof care'' to comply with section 4021 of Public Law 100-203. As revised,andSection; 484.48 requires that plans of care as described in andSection;484.18(a) be included in patients' clinical records. D. Federal, State, and Local Laws and Regulations and Accepted Standardsof Practice Section 1891(a)(6) of the Act, as added by section 4021(b) of Public Law100-203, requires HHAs to operate and furnish services in compliance withall applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, and withaccepted professional standards and principles that apply to professionalsfurnishing home health services. Section 1891(a)(2) of the Act requiresHHAs to notify State survey agencies of changes in the persons with anownership or control interest; the persons who are officers, directors,agents, or managing employees (as defined in section 1126(b) of the Act);and the corporation, association, or other company responsible for themanagement of an HHA. We have implemented these statutory requirementsin andSection; 484.12, which previously was limited to compliance with Federal,State, and local laws and regulations. These regulations implement the statute by_ andbullet; Requiring HHAs and their staff to operate and furnish servicesin compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.If State or applicable local laws provide for licensure of HHAs, HHAs notsubject to licensure must be approved by the licensing authority as meetingthe standards established for licensure (andSection; 484.12(a)). andbullet; Requiring HHAs to comply with the requirements of part 420, subpartC (andSection; 484.12(b)). (Subpart C implements section 1124 of the Act).andbullet; Requiring that HHAs disclose the information specified in andSection;484.12(b) (i) through (iii) to State survey agencies at an HHA's initialrequest for certification, and at the time of any change in this information(andSection; 484.12(b)). The Report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,House of Representatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep.No. 391, 100th Congress, 1st Session 414 (1987)) indicated that Congressintended that HHAs notify State survey agencies of these changes at thetime they take place (page 414 of that Report). Moreover, section 1891(a)(2)of the Act specifically states that this notice must be given ``at thetime of the change''. andbullet; Requiring HHAs to notify State agencies of the names and addressesof all persons with an ownership or control interest in an HHA as definedin andSection;andSection; 420.201, 420.202, and 420.206 (andSection; 484.12(b)(1)).Regulations at andSection;andSection; 420.201, 420.202, and 420.206 implementsection 1124(a)(3) of the Act and therefore have been cross referencedhere.andbullet; Requiring HHAs to notify State survey agencies of the names andaddresses of each person who is an officer, a director, an agent, or amanaging employee of an HHA as defined in andSection;andSection; 420.201, 420.202,and 420.206 (andSection; 484.12(b)(2)). Regulations at andSection;andSection;420.201, 420.202, and 420.206 implement section 1126(b) of the Act andtherefore have been cross referenced here. andbullet; Requiring HHAs to notify State survey agencies of the names andaddresses of the corporation, association, or other company that is responsiblefor managing an HHA, and the names and addresses of the chief executiveofficer and the chairpersons of the boards of directors of that corporation,association, or other company responsible for managing an HHA (andSection;484.12(b)(iii)). We believe that these requirements are necessary to clearlyidentify where the responsibility for the management of HHAs lies. In ourexperience, there are frequently extremely complex corporate arrangements,involving multiple layers of ownership and management, which cause it tobe extremely difficult to identify the entity that is legally responsiblefor the management of a provider. We believe it is the intent of Congressthat the licensing entity be advised of the names and addresses of theindividuals who are ultimately responsible for the management of an HHAso that they have the information necessary to evaluate the HHA beforelicensing. We believe that the names and addresses of the chief executiveofficer and the chairperson of the board of directors of the corporation,association, or other company that is responsible for managing an HHA arenecessary to this review. We believe that this requirement is supportedby the Report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representativesthat accompanied Public Law. 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391, 100th Congress,lst Session 414 (1987)), which states that_<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee believes these new requirements must be establishedin order to provide licensing agencies with important and relevant informationthat should be considered as part of the licensing process. With the numberof home health agencies growing at an annual rate of some 20 to 25 percent,there is an increasing need for licensing officials to have access to informationabout who owns and manages agencies that serve a vulnerable populationand that receive public dollars. The backgrounds of individuals who have,for example, been convicted of fraud or fined for violating program stricturesin the past should be reviewed carefully before a license to operate isgranted or renewed. Similar action should be taken with regard to the recordsof organizations or companies that have owned or managed home health agencies(or other health facilities such as a nursing home) that have been previouslyde-certified from participation in either the Medicare or Medicaid program.But unless licensing bodies receive notice of changes in ownership or management,such investigations are more difficult to undertake.</ITAG>andbullet; Requiring that HHAs and their staff comply with accepted professionalstandards and principles that apply to professionals furnishing items andservices in HHAs. The Report of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Houseof Representatives that accompanied Public Law 100-203 (H.R. Rep. No. 391,100th Congress, 1st Session 415 (1987)), states that_<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee intends such standards and principles to include thosethat are applicable to the delivery of professional services in a homehealth care setting, as well as the more general standards and principleswith which a member of a particular health profession is expected to comply.</ITAG>F. Deletion of Addenda to andSection; 405.1221(d) We have deleted from the appendix to the home health conditions of participation,the addenda to andSection; 405.1221(d) that identifies specific State requirementsthat States had imposed upon HHAs as Federal conditions of participationbecause they were considered to be higher than the Federal requirements.This appendix is being deleted because section 1891(a)(2) of the Act, asamended by Public Law 100-203, requires that HHAs comply with all applicableFederal, State, and local laws and regulations. We believe that the specifiedState requirements contained in the appendix are all requirements of Stateor local laws and regulations that apply to HHAs. Therefore, section 1891(a)(2)of the Act, as amended by Public Law 100-203, requires that the more stringentrequirements contained in the appendix (as well as applicable State orlocal laws and regulations that have not been published in the appendix)must be met by HHAs so that they can be certified to participate in theMedicare program. Hence, there is no need to publish them in an appendixto the conditions of participation.<ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Reduction in Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements</ITAG>A. Background Regulations at 5 CFR 1320.14 implement the requirement of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) that authorizes the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) to review all information collection and recordkeepingrequirements in Federal regulations. On December 31, 1986, we publisheda proposed rule (51 FR 47266) that responded to OMB's request for changesto reduce or simplify recordkeeping requirements within the conditionsof participation for HHAs, independent laboratories, providers of outpatientphysical therapy, physical therapists in independent practice, and providersof outpatient speech therapy. The proposed rule also solicits public commentson those changes as well as on all recordkeeping requirements containedin 42 CFR part 405, subparts L, M, and O. B. Analysis of Comments Received on December 31, 1986 Proposed Rule Each condition of participation and standard identified in the proposedrule contains requirements other than the paperwork burden reduction requirementson which the proposed rule was based. There were many comments regardingissues that were not related to reducing the paperwork burden requirements.While we have taken these other comments under advisement, we have notadopted them in this final rule, nor have we responded to them in thispreamble. We are unable to adopt the commenters' suggestions on requirementsother than those that we specifically addressed in the proposed rule becauseto do so would be to adopt them without providing an opportunity for publiccomment. We will, however, consider the recommendations of the commentersbefore proposing future changes to the conditions of participation. Concerning the reduction of information collection and recordkeeping requirementsfor the conditions of participation for HHAs, we received comments from69 commenters, which included professional organizations and associations,HHAs, physical therapists, rehabilitation agencies, public health departments,State governmental agencies, universities, and private individuals. Wehave summarized below the major provisions of the proposed rule that relateto the conditions of participation for HHAs and for which comments werereceived. A summary of those comments and our responses follow an explanationof each provision. 1. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Organization, services, administration_Standard:Personnel policies and records (andSection; 405.1221(e)). Section 405.1221(e) requires that HHA personnel records include currentjob descriptions, qualifications, evidence of licensure (if applicable),performance evaluations, and health examinations. We proposed to revisethese requirements to require that HHA personnel records retain only qualificationsand evidence of State licensure (if applicable). <T3>Comments: </T3>_Many commenters supported the reduction of this information,however other commenters objected to this reduction. Those who objectedstated that elimination of these requirements would minimize an HHA's controlover individuals who furnished services under arrangements with an HHA.They indicated that the elimination of these requirements would resultin the use of less qualified personnel and that patient outcomes couldsuffer as a result. Commenters also stated that evidence of health examinationsis important to increasing the likelihood that persons furnishing homehealth care are free from disease that could be communicated to patients.<T3>Response: </T3>We have decided to revise the current requirements aswe had proposed. We expect that the emphasis of both HHAs and surveyorswill be on the outcome of patient care, rather than on the content of personnelfiles. We are requiring that personnel records include only qualificationsand licensure information because we believe that only those records directlyimpact the quality of patient care. 2. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Organization, services, administration_Standard:Personnel under hourly or per visit contracts (andSection; 405.1221(f)).Section 405.1221(f)(1) specifies that, if personnel under hourly or pervisit contract are used by an HHA, a written contract must exist betweenthe two parties that designates clearly: (i) That patients are accepted for care only by the primary HHA; (ii) The services that are to be provided; (iii) The need to conform to all applicable agency policies including personnelqualifications; (iv) The responsibility for participating in developing plans of treatment; (v) The manner in which services will be controlled, coordinated, and evaluatedby the primary HHA; (vi) The procedures for submitting clinical and progress notes, schedulingof visits, periodic patient evaluation; and (vii) The procedures for determining charges and payment.Section 405.1221(h) specifies the requirements to be met by an HHA thatfurnishes services under an arrangement with another entity. Specifically,there must be a written contract between an HHA and another entity thatmeets the requirements of andSection; 405.1221(f)(1) and section 1861(w)of the Act. Therefore, any revisions to the requirements of andSection; 405.1221(f)(1)also revise the content of the contracts between an HHA and an entity thatprovides services on behalf of the HHA under arrangements in accordancewith section 1861(w)(1) of the Act. We proposed to revise andSection; 405.1221(f) by removing the explicit contractualrequirements, such as the designation of the procedures for submissionof clinical records, and the manner in which the services would be controlled,coordinated, and evaluated by the agency. We proposed to require that personnelunder contract be held accountable for meeting the same agency requirementsas salaried personnel as set forth in subpart L (andSection; 405.1221(f)(3),51 FR 47271). <T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters requested that we delete any specificationsfor these contracts. Other commenters requested that we retain andSection;405.1221(f)(1)(v) because in the commenters' opinions, it is essentialthat a contract address the manner in which care is controlled, coordinated,and evaluated since the contract provisions apply to services providedunder arrangements with another entity. Other commenters opposed the requirementat andSection; 405.1221(f)(1)(vii) that the contracts address ``proceduresfor determining charges and reimbursement''. Another commenter objectedto the requirement in andSection; 405.1221(f)(1)(iii) that the personnelconform to all applicable agency personnel policies, because the commenterbelieves it is often difficult to do so. Another commenter recommendedthat we consult with the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) to avoid conflict with labor laws and IRS laws for contract workers.However, this commenter did not specify any conflicts caused by these regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>Upon reconsideration, we have not removed any of thecontract requirements between an HHA and personnel paid on a per hour orper visit basis (andSection; 405.1221(f)) and between an HHA and entitiesthat furnish services under arrangements on behalf of an HHA (andSection;405.1221(h) through its reference to andSection; 405.1221(f)(1)). We chosenot to eliminate these requirements as a result of the OIG study of homehealth aide services described earlier. This study revealed widespreadproblems in the provision of home health aide services, and found a significantlydisproportionate share of the problems with the services of home healthaides who furnish services under an arrangement between an HHA and anotherentity. The most frequently occurring problem is that home health aides who arenot employees of an HHA do not perform all of the tasks that a physicianorders the aides to perform. OIG found that the supervision of these aides,in particular, is inadequate, and that patients are not likely to recoveras quickly or easily as they might, had the services ordered been furnished.Clearly, there are weaknesses in the provision of home health aide servicesthat impact adversely upon patient care. We believe that deleting thoseaspects of the required content of these contracts that address most specificallypatient care (such as the control, coordination, and evaluation of carefurnished under contract and the submission of clinical record information)will exacerbate those weaknesses, since the OIG study found that the problemswith patient care occurred because of inadequate control, and inadequatecoordination and evaluation of care furnished under the contract. Therefore,we are retaining the current requirements while we seek ways to resolvethe problems that OIG identified with home health aide services providedunder contract.   We do, however, recognize that the language in andSection; 405.1221(f)(1)(vii),which requires ``procedures for determining charges and reimbursement''could be better stated as ``payment for services furnished under the contract''.While this contract requirement does not impact specifically on the carefurnished, it is essential to a determination of whether the services arefurnished under an arrangement that meets the requirement of section 1861(w)(1)of the Act that an arrangement provides that Medicare payment to an HHAis payment in full for the services furnished under the contract. We do not believe that it is necessary to consult with the Department ofLabor or IRS regarding their laws for ``contract employees''. The commenterpresented no substantial conflict that needs to be resolved by consultingwith the Department of Labor or IRS. 3. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Organization, services, administration_Standard:Coordination of patient services (andSection; 405.1221(g)). This standard requires that the clinical record support an HHA's attemptsto assure a free exchange of information among all personnel furnishingservices. We proposed only clarifying changes to the language of this requirement.<T3>Comment: </T3>Most commenters supported our proposal. However, onecommenter asked whether the requirement that all personnel who furnishservices maintain liaison to support the objectives of the plan of treatmentapplied to all services furnished by an HHA or only to those on the planof treatment. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 405.1223 requires that the plan of treatmentcontain the services that an HHA furnishes to a patient during the periodcovered by the plan of treatment. Therefore, the coordination of servicesrequired by andSection; 405.1221(g) encompasses all services furnished byan HHA to a patient. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that HCFA Form 486 (Medicare'smedical information form and update) be sent to a physician every 60 daysin lieu of a summary report on a patient's condition, which is requiredby andSection; 405.1221(g). <T3>Response: </T3>HCFA Form 486 is prepared only for Medicare beneficiarieswhen an HHA bills Medicare for care. It is not completed ordinarily fornon-Medicare patients, as is the summary report that is required by andSection;405.1221(g). An HHA may, if it chooses, use a completed HCFA Form 486 asthe summary report, as long as it summarizes adequately the patient's condition.However, we do not believe that any useful purpose would be served by requiringits use for all patients in lieu of any other summary report an HHA maynow prepare and send to physicians every 60 days. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that we revise andSection; 405.1221(g)to require that a written summary report of a patient's condition be sentto a physician no less frequently than every 62 days, rather than 60 daysas currently required. <T3>Response: </T3>We have revised the regulation to permit the submissionof the summary report no less often than every 62 days (rather than every60 days) to conform the timeframe to the revision we have made to the frequencyof physician review (andSection; 405.1223(b), redesignated as andSection; 484.16)and signature (andSection; 405.1633) on the plan of care. 4. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Organization, services, administration_Standard:Institutional planning (andSection; 405.1221(i)). This standard requires that an HHA conform to certain broad requirementsrelating to the formulation of an annual operating budget and an agencygenerated three-year capital expenditure program for anticipated expendituresthat exceed a set dollar amount. We proposed to increase this amount from$100,000 to $600,000 in accordance with sections 1122(g) and 1861(z) ofthe Act, as amended by section 607 of the Social Security Amendments of1983, Pub. L. No. 98-21. The other provisions are required explicitly bysection 1861(z) of the Act or are necessary for purposes of determiningwhether the threshold amount has been exceeded. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters supported this statutory change. <T3>Response: </T3>As proposed, we have revised andSection; 405.1221(i)(2)to reflect the increase in the threshold amount from $100,000 to $600,000.5. Condition of participation: Acceptance of patients, plan of treatment,medical supervision_Standard: Plan of treatment (andSection; 405.1223(a)).This standard requires that care follow a plan of treatment establishedand reviewed periodically by a physician, and defines the minimum contentof the plan of treatment. We proposed to retain this standard without change.However, we requested comments on the continued need for these requirements.As explained in section III. D. of this preamble, we have changed the term``plan of treatment'' to ``plan of care'' to comply with section 4021(b)of Pub. L. 100-203. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that when speech therapy servicesare furnished, the speech therapist should be allowed to establish an HHAplan of treatment without physician consultation or approval. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 1861(m) of the Act requires a physician to establishand periodically review a plan of care, and section 1891(a)(4) of the Actrequires HHAs to include in their clinical records a plan of care as requiredunder section 1861(m)(4) of the Act. Therefore, the statute requires thatHHAs have a plan of care that is established and approved by a physicianfor each individual served by the agency. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that we revise andSection; 405.1223(a)to permit a physician to order an initial assessment of the need for homecare through a hospital discharge planner or the physician's office staff,and that the plan of care established as a result of that initial assessmentbe reviewed by the physician only if there are additions or modificationsto the original plan. <T3>Response: </T3>Acceptance of the commenter's suggestion would violatesection 1891(a)(4) of the Act that requires a plan of care, establishedand reviewed periodically by the physician, be included in the patient'sclinical records.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter believes that the inclusion of orders forspecific procedures and modalities of therapy services (specifically amount,frequency, and duration of these services) for a period of 60 days is inappropriatesince a patient's response can vary from day to day, and the amount, frequency,and duration of treatments may need to be changed more frequently thanevery 60 days. <T3>Response: </T3>We believe that it is important to patient health andsafety that this level of specificity be included in the plan of care sothat any professional who must care for the patient is aware of the servicesordered by the physician for the patient. While the plan of care must bereviewed no less than every 62 days (as revised by these regulations atandSection; 405.1221(g)), health professionals are encouraged to contactthe physician to acquire changes in orders whenever changes appear appropriateto the patient's treatment. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters believe that a physician should signonly for those activities within the plan of treatment for which the physicianis responsible. One commenter mentioned specifically that a physician shouldnot be responsible for a nurse's plan of care. <T3>Response: </T3>We believe that a physician is responsible for all servicesthat are ordered when he or she approves a plan of care in the same waythat the physician is responsible for all services he or she orders ina hospital or in a skilled nursing facility. An HHA is (and always hasbeen) found to be out of compliance with these regulations if it furnishesany care that is not included in a plan of care that a physician has establishedand approved. The purpose of a plan of care is to provide the information essential forthe provision of quality care. It is the only care plan that an HHA isrequired by these regulations to keep, and therefore, it must contain sufficientinformation to permit staff who are not familiar with the patient to providequality care. If an HHA desires to also develop a ``nurse's plan of care'',it is certainly free to do so to the degree that it does not cause informationnecessary to the care of a patient to be deleted or omitted from the planof care that must be established and reviewed periodically by a physician.6. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Acceptance of patients, plan of treatment,medical supervision_Standard: Periodic review of plan of treatment (andSection;405.1223(b)). This standard requires that the status of each patient be reviewed no lessfrequently than every 60 days by HHA staff and the attending physician.We proposed to retain the requirement for physician and HHA staff review,but to require that the status of each patient be reviewed no less frequentlythan every 62 days to conform this requirement to the physician certificationrequirement (andSection; 405.1633). <T3>Comments: </T3>Many commenters supported the proposed conforming change.One commenter requested that the requirement for periodic physician reviewof the plan of treatment be eliminated because the physician must alsosign a physician certification every two months and receive a summary reportevery 60 days. Another commenter suggested that we require that an HHAprovide the physician who signed the plan of care with a summary reportof a patient's condition no less frequently than every 62 days also, toconform it to the physician certification, and plan of care signature requirements.<T3>Response: </T3>We have retained the requirement for the physician reviewand signature on the plan of care because, as we have explained with respectto the initial physician plan of care signature, we believe it is necessaryto ensure patient health and safety, and we believe that it is necessaryto implement section 1891(a)(4) of the Act, which incorporates section1861(m) of the Act by reference. As proposed, we revised the timeframeto require that the review be completed no less frequently than every 62days (andSection; 405.1223(b)). Moreover, we have adopted the suggestionthat a summary report that an HHA sends to a physician be sent no lessfrequently than every 62 days (andSection; 405.1221(g)). We believe thatconforming these timeframes to one another will be less confusing to HHAsand Medicare State surveyors and more efficient. 7. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Skilled nursing service_Standard:Duties of the registered nurse (andSection; 405.1224(a)) and Standard: Dutiesof the licensed practical nurse (andSection; 405.1224(b)). These standards describe the duties of registered nurses (RNs) and licensedpractical nurses (LPNs) including their responsibilities to prepare clinicalnotes and progress notes. We did not propose to revise the requirementsregarding clinical notes and progress notes since we believe that theserequirements are consistent with accepted professional standards of practiceand therefore should not be burdensome. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters agreed that the writing of clinical notesand progress notes are accepted professional responsibilities of RNs andLPNs. The other comments on this section addressed issues that we did notraise in the proposed rule and to which we are not responding in this finalrule. <T3>Response: </T3>We have not revised the regulations with respect toRN and LPN completion of clinical notes and progress notes. 8. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3>_Therapy services_Standard: Supervisionof physical therapy assistant and occupational therapy assistant (andSection;405.1225(a)). This section sets forth standards for the preparation of clinical and progressnotes by physical therapy assistants and occupational therapy assistants.We proposed no changes to the supervision standard because we believe thatthe requirements are consistent with accepted professional standards ofpractice and that, therefore, virtually no recordkeeping burden is imposed.However, we requested comments on it. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters generally did not object to the requirementsregarding the completion of clinical and progress notes by physical therapyassistants and occupational therapy assistants. The other comments addressedaspects of the section that were not the subject of the proposed rule.<T3>Response: </T3>We have retained without change the requirements withregard to clinical and progress notes.I. Condition of participation: Medical social services (andSection; 405.1226).This section contains requirements regarding medical social worker andmedical social work assistant completion of clinical and progress noteson the patient's condition and assisting in the development of the planof treatment. We proposed no specific changes to these requirements becausewe believe that the requirements for completion of clinical notes and progressnotes are consistent with accepted professional standards for medical socialwork and therefore impose no recordkeeping burden. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters did not oppose the current requirements regardingsocial worker and social work assistant completion of progress and clinicalnotes. The other comments on this section addressed issues that we didnot raise in the proposed rule and to which we are not responding in thisfinal rule. <T3>Response: </T3>We have retained without change the requirements withregard to clinical and progress notes. 9. Condition of participation: Clinical records (andSection; 405.1228). This section contains specific requirements for maintaining, retaining,and protecting clinical records for every patient receiving services froman HHA. We proposed to keep the current requirements, but to make a technicalchange to the existing language of the regulation. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested requirements beyond thoseimposed by the current regulations that the commenters believe are necessaryto ensure patient health and safety. <T3>Response: </T3>We are not making changes other than the proposed technicalchange. We will consider the commenters' suggestions before we proposefuture rulemaking. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the requirement that clinicalnotes be kept on all patients. They requested that we revise andSection;405.1228 (redesignated as andSection; 484.48) to require that these notesbe maintained only for Medicare patients. <T3>Response: </T3>We have not accepted this comment. Section 1861(o) ofthe Act requires that in order to be considered an ``HHA'', an entity mustmaintain clinical records on its patients. As with other conditions ofparticipation, this requirement is not limited to Medicare patients, butrather applies to all patients and must be met before an HHA can be certifiedto participate in the Medicare program. The clinical note is the most essentialelement of a patient's clinical records since it describes the servicesfurnished to the patient, the patient's response to treatment and currentstatus. This information is essential to ensure the quality of the carebeing furnished by an HHA. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters requested that we clarify that theterms ``progress notes'' and ``clinical notes'' are identical and may beused interchangeably. <T3>Response: </T3>We have not made this change because, as defined inthe conditions of participation at andSection; 405.1202 (redesignated asandSection; 484.2), clinical notes and progress notes differ. A clinicalnote must be prepared for each visit to a patient on the date of the visit,and must include a description of signs and symptoms, treatment and ordrug given, the patient's reaction and any changes in the patient's physicalor emotional condition. In contrast, a progress note is a dated writtennotation by a member of the health team that summarizes facts about thecare and the patient's response over a specified period of time. Thus,the progress note is a summary of the clinical notes for a specific periodof time. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters objected to the requirement that medical recordsbe retained for five years after the month that the applicable cost reportis filed unless State law requires that they be retained for a longer periodof time. One commenter suggested that the retention period be reduced tothree years. <T3>Response: </T3>We have kept the current record retention requirementbecause we believe that retention of the records for this period of timeis necessary to ensure that the records needed to verify the appropriatenessof Medicare payment are available. The clinical records provide the onlyevidence that an HHA furnished services for which it has claimed payment.HHAs do not submit cost reports to which the services relate until threemonths after the year in which the services were furnished (or for an additionalthree months if an extension is granted). Moreover, the services includedin a cost report may have been furnished in the last three months of theprevious year. Since the Federal government may perform an audit of agencyrecords any time until three years after submission of the cost report(or later if there is evidence of program fraud), the records must be retainedfor at least four years and nine months after submission of a cost report.Otherwise, there would be no evidence of the total number of visits furnishedand of the number of visits furnished to Medicare patients if audit ofthe source information is needed to settle an HHA's cost report. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that nurses should be able to carryclinical records with them when visiting a patient's home since practicingwithout them is unsafe and duplicating them is expensive and burdensome.Section 405.1228(b) (redesignated as andSection; 484.48) requires that clinicalrecords be safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use. <T3>Response: </T3>Medicare regulations do not prohibit the removal ofclinical records for use by a nurse when furnishing care. Nevertheless,an HHA may impose policies and procedures it believes will ensure thatclinical records are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use. 10. <T3>Condition of participation: </T3>Evaluation_Standard: Policy and administrativereview (andSection; 405.1229(a)). This standard requires an HHA to assess the overall status of its patientcare programs. One method of furthering this evaluation is to collect patientcare and related data. This standard suggests selected data that an HHAmight find useful in the course of its evaluation. We proposed to deletethe detailed list of suggested data items from this section because, uponreconsideration, we believe that an HHA should have the flexibility totailor the data collected to its unique characteristics.<T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters supported this proposed change. Severalcommenters opposed this proposed change. One commenter indicated that theentire list should be retained. Another commenter requested that the informationon the number of patient visits made by an HHA and the records of stafftime be retained. Those who suggested that this information be kept wereconcerned that this information would not be available for use in determiningappropriate Medicare payment if these regulations did not include thislist. The other comments on this section addressed issues that we did notaddress in the proposed rule and to which we are not responding in thisfinal rule. <T3>Response:</T3> As proposed, we have deleted the list of data that theregulations suggested be collected. We believe that an HHA is able to determinewhich data elements will facilitate its review without Federal regulationson this aspect of its operation. Notwithstanding the elimination of thislist from these regulations, an HHA will continue to be required, underseparate statutory authority, to maintain the data necessary to substantiatethe information on its Medicare cost report. 11. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Evaluation_Standard: Clinical recordreview (andSection; 405.1229(b)). We did not propose to revise this section of the regulations nor did wereceive any comments. However, we have extended the period that may becovered by the review of clinical records from 60 days to 62 days to conformto the changes we have made with respect to the frequency of physicianreview of a plan of care, and the period of time to be covered by a summaryreport of a patient's condition. Since we are extending the period, ratherthan reducing it, and since we are making the change to conform it to otherrequirements, we believe that we are reducing, rather than adding to theburden imposed by these regulations. B. Regulation Provisions 1. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Organization, services, administration_Standard:Coordination of patient services (andSection; 405.1221(g)). We have revised andSection; 405.1221(g) to permit the submission of the summaryreport no less than every 62 days (rather than every 60 days) to conformthe timeframe to the revision we have made to the frequency of physicianreview (andSection; 405.1223(b) and signature (andSection; 405.1633) on theplan of care. 2. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Organization, services, administration_Standard:Institutional planning (andSection; 405.1221(i)). We have revised andSection; 405.1221(i)(2) to reflect the increase in thethreshold amount (for anticipated expenditures within an agency's generatedthree-year capital expenditure program) from $100,000 to $600,000. 3. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Acceptance of patients, plan of treatment,medical supervision_Standard: Plan of treatment (andSection; 405.1223(a)).We have changed the term ``plan of treatment'' to read ``plan of care''to comply with section 4021 of Public Law 100-203. 4. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Acceptance of patients, plan of treatment,medical supervision-Standard: Periodic review of plan of treatment (andSection;405.1223(b)). We retained the requirement for physician and HHA staff review, with onechange. The status of each patient must be reviewed no less frequentlythan every 62 days (rather than 60 days) to conform this requirement tothe physician certification requirement (andSection; 405.1633). 5. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Evaluation_Standard: Policy and administrativereview (andSection; 405.1229(a)). We have deleted the list of selected data that an HHA might find usefulin the course of evaluating its patient care programs. 6. <T3>Condition of participation:</T3> Evaluation_Standard: Clinical recordreview (andSection; 405.1229(b)). We extended the period that may be covered by the review of clinical recordsfrom 60 days to 62 days to conform to the changes we have made with respectto the frequency of physician review of a plan of care, and the periodof time to be covered by a summary report of a patient's condition.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any final rule that meets one of the E.O.criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that will be likely to result in_andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprisesto compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This final rule implements section 1861(o)(6) of the Act, as amended bysection 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203; section 1891(a) of the Act, as addedby section 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203; and certain changes in recordkeepingrequirements that had been previously proposed on December 31, 1986 (51FR 47266). As described in section I of this document, section 4021(b)of Public Law 100-203 requires that an HHA meet the following conditions:andbullet; Protect and promote the rights of each individual under its care.andbullet; Notify the State entity responsible for the licensing or certificationof the agency of a change in ownership, and management of the agency. andbullet; After December 31, l989, use as a home health aide only individualswho have been determined to be competent to furnish part-time or intermittenthome health aide care. andbullet; Use individuals that meet minimum training standards establishedby the Secretary to use or demonstrate durable medical equipment when furnishingservices. andbullet; Include an individual's plan of care required under section 1861(m)of the Act as part of the individual's clinical records described in section1861(o)(3) of the Act (currently appears as a condition of participationin 42 CFR 4015.1228). andbullet; Operate and furnish services in compliance with all applicableFederal, State, and local laws and regulations (including the requirementsof section 1124 of the Act) and with accepted professional standards andprinciples that apply to professionals furnishing services in an HHA (currentlyappears as a condition of participation in 42 CFR 405.1220). With the exception of those regulations implementing section 1891(a)(3)of the Act that require the Secretary to establish minimum standards ofcompetency for home health aides who are providing services to Medicarepatients either under contract to an HHA or are employed directly by anHHA, we believe that the other provisions of this rule that are requiredby section 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203 are largely conforming changesto the statute. In those instances in which our regulations go beyond astrict reading of the statute in implementing the patients' rights provisionsof the Act, we believe the regulations serve to clarify the intent of Congressby specifying procedures to be followed in implementing the law. The discretionwe have exercised in detailing technical requirements, we believe, willnot impose a significant burden on HHAs. We do recognize that the provisionsrequiring HHAs to protect Medicare patients rights may impose some additionalcosts on those HHAs that do not already have such policies. However, weview these effects as resulting from the statute rather than from thisrule. With respect to the changes in recordkeeping requirements that we proposedin the December 31, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>and which are being implemented by this rulewe consider the changes to be minor and believe they will have little effecton the operations of HHAs. Section 1891(a)(3) of the Act, requiring the establishment of competencyand training standards for home health aides, gives the Secretary broadlatitude in specifying competency standards and curricula for trainingaides. We expect that most home health aides currently employed by HHAswill achieve the required level of competency through their work experienceby the time the new standards become effective. Thus, we do not expectthat most aides currently working in HHAs will require formal trainingto meet the competency standards, and as a result, the cost of trainingthe present work force of HHA aides should be minimal. It should be noted that several States already have some training and certificationrequirements as a condition of employment for home health aides. Althoughwe cannot determine whether the training requirements in these States aresufficient to meet the competency standards being promulgated under thisrule, we expect that HHAs operating in these States have already adjustedtheir operations to meet the State requirements. Furthermore, we are awarethat some States have legislation pending that would require home healthaide competency certification as a condition of licensing HHAs. Thus, wedo not expect this rule to have a significant effect on HHAs operatingin those States that either already require aide training and certificationor will promulgate such standards in the near future. Moreover, the renewed emphasis on HHA accreditation by the National Leagueof Nurses under its long-standing program, and the recent adoption by theJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) ofnew standards for the accreditation of home health care providers will,we believe, encourage many HHAs to adopt voluntarily many of the provisionsset forth in this rule. In addition, many HHAs use the National HomecaringCouncil's model curriculum and evaluation program for home health aidetraining and evaluation. This program also contains many of the elementsof these regulations. We believe that voluntary compliance with these industrystandards will reduce significantly the impact of these Federal regulationson most HHAs. We anticipate that most HHAs will seek to comply with privateindustry standards to ensure that they are not placed at a competitivedisadvantage. Therefore, these Federal regulations will affect most agenciesonly to the limited extent that the requirements of the Federal regulationsexceed those of the private standards.In conclusion, for all the reasons discussed above, we believe that theoverall effect of this rule will be small. We do not expect this rule tohave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor do weexpect it to meet any of the other criteria of a major rule under E.O.12291. Therefore we have not prepared a regulatory impact analysis. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unlessthe Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA,all HHAs are treated as small entities. For the reasons outlined in our discussion of E.O. 12291, we do not expectHHAs to experience significant adverse effects from this rule. Therefore,we have determined, and the Secretary certifies that this rule will nothave a significant impact on a substantial number of HHAs. Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a final rule may have a significant impact on the operationsof a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis mustconform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital withfewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined,and the Secretary certifies that this final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small ruralhospitals. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>Section 4039(g) of Public Law 100-203 provides that, if necessary, we mayissue regulations to implement certain provisions of that law, includingthe HHA provisions of these regulations and other Medicare reforms, onan interim final basis. Congress, in Public Law 100-203, charged the agencywith developing and implementing several significant and complex paymentreforms. Congress recognized, however, that the agency may not be ableboth to develop the regulations necessary to implement these reforms andto engage in the time-and resource-consuming process entailed by the usualnotice and comment procedure before the effective dates which it prescribed.Indeed, in the case of the modifications to the HHA conditions of participationcontained in section 4021(b) of Public Law 100-203 (enacted December 22,1987), Congress intended for the Secretary to make use of interim finalrules by imposing, in section 4021(c), a July 1, 1989 effective date onthe HHA conditions of participation modifications. The usual notice andcomment procedures could not have been completed in the time allowed. The Secretary believes it necessary to exercise his option, under section4039(g), to issue these provisions as an interim final rule in order toallow HHAs sufficient time to comply the new guidelines, which statutorilybecome effective on July 1, 1989. Although this rule is being issued as an interim final rule, we are interestedin comments and advice regarding changes that should be made to this issuance.Therefore, we are providing a 60-day comment period for public comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Response to Comments </ITAG>Because of the large number of comments we receive on interim final regulations,we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, if we decideto change the regulations, we will publish an additional <T4>Federal Register</T4> rule and respond to the major issues in the preambleto that rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII.
