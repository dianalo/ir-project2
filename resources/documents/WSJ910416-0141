After two months of spreading strikes, the shortage ofcoal threatens to close plants in the Soviet Union's mainindustrial area in the Ural mountains and in Siberia.</LP><TEXT>   The Kuzbass region of Siberia has been hardest hit by thestrikes, with 51 of its 76 mines closed as of yesterday,according to strike leaders. In addition, 12 of the 13 minesin the Vorkuta region in the far north are on strike.   The Soviet government says losses in coal and relatedindustries already amount to billions of rubles, exacerbatinga nationwide recession that cut by 10% the total value ofgoods and services produced in the country in the firstquarter.   But striking miners say they won't go back to work untilthe leadership of the Soviet Union is turned over to acoalition of representatives of the Soviet republics, whichwould determine the future structure of the Sovietgovernment.   &quot;It's nothing to do with Gorbachev personally,&quot; saysAlexander Kolesnikov, a strike leader in the Kuzbass. &quot;It'sthe system that has to go.&quot;   The miners want the coal industry to be removed from thejurisdiction of the Kremlin and handed over to the republics.But as of yesterday, their only economic demand was to beallowed to sell more coal at prices they negotiatethemselves, according to Mr. Kolesnikov.   Tension in other parts of the country has abated, althoughthat may be only temporary. Many miners in the Donbass coalregion went back to work early this month, after thegovernment promised to double their wages. But yesterdaythousands of workers demonstrated in Donetsk to show supportfor miners at 50 pits who are withholding coal deliveries insolidarity with the political demands of their colleagues inthe Kuzbass.   A strike that swept factories in Minsk last week has beencalled off temporarily while workers' representativesnegotiate with the Byelorussian republican government. Butthe strikers' demands that Byelorussia install a multipartygovernment and take over all factories currently run by theKremlin are unlikely to be met by next Monday, the day theyplan to call a general strike in the republic.   &quot;The authorities are stalling in the talks,&quot; a spokesmanfor the Minsk workers told Reuters news service. &quot;All plantsare working at the moment, but the workers are ready to walkout again if {the authorities'} attitude doesn't change. . .. We are ready to strike to the bitter end.&quot;   Meanwhile, in Moscow, rumors that some Communist Partygroups are plotting to join with the coal miners to push Mr.Gorbachev out have provoked a backlash of support for thepresident. Last week, Yuri Blokhin, a leader of the hard-lineSoyuz group, denied reports that Soyuz wanted Mr. Gorbachevto resign. Leaders of Democratic Russia, the Soviet Union'slargest opposition party, alarmed by the possibility of atakeover by Communist hard-liners, are also softening theirattacks on the president.   Stopping in Khabarovsk on his way to Japan, PresidentGorbachev seemed confident yesterday, affirming hiscommitment to economic reform and announcing plans to gatherthe leaders of the republics to sign his new Union Treatysome time this month.   But the Kremlin is taking a tough stance against thestriking miners. Mr. Gorbachev's own anti-crisis program,announced last week, called for a nationwide moratorium onall strikes. His minister of metallurgy, Serafim Kolpakov,has proposed a state of emergency to force coal miners backto work.   Meanwhile, the official Soviet press is full of angrycomplaints from steel workers and railroaders, warningstrikers that they will be blamed for production shortfalls.   The newspaper Pravda yesterday featured on its front pagea letter from a &quot;mother of a miner&quot; cautioning ominously that&quot;Strikes . . . are a road to nowhere. They won't achieveanything except the ruin of the country.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
