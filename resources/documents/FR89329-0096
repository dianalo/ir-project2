JTPA section 106 requires theSecretary to formulate performance standards applicable to grantees designatedto operate these section 402 programs. (See also 20 CFR 633.321). JTPAsection 402(c)(4) further specifies that<ITAG tagnum="21">Recipients of funds under this section shall establish performancegoals, which shall, to the extent required by the Secretary, comply withperformance standards established by the Secretary pursuant to section106.</ITAG>Department of Labor (DOL or Department) regulations at 20 CFR 633.204(a)(5)identify performance standards as one of fourteen responsibility teststhat MSFW grantees are required to meet in being considered for final selection.By focusing on participant outcomes of the MSFW programs, performance standardscomplement the other program assessment criteria relating to various complianceaspects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Required Performance Measures</ITAG>The Department has established and utilized two required performance standardsfor JTPA Section 402 grantees as follows:andbullet; Entered Employment Rate (EER)_the percentage of total termineesplaced in unsubsidized employment.andbullet; Cost per Entered Employment (CEE)_total expenditures (excludingcosts of administration and costs of ``Services Only'') divided by thetotal number of terminees who entered employment.In calculating these standards, participants in ``Services Only'' and youthswho obtain an employability enhancement outcome are excluded from totalterminations.The Entered Employment Rate (EER) measure reflects the employment orientationof all JTPA programs. The Cost per Entered Employment (CEE) measure holdsgrantees accountable for using their training funds in a cost effectivemanner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Performance standards for MSFW programs were first introduced on a trailbasis in the last year of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act(CETA) (Fiscal Year [FY] 1983, October 1, 1982-September 30, 1983). Thesestandards continued to be used on a developmental basis in these MSFW programsthrough the subsequent periods under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)until the end of PY 1986 (July 1, 1986-June 30, 1987).Program Year 1987 (July 1, 1987-June 30, 1988) was the first year the standardsbecame officially effective for assessing performance of JTPA section 402grantees designated to operate Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker (MSFW) programs.Prior to PY 1987, minimum standards for MSFW grantees were set throughthe use of two previous approaches. From FY 83 through PY 85, a ``clustering''approach was used in which a grantee's standards were set according togiven categories of program size and primary clientele served (i.e. migrantsor seasonals). Because of problems with the clustering approach, an interimprocedure was adopted for PY 1986 by which performance standards were setat 100% of each grantee's actual performance reported for PY 1984 witha 15% end of year variance allowed for both measures (i.e., EER and CEE).Under both of these previous approaches, standards were set primarily onthe basis of taking grantee performance levels in a prior year and applyingthose levels as the minimum standard for the upcoming program period. Thus,grantees who had performed at high levels in the previous year were heldto high standards even though their conditions may have changed in thesubsequent period. Conversely, those grantees performing at lower levelsin previous years had much easier standards with little incentive to improvefrom one year to the next.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rationale for Basic Modeling Approach  </ITAG>From the inception of performance standards, the Department has exploredways to establish a uniform and objective method for setting individualgrantee's standards that accounts for client characteristics and localconditions in each grantee's service area. The statistical technique foraccomplishing this is known as multiple regression analysis. This techniqueis used to develop and update performance standards for the mainline JTPATitle IIA programs operated by the States and local service delivery areas.This same approach is also used to set standards for other JTPA employmentand training programs such as the disclocated worker programs (Title III)and the nationally administered programs (Title IV) operated by Job Corpscenters and by Native American grantees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Basic Modeling Approach  </ITAG>Over a period of several years (PY 1984-85-86) this type of approach wasunder development for MSFW programs including periodic consultation withgrantee representatives. Starting in PY 1987, the Department adopted andimplemented a model-based methodology to set individual grantee standards.Essentially the same statistical models with some minor changes are presentlyin use during the current PY 1988 period (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989. PY 1989 (July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990) will be the third program year inwhich standards are set for MSFW grantees using the multiple regressionmodeling technique. This modeling approach examines the statistical relationshipsbetween program outcomes, terminee characteristics, and local economicconditions in order to identify the important factors which influence granteeresults on each performance measure (i.e., EER and CEE).  Some of these factors are found to be associated with better performanceand other factors are related to weaker performance. Models are then developedthat quantify the relationships between the various factors so that specificadjustments can be calculated for each individual grantee. Adding up thenet effet of all factors in the model for each performance measure provideseach grantee with its own individually adjusted performance standards. For example, if a grantee serves a higher than average proportion of schooldropouts, the model will yield a lower EER, all things being equal, resultingin easier standards for that grantee. However, if a grantee's program servesa higher proportion of high school graduates, then the model produces somewhathigher entered employment rate standards.  In summary, the adjustment model approach offers these advantages:  andbullet; It allows standards to be set on a consistent and equitable basisfor grantees by accounting for a variety of factors affecting performance. andbullet; It reduces inducements for concentrating on the easier to serveparticipants since grantees who serve only job ready participants willbe held to stricter performance standards.  andbullet; It provides grantees with a useful tool in the planning processby estimating performance targets based on their own unique terminee characteristicsand local conditions.  andbullet; It involves no disincentives for superior performance since granteescan be rated as superior performers in one year without making their standardsmore stringent in the subsequent year.  In addition to the above considerations, the model-based standard settingprocess provides MSFW grantees and the Department with objective criteriafor assessing grantee performance on key program outcomes. Thus, well-managedprograms should do better than the model-predicted performance while poorlymanaged programs can be expected to do worse.<ITAG tagnum="84">Selection of Modeling Factors</ITAG>The following criteria have been used to determine which factors are includedin the models.andbullet; Management practices have been excluded because they are regardedas within the control of program managers.andbullet; There must be some variations among grantees on the factor.andbullet; The relationship between the factor and the performance measuremakes intuitive sense.andbullet; The factor is objective and easily quantifiable.andbullet; For local economic conditions, published sub-state level datais available nationwide.Factors appearing in the models use three main types of data includingterminee characteristics, program characteristics, and service area characteristics(local economic conditions). For the PY 1989 models, data have been usedfrom the Annual Status Reports (ASRs) submitted by MSFW grantees for ProgramYears 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987. These reports contain information fromeach grantee on outcomes achieved, services received by terminees, termineecharacteristics, and related fiscal data. Data for local economic factorshave been drawn from reports published by the Bureau of the Census andthe Bureau of Labor Statistics.The following 16 factors have been selected for inclusion in either oneor both of the models for the two required MSFW performance measures inPY 1989:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,5,5</C> <H1>Local factors</H1><H1>Models</H1><H2>EER</H2><H2>CEE</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Pecent Migrants<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Aged 14-21<D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Elementary School Dropouts<D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Black<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Hispanic<D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Welfare Recipients<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Unemployed at Enrollment<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average Weeks Participated<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent receiving Classroom Training<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent in Tryout Employment or Work Experience<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Local Unemployment Rate (Non-MSA)<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent Employment in Manufacturing<D>X</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average Earnings in Manufacturing<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Population living on Farms (Non-MSA)<D/><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Population in Urban Areas (Non-MSA)<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Median Family Income<D>X</D><D>X</D></ITAG></ITAG>Of the 16 factors listed in the table above, 13 of them have been usedin the previous models for PY 1987 and/or PY 1988. <T3>As described below, the three new factors are being added to the CEEfor PY 1989.</T3>Although a number of other possible changes were examined in developingthese PY 1989 models, the factors shown above proved to be the ones thatmake the largest contribution to the model's predictive ability. Also,the retention of these factors in the PY 1989 models make them consistentwith the corresponding models for the given measures in PY 1987 and PY1988. The status of each model and limited changes are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Entered Employment Rate (EER) Model</ITAG>The PY 1989 model for EER contains the same ten factors that were includedin the PY 1988 EER model.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost Per Entered Employment (CEE) Model</ITAG>Nine of the factors listed above for the PY 1989 model are retained fromthe PY 1988 model for the CEE. One of the new factors being added to theCEE model is <T3>Average Earnings in Manufacturing. </T3>This variable has been addedas an additional local economic indicator because it proves to have a strongand significant effect on the cost outcome and makes a fairly sizeablecontribution to the model's overall fit to the data. Moreover, as a measureof average wages for semi-skilled workers in the local labor market, thisvariable is expected to be an important determinant of cost per placement.The other two new factors being added to the CEE model are program activityfactors; namely, <T3>Percent receiving Classroom Training </T3>and <T3>Percent in Tryout Employment or Work Experience. </T3>The reasons foradding these factors to the CEE model are discussed in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Modeling Results</ITAG>In developing the models for PY 1989, special attention has been givento re-examining the question of whether program activity factors (``programmix'') ought to be included. Previously, the Department's position hasbeen that program mix is a matter that falls within management controland, hence, program activity was left out of the models for PY 1987 andPY 1988.However, some grantees have expressed concern that performance standardsmay discourage the use of Classroom Training because it is more expensiveeven though needed and appropriate for a number of participants enrolledin the migrant and seasonal farmworker programs. <T3>In consideration of such concerns, the model-building process for PY1989 specifically addressed the question of how program activity factorswould operate if they were added to the models.</T3>Based on program data reported by all grantees over the last several years,the annual national averages for proportions of MSFW terminees by programactivity levels are shown in the table below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,5,5,5</C> <ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Program years</H1><H2>1984</H2><H2>1985</H2><H2>1986</H2>Percent of Terminees in:<ITAG tagnum="2">Classroom Training<D>37.6</D><D>34.5</D><D>30.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">On-the-Job Training<D>29.6</D><D>30.8</D><D>36.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Training Assistance<D>22.2</D><D>21.8</D><D>21.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Tryout Employment<D>2.0</D><D>1.8</D><D>2.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Work Experience<D>8.7</D><D>11.1</D><D>9.3</D></ITAG></ITAG>The above data indicate a trend towards decreased use of Classroom Trainingand increased use of On-the-Job Training. The other three categories haveremained at the same levels during these years.The detailed data analysis completed as part of the modeling process showsthat those grantees who relied heavily on On-the-Job Training had substantiallyhigher entered employment rates and lower average costs, thereby beingmore likely to having met or exceeded their standards. Leaving programmix out of the model might likely encourage grantees to continue relyingon OJT, thus serving those who are most job ready.Including program mix variables in the EER model proved to have mixed results.If program mix factors were to be added to the EER model, grantees relyingon Classroom Training would be given somewhat easier strandards. However,it would also give far easier standards to grantees who rely heavily onTraining Assistance which is not seen as a desirable policy. Therefore,because of these mixed results, adding program mix to the EER model doesnot serve a useful purpose at this point in time.For the CEE model, the addition of the program activity factors appearsto be more productive. Adding program mix in the CEE model will give granteesrelying on Classroom Training more relaxed cost standards compared to granteesrelying on any of the other program activities. Therefore, program mixis being added to the CEE model as a way to encourage more Classroom Training,particularly for harder-to-serve participants.Another special effort as part of the PY 1989 modeling process was to examinean alternative approach for defining each grantee's service area for purposesof calculating the local economic factors in the models. The Departmentreceived excellent cooperation of MSFW grantees through the Associationof Farmworker Opportunity Programs (AFOP) in collecting data identifyingeach grantee's self-defined service areas within their states. However,the modeling results using the self-defined areas produced estimates forMSFW grantees that were at best on better and in some cases substantiallyworse than the ``non-metropolitan'' county approach used in the currentmodels. Therefore, the previous service area definitions will continueto be used in calculating the local economic factors in the PY 1989 models.<ITAG tagnum="84">Departure Points </ITAG>As part of the modeling process, it is also necessary to establish an overalllevel around which adjustments are made for the various factors includedin each model. These overall levels are referred to as <T3>departure points. </T3>The departure points for each of the measuresare based on the national average performance levels compiled for all granteesduring a given period. In the case of the PY 1987 and PY 1988 models, thetime period used has been <T3>one program year </T3> from which data was most recently available.However, further analysis has shown that using only one program year asthe period for determining departure points can lead to problems if thereare significant shifts up or down in the national averages from one particularyear to the next. In order to avoid or minimize such abrupt shifts fromyear to year, depature points for the PY 1989 models will be based insteadon pooled data over the most recent <T3>three program years.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">End of Transition Period </ITAG>At the time the new model-based process was introduced, the Departmentestablished a two-year transition period (PY 1987 and PY 1988) during whichgrantees' standards would be calculated partially by model adjustmentsand partially by a post performance weight for each measure. The purposewas to provide a way to mitigate changes involved in moving from the oldpast performance approach for setting grantee standards to the new adjustmentmodel methodology. For PY 1987, the weights for past performance were 45% for the EER and49% for the CEE. <T3>For PY 1988, the past performance weights were 25% both for the EERand for the CEE. For PY 1989, the models will no longer include a pastperformance weight since the transition phase is over.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Acceptable Performance Ranges </ITAG>According to procedures previously established for PY 1987 and PY 1988,a range of acceptable performance will be calculated around the performancegoal for each measure in the PY 1989 modeling calculations consisting ofthree levels: andbullet; A <T3>recommended performance goal </T3>that reflects the adjustments forterminee characteristics and other factors for the particular grantee.andbullet; An <T3>exemplary performance level </T3>above the goal. andbullet; A <T3>minimally acceptable level </T3>below the goal which represents theminimum performance the grantee should meet. The size of ranges between minimum, goal, and exemplary levels dependsupon the relative size of the grantee's program (i.e., number of termineesreported). Smaller grantees have wider performance ranges than larger grantees,reflecting the fact that statistics can fluctuate more substantially whenthere are smaller number of participants being served. By using these ranges of acceptable performance, rather than a single level,the performance standards can acknowledge that there are other factorsaffecting performance that are not captured by the models and that maybe outside management control.<ITAG tagnum="84">Experience with PY 1987 Models </ITAG>There has been a continuing pattern of improved performance among MSFWgrantees on each of the two required measures over the last several programyears. This same pattern continued in PY 1987 which marked completion ofthe first program year (July 1, 1987-June 30, 1988) in which model-basedstandards have been used to assess grantee performance. For informationpurposes, the following data indicate how well MSFW grantees performedagainst their model-based levels in PY 1987. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6,6 </C> <ITAG tagnum="96">[In percent] </ITAG><H1>  </H1><H1>EER </H1><H1>CEE </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Exemplary <D>39.6 </D><D>45.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Goal level <D>37.7 </D><D>39.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum standard <D>20.8 </D><D>11.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Below minimum <D>1.9 </D><D>3.8 </D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Percent of total of all grantees <D>100.0 </D><D>100.0 </D></ITAG></ITAG>The proportions of MSFW grantees achieving the better performance ratingsis relatively high and tends to exceed the expected distribution of granteeswhich is estimated at 15 percent exemplary and 15 percent below minimum.Thus, the model-generated levels did not impose overly stringent standardson the MSFW grantees during PY 1987. <ITAG tagnum="84">PY 1989 Planning Instructions </ITAG>The Department expects to provide performance standards worksheets basedon the models described herein so that grantees can use the projected levelsin their planning estimates for PY 1989. Additional planning instructionswill be transmitted to MSFW grantees through a subsequent Farmworker Bulletin.Such instructions will furnish more detailed guidance on the specific provisionsoutlined in this notice together with any further changes that may be adoptedfor PY 1989. <ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this 16 day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
