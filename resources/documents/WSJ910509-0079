Administration officials said the leading contender tosucceed Mr. Webster, who was appointed by President RonaldReagan in 1987, is Deputy National Security Adviser RobertGates, a former deputy CIA chief. Also reportedly underconsideration is James Lilley, ambassador to China, anotherformer CIA official and a friend of the president. Officialssay Mr. Bush also may be considering former intelligenceofficial Bobby Inman, and surprise candidates such as NewHampshire Republican Sen. Warren Rudman.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gates wants the top intelligence job, officials say.He was nominated for the post before Mr. Webster, butwithdrew his name because of criticism that he failed to haltsecret arms sales to Iran during the Reagan years. Officialspredict his cause is likely to be boosted by NationalSecurity Adviser Brent Scowcroft, with whom he has workedexceptionally closely since the beginning of the Bushadministration.   Asked about a Gates appointment, the president said, &quot;Ihaven't considered successors yet,&quot; but he called Mr. Gates&quot;a worthy man&quot; and said, &quot;We all have great respect for him.&quot;   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D.,Okla.), who was a critic of Mr. Gates in 1987, said, &quot;If thepresident were to nominate Bob Gates, my inclination would beto support him.&quot; He said that the Iran scandal investigations&quot;never found anything that raised questions about his {Mr.Gates'} involvement.&quot; Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine), who isinfluential on intelligence issues, also said, &quot;I think Gatesshould get the job.&quot;   Mr. Bush said the Webster resignation was the 67-year-oldCIA chief's idea, and was made final in a telephone callTuesday night. At an early morning news conference yesterday,the president went out of his way to stress that Mr. Websterwasn't being forced out.   &quot;He has done a superb job,&quot; the president declared. &quot;Ihate to see him go.&quot; He said the departure was unrelated toany criticism of the intelligence community performanceduring the Persian Gulf war, asserting that &quot;the intelligencewas outstanding and the community performed fantastically.&quot;He declared, &quot;I have no complaints whatsoever about thequality of our intelligence.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Webster, a former Federal Bureau ofInvestigation director and longtime federal judge, said, &quot;Ican tell you categorically that no one has suggested to methat it was time to go, certainly not the president or anyoneacting on his behalf.&quot;   He said he acted for personal reasons, including a desireto practice law. But he also added that, ever since Mr. Bushasked him following the 1988 election to remain at the CIA,&quot;I knew that at some point he would probably like toinvigorate his own administration by appointing someone ofhis own choice.&quot;   Mr. Webster said he wanted to move now because &quot;the warhas just been completed, we're adjusting to a very differentkind of world, and I am coming up on four years in the job&quot;May 26.   CIA officials praised Mr. Webster for improving thegovernment's efforts against terrorism, narcotics dealing,and foreign spying.   Nevertheless, the resignation comes at a time when privatesniping at Mr. Webster is mounting. Mr. Scowcroft and otherWhite House officials privately have been critical of thelow-key intelligence boss, who is seen as too close toCongress and insufficiently aggressive.   Mr. Webster's strong support in Congress has faded a bitin recent months as well. The CIA has been criticized forfailing to flatly predict Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and Mr.Webster wasn't a visible figure in the planning and conductof the war.   There have been news reports based on these criticisms,but the president himself has supported Mr. Websterrepeatedly. Mr. Bush, who was a cautious figure himselfduring his own tenure at the CIA in the 1970s, said yesterdaythat he doesn't believe the CIA chief should seek to asserthimself as a policy maker.   Both congressional intelligence committees currently aremounting efforts to reorganize the spy agencies Mr. Websteroversees, with the aim in part of creating a strongerdirector's post. Rep. David McCurdy (D., Okla.), chairman ofthe house panel, praised Mr. Webster for starting to move theagency in the right direction. But he said, &quot;It probably isan appropriate time to hand over the reins to someone else aswe head into reorganization.&quot;   Mr. Webster was widely praised yesterday as honest andwilling to accept congressional oversight, in contrast to hispredecessor, William Casey.</TEXT></DOC>
