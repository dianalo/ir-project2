Theseimprovements have been obtained despite a substantially sublinear increasein cell short-circuit current with increasing solar concentration. Thetheory of operation of cells of this type under short circuit is outlined.This theory accurately describes the observed current sublinearity andindicates how it can be eliminated.</TEXT></DOC>
