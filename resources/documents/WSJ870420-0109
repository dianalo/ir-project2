But when the company's executives conclude a contract with a TV or radio station, they fly to Chicago for the signing.    That is because Illinois, where Rasmussen has its production studio, has a lower corporate income-tax rate than Florida -- 4% compared with 5.5%. Moreover, when deciding what portion of a company's profit is subject to its income tax, Florida uses a formula that weights sales clinched in the Sunshine State twice as heavily as Illinois weights sales concluded within its borders.    &quot;We've been looking at exactly where our income is earned, rather than just assuming it's been in Florida where we're incorporated,&quot; says E. Patricia Killory, Rasmussen's vice president of finance. &quot;We're trying to shift as much of our income as possible to Illinois.&quot;    Increasingly, small companies like Rasmussen are taking greater pains to manage -- and minimize -- their state income-tax burdens. &quot;Most businesses focus on their federal income taxes,&quot; says Victor V. Coppola, director of national emerging-business services for the accounting firm of Coopers andamp; Lybrand. &quot;More and more, I'm seeing companies focus on their state income taxes.&quot;    THE SHIFT IN FOCUS stems from several factors. State income-tax rates have risen in recent years as states have sought money to offset cutbacks in revenue-sharing and other federal funds. For the same reason, state tax agencies have become more aggressive in enforcement and audit efforts.    The prime cause of the shift, however, is the new federal tax law. By lowering the top federal corporate rate to 34% from 46%, the legislation effectively made state taxes more costly by reducing their value as a deduction on the federal return. &quot;A dollar in state taxes used to cost you 54 cents out of pocket,&quot; says Joseph J. Nugent, Coopers andamp; Lybrand's regional director of state and local taxes in Philadelphia. &quot;Now it's going to cost 66 cents.&quot;    Moreover, the new federal law indirectly raised state income taxes by wiping out many deductions. Most states allow only the deductions the federal government allows, so deductions lost on the federal level were lost on the state level, too. The resulting changes are expected to add at least $1 billion -- and perhaps as much as $2.5 billion -- to the approximately $18 billion corporations pay annually in state income taxes.    The impact of the federal tax overhaul was &quot;the straw that broke the camel's back,&quot; says Gerrold S. Gattegno, director of the multi-state tax practice at Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells. &quot;If somebody wasn't thinking about state taxes before, they certainly are now.&quot;    BUSINESS OWNERS are using a variety of strategies to trim their state tax bills. For companies that do business in more than one state, one approach is to tinker with the formula by which income is allocated among each state. The formula is based on the amount of property, employees and sales a company has in each state.    A New Jersey data-processing company, for example, has restructured into a holding company with two subsidiaries, one that owns the computers and another that employs the national sales force.    Previously, the extent of its assets in New Jersey required the company to report most of its income in that state, where the tax rate is a hefty 9%. With its salesmen and service force in a separate subsidiary, the company now can allocate more income to lower-tax states where they actually conclude sales. As a result, the company has trimmed its consolidated state tax rate to 6.2% from 7.5%.    Some strategies are ideally suited to small businesses. For example, when a small Pennsylvania cosmetics company recently went public, it first set up an investment holding company in Delaware to hold the cash from the offering until it was needed for working capital. That is because interest and other investment income aren't taxable in Delaware but are in Pennsylvania.    OTHER STRATEGIES INCLUDE separately incorporating profitable operations in low-tax states, merging less-profitable operations with profitable ones in high-tax states and setting intercompany transfer pricing at favorable levels. Establishing financing, sales, management, or other types of subsidiaries in states with low rates also can produce tax savings.    However, warns Coopers andamp; Lybrand's Mr. Coppola, a company shouldn't make decisions affecting where income is taxed until it has analyzed the impact on other state levies, such as property, payroll and sales taxes. &quot;To focus solely on income tax might be missing the ball,&quot; he says. &quot;The total state tax picture should be looked at.&quot;    Accountants also warn that tax decisions favorable in one state could be harmful in another. For example, not all states recognize S corporations, which pay taxes on business income at personal-income rates.    Electing to become an S corporation could be favorable if personal rates are lower than corporate rates. But under certain circumstances, a business that makes an S election could wind up paying double state taxes on part of its income, says Leonard Powers, director of state and local taxes at Arthur Anderson andamp; Co.    &quot;When a small business starts moving into a multi-state environment,&quot; Mr. Powers warns, &quot;the tax question becomes more than just a puzzle. It's a kaleidoscope. It's constantly changing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
