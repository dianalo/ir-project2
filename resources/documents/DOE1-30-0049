(B) Development ofmaterials for component devices: Conceptual design of the future plantwas studied aiming principally at low cost. In the current conceptualdesign, the specifications of the actual plant were determined by usinga light weight devices and molten salt heat storage devices of sensibleheat type employed as the solar concentrator and heat collector, andthe cost-reducing effect was also evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
