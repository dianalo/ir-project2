First,Inho Park has obtained results for quasi-mode decay at lower hybrid geometricfoci using an analytic model. Many lower hybrid rays have been tracedto assess the wide occurrence of true geometric line foci. Three regimesfor daughter wave amplification have been identified in three regionsof the foci. The problem of obtaining realistic pump wave amplitudesis clearly defined and cannot be obtained from focusing. Second, a lowerhybrid ray tracing code has been built for ETR, using a numerical equilibrium.The last details of coding up and graphics generation are being workedout. The goal is to study both current drive and the possibility to burnthrough the distribution functions to improve accessibility. For theremainder of this grant period we will start work on Ion Bernstein WaveHeating in collaboration with Oak Ridge.</TEXT></DOC>
