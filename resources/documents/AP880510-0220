Complete results showed a small setback for the socialistopposition but no gain for Prime Minister Poul Schlueter'scenter-right minority coalition in the 179-member Folketing, orParliament.   Schlueter had called the early election hoping to win a clearendorsement of Denmark's ``full membership'' in the North AtlanticTreaty Organization.   The Social Democrats, Denmark's largest party, pushed through aresolution in Parliament last month designed to reinforce a 1957peacetime ban on nuclear weapons on Danish territory. Both theUnited States and Britain had expressed opposition to the measure.   Only the far-right Progress Party, campaigning for lower taxesand less immigration, improved its standing. It won 16 seats, sevenmore than it had held before.   Schlueter's Conservative party dropped three seats, holding 35,but they were picked up by other parties in the four-partycoalition and the alliance held on to its 70-seat total.   The two-party socialist partnership lost two seats to command79. The Social Democrats will hold 55 seats and the SocialistPeople's Party 24.   The swing party Social-Liberals held 10, a loss of one.   Two semi-independent territories, the Faeroe Islands andGreenland, each elect two representativs.   Final results showed 3,913,318 ballts were cast for a turnout of85.8 percent.   Schlueter claimed the results would ease Denmark's crisis withNATO.   But Social Democratic leader Svend Auken said the electionshowed most voters backed the anti-nuclear measure that requiresthe government to notify visiting warships of Denmark's 1957 banagainst nuclear weapons during peacetime.   Auken said he would continue the battle in the legislature toimplement the resolution. The precise wording of the letter to besent to ship captains remains to be drafted.   Schlueter, in a television appearance, called on Auken toquietly negotiate ``a sensible solution'' to the issue thatprompted the early election only eight months after the previousballoting.   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the coalition'sLiberal Party, said he believed Schlueter's government couldcontinue.   ``There is still a non-socialist majority,'' he told atelevision interviewer. The other coalition members are the CenterDemocratic and Christian People's parties.   Twelve parties contested the election, but only nine won seats.   Clearly elated, Progress Party leader Morgans Glistrup said hisvictory ``was good for the country.''   However, the party was not expected to be a factor in coalitionbargaining since it is shunned by mainstream politicians.   Every Danish government since 1973 has lacked a majority inParliament, and Danish politics usually are managed throughbackstage bargaining.   Before the Social Democrat resolution passed last month, Denmarktook the position that its NATO allies abided by the rulesestablished in 1957.   The United States and Britain said the measure threatened thesolidarity of the Western military alliance and was against theirown policies, which forbid disclosure of which ships carry nucleararms.   Britain said the Danish action jeopardized its plans to sendtroops in times of crisis to reinforce Denmark, which controls thenarrow access to the Baltic Sea.   Unless the resolution is overturned by the new Parliament, thegovernment will have to carry it out, after the wording has beendetermined.   Schlueter has indicated he would follow the Norwegian model.Norway, also a NATO country with a peacetime nuclear ban, remindsallies that their ships are expected to abide by Norwegian law butdoes not explicitly mention nuclear weapons.   The election came the day before Secretary of State GeorgeShultz was to meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze inGeneva to prepare for a Moscow summit in two weeks.   The nuclear issue ``couldn't come at a worse time,'' said adiplomat from a NATO country, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   A perception that Denmark is wavering in its support of theWestern alliance could strenghthen the Soviets' hand.   During the campaign, most coalition parties focused on the NATOissue.   However, the opposition stressed economic concerns, on which itmade some gains in the September election.</TEXT></DOC>
