Reading the Supreme Court's right-to-die decision and itstwo abortion decisions Monday, it is not clear to us that theindividual members of a society are going to be better servednow that judges have replaced angels atop humankind'stouchiest moral problems. Let's set aside for now thequestion of whether the Court was right that an individualcan refuse medical treatment but that Nancy Cruzan's&quot;somewhat serious conversation with a housemate friend&quot;didn't meet Missouri's &quot;heightened evidentiary requirements&quot;;or that an abortion law with parental notification isconstitutional if the minor can talk to a judge as analternative.</LP><TEXT>   We are more struck by the fact that the Supreme Court andcourts generally have become the institution to which so manypeople now turn for guidance on problems of conscience andmorality.   Several years ago, we sat in a federal courtroom on LongIsland and watched an appeals-court judge listen to lawyerslitigate one of the Baby Doe cases. The judge heard aboutmedicine, the rights of infants, the duties of parents andthe obligations of society. At last the judge said that likeother cases now, this one was quite beyond the law's skillsor precedents but that the litigants, their supporters andthe media had gathered on this occasion and wanted him tosomehow figure it all out and render a decision. So he did.Indeed one of the best right-to-die decisions we've read wasby a New Jersey state judge who just wrote out some sensible,personal thoughts on the subject.   Courts have assumed this function partly by volition butpartly by default. Courtrooms have become the last refuge ofa society that has gradually lost faith in the ability of theinstitutions that used to provide a coherent framework withinwhich an individual could form moral or ethical opinions andreach conclusions.   As the 2 Live Crew and NEA controversy indicates, thecontemporary moral philosophy of many intellectual leadersis, anything goes. They are little help. Over the last 15years, the established Christian churches have abdicatedtheir authority in the area of individual moralresponsibility, choosing instead to promote &quot;social-justiceissues,&quot; which make the churches mainly an adjunct to secularpolitics and sociology.   Few reporters bothered to call a minister or priest forcomment on the right-to-die case. They quite sensibly calledthe groups who now do what thinking exists on these personalquestions, such as the United Handicapped Federation orConcern for the Dying. Indeed as we've argued before, some ofthese movements and groups, like the Sierra Club or Friendsof Animals, now give their members the purposefulness onceprovided by the churches. But there is an importantdifference: Where the churches relied heavily on personalconscience, their successors rely on the courts.   &quot;There are some wonderful things here,&quot; the director oflegal services for the Society for the Right to Die said ofthe Missouri decision. &quot;The Constitution is being applied ina brand new and revolutionary way.&quot;   We don't see how it can be regarded as good to have theU.S. Constitution transformed into Holy Writ and judgesserving as confessors for a morally perplexed society.Justice Scalia pointedly warned in his concurrence that ifthe Court insisted on injecting itself into every field ofhuman activity where irrationality and oppression maytheoretically occur, &quot;it will destroy itself.&quot;   There is no denying that advances in areas such asmedicine have made judgment in some painful circumstancesseem more difficult. Up to a point, legislatures reflecting apublicly debated consensus have to set some rules. We do notsee, though, how an advanced society is going to maintain itssense of what is morally right or wrong if it becomes whollydependent on courts whose own source of inspiration, as here,is Twin City Bank v. Nebeker (1897).</TEXT></DOC>
