(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Security is wonderful stuff.andP;  Linus has his blanket and America has thewonderfully named Mutually Assured Destruction nuclear capability.andP;  if youthink that this means that some security is useless and some may be overkill,you're right.andM;If you think that this means that all security is worthless, guess again.andO;Linus' blanket kept away the elephants or whatever.andP;  The nuclear alternativemay have been the wisest alternative when the West had bombasticpolitical-economic opponents whose stated goal was the forceful overthrow&quot;Capitalism.&quot; A position about which Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson andNixon agreed should not be lightly dismissed (not to ignore Churchill,DeGaulle, Adenauer and quite a few others of general respect).andM;Back to the simpler world of LANS, however with two morals.andP;  Some &quot;security&quot;is mythical, and some is simply too expensive.andP;  For any particular network,what is mythical and what is too expensive and what is just right dependsupon the user mix and the data being dealt with.andP;  The right solution isachieved making an educated guess about who might try to invade your networkand how they might accomplish it.andP;  Then establish how much it costs toprotect against them.andP;  By balancing these estimates against the potentiallosses represented by data theft or vandalism one can arrive at what securitymethods are beneficial.andM;Before looking at products, it is important to differentiate between securityby prevention and security by detection of incursions and repair orreplacement of damage.andM;In automobiles ignition locks and intrusion alarms are security items.andP;  Doorlocks prevent problems.andP;  Alarms detect and report incursions.andP;  Prevention isalmost always more difficult and costly than detection.andP;  The auto analogyslips a bit here as all cars have locks and alarms are often an addedexpense.andP;  If the average car were delivered with neither locks nor alarms youmight see a lot of cars with no locks but with alarms.andM;Computer systems present a unique situation in that most damage is easily andeconomically repaired from backups if the damage is detected and reported.andO;This means detection is often a much better security strategy for computersecurity systems.andP;  In contrast security for the Hope diamond must place a lotmore emphasis on prevention as there aren't any backups for the Hope diamond.andM;Network security deals with defenses against a person and/or a program whichintends theft of information, programs, computer time or vandalism.andP;  Suchdamage can arise from security weaknesses in any of four somewhat separateareas: local connections, remote connections, servers and workstations.andP;  ifeach of these areas is secured against any likely attack, the network may beconsidered secure.andM;Local ConnectionsandM;If the information being routed through the local links is valuable enough tosomeone who shouldn't have it, you have a problem which perhaps ought to beaddressed.andM;To secure local lines by preventing inappropriate access you can make theminaccessible (bury them in concrete?) or encrypt the data going through them.andM;Encryption, the scrambling of information before it is sent to a file oralong the network, is one of the best security methods for local links.andO;Although encryption doesn't prevent local line tapping, it generally defeatsthe value of tapping lines.andM;Ordinary physical security should not be ignored.andP;  The regular securitypeople should check out any people working on baseboards or false ceilings.andO;If you are serious about security you better start working with the plantsecurity staff.andM;To detect local link intrusions one could consider a daily analysis with anyof several LAN monitors and time domain reflectometers  TDRs).andP;  Any change inconfiguration or station location, station configuration, interface cards orespecially line length must be one that the network manager expectedotherwise something extremely strange is happening and it should be lookedinto.andM;Reliability and fault tolerance fight security sometimes.andP;  This is true withcommunications (this is also true in a particularly ironic way for servers).andO;With regard to communications, much effort is placed on automatic retries andreestablishing communications after error bursts.andP;  These efforts have largelybeen successful and have greatly enhanced network usability.andP;  For instance,when an Ethernet line is cut, if it is rapidly reconnected, often there willbe no effect for the users or the network.andP;  This is great for most situationsand also great for someone installing an unauthorized splice.andM;LAN monitors have not yet gotten to the level where they are efficient forsecurity.andP;  Probably within a year we will see product offerings where a LANmonitor will raise an alarm and insist upon human authorization whenever thenetwork configuration changes, impedances shift, time delays alter, etc.andP;  Anyalteration should cause a request for human authorization.andP;  Failingauthorization the network should be automatically guided to a gracefulshutdown.andP;  The hardware to let a network administrator lock a network into astatic configuration is available now.andP;  Unfortunately the software isn't yet.andO;Remote ConnectionsandM;Remote connections, particularly through commercial data carriers, are highlyinsecure.andP;  Microwave links, cables and satellite communications are laughablysusceptible to tapping.andP;  If your information must remain secure, encryptionis the only answer.andM;Remote network access has been a great boon for training, service and supportof networks.andP;  Remote access packages are extremely useful and convenient sonaturally they are security disasters.andP;  (General rule: anything extremelyuseful and convenient that deals with sensitive data is a security disaster).andM;One should restrict all modem communications to packages or modems which dialthe user back after accepting a request for a call.andP;  This will hamper thestyle of hackers who dial numbers until they get a dial tone and then starttrying to break into the system, for sport or profit.andP;  Even then, as I havegreat respect for the abilities of phone freaks to warp the intents of thephone system, the best security is provided by not having remote access atall.andP;  Second best is to have a person responsible for turning a modem on atthe beginning of a session and turning it off when the session is complete.andM;Regarding password retries at login, if you can, reduce the number of retriesto none.andP;  Allowing two or three retries encourages hackers and bad typing.andO;Certainly most of your users will rapidly adapt to typing their passwordcorrectly the first time.andP;  A superior strategy is to allow a large number ofretries, but only the first one actually will log one in.andP;  If anyone triesthe second time and beyond the event is treated as an incursion.andM;ServersandM;Server command structures are similar to widely known DOS or UNIX commands,the manuals for server commands are widely available and help screens assistthe novice.andP;  This took a lot of work.andP;  Ease of use, it's called.andP;  It isperfect for most environments and ridiculous for security, unless there isextremely good perimeter security.andP;  Servers, although they have passwordprotection are generally without trace or unusual activity traps after alogin stage is passed.andP;  Most are totally unprotected against disk removal.andO;All it takes is a screwdriver.andM;The success of various manufacturers in making easy-to-use (so to speak),general-purpose repositories of information for a variety of attachedcomputers has been key to the phenomenal contributions and growth ofnetworking.andP;  Remember our general rule? An easy to use, standardized, easy toaccess, central resource with sensitive information is a security nightmare.andM;Preventing security problems with servers is generally a matter of preventingaccess, i.e.andP;  lock them in a room, cabinet or box of some kind.andM;The ironic ultimate in the conflict between fault tolerance and securitycomes in here.andP;  With full server mirroring, an unguarded server could bebrought down, unplugged and removed, data intact, and the network wouldn'tskip a beat as long as everything is mirrored.andP;  it is quite possible that noone would notice for some time.andM;Apricot's Titan is the first server with significant built-in securityfeatures: the &quot;QI&quot; infrared card system grants users privileges to usediskettes, or the hard disks, or networking depending upon the user and timeof day and day of week.andP;  The cabinet is wired with intrusion alarms.andP;  Apricotis the first major manufacturer who has decided to take security seriously.andM;Apricot's server also can make the server passwords different from networkadministrator passwords.andP;  This will be a useful distinction in the future asthe administrative tasks for a network and a server will rapidly fragmentinto clerical routines such as adding a user or altering rights; andtechnical as in adding a value-added process  (VAP), changing printers, orexpanding cache.andM;Encryption is fully supported at the server by QI level two, due for releasethis fall.andM;Detecting server intrusions, aside from Apricot's alarm system, is a bit moredifficult.andP;  Audit trail packages to date focus on a standard DOS environment,e.g.andP;  workstations.andP;  The uniqueness of a dedicated server, along with itsspeed, is that it is not quite standard DOS and the audit facilities may notwork correctly.andP;  in the famous IBM phrase, &quot;The results may beunpredictable.&quot;andM;In the PC LAN world, peer-to-peer network architectures have an advantage.andO;Peer-to-peer PC LANs often have a high degree of DOS compatibility and thereis a good chance that DOS-based, aftermarket, security packages wouldcontribute to &quot;server&quot; security.andP;  Command Software Systems' set of securityproducts, for example, would contribute to security for a DOS compatibleserver but they may be less useful on a NetWare server.andM;WorkstationsandM;Workstations are the most vulnerable aspect of a network, from a securitypoint of view.andP;  People with a security orientation consider a workstation asmall, general-purpose computer with which to attack a network.andP;  An intrudercouldn't ask for a much better tool to assist in cracking network security.andM;As Michael Hurwicz mentioned in &quot;The Sniffer Threat&quot; in the April, 1988 issueof LAN Magazine, it is possible for a villain to use an elegantly programmedworkstation to monitor network activity for the following questionablepurposes:andM;* Provide a local database of login/password packets.andM;* Capture all activity from a workstation or about certain resources, e.g.andO;all the activity from the chief arbitrageur.andM;* Capture all activity about a certain resources type, e.g.andP;  all *.DOC files.andM;Even without sophisticated security cracking hardware and software, the muchvaunted security of some  our most major LAN OS suppliers is of dubiousdesign.andP;  Remember folks who brought you the software which replaced Novell'skeycards? Now their advertisements in prominent computer magazines promise to&quot;remind you&quot; of forgotten passwords.andP;  The passwords they &quot;remind you&quot; of areones you may never have previously seen, such as for Supervisor.andM;Let's get back from determined, financed and expert network securitycracking.andP;  Most networks don't have users who are sophisticated enough ormotivated to use such extremes for cracking network security.andM;Many networks have no external communications and a mature user base with aweak knowledge of DOS and LAN OS commands.andP;  They may be quite expert in wordprocessing, spreadsheet use and that is all that is necessary for their jobs.andO;For these users a menuing system, such as the Saber Menu System or LANSystems' LAN Shell is sufficient to keep the users away from DOS and LAN OScommands and thus out of sensitive areas.andP;  With these the user may beconfined to a few programs.andP;  Since most users are not motivated to crack thenetwork security and there is no exposure to dial-in difficulties, this mayprovide sufficient security.andM;Users and management are generally happier with a good menuing system as itgets their job done with the least amount of hassle, training and keystrokes.andO;Some of these systems allow for workgroup views, license metering, audittrails and other features.andP;  These systems will provide the right security formany networks when used in conjunction with the proper and skilledapplication of passwords, and assignment of users' privileges and rights.andM;Other networks have much more sensitive or critical information.andP;  An examplewould be any system with tradable financial information (insiderinformation).andP;  in a world where someone can make hundreds of millions tradingon insider information, and many millions which depend on minor shifts inhostile takeover bids, it can be worth a great deal for a white collarcriminal to find out what's going on a few days before anyone else.andM;Financial profit does not have to be the motive.andP;  There are white collarvandals as well.andP;  Some people think it cool to crack network security.andM;The potential profit for cracking security and the potential for vandalismmust be evaluated.andP;  if someone with access to all your information could makemillions with it, then the expenses of a LAN monitor or similar gear aretrivial for the white collar crook.andP;  if your users are likely to have aperson who would enjoy trashing the system and you ignore the situation,you're likely to have problems.andP;  The more skilled and intelligent the crookor vandal the less likelihood of traces and the more random will be thedamage.andM;Fortunately there are a variety of good preventive defenses for workstations.andO;The best is encryption of data.andP;  Encryption can be performed with a varietyof products.andP;  Any such product must be checked for LAN OS and DOScompatibility.andM;The amount of resource utilization (RAM, extended memory and processor) mustbe acceptable.andP;  Correct handling of temporary files such as those Microsoft'sWord creates when spell checking must be verified.andP;  it doesn't do any good toencrypt files in one area when temporary copies are left in clear text inanother.andM;DCA's 10Net LAN operating system has encryption built in, a real plus forsecurity conscious environments.andP;  The new Apricot line of workstations andservers with the QI Level 11 will also have encryption for users or groups.andO;Aftermarket encryption products such as those from Lattice and CommandSoftware tighten up security in other environments.andM;&quot;Encryption&quot; can mean almost anything.andP;  The techniques may range fromcharacter scrambling not much more complex than a Commander Cody SecretMessage Ring to really effective ones.andP;  The buzzwords for &quot;good&quot; encryptionare DES (Data Encryption Standard) and CCEP (Commercial Computer EncryptionProgram).andM;DES is the old standard.andP;  There are many applications and systems which haveDES (often in silicon) encryption.andP;  CCEP is a coming standard which may beprimarily used for classified environments.andP;  Watch for more CCEP news.andM;Encryption solves many problems but is not very useful if login or bootprocedures are not sufficiently protected.andP;  The Apricot  &quot;QI&quot; workstation hasbuilt in, credit-card size infrared login control which allows individual orgroups of users access to different system facilities: networking, hard diskor diskette at different times and days of the week.andP;  Add-on packages can beexcellent as well.andP;  Workstation security package such as those from SaberSoftware and Command Software Systems provide a variety of excellent featuressuch as boot passwords, screen blanking while running a program, automaticlocking after a quiet period, audit trails, etc.andM;Biometrics is a growing field pertinent to startup procedures.andP;  The devicesin this interesting arena sample some aspect of the user rather than what theuser remembers or carries.andP;  Biometric products scan signatures, voice prints,retinal maps, fingerprints or hand geometry.andP;  Some are hooked straight intoboot processes.andP;  Most of the products were originally developed for physicalaccess security (doors), but as the marginal costs decrease due toengineering amortization and decreasing chip prices, the biometric deviceswill become reasonable for a much wider range of applications: PC userverification, home locking systems, etc.andP;  If your data's sensitivity requiresextreme precautions, you should look into this area.andP;  The costs are down anddropping.andM;If one is securing a system to this level, one needs to ascertain whether thesecurity can be bypassed by replacing pieces, by replacing a component in thesystem or by providing a different boot diskette.andP;  One should keep in mindthat it is pretty easy to open most workstations and remove or replace cards,and very easy to replace a boot disk.andP;  Also it is simplicity itself to walkup to a workstation, unhook the T connector and plug in a laptop with anetwork interface card.andM;Users' attitudes shift when they use a network with QI security, aftermarketproducts or biometric devices.andP;  When users realize that security is importantthey are far less likely to leave passwords pasted onto workstations, rungames and let friends in to do resumes.andP;  It is almost worthwhile to establishsecurity and maybe even some audit trails just to get users to treat thenetwork more like a corporate resource with valuable information on it.andM;One shouldn't ignore locking up the workstation or the data.andP;  There arehighly secure workstation cabinets such as the product line from Data-Mate.andO;It would be quite a challenge to get at a workstation which is locked up in acase hardened steel cabinet without someone hearing the racket (depending onhow easy the lock is to pick).andP;  My master locksmith friend Al Haistings saysthat the key to the situation is a really good lock.andP;  He likes puns likethat.andM;Finally, for really high security, remove the disks.andP;  High securitygovernmental installations wouldn't dream of installing a fixed drive.andP;  ABernoulli drive in a Tempest (radiation-free) PC is the only way to go.andM;It is just a student project to arrange for a handshaking routine so that auser can only log on to a network only with a particular disk.andP;  if the diskis removable as well, when the user is finished for the day, they remove thedisk and return it to the area where the uniformed mugs with AR-15s, Uzzis orKalishnikovs check the face against a picture book and log the disk in.andO;There's simply no security system better than one enforced by the big mugswith assault rifles.andM;To detect unauthorized activity on a workstation the usual approach is anaudit trail.andP;  Some network operating systems have audit trail capabilities,primarily for login or privilege changing commands.andP;  There are excellentaftermarket packages for audit trails such as LAN Services' LANtrail, theCommand Software products and Triad Plus from Micronyx.andP;  Adding audit trailsof who runs what program on what files to any object-oriented operatingsystem interface such as LAN Systems ReferencePoint would be easy for asystem administrator.andP;  Furthermore LAN Systems has recently announced aReferencePoint upgrade which supports audit trails for various activities.andM;Audit trails are not quite the same as detection.andP;  Depending on the package,the data acquired, and the data reduction programs provided it may be easy ornext to impossible to discover who did what to make things go wrong.andP;  Theprimary problem with the early audit trail packages is that they simplylogged everything.andP;  They couldn't recognize questionable activity.andP;  Thereports were too voluminous to go through even if something went wrong.andP;  Mostcurrent audit trail packages have markedly improved data reduction andanalysis capabilities but, as far as I can tell, we are still waiting for thepackage which is sophisticated enough to log only suspect activity, silently,without informing the user that they are transgressing approved procedures.andO;Programmatic AttacksandM;So far we've mostly discussed what users can do to a system.andP;  We shouldn'tforget our old friends, trojan horses and viruses.andP;  Authorized personnel maymisuse their privileges to leave trojan horses - code which performs actionother than the expected.andP;  The detection solution for this problem is sourcemanagement and control systems such as those from Mortice Kerns Systems andPolytron.andP;  The prevention solution would be to treat programmers fairly wellmanaged staff rarely leave trojan horses.andP;  The two together are the bestsecurity against a dishonest employee.andP;  However even the two together are notprotection against an unbalanced and skillful programmer.andM;A most devious trojan horse is a small program which emulates the logonsequence, posts the user's name and passwords to a database and then pretendsthere was some sort of error and asks the user to log in again, or it rebootsthe workstation.andP;  First sighted, as far as I know, on the Dartmouth TimeShare System about 1966.andP;  Venerable and unfortunately simple and effective.andM;The way to prevent problems from such programs is really rather simple.andO;Unauthorized programs are deleted.andP;  Periodically sweep the network deletingEXEs and COM files which are not in approved areas.andP;  Sweep workstation harddrives at logon or daily doing the same thing.andP;  Doing this will also reducethe risk of exposure to the other nasty type of program: viruses.andM;The noise about viruses has quieted down some.andP;  This is good.andP;  Viruses arestill somewhat rare, and during the hype some situations identified asviruses by &quot;experts&quot; and expert organizations&quot; which were bad disk handling,and some which were ordinary results of encryption programs.andP;  One leading&quot;expert&quot; in England was found to be shipping viruses with his demonstrationdisk.andP;  His reputation suffered.andP;  At least he wasn't crying &quot;Wolf!&quot; needlessly- he sent the wolf in first just to prove his point.andM;The two methods for combating viruses are, naturally, prevention anddetection.andP;  Each represents a different philosophy, each has a basic flaw.andO;The flaws in the prevention techniques is that the methods for checking onlyrefer to past viruses and they consume system resources - RAM, EMM andprocessor time.andP;  That is if they are any good at all.andP;  Some of them are veryintrusive into ordinary applications that.andM;The basic problem with the detection systems is that they generally pullperiodic checks.andP;  During the ween checks the system is vulnerableandM;The categories fast and slow acting have been used for viruses.andP;  With fastacting viruses everything can go to hell in a handbasket real quickly.andO;Although this is sure to cause some inconvenience, at least the networkmanager rapidly figures out that something is wrong and can fix it promptlywith backups.andM;Slow acting are by far the worst, if not caught and eliminated.andP;  They arequiescent,  perhaps except for replicating themselves and only infrequentlydo a little damage.andP;  These are nasty because they look like intermittenthardware or software failures and so are much more difficult to trace andtrap.andM;Unfortunately, to assume that your network won't be exposed to a virus attackis equivalent to assuming that all skillful programmers will eschewantisocial behavior and all corporations and governments will avoid dirtytricks and techno-terrorism.andP;  Judging from history, the prospects for acomputer-virus free world are bleak.andP;  For network managers the problem ofselecting an anti-virus program is made worse by the fact that techniqueswhich are adequate for a single skilled user are often inadequate or flat outinvalid for networks.andM;When selecting among  virus protection&quot; methods:andM;If the producer will not tell you exactly how it does its work and deliversamples of how to monitor its work, that package should be considered a scam.andO;Secret techniques are only a valid argument if the manufacturer can site anapproval from the Department of Defense or if you have the contacts andclearance to verify the product with someone qualified at some place like theCIA, National Security Council or M15 the British organization responsiblefor spies outside the United Kingdom).andM;If the package has been on a bulletin board it may contain a virus and allthe world's psycho-programmers have had a chance to crack it.andM;If you cannot get a reference to a network manager that is using it, it maybe useless on networks.andM;Using these criteria you have a much better chance of getting a package whichactually does some good.andP;  John MacAfee and the Computer Virus industryAssociation provide the best public source of information about the currentstate of the virus wars.andP;  insuranceandM;If someone or a program has trashed your data, there may be some financialrelief.andP;  Many commercial sites carry insurance, and some insurance policieshave &quot;loss of data&quot; sections.andP;  These policies may pay a considerable sum forthe problems caused by viruses or other security breaks.andP;  The Fireman's Fundsays their policies regarding loss of data does not exclude viruses.andP;  I thinkthis means that virus damage is covered as long as reasonable precautionshave been taken.andM;It is worthwhile to read the policy carefully to discover what incidents areexcluded from coverage.andP;  You may discover that some situations are coveredwhich will help to develop the best security and problem recovery plan foryour site.andM;People and Legal FactorsandM;Don't buy any hardware or software until you've circulated the memo whichsays &quot;This is what the network is for and these are things you are notsupposed to do on the network.&quot; Most organizations haven't.andM;It may surprise you, but until you do this, the company may be liable forsoftware theft from the network.andP;  Some rather gross violations of assumedethics may not even be prosecutable.andP;  Not having circulated such a memo toall networked employees is becoming to be considered an example of grossneglect on the part of network management.andM;The FutureandM;The current network security situation is rather primitive.andP;  The vendors havebeen concentrating on engineering reliable systems with constantly improvinghuman factors.andP;  This was absolutely necessary.andP;  They have been so successful,and so many people are now network literate compared to only a few years agothat most networks now represent significant security risks.andP;  This situationstarted to become clear one or two years ago, and various vendors havequickly responded with products which are much more security aware.andM;At the moment, most of the protective measures can be quickly broken by adetermined,  financed  and technologically aware opponent.andP;  The detectionmeasures are moving away from voluminous traces which may not contribute toproblem isolation because of too much data.andP;  Really good, semi-intelligenttracking will be arriving soon as the audit trail developers gain moreexperience about how to define the exceptions.andM;in the area of protection, we should look for the following by the summer of1990:andM;* Encryption for local and remote links, hopefully in silicon where itbelongs.andP;  DES and CCEP are okay, most others are inferior to these.andM;* Improved password techniques and extension to more components.andM;* Network monitors which will alert the supervisor to any networkconfiguration change and request human authorization.andP;  Upon not getting aproper okay, they will suspend network activity.andM;* In the area of detection, we should look for the following by the summer of1990:andM;*  Better audit trail data reduction and reporting programs.andM;* More components which will have fault tolerant (if something goes wrongthey recover and continue) or high security modes (if something goes wrongthey shut down).andM;Overall, the last year has shown very healthy progress.andP;  Previously muchnetwork development concentrated on proving that networks were reliable andcapable of contributing to corporate computing.andP;  This has been accomplishedby efficient and reliable hardware and advanced software approaches to humanand technical problems.andP;  Now it is only the rare MIS manager who is soossified as to disparage LANs.andM;Much activity now focuses on showing that the contributions to computing andcommunications can be made with the same security and safety as a multi-usercomputer.andP;  To be frank, we aren't there quite yet.andP;  However with the productsavailable today the diligent network administrator can make a LAN secureenough for almost all applications - and LANs still have the outstanding costeffectiveness, modularity and upgradability which makes them the superiorchoice for most applications.andM;Thanks to Rick Carlson at Centel Business Systems.andM;James B. Nickson is president of On Disk Software, a developer of utilitiesbased in New York, N.Y..andM;We clamored for software that was easy to use.andP;  We harped until hardware waseasy to install.andP;  LAN products now install themselves, require littleconfiguring, recover from errors and duplicate data.andP;  But every silver lininghas a cloud.andP;  Such ease of use invites security breaches.andP;  And with so manynetwork-literate people, most networks represent significant security risks.andO;It the data on the LAN is even of minor importance to your company'ssurvival, then take security seriously.andP;  Security is not just for theparanoid.andM;MANUFACTURERS OF SECURE LAN PRODUCTSandM;CommunicationsandM;Crystal PointandM;12707 120th Avenue NEandM;Kirkland, WA, 98034andM;206-821D19O9andM;Product.andP;  LineLockandM;ServersandM;ApricotandM;111 Granton Drive, Suite 401andM;Richmond Hill, Ontario L4B IL5andM;416-492-2777andM;Product.andP;  VX FT 486 ServerandM;DCAandM;1000 Alderman DriveandM;Alpharetta, GA 30201andM;404-442-4545andM;Product.andP;  10Net (encrypted networkandM;OS)andM;WorkstationsandM;ApricotandM;Product.andP;  QI WorkstationsandM;Workstation AftermarketandM;Command Software SystemsandM;28990 Pacific Coast Highway,andM;Suite 208andM;Malibu, CA 90265andM;800-423-9147andM;Product.andP;  Freeze!andP;  Workstation locker)andM;Gateway TechnologiesandM;180 West Church RoadandM;King of Prussia, PA 19406andM;215-354-0330andM;Product.andP;  Privacy (Logon protection)andM;Saber SoftwareandM;PO Box 9088andM;Dallas, TX 75209andM;800-338-8754andM;Product.andP;  Secure (Smart workstationandM;locker)andM;Biometric DevicesandM;Autoslg SystemsandM;PO Box 165050andM;irving, TX 75016andM;214-258-8033andM;Product.andP;  Signature verificationandM;Ecco industriesandM;130 Centre StreetandM;Danvers, MA 01923andM;508-777-7750andM;Product.andP;  VoiceKeyandM;EyeDentifyandM;PO Box 3827andM;Portland, OR 97208andM;503-645-6666andM;Product.andP;  EyeNetandM;FingerMatrixandM;30 Virginia RoadandM;North White Plains, NY 10603andM;914-428-5441andM;Product.- Ridge Reader MintandM;Recognition SystemsandM;1589 Provincetown DriveandM;San Jose, CA 95129andM;408-257-2477andM;Product.andP;  ID3D-XU identifier (HandandM;geometry)andM;ThumbScanandM;1250 Oakmead Parkway, Suite 210andM;Sunnyvale, CA 94088andM;408-737-9003andM;Product., ThumbScanandM;Encryption SystemsandM;Command Software SystemsandM;Product.andP;  LangardandM;LatticeandM;2500 S.
