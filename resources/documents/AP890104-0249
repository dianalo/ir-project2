William Seidman: Protector Of Federal Banking Funds</HEAD><HEAD>Laserphoto</HEAD><BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   L. William Seidman is a lot like a protectiveparent when it comes to the nation's banking funds.   Nothing gets his guard up more than talk of a proposed matchupbetween his ``baby,'' the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichinsures commercial bank deposits, and the wayward thrift insurer,the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.   ``People keep telling us they have to get married, and we'relooking at the bride very carefully,'' said Seidman, FDIC chairmanfor the past three years and one of the most forceful regulators inWashington.   As he tries to help set the banking agenda for the Bushadministration, Seidman (pronounced Seed-Mun) is blunt about hisfeelings on the thrift crisis and opposition to an FDIC-FSLICmerger, which some propose as a step toward solving FSLIC's moneyproblems. Banks, though, worry such a merger will result inskyrocketing insurance premiums.   ``There was a time when you could have merged the two. (But) amerger now will bankrupt the funds,'' Seidman said in an interview.   Unlike the FDIC, FSLIC is technically insolvent due to the largenumber of problem-thrift bailouts. Last year alone, FSLIC spent$38.6 billion to help merge or sell 222 insolvent Sandamp;Ls. Hundredsmore remain financially shaky.   Seidman proposes, among other things, that the government bitethe bullet by spending another $30 billion in 1989 to close 100 ofthe sickest thrifts. The other problem Sandamp;Ls could be dealt with overa longer period of time.   He also wants the government to consider revamping the entiredeposit insurance system to include new broad powers for his agencyand splitting FSLIC from its parent, the Federal Home Loan BankBoard.   ``If I were advising the president I think he should do it(resolve the thrift crisis) early on in the honeymoon days ... whenit's someone else's problem,'' he said. ``If he waits too long, itbecomes his problem. It's not a politically attractive issue.''   Seidman's zeal is understandable. He had his own problems aftertaking the helm of the FDIC in October 1985, becoming its 14thchairman.   For one thing, he inherited the fallout from Continental IllinoisCorp.'s near demise a year before. During his tenure, Seidman hascontended with more than 600 bank failures, including apost-Depression record 221 in 1988.   The FDIC posted its first operating loss last year, although itremains firmly solvent, with a net worth of around $15 billion atthe end of 1988.   Seidman, 67, came to the job with surprising little bankingexperience.   At the time of his appointment, he was dean of the College ofBusiness at Arizona State University. Before that, he served as vicechairman at copper giant Phelps Dodge Corp. and a managing parter inthe accounting firm Seidman andamp; Seidman, started by his father anduncle.   His business acumen and investment savvy also have helped makehim a millionaire many times over, and he has several homes aroundthe country, including one in Hawaii. He shares some of his businesssmarts in a just-published book he co-authored, ``Competitiveness:the Executive's Guide to Success.''   Seidman also is no stranger to Republican politics. From 1974 to1977 he served as assistant for economic affairs under PresidentFord, a childhood friend from his hometown Grand Rapids, Mich. From1983 to 1984 he was co-chairman of the White House Conference onProductivity.   He also ran an unsuccessful campaign to become Michigan auditorgeneral in the 1960s.   All that experience ``and my good looks,'' Seidman said, hashelped in tackling the banking world. There have been some bigissues to tackle, including: the Latin debt problem, the campaign toexpand into investment banking, and lately, the debt-financedtakeover craze, which Seidman warns could endanger big lending banks.   ``My experience says that credibility is the No. 1 asset you haveto have,'' Seidman said, ``and telling it like it is is the best wayto deal with things.''   A free-market advocate, Seidman has been called a team player bythose who know him well. But he's also not afraid to speak his mind.   For instance, at the American Bankers Association annualconvention in Honolulu last fall, a red-faced Seidman denounced thecomptroller of the currency, Robert L. Clarke, who is on the boardof the FDIC, for suggesting that commercial banks prepare for apossible FDIC-FSLIC merger. Just the day before the two men held afriendly, informal news conference.   ``He (Seidman) feels very strongly that the resolution (of thethrift crisis) should not come on the backs of commercial banks,''said James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with the investmentfirm Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods.   ``He has been a good steward for the industry at a time when theeffects of deregulation (of the 1970s) have caused signficantturmoil as shown by the bank failures over the years.   ``He has been a breath of fresh air.''   Short, stout and nearly bald, Seidman bares a slight resemblanceto the late actor William Frawley, known as Fred Mertz on the ``ILove Lucy'' television series. He has the same gravelly voice.   But he's far more physically active than the Mertz character was,enjoying polo and a variety of other sports _ and not as grouchy,especially to his six children and several grandchildren.   ``He knows how to relax. It's a wonderful gift,'' said his wife,Sally. ``He could have a horrendous day and then he just forgetsabout it when he gets home.''   While at work, Seidman also tries to keep things informal,remaining accessible to banking analysts and the press. If it wereup to him, he'd probably be wearing sweat shirts and casual slacksto work.   Before attending a recent ABA dinner in Honolulu, ``He asked me,`Do you think I have to wear a suit and tie?','' Mrs. Seidmanconfided. ``And I said, `Yeah, you better.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for Friday Jan. 6.</NOTE></DOC>
