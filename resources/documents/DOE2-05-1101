The patients ranged in age from 43 to 83 years old(average : 65 years old). There were 41 males and 9 females. The affectedside was the right in 22 cases and the left in 28 cases. Retrograde pyelography(RP) was found to be the most useful modality, followed by computed tomography(CT), ultrasonic tomography (US) and arteriography (AG), in those patientswith renal pelvic tumors. RP and CT were also effective diagnostic imagingsin those patients with ureteral tumors. Excretory urography (IVP) showedabnormal findings : non-visualized kidney, hydronephrosis, filling defectsetc. in all cases. So, IVP was thought to be an effective screening methodin the diagnosis of renal pelvic and ureteral tumors. There was no statisticalcorrelation between IVP findings and stage in renal pelvic tumors. Asfor staging diagnosis, CT and AG were effective in those patients withrenal pelvic tumors. Correct diagnosis was usually made by only two imagingmodalities (IVP and RP). But CT and US were helpful for making a finaldiagnosis when RP could not be performed, and CT or AG was helpful inthe staging diagnosis. Cytological study is necessary and should be addedto imaging modalities to make a correct diagnosis, because its positiverates in the diagnosis of urothelial tumors are high.</TEXT></DOC>
