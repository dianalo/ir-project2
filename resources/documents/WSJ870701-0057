The agreement, subject to a final vote in the House-Senate conference working a broad banking bill, accedes to the Senate's level of aid for the FSLIC; the House previously had voted for only a $5 billion line of credit over two years.    The Reagan administration had sought borrowing of $15 billion over five years.    House members decided to accept the Senate level in order to help shore up depositors' confidence. Some people have been withdrawing deposits in the wake of publicity surrounding the thrift industry's problems.    The Senate may make attempts to raise the borrowing limit further in conference.    Separately, the conference committee rejected attempts to significantly modify a curb on limited-service banks, and a temporary ban on new powers for banks to expand their activities. Approval of these provisions is a major victory for Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.). The measures were part of Sen. Proxmire's bill that passed the Senate in March, and have yet to be considered by the full House.    The legislation would prohibit federal regulators from giving banks new authorities to engage in securities, insurance and real estate activities retroactively from March 6, 1987, to March 1, 1988.    The measure would also prohibit the establishment of limited-service banks retroactively from March 5, 1987.    The institutions established before that date would be barred from expanding their services and from increasing their assets by more than 7% each year, beginning 12 months after the bill becomes law.    Limited-service banks either take deposits or make commercial loans, but don't do both, skirting the legal definition of a bank. Thus, they are exempt from many of the restrictions placed on full-service banks.    The conferees have yet to resolve the issue of directing federal regulators to ease their treatment of thrifts in economically pressed regions. </TEXT></DOC>
