The agreement includes three A-320 twin-engine jets and three A-330 jets for delivery in the early 1990s, according to Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, which leases and sells aircraft. The agreement is contingent upon a decision by the Airbus board, which is scheduled to meet today, to develop the two planes. </TEXT></DOC>
