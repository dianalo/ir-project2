In the absence of other candidates with widespread support inthe Liberal Democratic Party, persuading former Foreign MinisterMasayoshi Ito appears to be the ``only solution for the timebeing,'' party sources said on condition of anonymity.   He is among a few senior party officials not connected to theRecruit scandal.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and most other party leadershave been linked to the influence-peddling affair, either throughpolitical donations from Recruit Co. or profits made by aides onbargain-priced stock shares offered by Recruit. Takeshita announcedApril 25 he will step down to take responsibility.   Although the party has not concluded its selection processformally, Ito is seen as the man officials hope will win backpublic trust before summer elections for half the seats inParliament's upper house.   Ito refused to confirm his demands.   ``I have said this many times _ I have no intention to becomethe prime minister,'' he told reporters Tuesday.   Ito has cited his age, 75, and health impaired by diabetes asreasons for refusing.   News reports, however, said he is holding out for reforms.   The mass-circulation newspaper Asahi Shimbun said partysecretary-general Shintaro Abe rejected Ito's reform proposals as``impractical,'' but it said Ito refused to discuss the leadershipunless he is assured some proposals will be implemented.   Party sources said Ito has demanded the resignations of allpoliticians implicated in the Recruit scandal and other corruptioncases, and an end to factions within the party.   The relative strengths and desires of about half a dozenfactions have to be considered each time a Cabinet is formed.   Ito also told a meeting of senior party officials Tuesday thatthe party lacks a ``real sense of crisis,'' and he is not confidenthe can conduct reforms under such circumstances, Kyodo News Serviceand the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.   ``Changing only on the surface won't do any good,'' Ito toldreporters Tuesday. ``Revolutionary changes in the party's way ofthinking are urgently needed.''   Party officials said they have agreed to settle on a new leaderby the weekend. The party leader would become prime ministerbecause of the Liberal Democrats' large majority in Parliament.   Meanwhile, Takeshita told former Cabinet Secretary MasaharuGotoda to draft a political reform package to present to thecurrent session of parliament, news reports said.   They quoted Takeshita as telling Gotoda, ``Public distrusttoward politics caused by the Recruit scandal is quite serious, andI'd like the (party) to draft a political reform plan as soon aspossible.''   It will include new restrictions on political fund raising andan asset disclosure law, they said.   In the scandal, the information and publishing conglomerateRecruit Co. made large donations to Takeshita and other leadingpoliticians, chiefly from the governing party, and soldbargain-priced stock shares to about 160 politicians, businessmenand others.   Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested onbribery and other charges, and three Cabinet ministers haveresigned.</TEXT></DOC>
