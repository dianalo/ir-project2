Ray MacSharry, agriculture chief for the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community, urged the United States to recognize in tradenegotiations the measures adopted by the trading bloc to curbproduction and farm subsidies.   ``Reductions were not achieved without considerable effort on ourpart and sacrifice by the farming community...'' he said in a speechto the International Chamber of Commerce in Brussels. ``Othersshould follow our lead instead of stepping in to profit from ourefforts.''   He also said, ``We should ensure that the sacrifices of onenegotiating party are not stripped of their value by the opportunismof another.''   MacSharry appeared to be trying to put the United States on thedefensive in a dispute between the two sides over an American demandfor sharp cuts in European farm subsidies. The fight has stalled thelatest round of international trade negotiations.   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills met over the weekend with MacSharry andFrans Andriessen, the EEC's top trade official, to try to resolvethe issue.   The international trade talks, sponsored by the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade, resume April 5 in Geneva.   MacSharry said he told Yeutter and Mrs. Hills: ``We must getcredit for our reductions in support.''   Last year European leaders limited the maxium annual amount spenton price guarantees over five years. U.S. officials contend themeasures were not enough to fix a fundamentally flawed system andwant more long-term changes.   MacSharry reiterated the EEC's position that it ``cannotsubscribe to revolutionary changes of its policy.''   ``We...are asked not only to freeze but also to reduceagricultural support,'' he said. ``My reaction to this is that thereductions we have achieved already in some of our suprlus productshave been, to put it mildly, impressive.''   He said quotas imposed in 1984 have cut milk production by 11million metric tons and meant the reduction of 3.6 million head ofdairy cattle in 1986-88.   As a result, he said the EEC has contributed to stabilizing asector marked by overproduction and low world prices.   ``It is, therefore, to say the least, unfortunate that, in 1988,increased production in the United States, Canada and Australiaalone has offset reductions achieved in the community,'' he said.   The EEC provides costly subsidies to farmers through guaranteedprices for many crops. It also gives exporters help so moreexpensive European farm prdoucts can compete with lower prices onthe world market.   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped thecommunity increase its share of the world market. It has fought backwith its own Export Enhancement Program.</TEXT></DOC>
