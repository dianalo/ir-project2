The introductorychapter presents a generic scheme for determining the cause of healthcomplaints and includes an example of a health questionnaire. Each followingchapter is designed primarily to assist persons investigating healthcomplaints in non-industrial working environments with selecting appropriatesampling and analytical techniques and applying them to the problemsat hand. A characterization is made of each of the pollutant categoriesand the hazards they pose. Consideration is also given to nonindustrialstandards, and guidelines, and to action levels for making more detailedmeasurements. The manual will be published and sold by AIHA.</TEXT></DOC>
