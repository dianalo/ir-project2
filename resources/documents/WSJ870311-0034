The European consortium called the St. Louis-based aircraft maker's assertions &quot;without grounds and thus totally erroneous.&quot; Airbus said there haven't been any further cooperation talks, either formal or informal, between itself and McDonnell Douglas since negotiations on the issue broke off in September.    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman yesterday said that while there have been no meetings this year between his company and the &quot;top management of the Airbus Industrie organization itself, we have held discussions both with individual Airbus partner companies and their governments relating to possible cooperation.&quot; He added that &quot;this dialogue has been going on for some time.&quot;    Airbus is made up of France's state-owned Aerospatiale, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Spain's Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. Customarily, governments in these countries provide as much as 90% of the funding for new Airbus projects.    Talks last year between Airbus and McDonnell Douglas centered on possible cooperation on a long-range jet to compete with Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s 747. But negotiations broke down when neither side was willing to give up its own projects -- Airbus its A-340 and McDonnell Douglas its MD-11. McDonnell said this week that the latest informal talks have focused on finding projects where the two companies' interests wouldn't conflict. </TEXT></DOC>
