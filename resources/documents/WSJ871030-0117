As previously reported, NL has proposed redeeming the preferred shares for about $930 million, or an estimated $15.50 for each of the 60 million shares outstanding. The transaction was contingent on the oil-field services and chemicals concern's lining up about $1.2 billion in financing, including about $140 million that would have been used to retire NL bank debt due Dec. 31.    The company, which is controlled by Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, blamed uncertainty in financial markets as the reason why it hasn't been able to arrange financing.    NL said it will use $115 million from the recently proposed or completed sales of four operating units to repay its $141 million revolving-credit lines. The company also said it will use cash generated from the sale of excess manufacturing capacity and limited-partnership interests to repay the debt.    NL said it will continue to seek financing to redeem the preferred shares, which were issued in 1986 as part of an effort to block Mr. Simmons from taking control of the company. At the time, NL proposed spinning off its chemical unit to shareholders, and the preferred shares were to be exchanged for stock in the new chemical company. Since Mr. Simmons acquired a majority of NL's common stock in August 1986, he has tried three different times to eliminate the preferred shares.    Taking advantage of lower stock market prices, Mr. Simmons recently increased his holdings of NL's preferred stock to about 20 million shares, or one-third of the shares outstanding. He previously owned 20% of the preferred shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
