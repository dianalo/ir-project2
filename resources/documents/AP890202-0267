John A. Paddock said he originally offered to lend hisconstruction company's plane and pilot to Peter MacDonald, chairmanof the nation's largest Indian tribe, when MacDonald was seekingre-election to his post in 1986.   He said MacDonald used the plane for about 35 trips, includingmany after his November 1986 election victory, including two flightsto Las Vegas.   Paddock's construction company had been declared ineligible forjobs reserved for Indians on the reservation by Peterson Zah, whohad ousted MacDonald as chairman in 1982.   Paddock said by supplying MacDonald with the plane he hoped``that we'd be able to bid on contracts.''   He told a special panel of the Senate Select Committee on IndianAffairs that has been investigating corruption in programs designedfor Indians that the flights cost him $12,000 in expenses for pilotsand fuel. The trips would have been worth about $60,000commercially, he said.   Paddock also told the committee that in December 1987, MacDonaldasked him for a $35,000 loan. He said he couldn't refuse the requestsince as a contractor doing work on the reservation the tribe hadhis financial statements and ``I would have had a hard time tellinghim I was broke.''   He said the loan, which was to be for one year, was never repaid.   Paddock testified that he paid for many of the expenses for thetrips to Las Vegas that he made with MacDonald, their wives andothers.   He said he also lent a company car to MacDonald's daughter, Hope,and paid a $400 bill he received for use of the vehicle's telephone.   He said he also paid $2,500 for a birthday party for MacDonald'swife, Wanda, and was later reimbursed for half of the expenses ofthe party.   MacDonald has denied he has acted improperly as leader of theNavajo nation.   Paddock testified that he set up a company called Native AmericanConstruction and Engineering, headed by a friend, Donald James, whowas a full-blooded Navajo, ``to allow us to bid on the preferencework for Indians.''   On Wednesday, a former Navy official convicted in the Wedtechscandal told the Senate investigative panel that a Michigan companyreceived multimillion-dollar government contracts on the strength ofa shaky claim to native American ownership.   Richard Ramirez, former head of the Navy's Small andDisadvantaged Business Utilization Program, said he counseledcompanies seeking contracts under the Small BusinessAdministration's minority set-aside program.   Ramirez said Kinross Manufacturing Co. of Michigan was an Indianfront company controlled by wealthy businessmen, including some withconnections to Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor whosetop officials pleaded guilty to bribing government officials to getcontracts.   Ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connectionwith the Wedtech affair and is cooperating with the government incases related to SBA contractors.   The Senate panel went into closed session Wednesday to hearRamirez' testimony, which was then summarized in a statementreleased by the committee staff.   The statement did not identify the businessmen Ramirez said hadconnections with both Wedtech and Kinross, and committee staff wouldnot elaborate.   Ramirez said Kinross installed a man named Gerry Blanchard ashead of the company to win admittance to the minority program,claiming he was an Indian even though he was not enrolled in anyIndian tribe until 1982.   Kinross received minority certification and then wonmultimillion-dollar ammunition contracts, Ramirez said.   Ramirez said he had never seen a start-up company supported by somany government loans. He claimed that Kinross used influentialpolitical ties to gain SBA approval.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special panel,said this week's hearings into Indian set-asides have found problemscommon to the entire SBA minority preference program.   ``The committee has discovered certain patterns of abuses commonto Kinross, Wedtech and other (minority qualifying) companies,'' hesaid.   Earlier in the day, Kraig Kendall, president of Kandamp;T Homes, Inc.,in Shawnee, Okla. told the panel that the government's policy ofrequiring companies to have 51 percent Indian ownership to winIndian-related contracts is ``an invitation for fraud and fronts.''   Kendall, who served a prison term after pleading guilty in 1985to charges related to bribing a Chickasaw tribe governor, saidcontracting now ``is in a shambles.''   He said that to participate in bidding for Indian-relatedgovernment contracts, he made an employee's wife who had an Indianrelative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company.   He also said his practice of giving Indian officials giftsranging from dinner hams to automobiles was standard procedure amongthose seeking construction contracts on lands of the AbsenteeShawnee and Chickasaw tribes.   He said he was unable to obtain contracts legitimately and soonresorted to gifts, gratuities and ``in some cases some seriousbribes.''   The committee began its hearings into corruption in Indianaffairs Monday and has been concentrating on the ``front''operations.   Donald Asbra, chief of the contracting division of the Bureau ofIndian Affairs, testified that the agency does not checkcontractors' declarations that they are majority Indian-owned.   He said it is up to Indians to police themselves and that theycan complain to the BIA if they believe business that is supposed togo to native Americans is going to non-Indians.   ``We don't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said Asbra.</TEXT></DOC>
