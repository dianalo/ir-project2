Amoco, a Chicago-based oil producer, will acquire 9% of Shell's and Exxon's joint 94.8% holding in the Fulmar oil field in the central North Sea, bringing its stake in the field to 12.7%.    Shell and Exxon, in turn, will acquire Amoco's 25.77% equity interest in Block 210/24A in the northern North Sea and Block 21/20A in the central sector. The swap is retroactive to July 1.    Six wells have been drilled by an Amoco-led consortium on block 210/24A. Four appraisal wells have been drilled, three by the Amoco group and one by British Petroleum PLC.    In Block 21/20A, two wells have been drilled by the Amoco group showing that the area contains oil. So far, insufficient reserves have been discovered to justify development, but the block has exploration potential, Shell said. </TEXT></DOC>
