He said he felt no bitterness toward George Bush and was ready toput the campaign behind him and complete the final two years of histerm as governor. Dukakis gave no indication whether he will run fora fourth term in 1990 or seek the presidency again in four years.   ``At this point my job is clear: I'm going to be the very bestgovernor of this commonwealth that I can be,'' Dukakis toldreporters. ``There's a lot to do. There are many challenges outthere ahead. What happens in the future remains to be seen.''   Among those challenges will be re-establishing relations with hisstate Legislature amid growing rumbling about the Dukakisadministration's handling of a revenue shortfall that has forcedMassachusetts to borrow to pay its bills.   Although it is dominated by Democrats, the Legislature hasscheduled hearings next week to look into state finances, andDukakis could come under fire from lawmakers unhappy that thegovernor was out of state for much of the past year as the problemunfolded.   At the same time Dukakis said he expected to remain a player innational Democratic Party politics _ including having a say in theselection of a new party chairman.   Dukakis wasted no time getting back to work, arriving at theoffice at 9:30 a.m. to applause from about 50 state workers. Laterin the day he met with reporters to reflect on the campaign, whichhe said left President-elect Bush without a mandate and theDemocratic Party with lasting grass-roots and fund-raisingorganizations despite his loss.   ``I'm not a bitter person,'' a weary Dukakis said. ``I lookforward. I'm fundamentally an optimist and somebody who believesdeeply in this country and its people.   ``Am I disappointed, sure I am,'' he said, laying at least partof the blame for his loss on the tone of the Bush campaign.   ``It was a distorted campaign,'' the Massachusetts governor said.``It was a campaign that distorted my record and I think did not sethigh standards for the kind of campaign we want for the presidencyand it may well set a standard we live to regret.''   National Democratic leaders were unhappy with the insularmanagement of the Dukakis effort, yet Dukakis trumpeted himself assomeone who would keep a high profile within his party.   ``I'll be in the thick of the fight to make sure that we respondto the real concerns of the people of this coutnry,'' Dukakis said.``I personally will continue to do whatever I can, with my fellowgovernors, the Congress, with the new administration, here inMassachusetts, to make sure that we respond and that we respondstrongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which facethe American people every day.''   Dukakis also had a bit of advice for future candidates.   ``I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have torespond and you have to respond quickly,'' said Dukakis, who largelyignored unrelenting GOP attacks _ and advisers urging him to respond_ until late in the campaign.   But he had no substantive answer to the Democratic Party'sdilemma; while it has great success in local, state andcongressional races it has had only one successful presidentialcandidate in the last 20 years.   Dukakis also offered a few jokes before saying good-bye to thelarge national press corps that traveled with him.   ``I believe in the redemption of souls,'' he deadpanned whenasked about the appointment of James A. Baker III, who managed theBush campaign Dukakis so frequently criticized, as secretary ofstate.   He drew laughter again when asked why he didn't campaignthroughout the race as furiously as he did in the final three days,when he stumped virtually non-stop without sleep.   ``If I had more time, you'd all be in the hospital,'' he saidwith a grin. ``I wouldn't have done that to you guys, I think toomuch of you.''</TEXT></DOC>
