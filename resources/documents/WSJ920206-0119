They might not feel the same way if theiremployers substituted their monthly pay checks for lump sumsof unknown amounts at some uncertain future dates.   Back in 1973, I too made a similar argument. I argued thatit would be acceptable to tax capital gains and other incomeat a flat 25% rate -- but only if capital losses could befully offset against any sort of income and capital gainswere adjusted for past as well as future inflation. Thisproposal was youthful innocence. Congress will never define&quot;fairness&quot; in a way that leaves more revenue in the hands ofthose who earned it.</LP><TEXT>   Under the current tax system, a stockholder who receives acapital gain from reinvested profits is subject to a tripletax. Let's say an individual buys some stock. That investorhas paid taxes on his salary before using whatever was leftto purchase the stock. That's one tax. Then there are thecorporate taxes. The corporation in which he has invested haspaid taxes on profits before using whatever is left to paydividends or to reinvest in expanding or modernizing thebusiness. Any increased profits arising from that expansionor modernization will face a tax rate of about 48%, aftersubtracting the 34% corporate tax and applying a 28%capital-gains tax to the balance. But that is not the end ofit. Since added business capital will also produce addeddividends, those dividends will face another 31% tax.   By contrast, when a homeowner invests money improving hishouse, those costs are properly excluded from any capitalgain when the house is sold. Not so when a company makessimilar improvements, enhancing the firm's value. The stockrises because the improved plant and equipment is expected toincrease future dividends. Yet investors understand thatthose increased future dividends will be taxed again whenpaid out. This keeps the before-tax capital gain (the stockprice) lower than otherwise.   Since 1986, corporations have been able to avoid theselayers of tax by substituting debt for equity, and thendeducting their interest expenses from taxable profits. Arecent study for the National Bureau of Economic Research byJames Poterba observed that between 1986 and 1990nonfinancial corporations retired $476 billion of equitiesthrough leveraged buyouts and stock repurchases, and replacedit with $758 billion of debt.   Why? Companies were responding to market signals, whichindicated that those willing to take risks would rather do sowith income today (risky debt) than face an additional tax onpossible future capital gains tomorrow (risky stocks). Sincecommercial paper and junk bonds were held for income, ratherthan capital gains, individuals who switched from stocks tocorporate IOUs avoided tax. Who was left to hold the stock?Foreigners from countries with little or no capital-gainstax.   At the federal level, corporate taxes by 1990 were a thirdlower than the Congressional Budget Office had forecast onlythree years earlier, adding $42 billion to the budgetdeficit. The reason for the drop in corporate tax collectionshad been predicted by Randall Pozdena in a 1987 study for theSan Francisco Fed: &quot;An increase . . . in the tax on capitalgains increases the use of debt generally and low-grade(risky or `junk') debt specifically.&quot; This do-it-yourself taxreform, though, left leveraged companies with high fixed debtpayments, and therefore more vulnerable to recession. Unableto cut dividends, companies have cut employment instead.   The president's proposal to drop the capital-gains taxwould do some repair. Savers would immediately experience awealth gain amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars,since they would not have to put away 28% of their lifesavings for taxes. Investment and economic growth wouldincrease since there would be less disincentive to movecapital; debt strains would diminish as companies issuedequity to retire debt; and new firms, which have beenregulated out of access to bank credit or commercial paper,would find it easier to sell new stock issues.   There is, however, an unnecessary flaw in the proposal: Itstretches the holding period to qualify for the lowest taxrate to two years in 1993, three in 1994. Gains on assetsheld less than two years would thus face a higher tax rate in1993 (19.6%) than in 1992 (15.4%), and a still higher rate in1994. Such an increasing tax rate on medium-term gains wouldboost asset sales and tax receipts in the first few years,but have the opposite effect in later years, as investorsbecame locked-in again for a three-year rate.   Indeed, the frequent assertion that a lower capital-gainstax loses revenue &quot;in the long run&quot; is not due to the lowerrate, but rather to the three-year holding period, which theTreasury itself estimated would cut revenues by about $7billion annually in later years. Most revenue gains from thelower rate would continue indefinitely, from sources -- suchas higher asset prices and faster economic growth -- notincluded in any revenue estimates.   There is no reason whatsoever to induce people to hold anasset one moment longer than they think appropriate. Forcinginvestors to wait three years for the 15% tax would greatlyimpair the mobility of capital, bribing people to hold ontoshares in yesterday's winners. Far from supporting &quot;patientcapital&quot; in new high-tech enterprises, the only stocks thatrational investors would plan on holding for three years arethose of soap companies, soft drink makers and utilities.   Professional critics reply that gains from thecapital-gains tax itself would be at the expense of otherincome taxes, as taxpayers &quot;convert ordinary income&quot; intocapital gains. Former Congressional Budget Office economistEric Toder thus worried that &quot;total income tax revenues maystill decline if taxable investors substitute tax-preferredcapital-gains assets for assets yielding fully taxableincome.&quot;   What would actually happen is quite different. Taxableinvestors would substitute more shares of stock at higherprices -- all of which are eventually subject to taxes onboth capital gains and dividends -- for assets that are onlysubject to tax on current income (junk bonds and money marketfunds), or to no taxes at all (venture funds held bytax-exempt institutions, or tax-exempt notes), or consumerassets which easily evade capital gains (antiques, orientalrugs, stamps and coins). And since corporations would clearlyuse more equity and less debt, corporate tax receipts wouldunquestionably rise by tens of billions at both the federaland state level.   Many retired people with substantial assets to sell havemodest incomes, while many young professionals with highsalaries have not yet accumulated assets subject to this tax.It is a mystery why Congress would wish to punish either theeducation and effort required to earn a high salary, or thosewho forego current income for a stake in new products, newenterprises, new management and new ideas.   Those with large capital gains in any year must, bydefinition, have a high &quot;income&quot; in that year, if the capitalgain is included with income. If such one-time gains are notcounted as though they were regular income, though, it turnsout that about 26% of the gains in 1985 went to those earningunder $20,000 in 1985, while another 26% went to thoseearning over $200,000. More than 10 million taxpayers reportsome capital gain in any given year. Some 68% of those gainsare from taxpayers earning less than $50,000, and these gainstypically average at least 10% to 20% of income.   Affluent individuals do not have to pay capital-gainstaxes. They can simply avoid selling any assets they own, andthereafter put any new savings into assets that mainly payoff in current interest income, or in assets with consumptionvalue on which capital-gains tax is rarely paid (such as art,antique cars or lavish homes). The only people who are forcedto pay capital-gains tax are families that must tap theirsavings, or sell a farm or small business, in order tofinance retirement, medical emergencies or college.   Any tax change that improves the profitability ofincreasing production, investment and employment is going tobenefit those who invest in making those things happen. It isnot possible to increase the nation's wealth without somebodybecoming more wealthy. But what makes a lower capital-gainstax so marvelous is that it has an immediate and lastingbenefit to the economy, greatly reduces the budget deficitforever and doesn't hurt a soul.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic research at theHudson Institute in Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
