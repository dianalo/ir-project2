On board wereWilliam Diller, 33, the captain, of Atascadero and Don Davis, 49, the crewmember.;    As their boat went down, Tierney said, the men had time only tograb the radio and call, &quot;Mayday! Mayday!&quot;;    With that scant information,two Coast Guard helicopters set out -- one from Los Angeles and one from SanFrancisco, determined to comb the coastal waters until they met.;    Then,Coast Guard radio operators in Long Beach got word from one of the &quot;earthstations&quot; that monitor satellite signals around the globe -- Tierney did notknow the station's location -- pinpointing a distress radio beaconbroadcasting from the waters off Port San Luis, south of Morro Bay.;    TheCoast Guard-required broadcasting device is called an EPIRB -- or emergencyposition indicating radio beacon, according to Tierney.;    &quot;If it sinks, itfloats free and the antenna swings around and pops up,&quot; he said. &quot;There issome kind of switch so that when it turns over, it starts emitting a signal.;   &quot;That was really the key to their being found,&quot; Tierney said, &quot;because wereally didn't know where we were looking.&quot;;    The fishermen were picked up ina life raft at sunset, just two hours after their vessel had sunk.;    Bothwater and air temperature were in the mid-60s, Tierney said.;    The two weretaken to Vandenberg Air Force Base near Santa Maria, where they were treatedfor mild hypothermia and released.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARILYN LEWIS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910311  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  334  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 11, 199100071195,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
