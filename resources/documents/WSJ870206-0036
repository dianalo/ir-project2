As NASA's associate administrator for space flight, Mr. Moore gave the final go-ahead for the launch of the Challenger Jan. 28, 1986, which exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all seven crew members. Most of the other officials involved in the launch decision also have left NASA or have been reassigned.    A few months after the accident, Mr. Moore became head of Johnson Space Center in Houston -- a post he left last October to become special assistant to NASA's general manager here. He subsequently went on leave.    Mr. Moore will become director of program development for Ball Aerospace Systems in Boulder, Colo.    In testimony before the presidential commission investigating the accident, Mr. Moore said he hadn't been kept informed of the recurring problems with the shuttle's booster rockets. A leak in a booster-rocket joint caused the accident. He also said he wasn't told that engineers for Morton Thiokol Inc., maker of the booster rockets, urged a delay in the launch until the weather warmed up. </TEXT></DOC>
