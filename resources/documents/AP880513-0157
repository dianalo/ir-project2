In a 136-2 vote, Israel and the United States were the onlycountries to oppose the resolution calling on the United States toallow the Palestine Liberation Organization Mission to operateunder an international treaty.   It was the third time since March the General Assembly had sentthe United States such a message.   The United States is seeking a federal court order to close thePLO Mission. The United Nations considers the mission the solelegal representative of the Palestinian people at the 159-memberworld body.   The PLO is invited to speak on all Middle East issues, but itcannot vote.   The resolution calls on the United States to honor the U.S.-U.N.Headquarters Treaty of 1947 requiring it to allow all U.N.missions, including the PLO representative, to operate anddischarge official functions.   But a U.S. anti-terrorism law passed by the Congress in 1987requires closure of the PLO Mission and is in conflict with thetreaty.   The International Court of Justice in the Hague last monthdecreed that the United States is obligated to take the PLO disputeto court. The United States has defied the court order.   PLO Ambassador Zehdi Labib Terzi told the assembly thatinternational law must take precedence over domestic legislation.   ``Can the U.N. Headquarters in the U.S.A. still be able todischarge its responsibilities fully and effectively if its hostcountry is violating the headquarters treaty?'' Terzi asked. ``Willmissions accredited to the U.N. be able to functionindependently?'' he asked.</TEXT></DOC>
