But one manufacturer has been making hayfor a long time with that little tag on its products. Thiscompany's stock, already a winner, has further room to grow,analysts think.   It's Russell Corp., a maker of such athletic wear as sweatshirts and running shorts. The stock soared 57% last year,helped by a management that stayed focused on the long termas it steered the company through recession.</LP><TEXT>   Instead of following corporate fashion and slashingemployees to cut near-term costs, the Alabama concern keptthe work force intact, and continues to reap productivitygains. The result, bulls say, has been a stock-priceperformance that should inspire other manufacturers, be theycar makers or computer companies, to look and learn.   Josie Esquivel, a Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst, saysRussell's stock could climb an additional 20% this year, onthe heels of this month's 6% rise to 37 3/4. Ms. Esquivelfigures Russell's earnings can grow at an average annual rateof 18% for the next three years. Propelling profit will besuch new products as NuBlend -- a fabric technology thatbanishes the small fuzzballs known as pilling -- as well ascontracts for uniforms for 21 out of 26 Major League baseballteams.   Early last year, as the recession pinched sales, Russelldecided not to lay off staff, if possible. Instead, Russellrotated a crew of 14,100 nonunion workers through a four-daywork week, swallowing the overhead cost of keeping peopleemployed. That sent 1991 first-quarter earnings tumbling 78%from a year earlier. So much for the quarter and WallStreet's nervous Nellies; Russell saw itself as sacrificingthe bottom line temporarily to build long-term intangibles,such as worker morale and commitment to quality.   William P. Dickson Jr., Russell's vice president in chargeof personnel, says rather than cut sewing-machine operators,the company pointed at management and &quot;challenged {them} tocome up with cost savings&quot; as the recession cut sales. Thatmeant clipped travel schedules, cheaper hotel rooms and fewerseminars for the white-collar crew.   And when's the last time you saw this: Russell's two topexecutives froze their salaries at around $300,000 last year(modest for a company running near $1 billion in annualsales), and each declined to take a $100,000 bonus. (About45% of the stock is held by insiders.)   Russell has long showed an unusual commitment to itsworkers. It has spent an average of $100 million annually onautomation over five years without replacing a singleemployee with a robot. As you read this, some 500 children ofRussell employees are attending day-care centers at thecompany, or after-school programs to refine reading skills.Old-time paternalism? No. Arftul management, say the bulls onthe stock. Sales per employee -- one measure of how the staffmay or may not be kicking in for a company -- rose about 8%in 1991 to $54,511. And that's up about 15% since 1987.   &quot;I think we get an immeasurable commitment to productionand quality&quot; by helping employees, Mr. Dickson says. Buyersof Russell's goods include Walt Disney, Lands' End andWal-Mart Stores.   Steven Vannelli, a buyer of Russell when the stock was onthe ropes last year, says the high quality of the company'sclients and products gave him confidence that the shareswould move higher, despite bad news about consumer spending.&quot;They are the best at what they do,&quot; says Mr. Vannelli,portfolio manager at Kingsley Jennison, McNulty andamp; Morse, aSan Francisco firm. &quot;And with their customer base, you had tofigure that orders would come back.&quot; They did; Russellcrossed the finish line in 1991 with record annual sales of$804.5 million.   Russell doesn't sew garments overseas, except for a smallScottish operation. It controls products from start tofinish, buying raw cotton from farmers it knows, spinningyarn, dyeing it and sewing it into athletic wear. Thisstart-to-finish approach stabilizes quality and helps keepcosts down. In turn, Russell's recognizable quality gives thecompany pricing power, analysts say. Consumers don't mindpaying a bit more for goods worth their dollars. According toanalysts, Russell is pushing through a 5% price boost on somelines this year.   Today, Russell shares trade at more than 18 times thisyear's estimated pershare earnings of $2.05, a multiple toohigh for some analysts. Last week, Prudential Securitiesanalyst Deborah Bronston slapped the stock with a &quot;hold&quot;rating, &quot;purely on the basis of valuation.&quot;   But maybe investors should follow Russell's example andtake the long view. The stock is &quot;a strong hold for us,&quot; saysEric McKissack, portfolio manager at Ariel CapitalManagement, which started acquiring its hefty 2.2million-share position back in August 1987 for an averagecost of less than $20 a share.   ---   Russell Corp.
