The justices said they will review a $27,000 judgment won by aChicago Ridge, Ill., woman against the Yellow Freight System Co.,the trucking company she works for.   Lawyers for Yellow Freight are urging the justices to rule thatColeen Donnelly waited too long before filing a lawsuit invoking afederal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, that barson-the-job discrimination.   Mrs. Donnelly's lawsuit invoked the federal law within arequired 90-day deadline but the case at that time was in anIllinois state court. Lawyers for Yellow Freight said that does notmeet the deadline requirement because, its appeal contends, federalcourts have exclusive authority to hear Title VII cases.   Some federal appeals courts have ruled that such suits must befiled in federal court, but the Chicago-based 7th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals ruled that state courts have co-existing authorityto hear Title VII cases.   The 7th Circuit court noted that Congress, in passing Title VII,did not say whether lawsuits invoking the law must be filed infederal court.   ``Unless Congress includes ... an explicit statement vestingjurisdiction exclusively in federal court, state courts may presumethat they share jurisdiction concurrently with the federal courtsover a federal cause of action,'' the appeals court said.   Mrs. Donnelly applied to Yellow Freight for a job as adockworker in October 1982. Although the company was not hiring atthe time, Mrs. Donnelly was told she would be the next dockworkerhired.   Although Yellow Freight began hiring dockworkers again inFebruary 1983, Mrs. Donnelly was told repeatedly that the companywas not hiring.   She was hired 18 months after the February 1983 start-up ofhiring.   Mrs. Donnelly in early 1985 filed charges with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission, alleging sexual bias in YellowFreight's delay in hiring her.   The commission issued a right-to-sue notice on March 15, 1985 _triggering a 90-day deadline.   Mrs. Donnelly sued in state court within the deadline. But heroriginal lawsuit did not allege a Title VII violation, only aviolation of the Illinois Human Rights Act.   The suit later was amended to include allegations of a Title VIIviolation.   After Yellow Freight had the case transferred to federal court,Mrs. Donnelly was awarded $27,656.6l in back pay and prejudgmentinterest.   The case is Yellow Freight System vs. Donnelly, 89-431.</TEXT></DOC>
