An extra set of LiF TLD-700 chips were prepared for eachfield location and calibration level. At the end of quarter one, halfof the TLDs were read on the Model 4000 and the other half were readon our standard Harshaw Model 2000. This presentation compares the resultsof the two systems. The Model 4000 results are reported for two regionsof interest and for background subtraction using Harshaw Glow Curve DeconvolutionSoftware.</TEXT></DOC>
