The U.S. delegation on Monday presented a 20-page draftagreement in Geneva, Switzerland, to a meeting of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, the first such draft presented incomplete form, said Trade Representative Carla A. Hills.   Delegates from 107 countries are taking part in thenegotiations, which for the first time are trying to cover trade inservices _ everything from accounting to zoo management.   The U.S. delegation presents proposals on Wednesday aimed atabolishing export subsidies for farm products within 10 years.   A source in Geneva said Indian Delegate V. J. Ganesan told theclosed-door meeting that an agreememnt must reflect the need ofThird World countries to protect their own service companiesagainst too much foreign competiton. He was supported by Brazil,Yugoslavia and Tanzania, the source added.   Ms. Hills told a news conference that under the U.S. proposalthe world market in services would be open to the greatest possibleextent to firms everywhere.   ``They would face a fair, predictable environment for theirservices throughout the world,'' said the official summary of theproposal.   She said it seeks to:   _Enable firms from any country to set up shop in any other andbe treated like local firms   _Limit governments' distortion of trade in services throughregulations, subsidies and their own monopolies   _Require that national laws on services be administered openly.   GATT, which is an organization as well as an agreement, hasalways dealt with trade in actual goods and not in what were oncecalled ``invisibles.''   ``The problem today is that trade has outgrown the GATT,'' Ms.Hills said.   ``Areas poorly govered by GATT rules, like agriculture, or notcovered at all, like services, investment and intellectual property(itemsw such as copyrights), are of much greater importance thanthey once were.''   Now tourism, banking, insurance, airline services and computerwork can be among a country's most significant exports or imports.   ``All told, more than $1 trillion in goods and services trade isnot adequately covered by international rules of fair play,'' Ms.Hills complained.   World trade in services last year totalled $560 billion. TheUnited States exported $90 billion worth of services last year andimported only about $70 billion, making a $20 billion contributionto the nation's balance of payments.</TEXT></DOC>
