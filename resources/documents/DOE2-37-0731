The results are as follows: (1)The data of ignition delays of methane jets measured in the closed vesselcan be applied to gas burning diesel engines. (2) In order to shortenthe ignition delays to the allowable level for gas burning diesel engines,it is necessary to raise the temperature of gas in their combustion chamberabove 1,100K. (3) The heat release rates for initial combustion durationof methane jets increase in proportion to ignition delays. (10 figs,2 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
