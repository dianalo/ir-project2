(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Cuban family from Florida stranded inCanada since a pre-Christmas sightseeing trip because ofimmigration problems reportedly may soon be allowed to return home.   Immigration and Naturalization Service District DirectorBenedict J. Ferro will approve Carlos Fajardo's bid for politicalasylum within the next few weeks, ending the family's exile in FortErie, Ontario, The Buffalo News reported today.   Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two childrenhave lived on charity since Dec. 23, when they were denied re-entryinto the United States at the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls.   The couple, both considered illegal aliens, told borderauthorities that they had driven north to see snow for Christmasand had crossed the border into Canada to view Niagara Falls.   Fajardo owns a home and a small boat-building business in Miami.Officials have alleged he entered the United States illegally in1985 from Panama. His wife and her children by a previous marriageallegedly entered the country illegally in 1986 from Venezuela andan immigration judge ordered them deported last August.   Ferro would not discuss the case in detail but confirmed thatnew information could substantiate Fajardo's claims that he wouldface political persecution if he were returned to his native Cuba.   ``Mr. Fajardo's claim is clearly not frivolous,'' Ferro saidtold the News. ``If indeed it proves to rise to the level of awell-founded fear of being persecuted if returned to Cuba, we willgrant him asylum.''   ``It looks like we may be able to work something out,'' saidSister Kathleen Rimar, Fajardo's Catholic Charities attorney inBuffalo.   After they were denied re-entry, the Fajardos lived for severalweeks in a motel in Niagara Falls, Ontario, then in a Fort Erieapartment under the sponsorship of Ontario refugee groups.   Fajardo had a previous application for asylum pending, but itwas nullified when he crossed the border into Canada, officialssaid.</TEXT></DOC>
