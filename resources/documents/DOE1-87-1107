Of the 43 methods originally identified, 30 are still participatingin the program. Many of the methods are still being refined. Using alaser interferometer as a measurement standard, EPA is obtaining carefulmeasurements in a specially-constructed full-scale tank system at theirEdison, NJ, facility to define those ambient noises any detection methodmust overcome. This large body of data is used with a mathematical modelof each method; the resulting predicitons are compared with those fromverification test data obtained by the vendor at EPA's test system. 8refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
