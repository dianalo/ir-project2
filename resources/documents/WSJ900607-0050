The two California lawyers, Gordon A. Stemple and RichardF. Gerry, represented 6,000 asbestos claimants againstRaymark Industries Inc., an asbestos maker that paid $16million to tire workers nationwide for injuries claimed byMessrs. Stemple and Gerry. The company then sued the twolawyers in 1987 challenging the validity of the claims andalleging fraud and racketeering.</LP><TEXT>   In response to a pretrial motion seeking dismissal of thesuit, Judge Patrick F. Kelly, of Wichita, Kan., answered witha scalding 63-page opinion. He accused the two lawyers -- andthree doctors they employed to evaluate the claims -- offraud, deceptive solicitation and &quot;reckless disregard of thetruth.&quot;   &quot;It appears that this unusual, distasteful anddisappointing case emanates from the attorneys' greed, whichhas clouded their professional judgment; i.e., theirindifference as to whether any of the 6,000 claims meetprofessional standards or not,&quot; Judge Kelly wrote.   Messrs. Stemple and Gerry formed the National Tire WorkersLitigation Project in 1986, equipped vans with X-ray machinesand traveled to Raymark tire plants across the country in the&quot;examobiles&quot; to conduct massive employee examinations. In hisorder, the judge called the technique an &quot;unethicalnationwide solicitation process&quot; and charged that the threedoctors involved compromised their professionalresponsibility by using flawed screening procedures to churngroundless claims.   &quot;There is evidence in this case which indicates that{Messrs.} Stemple and Gerry violated ethical obligations byconducting a contrived and deceptive solicitation program,&quot;the judge wrote.   Reached at his office in Century City, Calif., Mr. Stemplesaid he disagreed with the opinion and predicted that he, Mr.Gerry and the three doctors will prevail when the case goesbefore a jury. Mr. Gerry, of San Diego, was out of town andcouldn't be reached for comment.   Raymark was a unit of Raytech Corp., a Bridgeport, Conn.,maker of fastners and brake and clutch materials, thatstripped the company of its non-asbestos-related assets andspun it off in 1988 to distance itself from asbestoslitigation. Raymark has been forced into bankruptcy-courtproceedings under the weight of more than 68,000asbestos-related claims. Last year, Raytech soughtbankruptcy-court protection.   The company has been known for particularly aggressivelitigation tactics, said Mr. Stemple, pointing to the suitagainst him as the most recent example. But Raymark lawyerWilliam L. Myers Jr., of the Philadelphia firm of Ballard,Spahr, Andrews andamp; Ingersoll, said Judge Kelly's opinion was a&quot;timely expression of judicial disapproval of mass-producedlawsuits.&quot;   ---   STUDENT-LOAN INQUIRY leads to indictment of ex-official atFlorida thrift.   A federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., returned a 25-countindictment against Jeffrey A. Flatten, charging that heconspired to defraud the U.S. Department of Education inconnection with its Guaranteed Student Loan Program. Theprogram makes low-interest loans available to students forcollege expenses.   Mr. Flatten, who headed Florida Federal Savings Bank'sstudent-loan division, was also charged with committing mailfraud and stealing government funds.   The indictment follows Florida Federal's conviction by thefederal jury for falsifying statements related togovernment-backed student loans. Last month, in what isbelieved to be the largest student-loan case ever prosecuted,the federal jury found the company guilty of 43 counts offalsifying statements between November 1986 and July 1987.Two former officers were convicted of falsifying statements.   In 1988, Florida Federal came under scrutiny for allegedlyfiling as many as 17,000 fraudulent insurance claims on $35million in student loans. The investigation helped spark amanagement shake-up that resulted in the resignation of thethrift's chairman.   The indictment against Mr. Flatten alleges that fromNovember 1986 to September 1987 he conspired with otherofficers and employees of Florida Federal to submit the17,000 fraudulent claims. Those claims, the indictment says,were supported by documents falsely reflecting that FloridaFederal performed required collection activity on the loans.   In St. Petersburg, Fla., Florida Federal officials hadn'tany comment. Mr. Flatten couldn't be reached.   ---   METROMEDIA WINS damages of $46 million in fraud suit.   Metromedia Co. sued William D. Fugazy in 1987 forallegedly fraudulently overstating the value of FugazyExpress Inc., a limousine service that Metromedia acquired in1985. Fugazy Express, which Metromedia owned for two years,is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.   In the civil-racketeering suit, Metromedia claimed Mr.Fugazy overstated the value of the company by $7 million,said Martin Shelton, an attorney for the Secaucus, N.J.,communications company. Mr. Shelton said Metromedia,controlled by billionaire John Kluge, had to invest anadditional $30 million in the company because of the allegedmisrepresentations.   The jury hearing the case in federal court in Manhattan,N.Y., awarded damages of $15 million, which Judge RobertCarter trebled under racketeering law.   Anthony Princi, an attorney for Mr. Fugazy, plans toappeal the decision.   ---   FEES MOUNT in Southmark Corp. bankruptcy proceedings.   Lawyers alone are seeking more than $8.7 million in feesin the reorganization of the real-estate and thrift concern.Investment bankers and accountants aren't far behind with feerequests totaling $7.7 million, bringing the totalprofessional fees to $16.5 million up to March 31.   &quot;That is a big chunk of assets out of this estate thatwould otherwise be available to pay creditors,&quot; U.S. TrusteeGeorge McElreath said during a hearing on the fees beforeDallas Bankruptcy Judge Steven Felsenthal.   Southmark has proposed paying its creditors about $300million in cash, notes and stock to settle debts of $2billion. The company's counsel alone are seeking almost $6.5million in fees, with the largest single amount, $3.4million, to go to the New York law firm of Shearman andamp;Sterling. Judge Felsenthal took the fee applications underconsideration.   In his comments to Judge Felsenthal, Mr. McElreath citedanother Dallas bankruptcy judge who frequently criticizeslawyers' high fees by saying they're &quot;buying a Cadillac whenthey could buy a Ford.&quot;   &quot;In this case,&quot; Mr. McElreath said, &quot;we're paying for anIndy race car.&quot;   ---   ARNOLD andamp; PORTER will market services with defenseconsultant.   The Washington, D.C., law firm entered a &quot;teamingagreement&quot; with Interpar, a new defense-consulting firm thatwill specialize in accords between foreign governments andcompanies to market arms to more than one country. Theventure is aimed at helping the defense and aerospaceindustries adjust to the decline in defense budgets here andabroad as the Cold War winds down.   In recent years, Arnold andamp; Porter has launched severalsubsidiaries that perform non-legal work, including theconsulting firm Apco Associates. But according to Arnold andamp;Porter partner Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general counsel tothe Senate Armed Services Committee, Interpar isn't an Arnoldandamp; Porter subsidiary, and has no financial links to the lawfirm. Interpar Chairman Milton Lohr and President VitalijGarber are former high-ranking defense officials in theReagan and Carter administrations.   Under the &quot;teaming agreement,&quot; lawyers for Arnold andamp; Porterwill make joint presentations with Interpar to potentialclients. The two firms will also notify their own clientsthat the firms are available to work together, althoughclients will be required to hire the concerns separately.According to Mr. Smith, the company determined that separatetransactions are required by the legal canons of ethics.   Separately, a top Arnold andamp; Porter trade litigator, PatrickMacrory, will leave the firm for the Washington office ofAkin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer andamp; Feld.   According to Akin Gump Managing Partner Bruce McLean, Mr.Macrory will be working on trade matters in the firm'sWashington office and also in a new 25-lawyer Brussels officethat the firm opened last year.   ---   FDIC SUES LAWYERS: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. isseeking $30 million in damages from three Texas lawyers whoadvised the defunct Western Savings Association of Dallas tomake a series of loans that allegedly violated federalregulations.
