In an ironic twist, the observers say, Beijing's attempts toimprove the lot of the Tibetan people have caused a crisis ofhigher expectations, prompting Tibetans to seek faster change froma recalcitrant Beijing.   These observers predict that rioting in the province's capital,Lhasa, on March 5 will prompt an iron-fisted crackdown and thereturn of hardline Chinese rule to the ``roof of the world.''   Such a crackdown will postpone again any possibility ofresolving China's main minority problem, ensuring renewed sufferingfor Tibetans.   ``Tibetans are grabbing for a mile when the Chinese are offeringthem an inch,'' said a State Department official, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``We see little possibility forresolution.''   ``After (the disturbances March 5) a military response is theonly way,'' said Tom Grunfeld, a Tibetan expert and professor atthe State University of New York's Empire State College inManhattan. ``It's part of the sad equation in Tibet.''   China has claimed sovereignty over the Himalayan region sincethe 13th century. But many Tibetans view the Chinese as anoccupying force and yearn for independence.   In 1950 the Chinese Red Army entered Tibet and Beijing promisedTibetan leaders a measure of autonomy. It failed to deliver.   Nine years later, Tibetans rebelled. The Chinese army crackeddown and the Dalai Lama, Tibet's temporal and spiritual leader,fled to India.   In 1966, conditions further deteriorated with the onset ofChina's ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution.   Atheist Chinese Red Guards, charging that Tibet was backward andfeudalistic, attempted to destroy its Buddhist culture. Of Tibet's3,000 temples only a handful survived. Thousands of monks andreligious pilgrims were slaughtered.   Grunfeld said his interviews with refugees gave no indicationsof sustained unrest among the Tibetan people from 1959 to 1976.   ``The Chinese clamped a very tight lid on Tibet. Any protest wascrushed immediately.''   Conditions in Tibet began to improve after the end of theCultural Revolution with the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung in 1976.   Hu Yaobang, the former Communist Party boss, went to Lhasa andissued a public apology for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution.   For the first time since 1959, Tibetans were allowed to travelfrom one county to the next without government permission.   Hospitals were built, the Tibetan language was allowed back inthe schools and taxes were cut or eliminated. China opened itsborder with Nepal, allowing renewed contact with the Tibetan exilecommunity.   With an eye to a profitable tourist trade, the Chinese alsobegan repairing some of the monasteries destroyed by the RedGuards. A prohibition on Buddhist proselytzing was lifted and youngmonks appeared again in the temples.   In 1980, representatives of the Dalai Lama began negotiationswith the Chinese to set conditions for his return to China.Negotiations broke off two years later because the Chinese insistedthat he live in Beijing and he wanted to live in Lhasa.   ``The Chinese are pumping millions of dollars into the regionand there are only 3 million people there,'' Grunfeld said.``Things are looking up, especially in the cities.''   Emboldened by reforms, Tibetans staged pro-independencedemonstrations in September and October last year and again March 5and 6.   The demonstrations were led by monks, Tibet's traditionalsoldiers, who Grunfeld said, don't fit the Western idea of ``acontemplative individual making cheese and wine.''   The observers said China's reforms prompted the riots becausethey allowed Tibetans to congregate more freely without fear ofinstant repression. The reforms also allowed contact with Tibetansabroad. And by opening Tibet to Western tourists, the Chineseprovided the monks with an international stage for their protests.   The success of the reforms also played a hand.   ``The reforms have created among some Tibetan refugees a senseof desperation,'' said the State Department official. ``It's likethey said, `We've got to act now or we'll never be able to do itagain.'''   Many Tibetans claim the reforms are insidious, aimed at turningTibet into a living museum to boost China's tourism industry.   They also claim their land is being overrun by hordes ofChinese, sent in from Beijing to Sinicize the remote region.   Grunfeld says the truth of that allegation depends on how onedefines Tibet.   Tibet's current boundaries correspond to its traditionalpolitical influence. But Tibetan activists define Tibet as the areaof its traditional cultural influence which includes large tractsof Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.   Grunfeld said thousands of Chinese settlers are moving to thosethree provinces but few are going to Tibet.   But he added that the region cannot lure enough competentChinese officials to manage it.   ``It's a dumping ground for incompetents. The Chinese can't getanyone to go there.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, March 28</NOTE></DOC>
