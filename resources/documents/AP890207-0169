The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in a circular sentto national banks and examiners, said ``a number of national banktrust departments'' may have accepted incentives from firms thatsponsor mutual funds or other investment funds in return for puttingbank assets in funds offered by the firms.   It said the incentives appear to have included discounts orrebates on fees for other services such as accounting andadministrative work, computer goods or services, and seminars andtravel expenses for bank personnel.   The memo reminded banks that their investment decisions should be``based exclusively on the best interest of trust customers.''   It said bank laws prohibit bank trust departments ``fromreceiving any financial benefits, including discounts or rebates ongoods or services purchased, or other items of value, in exchangefor investing trust funds in particular investments.''   ``Trustees must not place themselves in a position where theirjudgments concerning the optimal investment for trust accounts maybe influenced by the trustee's receipt of financial benefits forselecting a particular investment,'' the banking circular said.   The comptroller said banks that accept prohibited financialbenefits may be subject to ``significant liability'' for breachingtheir duty and to enforcement action by the comptroller's office andmay be required to provide reimbursement for the benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
