HOME  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Jim Dickey contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;I saw Mommy stood up, and then she fell down,&quot; the daughter, NguyenNguyen, said Tuesday as she recovered from a grazing back wound at thefamily's small duplex apartment in the 3300 block of Senter Road in San Jose.;   Her mother, who was on a couch, was wounded in the abdomen and elbow whenthe bullets tore into the home at 10:30 p.m., police Sgt. Rich Saito said. Hercondition was upgraded from serious to stable Tuesday, said a nursingsupervisor at a San Jose hospital.;    Her son, Ry Nguyen, who was on thefloor with his sister when shots rang out, was hit in the right ring fingerand was scheduled to undergo surgery today. The father, Quoc Nguyen, 31, wascut by flying glass and was not hospitalized.;    &quot;My wife thought it wasfirecrackers,&quot; said Quoc Nguyen, &quot;so she got up to look. Had she known (it wasbullets), she would have been OK.&quot;;    Quoc Nguyen said his family had heardabout armed robberies in the United States before they arrived here lastOctober, but they had few possessions so they did not worry.;    &quot;I didn'texpect this. We thought we were just going to go to school, find a job andeverything will be OK,&quot; he said. &quot;Had we picked on someone, then it would havebeen understandable, but we didn't.&quot;;    Quoc Nguyen said he believes theassailant mistakenly shot into his home while gunning for a neighbor whoappeared to have been in a fight Monday. But a resident in the neighbor'shouse said no one there knows anything about the shooting.;    Police, whosaid six shots were fired into the home, don't know if someone just randomlyshot into the home or deliberately set out to hurt the Nguyens.;    &quot;He (thefather) is a family man,&quot; Sgt. Saito said. &quot;He doesn't have any problems. Hedoesn't have any shaky contact that we're aware of.&quot;;    The shooting posedyet another problem for the immigrant family trying to forge a new life.;   &quot;They've just come here. With no money, nothing,&quot; said relative Be Nguyen.&quot;And now this.&quot;;    The father and daughter fled Vietnam on a boat about twoyears ago, spending seven days at sea as they headed to Hong Kong. The motherand son followed six months later by boat, spending one day at sea before theywere picked up by an American ship. The family stayed in a Philippine camp forabout a year.;    The couple had worked in a textile factory in Vietnam, andthe husband hoped to learn auto mechanics here. They receive $150 a month infood stamps, and their $800 welfare check barely covers the $650 rent andutilities. They only have about $20 left a month, so Quoc Nguyen's parents --who immigrated in 1985 -- help them.;    Inside the bullet-scarred homeTuesday, the grandmother, Loan Nguyen, talked about moving.;    &quot;It's tooscary living here,&quot; she said. She traced one slug that traveled the length ofthe home, passing under a Buddhist altar in the living room.;    Witnessestold police a person ran away from the family's front lawn after the shooting.They described the person as either Asian or Hispanic, 25 to 30 years old, 5feet 9, 180 to 190 pounds with dark hair. He was wearing a white shirt anddark pants.;    One witness told investigators a dark-colored Datsun 280Z leftthe area about the same time, but the grandmother said a neighbor told hermore than one attacker fired from a van. Another witness said three cars -- aMazda RX7, a van and an unidentified vehicle -- were seen leaving the scene.;   Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Sgt. Saito at(408) 277-4161.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DE TRAN AND BETTY BARNACLE, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910731  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  733  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 31, 199100213131,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
