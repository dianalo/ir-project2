He was a 33-year-old advertising man. The phonesin his apartment building were out of order, so, in lateevening, he stepped out to the corner phone to call acolleague. A would-be robber came by and shot him dead.   Murders in New York are hardly unusual -- last year, therewere 1,905, one every four and a half hours -- but the murderin my generally quiet neighborhood was different. It wasn't adomestic dispute. It wasn't a drug deal. It wasn't a gangfight. Rather, it was a robbery in which the holdup man,according to police, was a homeless person, one of severalwho have taken over a little nearby park where mothers andchildren used to gather.</LP><TEXT>   The Times ran his picture last week. I've seen him often.   I read about the murder the same day I read yet anotherstory about yet another increase in the amount of money we'regoing to have to pay to keep the savings-and-loan industryafloat. Now, it's up around $500 billion, including interest.I'm sure there will be higher estimates in coming months. Butwhat difference does it make? The figures became numbingmonths ago.   Yet I wondered: Would my neighbor be alive if just some ofthat money had been earmarked to help the homeless? How muchmoney is the federal government spending on the poor,deranged people who have no place to live?   The answer, nationwide, is about $598 million. That's justa little more than one-tenth of 1% of the amount we'll spendon the savings-and-loan scandal. That puts in perspective, alittle, the enormity and enormousness of the scandal. Here isthe government spending half a trillion dollars to rectifybad decisions -- sometimes just dumb, sometimes criminal --made by executives and directors who, it turns out, wereaccountable to no one.   Why isn't anyone upset about this?   Here are some other comparisons with that $500 billionbailout:   The entire cost of World War II, in current dollars andincluding service-connected veterans' benefits, is about $460billion. That's $40 billion less than the bailout.   The cost of the Vietnam War, including benefits, stands at$172 billion. Korea was $70 billion. World War I was $63billion. The Civil War was $7 billion -- 1 1/2% of the costof the savings-and-loan debacle.   The National Cancer Institute spent $1.3 billion on cancerresearch last year. The National Institutes for Health spent$582 million on heart disease, $171 million on lung disease,$170 million on blood disease. Add them up: Less thanone-half of 1% of the Sandamp;L money.   Why isn't anyone upset?   Across the country, corporations, foundations andindividuals give away about $100 billion a year. In otherwords, if every charitable gift from every company, everyfoundation, every living human and the will of everyone whodied this year were earmarked to bail out thesavings-and-loan industry, it wouldn't be enough to handlethe cost even without worrying about the interest on thatcost.   If you add up the budget of every state, you get totalexpenditures of about $450 billion, or at least you do if youadd up the fiscal 1987 figures, the latest I could find.Again, less than the savings-and-loan bailout.   You get the idea. It's hard to find anything in thiscountry -- or in history -- as costly as the savings-and-loanscandal. No war, no defense program, no social program, noother scandal has ever cost what this will cost.   Why isn't anyone upset?   All of the ads in all of the newspapers, on all of thetelevision stations and networks, on all of the billboardsand everywhere else cost the advertisers about $100 billion ayear. If you add up the assets of Prudential and MetropolitanLife and Equitable Life and Aetna and Teachers Insurance andNew York Life and Connecticut General and Travelers and JohnHancock and Northwestern Mutual you still don't get to $500billion. The 1988 profits of all the companies on the Fortune500 list added up to just $115 billion.   Why isn't anyone upset?   Probably because the savings-and-loan horror isn't a crimelike the murder of the man in my neighborhood. There is noone, identifiable victim, other than the taxpayer. There isno one, identifiable perpetrator, other than the system.   Yet, again, you wonder: If just a piece of that moneycould be directed elsewhere, how many murders could beprevented, how many homeless could be helped, how manydiseases could be conquered, how many police could be hired,how many parks could be built?   For it just isn't right. The advertising man in myneighborhood is dead. The homeless man in my neighborhood isin jail. But the people -- officers and directors, mainly --who are costing us $500 billion, robbing us of money to curediseases or educate the poor or just pay off our debt, arestill free to enjoy the riches of life.
