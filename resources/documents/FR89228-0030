Interested persons were invited to submit commentsby December 8, 1976. Reply comments in response to comments filed in theinitial comment period could be submitted by January 7, 1977. In accordance with andSection;330.10(a)(10), the data and information consideredby the Panel were put on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305),Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD20857, after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. The agency's proposed regulation, in the form of a tentative final monograph,for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and antiasthmatic drug productsis being issued in the following segments: anticholinergics and expectorants,bronchodilators, antitussives, nasal decongestants, antihistamines, andcombinations. The first segment, the tentative final monograph for anticholinergicdrug products and expectorant drug products, was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 9, 1982 (47 FR 30002). Interested personswere invited to file by September 7, 1982, written comments, objections,or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner of Food and Drugsregarding the proposal. Interested persons were invited to file commentson the agency's economic impact determination by November 8, 1982. Newdata could have been submitted until July 11, 1983, and comments on thenew data until September 9, 1983. Final agency action occurs with the publicationof this final monograph, which is a final rule establishing a monographfor OTC expectorant drug products. In a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 27, 1982 (47 FR 37934), the agencyadvised that it had extended the period for comments, objections, or requestsfor oral hearing for OTC anticholinergic drug products and expectorantdrug products. The notice allowed the period for comments, objections,or requests for oral hearing to be extended to November 8, 1982. The agency's final rule, in the form of a final monograph, for OTC cold,cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and antiasthmatic drug products is alsobeing published in segments. Final agency action on expectorant drug productsoccurs with the publication of this document, which establishes andSection;andSection;341.3(d), 341.18, and 341.78 and adds professional labeling informationin andSection; 341.90(d) for OTC expectorant drug products in Part 341 (21CFR Part 341). Combination drug products containing expectorant drugs areaddressed in the tentative final monograph on combination cough-cold drugproducts which was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 12, 1988 (53 FR 30522). The agency'sfinal action on OTC anticholinergic drug products was published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46582).In the preamble to the agency's proposed rule on OTC expectorant drug products(47 FR 30002), the agency stated that no expectorant active ingredientshad been found to be generally recognized as safe and effective and notmisbranded, but that Category I labeling was being proposed in that documentin the event that data were submitted that resulted in the upgrading ofany ingredient to monograph status in the final rule. In this final rule,one expectorant ingredient, guaifenesin, is included in the monograph.The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Oral Cavity Drug Products (Oral CavityPanel) reviewed safety and effectiveness data on four expectorant ingredients(potassium iodide, ammonium chloride, tolu balsam, and horehound), butdid not classify any expectorants in Category I in its report publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 25, 1982 (47 FR 22920). In the tentativefinal monograph for OTC oral health care anesthetic/analgesic, astringent,debriding agent/oral wound cleanser, and demulcent drug products, publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of Janaury 27, 1988 (53 FR 2436 at 2448), theagency referred the data on these four expectorant ingredients to the rulemakingfor OTC expectorant drug products because the ingredients had been reviewedearlier and more extensively by the Cough-Cold Panel and because no newdata were submitted to the agency in support of the effectiveness of anyexpectorant for oral health care use. In this final rule, based on a lackof safety and/or effectiveness data, the agency concludes that the fourexpectorant ingredients (potassium iodide, ammonium chloride, tolu balsam,and horehound) considered by the Oral Cavity Panel are nonmonograph ingredients.The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) now provide that anytesting necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness issues that formerlyresulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of theresults of that testing or any other data, must be done during the OTCdrug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.Accordingly, FDA is no longer using the terms ``Category I'' (generallyrecognized as safe and effective and not misbranded), ``Category II'' (notgenerally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``CategoryIII'' (available data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective,and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage, but is usinginstead the terms ``monograph conditions'' (old Category I) and ``nonmonographconditions'' (old Categories II and III).As discussed in the proposed regulation for OTC expectorant drug products(47 FR 30003), the agency advises that the conditions under which the drugproducts that are subject to this monograph will be generally recognizedas safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will beeffective 12 months after the date of publication in the <T4>Federal Reigster</T4>. Therefore, on or after February 28, 1990, noOTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonographcondition, i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generallyrecognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded, may be initiallyintroduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerceunless it is the subject of an approved application. Any OTC expectorantdrug product that is subject to the monograph, whether formulated as asingle ingredient or a combination drug product, must meet the requirementsof this final rule upon its effective date. Further, any OTC drug productsubject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabled after the effectivedate of the monograph must be in compliance with the monograph regardlessof the date the product was initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouragedto comply voluntarily with the monograph at the earliest possible date.In response to the proposed rule on OTC expectorant drug products, fivedrug manufacturers, two drug manufacturer associations, one health professional,and one health care professional society submitted comments on expectorants.There was one request for a hearing. Copies of the comments and the hearingrequest received are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch.Any additional information that has come to the agency's attention sincepublication of the proposed rule is also on public display in the DocketsManagement Branch.In proceeding with this final monograph, the agency has considered allcomments, new data, the request for an oral hearing, and the changes inthe procedural regulations. A summary of the comments and FDA's responsesto them follows. A discussion of the new data and the request for an oralhearing are contained in those responses.All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to the submissionsmade by interested persons pursuant to the call-for-data notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of August 9, 1972 (37 FR 16029) or to additionalinformation that has come to the agency's attention since publication ofthe notice of proposed rulemaking. The volumes are on public display inthe Dockets Management Branch (address above).<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments</ITAG>A. General Comments on Expectorant Drug Products1. One comment contended that OTC drug monographs are interpretive, asopposed to substantive, regulations. The comment referred to statementson this issue submitted earlier to other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings.The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 of the preambleto the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 11, 1972 (37 FR 9464) and in paragraph3 of the preamble to the tentative final monograph for antacid drug products,published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260). FDA reaffirmsthe conclusions stated in those documents. Court decisions have confirmedthe agency's authority to issue substantive regulations by rulemaking.(See, e.g., <T3>National Nutritional Foods Association </T3>v. <T3>Weinberger</T3>, 512 F. 2d 688, 696-98 (2d Cir. 1975) and <T3>National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers </T3>v. <T3>FDA</T3>, 487 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).)2. One comment disagreed with the agency's statement that ``no expectorantactive ingredients have been determined to be generally recognized as safeand effective and not misbranded'' (47 FR 30002). Arguing that the evidenceto support the safety and effectiveness of these ingredients may not beconclusive, the comment stated that most of these drugs are not unsafewhen used as directed by the manufacturers. The drugs may be effectivein a ``significant proportion of patients,'' the comment maintained, andit would be desirable to examine the physiologic and pharmacologic effectsof these drugs to determine whether larger than recommended doses do havemeasurable beneficial or harmful effects in patients who claim that ``standard''doses produce subjective benefits. The comment added that there is evidencethat larger than recommended doses of expectorants cause nausea or emesis,and there is a pharmacologic basis for believing that subemetic doses canimprove respiratory tract mucus clearance.The comment pointed out that the Panel recognized that the available datashowed conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of guaifenesin andthat the experts disagreed on the appropriate dosage for OTC use of thisingredient (47 FR 30006). According to the comment, if tests on guaifenesinshow that the ingredient has emetic quality, it could be assumed that othercommonly used expectorants may have similar qualities because the emeticquality is common to most oral expectorants. Because there is an ongoingtest on guaifenesin, the comment emphasized the need to avoid a final ``commitment''regarding the effectiveness of oral expectorants.The agency's statement that ``no expectorant active ingredients have beendetermined to be generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded''was a tentative conclusion based on a lack of adequate studies at thattime to support the use of these drugs for their claimed effects. The agencyagrees with the Panel that although many of the expectorants on the marketwith long usage are generally safe, most lack evidence of effectiveness(41 FR 38355). It is believed that many of the drugs that are claimed tohave expectorant activity act reflexly by irritating the gastric mucosa,which in turn stimulates the respiratory tract secretions (Ref. 1). Salineexpectorants, ammonium salts, citrates, iodides, antimony and potassiumtartrate, ipecac expectorants, creosotes, and guaiacols are included inthis group of drugs. Some experimental evidence suggests that these substancesdo increase respiratory tract secretions, but the data are sparse and unconvincing.Except for data on guaifenesin, no new test data were submitted on anyof these ingredients following publication of the tentative final monograph.Thus, at present, adequate data do not exist to support general recognitionof any of these other OTC ingredients as effective expectorants.Gauifenesin was classified by the Panel in Category III for further studyas an expectorant active ingredient. After reviewing new effectivenessdata, FDA determined that the data supported the effectiveness of guaifenesinas an expectorant; therefore, guaifenesin is included in this final monographas an expectorant (see comment 5 below).Manufacturers may test nonmonograph expectorant ingredients to determinewhether the Panel's recommended doses or even larger doses are effective.If the larger than recommended doses are not within a known safety range,additional safety studies will be needed. Any clinical testing of nonmonographingredients should be conducted under the provisions of a Notice of ClaimedInvestigational Exemption for a New Drug (IND) (Form FDA-1571) (OMB ApprovalNo. 0910-0014), as set forth in 31 CFR 312.1.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Swinyard, E.A., ``Respiratory Drugs,'' <T3>in</T3> ``Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,'' 17th Ed., Mack PublishingCo., Easton, PA, p. 867, 1985.</ITAG>3. In response to the agency's request for definitions of the term ``expectorant''in lay language (47 FR 30004), one comment suggested that ``expectorant''be defined as ``a drug taken by mouth which loosens abnormal secretionsin the lung and thereby enables sputum to be coughed up more easily.''The comment added that, in defining an expectorant drug, it should be recognizedthat expectorant drugs are those which are usually given by mouth whereasthose that are taken by inhalation may be ``mucolytics,'' ``surfactants,''and ``bronchorrheics.'' It pointed out that in other countries, oral expectorantdrugs include ``bronchomucotropics'' and ``mucoregulators,'' and some ``mucolytics''may be given by mouth as well as by inhalation.By inviting public comment on definitions for ``expectorant,'' the agencyacknowledged the difficulty in defining this word in lay terms. However,the agency concludes that the definition offered by the comment for theterm ``expectorant'' is not clearer or more appropriate than that proposedby the agency in andSection; 341.3 (47 FR 30009), although one of the comment'ssuggestions is being adopted.At this time, only an oral expectorant (guaifenesin) is included in themonograph. Therefore, the agency agrees that it is appropriate to includein the definition that expectorants are for oral use. The comment's suggestedphrase ``a drug taken by mouth'' has been paraphrased to read ``a drugtaken orally.'' Since no expectorants for inhalation use are included inthe monograph, it is not necessary to separate expectorant drugs into ``mucolytics,''``surfactants,'' and ``bronchorrheics'' as suggested by the comment. Thephrase ``abnormal secretions in the lung'' may be misleading because otherareas of the respiratory tract, in addition to the lungs, may also be thesite of mucus secretions. The use of the word ``abnormal'' might also undulyalarm consumers. Therefore, andSection; 341.3 of this final monograph containsthe following definition of expectorant: ``a drug taken orally to promoteor facilitate the removal of secretions from the respiratory airways.''B. Comments on Specific OTC Expectorant Active Ingredients4. One comment stated that it is not clear why beechwood creosote is classifiedas an antitussive and a nasal decongestant because current evidence suggeststhat it acts only as an expectorant. The comment did not submit any additionalinformation.The comment's statement was in reference to the agency's discussion at47 FR 30006 that beechwood creosote was classified in Category III by thePanel as an expectorant, antitussive, and nasal decongestant. The Panelreviewed several submissions on combination products containing beechwoodcreosote, for which nasal decongestant and cough relief claims were made(Ref. 1). The Panel also reviewed one reference that reported some increasesof respiratory tract fluid in animals given high doses of beechwood creosote,indicating a possible usefulness as an expectorant (Ref. 2). Although beechwoodcreosote was found safe for antitussive, nasal decongestant, and expectorantuse, the Panel found the data insufficient to demonstrate effectivenessfor any of these uses. Accordingly, the Panel placed beechwood creosotein Category III for antitussive, nasal decongestant, and expectorant useand recommended additional studies to upgrade the ingredient to CategoryI.In the tentative final monographs on OTC antitussive drug products (48FR 48576 at 48590) and nasal decongestant drug products (50 FR 2220 at2235), the agency agreed with the Panel's Category III classification ofbeechwood creosote. No new data have been submitted to the agency to demonstratethe effectiveness of beechwood creosote as an expectorant; therefore, theingredient is not included in this final monograph for OTC expectorantdrug products.<ITAG tagnum="81">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volumes 040208, 040235, and 040289.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Stevens, M.

One comment submitted a study to support the reclassification of guaifenesinas an expectorant from Category III to Category I (Ref. 1). The commentrequested an oral hearing with respect to the omission of guaifenesin asa Category I expectorant in the tentative final monograph on grounds thatthe data submitted and the drug's record of safe and effective use forover 50 years establish guaifenesin as a generally recognized safe andeffective expectorant. The comment also requested an oral hearing on theground that the record is devoid of any evidence which would support afinding that guaifenesin containing products labeled for use as an expectorantare misbranded.In the tentative final monograph for OTC expectorant drug products (47FR 30002 at 30005), the agency tentatively adopted the Panel's CategoryIII classification of guaifenesin, because of insufficient effectivenessdata, and stated that one additional well-designed, double-blind studyin which subjective evaluations are correlated with objective measurementswould be needed to upgrade guaifenesin from Category III to Category I.A study was submitted to satisfy this requirement.The agency has reviewed the study and concludes that the study and thedata previously evaluated by the Panel are adequate to support the reclassificationof guaifenesin as an expectorant from Category III to Category I. Thisrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in a domiciledpopulation of 40 patients with chronic bronchitis accompanied by productivecough. The purpose of the study was to equate subjective improvement andevaluations of difficulty in raising sputum with objective measurementsof expectorant action, i.e., an increase in sputum volume and a decreasein sputum viscosity. The results showed that over the first 4 to 6 daysthere was an initial increase in the volume of sputum produced by the patientswho received guaifenesin, followed by a reduction. The total sputum volumefor the 15-day study period was not significantly different between placeboand guaifenesin patients; however, the sputum volume produced by the guaifenesinpatients at day 15 was approximately one-third the sputum volume producedby the placebo patients. This was accompanied by changes in the appearanceand viscosity of the sputum and an improvement in the subjective assessmentof the difficulty in raising sputum. Four patients receiving guaifenesinexperienced a complete clearing of sputum production. Placebo patientsshowed a gradual reduction in sputum volume, but changes in sputum characterand subjective assessment were much less pronounced. No patient in theplacebo group had clearing of symptoms or clearing of sputum.Statistical analysis of the data showed that the mean percentage of totalsputum volume expectorated by day 7 was significantly greater for patientstaking guaifenesin than placebo (69.3 percent versus 53.7 percent, p andless;0.001). The mean number of days to expectoration of 75 percent of the totalsputum volume was significantly lower on guaifenesin than on placebo (8.40versus 10.65 days, p andless; 0.001). For sputum viscosity and difficultyof raising sputum, mean values on day 15 and mean total severity scoreswere significantly lower in the guaifenesin group than in the placebo group(p andless; 0.001). Scatterplots suggested a fairly strong correlation betweensputum parameters and subjective symptom evaluations. The agency concludesthat the data provide clinical evidence of the expectorant action of guaifenesin.Therefore, guaifenesin is being included as an expectorant ingredient inthe final monograph for OTC expectorant drug products.The study was conducted using a 10-milliliter dose of 190 milligrams (mg)guaifenesin three times a day. Although this dosage is in the lower rangeof the Panel's recommended dose, the agency believes that, based on allof the data in the administrative record, the Panel's recommended dosageshould be used in the final monograph (andSection; 341.78(d)) as follows:``Adults and children 12 years of age and over: oral dosage is 200 to 400milligrams every 4 hours not to exceed 2,400 milligrams in 24 hours. Children6 to under 12 years of age: oral dosage is 100 to 200 miligrams every 4hours not to exceed 1,200 milligrams in 24 hours. Children 2 to under 6years of age: oral dosage is 50 to 100 milligrams every 4 hours not toexceed 600 milligrams in 24 hours. Children under 2 years of age: consulta doctor.''The agency's detailed comments on the data are on file in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) (Ref. 2).Because guaifenesin has been reclassified from Category III to monographstatus, the agency concludes that the comment's request for a hearing ismoot.<ITAG tagnum="81">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. LET077, Docket No. 76N-052C, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Letter from W.E.

Three comments requested that the indications for expectorants (guaifenesin)be expanded to include a cough reduction claim. One comment stated thatexpectorants help ease cough by relieving the bronchial passageways ofbothersome mucus, by relieving irritated membranes in the respiratory passageways,and by stimulating the flow of respiratory tract secretions, which allowsciliary motion and coughing to move the loosened material through the pharnyxmore easily. The comment added that recognition of these facts is well-documentedand cited the Panel's report (41 FR 38355), several published and unpublishedstudies (Refs. 1 through 6), and other standard reference textbooks (Refs.7 and 8) in support of its statements.Another comment stated that expectorants should specifically be indicatedfor relief of a dry, nonproductive cough because these terms are more meaningfulto consumers. The comment explained that consumers will be better ableto identify that they need an expectorant if terms such as ``dry, hackingor irritating cough,'' or ``upper chest cough'' are used in the labeling.The third comment stated that cough relief is generally recognized as anend benefit of the use of an expectorant and agreed with and cited mostof the information that was discussed by the first comment (Refs. 1 through5, 9, and 10). In addition, this comment submitted a new study on the effectof guaifenesin on cough induced by citric acid aerosol challenge (Ref.11). The comment requested that the phrase ``to help relieve cough'' beadded at the end of each of the indications for use provided under (1)and (2) of proposed andSection; 341.78(b) of the tentative final monographfor expectorant drug products.The agency has reviewed the submitted data and concludes that the dataare insufficient to support a specific cough reduction (antitussive) claimfor guaifenesin (Refs. 1 through 11). Connell et al. (Ref. 2) studied theeffect of guaifenesin in 20 patients with cough associated with acute bronchitis,bronchitis with asthma, and chronic pulmonary fibrosis, and in 12 patientswith chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. A few patients reported no subjectiveimprovement, but the majority of patients noted that expectoration waseasier and freer, and that useless, irritating cough was diminished, withthe most striking results in patients with acute bronchitis with dry, irritatingcough. The agency does not consider this uncontrolled study adequate todemonstrate that guaifenesin reduces cough. Few details of the study wereprovided, and all evaluations were subjective and undocumented.In phase I of their study, Stevens et al. (Ref. 3) studied the effect ofguaifenesin on the respiratory tract fluid of cats and rabbits; in phaseII they compared the antitussive effect of guaifenesin in tablet form withplacebo tablets in humans. The patient population consisted of medicalstudents who were asked to record as accurately as possible the numberof coughs per day whenever the student had a cold. The investigators concludedthat guaifenesin had a sedative effect upon cough, probably, in view ofthe phase I animal experiments, due to an increased output of respiratorytract fluid. The agency finds that this study was not well-controlled,is sparsely detailed, and lacks objective measurement of cough.Hayes et al. (Ref. 4) conducted a two-phase study on the effectivenessof guaifenesin as a expectorant. Each phase was open labeled and involved50 subjects with stable cough due to chronic disease (pulmonary tuberculosis,bronchiectasis, or bronchitis). The effect of the drug on sputum tenaciousness,frequency of cough, and overall severity of cough was subjectively evaluated.The authors reported that in phase I, guaifenesin was credited with reducingthe number of coughs in 54 percent of the testing periods (not a 54-percentreduction). In phase II, the frequency of cough was reduced in 59 percentof the testing periods. The agency finds this study unacceptable becauseonly subjective assessments were made and results were reported as changesobserved in 150 ``periods'' of assessment without futher information withrespect to what constituted a period; therefore, no comparability for measurementcould be established. It also is not clear whether the product studiedcontained an oral sympathomimetic ingredient (desoxyephedrine hydrochloride)in addition to guaifenesin. Additionally, phase I of the study was uncontrolled,and in phase II the vehicle was given during the washout periods. The agencynotes that Cass et al. (Ref. 9), discussed below, indicated that the vehiclewas shown to have activity. Thus, the only baseline for phase II of theHayes study was pretreatment.Schwartz et al. (Ref. 5) tested the relative merits of potassium iodideand a product containing a combination of guaifenesin and desoxyephedrinehydrochloride on cough and pulmonary function in asthmatic patients. Thestudy is inadequate because details are lacking concerning the measurementof efficacy parameters and because the guaifenesin product contained anadditional ingredient.Three unpublished studies (Protocols 06, 08, and 14) and other informationcited by one comment had previously been submitted to the agency to establishthe effectiveness of guaifenesin as an expectorant (Ref. 6). The agencyconcluded that the studies were not sufficient to demonstrate the effectivenessof guaifenesin (Ref. 12). Cough frequency was assessed in the studies,but was measured subjectively; not objective cough-counting techniqueswere used. Thus, these studies are unacceptable to demonstrate a coughreduction claim.The standard references cited by the comment did not contain any data todemonstrate a cough reduction claim for guaifenesin (Refs. 7 and 8).Cass et al. (Ref. 9) measured the effectiveness of three antitussives inpatients with cough due to chronic respiratory disease. The drugs usedwere terpin hydrate, ammonium chloride, an aromatic syrup (placebo), anda product containing a combination of 100 mg of guaifenesin and 1 mg ofdesoxyephedrine hydrochloride. The placebo served as the vehicle for alltest preparations. This was a double-blind study with no washout betweenregimens. Subjective scores were determined on side effects, effects oncough, effects on sputum volume and tenaciousness, taste preference, andoverall efficacy. The physician's and technican's assessments of efficacywere also subjectively scored. The study reports that all regimens reducedcough, but that only the aromatic syrup and the product containing guaifenesinand desoxyephedrine hydrochloride reached statistical significance, which``is not marked.'' For overall efficacy, the product containing guaifenesinand desoxyephedrine hydrochloride was recorded as the only preparationfor which statistical significance was achieved. The agency finds thisstudy unacceptable because the selection criteria do not adequately controlvariables, and this negates the value of the study. Additionally, the guaifenesinpreparation contained desoxyephedrine hydrochloride, and the effect ofthis ingredient is not explained or evaluated. Moreover, the fact that20 percent of the patients were discharged before the study was completedsuggests that the inclusion criterion of cough did not ensure comparability.Packman (Ref. 11) compared the antitussive effect of guaifenesin (100 and200 mg) versus aqueous placebo on artificially induced cough in the 3 hoursfollowing administration. This was a single-blind, crossover study in which37 subjects received one of the three treatments on three separate occasionsat 7-day intervals. Subjects were challenged with citric acid aerosol at30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours after dosing. Baseline cough countswere required to be in the range of 10 to 15 coughs. Coughs were recordedon a coded pneumotach recording. The sponsor concluded that, when comparedwith baseline, both 100 mg and 200 mg guaifenesin demonstrated significantlygreater reduction in cough counts than placebo at all post-treatment timepoints.Although this study noted the superiority of single doses of guaifenesinover a placebo control in reducing the number of coughs occurring in healthysubjects after artificial induction of cough with citric acid, the agencyhas reservations about the use of citric acid aerosol induced cough studiesfor cough claims for expectorants. As discussed in the tentative finalmonograph for OTC antitussive drug products (48 FR 48583), the agency doesnot consider induced cough studies alone as adequate to demonstrate theantitussive effectiveness of an ingredient. Likewise, induced cough studiesare not adequate alone to demonstrate a cough reduction claim for expectorants.Moreover, in view of the recent study by Kuhn et al. (Ref. 13), discussedbelow, that failed to show any difference in cough between placebo andguaifenesin in patients with cough due to natural disease, the value ofinduced cough studies is questionable. Therefore, the agency concludesthat the Packman study is unacceptable to demonstrate a cough relief claim.Studies to support the efficacy of guaifenesin in relieving cough mustbe conducted in patients with cough due to naturally occurring disease.The agency also notes that the results of the Packman study (Ref. 11) areinconsistent with previously reported results from the same investigatorunder similar conditions. In an earlier study, Packman et al. (Ref. 14)found that guaifenesin was no better than placebo in reducing cough, althoughit appeared to enhance the combination of dextromethorphan and phenylpropanolamine.In addition, a recent study by Kuhn et al. (Ref. 13) failed to show thatguaifenesin is effective in suppressing cough in patients with cough dueto natural disease. Kuhn's study suggests that artificial induction ofcough may not be an appropriate method for studying expectorants. The investigatorsstudied the efficacy of guaifenesin in reducing cough frequency in youngadults with acute upper respiratory disease of less than 48 hours durationwith cough. Evaluations were made by using an objective cough-countingsystem and a questionnaire. Guaifenesin and its syrup vehicle were administeredto 42 patients in this double-blind study for a 36-hour treatment period.A total of 2,400 mg (30 milliliters every 6 hours) of guaifenesin was administered.The protocol was similar to that suggested by the Panel (41 FR 38312 at38369). In essence, simultaneously recorded subjective responses determinedby questionnaire were compared with the cough counts obtained from a taperecording over a 60-hour period. Differences in sputum volume (a decreasein 88 percent in the treatment group and 62 percent in the placebo group)and decrease in viscosity (96 percent versus 54 percent in treatment andplacebo groups, respectively) were demonstrated in the questionnaires ofboth groups when compared with baseline. However, the cough tape showedno differences in median cough frequency between the groups. Moreover,the tape demonstrated a diurnal pattern, which was present both beforeand after treatment and which was not reflected in the subjective coughfrequency estimates obtained from the questionnaires.In conclusion, none of the studies dealing with naturally occurring coughare acceptable for a cough reduction claim for guaifenesin because noneof them used objective cough counting techniques (Refs. 2 through 6 and9). The Panel emphasized objective cough counting as a requirement forany claim for amelioration of cough (41 FR 38355 and 38369), and the agencyconcurs. Moreover, the agency does not consider induced-cough studies aloneas adequate to demonstrate a cough reduction claim. The agency's detailedcomments and evaluations on the data are on file in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) (Refs. 15 and 16).Based on the discussion above, the agency is not including in the expectorantfinal monograph a specific cough reduction (antitussive) claim for expectorants.However, submitted data demonstrate that guaifenesin loosens and thinssputum and bronchial secretions and makes expectoration easier. In thethe Vercelli study (see comment 5 above), over the first 4 to 6 days, patientswho received guaifenesin produced a greater increase in sputum volume thandid placebo patients. The mean percentage of total sputum volume expectoratedby day 7 was significantly greater for guaifenesin patients than for placebopatients (69.3 percent vs 53.7 percent, p andless;0.001). Sputum became lessviscous in patients who received guaifenesin. Expectoration of secretionsappeared to be easier in the guaifenesin-treated group than in the placebogroup. The agency concludes that the results of the Vercelli study demonstratethat quaifenesin facilitates expectoration of retained secretions by increasingsputum volume and making sputum less viscous. Terms such as ``productive'' and ``nonproductive'' cough are commonly usedin the labeling of OTC cough-cold drug products. A productive cough producesphlegm (sputum), while a nonproductive cough is dry and often irritative.The agency notes that the Cough-Cold Panel stated that expectorants areagents that are used to promote or facilitate the evacuation of secretionsfrom the bronchial airways to provide for the temporary relief of coughsdue to minor throat and bronchial irritation as may occur with upper respiratoryinfection. This may be accomplished by reducing the thickness of thesesecretions or by augmenting the formation of a more fluid secretion. Thesecretions (sputum or phlegm) expectorated consists in part of respiratorytract fluids together with a varying mixture of saliva and postnasal secretions(41 FR 38355).The Cough-Cold Panel also stated in its report that expectorants reducethe thickness of secretions or augment the formation of a more fluid secretion(41 FR 38355). By facilitating the evacuation of secretions from the bronchialairway, local irritants are removed. While such an effect may indirectlyserve to diminish the tendency to cough, the mechanism of this indirectaction is quite different from that of an antitussive which is specificallydesigned to inhibit or suppress cough. Any claim relating to the reductionof cough must be supported by objective cough counting studies. Expectorantswould be expected to have their major usefulness in the irritative nonproductivecough as well as those coughs productive of scanty amounts of thick, stickysecretions (41 FR 38355).Based on the above discussion, the agency believes that the phrase ``helpsloosen phlegm (sputum) and thin bronchial secretions to make coughs moreproductive'' is an appropriate alternative labeling statement. However,any labeling suggesting that an expectorant is a ``cough suppressant (antitussive),''``helps you cough less,'' ``helps relieve cough,'' ``helps ease cough''or is ``for cough'' or is a ``cough formula'' without the type of clarifyingstatements mentioned above would be inappropriate. Thus, because expectorantsloosen and thin sputum and bronchial secretions, and coughing enhancesthe removal of such secretions from the respiratory passageways, the agencyis revising the indications for expectorants in andSection; 341.78(b) asfollows: ``Helps loosen phlegm (sputum) and thin bronchial secretions to''(select one or more of the following: ``rid the bronchial passageways ofbothersome mucus,'' ``drain bronchial tubes,'' and ``make coughs more productive'').<ITAG tagnum="71">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00197, Docket No. 76N-052C, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Connell, W.

One comment requested that the labeling of guaifenesin as an OTC expectorantbe expanded to include labeling for health professionals (but not for thegeneral public) as follows: ``For the treatment of bronchitis, asthma,and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when these conditions are complicatedby thickened and/or impacted mucus.'' The comment stated that both theagency and the Cough-Cold Panel recommended that clinical trials to documentthe efficacy of guaifenesin be conducted in patients suffering from theseconditions. The comment further stated that guaifenesin has been demonstratedto increase sputum volume and decrease sputum viscosity, and these factorsenhance the expectoration of viscous bronchial secretions and thus aidin the treatment of these respiratory conditions. The comment (Ref. 1)submitted 25 references (Refs. 2 through 26) in support of its professionallabeling claim.The agency has reviewed the data submitted by the comment and concludesthat the proposed labeling indication is not substantiated for the reasonsdescribed below. However, based upon the Vercelli study that supportedthe reclassification of guaifenesin as an expectorant from Category IIIto Category I (Ref. 27), the agency concludes that the following professionallabeling claim, which is different from that proposed by the comment, isacceptable for guaifenesin: ``Helps loosen phlegm and thin bronchial secretionsin patients with stable chronic bronchitis.''Of the 25 references submitted by the comment, only 8 are concerned withthe efficacy of guaifenesin as a single ingredient (Refs. 2, 3, 6, 9, 17,21, 22, and 26), while 2 used a product containing an oral sympathomimeticingredient (1 mg desoxyephedrine hydrochloride) and guaifenesin (Refs.5 and 19). Most of these studies contain deficiencies which are sufficientlysignificant to preclude using the data in support of the comment's proposedprofessional labeling claim (Refs. 2, 3, 5, 17, 19, 21, and 22), whileseveral of these studies provide some subjective support for a professionallabeling claim (Refs. 6, 9, and 26). These latter three studies plus theVercelli study (Ref. 27) provide sufficient support for the agency's professionallabeling claim for guaifenesin noted above. The other 15 studies involvedcombination products, usually containing one bronchodilator, or a varietyof other drugs, so that the effect of guaifenesin could not be adequatelyaddressed (Refs. 4, 7, 8, 10 through 16, 18, 20, and 23 through 25).The agency has the following comments on the studies in which guaifenesinwas studied as a single ingredient: Ackerman (Ref. 2) studied the use ofantibiotics versus guaifenesin; however, he did not evaluate the expectorantor antitussive activity of guaifenesin. Blanchard et al. (Ref. 3) did aretrospective analysis of the investigators' subjective assessment of theefficacy of guaifenesin. Diagnostic criteria were not met; and there wasno random assignment, no comparability of groups, and no controls. Chodosh(Ref. 6) studied the efficacy and mechanism of action of guaifenesin inchronic bronchitic patients. Evaluations included clinical assessment,pulmonary function tests, and sputum cytology (physical and chemical properties).Chodosh reported that statistical analysis revealed ``general clinicalimprovement'' with guaifenesin compared to placebo and sputum was moreeasily raised above the improvement noted with water alone. Although objectivemeasures of test results were not provided, the study suggests that guaifenesinis efficacious in patients with bronchitis and that certain laboratorydeterminations can be correlated with clinical assessment of the drug.Hayes et al. (Ref. 9) subjectively evaluated the effectiveness of guaifenesinin reducing sputum tenaciousness in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis,bronchiectasis, or bronchitis, in a 2-phase study. A total of 150 observationswere made for the patients studied. The investigators reported that guaifenesinwas effective in loosening secretions in 80 percent of the 150 testingperiods in phase I and in 75 percent of the testing periods in phase II.The multi-center study by Robinson et al. (Ref. 17) evaluated guaifenesin'seffect on both productive and nonproductive cough and the expectorationof sputum. Ease of expectoration was studied in subjects with acute upperrespiratory infection (of 12 to 72 hours duration) with both ``dry'' and``productive'' coughs. The study indicated that, based on subjective assessment,guaifenesin facilitated raising of sputum in productive cough but not innon-productive cough. The results obtained for some of these subjects werepooled for analysis; other results were not. Statistical analysis was carriedout, but the subjects were classified each day as either improving, nochange, or worsening. With the number of variables involved, objectivemeasurement would appear essential for both cough and sputum parametersas noted by the Panel (41 FR 38369).Stevens et al. (Ref. 19) studied guaifenesin in animals and humans. Thedetails of the study are sparse, and the study appears uncontrolled. Also,the patient population used in the study (medical students with colds)is inappropriate for the proposed professional labeling claim. Thomsonet al. (Ref. 22) measured mucociliary clearance from the lung followingadministration of guaifenesin, but the clinical efficacy of the drug wasnot demonstrated. Wojcicki et al. (Ref. 26) evaluated four drug regimensin patients with chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, andchronic bronchitis with asthma. The drugs tested were (1) a combinationof narcotine (a non-narcotic antitussive) and guaifenesin, (2) narcotine,(3) guaifenesin, and (4) placebo. Ease of expectoration was subjectivelymeasured. The investigators reported that the two regimens with guaifenesin(1 and 3) appeared to facilitate expectoration in 75 percent of the subjects.The agency's more detailed comments and evaluation of these referencesare on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) (Ref. 28).The Vercelli study was conducted in patients with chronic bronchitis (Ref.27). The results demonstrated the effectiveness of guaifenesin in helpingto loosen and raise sputum. (See comment 5 above.) Based on this objectivestudy (Ref. 27) and the subjective studies which support the use of guaifenesinin helping to raise sputum (Refs. 6, 9, and 26), the agency believes thatthe comment's suggested labeling claim ``For the treatment of bronchitis,asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when these conditionsare complicated by thickened and/or impacted mucus'' should be revisedto read as follows: ``Help loosen phlegm and bronchial secretions in patientswith stable chronic bronchitis.'' The agency disagrees with the comments'specific suggested claim for the following reasons: (1) The effectivenessof guaifenesin in the symptomatic relief of sputum removal in asthmaticshas not been demonstrated. Moreover, in asthma, the narrowing of the bronchiand drying of secretions can result in inspissated material and mucus plugswhich further reduce the airway and produce difficult breathing. The appropriatetreatment for such a condition is hydration, bronchoscopy with lavage andsuctioning combined with anti-inflammatory drugs and bronchodilators. Withoutsuch an approach in the treatment of asthmatics, a safety concern exists.(2) The patient population in the Vercelli study consisted of persons withchronic bronchitis. Because no objective data were generated in a populationwith the other conditions mentioned by the comment, the agency is limitingthe professional labeling claim for guaifenesin to patients with chronicbronchitis.(3) The study population in the Vercelli study did not have conditionsthat would be characterized as ``complicated by thickened and/or impactedmucus.'' Sputum characteristics were based on a 4-point scale; a 4 wasassigned to a sputum sample which was pus-like, uniformly clumped, anddid not move down a glass microscope slide inclined at a 45anddegrees; angle.A value of 3 was assigned to a pus-like (clump-stringy) sample exhibitingvery slow movement. Thickened and/or impacted mucus denotes sputum whichis firmly lodged or wedged. The category which would be comparable to thickenedand/or impacted would be a 4. The sputum of no patients in either testgroup was assigned a 4, but more than half of all patients had sputum characterizedas a 3. Additionally, the term ``complicated'' means associated with otherdiseases, which in reference to the bronchi usually means infection. Infectionswould be treated with antibiotics. The Vercelli study did not include patientswho required the use of antibiotics. Thus, the comment's suggested termsare not in keeping with the patient population that was studied and arenot appropriate for a professional labeling claim. The use of the term``stable'' in the revised claim eliminates the acute brochitic and thechronic bronchitic patients whose disease may be complicated.Therefore, the agency is including the indication ``Helps loosen phlegmand thin bronchial secretions in patients with stable chronic bronchitis''as a professional labeling claim for guaifenesin in andSection; 341.90(d).This professional labeling claim is only permitted for single ingredientsexpectorant drug products because no data have been presented to supportthe use of expectorant combination drug products, e.g., an expectorantand an antitussive, in the chronic bronchitic patient population.<ITAG tagnum="20">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00196, Docket No. 76N-052C, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG

One comment stated that the study on which the agency based the reclassificationof guaifenesin as an expectorant from Category III to Category I was seriouslyflawed and thus does not justify the claim that this drug is effectiveas an expectorant (Ref. 1). The comment maintained that the study containedthe following flaws: (1) The qualifications of the investigator were not included in the datethat were received and reviewed by the comment. (2) The study involved 40 patients with chronic bronchitis who were hospitalizedin a pulmonary hospital in Italy. It is unclear whether randomization wasadequate in this small group of patients and whether blinding was maintainedin view of guaifenesin's distinctive taste. (3) The study did not use patients similar to the majority of those forwhom the drug will be used. The study involved hospitalized patients inItaly with chronic bronchitis, whereas guaifenesin is used in the UnitedStates almost exclusively for self-treatment of colds or acute bronchitis.(4) There were a number of other serious design flaws. For example, thepatients received numerous drugs in addition to guaifenesin, includingbronchodilators (36 patients), cough suppressants (11 patients), antihistamines(3 patients), antianxiety agents (3 patients), and diuretics. How muchof these medications the patients received and whether their use was similarin control and treatment groups were not stated in the study. These drugscould have a substantial effect on sputum volume, viscosity, and coughseverity. Other factors that can affect cough and sputum, such as smokinghabits and fluid intake, were not measured. (5) The two groups of 20 patients each (control and treatment) were differenteven before the drug (or placebo) was given. The group of patients designatedto be treated with guaifenesin had a statistically significant greaterseverity (frequency) of cough and increased difficulty in coughing comparedwith the placebo group. (6) Other differences between the guaifenesin and placebo groups cast furtherdoubts on how well the 40 patients were randomized. Four patients in theguaifenesin group, but none in the placebo group, had complete disappearanceof their cough by day 13. This condition continued through day 15. If thesefour patients all had chronic bronchitis, complete disappearance of coughwould be an unusual finding. (7) The study made little use of objective methods. The only ``objective''measurements used were sputum volume (which could be changed dramaticallyby the presence of saliva) and a subjective judgment of the viscosity ofsputum based on how it looked on slide. A much more objective method, usinga viscosimeter, has been described by Hirsch et al. (Ref. 2) who foundguaifenesin was ineffective as an expectorant in patients with chronicbronchitis. Viscosity was not improved with the drug when measured withthe viscosimeter. (8) Many if the improvements that may be attributable to quaifenesin weremainly subjective and did not begin until after 8 to 10 days of treatment.Such benefits would not be very useful to persons with short-term respiratoryinfections (such as colds) who desire quick relief. The agency's evaluation of the study referred to by the comment is discussedin comment 5 above. The FDA supports the Category I classification of guaifenesinas an expectorant and has the following responses to the comment's criticismsof the study: (1) The qualifications of the investigators are included in the guaifenesinsubmission (Ref. 3). When the study was submitted, the agency reviewedthe curriculum vitae of the investigators and found the investigators qualified.(2) According to the protocol, patients were assigned under double-blindconditions by use of a randomization schedule, which resulted in a well-balanceddistribution of patients for age, sex, sputum volume, and sputum viscosity.The guaifenesin group tended to have more severe symptoms than the placebogroup with respect to cough and difficulty of expectoration. A randomizationschedule is included in the statistical report section of the submission.The agency believes that the baseline characteristics were comparable forthe two groups. With regard to the comment's concern that the study wasnot blinded due to guaifenesin's distinctive taste, the agency believesthat it is not always possible to duplicate the distinct characteristicsof a test drug without introducing the possibility of another variableto the test system. Although the placebo may not have had the same bitteraftertaste as guaifenesin, the placebo and treatment regimens both containedthe syrup vehicle, but the placebo did not contain guaifenesin. Thus, theagency believes that the study was adequately blinded and controlled. (3) Expectorants are indicated for the loosening of phlegm and bronchialsecretions. The Panel suggested that to evaluate expectorants either patientswith chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, or inactive pulmonary tuberculosiswhose condition is relatively stable with no evidence of intercurrent infectionthat would affect cough or the character of the sputum, or patients withan acute upper respiratory infection, such as acute bronchitis with a drynonproductive cough, could be used (41 FR 38369). The agency believes that although either patient population recommendedby the Panel can be used to evaluate expectorants, in order to accuratelyrecord the effect of these drugs on sputum production and viscosity, itmay be more prudent to choose a population with chronic or stable symptoms(such as the chronic bronchitics chosen for this study) rather than a populationwith short-term symptoms (such as patients with acute upper respiratoryinfections). Hospitalization of the patients in the study was desirablebecause it ensured compliance to the protocol, enabled the investigatorsto maintain a controlled environment, and facilitated the recording ofobjective measurements. (4) The comment criticized the use of concomitant drug therapy in the study.Many patients with chronic cough secondary to chronic bronchitis and otherdiseases may require occasional therapy for their comfort. To discontinuetotally such therapy for a 2-week study period may be inappropriate orunethical. The submitted case histories document that cough suppressants,antihistamines, antianxiety drugs, and bronchodilators were used. However,the clinical report states that the use of these medications was minimal,occurring only once or twice per patient during the study. The use of thesedrugs was equally distributed between placebo and guaifenesin groups, i.e.,5 placebo patients and 6 guaifenesin patients received an antitussive;1 placebo patient and 2 guaifenesin patients received an antianxiety drug,and 20 placebo patients and 16 guaifenesin patients received a bronchodilator.Fluid intake was permitted with no restrictions unless medical reasonsprohibited it. Smoking habits were not mentioned in the study. The agencynotes that the use of bronchodilators (the medication used most frequently)and antitussives would more likely have an effect on cough reduction ratherthan expectoration. Because a cough reduction claim for expectorants hasnot been demonstrated by objective measures and, therefore, is not permitted,the effect of these drugs on the study results is considered negligible.(See comment 6 above.) (5) The comment contended that treatment and placebo groups were differentinitially. Patients with chronic bronchitis were selected, but were requiredto have additional entrance criteria, i.e., must have had normal temperatureand did not require the use of antibiotics or steroids. A 3-day washoutperiod before baseline sputum values were recorded was required. The useof antitussives, mucolytics, and anticholinergics was prohibited. In subjectswho required concomitant drugs, the use of these drugs was recorded ona one-time basis. Subjective evaluations based on a 4-point scale (a rating of 0 to 3) wereused to assess the frequency of cough and difficulty in raising sputum.Baseline values for all subjects in both placebo and treatment groups werea rating of either 2 or 3 for both study variables. Because a cough reductionclaim for expectorants is not permitted, the comment's objection that theguaifenesin group's frequency of cough and difficulty in coughing was moresevere than the placebo group appears moot. There is no objective methodfor assessing the difficulty of expectoration, but the differences betweenmoderate effort (a rating of 2) and marked effort (a rating of 3) appearto be almost negligible. More importantly, placebo and treatment groupswere not different at baseline in the other parameters of volume and viscosity,and it is with these two characteristics that differences in results werein fact recorded. (6) Disappearance of cough in four patients in the guaifenesin group wasa recorded result noted after the study had been in progress. The agencydoes not consider this occurrence a randomization problem. Although itmay be true that it is unusual for a cough to disappear totally in patientswith chronic bronchitis, it is not unusual for a cough to disappear fora day or two as recorded in the study (days 13 to 15). The American ThoracicSociety's definition of chronic bronchitis notes the presence of a productivecough daily for at least 3 months of the year (Ref. 4). Moreover, as notedin the agency's statistical evaluation of the study, the four guaifenesinpatients with no cough symptoms by the 13th or 14th day had no efficacyvariables recorded thereafter. In all analyses, the sponsor replaced thesemissing values by the last available patient observation. This is a conservativeapproach in that true values for these patients (later during treatment)would probably show a higher degree of improvement than their last evaluation,and results are not substantially changed if these patients are excludedfrom the analysis. Finally, the relationship of cough and lung mucociliaryclearance has been reported to be complementary (Ref. 5). Cough appearsto be initiated when mucociliary clearance is ineffective. Guaifenesinhas been shown to improve mucociliary clearance and to increase the outputof respiratory tract fluid. Therefore, it is possible, although not proven,that, due to improvement in mucociliary clearance, cough decreased or disappearedtransiently because it was not needed. (7) The criticism that the study makes little use of objective methodsis valid to a degree; however, because of the difficulty in evaluatingthe effectiveness of expectorants, both objective and subjective evaluationsare used. The variables that were evaluated in the study included sputumvolume, sputum characteristics, difficulty of expectoration, and coughseverity. Daily sputum volume was objectively measured, a 24-hour collectionmeasured in milliliters was recorded. Sputum characteristics were measuredusing a 4-point scale that described sputum characteristics and rapidityof flow down a microscope slide tilted at a 45-degree angle. Although thismeasurement cannot be recorded in terms such as those used to express measurementsfrom a viscosimeter (e.g., pounds per square inch), it is objective. Valueswere assigned as follows: 4 (pus-like, uniformly clumped and no movementdown the slide); 3 (clump-stringy with very slow movement); 2 (dense, stringy,and slow movement down the slide); and 1 (clear and flowed quickly). Additionally,as discussed at a workshop on lung mucociliary clearance, there is a largerange of mucus viscosity that is recorded during adequate mucociliary transport,but a narrow range for elasticity. How these two characteristics influenceexpectoration is unclear, but elasticity appears more important than viscosity(Ref. 5). There are no objective methods for measuring the difficulty of expectoration;therefore, subjective evaluations must be relied upon. A 4-point scalewas also used to assess difficulty of expectoration. The values assignedwere: 0 (no difficulty); 1 (with slight effort); 2 (with moderate effort);and 3 (with great effort). For cough severity, objective methods can be used (i.e., cough counting);however, the study did not use objective methods but simply used a 4-pointscale of 0 (absence of symptoms); 1 (intermittent, sporadic cough); 2 (manycoughing spells throughout the day); and 3 (continuous coughing). The Panelreviewed the Hirsch study (Ref. 2), referred to by the comment, in whicha viscosimeter was used (41 FR 38362). However, the Panel did not recommendthat this type of instrument be used to evaluate expectorants.(8) With respect to the time required for the action of guaifenesin tobe documented and whether such benefits would be useful for persons withshort-term respiratory symptoms who desire quick relief, the data showedthat over the first 4 to 6 days the sputum volume increased in guaifenesinpatients and then decreased. The mean percentage of total sputum volumeexpectorated by day 7 was significantly greater on guaifenesin than onplacebo (69.3 percent vs. 53.7 percent, pandgreater;0.001) and the mean numberof days to expectoration of 75 percent of the total sputum volume was significantlylower on guaifenesin than on placebo (8.40 vs. 10.65 days, pandgreater;0.001).The change in sputum characteristics was accompanied by improvement insubjective measures of raising sputum and of cough severity.A recent study by Kuhn et al. (Ref. 6) on the effectiveness of guaifenesinon the symptoms of the common cold demonstrated no antitussive effect,but recorded improvement in the treatment group over placebo with respectto changes in sputum, i.e., an increase in volume and ease of expectoration.As set forth in this document, OTC labeling for expectorants does not referto specific disease entities, but rather that the product is to be usedto loosen phlegm (sputum) and thin bronchial secretions. However, the agencyis including a professional labeling claim for guaifenesin in this documentthat allows the use of the drug in individuals with stable chronic bronchitis.(See comment 7 above.) In addition, the Panel noted a study by Thomsonet al. (41 FR 38363) that reported that, in bornchitic patients, inhaledradioactive particles were removed more rapidly and within 5 hours afteradministering guaifenesin than after administering the placebo. This studysuggests that the therapeutic action of guaifenesin may occur shortly afteradministration, but that the effect of the drug on sputum volume requireslonger to record objectively.The agency does not find the guaifenesin study seriously flawed as claimedby the comment. The agency acknowledges that there are conflicting reportsin the literature regarding guaifenesin's effectiveness as an expectorant,and much of the controversy deals with determining suitable objective testmethods for evaluating expectorants. The Panel recognized the value ofusing both subjective and objective methodology and recommended that onlyone additional subjective study be done. The subjective study could alsouse objective methods, such as sputum volume, sputum viscosity, and characterand color of sputum (41 FR 38369).The agency determined that objective measures of sputum volume and viscositycorrelated with subjective evaluations should be performed to establishedthe effectiveness of guaifenesin as an expectorant. The guaifenesin studyhas fulfilled these requirements, and, on this basis, guaifenesin has beenupgraded to monograph status.<ITAG tagnum="81">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment No. C00199, Docket No. 76-052C, Dockets Management Branch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Hirsch, S.

One comment maintained that, although the Panel was unable to make adetermination that ipecac is effective, ipecac as an emetic agent would,in theory, have marked expectorant action. The comment stated that theexpectorant action of ipecac has been demonstrated in animals and, becausetechniques for evaluating the effectiveness of expectorants in humans arestill unsatisfactory, extrapolations from animal studies which correlatewith pharmacologic theory should be acceptable. If clinical judgement supportsthese extrapolations, the comment contended that ipecac and other expectorantscan be considered as potentially effective provided they are used in theappropriate dosage, which may be greater then the conventional dosage.The agency recognizes that some animal studies show that ipecac can increasethe flow of respiratory tract fluid (41 FR 38364). However, human studiesreviewed by the Panel did not demonstrate ipecac's effectiveness as anexpectorant. Although animal studies are very useful in the preliminarystages of drug development to indicate a drug's possible effect in humans,animal studies alone cannot be used to support the effectiveness of a drugin humans. Clinical trials conducted in the target population are neededto assess a drug's effect in humans. The comment submitted no new datato support the effectiveness of ipecac as an expectorant. Ipecac and othernonmonograph expectorant ingredients can be tested in humans to determinewhether conventional doses or even larger doses are effective. If largerthan recommended doses are not within a known safety range, additionalsafety studies will be needed. The agency notes that two studies in humanson ipecac (at a dose corresponding to 0.82 mg of total alkaloids of ipecac)have been submitted to the agency and are presently under review. (Seecomment 10 below.) 10. Two comments disagreed with the agency's tentative conclusion at 47FR 30007 that the effectiveness of ipecac as an expectorant has not beenestablished. One of the comments stated that its combination liquid drugproduct, which contains ipecac as well as other ingredients, has been soldfor more than 62 years as a ``natural'' ingredient OTC cough medicine.Two clinical studies that were previously submitted to the agency and hundredsof physician's confidential patient reports have attested to the efficacyof the product, the comment maintained. The comment added that if its smallcompany is required to change the formula of the product, the company wouldlose its marketing franchise. The product would then become just another``me too'' product with no formula or performance individuality to distinguishit or to help offset a huge, competitive market.The confidential patient reports, isolated case reports, random experience,and reports lacking details that permit scientific evaluation cannot beregarded as proof of effectiveness, but must be corroborated by clinicalstudies. The two studies mentioned by one of the comments were discussedin the tentative final monograph (47 FR 30007). The studies were conductedusing a combination product containing ipecac, beechwood creosote, cascara,menthol, white pine, wild cherry, and alcohol. The agency concluded thatbecause the ingredients of the combination drug product were not studiedindividually, it was impossible for the agency to ascertain which ingredientsin the product were responsible for any of the effects obtained. Additionally,the studies did not include any objective measurements of sputum volumeand sputum viscosity. The agency considers these measurements necessaryto establish the effectiveness of an expectorant ingredient.After the comments were submitted, and while the administrative recordwas open, the agency approved a proposed protocol for studying ipecac thathad been submitted by one of the comments (Refs. 1, 2, and 3). On January6, 1987, after the administrative record had closed, a citizen petitionwas filed with the agency submitting two studies on the effectiveness ofipecac as an expectorant (Ref. 4). The studies are presently under review.Therefore, at this time, ipecac is not included in the final monographfor OTC expectorant drug products. However, if the submitted new data establishthe effectiveness of ipecac as an expectorant, procedures to amend themonograph will be initiated under 21 CFR 330.10(a)(12). Regulatory policyfor products containing nonmonograph ingredients is set forth in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 13, 1980 (see 45 FR 31424 to 31425).Concerning the economic effects of reformulation cited by the comment,the agency published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), announcingthe availability of an assessment of the economic impacts of the agencyconcluded that the OTC drug review. In that assessment, the agency concludedthat the OTC drug review was not a major rule as defined in Executive Order12291, but recognized that significantly large impacts might be experiencedby some small firms in some years. FDA has a statutory mandate to assurethat OTC drug products are safe and effective for their intended use andare properly labeled. The statute does not allow FDA to waive these importantpublic health considerations merely because a product's formula individualitymay be lost or because additional costs may be incurred by a manufacturerin order to achieve compliance with a monograph.<ITAG tagnum="81">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Comment Nos.

One comment stated that it is not clear why ipecac syrup should belimited to children 6 years of age and over and that apparently there isno suggestion that it is more dangerous in children under 6 and over 2.As dicussed in the tentative final monograph (47 FR 30007), the agencybased its evaluation of the use of ipecac syrup in children on the recommendationof a committee of experts in pediatric drug therapy who served as advisorsto the Panel in determining pediatric dosages for OTC cough-cold drug ingredients.These experts reviewed the available data and recommended that ipecac syrup,as an OTC expectorant, be used only in children 6 years of age and over.The Panel also reviewed the available data and noted that there were noclinical studies substantiating the effectiveness of ipecac syrup as anexpectorant and no data on the toxicity of ipecac syrup as a single ingredientfor expectorant use in children under 6 years of age. Because of this lackof data, the Panel placed ipecac syrup as an expectorant in Category IIIfor effectiveness and adopted the pediatric committee's recommendationthat ipecac syrup not be given to children under 6 years of age exceptas directed by a doctor.The comment provided no new information that would lead the agency to alterthe Panel's recommendations or its conclusions in the tentative final monographregarding the OTC use of ipecac syrup in children under 6 years of age.Therefore, ipecac syrup is not included in this final monograph.C. Comments on OTC Expectorant Labeling12. One comment noted its continuing position that FDA cannot legally andshould not, as a matter of policy, prescribe exclusive lists of terms fromwhich indications for use for OTC drugs must be drawn, thereby prohibitingalternative OTC drug labeling terminology that is truthful, not misleading,and intelligible to the consumer. The comment added that these views werepresented to FDA in oral and written testimony in connection with the September29, 1982 agency hearing on the exclusivity policy.The comment added that these labeling restrictions prevent the use of wordsthat have been widely understood and commonly used for generations on OTCmedications. The comment stated that the industry has long encouraged anagency policy that would allow choice in labeling nonprescription medicinesfor consumer use and urged the Commissioner to avoid restricting alternativelabeling not only in this monograph but also in future proposed rulemakings.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency publisheda final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications foruse of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labelingof OTC drug products are required to contain in a prominent and conspicuouslocation, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use establishedunder an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing such indications for usethat meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling,which shall neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVEDUSES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on indications, which mayappear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternativelanguage describing indications for use that is not false or misleading,which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug labelingrequired by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity,warnings, and directions) must appear in the specific wording establishedunder the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language hasbeen established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63or 330.1(g). The final rule in this document is subject to the labelingprovisions in andSection; 330.1(c)(2).13. One comment objected to the agency's limiting the statement of identityof expectorant drug products to only one term, i.e., ``expectorant.'' Thecomment urged FDA to allow manufacturers alternative ways of expressingthe statement of identity in accord with 21 CFR 201.61, which allows thestatement of identity to include an accurate statement of the general pharmacologicalcategory(ies) of the drug or the principal intended actions(s) of the drug.The comment stated that by using the principal intended actions to describethese products instead of using only their pharmacologic categories, anexpectorant could be described as a product ``for the loosening of phlegm.''The comment added that such a description would have more meaning to laymenand should not be prohibited.Wherever possible, the agency prefers to use the general pharmacologiccategory as the statement of identity because information on the principalintended action of the product is provided in the indications section.However, in instances where the pharmacologic category is not appropriateas the statement of identity, the principal intended action is used. Forexample, the statement of identity for an antihistamine used as a nighttimesleep-aid is ``nighttime sleep-aid.''The alternative statement of identity suggested by the comment for expectorantdrug products is similar to the indications statements that were proposedfor these drugs in andSection;341.78(b) of the tentative final monograph(47 FR 30009). The agency sees no need to include in the statement of identityfor expectorants the same information found in the indications section.However, because the phrase is descriptive of the action of expectorantdrug products, it or similar phrases may appear elsewhere in the labelingof an OTC expectorant drug product (but may not appear in any portion ofthe labeling required by the monograph and may not detract from such requiredinformation) provided they meet the provisions of section 502 of the act(21 U.S.C. 352) relating to misbranding. Therefore, the comment's suggestionis not being included in this final monograph.14. One comment referred to the following warning for expectorants in proposedandSection;341.78(c)(2): ``Do not take this product for persistent or chroniccough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, or emphysema, or where coughis accompanied by excessive secretions unless directed by a doctor.'' Thecomment stated that the words ``or where cough is accompanied by excessivesecretions unless directed by a doctor'' are ``surplus'' and are not needed.The comment did not provide any data to support its contention that thelast portion of the warning is not needed. The agency believes that thewords which the comment considers as ``surplus'' are necessary in the warningstatement because these words reinforce the importance of consulting aphysician in cases of coughs where a serious disease condition may be present.As the Panel noted, expectorants are used * * * to provide for the temporaryrelief of coughs due to minor throat and bronchial irritation as may occurwith upper respiratory infection (41 FR 38355). The agency notes that acough frequently accompanies both minor upper respiratory infections andmore serious respiratory infections. In minor upper respiratory conditionsin which cough is nonproductive or is accompanied by scanty, thick secretions,and lasts for no more than a week, an expectorant can be used by the self-medicatingconsumer to make the cough more productive by loosening and thinning thebronchial secretions and phlegm. Accordingly, the agency is allowing thefollowing claim for expectorants: ``Helps loosen phlegm (sputum) and thinbronchial secretions to'' (select one or more of the following: ``rid thebronchial passageways of bothersome mucus,'' ``drain bronchial tubes,''and ``make coughs more productive''). (See comment 6 above.)The agency is aware that a chronic cough or cough accompanied by excessivesecretions may be indicative of a more serious respiratory disease forwhich a physician should be consulted. Therefore, the warning proposedin andSection; 341.78(c)(2) (redesignated as andSection; 341.78(c)(1) in thisdocument) is being included in this final monograph without the changesuggested by the comment. In addition, the agency believes that the term``chronic bronchitis'' should also be included in the warning. Patientswith chronic bronchitis who have a persistent cough or excessive secretionsshould seek the advice of a physician before using an expectorant. Additionally,to make the warning clearer to consumers, the agency is substituting thephrase ``phlegm (sputum)'' for ``secretions.'' Therefore, the agency isrevising the warning to read as follows: ``Do not take this product forpersistent or chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronicbronchitis, or emphysema, or where cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm(sputum) unless directed by a doctor.''15. Three comments disagreed with the agency's proposed substitution ofthe word ``doctor'' for ``physician'' in OTC drug labeling. One commentstated that because ``physician'' is a term that is recognized by peopleof all ages and social and economic levels, there is no need for the change,which would be costly and provide no benefit. The comment further contendedthat physician is a more accurate term, whereas ``doctor'' is a broad termthat could confuse and mislead the lay person into taking advice on medicationfrom persons other than medical doctors, such as optometrists, podiatrists,and chiropractors. The other two comments added that the term ``physician''is clearly defined as a person licensed to practice medicine, whereas theterm ``doctor'' is ambiguous and much more general. One of these commentsrecommended that FDA not eliminate ``physician,'' the more specific term,but allow the option of using either term.In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in a numberof tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor'' for ``physician''in OTC drug monographs on the basis that the word ``doctor'' is more commonlyused and better understood by consumers. Based on comments received tothese proposals, the agency has determined that final monographs and anyapplicable OTC drug regulation will give manufacturers the option of usingeither the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This final monographprovides that option.16. One comment objected to elimination of the term ``Caution(s)'' in thelabeling of OTC drug products. The comment claimed that a warning precludesuse under certain conditions, whereas ``caution'' does not preclude use,but may often alert the consumer to a potential problem, e.g., ``Caution:If irritation develops discontinue use and consult a physician.'' Thus,the word ``warning'' is harsher than ``caution.'' The comment stated thata caution may also be used to add emphasis, e.g., ``Caution: Use only asdirected,'' or to alert the user to a special need regarding the care ofa product, e.g., ``Caution: Keep out of direct sunlight;'' ``Store in refrigerator;''``Replace bottle cap.''The comment argued that it would undoubtedly dilute the impact of essentialwarning statements if ``cautions,'' which require the consumer to takecertain precautions while using the product, were intermingled with ``warnings,''which signal that the product should not be used at all under specifiedcircumstances. Although both types of statements are usually used to callattention to danger, the distinction is important, particularly when productscontain long lists of warnings. The comment added that because the samephrases may be warnings with regard to one class of products and merelycautions with regard to another, the flexibility of both terms is essentialin order to prepare accurate and comprehensible labeling.Section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.352(f)(2)) states, in part, that any drug marketed OTC must bear in labeling``* * * such adequate warnings * * * as are necessary for the protectionof users * * *.'' Section 330.10(a)(4)(v) of the OTC drug regulations providesthat labeling of OTC drug products should include ``* * * warnings againstunsafe use, side effects, and adverse reactions * * *.''The agency notes that historically there has not been consistent usageof the signal words ``warning'' and ``caution'' in OTC drug labeling. Forexample, in andSection;andSection; 369.20 and 369.21 (21 CFR 369.20 and 369.21),which list ``warning'' and ``caution'' statements for drugs, the signalwords ``warning'' and ``caution'' are both used. In some instances, eitherof these signal words is used to convey the same or similar precautionaryinformation.FDA has considered which of these signal words would be most likely toattract consumers' attention to that information describing conditionsunder which the drug product should not be used or its use should be discontinued.The agency concludes that the signal word ``warning'' is more likely toflag potential dangers so that consumers will read the information beingconveyed. Therefore, FDA has determined that the signal word ``warning,''rather than the word ``caution,'' will be used routinely in OTC drug labelingthat is intended to alert consumers to potential safety problems.D. Comments on Testing17. One comment stated that because there is a striking lack of data regardingthe use of expectorant drugs in children, it is important to have researchconducted to clarify the role of these agents in the care of children.The agency agrees with the comment that there is a lack of data regardingthe use of expectorant drugs in children. Because of this lack of data,the Panel consulted a committee of experts on pediatric drug therapy inorder to determine pediatric dosages for OTC cough-cold drug ingredients.The Panel and the pediatric committee recommended that pediatric dosagesbased on age be allowed for those OTC drugs that had a wide margin of safetyand for which adequate effectiveness data were available.The Panel reviewed one study on the effectiveness of guaifenesin as anantitussive in 76 infants and children, 2 months to 16.5 years of age (Ref.1). The investigators reported no disagreeable side effects, such as nausea,vomiting, and loss of appetite, and concluded that the efficacy of thisguaifenesin product in the treatment of cough in children can be attributedto its ``expectorant, demulcent, and general antitussive qualities resultingfrom an increased respiratory tract fluid.'' The agency concurs that researchon other expectorants should be conducted to clarify the role of theseingredients in the care of children.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Blanchard, K., and R.A. Ford, ``Effective Antitussive Agent inthe Treatment of Cough in Childhood,'' <T3>The Journal-Lancet, </T3>74:443-446, 1954.</ITAG>18. One comment disagreed with the agency's changes in the Panel's recommendedtesting requirements for expectorant drugs. The comment stated that thePanel had concluded that because there were no suitable objective methodsat that time for evaluating expectorants, the subjective evaluation ofthe patient must be relied upon for the assessment of the drug's expectorantactivity (41 FR 38369). The comment added, however, that in the tentativefinal monograph, the agency stated, with respect to guaifenesin, that althoughthe Panel required only subjective tests for determining the effectivenessof expectorants, the agency believed that objective measurements of sputumvolume and sputum viscosity should be done (47 FR 30005). The comment maintainedthat although there may be objective methodology to measure guaifenesin'sexpectorant activity, guaifenesin may or may not be truly representativeof expectorant drugs as a class. Therefore, objective methodology to assessother expectorants has not yet been established. Furthermore, differentexpectorants may produce different effects by which their therapeutic benefitsare achieved. Therefore, different objective and subjective criteria maybe needed to assess their efficacy. The comment concluded that to be consistentwith the Panel's recommendations, the emphasis in studying expectorantsshould be on clinical benefits, such as relief of discomfort, breathingcomfort, and ease of expectoration, all primarily subjective parameters.If objective criteria are feasible and appropriate, they can be added tothe subjective criteria, the comment added. In changing the requirements for testing expectorant drugs, the agencywas aware that the Panel stated that there were no suitable objective measuresfor evaluating the ease in raising secretions when testing expectorants,but that the Panel also stated that ``additional help in evaluating effectivenessmay be provided by some objective indices such as: the volume and dry weightof sputum collection over a given time (12 to 24 hours); the characterand color of the sputum raised; and some measure of its flow properties,such as viscosity of consistency'' (41 FR 38369). The Panel recognizedthat these objective indices would be useful in evaluating the efficacyof expectorants. The agency is requiring objective measurements of sputumvolume and viscosity because it believes that if an expectorant works thereshould be a measurable objective change in sputum volume and sputum viscosity.The objective sputum volume and viscosity tests that were used in the studyto support the efficacy of guaifenesin were feasible and appropriate. Thevolume of sputum collected over a 24-hour period was measured daily, andthe sputum viscosity was measured by using a 4-point scale that describedsputum characteristics and rapidity of flow down a microscope slide tiltedat a 45-degree angle. The study demonstrated the efficacy of guaifenesinand showed that subjective improvement could be correlated with objectivemeasures of expectorant action, i.e., an increase in volume and a decreasein viscosity of sputum. (See comment 5 above.)With regard to the comment's statement that objective methodology to measurethe effectiveness of other expectorant ingredients has not been established,the agency acknowledges that because of the potentially different mechanismsof action of expectorants, it can be expected that there may be differentobjective and subjective criteria that might be used to demonstrate theefficacy of expectorants. However, regardless of the mechanisms of action,expectorants as a class should help to remove secretions from the respiratoryairways by reducing the viscosity of secretions or by increasing the volume,thus making the secretions more fluid. For this reason, the agency believesthat the objective measures used in testing guaifenesin should also beused in testing the efficacy of other expectorants. The methods for studying guaifenesin, which were found acceptable by theagency, do not preclude a manufacturer's proposing other reasonable objectiveand subjective methods for studying expectorants. The agency will meetwith industry officials at their request to discuss testing protocols forany ingredient or condition that industry wishes to upgrade to monographstatus. (See the OTC Drug Review Policy statement, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 29, 1981; 46 FR 47740 and clarifiedApril 1, 1983; 48 FR 14050.) 19. One comment objected to the shortening of the time period for testingexpectorants from 5 years after publication of the final monograph, asrecommended by the Panel, to 12 months after publication of the tentativefinal monograph, as stated by FDA in the tentative final monograph. Thecomment stated that this time reduction would pose a hardship on smallcompanies, particularly because an acceptable protocol for determiningthe effectiveness of expectorants has not been established, the requirementsfor testing have been expanded, and because a small company cannot affordthe immense costs involved in developing experimental methodology. Thecomment stated that a 5-year period after publication of the final monographwould enable a small company to draw on the experience and expertise oflarger companies, which are better able to develop suitable protocols andmethodology. Thus a small company could focus its attention and limitedresources on the additional clinical trials needed to demonstrate efficacyof its products. As stated in the tentative final monograph for OTC anticholinergic drugproducts and expectorant drug products (47 FR 30002), in <T3>Cutler </T3>v. <T3>Kennedy</T3>, 475 F. Supp. 838 (D.D.C. 1979), the court ruled thatthe marketing of Category III drugs after publication of a final monographis illegal. Consequently, the agency deleted the provision of the OTC drugprocedural regulations that had allowed the OTC marketing of a CategoryIII drug after a final monograph had been established. Thus, the time allowedfor the concurrent marketing and testing of Category III expectorants wasreduced from 5 years after publication of the final monograph to 12 monthsafter publication of the tentative final monograph. The agency does not believe that this time reduction is unreasonable. Manufacturershave been aware of the Category III classification of expectorants sincethe Panel's report was published in September 1976, and have had ampleopportunity to discuss testing protocols with the agency and to conductclinical trials. The agency has emphasized that each manufacturer of aproduct with a Category III condition need not undertake the necessarytesting. Manufacturers have been encouraged to work with other manufacturersand with trade associations in developing protocols and arranging for thenecessary studies to establish Category I status. Regarding the comment's concern that a small company faces an additionalburden in trying to develop an acceptable protocol for testing expectorants,an acceptable protocol has now been developed for one expectorant, guaifenesin,and this ingredient has been reclassified to Category I. (See comment 5above.) The guaifenesin protocol that was developed and approved containsthe same principles that the Panel had recommended (41 FR 38369); thus,developing suitable protocols does not necessarily entail immense costor highly technical procedures. The agency also emphasizes that publicationof a final monograph does not preclude a manufacturer's testing an ingredient.After a final monograph has been published, any interested person can petitionthe Commissioner to amend the monograph to include a particular ingredientor condition. (See 21 CFR 10.30 and 330.10(a)(12).) <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Significant Changes From the Proposed Rule </ITAG>1. Guaifenesin has been reclassified from Category III to Category I andis included in this final monograph as an OTC expectorant. The agency concludesthat the Vercelli study (see comment 5 above) demonstrates that guaifenesin,by increasing sputum volume and making sputum less viscous, facilitatesexpectoration of retained secretions. Because expectorants loosen and thinsputum and bronchial secretions, and coughing enhances the removal of suchsecretions from the respiratory passageways, the agency is revising theindications for expectorants in andSection; 341.78(b) as follows: ``Helpsloosen phlegm (sputum) and thin bronchial secretions to'' (select one ormore of the following: ``rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus,''``drain bronchial tubes,'' and ``make coughs more productive''). (See comments5 and 6 above.)2. Both the Cough-Cold Panel and the Oral Cavity Panel reviewed data onthe safety and effectiveness of ingredients used as expectorants in OTCdrug products. The Oral Cavity Panel, in its report on OTC oral healthcare drug products published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 25, 1982 (47 FR 22760), classified potassiumiodide in Category II, and ammonium chloride, tolu balsam, and horehoundin Category III as expectorants. The Cough-Cold Panel reviewed twenty expectorants,including the expectorants reviewed by the Oral Cavity Panel, except forhorehound.Following publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking forOTC oral health care drug products, the agency received no data or commentsin support of the effectiveness of any expectorant for oral health careuse. Because the Cough-Cold Panel did an extensive review of expectorantingredients and no data to support safety and/or effectiveness have beensubmitted, the agency concludes in this final rule that the expectorantsthat were considered by the Oral Cavity Panel, i.e., potassium iodide,ammonium chloride, tolu balsam, and horehound, are nonmongraph ingredients.3. The agency has included the phrase ``taken orally'' in the definitionof expectorant in andSection; 341.3. (See comment 3 above.)4. The agency has reviewed the labeling proposed in the tentative finalmonograph and has concluded that the indication proposed in andSection; 341.78(b)(2),``Relieves irritated membranes in the respiratory passageways by preventingdryness through increased mucus flow'' is not supported by the data submitted.The Panel proposed this claim as a Category I labeling indication for expectorants(41 FR 38355) and it was also included in the tentative final monograph(47 FR 30009). However, because of a lack of efficacy data at that time,no expectorant ingredients were classified in Category I by the Panel inits report or by the agency in the tentative final monograph.The agency has reevaluated the Panel's report and the data on expectorantsthat were submitted to the Panel (41 FR 38355 to 38370) and finds the evidenceinadequate to support this particular labeling claim. A review of productlabeling submitted to the Panel indicates that some products containingexpectorants were labeled with claims such as ``for relief of minor throator bronchial irritation,'' and ``soothes irritated throat membranes'';however, no data supporting these claims were provided (Ref. 1).Moreover, the data submitted on guaifenesin, the only expectorant ingredientincluded in this final monograph, did not demonstrate that guaifenesinrelieves irritated membranes in the respiratory passageways by preventingdryness through increased mucus flow. The guaifenesin data demonstratethat the drug increases sputum volume and viscosity (which supports theindications in this final monograph), but no evaluations were done to showthat the increase in sputum volume and viscosity relieved irritated membranesin the respiratory passageways. Therefore, in the absence of substantiatingdata, the labeling proposed in andSection; 341.78(b)(2) is not included inthe final monograph. However, the agency recognizes that many cough-colddrug products are formulated with inactive ingredients such as sugar-basedsyrups and other mucilaginous substances that can provide a soothing effecton the mucosa of the throat. As discussed in the tentative final monographfor OTC oral health care drug products, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of January 27, 1988 (53 FR 2450), terms suchas ``soothing'' may be used to describe the action of a sugar-based syrupor lozenge. Use of this term is not considered as making a demulcent claimbecause the term describes certain physical and chemical attributes ofa drug product and is distinctly separate from labeling indications. Termsthat describe product characteristics (e.g., color, odor, flavor, and feel)often appear in consumer labeling as additional product information. Becausesuch claims are not directly related to the safe and effective use of adrug product, the agency considers these claims to be outside the scopeof the monograph. Any term that is outside the scope of the monograph mayappear in any portion of the labeling not required by the monograph, butsuch labeling may not detract from the required information. Therefore,the labeling of an OTC expectorant drug product could include truthfulterms that describe product characteristics, such as ``soothing,'' providedsuch terms are placed in an area of the labeling that is outside the requiredmonograph labeling.<ITAG tagnum="81">Reference</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) OTC Volumes 040099, 040108, 040163, 040190, 040201, 040219, and040220.</ITAG>5. Proposed andSection; 341.78(c)(1) is not included in this final monograph.Proposed andSection; 341.78(c)(1) provided a warning not to give expectorantsto children under 2 years of age unless directed by a doctor. Because thedirections provided under new andSection; 341.78(d) state clearly that adoctor should be consulted for the use of expectorants in children under2 years of age, the agency believes that the proposed warning is repetitiousand unnecessary. According, proposed andSection; 341.78(c)(2) has been redesignatedas andSection; 341.78(c)(1), and proposed andSection; 341.78(c)(3) as andSection;341.78(c)(2).6. The agency has modified the warning proposed in andSection; 341.78(c)(2)of the tentative final monograph (redesignated as andSection; 341.78(c)(1))to include ``chronic bronchitis'' and has substituted the phrase ``phlegm(sputum)'' for ``secretions.'' (See comment 14 above.)7. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency proposed in anumber of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor''for ``physician'' in OTC drug monographs on the basis that the word ``doctor''is more commonly used and better understood by consumers. Based on commentsreceived to these proposals, the agency has determined that final monographsand any applicable OTC drug regulation will give manufacturers the optionof using either the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This finalmonograph provides that option. (See comment 15 above.)  8. In andSection; 341.90(d) the agency is including the following professionallabeling claim for guaifenesin as a single ingredient expectorant drugproduct: ``Helps loosen phlegm and thin bronchial secretions in patientswith stable chronic bronchitis.'' (See comment 7 above.)  <ITAG tagnum="85">III. The Agency's Final Conclusions on OTC Expectorant Drug Products </ITAG>Based on the available evidence, the agency is issuing a final monographestablishing conditions under which OTC expectorant drug products are generallyrecognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. Specifically, theonly monograph ingredient for expectorant use is guaifenesin. All otheringredients for expectorant use that were considered in this rulemakingare considered nonmonograph ingredients, i.e., antimony potassium tartrate,chloroform, iodides (calcium iodide anhydrous, hydriodic acid syrup, iodizedlime, potassium iodide), ipecac fluidextract, squill preparations (squill,squill extract), turpentine oil (spirits of turpentine), ammonium chloride,beechwood creosote, benzoin preparations (compound tincture of benzoin,tincture of benzoin), camphor, eucalyptol/eucalyptus oil, horehound, ipecacsyrup, menthol/peppermint oil, pine tar preparations (extract white pinecompound, pine tar, syrup of pine tar, compound white pine syrup, whitepine), potassium guaiacolsulfonate, sodium citrate, terpin hydrate preparations(terpin hydrate, terpin hydrate elixir), and tolu preparations (tolu, tolubalsam, tolu balsam tincture). Any drug product marketed for use as anOTC expectorant drug product that is not in conformance with the monograph(21 CFR Part 341) may be considered a new drug within the meaning of section201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(p)) andmisbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352) and may not bemarketed for this use unless it is the subject of an approved application.An appropriate citizen petition to amend the monograph may also be submittedunder 21 CFR 10.30.  No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specificcomment on the economic impact of this rulemaking (47 FR 30009). The agencyhas examined the economic consequences of this final rule in conjunctionwith other rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agencyannounced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resultingfrom the OTC drug review do not constitute a major rule according to thecriteria established by Executive Order 12291. The agency therefore concludesthat no one of these rules, including this final rule for OTC expectorantdrug products, is a major rule.  The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug reviewwas not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L.96-354. That assessment included a discretionary Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual ordisproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemakingfor OTC expectorant drug products is not expected to pose such an impacton small businesses. Therefore, the agency certifies that this final rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.    <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 341  </ITAG>Expectorant drug products, Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs.
