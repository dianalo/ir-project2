(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A metaphor for user interaction with systems...a model for databases...a newparadigm for software development.andP;  Object orientation is a concept that hasseduced developers in each of these three areas with the promise of quantumleaps in the function and usability of information systems.andM;It's tempting to view object orientation as a monolithic set of rules guidingall of this development.andP;  But that's not really the case, although there arecommonalities in each of the three major activity sets-applicationenvironments, databases, and languages/tools (see Figure 1).andP;  For the moment,however, developers in each area are pursuing different goals, and their usesof objects and object orientation are slightly different.andP;  With its NewWaveapplication environment, for example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) is trying to makesystems easier to use and customize.andP;  Ontologic, Graphael, ServioLogic, andofliers are using object databases to index complex electronic files, likeengineering drawings and compound documents.andP;  And vendors of programmingtools see object orientation as a fast, accurate, and flexible softwareengineering paradigm.andP;  Though they are separate today, these pools ofdevelopment are beginning to overlap each other and converge.andP;  As they do,object orientation product development is reaching floodtide.andM;&quot;Object Orientation: Defining the End-User Platform for the '90s,&quot; athree-day Technology Forum sponsored by the Office Computing Group (April3-5), brought together 50 vendors and some 300 attendees to understand thesedevelopments and to craft a vision of what objects can deliver.andP;  The hope isthat object orientation will yield considerable function very soon by makinginformation systems more accurate, flexible, extendible, and easy tomanipulate.andP;  Users simply need more Olan conventional technology alone canprovide.andP;  Specifically, according to David E.andP;  Liddle, CEO of MetaphorComputer Systems, objects can help create applicafions offering access todata wherever it is, data manipulation tools that can be used by anyone, andtools that allow users to develop their own applications.andP;  Bill Joy, vicepresident of Randamp;D at Sun Microsystems, told attendees that objects will allowsystems to adapt to individual needs, make information more accessible, anddeliver better software--&quot;more precise, customizable, and changeable&quot;--forthe buck.andP;  &quot;We can begin envisioning projects with fewer programmers,&quot; hesaid.andP;  The long-range expectation is thyt object orientation willrevolutionize the software industry.andP;  The revolution will be the developmentof interchangeable software modules that can be mixed, matched, and augmentedto build new applications.andP;  Insiders usually draw an analogy to theintegrated circuit business.andP;  There, off-the-shelf components comprise muchof any new design.andM;The Technology Forum had a sense of urgency.andP;  Attendees recognized thatobject technology is rushing forward, even though key standards andimplementation questions remain unanswered or barely understood.andP;  There wasgeneral agreement on the need for standards.andP;  The fact that the applicationenvironments and object databases are not in sync hampers die building offull object systems, for example.andP;  And the two major objectorientedprogramming languageas, C++ and SmallTalk, are based on entirely differentconcepts.andP;  Yet, there was no consensus on which standards are appropriatenow.andP;  Since die forum, two industry groups have been founded to address thestandards issue: the Object Management Group, which has gathered around apiece of HP's NewWave, and the Workshop on ObjectOriented Design.andP;  (Sec&quot;Consensus Builders&quot; page 16.)andM;Consensus will be helped along by the generally flat growth of the industry.andO;Attendees associated with systems vendors recognized that object orientationmay be a key to the future growth of their companies.andP;  When Liddle assertedthat the future of information systems is being held hostage by today'sstatic, brittle environments, nobody howled in protest.andP;  Office ComputingGroup president Patricia B.andP;  Seybold issued an open challenge to developcross-operating system object environments with full network and programmingsupport by 1992.andM;The 300 attendees and 50 speakers at the forum drove toward several majorconclusions.andP;  They are:andM;* Object orientation can be defined to include three basic characteristics:encapsulation of data and its functions into objects, interaction betweenobjects by passing messages, and inheritance of characteristics withinclasses of objects.andP;  Systems that leave out, say, inheritance, are said to beobject based.andM;* For both vendors and users, object orientation is a technology for today.andO;programming tools allow users and vendors alike to begin building powerfulnew user environments and software that's well beyond the reach ofconventional programming mentods.andM;* The learning curve for object orientation is high.andP;  Users like AmericanAirlines advised getting started now.andP;  Incremental benefits can be gainedwhile more sophisticated systems are being developed.andM;* Object-oriented techniques are being successfully combined withconventional systems to yield significant advances in function and ease ofuse.andM;* Developers need more and better development tools, including data-modelingpackages.andM;* Ageement on standards will accelerate the application of object orientationto distributed networks, unlocking dramatic new benefits.andM;* Seybold's challenge will be difficult to meet.andM;The Conceptual FrameworkandM;The most important thing to understand about objects is that they are notreal.andP;  They do not represent a new-fangled file structure or machinelanguage.andP;  Object orientation is a way w design systems.andP;  The systemprimitives and structures that we are familiar with today don't change.andP;  Forexample, an object &quot;containing&quot; the sales report for the Southeast region isactually a data file linked to a program file or a number of program files.andM;Object orientation's general concepts and benefits are well understood.andP;  Theterm object orientation arises from the notion that systems can be designedas a series of abstract modules called objects.andP;  Objects are self-containedand-defined specifications for packets of data and the functions, attributes,and relationships that define what the data do (see Figure 2).andP;  An objectknows about itself, and interacts with another object without having to knowwhat's inside it.andP;  An object hides its contents, dealing with other objectsthrough an interface that describes what it does.andP;  The principle, said AdeleGoldberg, president of ParcPlace Research Systems Incorporated, is: &quot;Don'ttouch; ask me.&quot; Objects that share similar characteristics are placed withinthe same class.andP;  For example, objects within a graphics class would definesquares, circles, and soon.andP;  An object can inherit the characteristics ofother objects within its class.andP;  Most often, &quot;parent&quot; objects in a class canpass characteristics to &quot;child&quot; objects (see Figure 3).andM;Systems based on these concepts yield important benefits.andP;  First,object-oriented systems model the real world more accurately than doconventional systems.andP;  Defining data in terms of their functions is a moreaccurate representation of information than is defining data in isolation.andO;Because an object's specification and its implementation are separate,implementations can be changed to achieve greater efficiency, take advantageof new technology, and so on, with a minimal impact on other pans of thesystem.andP;  Cobol maintenance programmers, take note.andP;  Inheritance allowsprogrammers to &quot;program the difference&quot; between a new object and existingobjects, offered Tim Andrews, chief architect of Ontologic Incorporated.andO;That saves effort in designing complex systems by allowing existing code tobe reused again and again.andM;Important variations on the general concepts yield still further benefits.andO;Polymorphism is the ability of an object to be associated with more than oneclass.andP;  Instances allow an object to have multiple identities.andP;  Thesefeatures leverage still further the benefits of inheritance.andP;  Aggregation isthe ability to build a complex new object using existing and new objects.andM;Pragmatists or Blasphemers?andM;It quickly becomes apparent that product designers use the general conceptsof object orientation for their own designs, and to hell with purity.andP;  Thus,Hewlett-Packard's NewWave is as different as it is similar to Ontologic'sobject database.andP;  Both systems are called object oriented.andP;  &quot;'Objectoriented' is a buzzword we stick on all kinds of things,&quot; noted Bill Crow,Randamp;D manager of Hewlett-Packard's Software Division.andP;  Bill Joy, vice presidentof Randamp;D for Sun Microsystems, was more blunt: &quot;Object orientation as a term isbecoming meaningless.&quot; A system isn't object oriented unless it starts withobjects, Joy offered, and many of today's don't.andM;Disagreement on terminology is symptomatic of a larger problem.andP;  Databasevendors refer to types, while language developers use the term classes torefer to the same thing.andP;  Many object-oriented products employ objects andobject-oriented precepts in different ways.andP;  NewWave, for &quot;ample, implementsinheritance in a more limited sense than do the progamming environments, thedatabases, and even other application environments.andP;  And what is an object?andO;HP's NewWave and the Andrew System developed at Carnegie Mellon University(CMU) in Pittsburgh define objects corresponding to entire applications.andO;Servio Logic's Gemstone object database allows objects of up to a billioncharacters in size.andP;  The major development systems, meanwhile, tend to prefersmaller objects and a finer granularity of objects.andM;Christopher M.andP;  Stone, manager of workgroup software for Data General, putforth the pragmatist case.andP;  &quot;Purity is beautiful,&quot; he said, &quot;but utility hasits own beauty, and it probably transcends all else,&quot; He believes developerswill likely apply object orientation in a progression through six layers ofthe typical system, using the basic concepts to achieve greater function insystems.andP;  The layers include, from top to bottom:andM;* The user modelandM;* The user interfaceandM;* ApplicationsandM;* Data managementandM;* Operating systems and networksandM;* HardwareandM;Most current systems stop at the user interface level, he said, and also aresinglesystem centric.andP;  The '90s will see object orientation pushed bothdeeper into systems and outward from individual systems onto networks.andM;In examining the issues in applying object orientation to commercial systems,forum attendees and speakers examined seven major areas: user environments,databases, distributed object management (on networks), compounddocument/object architectures, programming languages and tools, applications,and industry implications.andM;User EnvironmentsandM;User environments like Hewlett-Packard's NewWave, the Metaphor system, NeXT'sNextStep, and CMU's Andrew Toolkit give users object models that simplifyinteraction with complex resources.andP;  Although these environments sharesimilar goals, each employs object technology in a slightly different way.andO;This article discusses each of these areas.andM;HP NEWWAVE DEFINED.andP;  NewWave uses object-oriented techniques to extend die MSWindows environment.andP;  BP provides specifications that allow softwaredevelopers to take advantage of these extensions.andP;  The product is due out atthe end of the year, and versions for OS/2 and UNIX are targeted for releasebefore the end of next year.andP;  NewWave uses object orientation to integratethe kinds of applications we've come to know and love under MS-DOS into aunified user view.andP;  A NewWave object comprises a data file and an applicationprogram that acts on it.andP;  So, for example, an on-screen icon called &quot;CentralStates Sales Report&quot; would describe a spreadsheet file containing resultsfrom the central states plus a spreadsheet program.andM;In this example, the data file and the spreadsheet program are linked byNewWave's Object Management Facility.andP;  The OMF is a file that registers therelationships between files and programs, and it provides ways to invoke andupdate those files and programs.andM;OMF also keeps track of relationships between objects, giving NewWave itsreal power.andP;  For example, a text object can be combined with a graphicsobject and a spreadsheet object to create a sales report under NewWave.andP;  Tothe user, the text, graphics, and spreadsheet grid in the document representa whole view.andP;  To NewWave, however, the screen is displaying three snapshotsof data-program objects.andP;  If the user, upon analyzing the spreadsheet,decides to play with die numbers in it, he or she can click on that objectand do so.andP;  NewWave manages the opening of the application and appropriatedata file in a separate onscreen window.andM;Links between objects are interactive.andP;  That is, if the user changes thespreadsheet mentioned earlier, the OMF will ensure that all of die underlyingdatafile's manifestations are updated.andP;  At the forum, Bill Crow demonstrateda prototype that extends this model across a network, maintaining links amongobjects on different workstations.andM;NewWave's Agent Program Interface, meanwhile, enables users to constructsystem-wide macros operating on objects.andP;  Agents can be programmed byinvoking a &quot;record&quot; command from the main display.andP;  NewWave will then recorda series of steps in a script language.andP;  Script sequences can, in turn, bemodified or written from scratch.andP;  Agents help users automate rote tasks.andP;  Inpreparing a monthly sales report, for &quot;ample, a user under NewWave is able torecord the steps in gathering data, placing it in an analytical framework(like a spreadsheet), generating a chart, pulling it into a document,updating the commentary, and sending the resulting reprrt to superiors viaelectronic mail in an Agent script.andP;  The following month, invoking die agentwill take care of die entire update.andP;  Agents can also be programmed to reactto specific developments.andP;  For example, if the value in a specificspreadsheet cell exceeds a limit, it can send an E-mail message to asubordinate.andP;  Agents can also be programmed to perform tasks on certain datesor at certain times.andM;Today's Limits, Tomorrow's Goals.andP;  NewWave objects are big.andP;  In the jargon ofobject orientation, this characteristic is known as low granularity, and itplaces limits on NewWave's use of inheritance.andP;  A spreadsheet is actually acollection of many functions, or methods.andP;  Cuff enfly, NewWave can't breakthese apart for reassembly into new and useful combinations with othermethods.andP;  In some applications, for example, it might be useful for a texteditor to inherit the computational methods of a spreadsheet.andP;  Currently,inheritance in NewWave is limited.andP;  Our carlier compound document linkingtext, graphics, and spreadsheet inherits text, graphics, and spreadsheetcharacteristics from those objects.andM;In part, this limitation is a reflection of NewWave's platform.andP;  Windows andDOS work best with whole applications, says Crow.andP;  HP's goal in its OS/2 andUnix versions of NewWave is to allow greater granularity and a fuller use ofinheritance.andP;  It also will help bring NewWave into alignment with the objectsdefined by HP's object database management system project, code-named his.andO;Crow and Mary Loomis, manager for the Iris project, revealed at the forumthat HP's goal is to bring the two into line.andP;  Doing so would allow HP todistribute objects on a network, using the Iris-derived database to storethem on clients and NewWave as a front end on clients to manipulate them.andM;Object purists take pokes at NewWave for being pseudoobject oriented, Itisn't written in an object-oriented language, although Crow says it might besomeday.andP;  And the limitations of its support for inheritance rile purists.andO;But the product is amazing in what it brings to the Windows environment.andO;NewWave's goal is to integrate DOS-style applicafions.andP;  It does so withoutforcing software writers to change their basic approach (although they dohave a new set of interfaces to write to) and in spite of the considerablelimitations of the DOS platform.andP;  NewWave is not an object-oriented system inthe pure sense, but it doesn't pretend to be one.andP;  HP's challenge withNewWave is to speed development of third-party applications to itsspecifications and to quickly move NewWave onto platforms that will supportdeeper application of object orientation's concepts.andP;  The former of these isthe more important.andM;METAPHOR DEFINED.andP;  Dr.andP;  David Liddle protests when die label &quot;objectorientation&quot; is affixed to his Metaphor Data Interpretation System (DIS)system.andP;  Metaphor is not an objectoriented system.andP;  It doesn't implementclasses of objects or inheritance.andP;  Rather, Metaphor provides an object modelthat dramatically simplifies the building of complex financial analysisapplicafions by end users.andM;On a Metaphor DIS display, tools like spreadsheets and relational datasources are represented by icons.andP;  Users move these icons and link them witharrows into flow diagrams.andP;  Each diagram is called a capsule.andP;  Under diecovers, Metaphor provides a sophisticated mechanism for differentapplicafions to exchange data.andM;Typically, users, not programmers, build Metaphor capsules.andP;  What users getin capsules are sophisticated programs individually tailored to their needs.andO;And these are sophisticated programs.andP;  The average Metaphor capsule isdrawing data from five separate feeds.andP;  One of the earliest capsules,assembled by a Clorox Corporation assistant branch manager in 1984, replacedsome 90,000 lines of conventional code.andP;  It called for 14 different databasequeries of more than 1,000 SQL characters each, and was built in two days.andO;Liddle characterizes it as being of an average size.andP;  Capsules areself-contained enough to be sent via electronic mail for sharing by otherusers.andP;  (A complete review of the Metaphor system is available in Vol.andP;  11,No.andP;  8.)andM;Metaphor vs.andP;  NewWave.andP;  There are two key differences between Metaphor andNewWave.andP;  First, Metaphor is aimed at financial analysis applications, andNewWave is a general facility.andP;  There's no reason the Metaphor model can't beextended to other applicafions, but it hasn't been yet.andP;  Also, Metaphor willsoon begin offering its programming toolkit to independent softwaredevelopers.andP;  All of the tools included with DIS today were written byMetaphor.andP;  HP, on the other hand, is depending almost exclusive onthird-party software developers to provide tools for NewWave.andP;  Second,Metaphor doesn't have the equivalent of NewWave's OMF managing links betweencomponents of a capsule.andP;  Thus, consistency isn't assured.andP;  Take aspreadsheet file that's used in two capsules.andP;  If it is updated in theprocess of executing one capsule, Metaphor won't automatically update theversion of the file used in the second capsule.andP;  Despite these differences,Metaphor and NewWave are similar in their primary goal: to provide users witha customizable, easy-to-manipulate applications environment.andM;Like NewWave, Metaphor is not written in an objectoriented language.andP;  Liddlesays pans of the system are designed in an object-oriented way, and he'stooking at C++ and Objective C as environments for the future.andP;  The systemtoday runs on custom hardware, although Metaphor has ported it to 3 86-basedIBM PS/2s.andP;  Liddle also believes a port to Unix is inevitable.andM;THE ANDREW TOOLKIT DEFINED.andP;  The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a set of objectsarrayed in class libraries that provide a framework for an object-orientedapplications environment.andP;  It was developed at CMU as pan of the AndrewProject.andP;  ATK's class libraries empower users at the university to do threethings.andP;  First, it gives them all the tools they need to build sophisticateduser interfaces.andP;  Second, it provides a set of core applications andapplication building blocks.andP;  And third, it lets users build their ownobjects and easily add them to the core libraries.andM;Andrew is written in Class, an object-oriented language much like C++, and itimplements a fairly complete objectoriented system, It provides forinheritance in the classic sense through its class libraries.andP;  Objects in theAndrew Toolkit vary in size and complexity.andP;  In the interface-buildingclasses, scrollbars, buttons, and so on are objects.andP;  The system's texteditor is also an object, albeit a large one.andP;  Thus, for example, a table ofcontents object inherits core editing features from a text editor object.andM;Andrew separates objects into two types: data objects and view objects.andP;  Viewobjects are representations of data objects.andP;  Thus, in Andrew, a pie chartand a table are said to be two views of the same spreadsheet objectcontaining numbers.andP;  Views are full-blown objects; they inheritcharacteristics from other views, There is no equivalent of NewWave's ONE inthis picture; control is maintained via the class library structures.andP;  Theview/data split is important because it adds flexibility to data analysisrelatively easily.andP;  Achieving the same function in NewWave would requireseparate datafileprogram objects for each view.andP;  Also, by separating viewsfrom data, ATK's designers make it possible to change one of them-the userinterface or the underlying data structures-with minimal impact on the other.andM;Andrew Palay, senior systems designer at CMU's ITC, says that extending theAndrew Toolkit across networks will leverage the view/data split.andP;  Users atworkstations will work with views of data objects residing somewhere else.andP;  Sfill to come is a scheme to ensure data consistency (For an in-depth look atdie Andrew System, see Unix in the Office, Vol.andP;  4., No.andP;  4.)andM;A View to the Future.andP;  In many ways, the Andrew Toolkit's capabilitiesforeshadow the future of object-oriented application enviornments.andP;  thetoolkit was born of two requirements.andP;  The first was a need to supportmultimedia compound documents on networks.andP;  The second was the desire toallow users to add new objects to the system.andP;  Getting at die first goal, theAndrew Toolkit goes one step further than NewWave in its presentation ofcompound documents.andP;  When combining text, graphics, and spreadsheet, as inthe example given in &quot;HP NewWave Defgined&quot; above, Andrew would display theseobjects in the same manner as NewWave, but would allow users to manipulateeach in place on the display.andP;  Andrew is based on Unix, and its designerswere not confronted by the limits of 640 Kbytes of addressable memory.andM;The ITC chose to develop its own object-oriented programming language, Class,for several reasons.andP;  An important one was to gain a feature called dynamiclinking/loading.andP;  Dynamic linking is an advantage of the SmallTalk language.andO;It allows a module description to be linked to an implementation in code atrun-time, and that means implementations can change as needed with minimaldisruption to the system.andP;  Dynamic loading in Class provides strong interfacerules for new objects, which allow new objects to be added withoutmodification by the ITC.andP;  Palay's favorite example of a new object is themusical score editor added by music students.andP;  It leverages the text editor'score function with capabilities specific to fiddling with musical scores.andM;The Andrew Toolkit is not a commercial produc% although it is in use at CMU.andO;However, the toolkit has attracted wide attention because of its advancedfunction and because of IBM's funding for its development.andP;  IBM has sunk some$30 million into CMU's ITC, and retains certain rights to use technology itdevelops.andP;  Palay told forum attendees he has no knowledge of IBM's plans touse the Anandamp;ew technology in either SAA (Systems Application Architecture) orthe AIX (Unix) environments.andM;NEXTSTEP DEFINED.andP;  NextStep, the interface building component of the SteveJobs's NeXT machine, is similar to the Andrew Toolkit.andP;  In fact, it borrowsmany ideas from Andrew.andP;  NextStep, too, is an application environment thatincludes object-oriented programmatic support.andP;  NextStep is written inObjective C, a C van ant that implements support for classes, encapsulation,arid so forth.andP;  Also, NextS tep and the Andrew Toolkit both seek to empowerusers to build their own applications using systemprovided building blocks.andO;NextStep fronts PostScript with a window server to give software developers astrong front end to their applications.andP;  Bruce Blumberg, manager of diedeveloper support group at NeXT Incorporated, told forum attendees the designwas motivated by practical considerations.andP;  &quot;PostScript is a great imagingmodel but a lousy development environment,&quot; he said.andM;A strong, consistent imaging environment for display and printing gives usersand developers a foundation to build on.andP;  This environment is implemented inNextStep's class libraries.andP;  NextStep includes 38 object classes, including aPostScript manager, a text editor, system controls, ScrollView, a programminginterface, and a storage object.andP;  Building sophisticated interfaces is easedby invoking these object libraries.andM;The NeXT machine is a powerful platform for NextStep application builders.andO;It is based on Mach, a multiprocessing, multitasking Unix variant.andP;  Memory isno object (pardon the expression) in this environment, and Mach provides amessaging mechanism to aid object-to-object interaction on single systems andon networks.andP;  NextS tep uses messages to allow one application to coorperatewith another.andP;  A Speaker object sends a message to a Listener object, in aprocess similar to Metaphor's method.andP;  Control is exercised through classstructures.andM;The NeXT platform also theoretically allows objects generated with differentlanguages to communicate through the operating system, making the choice oflanguage irrelevant.andP;  Today, this is particularly important to NeXT and itsdevelopers.andP;  Objecfive C is losing ground to C++ as the preferredobject-oriented extension of the C language, but switching to C++ won't bedifficult for NeXT.andP;  S fill, Mach's blessings must be weighed against thecurse of being first in the market with a new product.andP;  Unfortunately forNeXT, Mach is not widely implemented.andP;  Thus, when NextS tep objectscommunicate with objects on other systems, some transformation will beneeded.andM;NextStep: The User's View.andP;  Like Andrew, NextStep allows users multiple viewsof the same data objects.andP;  Each view is a separate object, although displayobjects are not architecturally separated from the underlying data.andP;  Blumbergtold the forum that there's no reason NextStep can't separate display fromdata.andP;  Ironically, die limitations of NextStep from the user's perspectiveare in its object model.andP;  NextStep is primarily focused today on providingdevelopers with an interface toolkit, but its user features we lessdeveloped.andP;  It has no notion, for &quot;ample, of embedding objects within otherobjects, something both NewWave and Andrew provide.andM;Yet That is the operative word when it comes to NextS tep.andP;  The product lookslike a work in progress, and there's no reason to believe NeXT won't keepbuilding on what it has today.andP;  IBM has licensed NextStep for use on its AIXplatforms.andP;  As a powerful partner and a source of cash for a star-up, IBM wdialso, no doubt, articulate a fuller view of NextStep, oneandM;that also includes a strong object model for users.andM;DatabasesandM;&quot;What is an object-oriented database? I wish I knew,&quot; quipped Dr.andP;  Robert S.andO;Epstien, executive vice president of Sybase.andP;  Forum speakers discussed twokinds of databases: databases that store objects and databases thatincorporate object-oriented functions like inheritance.andP;  One other isrelevant to this discussion: object management facilities.andM;Small vendors are carrying objectbase management system (OBMS) technologyinto the market.andP;  Luge vendors are seated at the sidelines of this game,although Hewlett-Packard and Data General appear ready to enter soon.andM;OBJECTBASES DEFINED.andP;  objectbase management systems (OBMSs) areobject-oriented database management systems that combine support forobjects--data with its functions and meaning-and with object-orientationsystem-building features like class libraries and inheritance which have theexpected features of database management systems (concurrency control,administration, security, and transaction suppon, and even access by query).andO;Objects, in the database context, might be an engineering drawing or a bitmap describing a newspaper display advertisement or an accounting file withrules governing its usage.andM;There are three major benefits to this approach.andP;  First, storing objects forlater retrieval is a fast and meaningful data management scheme.andP;  For users,it may simplify operations involving complex and varied data types.andP;  With anobject describing an entire chip design, for example, an engineer would beable to run simulations of a design by pulling the object out of the databaseand running die simulation program against it.andP;  This seems straightforwardenough, but it is very difficut to do with cuffent database technology.andP;  Thehypothetical chip design may comprise a dozen or more nested data types.andP;  Andbeing able to reference them as a whole is no mean feat.andM;Second, OBMSs make it easier to build database applications.andP;  Because thesesystems store classes of objects, with inheritance, developers can reuseexisting objects (code) in building new applications.andP;  Just how muchprogramming effort this feature eliminates isn't clear yet, but vendors sayup to 40 percent savings is possible.andM;Third, OBMSs are much more malleable than record-oriented databases.andO;Abstraction, another of the general benefits of object orientation, isoperating here.andP;  The specification for the database objects and the actualimplementation of those objects are separate.andP;  That means designers canchange implementations-to achieve greater efficiency or even to introduce anew data type-with minimal or no impact on the specification.andM;Given the distinction between data and objects, nomenclature is a bitproblematic.andP;  &quot;Object database management system&quot; is an oxymoron;&quot;object-oriented DBMS&quot; is little better.andP;  More accurate terms: &quot;objectbase&quot;and &quot;objectbase management system (OBMS).&quot; The term &quot;object databasemanagement systems&quot; might then be reserved for DBMSs that can store objectsbut don't give users inheritance, classes, and so on.andP;  And &quot;object managementfacility&quot; appears wellsuited to facilities like NewWave's OMF (which iswell-named) and even serverbased databases that keep track of objects andtheir relationships to other objects.andM;FEATURES, FUNCTIONS, DIRECTIONS.andP;  Each of the OBMS vendors at theforum--Ontologic , Object Design, Graphael, and Servio Logic-basplatform-independent products, Ontologic's new product, code-named Ontos andscheduled for July 15 availability, typifies the cuffent thinking about thetechnology.andP;  Written in C++, from which it gains its object-orientedcharacteristics, the OBMS is built on a client-server model (see Figure 4).andO;Ontos is also designed to be open to the compilers and development tools ofother vendors.andM;To a large extent, all of the OBMS vendors offer the same features: classicobject-oriented characteristics as well as suppon for different versions ofobjects.andP;  Objects are stored in class structures determined by methods (orfunctions), yielding the benefits of inheritance and reusability.andP;  Versioningis a concession to the special needs of engineers, and it is implemented indifferent ways.andP;  Polymorphism is die way Servio Logic's Gemstone provides it.andO;A CAD file itself can be stored in die database, along with a version of diefile coupled with simulation procedures.andP;  Object Design's nascent ObjectStorewill extend the objectbase model by supporting types of objects, instances orobjects, and versions of both as objects.andM;Each of the objectbase vendors is also dealing with SQL in its queryingprocess.andP;  SQL presents these vendors with an interesting problem.andP;  Relationalstrucwres and SQL we diametrically opposed to objectbases and theirstructures.andP;  In the relational world, predicate queries are cast againstunknown structures.andP;  Objectbases, however, are best at navigating throughpointers defining a known structure.andP;  Yet SQL is a checklist requirement ofmany customers.andM;Two basic approaches have emerged to deliver the best of both worlds.andP;  First,it is possible to extend die types recognized by the SQL syntax, allowingobjects to be queried in addition to tables.andP;  Thus, adding &quot;dept&quot; to&quot;emp.name&quot; would yield die names of employees by department, assuming thatdepartment is an object.andP;  &quot;You're doing traversal as you do the SQL query,&quot;explains Ontologic's Tim Andrews.andM;The second approach is to allow applications to issue SQL queries and objectqueries in parallel, and then bring the two together in the application.andO;This is the method object design will suppon in its ObjectStore.andM;Performance is the major thrust of development at Object Design, Ontologic,Objectivity, and others designing &quot;second generation&quot; products.andP;  The goal,says Tom Atwood, is to simulate inmemory database performance in a virtualmemory architecture.andP;  Achieving it will require very fast schemes to traversethe pointers linking an object's components at minimum.andP;  Object Design isalso working on a compiler that analyzes workflows to optimize thepositioning of clements in a system in memory, cache, and storage.andM;FOR OR AGAINST RDBMS? Object-oriented databases were presented at the forumas a reaction against the tyranny of relational tables.andP;  The mere need to&quot;normalize&quot; data to fit die relational mathematical model compromisesflexibility, said J.andP;  Michael Connell, general manager for data managementsystems at Servio Logic Development Corporation.andP;  Numbers and characterstrings fit within the relational tables, but something more complex, say, avoice file or an accounting object containing rules goveming its usage, isonly a blob to an RDBMS.andP;  It can't be queried, just stored for laterretrieval.andP;  How do you normalize a voice blob? Forget it.andP;  And rules must beadded separately to RDBMSs or to applicafions built on them.andP;  WithObjectbases, rules we part of the structureandM;Yet three RDBMS vendors at the forum proposed that object orientation shouldbe added to the existing base of relational technology: Larry Stevens,director of tools marketing for Oracle Corporation, Aaron Zornes, manager ofstrategic marketing for Relational Technology Incorporated, and Bob Epsteincollectivery worried about the absence of standards among the new objectbasemanagement systems.andP;  The better approach, they said, would be to build uponthe standards defined for the relational world, extending RDBMSs toadditional data types.andP;  Zornes issued a bold prediction: &quot;Object-orientedprogramming and object-oriented DBMSs are going to provide the next quantumleap in productivity, integrity, and security in database systems, and theywill be based on today's relational technology.&quot;andM;Each of the vendors is moving to leverage object technology in its relationalproducts.andP;  Ingres from RTI manages application objects through a dictionaryand can store forms that are complex data types.andP;  Expanding on thesecapabilities will require suppon for additional data types, Oracle isexamining the potential of objects to add fixed rules on data use, or storedprocedures, to its database structure.andP;  Currently, these rules are imposed byseparate database applications in Oracle's world.andP;  Epstein told ofdevelopment cooperation between Sybase and NeXT to add the ability to storecomplex data types to the Sybase DBMS that is part of the NeXT machine'ssystem software.andM;WHERE OBMS AND RDBMS MEET.andP;  Is the industry about to witness a technologybattle similar to the one waged by relational vendors against conventionallDBMSs during the '70s? Probably not.andP;  Fortunately, the objectbase managementsystem vendors are all avoiding such confrontations.andP;  Indeed, there appearsto be general recognition of the need for both designs.andP;  Two vendors, ObjectDesign and Hewlett-Packard, have plans that may help bridge ODBMS and RDBMS(see Figure 5).andM;At the forum, Dr.andP;  Mary Loomis, manager of HP's Data and Languages Division,described a four-year object DBMS development effort at HP called Iris.andP;  Irisis not a product, but Loomis told the forum it will become the basis for one.andO;It is language independent, although it is written in C will a bit ofObjective C thrown in.andP;  Iris places an Object Manager on top of a &quot;foreign&quot;(read, &quot;relational&quot;) database and a module containing storage managers,transaction managers, and related DBMS functions.andP;  The Object Manager is arule-based query processor that also manages versions of objects.andP;  Usersthrow &quot;object SQL&quot; queries against the Object Manager, which routes them tothe relational database and to the function module.andP;  Object Design will takethis approach one step further by placing both an RDBMS and an OBMS under anobject manager, says Thomas Atwood, president.andM;TO MARKET, TO MARKET...andP;  The most immediate need for object databases is inengineering, and most of the vendors in the field today target that market.andO;Office applications like compound documents are just beginning to receiveattention from the OBMS vendors.andP;  Yet database vendors acknowledge thatOBMSs, in the long run, will be vital to managing objects distributed acrossnetworks.andP;  Object databases will be object directories on networks, saidLoomis.andP;  Short-term object management facilities will do on networks, but,eventually, applications will demand more power.andM;Loomis suggested that general user acceptance of object databases will takemuch longer than did the adoption of RDBMSs.andP;  The reasons: Teaching ageneration of developers how to effectively use the object-oriented approachwill take time, standards definition remains to be done, and RDBMSs havetremendous market momentum.andP;  Look for interesting combinations of the objectapproach with RDBMSs in the meantime.andP;  Dr.andP;  Larry R.andP;  Harris, CEO of AICorpIncorporated, described how his Knowledgebase Management System treats enfiredatabases as objects.andP;  &quot;Databases know how to take care of themselves,&quot; henoted.andP;  &quot;We encapsulate them and then pass messages to them to deal withthem.&quot; Used in this fashion, encapsulation makes SQL irrelevant, he said.andM;Distributed Object ManagementandM;The marriage of the object paradigm and network computing may be the mostpowerful pairing since Danny DeVito met Amold Schwarzenegger.andP;  Definingnetwork resources as objects can dramatically simplify user interaction withthem, while providing the general benefits of reusability and malleability.andO;The promise: Users will, for example, be able to fax a document by dragging adocument icon to sit atop a &quot;network fax object&quot; icon.andP;  Indeed, objects maybe the single most important enabling technology in the evolution towardnetworks linking heterogeneous resources.andP;  &quot;Integrating objects acrossheterogeneous systems is going to give all of us in this industry atremendous amount of leverage,&quot; David Hartzband, consulting engineer forsoftware architecture at Digital Equipment Corporation, told the forum.andM;THE RPC MECHANISM.andP;  Two methods of distributing objects were discussed at theforum: remote procedure calls (RPCs) between local object managers and objectdatabases on servers and electronic mail.andM;RPCs, particularly Apollo Computer's Network Computing System (NCS),attracted great interest at the forum.andP;  Chris Stone revealed the outlines ofData General's distributed object management strategy, which calls for adatabase of objects running on a server and providing object directoryservices on a network (see Figure 6).andP;  A remote procedure call is themechanism by which local objects communicate with other objects on thenetwork.andM;Why RPCs as the means for interaction between objects? Because an RPC is bothnetwork- and application -independent.andP;  Alternatives like IBM's LU6.2 are tooclosely tied to the network, while Apple's CL-1 is application specific.andO;Having an RPC mechanism is important, but which RPC probably isn't important.andO;The RPC is only a pipe, according to Stone.andP;  The real trick is defining theprotocol that allows network objects to talk to workstation objects.andM;At the forum, Bill Crow of HP acknowledged the potential of RPCs fordistributing object management, but stressed the need to be open to othermethods.andP;  &quot;We know where we want to get,&quot; he said, alluding to distributedobject management.andP;  &quot;NCS is a nice solution, but it isn't the only solution.andO;We also want to write to LAN Manager for Unix.andP;  Our objective is to removethe need for the developer to care about the mechanism.&quot; Crow's remarks atthe forum came before Hewlett-Packard committed to buying Apollo ComputerIncorporated, developer of NCS.andP;  Since then, Crow has expressed satisfactionat die prospect of having NCS a bit closer at hand.andM;HP AND DG: IN SYNC.andP;  There is a similarity between Data General's design andthe approach Hewlett-Packard has taken with NewWave.andP;  As we learned after theforum, both are driving forces behind die Object Management Group, Bothvendors assume that objects will register themselves with an object manager,be it the Object Management Facility on a NewWave workstation or the objectdatabase running on a server.andP;  Yet there is a fundamental diafference aswell.andP;  Stone's model calls for a fullfledged database at the server,something HP does not require at the workstation level and may not require onservers.andP;  Crow conceded that HP's networking strategy isn't complete.andP;  Theobject database must support classes, inheritance, aggregates (or compoundobjects), and methods, he said.andP;  Sitting out on die server, the objectdatabase will function as a location broker for objects, providing networkservices like mail to applications on the network.andP;  Object databases ondifferent servers will communicate using the same RPC mechanism used forclient-server interaction, he said.andM;Stone stresses pragmatic application of object techniques and technology tonetworks.andP;  The server-based database of network objects must be portable-DataGeneral's upcoming product won't require DG hardware-and flexible enough tosuppon both conventional and object-oriented programming.andM;VIEW/DATA SEPARATION.andP;  At the forum, Stone, Crow, Andy Palay, and othersagreed that any distributed object management scheme should architecturallyseparate actual objects from views of those objects.andP;  That is, regional salesdata should be logically distinct from displays of those data on aworkstation.andP;  This decoupling will maximize performance and configurationflexibility, said Michael H. Conner, senior programmer at IBM's Entry SystemsDivision (see Figure 7).andP;  User interface activity can very easily become thedelimiter of a system if every event tied strictly to the presentation of anobject, like positioning and sizing on the display, reverberates across thenetwork to die underlying object.andP;  Crow notes that NewWave's distinct UserActon Interpreter and Command Processor correspond to this design.andP;  CMU'sAndrew Toolkit also implements this separation.andM;MITIGATING FACTORS.andP;  The big question is how fast the industry can begin todeliver applicafions structured in this fashion.andP;  Conner believes thetransition will be very long.andP;  Others believe that coalescing around Apollo'sNetwork Computing Forum consortium, which promotes and guides applications ofNCS as a transport mechanism and X-Window as a distributed windowing system,would encourage rapid progress by applications developers.andM;There's no question that agreement on certain standards will speed adoptionof object-oricnted systems on networks.andP;  The convergence on architecturediscussed above was one of several signs at die forum that such agreementsare not only possible but also probable.andP;  The formation of the OMG andWorkshop on Object-Oriented Design (WOOD) groups promises to help fosterdiscussions.andP;  The most important standards issue today is deciding whichstandards are needed first.andP;  David Hartzband of Digital Equipment and AdeleGoldberg of ParcPlace worried aloud at die forum about how fast vendors canidentify and agree upon the appropriate standards.andP;  Goldberg argued thatobject orientation needs rapid innovation, not standards that will slowthings down.andP;  Hartzband is not encouraged by disagreements over fundamentalquestions like what an object is.andP;  &quot;Unless we develop common denominators,none of us is going to get very much leverage out of this technology,&quot; hesaid.andM;THE ROLE OF ELECTRONIC MAIL.andP;  Most of the discussion about distributed objectmanagement focused on synchronous operations.andP;  That is, interactions betweenobjects that require immediate responses.andP;  The forum participants, however,noted the need for both synchronous and asynchronous modes of distributingand transmitting objects.andP;  The asynchronous mode represents objectinteraction that is not dependent on an immediate response, like an objectsending a message to an agent to perform an operation and return the resultvia the agent when the task is completed (see Figure 8).andP;  Michael D.andP;  Zisman,CEO of Soft-Switch Incorporated, suggested that electronic mail systems are agood option to fill this need.andM;Electronic mail is evolving from a means to transmit text from one individualto another to an all purpose store-and-forward transport for objects.andP;  At theforum, Zisman proposed a model that places an object database and E-mailsystem side by side as twin pillars supporting object-oriented environments.andO;In this context, E-mail could perform three functions.andP;  First it could carrymessages from one object to another in a distributed environment.andP;  Each ofthese objects would have to be able to execute its function independently ofthe other, noted Zisman.andP;  He called this type of object &quot;strong.&quot; The secondfunction E-mail can provide in a distributed object environment is thransportof objects from one place to another on die network.andP;  Users might want tomove objects to take advantage of new platforms, to balance loads on thenetworks, or for any number of other reasons.andP;  Thirdly, mail systems cantransform objects from one environment to another and provide an objectdirectory to assist in routing and network management.andM;What's Needed in E-Mail.andP;  Three advances in today's Email technology arerequired before Zisman's model can be implemented.andP;  First, it requiresbackbone E-mail networks linking heterogeneous systems.andP;  Second, we needstronger programming interfaces to mail servers and a completion of the P3/P7X.400 protocol boundary for application connectivity.andP;  Third, these objectE-mail networks will require a naming registry.andP;  Lastly, Zisman cautioned, weneed more experience in integrating objects, E-mail, and applications thatleverage both.andM;Compound Documents/ObjectsandM;Are compound documents objects? Probably.andP;  Are compound documentarchitectures object-oriented? Probably not fully.andP;  Compound documents areone of the most confusing applications of object orientation, yet one of themost functional.andP;  Digital's Compound Document Architecture (CDA), IBM's MixedObject Document Content Architecture (MO:DCA), and the international ObjectDocument Architecture (ODA) standard, which were discussed at the forum, eachemploy object techniques to construct mixed-media documents.andP;  They're notobject oriented in the classic sense-like, say, the Anandamp;ew Toolkit-but doesthat really matter?andM;OBJECT MODELS VS.andP;  OBJECT SYSTEMS.andP;  What compound document architectures havein common today are object models.andP;  Digital's CDA, for example, permitsinformation distributed on a network to be displayed in a compound document,maintaining live links between the document and the supporting inform ation.andO;The document and its components are just so many objects, and document typesare arrayed in classes.andP;  MO: DCA doesn't appear to implement classes  yet.andM;Today's compound document architectures lay the groundwork for more of thefeatures of object orientation, David S.andP;  Camm, information services managerfor IBM's Application Systems Division, told the forum.andP;  MO:DCA's objectrouting, for example, allows a system to determine an object's identity anddo something in response to that particular object.andP;  The approach is based onobjects interacting by sending and responding to messages and actingaccording to the attributes of other objects.andP;  It's close to the pure stuff.andM;Indeed, the degree of their &quot;object-ness&quot; doesn't appear to be the mostimportant point to understand about compound document architectures.andO;Participants were more interested in sorting out the acronyms: How DCArelates to MO:DCA relates to ODA relates to CALS (Computer Assisted LogisticSupport).andP;  DCA is aimed at providing a baseline for multimedia compounddocuments in the DEC world.andP;  IBM's goal with MO:DCA is to provide a similarbase for IBM systems.andP;  ODA is aimed at all vendors, and is strongest today asa finished-document interchange, although it is expanding.andP;  SGML (StandardGraphics Markup Language) is a standard for format-independent compounddocuments that is an important component-of the federal government's CALSinitiative.andP;  DCA has been implemented in five Digital products, including thelatest release of DECwrite.andP;  MO:DCA products will be coming soon, Cammhinted.andM;Programming ToolsandM;Given the state of object-oriented programming tools, the explosion inapplications of object orientation's concepts is miraculous.andP;  The softwareindustry is rushing to use object techniques even as vendors try to answerprickly questions about methods and models and integration protocols.andP;  BenRubenstein, chief technologist at Index Technology Corporation, silenced aforum session on programming tools by listing all of the areas ofdisagreement-from object models to subsystem models to event models-withinthe industry.andP;  Obviously, since then, the WOOD group has begun forgingconsensus on these questions.andM;Tools discussed at die forum fell into two categories: object-orientedprogramming tools and tools that use objects.andP;  In the former category,Whitewater Group's Actor and Object/1 from MDBS Incorporated offer anobjectoriented language in an environment featuring a full suite of tools.andO;Actor runs under Windows; Object/1 is OS/2-based.andP;  Some of these tools willseem strange to Cobol programmers.andP;  For example, inspectors allow developersto look within an object; browsers, within a class struucture.andP;  Objectdebuggers are also different from conventional debuggers.andP;  And incrementalcompilers make more sense for object-oriented development than do monolithiccompilers.andM;How important is the choice of a language? Chuck Duff, chief technicalofficer of Whitewater, cautioned attendees not to settle for anything lessthan a full object-oriented language.andP;  Bill Joy agreed: Objects can't beadded to a nonobject product; they must be in the paradigm and shot throughfrom bottom to top.andP;  That would appear to rule out the industry's (and,indeed, Sun Microsystems') favorite language, C++ from ATandamp;T.andP;  acturally, Joysaid what's needed is not so much C++, but C++-+-++ etc.andP;  Joy's personalfavorite: Eiffel from Interactive Software Engineering.andM;THE LANGUAGE CONTENDORS.andP;  C++ extends the C language with object-orientedfeatures, and it allows intermixing of the two languages with their separateparadigms.andP;  Ontologic's Tim Andrews cited this feature as a real boon todevelopers.andP;  &quot;The philosophy of C++ is 'never provide abstraction at theexpense of performance.' When abstraction has a performance cost, provide away around it,&quot;' he explained, Donald Kretsch, development manager at ATandamp;T,notes that C++ has been buoyed by its heritage in familiar C.andP;  In its nextC++ relase, ATandamp;T will also increase the language's stability by offering adetailed reference manual.andP;  (See Unix in the Office, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  6.) At theforum, Kretsch predicted an IEEE standard and commodity status for thelanguage within five years.andM;But forum participants said there is room for more languages and toolkits.andO;Indeed, C++, SmallTalk, Actor, Eiffel, and proprietary languages from KB MSand IBM were represented at the forum.andP;  Major distinctions between thelanguages include suppon of dynamic binding vs.andP;  static binding.andP;  Forexample, SmallTalk binds code into objects conforming to an objectspecification at run-time, while C++ largely requires binding to be decidedbefore compiling.andP;  Run-time binding is very flexible, allowing implementationdecisions to be made well after objects are specified.andP;  Static binding isless flexible, but more conducive to optimizing systems.andP;  Also, everything inSmallTalk proceeds from a system object, while C++ allows scattered objectlibraries intermingled with nonobject components.andM;While these distinctions are often portrayed as the freewheeling West(SmallTalk) vs.andP;  the conservative East (C++), the two languages actually arewell-suited to separate kinds of applicafions.andP;  Indeed, they complement oneanother.andP;  Rather than being messy, this variety contributes to a richengironment.andP;  And, as vendors like Sun and ParcPlace begin porting theirdevelopment tools and environments to C ++, developers won't even have tosacrifice much to move from one language to another.andP;  Ideally, added Joy,object programming languages will be operating system independent.andP;  Hebelieves they may even supplant operating systems.andM;TOOLS THAT USE OBJECTS.andP;  Tools using objects to improve software developmentrange from Nexpert from Neuron Data to of all things--an object-oriented,structured design methodology from Interactive Development Environments(IDE).andP;  Nexpert uses objects and an inference engine to integrate softwareresources.andP;  A related Open Interface Toolbox provides an object library tobuild graphical user interfaces to complex environments.andP;  IDE's methodologyleverages structured design with objects.andP;  The two approaches arecomplementary, said Anthony 1.andP;  Wasserman, president.andP;  Object-orientedStructured Design adds inheritance and class hierarchies to structured designand results in improved modularity and reusability in a familiar environment.andM;WHAT PRICE IN PERFORMANCE? Many forum attendees worried that object-orientedsystems will run slowly and hog resources.andP;  Participants protested the badrap object systems have received.andP;  The Actor toolkit, for example, runs in180K on a Windows-based PC.andP;  NeXT's toolkit is a 300K shared library, &quot;Wetake a 10 percent performance hit for using object orientation,&quot; saidBlumberg, &quot;but this is dwarfed by the benefits and flexibility we gain.&quot; TheATandamp;T attendee noted that internal studies have revealed that C++ runs 10percent faster than C in conventionally designed programs, but a C++ programwith object-oriented design runs 45 percent faster than an equivalent Cprogram.andM;Participants had several pieces of advice for those gening started inobject-oriented software design and construction.andP;  First, recognize thatbuilding models of data, not leaping into coding, is the first step, andprobably most of the hard work, of object-oriented program ming.andP;  How to getstarted? Good objectoriented software is simple, but hard to build.andP;  ChuckDuff asserted that the best class does one thing, not many.andP;  &quot;A good classhierarchy takes a miracle of understanding,&quot; offered Bill Joy.andP;  CMU's AndrewPalay urged attendees to tackle small and simple modules first Joy added&quot;high impact&quot; to that list.andP;  The client/server architecture is the bestarchitecture to start with, participants agreed.andP;  ApplicationsandM;AMERICAN AIRLINES.andP;  Since 1983, American Airlines has doubled the number ofpassengers carried, the size of its fleet, th number of daily departures, andthe size of its labor force, and has tripled its profits.andP;  That's the goodnews.andP;  But how was the airline to continue growing without bursting out ofcontrol in the future? That question caused American's top management tomandate a new informal on environment to support American employees, JoyceWrenn, vice president of information systems technology, told forumattendees.andP;  And InterAAct, as the environment is known, will begin leveragingobjectoriented technology in June.andM;American's object is to control new hires by making its employees moreproductive.andP;  InterAAct will give some 14,000 users wide access to a varietyof information resources.andP;  Eventually, all American Airlines employees willhave access to this &quot;online machine&quot;: accessing manuals, completing, signing,and routing electronic forms, accessing reservation and flight-systeminformation, and communicating with decision-makers around the world.andP;  (Formore information on InterAAct, see P.S.andP;  postscript on technology, Vol.andP;  1,No.andP;  5.)andM;The user interface for InterAAct is NewWave.andP;  Initially, said Wrenn, NewWavewill save on training costs and improve the interaction between applications.andO;Long term, it will front for powerful object-oti ented applications.andP;  Actorhas been deployed under the NewWave interface to build an executiveinformation system.andP;  Developers can prototype applications rapidly withActor, and changes to programs are simple.andP;  Amefican has also licensedSmallTalk to begin building a data model that assumes wide access by users.andO;At the time of the forum, American was six months into this project.andP;  Wrennadvised attendees to build frequent checkpoints into similar projects.andO;Indeed, American brought in a consultant to check its work after threemonths.andM;HOUSTON CHRONICLE.andP;  What is a newspaper? To Jack Stanley, vice president ofoperations for the Houston Chronicle, it is &quot;10,000 to 50,000 individualobjects that come together in 15 minutes.&quot; The Chronicle entered a jointproject with Camex about 18 months ago to introduce object technology to diepaper's daily production processes.andP;  The plan is to implement new systems onnetworked Sun workstations and control a huge pool of objects in a SybaseDBMS,andM;A display advertising system comprising 64 Suns supported by 128GB of storagecame first.andP;  The system allows ad production personnel to sneeze at theinevitable change requests from advertisers.andP;  Ads are now just collections ofgraphic objects that are very easy to change.andP;  Ads that were built in 20 to30 hours now require 2.andP;  And die Chronicle has attracted new business bytouting the ability of the system to modify magazine ads to fit a broadsheetformat.andP;  Later this year, die Chronicle will install a classified advertisingsystem running on Sun 3/50s.andM;Next year, the Chronicle will begin installing a new editorial system.andO;Reporters and editors will use Sun workstations to write and edit, and willhave access to the paper's morgue (running on DEC VAX), systems running onIBM mainframes, and multiple information feeds.andP;  Stanley estimates thevarious editorial resources will fill some 300 to 400GB (but who'scounting?).andP;  Pagination, or the ability to design some 5,000 full pages perweek, will be added to the system in 1991, giving editors the same basicbenefits the display ad department has now.andM;This networked design requires an industrial strength network, said Stanley.andO;By next year, virtually every employee of the newspaper will be on thenetwork, some of them on low-cost XTerminals.andP;  The Chronicle's backbone hastransfer capacity of 100 MBps to carry the large image files that eventuallywill run over the network as editors and production workers prepare and pulltogether all of the elements of each day's editions.andM;ConclusionsandM;The implications of the separate developments in object orientation are huge.andO;Object orientation promises significant gains in software function andprogramming productivity today.andP;  A little further out, it promises dramaticsimplification of network computing for users.andP;  Eventually--dare wehope-object orientation may transform the way software is sold and used.andM;There are many hurdles to overcome as the industry seeks to leverage the fullpower of the object concept.andP;  There's the need for consensus on certain baseconcepts and ideas, which must then become robust standards.andP;  There's a needfor more rigorous development models and design standards.andP;  And users needbetter modeling and development tools than exist today.andM;Those technical issues may be easy to figure out compared to the economicchallenges object orientation presents.andP;  Dave Liddle of Metaphor points outthat today's technology, techniques, and economic framework suppon softwaredevelopment aimed at improving the speed with which familiar applications areperformed.andP;  A few bells and whistles are added along the way, of course.andP;  Theproblem: How much new value has the industry been adding to spreadsheets,word processors, etc.andP;  under this model? The answer can be found in theindustry's slowing growth rate, reflecting a business that's more and moredependent on selling upgrades to existing customers than on creating newusers.andM;How long will vendors resist change? Liddle's challenge to forum attendees tothink beyond today's model for software development was timely and practical.andO;Object orientation can help deliver applications and tools that users cancustomize to their individual needs.andP;  This will take us well beyond theindustry-tailored applications provided by VARs.andP;  Object orientation cansuppon the splitting of huge, monolithic applicafions into meaningfulpackages of features and functions.andP;  Developers can offer a menu of featuresand functions to users.andP;  And surely object orientation supports thedevelopment of complex and malleable software that just can't be built withconventional methods at a reasonable cost.andP;  It just may hold the key to newusers and new sources of revenue.andM;Vendors and leading edge users are coming to understand this complex ofpotential and issues today, but it shouldn't be long before we all are.andO;Opportunities exist today.andM;Coming Soon: A Seybold Special Report on object orientation will detail thevision, the issues, the players, and the applications in this rapidlydeveloping field.andM;Consensus BuildersandM;Standards, or the lack thereof, were a shadow theme at the Seybold TechnologyForum on object orientation.andP;  Presenters and attendees alike worried thatobject orientation's promises will be compromised if a basis for multivendorsystems cooperation doesn't begin to emerge soon.andM;Weeks after the forum, two organizations began seeking ways to fill the gapwithout stifling the innovation an infant field needs.andP;  The Object ManagementGroup (OMG), a consortium of vendors, and the Workshop on Object-OrientedDesign (WOOD), a loose gathering of vendors and consultants, formed and metwithin a week of one another in late April.andP;  The groups, each in its ownsphere, have begun the delicate search for consensus on a baseline formultivendor, object-oriented systems.andM;The groups complement one another.andP;  OMG is focusing on how to promote acommon application evironment across vendor platforms.andP;  Founding members areHewlett-Packard, Data General,Sun Microsystems, Unisys, 3Com, Prime Computer,Gold Hill Computers, Philips International, Canon, and American Airlines.andO;Octel has since joined.andM;The group coalesced around HP NewWave's Object Management Facility (OMF) asits core technology.andP;  Something like an OMF will obviously be needed ifNewWave-like environments are to be distributed across networks.andP;  Chris Stoneof Data General, acting director of the OMG, said a top priority will bedefining protocols allowing objects to interact across networks,andM;WOOD is after the elusive definitions of terms on the programming and systemdevelopment side of the equation, including object databases.andP;  In its firstmeeting, participants representing AION Corporation, Ontologic, ObjectDesign, Index Technology, Object Sciences, Stepstone, ParcPlace, andInteractive Software Engineering, among others, agreed on basic definitionsfor object-oriented design, object-oriented database, object-orientedprogramming, data abstraction, class, and a number of other points.andP;  (Seepage 6.)andM;&quot;The good news is that there was an agreement to agree,&quot; says BurtRubenstein, chief technical officer at Index Technology and organizer of theworkshop.andP;  There were 24 attendees at the workshop; 17 others have agreed tomonitor the group's activities.andP;  The WOOD group's future lies in the hands ofOOPSLA, the industry's official body and conference organizer.andP;  WOOD willseek official sanction to continue its work, says Rubenstein.andP;  Failing that,it will seek to convince OOPSLA to found a similar group.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
