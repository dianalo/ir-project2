So few actual workers were elected as delegates to the party'scrucial national congress set for next month that the leadershipmay issue special invitations, said Janusz Bisztyga, the centralcommittee spokesman.   ``The share of workers is disquietingly low,'' Bisztyga said.``We have called on all party groups to work out a differentsolution.''   The percentage of workers has not been calculated while delegateelections continue, but the spokesman offered two examples of theproblem: the Baltic province of Slupsk, with only one worker andtwo farmers among the 22 delegates, and the central area of Kielce,with only four blue-collar workers among the 44 delegates.   The situation is dire for the party, created for theproletariat, said Wieslaw Veitz, a sociologist and party member,during a news conference called to discuss the congress, whichmeets Jan. 27.   ``It is not that the party leadership is losing touch with thebase. In fact there is no contact with the base, because if we hadcontact, the situation would not be as it is now,'' he said.   The Communists' iron grip on Poland's government and economybroke in the last year. First, they turned to the independentSolidarity movement they had sought to crush, seeking help with theeconomic crisis and social unrest. Then they suffered a stingingpopular rejection during unprecedented democratic parliamentelections, leading to the East bloc's first non-Communist primeminister and a Solidarity-led cabinet.   Now huge government budget subsidies and tax exemptions thatfunded Communist Party activites are ceasing Jan. 1, while economicreform is radically reducing the role of the party in state-runindustries. And within four years, the party will have to facefully free elections.   The party congress, the 11th since the Communists consolidatedpower in postwar Poland, may be its last in its current form.Struggling to retain a place in the nation's political future, theparty is expected to adopt a new name and a program that will castit as broadly leftist supporting parliamentary democracy.   ``Today the party's future is being discussed by a narrow groupof intelligentsia, and lacks participation from the workers,'' saidZbigniew Sobotka, an alternate Politburo member from the Warsawsteel works.   ``If we are to discuss the future of the party, we should givethe floor to the people who have been most identified with theparty so far,'' he said.   ``We do not want a situation where after the congress there isno base of membership to support the reformed party.''   A Workers Congress Forum was created at factories in Warsaw togenerate interest in party issues among the workers who Sobotkadescribed as frustrated by slow party reform and the leadership.   In preparation for the congress, new rules were established formore democratic election of the 1,500 delegates. Previously,participants were approved by party leaders.   But Sobotka said that in the elections, ``members of theintelligentsia have an advantage. ... They are more eloquent thanthe workers.''   Among the alternatives being considered to bolster workerrepresentation at the congress are inviting delegations fromfactories to speak to the session, allowing factories to elect theguests and making them full delegates to the congress of any newparty that is formed, Sobotka said.   Also, said Zenon Szoda, a Polish Academy of Science professor,``We do not confine ourselves to the working class, we mean peoplewho are gainfully employed. We do not reject people who haveproduction means _ private farmers, private entrepreneurs.''   The party has a membership of just under 2.1 million in a nationof 39 million, down 1 million in the last decade and 35,000 in thefirst half of 1989, according to an August report.   About 37.5 percent of the members are workers, compared with52.1 percent who are members of the intelligentsia: managers,teachers and others whose jobs require higher education. The restare in agriculture.   The Central Committee reported in October that 72 percent ofmembers favored changing the name, charter and program of the partythat was formed in 1948. The report said there were 70 proposalsfor a new name.   Polish Communists have been studying their Hungariancounterparts, who voted Oct. 7 to scrap the old party and replaceit with a socialist one.</TEXT></DOC>
