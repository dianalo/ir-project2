Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh asked U.S. District JudgeGerhard Gesell to put off trial of the three main charges of theIran-Contra indictment if he refuses to relax an Aug. 1 deadlinefor producing a host of secret documents to the defense.   If the first three counts are severed from the indictment, ``theintelligence agencies can continue the process of collecting andanalyzing their documents to assure completion of any additionaldiscovery ordered by the court,'' while North is tried on the othercharges, Walsh said in a court filing.   In turning over a number of documents on Monday for North'sinspection, the government made ``a reasonable, good-faith effortto comply with the court's order,'' Walsh said. But the governmentagencies need more time to find the documents covered by thejudge's order, the prosecutor said.   Failure to comply fully with the order should not result indismissal of the first three counts of the indictment, Walsh said.North should be ordered to make a more specific request fordocuments he wants to see, the prosecutor added.   Walsh said the 13 charges that North lied to Congress, shreddeddocuments, illegally enriched himself and committed tax fraud toraise money for the Contras are ready to be tried on Sept. 20 asoriginally scheduled by the judge.   ``The criminal conduct alleged in these counts is discrete, andthe allegations, far from involving novel legal theories, areroutine,'' the prosecutor said.   The charges, which include allegations that North illegallyaccepted the installation of a $13,000 security fence outside hishome and pocketed $4,300 in travelers checks from the Contras,don't involve a wide range of classified documents, Walsh said.   But unless Gesell gives the government more time to producesecret documents to the defense, Walsh said, the main chargesagainst North could not be tried next month.   Those three counts charge that North conspired with formernational security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealersAlbert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord toillegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguanrebels.   In addition to the conspiracy charge, the four defendants areall charged with wire fraud and theft of government property.   The three charges constitute what Walsh has previouslycharacterized as the main part of the case against North and histhree co-defendants, who will be tried separately.   Gesell ordered the government to produce a large quantity ofsecret documents to the defense that he ruled would help Northestablish that he acted with approval of higher authorities.   In a filing last week, prosecutors asked that Gesell extend theAug. 1 deadline for production of those documents, noting that theCIA and other government agencies had opposed public disclosure ofmany of the documents.   ``Much of the information called for by the court's July 8 ordercan never be disclosed publicly. The need to search it out,nevertheless, now threatens to derail the schedule for trial setdown by the court,'' Walsh said in his pleading last week.   North, meanwhile, has asked Gesell to postpone the trial untilnext March, saying his defense team needs more time to study thethousands of pages of documents already turned over by Walsh.   The defense also contends that trying the case during thisfall's presidential campaign would make it impossible to obtain animpartial jury verdict.   At a hearing last week, Gesell threatened to dismiss the firstthree counts of the indictment unless the government turns over thesecret documents North needs to defend the charges.   In a recent letter to Walsh, the CIA said that it was willing tolet North inspect most of the documents covered by his request butthe agency would not allow their declassification for use at apublic trial.   Walsh conceded in today's filing that ``the problems of publicdisclosure are formidable and the outlook discouraging.'' But heurged the judge to give him a chance to show the documents wouldn'tfurther a defense that North acted with approval of higherofficials in the Reagan administration.   The prosecutor said he can prove that ``no authorized covertactions identified in North's supplemental discovery request weresufficiently similar to the conduct charged in the indictment tolead North to believe that that conduct would be proper.''   Walsh said he knew ``of no analogue for the diversion (ofarms-sale funds) charged in the indictment.''</TEXT></DOC>
