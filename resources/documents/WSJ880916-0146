The pulp and paper and packaging concern said final approval for the project will depend on obtaining Argentinian government support, financing, and a satisfactory technical evaluation. Consolidated is 40%-owned by Power Corp., Montreal.    The mill, to be built in Corrientes province, would be owned jointly by Consolidated and two Argentinian companies, Massuh S.A. and Ledesma S.A.A.I. It would have initial production of 100,000 metric tons of pulp a year, to be sold mainly in international markets. </TEXT></DOC>
