In February the staff had suggested a $50 million rate cut.    The Chicago-based utility is seeking a $1.4 billion rate increase, to help pay for three nuclear-power plants it recently completed. A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that while the company hadn't seen the staff recommendation, the revision &quot;appears to be at least the third time they've changed their arithmetic.&quot;    A commission spokeswoman, noting that commissioners aren't bound by the staff recommendation, said the revised number could change again because of pending nuclear plant audits.    But the ballooning of the staff's recommended cut could spell trouble for the utility. In the past, the commission staff has been regarded as a company ally.    As previously reported, the utility has urged regulators to approve a flat 27% rate increase. Commonwealth Edison said that amount is necessary to pay $7 billion in costs associated with three nuclear plants it recently completed. With a dozen nuclear plants, the utility is the largest nuclear power generator in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
