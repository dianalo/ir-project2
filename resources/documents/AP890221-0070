RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to referee adispute between the U.S. government and American businesses stemmingfrom the 1981 settlement of the Iran hostage crisis.   The court said it will review a ruling that businesses recoveringmoney from Iran's government do not have to pay a portion of it tothe U.S. government.   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iranincluded release by the U.S. government of billions of dollars infrozen Iranian assets. The settlement also set up a processpermitting those with claims against Iran to take them to aninternational tribunal.   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former PresidentJimmy Carter to approve the settlement.   That question was not at issue in the case acted on today, inwhich Sperry Corp. and Sperry World Trade Inc. made a claim againstIran.   The companies leased computer systems to Iran during the 1970s,before the hostage crisis severed relations between the UnitedStates and Iran.   After the hostages were freed in January 1981, the Sperrycorporations were awarded $2.8 million by the international tribunalset up to handle claims against Iran.   Congress in 1985 passed a law requiring those who win such claimsto pay to the federal government 1.5 percent of the first $5 millionrecovered and 1 percent of amounts over that.   The fee is to reimburse governmental expenses in helping resolvethe claims.   The government said the Sperry corporations owed it $42,000.   A federal appeals court here ruled last August that the fee is anunconstitutional seizure of private property by the government.   ``Whatever (the fee) was thought to be, it was a taking ofSperry's money to help settle the national crisis, a burden thegovernment must bear on behalf of all of us,'' the appeals courtsaid.   Justice Department lawyers, in seeking Supreme Court review, saidtens of millions of dollars are at stake. Some $12.7 million alreadyhas been deducted by the government from awards to successfulclaimants.   The government's appeal said it is reasonable to require thosethat win claims against Iran to defray the $4 million the U.S.government spends each year to help operate the Iran claims process.   The case is U.S. vs. Sperry Corp., 88-952.</TEXT></DOC>
