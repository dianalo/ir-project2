A summit between presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and HosniMubarak of Egypt will take place in early January, the primeministers of both countries announced. Syrian Prime MinisterMahmoud Zoubi said restoring ties ``will open a new page in thehistory of our common destiny.''   The accord was announced at the end of a one-day visit toDamascus by Prime Minister Atef Sedki of Egypt. At a newsconference, Sedki and Zoubi said they agreed to exchangeambassadors. They gave no date for the January summit.   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials said the development couldimprove Israel's peace prospects with the Arab world. Egypt is theonly Arab nation with which Israel has a peace treaty, and Syriahas been an implacable foe.   A statement released in Cairo and Damascus said: ``Thegovernments of the Syrian Arab Republic and the Arab Republic ofEgypt have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations, effectiveWednesday, Dec. 27, 1989. This comes to express the determinationof the two peoples to consolidate brotherly relations in allfields.''   The announcement said changes worldwide made both countriesrealize the ``necessity of achieving comprehensive Arab entente asa sound basis for joint Arab action.''   Syria and Egypt were united in 1958 under a pan-Arabic movementled by Sadat's predecessor, Gamal Abdul Nasser. They resumedindependent governments in 1961.   Assad broke ties after Sadat made a dramatic visit to Jerusalemin 1977, the opening move in two years of negotiations thatresulted in the Egypt-Israel peace accord.   Avi Pazner, aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,characterized Wednesday's agreement as ``part of Egypt's going backto the Arab world'' after its ostracism.   ``We hope it will bring about a bigger realization in the Arabworld that peace with Israel is possible and desirable,'' he toldThe Associated Press.   However, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Israel did not seethe agreement as ``signifying any change in the Syrian positionregarding Israel or peace.''   Sedki, the first such high-ranking Egyptian official to visitthe Syrian capital since the rift, met for two hours with Assadbefore the announcement. He said the results of the meeting were``even more than I originally expected.   ``President Assad talked very warmly about Egypt and recalledall the past and historic ties between the two countries. Hefurther qualified the period of complications as an experience weshould profit from.''   Damascus radio said Sedki carried a message to Assad fromMubarak. He did not disclose its contents.   ``The purpose of this trip is to take the last step, followingwhich comes the resumption of ties,'' Sedki said. ``Egypt's goal isto unify ranks with Syria and consolidate cooperation between ourtwo countries.''   In a brief statement to reporters, Zoubi said developments``witnessed by the Arab world require that Syria and Egypt returnto each other on the basis of their historical and fraternalbonds.''   Mubarak said Tuesday that he and Assad planned to meet, butindicated this would follow restoration of diplomatic links.   Mubarak said his policy was never to allow improvement ofEgypt's relations with any country to affect ties with anothernation.   This appeared aimed at both Syria and Iraq, ruled by rival wingsof the Arab Baath Party and at odds for years.   Egypt aided Iraq militarily in its eight-year war with Iran.Syria backed Iran.   Seventeen Arab states severed relations with Egypt after theCamp David peace accords with Israel in 1979. All except Libya nowhave restored diplomatic ties with Egypt.</TEXT></DOC>
