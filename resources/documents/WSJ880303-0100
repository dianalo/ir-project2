His government already had adopted an expansionary policy, he said, by allowing the federal deficit to rise sharply this year, to about 40 billion marks ($27 billion), 10 billion marks more than forecast.    But deficit growth is hardly expansionary. It owes partly to higher payments to the Common Market. Mostly though it is a consequence of a limping economy and the slide of the dollar. The German central bank, which had budgeted a six billion mark surplus for 1988, recently realized that its dollar-denominated reserves are no longer what they were when the budget was written. So in January it scheduled a six billion to seven billion mark write-off.    That's in radical contrast with the early 1980s, when the Bundesbank was raking in profits from the dollar's climb. For instance, it realized about $5 billion a year as the dollar rose from a rate of 2.25 marks to 3.15 from the end of 1981 through the end of 1984, according to a rough calculation by John Mueller, economic counsel in Washington to U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp. &quot;Now the process is reversed,&quot; Mr. Mueller says, &quot;and Germany is losing about $4 billion a year on its foreign exchange reserves; it's not surprising that the budget moves in the same direction.&quot;    In this context, it's understandable that Mr. Stoltenberg is crossing his fingers that the dollar will stabilize around 1.70 marks. Combined with higher payments to the EC and a slowing economy, any further weakening in the dollar would do further budget damage.    Germany -- with unemployment at 10% and rising, and an economy that will be hard pressed to exceed 1% growth this year -- needs to get serious about a more flexible labor policy, deregulation and privatization. But what the country needs the most is to stimulate growth and motivate investment. Merely toughing it out, as Mr. Stoltenberg prefers to do, will make it tough on everyone. </TEXT></DOC>
