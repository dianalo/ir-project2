(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Dialing for HelpandM;Not too long ago, vendor support of PC software products wasn't an issue withusers--after all, it was virtually nonexistent.andP;  Call a software company witha technical question about a particular product, and you were likely to bereferred to poorly written reference guides or to dealers whose knowledge ofsoftware rarely extended beyond retail prices.andP;  Today, fortunately, thatsituation appears to be a thing of the past.andP;  As the playing field of majorPC software manufacturers narrows, the companies are looking to their supportcenters to provide competitive advantages.andP;  For consumers who haven't had todeal with PC software support centers since the early days of microcomputers,it's now a totally different experience.andM;&quot;Support is one of the main things a company's reputation is built on, bethat good or bad,&quot; says Dan Lunt, vice president of marketing for WordPerfectcorp., Orem, Utah.andP;  &quot;If you support your products well, you generate atremendous amount of good will.andP;  If your support is poor, you generate theother kind of will.&quot;andM;To enamor users and attract new buyers, the kingpins of PC software areinvesting heavily in support.andP;  A survey conducted in conjunction with thisarticle shows these companies staffing support centers with about 10%(Microsoft Corp.) to 33% (WordPerfect) of their total employees.andP;  MicrosoftCorp. has set an industry precedent by constructing a 50,000-square-foottwo-story building, dedicated exclusively to support activities, near itsheadquarters in Redmond, Wash.andP;  Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass.,andO;now bundles six free months (a $50 value) of Prompt, its premium supportservice, with its three most recent products.andM;Support in the PC software business is delivered through various media,including users' manuals, training seminars, and technical newsletters, amongothers, but the most popular form is the telephone hot line, where a baffleduser can turn to a sympathetic voice for technical insight.andP;  &quot;WordPerfect has380 operators fielding 10,000 calls daily on our toll-free 800 hot line,&quot;explains Lunt.andP;  &quot;If a person buys our product, we feel that it is ourresponsibility to ensure that he or she can use it in the way it was intendedto be used.&quot;andM;WordPerfect, the only major PC software vendor to provide toll-free telephonesupport, is widely regarded as an industry leader in the support area.andP;  Its800 number has been in existence for five years, and the monthly bill for theservice now totals $300,000.andP;  Most of that amount results from questionsrelating to the company's main product, the WordPerfect word processor, whichretails for $495.andP;  &quot;We regard free support as a marketing expense,&quot; continuesLunt.andP;  &quot;Despite the high cost--it's one of our greatest corporateexpenses--we have no plans to abandon it.&quot;andM;Alice Allen, information center consultant and a director of theBaltimore-Washington Information Center Association, pays this firm theultimate compliment.andP;  &quot;I don't like WordPerfect as a word processor, but Idon't hesitate to recommend it because the company's technical support is sogood.&quot;andM;Buying Decisions Based on SupportandM;According to Allen and other veteran users, corporate buyers don't mindpaying more for a product if they can count on after-sale support.andP;  &quot;Itypically base half of the decision on whether or not to buy a product onsupport,&quot; states Julian Horwich, section manager of office technology at aFortune 100 company and executive director of the Chicago Association forMicrocomputer Professionals.andP;  &quot;I won't even consider a vendor that doesn'tprovide adequate support--usually through a hot line, unless the software isa one-of-a-kind product.&quot;andM;Judging &quot;adequate&quot; support is a problem in itself, asserts Gene Talsky, anindustry consultant.andP;  &quot;The support provided by a vendor ebbs and flows overtime and may even vary from product to product within a company,&quot; he explainsfrom his office in Old Lyme, Conn.andP;  &quot;Take WordPerfect, for example.andP;  Thecompany has been very committed to end-user support from day one, but it hashad trouble keeping up with its rapid growth.&quot;andM;Lunt admits that users have had difficulty getting through on his firm'stoll-free hot line, especially after the release of WordPerfect version 5.0last May.andP;  To help alleviate the situation, the company expects to increasethe size of its support staff to 400 by the start of 1989.andM;Forecasting the demand for support is one of the more challenging sides ofthe business, observes Richard Farmer, a director of systems and marketingwith Microsoft.andP;  &quot;If a product's growth exceeds our forecast, we're behindthe power curve and there's a support imbalance.andP;  We're getting better,though, at predicting demand for support.andP;  The support function in generalhas grown and matured.andP;  Like Henry Ford's assembly line, there were a fewkinks early on, but it now runs very efficiently.&quot;andP;  Farmer, who joinedMicrosoft in December 1981 as one of three support technicians, has watchedthe support services staff grow to 250 out of a total corporate head count of2,800.andM;Leaving the Customer SatisfiedandM;The Microsoft support center as described by Farmer is typical of major PCsoftware manufacturers.andP;  User calls to the support hot line are routed by anautomatic call distributing (ACD) system to specially trained technicians.andO;The ACD segregates calls by product according to information entered by theuser via telephone touch tones.andP;  For example, at Microsoft, some 45 productsare supported across three operating systems.andP;  Personal computers networkedto a historic database of product bugs (&quot;workarounds&quot;) and commonly askedquestions give technicians quick information for fielding user inquiries.andO;The technicians, who at one company spend an average of 11 minutes on thetelephone with each user, are trained in customer relations as well astechnical knowledge.andP;  &quot;One of our main goals is to leave the customersatisfied,&quot; says Farmer.andM;Though similarities exist in the way companies operate support centers, keydifferences show up in the pricing of services.andP;  All vendors offer freeproduct support through the mail.andP;  In other words, written queries describingproblems or questions related to a particular product are answered at nocharge.andP;  For the vast majority of users, however, writing a letter and thenwaiting for a reply is tantamount to no support at all.andM;When today's PC users speak of support, they typically mean instant help overthe telephone, which ranges from WordPerfect's no-charge bank of WATS linesto Ashton-Tate's $3,000-per-year &quot;comprehensive&quot; corporate and governmentsupport program.andP;  Ashton-Tate's package features a dedicated senior supporttechnician; a VIP toll-free hot line; access to electronic support serviceslike a bulletin board and CompuServe technical forum; and enrollment incompany training seminars for dBase, Multimate, Framework, and otherproducts.andP;  Most companies offer a mix of services tailored to differentclasses of customers.andM;Whether or not a user must pay before calling a hot line varies from companyto company.andP;  The Torrance, Calif.-based Ashton-Tate, for example, offersunlimited support for the first 90 days after product purchase.andP;  Foradditional support, a user must enroll in a support service plan, the leastexpensive being extended support, which costs $50 per year per product.andO;Under this plan, the user is entitled to 15 support calls and a subscriptionto a technical newsletter.andP;  Calls made as a result of problems with softwarebugs are not counted against the 15-call allotment.andM;Another extended support plan is the one offered by Aldus Corp. of Seattle,the manufacturer of PageMaker desktop publishing software.andP;  Aldus customersreceive 45 days of unlimited telephone support beginning with their firstcall.andP;  Extended support, priced at $100 annually, provides up to five hoursof continued telephone suport after that period through a toll-free number.andM;The third and most sophisticated support level is commonly referred to ascorporate support (or, in the case of Ashton-Tate, comprehensive support).andO;As a minimum, this level of support usually includes,in addition to theservices of extended support,access to a bulletin board system or electronicinformation service (such as CompuServe) with a historic database that a usercan scan to find answers to previously solved problems.andP;  Microsoft users, forexample, can pay $495 for 12 hours of connect time to an on-line knowledgebase.andP;  This on-line service also provides electronic communication withsupport engineers and participation in discussions with other users.andM;&quot;Willing To Pay for Support&quot;andM;Generally, business users like Talsky and Horwich praise the multitieredlevels of support tailored to users of varying needs and sophistication.andP;  &quot;Iexpect to pay for good support,&quot; concedes Talsky, &quot;but some people believethat software should cost no more than $99 and come with unlimited support.andO;I fault the computer press for creating that illusion.andP;  Even if a product isselling for $200, how many support calls will that pay for?&quot;andM;While Horwich agrees that support is costly and is &quot;willing to pay for it,&quot;he advises vendors to bundle unlimited basic telephone support in the priceof a software package even if that means a higher end-user cost.andP;  &quot;Sometimes,the cost of cutting paperwork for a purchase order to enroll in an extendedsupport program is more than the cost of the extended support itself,&quot;Horwich says.andP;  &quot;Maybe you just need answers to a few simple questions, butthe 45- or 90-day grace period for unlimited support calls has expired.andP;  Forcorporate users, it's better if a basic level of unlimited support isincluded in the original price of the product.&quot;andM;Besides having to pay for telephone support, another common complaint aboutthe service relates to quality.andP;  &quot;It's very aggravating to call a hot lineand reach someone who assumes you know nothing,&quot; laments Allen.andP;  &quot;When Icall, I'm not looking for advice on how to install a product.&quot;andM;A couple of years ago, when &quot;many companies paid only lip service to productsupport,&quot; Allen stopped calling the hot line for a popular database productbecause she &quot;typically knew more than the person on the other end of thephone.&quot;andP;  Manufacturers counter that their new corporate and comprehensivesupport programs route power users like Allen to senior support personnel.andM;Learning from Users' ProblemsandM;Users who do call support centers with their problems are unwittinglyinfluencing the next generation of products.andP;  &quot;We capture data on questionsand problems,&quot; says Farmer, &quot;and it becomes a feedback channel todevelopment.andP;  Developers use the information to identify problem areas in thesoftware and ultimately reduce the support load by improving the nextgeneration of products.&quot;andM;Given the investments that software vendors are making in support centers andthe fact that users have come to expect instant help over the telephone, themean price of sophisticated software products appears destined to hover at$495.andP;  Vendors seem reluctant to cut support as a way of lowering thepurchase prices of products.andP;  Says Lunt, &quot;At one time, we considered lettingcomputer store dealers and other end-user sales outlets handle support forour products, but with the number of software packages they stock and therelatively high turnover rate of their employees, dealers are rarely in aposition to know any one product well.&quot;andM;Lunt adds that when WordPerfect first set up its distribution channels yearsago, one of the reasons why the package appealed to dealers was because theydidn't have to support it.andP;  &quot;Micropro required dealers to provide after-salesupport for WordStar, the most popular word processor in those days.andP;  Thecompany has since changed that requirement, but in the meantime our policy ofcompany-supplied, no-charge support helped us gain a competitive advantage.&quot;andM;Some industry analysts wonder if the need for support will diminish, giventhat the much-ballyhooed user-friendliness of software is on the rise.andP;  Luntacknowledges a change rather than a decrease in support activity.andP;  &quot;Theemphasis is shifting.andP;  Although we're getting fewer calls about simplethings, the number of calls on advanced features is picking up, reflectingthe increased complexity and sophistication of today's software.&quot;andM;Microsoft's Farmer sees another factor becoming more prominent in the supportequation.andP;  &quot;The multivendor environment poses new complications.andP;  When one ofour products is interacting with product Z from vendor A and a problemarises, we can't tell the customer to ask vendor A to change his product.andO;Instead, we try to recommend a workaround.&quot;andM;Farmer cites product interactions as one of the reasons why support willcontinue to be an integral part of leading PC software packages.andP;  &quot;Peoplewill not be repeat customers if support is lacking,&quot; he stresses.andP;  Micromanager Horwich reinforces that notion.andP;  &quot;The companies that support theirproducts will be the ones that survive.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
