The main objectives of thestudy were to investigate the structural changes in coal during the weatheringprocess as well as to develop a simple, reliable weathering index, whichcan monitor indirectly the weathering-induced changes in physical andchemical properties. Although there have been numerous publications onstructure and reactivity of coal, most data reported in the literaturethus far have been obtained on coal samples of uncertain weathering statusand therefore need to be interpreted with great caution. Weathering hasa profound effect on many important coal properties such as heating value,caking characteristics, acidity, flotability and reactivity in liquefaction,combustion and gasification processes. The objective of developing aweathering index is to predict these coal property changes due to weatheringwithout resorting to real-time measurements or pilot plant runs. Thisreport is comprised of four main chapters: I. Structural Changes dueto Weathering; II. Material Balance in Weathering Process; III. Developmentof a Reliable Weathering Index; and IV. Proposed Weathering Mechanisms.A battery of sophisticated analytical tools and techniques was employedduring this study. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry in time-integrated, aswell as in time-resolved modes with computer-aided data analysis techniques(such as factor and discriminant analysis), gas chromatography, thermogravimetry/massspectrometry and solvent extraction were used for determining the roleof oxygen during the weathering process. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry,Free Swelling Index and a novel slurry pH technique were employed asweathering indicators. 170 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
