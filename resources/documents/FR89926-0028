Full-scale fatigue testing by the manufacturer has identifiedcertain significant structural components associated with the wing centerbox which are prone to cracking. These structures are fatigue sensitive,and extensive repairs may be required if corrective action is not takenin a timely manner. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reducedstructural integrity of the wing center box. Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-53-241, dated February3, 1989, which describes procedures for repetitive inspections for cracksin the rear spar underneath the internal angle at rib 1 area of the centralwing box, and repair, if necessary; Service bulletin A300-53-243, datedFebruary 3, 1989, which describes procedures for repetitive inspectionsfor cracks and broken panel stiffeners in the forward rear lower panelleft-hand and right-hand stringers at crossing areas, and repair, if necessary;and Service Bulletin A300-53-244, Revision 1, dated January 25, 1989, whichdescribes procedures for repetitive inspections for cracks of the drainholes at the forward and rear lower panel stringers, and repair, if necessary.The French DGAC has classified these service bulletins as mandatory, andhas issued French Airworthiness Directive 89-109-097(B), addressing thissubject. This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require repetitive ultrasonic and rotating probe inspections,or close visual inspections of various components associated with the centralwing box, in accordance with the service bulletins previously described.It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 52 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.operators is estimated to be $137,280. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
