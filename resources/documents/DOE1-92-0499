All animals in the experiment were given a singleintratracheal dose of 25 mg dust in 0.5 ml isotonic sodium chloride solution.The animals were examined at intervals of one day or one to 18 months.No dust was discovered in the light microscope after 24 h, and no clearlypathological reaction was found within a period of 18 months. None ofthe histological preparations showed signs of incipient gramuloma offibrosis of the lungs. A chemical analysis using flameless atomic absorptionspectrometry showed no increased concentrations of Al, Cr, and Ni inthe parenchymatons organs (lungs, kidneys, livers). Lead was rapidlyaccumulated in the fermur at the onset of the experiments and was eliminatedin the course of 18 months. A mutagenicity test according to Ames provedthe applied dust to be clearly non-metagenic. The dust used in the experimentcan thus be assumed to be largely inert. Still, it should not be consideredcompletely safe, as the risk of permanent or intermittent exposure wasleft out of account in the experiment. (orig./MG)</TEXT></DOC>
