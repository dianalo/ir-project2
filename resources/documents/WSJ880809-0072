The galaxy, named 4C41.17, was discovered by scientists using a new search strategy. It was located because of the enormous power and peculiar spectrum of its radio emissions.    The galaxy is more than 90% of the distance to the visible limits of the universe, the announcement said.    The discovery was made by Ken Chambers, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, and George Miley, astronomy professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was stationed at the telescope science institute in Baltimore by the European Space Agency. They made their observations with Wil van Breugel, an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley.    Extremely distant galaxies are of great interest to astronomers. Because light from them takes billions of years to reach the Earth, remote galaxies can be used to provide data about the early stages of the universe. The record distance of the new galaxy means it is being seen only about a few billion years after the big bang, which many scientists believe marked the beginning of the observable universe.    The announcement was made in Baltimore at the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union. </TEXT></DOC>
