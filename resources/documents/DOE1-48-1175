<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-1175 </DOCNO><TEXT>Metallic Materials Research Institute, Tohoku University, an apparatuswas recently installed which can generate a steady strong magnetic fieldof 31 T. The heart of this apparatus is a hybrid magnet which consistsof a large-diameter superconducting coil and a water-cooled ordinarilyconducting coil which consumes large power. The following measurementsare conducted under this strong steady magnetic field. (1) Magnetization-- the process of magnetization is measured by the electromagnetic inductionmethod for detecting variations in magnetic flux which occur when theposition of the specimen is changed; two techniques are often used forthis method: vibration technique and drawing technique. (2) Magnetoopticeffect -- a new spectroscopic apparatus was installed; this apparatusfeatures optical fiber for connections between the spectrometer and specimenholder and between the specimen holder and detector. (3) Magnetoresistanceeffect -- Shubnikov-de Haas vibration and magneto-phonon resonance whichare observed in critical temperature, semiconductor, and semimetal aremeasured. (4) Magnetic field -- The intensity of magnetic field is measuredaccurately. (13 figs, 15 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
