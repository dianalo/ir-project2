There was skepticism among Wall Street analysts, however, that the action will significantly improve the company's fortunes.    In confirming a Washington Post report, a spokesman for the Blue Bell, Pa., computer maker said the moratorium on pay raises extends through the end of the year, while the hiring suspension will last for an undetermined period. He said the measures represent &quot;another ratchet up&quot; in a cost-containment program begun last fall.    Budgets for travel, capital spending, administrative expenses and research and development for the second half of 1989 also were trimmed, the spokesman said. He indicated that the company also is considering other steps, including plant closings and layoffs in addition to those previously announced. Earlier this year, Unisys said it would dismiss 2,500 people, or 3% of its work force. &quot;We're looking at our cost structure and what has to be done to bring that in line with the business environment,&quot; the spokesman said.    Some securities analysts who follow Unisys raised doubts that the actions will do much for the company's problems, which include high inventories, declining orders and fallout from a price war.    &quot;Freezing salaries and hiring is a move in the right direction but it isn't going to solve its problems,&quot; said Barry Tarasoff, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder in New York. &quot;Its fundamental problem is lack of demand. You can't save your way out of that problem.&quot;    In July, Unisys said second-quarter earnings tumbled 67% to $53.6 million, or 17 cents a share, from the year-earlier $162.3 million, or 78 cents a share. Revenue rose 7.6% to $2.57 billion from $2.39 billion. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Unisys closed at $22.25, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
