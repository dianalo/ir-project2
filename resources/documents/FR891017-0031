The proposal would allow specially authorized personsto take dangerous or incorrigible nuisance bears that would normally beremoved by State or Federal authorities to minimize continued conflictand to prevent human injury. Removal would be accomplished through a State-administered hunt restricted to a specific area encompassing the Idaho,Montana, and Wyoming portions of the Yellowstone ecosystem outside Yellowstoneand Grand Teton National Parks. The proposal allows greater flexibilityin the management of grizzly bears without increasing the number of bearsnormally removed from this area.

Its populations in the conterminous United Statesare now restricted to northeastern and northwestern Washington, northernand eastern Idaho, western Montana, and northwestern Wyoming. Fewer than1,000 individuals are thought to remain in these areas, with the majorityin the Northern Continental Divide ecosystem in northwest Montana and theYellowstone ecosystem in northwestern Wyoming and adjacent portions ofMontana and Idaho. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4> of July 28, 1975 (40 FR 31734), the Servicedetermined threatened status for the grizzly in the conterminous UnitedStates, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531<T3>et seq</T3>.). Special regulations were issued in conjunction withthat determination and were incorporated into 50 CFR Part 17.40(b). Theserules provided general protection for the species but allowed taking undercertain conditions to defend human life, to remove nuisance animals, andto carry out research. In addition, a limited sport hunting season wasauthorized in a specified portion of northwestern Montana.The present proposal would modify the portion of the special rule addressingremoval of nuisance bears to include specially authorized persons amongthose authorized to remove dangerous or incorrigible nuisance bears inthe Yellowstone area. Removal would be accomplished by means of a supervisedhunt administered by State game agencies. Hunting for grizzly bears hasnot been permitted in the Yellowstone ecosystem since 1974 (Montana portion)and 1975 (Wyoming portion). The State of Wyoming also limited the baitingof black bears for hunting in portions of grizzly bear range outside YellowstoneNational Park in 1982 because of concern about the number of accidentalgrizzly kills by black bear hunters. The rationale for the proposed change is as follows: Under the existingspecial rule, a grizzly posing a serious threat to human safety can belegally taken by a person in self-defense or in defense of others. A dangerousbear can also be controlled by government officials. However, only State,Federal or Tribal officials are presently allowed to take a grizzly bearthat is potentially dangerous or that causes significant property loss.Upon closer examination, the Service now recognizes that while it is absolutelynecessary and advisable for authorized wildlife officials to make the crucialmanagement decision on whether to relocate or remove a depredating or potentiallydangerous grizzly, it is not necessary for the conservation of the grizzlyto restrict the act of removal to Federal, State, or Tribal authoritiesonly. Therefore, new regulatory language is suggested to allow nuisance bearsthat would normally be removed by State or Federal officials to be takenby specially authorized persons under the supervision of State game managementauthorities in portions of the Yellowstone area outside Yellowstone andGrand Teton National Parks. Control of nuisance bears within National Parkswould remain the responsibility of the National Park Service. The changewould not result in any additional bears being taken in the Yellowstoneecosystem. Data on human-caused grizzly bear mortality in the Yellowstone ecosystemfrom 1980 to 1987 show that a total of 22 nuisance grizzly bears have beenremoved from the ecosystem over the last 8 years, or an average of 2.8per year. Of this total, 12 were removed from outside Yellowstone and GrandTeton National Parks. Therefore, the average number of nuisance bears removedfrom the area subject to this proposed rule change was 1.5 bears per yearfrom 1980-1987. Since no change to the criteria used to evaluate nuisancebears will result from this proposed rule change, the average number ofdangerous and/or repeat offender nuisance bears taken over the last 8 years(1.5 bears/year) is an indicator of the number of bears expected to betaken in the future by specially authorized persons under this proposedrule change.The criteria used to judge whether a bear is a nuisance or not and howand where taking of such animals can take place are specified in the InteragencyGrizzly Bear Guidelines (Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee. 1986. InteragencyGrizzly Bear Guidelines. 100 pp. Published by U.S. Forest Service and availablefrom the Regional Forester, U.S. Forest Service, Federal Building, Missoula,Montana 59802). The Guidelines were made available for public comment,with portions published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on May 28, 1985 (50 FR 21696). In addition,19 public meetings were held in Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyomingto explain and discuss the Guidelines.The final Guidelines were adoptedon November 25, 1985 (51 FR 42863) by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committeeas the management document directing the management of the grizzly bearin the conterminous United States. Under these Guidelines, decisions relating to the determination of nuisancebear status and the method used to control nuisance bears outside NationalParks are made jointly by the Fish and Wildlife Service, the appropriateFederal land management agency (e.g., Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management)and the appropriate State game agency (e.g., Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Washington).With regard to the determination of nuisance bear status, a grizzly bearmay be determined to be a nuisance if any or all of the following conditionsapply: <T3>Condition A: </T3>The bear causes significant depredation to lawfullypresent livestock or uses unnatural food materials (human and livestockfoods, garbage, home gardens, livestock carrion, and game meat in possessionof man) which has been reasonably secured from the bear resulting in conditioningof the bear or significant loss of property.<T3>Condition B:</T3> The bear has displayed aggressive (not defensive)behavior toward humans which constitutes a <T3>demonstrable</T3> immediate or potential threat to human safety and/ora minor human injury resulted from a human/bear encounter. <T3>Condition C:</T3> The bear has had an encounter with people resultingin a <T3>substantial</T3> human injury or loss of human life. If a grizzly is determined to be a nuisance bear using the criteria above,capture is usually attempted, and a decision is made within 24 hours onwhether to relocate or remove (i.e., kill or transport to a zoo or research)the bear. The decision on the appropriate control action to be taken ismade after evaluating several factors, such as the nature of the bear offense(Condition A, B, and/or C), the number and type of offenses the bear haspreviously committed, and the age and sex of the nuisance bear. A detailedexplanation of the nuisance bear criteria and the process for determiningthe appropriate control action to be taken may be found in the Guidelines.The supervised hunt would be conducted in accordance with Federal and Statelaw and regulations. The selection of hunters would be at the discretionof the State game management authority. It is anticipated that hunterswill be selected through a State-run lottery system, wherein persons interestedin participating would submit their names and a list of potential hunterswould be created through a random drawing, with the first name drawn atthe top of the list. When a bear-human conflict arises that (a) is diagnosedin accordance with the Guidelines as a dangerous or incorrigible nuisancebear situation for which removal is the appropriate remedy, and (b) thecircumstances are such that a supervised person is an appropriate meansof removal, the first person on the list will be contacted. If that personcan arrive within 12-24 hours, he/she will be the person specially authorizedto remove the dangerous or incorrigible bear. If not, the next person onthe list will be offered the opportunity. The authorized person would besupervised and accompanied by State game management authorities. Edible baits would not be permitted, as usage may attract nonnuisance bears,positively reinforce an association between humans and food rewards, andthereby create new nuisance bears. Nonedible baits or attractants wouldbe permitted at the discretion of the State game management authority.Nonedible baits or attractants could attract bears to a well-chosen sitewhere the hunter and accompanying State game official could clearly vieweach bear to determine whether it was the problem nuisance bear, withoutcreating a human-food association. This would decrease the possibilitythat the wrong bear would be taken and improve the likelihood of a cleankill. Muzzle loaders and archery hunting would not be permitted, as theseare less effective removal methods with greater safety risks for the hunter.After 5 years, a formal evaluation will be conducted to assess the numberof bears taken, evaluate the impact of the rule change on grizzly recoveryin the Yellowstone ecosystem, and to determine if refinements are necessary.Questions may arise as to how the take of nuisance bears by specially authorizedpersons in the Yellowstone area differs from the Montana grizzly hunt authorizedunder 50 CFR 17.40(b)(1)(i)(e). The major differences are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Different wildlife management objectives.</T3> The Montana hunt isessentially a limited sport hunt used to relieve population pressures and,in some instances, remove nuisance bears in the Northern Continental Divideecosystem bear population. By tending to remove unwary bears more so thanwary bears, the Montana hunt also acts as a general preventative to reducepotential bear/human conflicts in the area. In Yellowstone, the hunt wouldbe an animal damage control hunt with the sole purpose of remedying orprecluding significant human/bear conflicts by removing known incorrigibleor dangerous nuisance bears. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Different, disjunct grizzly populations are affected:</T3> The Montanahunt is restricted to the Northern Continental Divide population of grizzlybears in northwest Montana. This grizzly population is entirely separatefrom the bear population in the Yellowstone ecosystem that would be affectedby the proposed rule change.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Different regulatory systems are used, with different degrees of impacton affected bear populations:</T3> The Montana hunt is regulated by a quotasystem that limits the number of bears that can be taken by humans in theecosystem each year. If the known number of female grizzly bears killedor removed reaches 6, or if the known total number of all grizzlies removedor killed reaches 21 (including an allowance of 7 bears to represent annualunknown human-induced mortality), then the Montana hunt is terminated.Hence, the net effect would be that no more than 6 female grizzlies or14 grizzlies overall can be removed by authorized hunters each year inthe Northern Continental Divide ecosystem. In the Yellowstone area, huntingwould be restricted to nuisance bears that would have been removed anywayby authorized government officials. The net effect of the proposed actionwould be that no additional bears would be taken. <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>_Different levels of State supervision during the hunt:</T3> Authorizedhunters are not required to be accompanied by State game officials in theMontana hunt. In the Yellowstone area, specially authorized private personswill be accompanied by State game officials to ensure that only the specificoffending bear is taken. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Analysis </ITAG>A draft environmental assessment was prepared to provide a preliminaryassessment of the impacts of the proposed rule, and is available at theoffice of the Grizzly Bear Recovery Coordinator (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> above).
