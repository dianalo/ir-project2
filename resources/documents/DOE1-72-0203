Anattribute grammar is a declarative formalism for specifying the translationfrom one language to another. The basis of an attribute grammar is acontext-free grammar. This grammar specifies the source language. Anattribute grammar augments the context-free grammar with attributes andsemantic functions in order to define a translation from a source languageto a target language. This thesis shows that given an attribute grammarspecifying the translation T from language L1 to language L2, one canautomatically construct the attribute grammar specifying the inversetranslation T{sup -1} from language L2 back to language L1. The INVERTsystem implements the inversion algorithm, employing several specialtechniques to help create efficient inverse specification. After discussingthe theoretical and practical issues of attribute grammar inversion,it is demonstrated how the technique can be used to build source-to0sourcetranslators. To prove the feasibility of the inversion approach to source-to-sourcetranslation, it has been used to generate translators between the programminglanguages Pascal and C.</TEXT></DOC>
