The families of Benjamin Charny, 50, and Yuri Zieman, 49, havebeen notified by the U.S. State Department that Soviet authoritieshave withdrawn objections on national security grounds to allowingthe two men to leave .   Leon Charny said Assistant Secretary of State for Human RightsRichard Schifter telephoned him Tuesday to say his brother'seight-year battle for permission to emigrate may soon be over.   ``I'm grateful, I'm happy and I want him out as soon aspossible,'' Charny said in a telephone interview from his Needhamhome. ``My wish is that no family will have to go through what thisfamily has gone through.''   ``I also got a call from the State Department,'' said Zieman'sdaughter, Galina Khatusky, who emigrated to the United States inJune 1987. ``They told me the Soviets have no objection to myfather's leaving.''   Zieman's daughter, Vera, had written President Reagan appealingfor help in the couple's 11-year wait for exit visas and theReagans considered visiting her home during the recent U.S.-Sovietsummit in Moscow.   The visit reportedly was canceled after U.S. officials werewarned that a presidential stop would doom the family's chances toemigrate.   Charny and and Khatusky said neither of their relatives had beenofficially granted permission to leave. But both said they believetheir release is just a matter of time.   ``I trust the State Department,'' said Khatusky, who lives inBrighton.   The first indications the matter was about to be resolved cameTuesday, when Soviet officials informally notified U.S. and otherWestern diplomats that the Ziemans would soon be granted exit visas.   The word reportedly was conveyed to Secretary of State George P.Shultz by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubynin.   Khatusky said she was told it would take about two weeks for theSoviet Union to formally notify her parents and 12-year-old sister,Vera, that they may leave the Soviet Union.   Zieman, a computer specialist who lost his job when he appliedto emigrate in 1977, worked as a plumber until stricken severalmonths ago by a mysterious ailment that left him with double visionand a loss of balance.   The condition, diagnosed by some Soviet physicians as apotentially deadly aneurysm, or bulge in a cerebral artery, madethe family's quest more urgent because Zieman was warned by hisdoctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in theSoviet Union.   Zieman had been told he is not permitted to leave the countryfor security reasons, though he contends he never had access tostate secrets and has no information that could threaten Sovietsecurity.   ``He has severe brain disorders, we hope he can come here and beexamined properly,'' said Khatusky.   Leon Charny, a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, said his brother has undergone surgery for acancerous growth on his back and recently suffered a heart attack.   He also has what is believed to be benign tumor growing on theback of his neck.   In 1986, the New England Medical Center offerred Benjamin Charnyfree medical care, Leon Charny said, adding that it's ``doubtless''he can receive better medical help here than in the Soviet Union.   Charny, a mathematician who worked for the Institute ofAutomation and Instrument Making 17 years ago, had repeatedly beendenied exit visas on the grounds that he was privy to state secrets.   His brother said a deputy director at the institute hadcontacted his brother Tuesday to inform him he was ``no longerconsidered a person who knows vital secrets, and that was the onlymajor obstacle to his way out.''</TEXT></DOC>
