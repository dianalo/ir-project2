Witcher (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GM GMH WU </CO><IN> TEL ARO TNM </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit said it agreed in principle to buy the Westar satellite system from Western Union Corp. for an amount that wasn't disclosed.    Hughes, a unit of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, said the Westar system includes three satellites already orbiting Earth, a fourth satellite that hasn't been launched, and selected tracking and other equipment.    Analysts estimate the purchase price was less than $100 million and say they doubt the sale will greatly affect Hughes's financial performance.    &quot;I don't think it's going to have a material impact on their sales or earnings one way or another,&quot; said Peter Aseritis, a securities analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;But it'll probably give them some added capacity.&quot;    The space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986 dealt a severe blow to the launch of satellites used for commercial purposes, increasing the value of satellites like the Westar spacecraft already in orbit.    Hughes Communications Inc., a Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft subsidiary and telecommunications concern, already owns and operates three Galaxy C-band satellites in addition to the three Westar C-band satellites Hughes Aircraft now hopes to acquire -- Westar III, IV and V. The Westar satellites, built by another Hughes Aircraft unit, have a 10-year life expectancy and are used primarily to distribute radio and cable television broadcasts.    Westar VI-S, pending approval of the acquisition by the Federal Communications Commission, will be launched in the early 1990s to replace the aging Westar III, said Stephen Petrucci, president and chief executive officer of Hughes Communications. Final sale is also contingent on completing a definite agreement and obtaining approval from the companies' boards.    GM's Class H stock closed yesterday at $54.50 a share, up $2.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is tied to the earnings of Hughes Electronics. </TEXT></DOC>
