In this book, contributors assess the nature of theproblem, focusing on the link between the international debt and soaringoil prices caused by the oil shocks of 1973-74 and 1978-79. The bookexamines three specific debtor countries in three unique situations:Mexico, an oil exporter; Brazil, an oil importer and the largest LDCdebtor; and Israel, an oil importer with one of the highest debts inthe world and unique international assets. Through the three countrystudies, the contributors demonstrate how unexpected fluctuations ininterest rates, commodity prices, and world prosperity compounded thealready existing problems specific to each nation. The authors give specialattention to the effect of oil price swings on a country's debt and itsability to repay. The book also covers additional international financialaspects of the debt problem, such as the new burdens heaped on the U.S.Federal Reserve System, that further complicate management of U.S. monetarypolicy at home. An examination of debt crisis management during its firstfive years leads to an innovative suggestion for successful resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
