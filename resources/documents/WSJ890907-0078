Regulators say that as their files of enforcement actions and investigations continue to thicken, the ranks of firms that deal in the high-risk, low-priced securities are thinning. Already, the heat has become so intense that a number of firms are seeking less-hostile environs.    In a report prepared for a congressional hearing today, the North American Securities Administrators Association says that the number of state penny-stock enforcement actions ballooned 97% from 1987 to 1988; the number of closed investigations, resulting in fines, suspensions or revoked licenses of penny-stock brokers, jumped 51% during that time.    &quot;Americans are being nickel-and-dimed by penny-stock fraud, and it's starting to add up to real money,&quot; John C. Baldwin, president of the securities regulators' group, said in an interview. In the report, the group says penny-stock swindles cost investors at least $2 billion a year and are the &quot;No. 1 threat&quot; to small investors in the U.S.    Penny-stock fraud may be a favorite whipping boy of regulators now, but it certainly isn't a new problem. By the securities administrators' own admission, abuse of penny stocks dates back to the 1940s, &quot;when worthless shares in uranium mine stocks were bought and sold over the counter of a Salt Lake City coffee shop.&quot;    Penny stocks, which are thinly traded and usually sell for less than a dollar, are still traded over the counter, but the industry has grown. Today, there are an estimated 325 firms based in 29 states operating in the $10 billion penny-stock market, the state securities chiefs say. That's up sharply from 55 in less than six locales five years ago.    Many of the 13,000 issues that trade on the OTC market, but outside the computerized Nasdaq system, are penny stocks. To be sure, many of the stocks are issued by legitimate companies and aren't vehicles for stock manipulation. Price quotes for the low-priced issues appear in the &quot;pink sheets&quot; published daily by the National Quotation Bureau.    National regulatory efforts to curb abuses in the penny-stock market heated up last year. The formation in June 1988 of the Florida Penny Stock Task Force -- which includes state regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, federal prosecutors and the Internal Revenue Service -- is one example of the heightened attention accorded the problem by federal authorities. With 31 penny-stock brokerage firms calling the state home, Florida's penny-stock industry ranks as the nation's third biggest, behind New York and Colorado.    As a result of increased pressure, many broker-dealers apparently are on the run. The Florida task force reports that operators who find the state inhospitable are moving to Georgia and other southeastern states. But Georgia regulators last month instituted their own assault on penny-stock manipulators, promising criminal prosecution of certain &quot;serious&quot; violators.    Even penny-stock giant Blinder, Robinson andamp; Co., currently the target of a sweeping enforcement action by Florida officials and a past target of federal securities regulators, reportedly wants to move its headquarters out of Denver to a place where the company won't be &quot;harassed&quot; by regulators and the media, according to reports in Denver newspapers.    Officials of Blinder Robinson didn't return phone calls seeking comment on their plans.    In Florida alone, there were 150 examinations of penny-stock broker-dealers from June 1988 to June 1989 conducted by the Florida Division of Securities, the SEC and the NASD. The agencies' coordinated efforts have led to the closing of about 22 penny-stock brokerage firms in the state, according to a recent report by the Florida task force.    Lawrence Fuchs, Florida deputy comptroller, estimates the task force has saved taxpayers millions of dollars, both by protecting them from unscrupulous operators and eliminating a possible duplication of enforcement efforts.    Despite the recent flurry of regulatory action across the U.S., some observers complain that there haven't been enough jailings yet and that many crooked penny-stock brokers, sanctioned in one state, often open shop in another and begin again.    James B. Cloonan, president of the Chicago-based American Association of Individual Investors, acknowledges that regulators have made some progress, but he laments that they seem unable to &quot;punish these people&quot; the way they do other securities laws violators. He speculates that difficulties arise because &quot;there's no paper trail and it all comes down to one person's word against another's&quot; in many penny-stock transactions.    Lawrence Iason, regional administrator of the SEC in New York, acknowledges some &quot;problems&quot; at the state level, but emphasizes that &quot;if someone is barred from the industry by the SEC, he's out -- nationwide.&quot; He and other federal regulators say efforts are under way to encourage the participation in penny-stock cases of agencies with the power to put offenders behind bars.    Mr. Fuchs in Florida counters that the best way to avoid penny-stock fraud is for investors to just say no. &quot;The best protection for investors,&quot; he says, &quot;is never to get involved in the first place.&quot;    ---@ Clamping Down @ Actions by 50 state securities regulators involving penny stocks @ 1987 1988 @ New investigations 357 737 @ Resolved cases 262 395 @ Consumer reports of fraud 1,767 2,660 @ Involvement by the Securities and Exchange Commission @ 1988 1989* @ Penny-stock actions @ undertaken 25 46 @ Consumer complaints @ to SEC 1,510 2,462 @ *Through June 30 @ Source: North American Securities Administrators Association </TEXT></DOC>
