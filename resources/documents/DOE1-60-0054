The first solutionis mixed with an oil solvent to produce a second solution by introducinga metered stream of solvent into the first solution, and pumps the secondsolution into the well, and mixes the crude oil to be produced with thesecond solution to form an emulsion, and continuously producing the formedemulsion.</TEXT></DOC>
