Itdescribes equipment design features of the three major suppliers anddiscusses 68 plants in detail. Steam generator degradation mechanismsinclude intergranular stress corrosion cracking, primary water stresscorrosion cracking, pitting, intergranular attack, and vibration wearthat effects tube integrity and causes leakage. Plugging, sleeving heattreatment, peening, chemical cleaning, and steam generator replacementsare described and regulatory instruments and inspection guidelines fornondestructive evaluations and girth weld cracking are discusses. Thereport concludes that although degradation mechanisms are generally understood,the elimination of unscheduled plant shutdowns and costly repairs resultingfrom leaking tubes has not been achieved. Highlights of steam generatorresearch and unresolved safety issues are discussed. 21 refs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
