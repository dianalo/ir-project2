The 7 1/8% bonds, due March 5, 1992, were priced at 101 1/4 to yield 6.82%.    Although the weight of last year's $6.58 billion in gross international borrowing has damped investor enthusiasm for the country's paper, Danish officials assert that this year will be different.    &quot;We estimate that our gross borrowing needs will be significantly lower in 1987 than they were in 1986,&quot; said Niels-Erik Sorensen, director for foreign borrowing at the Ministry of Finance.    He predicted gross borrowing would decline, largely because the current account deficit is expected to narrow. But a bond manager at lead underwriter Nomura International Ltd. said, &quot;We're not denying it's going to be difficult&quot; to sell the bonds.    In the secondary market, Eurodollar bonds were unchanged in lackluster trading.    In other currencies, the European Investment Bank floated the equivalent of $161 million of European currency units of 7 5/8% seven-year Eurobonds. An ECU represents a basket of European currencies. The bonds were priced at 101 1/2 to yield 7.43% and are largely aimed at Swiss investors.    Lead underwriter Swiss Bank Corp. International said there were 17 other Swiss banks in the 22-member management group.    While some investors were concerned about this composite currency's performance ahead of a possible realignment of the European Monetary System, dealers said, EMS shake-ups often proved neutral for the ECU, as gains by the stronger currencies generally balanced the losses by weaker ones. </TEXT></DOC>
