Thehigher it gets the faster it goes. There is no stop button.   The situation recalls the hair-raising serials that once were astaple of early movie houses, in which each sequence ended in awfulperil followed in a week by impossible escape.   But there may be no escape from this difficulty unless thecorporations involved are even more creative than directors ofthose old movies, and certainly more ingenious they have been todate.   The subject is the total income _ both salary and bonus _ of topcorporate officers. Only a couple of decades ago it was measured inthe low six figures, more recently in seven digits, and now onoccassion in eight numbers.   One of the problems is that executive bonuses _ General Motorsgranted $157 million in stock bonuses last year _ are almost alwaysbased on good short-term performance.   The situation can reach an acute stage when the industry iscyclical, which the automotive industry is. That is, years of bigsales, high profits, rising stock prices and the like alternatewith off years.   There is rarely a price to be paid for off years. But there isalmost always a reward to be gained for good years.   Professor Eugene Jennings, professor of business at MichiganState University and a confidential adviser to corporate chiefs andboards, says the ever-rising incomes are developing into a publicrelations problem for companies.   In lean years, he observes, some executives are given bonusesbased on the justification that money will motivate them to producefat years. When the fat years arrive their bonuses are justified asin the interests of equity.   Equity in this instance means it is fair that executives becompensated for enhancing shareholder values. But when that andother explanations cannot be made, it is sometimes argued thatbonuses are needed to retain valued people.   When those reasons fail, market parity is used. It means that anexecutive of one company certainly cannot be compensated lower thanthat of a comparable executive in a similar company. It is saidthat market wages must be paid.   There is some evidence that in lean years boards do indeed grantfewer or smaller salary and bonus increases.   But, says Jennings, ``as soon as one of these justifications canbe made, increases in bonuses occur of such proportion as to makeup for ground lost in the lean years.''   He is convinced that if there were no lean years total incomeswould be smaller. But, he observes, lean years set the foundationfor subsequent large bonuses.   He maintains ``there is no doubt in my mind and in minds of manychief executives I have advised that you could pay one-half thesalaries and bonuses that America pays to corporate officers andstill get competent management.''   The problem is that no one company can make the cuts andsurvive. ``It has to be across the board,'' and that might mean anational conference of chiefs to decide on controls, a prospect hedoes not think will take place.   Illustrating the difficulty in making changes, General Motorslast year announced that future bonuses would be tied to long-termperformance. One year later it contradicted itself, announcing bigshort-term bonuses.   While growing as a public relations problem, he believes therising incomes have not yet reached a critical stage in terms ofpublic concern, but that they will. The totals will grow swiftly asthe amounts involved are compounded.   And no one company, he says, has access to the ``stop'' button.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs April 21</NOTE></DOC>
