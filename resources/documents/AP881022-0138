Even if Marcos and the government don't work out a deal thatwould spare both sides the expense of a trial, it could easily be ayear or more before Marcos would face a jury.   Federal prosecutors allege Marcos embezzled more than $100million from the Philippine government and used the money to buythree buildings in New York City. The main charge carries a maximumprison sentence of 20 years.   ``Paradoxical as it may seem, Imelda and I welcome theopportunity to show the whole world that these allegations ofdishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by our accusers.We are confident that we will be vindicated,'' Marcos said in astatement released Saturday by his spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad.   As part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense, Marcos'lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pre-trialdiscovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive reviewof administration records for any documents suggesting Marcos wasoffered assurances he wouldn't be prosecuted if he came to thiscountry.   Whether any such records exist, the check for them and thediscovery process in general will take a long time.   In Honolulu on Friday, Marcos attorney Richard Hibey referred tothe matter indirectly, saying President Reagan was responsible forMarcos being brought to the United States, that Marcos consideredhimself loyal to Reagan and expected some loyalty in return,including safe haven in this country.   Marcos was president of the Philippines for 20 years and a closeally of a succession of U.S. administrations until he fled intoexile in February 1986.   Hibey also said his client's health will be a major factor inthe case.   Although he said Marcos, 71, is willing to attend hisarraignment either in Honolulu or New York by Oct. 31, where Marcosand his wife would plead innocent, Hibey described Marcos' state as``frail.''   ``I am personally concerned ... that he may not be physicallyable to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope andmagnitude,'' said Hibey.   Trinidad, the Marcos spokesman, said Saturday that ``even at theexpense of his life, if he has to go to New York, he'll go. Themost important thing is not life, but honor and he will defend hishonor any place.''   In the 2{ years Marcos has lived in Hawaii, he has been treatedfor a variety of illnesses, including chest pains and an eyeailment.   Marcos' lawyers showed no enthusiasm with the deal the JusticeDepartment offered prior to his indictment, possibly pointing to adrawn-out process of negotiation in the future.   Calling the pre-indictment offer ``a set of non-negotiable''demands, Hibey said Marcos had been instructed to accept or rejecta deal that would have required him and his wife to plead guilty tofelony racketeering charges and testify against others with noassurances Marcos would not be jailed.   And Marcos' lawyers are showing no reluctance to publiclydispute information being put out by the government about the case.   One Marcos attorney, John J. Tigue, flatly rejected the notionthat Marcos' lawyers hadn't responded to the Justice Department'sdemands that he enter a guilty plea. Federal sources said Thursdaythat the lawyers hadn't responded by a 5 p.m. EDT deadline. Tiguesaid there had been miscommunication, that the deadline had been5:30 p.m. and that the Marcos' lawyers had responded in time,rejecting the offer. ``Of course we wouldn't let the deadline goby'' without responding, said Tigue.   Marcos decision to face indictment rather than plead guilty to acrime also raises another intriguing question: How much politicaldamage might he inflict?   A State Department cable that leaked out earlier this monthtouches on the potential problem.   It says, in part, that an indictment may prompt a vindictiveMarcos to ``seek to involve and embarrass'' U.S. and Philippineofficials by making allegations of improper or illegal conduct,``however unfounded'' in an attempt to adversely affect relationswith the current Philippine government. The cable doesn't elaborate.   In another development, a congressman confirmed early Saturdaythat Marcos recently was subpoenaed to testify before a Housesubcommittee.   Rep. Dante B. Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, said he signed the subpoena after it wasrequested by the Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee.   Fascell declined to discuss what the panel wants to questionMarcos about, but The Virgininian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star,newspapers in Norfolk, Va., reported from their Washington bureausthat it involves long-standing allegations that Marcos funneledmillions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaignsof Reagan.   In Honolulu, television station KHON quoted Hibey as confirmingthat the subpoena had been served. ``I understand it's for hisappearance today (Oct. 21) in Washington,'' Hibey told the station.``That's not going to happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
