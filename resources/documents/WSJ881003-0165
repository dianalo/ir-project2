Do they need new equipment and machinery? New factories? The answers depend largely on the outlook for business, and this time, as usual, the answers aren't crystal clear.    Up to August, the economy had been growing more swiftly than economists had expected. Then, suddenly, activity slowed down. The unemployment rate edged upward, the rise in payroll jobs slowed, and other statistics were at best lackluster. Was the economic expansion, now nearly six years old, finally fading out?    The answer, if you care to believe most economists, is no, or not yet, anyway. But that by no means ends the uncertainty. The analysts who predict the economy have been changing their views this year with unusual frequency -- and sharpness. After the stock-market crash last October 19, many forecasters saw an early recession, and nearly all of them expected a major slowdown.    The pessimism wasn't limited to private economists. Analysts at the Federal Reserve also were worried, so the Fed poured more money into the economy and pushed down interest rates. By last May, however, both private and government economists realized the early-recession fear had been a false alarm. The economy was rebounding with unexpected strength, so the markets and the Fed began to worry about inflation.    The Federal Reserve allowed an increase in the federal funds rate, the fee banks charge on loans of reserves to one another. Through June and July, however, the central bank kept pumping money into the economy. By August the inflation fears had grown enough that the central bank raised the discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks, and modestly slowed the growth of the money supply.    As August statistics came in through September, the numbers looked quite weak. Notably, the unemployment rate edged upward and the rise in payroll employment slowed. So economists have changed their forecasts again. As usual there is no unanimity, but a majority now believes that there will be only a modest recovery from the August slowdown. That, in their view, will permit the expansion to continue through 1989.    According to analysts at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the August statistics &quot;suggested a slower pace of economic activity and have helped to ease the markets' fears of an overheating economy.&quot; If the Federal Reserve believes the economy is adjusting to a slower pace, it might reduce its upward pressure on interest rates, an action that could help to prolong the expansion.    This possibility is one factor persuading analysts to push back their forecasts of recession.    So far, however, many business executives and investors seem unconvinced that smooth, if somewhat slower, growth will materialize. David H. Resler, chief economist of Nomura Securities International, comments that the markets in recent weeks have been plodding along with little direction and low volume. &quot;There is evidently little conviction about the direction of the economy or of interest rates,&quot; he says.    So what do business planners do? They either must make their own forecasts or use someone else's. And the evidence is that economists' forecasts are not as bad as sometimes painted. For a number of years Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, has been polling 51 academic and business economists early each month. The accompanying table compares the analysts' early-October forecasts with the actual outcome in the following year.    The forecasters didn't do badly. The big error came in October, 1982, when the analysts failed to realize they were already in a recession and forecast moderate 2.2% growth in the inflation-adjusted gross national product in 1982, completely missing the deep downturn.    Uncertainty is likely to continue to plague forecasters and executives. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week failed to agree on a new price-fixing plan, so oil prices will be a wild card for some time to come. The first presidential debate didn't establish a clear winner, or even indicate which candidate would be better for business.    Such uncertainty, of course, isn't new. It helps to explain why business capital spending in the past half-dozen years has been mainly for new and more efficient equipment, projects that promise a quick payoff. Less money has gone for long-term building programs.    If economists are to be believed, however, this might be a good time for businesses to add to capacity.    ---                   GNP Consensus Forecasts -                 FORECAST                    PCT.
