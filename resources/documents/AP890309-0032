The bill passed Wednesday, a major part of congressionalDemocrats' domestic agenda, also would require companies with 50 ormore employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extendedtime off to take care of ailing parents.   And it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leavefor the workers' own serious illness.   In each instance, the only direct cost to the employer would beto continue whatever company-paid health benefits that were in forceat the time the worker requested leave.   However, many private and public employers, including theNational League of Cities, oppose the measure on grounds it would beoverly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workersrequesting such extended leaves even though the direct financialcost might be minimal.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>US Defends Decision To Deny Visas To Three Mayors</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is defending itsdecision to bar mayors from Panama, Cuba and Nicaragua fromattending a drug conference in New York, saying none of thesecountries can be counted on to cooperate in drug control efforts.

Philip A. Dye of Caldwell, Idaho, told the consumer protectionsubcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that agencystaff members acted in an underhanded fashion in their investigationof his product and refused to discuss possible safety improvements.   His problems, he said, showed that members of the commissionshould be ``equipped with business knowledge and experience, andmost of all, what is lacking now, common sense.''   A safety commission spokesman declined substantive comment, but acommission member defended the agency's effort to get the productoff the market, suggesting the device ``probably is against everyknown product standard in the civilized world.''   Dye and his wife operate P andamp; M Enterprises, producing the ``WormGett'r,'' a device to drive worms to the earth's surface.   It is made up of two, six or 12 metal prongs inserted into theground and connected to a common two-wire, 120-volt AC householdcircuit. The current flowing into the ground forces worms desired byfishermen to rise to the surface.</TEXT></DOC>
