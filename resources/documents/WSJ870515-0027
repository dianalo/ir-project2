The dollar's failure to rally on the merchandise trade report followed several days of exchange-rate stability. The latest decline revived the persistent negative mood in the currency market toward the U.S. currency.    &quot;We haven't been able to sustain the highs of the past few days, so in my mind the dollar will go lower,&quot; Peter Wild, vice president, foreign exchange, at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. in New York, said.    Immediately after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade gap narrowed to $13.6 billion in March from $15.1 billion in February, the dollar started slipping. In late New York trading, it stood at its lows for the day, down 0.7% to 139.25 Japanese yen from 140.25 Wednesday and down the same percentage to 1.7825 West German marks from 1.7948.    In early trading Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 139.25 yen.    The British pound climbed 0.6% to $1.6800 from $1.6696. Traders said the Bank of England intervened in London trading, selling sterling for dollars to limit the pound's rise.    Traders were divided over why the dollar fell, but there was agreement that the March trade report contained some discouraging news for the U.S. Some said they were concerned about the record trade deficit with West Germany in the month despite the dollar's huge drop against the mark over the past two years.    Japan's report Wednesday of a record $5.15 billion April trade surplus with the U.S. also cast a cloud over yesterday's news out of Washington.    &quot;People noted that March may have improved, but April was really lousy if you look at the Japanese numbers,&quot; Jack A. Kessler, vice president, foreign exchange, at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said.    The Japanese Finance Ministry also may have contributed to the negative atmosphere for the dollar by publicly trying to persuade financial institutions in Tokyo not to sell the U.S. currency.    &quot;In my eyes that can't be too positive for the dollar,&quot; Mr. Wild of Bank Julius Baer said. He said the government probably wouldn't &quot;go begging&quot; executives of major Japanese banks and insurance and securities companies not to sell dollars unless Japan's central bank &quot;was running out of ammunition to intervene&quot; in the currency market.    Addressing an upper-house session in the Japanese Parliament yesterday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa scolded Japanese financial concerns that contribute to the dollar's decline through speculative selling.    &quot;I would like (them) to think about the fact that their conduct is hampering Japan's economy, especially the efforts of small and medium-sized businesses, and causing unemployment problems,&quot; he said.    Japan opposes a further decline in the dollar because it would harm Japanese exporters and holders of dollar-denominated investments. A weaker dollar tends to make Japanese and other imported goods more costly for Americans and creates foreign exchange losses for holders of U.S. bonds and stocks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for May delivery climbed $5.80 an ounce to $464.20 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $464.75 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Thursday, May 14, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
