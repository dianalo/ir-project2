Such a discount has occurred onlytwice in the past decade -- in 1983 and 1985 -- and accordingto some analysts, it's about to happen again.   Platinum's price has fallen faster than gold's over recentweeks on reports of growing platinum supplies and theperception of weakening industrial demand. At yesterday'sclose, the premium of platinum over gold had shrunk to just$11 an ounce from an average of $100 last year.</LP><TEXT>   After falling most of the past week, platinum for Aprildelivery recovered a bit yesterday, rising $3.70 an ounce to$387.20. February gold dropped 70 cents an ounce to $376.40.   On previous occasions when platinum and gold pricesreached parity, platinum &quot;snapped back like a rubber band,&quot;said Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan andamp; Co., a preciousmetals consulting company based in Santa Monica, Calif.   In February 1988 platinum and gold prices reached paritybut the premium of platinum over gold went to $140 an ouncein April, and to $180 an ounce by November, according to theNew York Mercantile Exchange, where platinum futures aretraded.   &quot;There's no question it will snap back and snap back veryquickly&quot; if it happens this time, Mr. Kaplan added. But willit sustain that higher, post-rebound price? &quot;The answerdepends on how long the recession lasts,&quot; he said.   William O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch,predicts platinum will fall to a discount below gold soon,and over the next month will trade at a $20-an-ouncediscount. &quot;There's no inherent reason why it should trade ata premium, other than history,&quot; he said. In fact, the surplusof supply over demand in platinum dictates that it shouldn'ttrade at a premium to gold, he added.   The surplus of platinum supplies will grow to more than200,000 ounces in 1991, from about 80,000 to 90,000 ounces in1990, Mr. O'Neill said. That surplus is expected to expandover the next few years as demand fails to keep up with theincreased production from South Africa, he said. The SovietUnion may also step up platinum sales to generate much-neededhard currency, he added.   Nina Lipton, research manager of Platinum GuildInternational, an industry group, said the perception thatthe current recession will damp demand for platinum inindustrial applications is driving the price down. But, sheargued, the perception is wrong.   There hasn't been a drop-off in demand for platinum, shesaid, citing reports that demand increased in 1990. Whileit's true auto makers are producing fewer cars, they areputting more platinum into each car, she said. Moreover,platinum is being used in other environmental applicationssuch as ground water purification and pollution controlequipment for power plants and factories, she said.   &quot;The market is reacting to a perception that could turnout to have very little link to reality,&quot; Ms. Lipton said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Oil markets are still jittery over developments inthe Middle East war, but petroleum futures prices roseyesterday on expectations that the latest weekly report onU.S. oil inventories would be bullish. Crude oil for Marchdelivery increased 89 cents a barrel to settle at $21.85 onthe New York Mercantile Exchange. The April crude was up 73cents a barrel to $20.89. February heating oil ended futurestrading 2.15 cents a gallon higher, and February gasoline wasup 2.72 cents a gallon. But then, after the close of futurestrading, the American Petroleum Institute released its latestweekly report, which wasn't as bullish as expected. Althoughit showed that inventories of distillates, including heatingoil, had declined in the latest week by 3.6 million barrels,about in line with expectations, there were big buildups ingasoline and crude oil. Inventories of gasoline increasednearly 3.3 million barrels while those for crude oil were upnearly 3.2 million barrels.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of hog futures contracts sankamid weakening demand by grocery store chains for pork. Thedemand for pork usually eases in late January as retailersshift their promotions to fish for the Lenten season. Intrading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the February hogcontract settled at 53.25 cents a pound, down 1.02 cents.Last week, hog prices climbed amid a tight supply of hogs bigenough for slaughter. Prices of pork belly futures contractsdropped. Traders have been uneasy about rumors that ameat-related concern had accumulated a sizable stake in thepork bellies available for delivery against the Februaryfutures contracts. Such a position would possibly increasethe difficulty of pork belly traders to meet their deliveryobligations. Traders said that such rumors aren't unusualbecause it is relatively easy to control a large amount offrozen pork bellies, which are used to make bacon. A ChicagoMercantile Exchange spokesman said the exchange has a policyof refusing to comment on rumors about &quot;market situations.&quot;                                                                                                          COTTON: Sales to Asia Monday night pushed futures pricesto highs. Cotton for March delivery rose 1.27 cents a poundto 79.19 cents, above the contract's previous lifetime highof 78.43 cents. The May contract also set a lifetime high.&quot;Cotton remains the lone bull in the futures arena. And thatwill be for quite some time to come,&quot; said Thomas Mueller, ananalyst with Merrill Lynch. As competing countries such asIndia and Turkey begin to deplete their cotton supplies,buyers are increasingly turning to the U.S., Mr. Muellersaid. Until the crop from the Southern Hemisphere becomesavailable in a couple of months, the U.S. will have the onlysupply available, he added. The cotton dealers who made theAsian sales came into the market buying contracts to hedgetheir cash-market transactions, which pushed prices upinitially. Heavy computer fund buying in the last fiveminutes of trading caused the market to explode, said ErnestSimon, a cotton specialist with Prudential-Bache Securities.He foresees prices rising to 80 cents, with a &quot;very goodpossibility it will go higher.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
