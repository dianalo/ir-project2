At Puerto Princesa's bustling market white-breasted sea eaglesare sold for less than $100 and talking mynah birds for $30.   Immigration from other islands, which has grown by an average of5 percent since the start of the decade, has reduced the percentageof Palawan's original settlers _ including at least seven nativetribes _ to less than half of the population, now estimated at500,000.   The influx has created serious ecological problems, among themthe slash-and-burn farming methods of poor settlers and the vigorouscollection of wildlife for sale. Wealthy logging concessionaireshave been accused of plundering the province's timber resources.   Mountains run the length of the province's main island, on whichare found 232 _ or one-fifth _ of the country's wildlife species,environmentalists say. Many of the species are yet to be classified.   Palawan, the Philippines' largest province, about 150 milessouthwest of Manila, is also home to about 1,500 species of plantswhose medicinal and food properties have not been fully examined.   More than 1,700 islands offer 2,000 miles of coastline. Watersteem with fish. The provincial environment office says nearly 50million metric tons of fish were caught in 1987 alone.   Human fossils 22,000 years old have been found in the province'sTabon Cave.   The Haribon Foundation, a conservationist group, has gathered amillion signatures since last year to pressure the government intodeclaring Palawan a protected area.   In a recent letter to President Corazon Aquino, Haribon'sPresident Maximo Kalaw urged a ban on commercial logging andcollection of wildlife in Palawan. Haribon also urged theestablishment of communal forest areas for island residents.   Mrs. Aquino referred the petition to the Department ofEnvironment and Natural Resources.   ``The issue in Palawan is not only about conservation but aboutsocial equity and sustainable development for generations ofFilipinos to come,'' Kalaw said.   Nearly 70 percent of Palawan's land area of 3.7 million acres isforested. Haribon blames loggers, whose concessions cover one-fifthof forest lands, for denuding an estimated 46,930 acres of forestsyearly.   The destruction of natural forests has resulted in soil erosion,siltation and flooding in the southern part of the province,district foresters said.   Officials say they lack resources to protect the forests. MarianoVillanueva, provincial environment and natural resources officer,says he has only 179 guards, each responsible for 9,880 acres offorest.   The illegal use of cyanide and dynamite by fishermen threatensfish stocks and the coral offshore. Villanueva says his agentscannot arrest fishermen suspected of using cyanide because they haveno equipment to detect the poison.   Aside from cyanide and dynamite, local fishermen use a techniquecalled ``muro-ami'' fishing, in which they drive poles into thecoral to divert fish into their nets.   Brig. Gen. Napoleon Angeles, the regional military commander, hasseized boats and other marine equipment to discourage illegalfishing.   But he opposes a logging ban for fear it would result in higherunemployment and possibly fuel the Philippines' years-long communistinsurgency, which has just recently made its way to Palawan.   ``I am for a sustainable use of natural resources so people mayeke out some kind of livelihood program for themselves,'' saidAngeles, a member of the provincial development council.   A British consulting firm, Hunting Technical Services, and localagencies have developed an environmental plan for the PalawanIntegrated Area Development Project.   The plan recommends a 20 percent reduction in the area authorizedfor logging each year to prolong the cutting cycle and protectagainst erosion.   Currently, timber companies may operate on about 12,350 acres ayear. The plan calls for stricter monitoring of these companies.   Officials have also stepped up the campaign against illegallogging.   Although Palawan was declared a game refuge and bird sanctuary in1967, trading of wildlife continues. Officials recently raided thepublic market and retrieved an eagle, green parrots, porcupines andmynah birds.   They arrived too late to save a leopard cat _ it had died in acage _ and a rare bearcat, which they found hanging from a nail.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs June 14</NOTE></DOC>
