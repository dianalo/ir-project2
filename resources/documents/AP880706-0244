Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed received a written messagefrom Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, thanking him onbehalf of the Tehran government for condolences Kuwait offeredafter the U.S. Navy shot down the Iran Air A300 Airbus on Sundaywith 290 people on board.   An official Kuwaiti statement said Velayati's message alsoexpressed condolences ``for the loss of a number of ... (Kuwaiti)nationals in the incident.'' Thirty-eight non-Iranians were amongthe passengers.   The statement said Sabah sent a reply to Velayati thanking Iranfor its condolences.   ``Sheik Sabah underscored the gravity of such an incident whichnecessitates investigation that would determine its causes and itscircumstances, and prevent its repetition,'' the statement said.   The messages contained no direct reference to nearly 8-year-oldwar between Iran and Iraq.   Iran has often accused Kuwait of actively aiding Iraq in thewar. In the past years it fired missiles into Kuwaiti territory andmenaced this tiny country's oil shipments in the gulf.   Iran also has been accused of backing Shiite Moslem saboteurs,blamed for bombings in Kuwait over the past five yeras.   The radical Al-Rai Al-Aam newspaper meanwhile urged Iran not toretaliate for the incident.   It said that ``such an error cannot be ruled out in area whoseland, sea and air are jammed by military equipment, civilianaircraft and commercial ships. ... The threat of revenge against asuperpower will not serve the cause of peace or end tension butrather it will lead to another series of violence andcounterviolence.''   In the United Artab Emirates, the Dubai-based, English-languagenewspaper Khaleej Times said: ``Iran appears to be in no need toundertake any adventurist actions. The moral and propaganda gainfor it has already been enormous. ... Iran can easily sit back andwatch the Americans squirm with embarrassment as they try toexplain how one of their most sophisticated ships failed todistinguish between an Airbus and an F-14 fighter.''</TEXT></DOC>
