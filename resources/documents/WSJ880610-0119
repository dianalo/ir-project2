The divisions have, in effect, split the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into three camps on the eve of its midyear conference, which opens here tomorrow afternoon.    &quot;No predictions,&quot; replied a senior OPEC official who was asked about the possible outcome and length of the meeting. &quot;It's the most bewildering situation I've seen,&quot; he said.    Most of the 13 oil ministers will arrive today, with some possibly showing up as late as tomorrow morning. But comments of the two early arrivals, the oil ministers of Venezuela and Kuwait, underscore the depths of the controversies over production quotas and other issues.    Venezuela's Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, who has been leading a push to coordinate production cuts with exporters outside the cartel in order to trim the world oil glut, told reporters that contacts are being maintained with the non-OPEC group. He said that several non-OPEC producers, which in April offered to cut their oil exports if OPEC also would reduce output, still are &quot;very willing&quot; to &quot;cooperate in stabilizing the market.&quot;    But Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah of Kuwait, asked his view on OPEC production cuts for the second half, replied: &quot;Good lord, cuts? We are entering winter (in the second half).&quot; It is understood that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, previously instrumental in blocking an OPEC counteroffer to the proposal submitted by the non-OPEC group, will request an increase in the cartel's production quotas for at least the third quarter.    Some Persian Gulf members of OPEC are said to be content with the current price of $15 to $16 a barrel for their oil, while others want to try to get it back up to the official $18 level. But there are widely differing views on how this might be accomplished, and some are concerned that the price could fall further in the third quarter, unless production is cut back.    Even the Arab members of OPEC are split over production levels. Algeria and Libya are expected to side with Iran in calling for sharp reductions in output, at least for the third quarter.    Another group probably will argue to hold quotas at current levels -- described by one delegate as a &quot;rollover&quot; of last December's agreement. That agreement set quotas for the first half of 15.1 million barrels a day for 12 members.    Iraq is excluded because it won't accept a quota less than the 2.4 million barrels a day of its enemy, Iran. Iraq's output is estimated at 2.6 million barrels a day. And some other OPEC members are producing beyond their quotas. Total production of all 13 is around 18.6 million barrels a day, higher than indicated demand for OPEC oil.    OPEC's own economic experts are far apart in their estimates of demand for the second half. A majority of OPEC's Economic Commission Board, which meets prior to ministerial conferences, estimates demand for OPEC oil to be only 17.6 million barrels a day for the second half. A minority, made up of representatives from the Persian Gulf Arab states, looks for demand of 18.9 million barrels a day.    Industry estimates, generally, are toward the lower end of this range, and oil traders expect prices to decline if OPEC production creeps higher in the third quarter. &quot;The fundamentals are weak and if anything is holding the market up, it's euphoria over (a possible) OPEC/non-OPEC agreement,&quot; said Mark Walker, president of Houston-based Transworld Oil U.S.A. &quot;An increase in quotas by OPEC would be highly negative.&quot;    As of last night, only one representative from the non-OPEC group, Oman's oil minister, was expected to be in Vienna during the OPEC meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
