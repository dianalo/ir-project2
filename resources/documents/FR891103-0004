Because the changes in part 309 ofthe FDIC's regulations occasioned by the enactment of FIRREA merely involvechanges of nomenclature, the notice and public participation provisionsof the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) are not applicable.The FDIC finds, for the same reason, that it is in the public interestto dispense with the 30-day deferred effective date requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In the grant of new regulatory authority to the FDIC over savings associationsformerly under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, FIRREA hasamended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to define banks and savings associationscollectively as ``depository institutions.'' <T3>See</T3> section 204(c)(1), Pub. L. No. 101- 73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989).Thus, ``depository institution'' has been substituted in part 309 whereverthe term ``bank'' appears, with a few technical exceptions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required under section 553of the Administrative Procedure Act or any other law, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601-602) does not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 309</ITAG>Authority delegations (Government agencies), Disclosure requirements; Freedomof information, Privacy.For the reasons set out above, 12 CFR part 309 is amended as set forthbelow.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 309_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</ITAG>1.
