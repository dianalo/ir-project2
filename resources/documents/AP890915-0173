Israel's top leaders on Friday reportedly clashed for the secondtime this week over the 10-point plan and on President HosniMubarak's efforts to sponsor a Palestinian delegation for talks withIsrael.   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir emerged optimistic afterFriday's session, telling Israel radio:   ``There are some chances for moving our peace process, not onlyby these 10 points ... There are other developments that encourageus. I don't think we are facing a deadlock. There is a movement andwe are discussing further developments with our American friends,Egyptian friends, and I hope that we will get results.''   Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny presented the plan to theIsraeli officials, said an aide to Labor Party leader Shimon Peres.Israel had been saying it cannot comment on a proposal it has notbeen officially presented with.   In the occupied West Bank, troops shot and killed two Palestinianyouths in clashes with stone-throwers in Nablus, Arab hospitalofficials said. The army confirmed both deaths but said soldiers didnot open fire where 12-year-old Tarkek Said Tuffah was killed. Arabreports said Tuffah was shot by an army sniper.   The two deaths raise to 570 the Palestinian death toll in the21-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation. Forty Israelishave also died in the violence, and 114 Arabs have been killed byfellow Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with Israeliauthorities.   A meeting of Labor's Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabinwith Likud's Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens ended in sharpdisagreement, Israel radio reported.   Egypt's plan stipulates acceptance of the U.S-supported formulaof trading territory for peace and participation of the 140,000residents of annexed east Jerusalem in the Palestinian electionsoffered by Israel.   Both ideas are opposed by Likud but supported by Labor.   Mubarak also proposed that the 12-member Palestinian delegationinclude two Arabs deported from the occupied territories.   The proposal is intended to satisfy Israel's demand to talk onlyto Palestinians from the territories and the PLO's insistence thatPalestinians living abroad be included in any talks.   ``Deportees are not exactly outside Palestinians. ... I would notbe quick to reject this possibility,'' Peres said in an interviewwith the English-language Jerusalem Post.   A Labor official speaking on condition of anonymity said Laborministers agreed in a meeting Thursday night to negotiate with sucha delegation. He said the party saw ``no need to stay in thegovernment'' if there was no progress in peace talks.   Labor apparently agrees to negotiate with deportees as a way ofbypassing direct negotiations with the Palestine LiberationOrganization, but Likud officials see no difference.   Israel officially refuses to negotiate with the PLO, calling it aterrorist organization bent on Israel's destruction.   Transport Minister Moshe Katzav, of the right-wing Likud, toldthe daily Yediot Ahronot that anyone seeking ``to accept the 10points wants to break up the national unity government,'' which wasformed in lengthy negotiations following November 1988 elections.   Shamir wants to resolve the deadlock prior to Arens' and Peres'visits to the United States next week. Peres is scheduled to meetwith President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III duringhis 10-day stay, and Arens plans to see Baker.</TEXT></DOC>
