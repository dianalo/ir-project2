In June, a federal appeals court threw out theracketeering and fraud convictions of Mr. Wallach and his twoco-defendants, Rusty Kent London and Wayne Chinn. The appealscourt ruled that prosecutors deprived the defendants of afair trial by relying on a witness who lied to the jury.</LP><TEXT>   At a hearing in federal court in Manhattan, Judge RichardOwen, who presided over the trial, approved the decision todrop the racketeering charges. The government's use of theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act againstMr. Wallach had been criticized by defense attorneys whocontend the law wasn't meant to apply to political-corruptioncases.   &quot;It was always a preposterous RICO charge,&quot; said DennisRiordan, an attorney in San Francisco for Mr. Wallach.   Prosecutors couldn't be reached to comment on why theracketeering charges were dropped.   At the request of both prosecutors and the defense, JudgeOwen agreed to separate the case into two trials. One trialwill be held for Mr. Wallach, who is accused of takingillegal payments from Wedtech, a defunct defense contractor,in return for promising to use his influence with Mr. Meeseand other federal officials. Messrs. Chinn and London, whoare accused of fraud, will be tried together. The two menwere hired as financial consultants to Wedtech after Mr.Wallach introduced them to officers at the company.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss told Judge Owen thatthe government wants to begin the new trials as soon aspossible &quot;to get this case back on track.&quot; Mr. Weiss, whoalso prosecuted the previous case, said the government wantsto retry Messrs. Chinn and London first.   Although Judge Owen said the trials could begin as earlyas next March, attorneys for the defendants said they hopethe appeals court will toss out the new prosecutions before atrial even begins.   Mr. Riordon said a motion will be made to dismiss the caseon the ground of double jeopardy, arguing that the defendantswould have been acquitted had the prosecutors not relied onthe witness who committed perjury. The appeals courtpreviously said that the U.S. attorney's office should haveknown that the witness was lying during his testimony.   Although the perjured testimony wasn't about the allegedwrongdoing, the appeals court said it could have influencedwhether the jurors believed the witness.   Judge Owen refused the defense attorneys' request that thecase be reassigned to another judge. The defendants hadalleged on appeal that Judge Owen was biased in favor of theprosecutors.   ---   LEGAL-MALPRACTICE claims are restricted by IllinoisSupreme Court.   The court ruled that a client can't sue a lawyer to recoupeconomic losses allegedly caused by the lawyer's negligence.Instead, the court said, malpractice claims should be treatedas breach-of-contract claims, a holding that could limitwronged clients to recovering only the legal fees they paid.   The ruling &quot;is really unconscionable,&quot; said John J.Lowrey, a Chicago lawyer who argued against the restrictionin a friend of the court brief on behalf of the IllinoisTrial Lawyers Association. &quot;If a lawyer makes a mistake, or adoctor, or an architect, he ought to pay for it,&quot; he said.   The case was filed by Dorothy J. Collins of Bloomington,Ill., against lawyer Charles Reynard, who was retained tonegotiate the sale of Ms. Collins's business. In her suit,Ms. Collins alleged that Mr. Reynard failed to include aclause in the sales contract that would protect her right tothe property if the buyer defaulted on the contract. Thebuyer did default, and the business was foreclosed on by thebank that financed the purchase.   Ms. Collins alleged that Mr. Reynard had been negligent,and she sought to recover the $48,000 she would have receivedunder the sales contract. Mr. Reynard argued that a previousIllinois Supreme Court ruling in a product liability disputeprohibits the recovery of economic losses in a negligencecase.   The court, in a recent opinion, agreed with Mr. Reynardand said his client couldn't pursue a negligence claim justbecause her &quot;commercial expectations&quot; weren't fulfilled. Thecourt did say that negligence claims could be brought againstattorneys by third parties, such as beneficiaries of a will.Otherwise, the court said, malpractice disputes should beconsidered within the laws governing contracts.   Ms. Collins' lawyer, Duane D. Young of Springfield, Ill.,called the decision &quot;an oddity&quot; that &quot;essentially equated thepractice of law with any other commercial enterprise.&quot; Mr.Young said he will ask the court this week to reconsider thecase. Mr. Reynard, now state's attorney in McLean County,Ill., couldn't be reached for comment.   The majority opinion, written by Justice William F. MoranIII, drew a disbelieving dissent from Chief Justice Ben K.Miller, criticizing the use of a &quot;novel ground&quot; to overturn a&quot;long-standing common-law theory of recovery.&quot;   Justice Miller went on to suggest that unless the courtrevised its theory on economic losses, &quot;prospective clientswould be well advised after today's decision to obtaincounsel before they retain counsel.&quot; (Collins vs. Reynard,Illinois Supreme Court, Springfield, Ill.).   ---   MILKEN AND SEVERAL ASSOCIATES are sued by a Floridathrift.   American Savings of Florida, F.S.B. filed suit in federalcourt in Miami against Michael Milken, his brother Lowell andothers linked to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., alleging thatMr. Milken and his colleagues &quot;corruptly obtained influenceand control&quot; over American Savings.   The thrift is a unit of Enstar Group Inc., a Montgomery,Ala., retailer and provider of financial services. AmericanSavings has been trying to turn itself around after sufferingsevere problems related to, among other things, loans it madeto Enstar. In early November, the thrift sued some formerofficers, directors and others, alleging that severalinter-company transactions enriched Enstar to the detrimentof American Savings.   In the latest suit, American Savings asserts that Mr.Milken, Drexel's former junk bond chief, and others, throughthe junk-bond market, gained a measure of control over boththe thrift and Enstar and caused the two companies to &quot;makeinvestments in junk bonds that were unsuitable and/oroverpriced.&quot;   A spokesman for Mr. Milken dismissed the action as&quot;another bogus lawsuit blaming Michael Milken for things hewasn't responsible for.&quot; Referring to a suit by First CapitalHoldings Corp. against Mr. Milken that was dismissedWednesday, the spokesman added: &quot;Like that lawsuit, we areconfident this suit will also be thrown out of court.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
