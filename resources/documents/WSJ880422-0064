Per-share earnings for 1987 were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split in December 1987. Revenue for the first quarter ended March 27 increased 11% to $797.1 million from $715.8 million.    Los Angeles-based Times Mirror attributed the higher earnings to a 79% increase in operating profit from its cable television operations and the absence of losses from the Denver Post, which Times Mirror sold in December. Sales of the company's timberlands and its Times Mirror Press resulted in pretax gains of $22.5 million, or 12 cents a share, after taxes.    Operating profit of the newspaper publishing group fell 8.3% for the quarter as a result of sluggish advertising demand and increasing newsprint prices, plus increased newsprint usage and costs related to marketing programs. Operating profit of the broadcast television group fell 29%. </TEXT></DOC>
