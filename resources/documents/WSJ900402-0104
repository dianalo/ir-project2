So long as theSoviets need -- and are able to get -- Western financing,they are more apt to show forbearance in dealing withsensitive political problems, such as Lithuanian secession.They will be reluctant to endanger their ties with the West.But if their Western financing dries up, their behaviorbecomes more problematic.   On the other hand, if the West continues to finance theSoviet economy, its needs could become a serious drain onworld capital markets. Pouring money into non-productiveenterprises is bad banking, and the Soviet command economy issinking ever lower from an already low level of production.</LP><TEXT>   If the Soviets are unable to pay their debts to Westernbanks they will add to an already sizable pile of troubleddebt -- that run up by less developed countries and the U.S.savings and loan industry, for example. Bad debt is economicwaste, and thus a drag on the world economy. Such waste feedsinflation and inhibits economic growth. Use of tax money byWestern governments to finance the Soviets also makes littlesense. By raising tax burdens, that too would slow productivegrowth.   In short, the Soviets, always a military threat, now arebecoming an economic threat as well. A nation stretchingaround nearly half of the northern part of the globe issinking into an economic abyss. Its 280 million people arenot producing enough to provide themselves with adequatenecessities, let alone contribute anything to the world'ssupply of capital and wealth. Rising discontent furtherdiminishes productivity.   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin said last weekthat there is no sign of an easing of the decline in energyand industrial output caused by strikes and politicalturmoil. In the first two months of this year, oil productionwas off 4% from a year earlier and coal production off 6%.Earlier it had been reported that man-days lost to strikesand conflicts rose to 9.1 in the first two months from 7.3 ayear before. It is not entirely clear what that statisticmeans but it seems to indicate that the U.S.S.R. lost some20% to 25% of its labor capacity, obviously a serious matter.   The Soviets have had a continuing debate over whether theyshould borrow more in the West to finance purchases ofconsumer goods. As Keith Bush of Radio Liberty wrote on thesepages recently, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov last yearappeared to exaggerate the size of the Soviet external debt,perhaps to discourage further borrowing to fill storeshelves. But he now appears to have lost the debate.   Nikolai Petrakov, Mikhail Gorbachev's chief economicadvisor and the lead designer of yet another planned economicreform, dropped a hint about foreign borrowing in a recentinterview with Interfax, a semi-official Soviet news agency.He stressed how important it will be for President Gorbachevand his new cabinet to &quot;retain the confidence of thepopulation&quot; as the new reform inflicts economic pain. He waspresumably referring to layoffs and maybe higher prices.   &quot;It would be good, of course, if to achieve this we couldmake use of foreign credits offered to us on easy terms,&quot;said Mr. Petrakov, adding that the Soviet Union &quot;ought toenter all the international economic organizations.&quot; In otherwords, the Soviets would like to get into any organizationthat has money to lend.   That hint is being confirmed by other reliable sources inWestern Europe. They say the Soviets are gearing up for aborrowing offensive. The question will be whether to financeor not finance their consumption needs.   At least one Westerner of some note may already have madeup his mind on that question. U.S. Treasury Under SecretaryDavid Mulford told a Senate hearing a few days ago that theU.S. would not join the proposed European Bank forReconstruction and Development (EBRD) if the Soviets aregiven full borrowing access. Western private banks also aretaking a more jaundiced view of Soviet credits, mainlybecause of mounting Soviet debt payment arrears, which aresaid to be approaching $1 billion. A 500 Deutsche mark ($300million) Soviet bond issue met with a cool reception on theLondon market in January. Keith Bush quoted a West Germanbanker as saying that the Soviet credit rating haddeteriorated more in a few weeks than it had in the previous20 years.   The Soviets insist that their credit problem is simplycaused by too many Soviet enterprises and banks having beenturned loose to borrow in the West. Many did so withoutadequate means to service their debts. The cure, according tothis argument, is a recentralization of Soviet borrowing. Butthat doesn't sound much like economic reform. Centralmanagement is the primary source of Soviet problems.   Mr. Mulford obviously has a good point. If the EBRD is tobe set up primarily to finance redevelopment of the newlyliberated countries of Eastern Europe, why on earth should itfinance Soviet consumption? Development financing presumesthat there will be a return on the investment. But theconnection between putting goods on Soviet shelves andachieving economic reform in that country is a tenuous one atbest.   Some use humanitarian arguments for feeding the Soviets.Undernourishment clearly has become serious at the lowestincome levels of Soviet society. It worsens as shortages andinflation grow. At the first meeting of his new cabinet,President Gorbachev stressed that the food situation was thebiggest problem facing his government.   But why should the West shed tears for a regime that stillis spending huge amounts of money to build weapons and to runa world-wide empire? Merely cutting off Fidel Castro from theSoviet dole or closing down the huge Soviet base at Cam RanhBay, Vietnam, or scrapping one of the aircraft carriers underconstruction, could feed a lot of Russians.   Soviet militarism is part of the equation. If the Sovietsno longer have anything to lose in the way of Westernfinancing, will they become more aggressive toward the West?That argument suggests, however, that the West should simplybribe the Soviets to become good guys, a doubtful enterpriseeven if it had a chance of succeeding. What in fact willprobably happen is that markets will make the decision. Asthe Soviets begin to look more like bad risks, they will getless financing. From that, maybe their badly underdevelopedknowledge of how markets work will be improved.   ---   Correction                                                                                                          The Global View column on this page Monday, &quot;Who Will Paythe Bill for Russia's Decline?&quot; used some inaccuratelytransmitted statistics regarding man-days lost in the SovietUnion. The correct numbers are 9.1 million man-days lost inthe first two months this year, compared with 7.3 million forthe full year 1989.   (WSJ April 3, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
