One consumer group, however, said the plan could lead to thefirst increases in long-distance rates, particularly on nights andweekends, since the 1984 breakup of ATandamp;T.   The 3-0 commission decision, which FCC Chairman Dennis Patrickcalled a milestone in federal telephone regulation, will replaceATandamp;T's so-called rate-of-return rules on July 1 with a plan thatwould tie long-distance prices to productivity gains and the rate ofinflation.   The vote, postponed in January under pressure from Congress,followed more than two years of rancorous debate between Patrick andcritics on Capitol Hill and consumer groups who said the new planmay slow the 4-year-old decline in long-distance rates.   But Patrick said it was time to change the 1960s-era system underwhich ATandamp;T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs.Patrick said that system gave ATandamp;T incentive to pad expenses.   ``We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that wascrafted in the 1960s and to use that system in the 1990s and beyond.It is simply outdated,'' he said.   ATandamp;T said the decision was ``a step forward for ATandamp;T and goodnews for our customers.''   Patrick made a number of revisions to the plan to assuagecongressional concerns, including additional safeguards forresidential and small-business users.   One of Patrick's critics was Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee ontelecommunications and finance.   Markey said the plan ``still does not contain sufficient consumersafeguards to ensure that residential telephone customers willfairly share in rate reductions which should result from newtelephone technologies. I fear that the days of real long-distanceprice reductions for the average residential caller may be over.''   Markey said he will co-sponsor legislation requiring the FCC toprovide price and cost data with which Congress can measure theeffect of price caps on consumers and ATandamp;T's competitors.   Currently, ATandamp;T can earn about 12 percent on its investment.Under the new plan, overall rates must rise 3 percentage points lessthan the rate of inflation _ for example, a 1 percent increase ifthe rate of inflation were 4 percent.   Rates would be set on three broad categories of ATandamp;T service:residential and small business; 800 services; and all other businessservices.   To make sure big business does not get all the benefit of ratecuts, rates for residential and small-business prices must rise atleast 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation, the FCCsaid.   Within the residential-small business category, prices ofparticular services such as night and weekend calling could increaseno more than 4 percentage points above the overall percentage changein rates. For example, if inflation was 4 percent and overall ratesrose 1 percent, night and weekend calls could rise 5 percent.   Gene Kimmelman, executive director of the Consumer Federation ofAmerica, said ATandamp;T has lowered long-distance rates faster underrate-of-return regulation and that the new plan is ``hardly animprovement for the public'' since long-distance rates conceivablycould go up in some categories.   ``It will possibly give you the first real long-distanceincreases since the breakup of ATandamp;T,'' Kimmelman said.   The plan also limits how much ATandamp;T can lower its rates, whichcommissioners James Quello and Patricia Diaz Dennis said caused themconcern. But Dennis said she supported ``this grand experiment'' ofprice-cap regulation.   Quello said he reluctantly supported the limits, or floors, onhow much prices can go down and that he hoped such restraints couldbe removed quickly. But he said the plan overall was a``precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit thepublic.''   ATandamp;T said it was ``mystified that the commission finds itnecessary to continue treating ATandamp;T differently by limiting ourability to reduce prices in such an extremely competitive market.''   Patrick said local telephone companies will be placed under somekind of rate cap plan on July 1, 1990. The commission ordered localcompanies to submit pricing plans in that regard by May 17.   Although state utilities commissions regulate phone companies'local rates, the FCC regulates how much the companies chargelong-distance carriers to plug into their local networks. Thoseaccess charges account for a big part of long-distance costs.   BellSouth, one of the seven regional companies created in the1984 breakup of ATandamp;T, said the commission ``took an important stepto benefit consumers in a substantial way'' but that savings wouldhave been greater had the commission applied the new rules to localcompanies this year.   MCI Communications Corp., one of ATandamp;T's chief competitors in thelong-distance market, said it supported the price cap plan forlong-distance carriers but said local phone companies should stillbe strictly regulated because they have monopolies on local service.   But United States Telephone Association President John Sodolskisaid: ``For the full benefit of price caps to be realized, localexchange carriers must be free to employ it as well.''   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., introduced legislation earlier thismonth to prevent implementation of price caps until Congress canstudy the proposal more thoroughly.   Cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan thatuniversal telephone service and subsidies for high-cost telephoneservice in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distancerates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.</TEXT></DOC>
