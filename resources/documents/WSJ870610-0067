Winch, chairman and president of the 86-year-old Minster Machine. In 1984 and 1985, &quot;we discounted hell out of prices, in some cases 25% or 30%, and we couldn't get orders,&quot; he says. &quot;Now we're getting back some market share.&quot;    As Minster Machine's experience indicates, U.S. capital goods producers are finally enjoying some sunshine after spending the first two-thirds of the decade in the shade. Though the sky is far from cloudless because of the marketing and distribution inroads foreign competitors made during the period, U.S. companies are benefiting from the decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies, among other things.    &quot;The weaker dollar is starting to work,&quot; says a spokesman for Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria, Ill.-based construction equipment maker that sells nearly half its products outside the U.S. &quot;American machines are easier to buy all around the world.&quot;    The dollar's decline is especially important to U.S. capital goods makers because their principal foreign competitors are in Japan, West Germany, Great Britain and other leading industrial countries where currencies have appreciated sharply against the dollar in the past two years.    The improved competitive position of U.S. capital goods producers, executives say, will enable them to make the required investment in product development and production facilities to remain world-class competitors.    In addition to aid from the cheaper dollar, domestic capital goods makers are benefiting from a modest strengthening of U.S. and some Western European capital goods markets, particularly for computers and electronically controlled equipment. To be sure, the 1986 federal tax law reduced investment incentives in the U.S., but many capital goods makers say most of the tax bill's adverse impact was felt last year, and it affected buildings more than equipment.    While demand has weakened for capital goods in Japan, few U.S. companies sold much there anyway. U.S. capital goods sales to Korea, China and other Pacific Basin markets are rising. And although Brazil, Mexico, the Middle East and other developing areas aren't the booming markets they were in the late 1970s, sales in some of those markets are improving a little, equipment producers say.    U.S. capital goods makers are also benefiting from major restructurings of the past five years. They've closed old plants and slashed capacity to adjust to a smaller market. Many have begun buying more parts from outside suppliers that can make them cheaper. Most have cut salaried employment and generally streamlined their organizations to cut costs.    For instance, Case IH, the Racine, Wis.-based unit of Tenneco Inc., says it cut the cost of a backhoe-loader used in construction by $1,000 and expects further savings. The Burlington, Iowa, plant that makes the $40,000-plus machines was extensively overhauled, including installation of computer-controlled flexible manufacturing systems, says John F. Boylan, executive vice president, manufacturing. Direct labor costs have declined by 20%, he says.    &quot;We've improved materials flow substantially,&quot; he says, which pares inventory investment. Instead of being warehoused, wheels with tires already mounted, engines, transmissions and other major parts now go directly from delivery trucks to the assembly area, he adds. Similarly, castings go from delivery truck to the flexible manufacturing system for machining, then by conveyor to a paint shop and finally to the assembly area, again without going into storage.    By year's end, Case IH expects to turn its inventory 20 times a year, a major improvement in efficiency from the previous high of 13 turns, Mr. Boylan says. Only a few years ago, six or seven inventory turns a year was considered satisfactory.    But things are not all sunny. Foreign competitors used the period when they had a price advantage to build a strong U.S. distribution network. Also, they were able to introduce their goods to U.S. companies that hadn't previously bought foreign-made equipment.    Now, foreign firms are opening U.S. plants to supply that distribution system with everything from construction machinery to machine tools. Foreign-owned U.S. plants, even when they use a lot of foreign-made parts, reduce the impact of the declining dollar.    Meanwhile, some U.S. capital goods makers continue to be burdened with surplus capacity and out-of-date plants. Finally, the dollar could rebound as suddenly as it fell, some economists and executives say. If the Japanese and major European economies turn sour, the U.S. would again look like the only promising place to invest, increasing demand for dollars and raising the U.S. currency's value.    Nonetheless, the outlook is a lot brighter than it was during the 1982-85 period, when U.S. capital goods producers were dealt a one-two punch. First, the 1982 recession and liquidity problems in developing countries combined to shrink world capital goods markets. Caterpillar's sales in Latin America, for example, dropped to $266 million in 1983 from a $903 million high two years earlier.    When, as markets recovered, the dollar rose against most industrialized nations' currencies, it allowed foreign competitors to snare a larger share of world markets for goods from bulldozers to office copiers. U.S. suppliers simply couldn't meet prices of Japanese, German and other foreign competitors in the U.S. or abroad.    That deadly combination almost knocked out the U.S.'s traditional strong surplus in capital goods trade. In pre-recession 1981, U.S. exports of capital goods (excluding autos) totaled $81.6 billion, more than double imports of $36.7 billion. Last year, however, exports of $78.2 billion only slightly exceeded capital goods imports of $75.7 billion.    Last year, more than 30% of capital goods purchased in the U.S. were imported, says Adrian T. Dillon, chief economist for Eaton Corp., the Cleveland-based producer of truck parts and electrical and electronics products. In 1980, imports made up only 13% of capital goods sales in the U.S.    &quot;We got beaten up about as badly as you can,&quot; says Minster Machine's Mr. Winch. The privately held concern doesn't disclose exact figures, but Mr. Winch says sales fell a &quot;painful&quot; 55% between 1980 and 1983, with exports sliding to a low of 2% of sales.    The dollar's decline, however, &quot;has dramatically helped us,&quot; he says. Exports have improved considerably, and many foreign contenders, he adds, &quot;are getting a little too expensive for the U.S. market.&quot; Sales this year appear likely to top the 1980 record by 12%, with exports accounting for about 25%, he says. &quot;We're selling in Korea, Japan, England and Italy, probably in that order,&quot; he says.    Companies that export about half their output, such as Nordson Corp., are also faring much better. The Westlake, Ohio-based maker of equipment to apply adhesives, coatings and sealants grimly hung on to its foreign sales organization during the 1983-85 period, even though there was little profit abroad.    This year, Nordson is earning a payback. Net income in its fiscal first half ended May 3 more than doubled to $12.1 million on a 28% rise in sales to $99.9 million. And the company has been &quot;taking advantage of the opportunity to take some interesting price actions (reducing prices in local currencies in Japan and Europe) to increase market share,&quot; says William P. Madar, president and chief executive officer.    Not all capital goods makers are faring as well, however, since some foreign producers have raised prices in the U.S. far less than the currency change would indicate. Prices of Japanese-made lathes and machining centers haven't risen at all, U.S. producers complain.    A look at the statistics indicates how tough competition from imports remains for many U.S. capital goods makers. Prices of imported capital goods rose at an annual rate of 4.4% in the first quarter, says Douglas R. Cliggott, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. However, they had declined 6.4% in 1983, 5.5% in 1984 and another 4.6% in 1985 before creeping up a paltry 1% last year.    As import prices rise, U.S. producers have the option of raising their own prices to fatten profit margins, or holding prices about level and increasing market share.    &quot;There is a temptation for U.S. producers to raise prices&quot; as the dollar's value declines, says Leonard G. Friedel, vice president of the Boston Consulting Group. &quot;Just by raising prices, management can claim that they turned the company around when all they did was ride the wave of higher prices that began in Japan or Europe.&quot;    However, Mr. Friedel says his clients are using the current period &quot;as a window in which they can move to rapidly repair what was a deteriorating competitive situation.&quot; In addition to winning current orders, he says, companies that resist the temptation to raise prices &quot;will discourage the Japanese from accelerating the rate at which they are setting up manufacturing capacity in the U.S.&quot;    Cross andamp; Trecker Corp., for one, believes &quot;we'll get a better return for shareholders if we increase sales than if we move up prices,&quot; says Richard T. Lindgren, president and chief executive officer of the Bloomfield Hills, Mich.-based machine tool company. Higher volume and improved productivity are the best way to increase profit, he contends. </TEXT></DOC>
