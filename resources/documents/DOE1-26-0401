In 1987OPEC restored Government Sales Price (GSP), Petroleum export of OPEChas decreased from 15.77 million bbl/d in the middle of 1986 to 13.45million bbl/d in the middle of 1987 and the contracts geared to marketconditions have decreased radically, being replaced by those of GSP.The contracts of GSP are a fairly unstable outlet for OPEC to adjustto market conditions, and their ratio in the total contracts varies amongmember states. Saudi Arabia and Iran heavily depend on the GSP contractsand are extremely influenced by weakening of market conditions. In spiteof the restoration of GSP, the ratio of the GSP contracts in total petroleumsales is as low as 37% and varies among member states, resulting in agreat difference of sales stability among them. This means that the presentsituation of OPEC in view of its marketing policy is still just the sameas before the heavy fall of prices. (7 figs, 7 tabs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
