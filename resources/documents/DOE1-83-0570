The saturation scheme ofthese sum rules is determined on the basis of experimental data. Twoseries of baryon resonances with arbitrary isospins I and spins J=I+1/2and J=I-1/2 are predicted. A general solution for vertices of interactionof these resonances with {alpha}/sub i/ is found. Predictions for couplingvertices B/sub {alpha}(sub i)/B'(B, B'={Lambda}, {Sigma}, {Sigma}/sup*/) agree well with the experiment. It is shown that the condition ofsum rules saturation by minimal number of resonances brings to saturationschemes resulting from experimental data. A general solution of sum rulesfor scattering of {alpha}/sub i/ reggeons on {gamma} and {Omega} hyperonsis analyzed. 27 refs.; 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
