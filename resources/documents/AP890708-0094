U.S.-backed guerrillas based in Pakistan claimed to haverecaptured a garrison near the eastern city of Jalalabad that theylost Thursday.   Also Saturday, government-run Radio Kabul said guerrillas blastedthe capital with a barrage of rockets, killing eight civilians andwounding four.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the Afghanarmy backed by a tank regiment advanced two miles and was 32 milesfrom the border.   ``Our brave army forced the opponents to retreat, and we areadvancing to destroy more bases of the enemies,'' he said on thefourth day of a government offensive.   Amani said government troops were in complete control ofJalalabad and surrounding hills, giving them a strategic advantageover the rebels.   ``We are fortifying the area with heavy weapons and we plan tomarch further,'' he said.   The spokesman said Afghan government troops also carried outsearch and destroy operations in about half a dozen villagesSaturday in Nangarhar province, whose capital is Jalalabad.   The troops seized a large quantity of weapons including 2,400mines, one tank, three armored personnel carriers and bags ofexplosives, he said.   Jalalabad, on the main route from Kabul to Pakistan, is 75 mileseast of the Afghan capital and 45 miles west of the border.   Moslem guerrillas in Pakistan claimed they stalled the governmentoffensive Friday after losing the strategic Samarkhiel garrison onthe outskirts of Jalalabad. On Saturday, the guerrillas' AfghanInformation and Documentation Center based in Peshawar and theAfghan News Agency both reported the insurgents recaptured thegarrison.   Fasle Akbar of the information center said two Soviet-made Scudmissiles landed near the border town of Torkham on Saturday, killing10 guerrillas and injuring 25. However, he said guerrillas shot downa government fighter jet and helicopter gunship on Friday.   Qaribur Rehman Saeed of the Afghan News Agency said theguerrillas, known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, wereallowing government troops to advance.   ``Mujahedeen will not block their way,'' said Saeed, addingguerrillas skilled at hit-and-run tactics would be well-placed inmountain hideouts around Torkham, where a key guerrilla base islocated at the foot of the Khyber Pass.   The guerrillas have tried since March to capture Jalalabad, thecountry's fifth-largest city. It would provide them a seat for aguerrilla government they formed in Pakistan.   Lt. Gen. Manoky Mangal, military governor of Nangarhar province,on Friday said at least 2,000 insurgents had been killed and 4,000wounded in the operation around Jalalabad, and gave governmentcasualties as 26 dead.   Both sides customarily exaggerate enemy losses and minimize theirown.   The Moslem insurgents attacked Jalalabad on March 7 in theirfirst major assault after the withdrawal of Soviet military forcesfrom Afghanistan was completed Feb. 15.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to back thegovernment. The withdrawal was mandated under a U.S.-mediated accord.</TEXT></DOC>
