Copies secured throughmandatory deposit under section 407 of the Copyright Act would be addedto the collections of the Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room.The Copyright Office received seven comments on the proposed regulation.While some of the comments praised the broad goals of the Machine-ReadableCollections Reading Room, all expressed reservations with the proposedregulation as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The Copyright Office has studied carefully the comments that were submitted.For reasons detailed in this announcement, the Copyright Office has adoptedas final, the proposed regulation without change. We are republishing asAppendix B the entire Best Edition Statement, including the additonal materialregarding deposit of machine-readable copies.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Background</ITAG>Under section 407 of the Copyright Act of 1976, title 17 of the UnitedStates Code, as originally enacted, the owner of copyright, or of the exclusiveright of publication, in a work published with notice of copyright in theUnited States was required to deposit two copies (or, in the case of soundrecordings, two phonorecords) of the work in the Copyright Office for theuse or disposition of the Library of Congress. Effective March 1, 1989,the requirement that a work subject to mandatory deposit contain a copyrightnotice was eliminated. This change was made in Public Law 100-568, theBerne Convention Implementation Act of 1988.The deposit is to be made within three months after publication in theUnited States. Failure to make the required deposit does not affect copyrightin the work, but may subject the copyright owner to fines and other monetaryliability if the failure is continued after a demand for deposit is madeby the Register of Copyrights. As a qualification of these general provisions,section 407 also provides that the Register of Copyrights ``may by regulationexempt any categories of material from the deposit requirements of thissection, or require deposit of only one copy or phonorecord with respectto any categories.''Relying on this authorization, the Copyright Office, with the approvalof the Librarian of Congress, established regulations governing mandatorydeposit at 37 CFR Chap. II, andSection;andSection; 202.19, 202.20, and 202.21.Section 202.19 establishes the standards governing mandatory deposit ofpublished copies and phonorecords for the Library of Congress. Section202.20 concerns the required deposit when application is made for registrationof a copyright claim with the Copyright Office under section 408 of title17, U.S.C. andSection; 202.21 allows deposit of identifying material in lieuof copies or phonorecords in certain cases. In addition, the Library ofCongress published its Best Edition Statement specifying the required depositin instances where two or more different editions were published.When these regulations were first promulgated in 1978, machine-readablecopies were not widely marketed to the public at large. For this reason,the Library of Congress decided to exempt all works published solely inmachine-readable formats from mandatory deposit. For purposes of copyrightregistration deposit, for such works generally can be satisfied by submittingidentifying material comprising the equivalent of the first and last 25pages of the source code in the case of a computer program, or the first25 and last 25 pages of a database.Since the time these policies were adopted, great changes have occurred.As a result of the popularity of the personal computer, computer softwareand databases are in wide public demand. In response to these public needs,the Library has established a Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room.The Reading Room provides public access to two categories of importantmachine-readable copies.The first category is standard data in microcomputer machine-readable formthat traditionally has only been available in print form (encyclopedias,census figures, standard reference publications, etc.). With the developmentof computer technology, many standard reference materials have become availablein whole or in part in machine-readable form. The Library desires to providepatrons access to these machine-readable reference sources.The second category is computer software in microcomputer machine-readableform. The Library makes software available in the Reading Room for purposesof review and study. The software is not acquired to perform the specifictasks for which the software was created. For this reason, utilizing thesoftware collections of the Reading Room will not serve as a substitutefor the purchase of a software package. Preview and study of the softwarein the Reading Room, however, may influence a researcher's selection ofa package for purchase.The Library is interested additionally in developing its software collectionsfor archival purposes. As a general rule, a software package has a relativelyshort life. Therefore, acquisition and retention of software in a centralizedlocation is vital for the use of future scholars who wish to study thecomputer revolution from an historical perspective.Under the proposed regulation published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 9, 1988, andSection; 202.19 governingmandatory deposit would be changed in two places. Section 202.19(c)(5)would limit the exemption for machine-readable copies to automated databasesavailable only online. Section 202.19(d) would be modified by adding anew subparagraph (vii) allowing for deposit of only one machine-readablecopy, except where a copy-guard system is used. In the latter case, twocopies would be required.In addition to changes in the deposit requirements, the Copyright Officeproposed a new section in the Best Edition Statement covering machine-readablecopies. IBM and Macintosh formats would be designated as the formats desiredby the Library of Congress. In implementing mandatory deposit for machine-readablecopies, the Register would demand only copies of works appearing in theformats designated in the Best Edition Statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Summary of Public Comments</ITAG>Seven comments were received on the proposed regulation. Four commentswere submitted from trade associations, two comments were received frommajor computer manufacturers, and one comment was received from a law firm.1<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 The law firm held the mistaken belief that the proposedregulation would repeal present registration practices with respect tocomputer programs. This is not the case.The Information Industry Association (IIA) criticized the proposed regulationas overbroad, and endorsed, in its place, reliance on a voluntary system.IIA urged that the regulations provide restrictions on the uses patronscould make of machine-readable copies, and asked whether applicable licensingrestrictions would be respected. Questions were raised concerning the scopeof the exemption for databases available ``only online.'' Finally, IIAasserted that differing deposit requirements for mandatory deposit andcopyright registration posed a problem for the industry.The American Association of Publishers (AAP) criticized the proposed regulationfor failing to restrict copying, lending, or electronic dissemination.The AAP suggested that the extent licensing terms commonly applicable tomachine-readable works would be respected was also unclear. We were alsoasked to clarify the applicability of the ``online'' exemption to works``principally'' distributed online. Finally, AAP suggested recasting ofthe Best Edition Statement.The Computer Software and Services Industry Association (ADAPSO) doubtedthat the Library's proposal to prohibit patrons from bringing in diskettesfor purposes of downloading would be workable. ADAPSO also questioned whetherthe support services made available by publishers to licensees would beprovided in the Reading Room. ADAPSO contended that the proposed regulationshould be tabled in favor of a voluntary program.The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association (CBEMA) urgedthat the proposed regulation be recast to exempt all machine-readable worksexcept IBM and Macintosh formatted material. CBEMA further believed thecriteria in the Best Edition Statement should be clarified. Finally, CBEMAsuggested a sunset provision in order to permit a Library-industry reviewof developments concerning the Reading Room.A major manufacturer of personal computers expressed support for the broadgoals of the Reading Room. It urged, however, that the limitations to IBMand Macintosh formats be placed in the regulations. It additionally believedthat the criteria specified in the Best Edition Statement were misleading.Another large manufacturer of computer equipment urged that a voluntarysystem be established instead of implementing mandatory deposit. It urgedthe following steps be taken: (1) The regulations provide an exemptionfor works requiring the utilization of a password; (2) stringent securitymeasures be adopted; (3) the regulation be narrowed to exclude materialwhich can not be used by the Library; and (4) the regulations be simplifiedas regarding revisions, and harmonized with deposit for registration purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Final Regulation on Mandatory Deposit of Machine Readable Copies</ITAG>a. <T3>Basic decision. </T3>For the first eleven years of the current CopyrightAct, the Library of Congress has not exercised the authority to compeldeposit of works published only in machine-readable formats.In order to advance the services of the Machine-Readable Collections ReadingRoom, however, the Library has determined that it is necessary to implementmandatory deposit at this time. While the commentators have uniformly expressedsupport for a voluntary system, the Library has attempted through meetingsand letters to create a voluntary system and these attempts have not succeeded.Before publication of the proposed regulation, the Library sponsored ameeting with industry leaders to discuss the activities of the ReadingRoom. At that meeting industry spokesmen endorsed establishment of a voluntarysystem. Unfortunately, follow-up letters sent by the Library produced nodonations. Mandatory deposit serves as an important source of acquisition for theLibrary of Congress. In order to provide effective public service, theMachine-Readable Collection Reading Room must have available copies ofsignificant works. Exercise of the mandatory deposit authority is a logicaland reasonable means for securing these materials. In passing the CopyrightAct of 1976, Congress clearly intended the Library to exercise its mandatorydeposit authority in a reasonable way to enhance the collections of theLibrary for the good of the public. Since 1870, copies secured through copyright deposit have augmented thecollections of the Library of Congress. While under the present copyrightlaw mandatory deposit is not a condition of copyright protection, compliancewith demands for mandatory deposit remains an obligation of those who benefitfrom the copyright system.Commentators expressed criticisms that the proposed regulations were ``overbroad''or ``beyond what the Library could use.'' Commentators also expressed supportfor greater restrictions on the materials that could be demanded by theLibrary. The Copyright Office issues demands only for works desired to be addedto the collections of the Library. Demands are not issued for works whichare of no use to the Library. As a result, the universe of published workssubject to mandatory deposit has always been far greater than the worksactually demanded. These policies will be applied to machine-readable copies.Determination of materials appropriate for acquisition has always beenthe sole responsibility of the Library. In the fast changing environmentof works available in machine-readable formats, narrow-based policies wouldquickly become obsolete. The Library needs the flexibility to adjust thekinds of formats subject to mandatory deposit in response to changing acquisitionsneeds. For these reasons the Copyright Office declines to exempt broadcategories of machine-readable works from mandatory deposit. Nevertheless,as discussed below, the Library and the Copyright Office reiterate thatfor the forseeable future, only IBM and Macintosh formats will be demanded.By this basic decision to remove the present exemption for works in machine-readableformats, the public receives notice that these formats_except for on-linedatabase not available in disk or other hard-copy formats_are potentiallysubject to mandatory deposit.b. <T3>Restriction to IBM and Macintosh Formats. </T3>The major restrictionin the demand policies of the Library with respect to deposit of machine-readablecopies is the limitation to IBM and Macintosh formats. This limitationis not expressed in the regulation, however, but rather in the format designationsof the Best Edition Statement. At present, hardware available in the Reading Room limits access to IBMand Macintosh formats. For this reason alone the Library will not proceedwith demands for material which can not be utilized by the Reading Room.The Library contemplates securing additional hardware to expand the formatsusable by the collections. When this occurs, the Library will amend theBest Edition Statement to expand the designated formats, and the CopyrightOffice will publish notice of the change in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>This policy is far more favorable to the depositorsthan an unqualified regulation.Commentators expressed support for designating formats in the regulation,but this policy would unduly hamper the Library's ability to acquire copiesin the fast-changing environment of machine-readable works. We declineto establish narrow-based regulations which will quickly become obsoleteas a result of changes in the computer industry. The alternative wouldbe to remove the present exemption and specify a general deposit standard,such as ``disks'' as the preferred medium, followed by tape formats, etc.The Library elects, instead, to limit its demands to the narrow formatsdescribed in the Best Edition Statement.c. <T3>Restrictions on Uses by Researchers. </T3>The Machine-Readable CollectionsReading Room has been established by the Library: (1) To provide accessfor research purposes to data and program software in microcomputer machine-readableform; and (2) to build and maintain a national archive of data and programsoftware in microcomputer machine-readable form.In order to utilize the collections of the Machine-Readable CollectionsReading Room, all potential researchers must register and be interviewed.All machine-readable materials are stored in a secured area, and only staffmembers handle disks.In order to protect materials in the collections from copying, the Librarydoes not permit researchers to insert their own disks into the disk drivesof the computer. Researchers' use of the machines is closely monitoredby staff to ensure that downloading does not occur. The Library has onorder special disks that can lock disk drive slots. The securing of thesespecial disks will simplify the monitoring task. Additionally, the Librarydoes not permit the photocopying of computer manuals that accompany depositedcopies.The Machine-Readable Collections Reading Room does not lend machine-readableworks, nor participate in interlibrary loans of such material. There isno capability for researchers to transmit materials electronically outsideof the Reading Room. All applicable licenses are available for review toinform researchers of user restrictions. Several commentators urged that restrictions on copying be placed in CopyrightOffice regulations. Due to the ease of copying, machine-readable worksare often the subject of abusive reproduction practices. For this reason,the Library has adopted the aforementioned security measures to ensurethat such abuses do not occur within the Library of Congress.The Library concedes that no system is foolproof. It is important to remember,however, that most machine-readable works are sold without any securityagainst copying other than legal prohibitions. Of machine-readable copiesdistributed by copyright owners, the copies maintained within the collectionsof the Library of Congress will be among the most secure. The Library isconfident that the security measures undertaken in the Reading Room willprevent the collections from becoming a source of access for illegal reproductionactivities.d. <T3>The ``Only Online'' Exemption. </T3>Several commentators questionedthe scope of the ``only online'' exemption. Specifically they questionedthe status of ``hybrid'' databases where the database is made availableon CD-ROM with software included that provides access to the more up-to-dateonline version of the database. Additionally, we were asked to clarifywhether databases distributed to a small number of vendors for purposesof offering online service would be entitled to claim the exemption.The Library intends to secure through mandatory deposit machine-readableworks which are publicly offered for sale or lease. In the case of ``hybrid''databases, the Library will seek deposit of the CD-ROM. Clearly, this isa work which is not ``only online.'' The Library will not demand depositof the updates available online. However, once the updates are incorporatedinto a revised CD-ROM, the Library will seek deposit of the revised CD-ROM.As to databases distributed to a small number of vendors for purposes ofoffering online service, several considerations are raised. The Librarydoes not anticipate pressing demands where distribution of copies is genuinelyrestricted to special clients. However, the leasing of copies does constitutepublication within the meaning of the copyright law, and works with a highprice will naturally have relatively few sales. Decisions in these instanceswill be made on a case-by-case basis.e. <T3>Machine-Readable Copies Requiring Special Authorization. </T3>In thepreamble to the proposed regulation, we stated that ``the Library doesnot intend to demand software that requires the utilization of a passwordor other special authorization.'' The comment letters revealed that thisstatement was unclear.In utilizing the mandatory deposit procedures, the Library intends to acquirecopies of material generally offered for sale or lease to the public. Copiesthat are genuinely restricted to special clients will not be sought. Factorsrevealing whether a distribution is genuinely restricted are face-to-facedealings and contractual provisions specifically tailored to the requirementsof both parties. In instances of restricted distributions, the utilizationof secret passwords might be one means for providing security for the software.The existence or nonexistence of passwords will not be a conclusive factorin determining whether a distribution is genuinely restricted. Many massmarketed machine-readable works contain passwords. These passwords areoften disclosed in the written documentation accompanying the work. TheLibrary will determine whether a distribution is genuinely restricted ona case-by-case basis.f. <T3>Harmonization of the Deposit Requirements. </T3>Under the mandatorydeposit procedures adopted by the Library, deposit of machine-readableworks for registration purposes differs from the deposit required for mandatorydeposit. Some of the commentators urged that the Examining Division ofthe Copyright Office accept machine-readable copies.The variation stems from the disparate purposes of deposit for registrationand for enrichment of the Library's collections. The Examining Divisionis required to examine for copyrightable authorship. Machine-readable copiesare generally unsuitable for this task. The computer code may not be viewableon a computer screen or printed out without utilization of expensive, andoften different, hardware. The Examining Division requires human-readabledeposits for examination, generally portions of source code. The Machine-ReadableCollections Reading Room, on the other hand, can only utilize works inthose machine-readable formats for which it has acquired hardware.The Library has no interest in accessioning many of the computer programsin which claims to copyright have been registered in the Copyright Office.Clearly, unpublished computer programs and those of formats not designatedin the Best Edition Statement could not be demanded. Additionally, certainrestricted computer programs and software would not be desired by the ReadingRoom, and the Library will demand deposit of only those selected formatsthat are compatible with the limited hardware in the Reading Room. As aresult, many copyright owners of computer software will never be askedto deposit machine-readable copies.For those relatively few works that are demanded, the variation in depositrequirements is slight. It is likely, moreover, that any harmonizationof the mandatory deposit and registration deposit requirements would resultin deposit of both machine-readable and human-readable copies for registrationpurposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Copyright Office takesthe position that this Act does not apply to Copyright Office rulemaking.The Copyright Office is a department of the Library of Congress, and isa part of the legislative branch. Neither the Library of Congress nor theCopyright Office is an ``agency'' within the meaning of the AdministrativeProcedure Act of June 11, 1946, as amended (Title 5, chapter 5 of the U.S.Code, subchapter II and chapter 7). The Regulatory Flexibility Act consequentlydoes not apply to the Copyright Office since that Act affects only thoseentities of the Federal Government that are agencies as defined in theAdministrative Procedure Act.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Copyright Office was not subject to the AdministrativeProcedure Act before 1976, and it is now subject to it only in areas specifiedby section 701(d) of the Copyright Act (i.e. ``all actions taken by theRegister of Copyrights under this title (17),'' except with respect tothe making of copies of copyright deposits). (17 U.S.C. 706(b)). The CopyrightAct does not make the Office an ``agency'' as defined in the AdministrativeProcedure Act. For example, personnel actions taken by the Office are notsubject to APA-FOIA requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 202</ITAG>Copyright, Computer programs, Mandatory deposit under copyright.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, Part 202 of 37 CFR, Chapter II, is amendedin the manner set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 202_REGISTRATION OF CLAIMS TO COPYRIGHT</ITAG>1.

Also works publishedin a form requiring the use of a machine or device for purposes of opticalenlargement (such as film, filmstrips, slide films and works publishedin any variety or microform), and works published in visually perceptibleform but used in connection with optical scanning devices, are not withinthis category and are subject to the applicable deposit requirements.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(d) * * *(2) * * *(vii) In the case of published computer programs and published computerizedinformation works, such as statistical compendia, serials, and referenceworks that are not copy-protected, the deposit of one complete copy ofthe best edition as specified in the current Library of Congress Best EditionStatement will suffice in lieu of the two copies required by paragraph(d)(1) of this section.

By adding Appendix B to part 202 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix B to Part 202_``Best Edition'' of Published Copyrighted Worksfor the Collections of the Library of Congress</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The copyright law (title 17, United States Code) requires that copiesor phonorecords deposited in the Copyright Office be of the ``best edition''of the work. The law states that ``The `best edition' of a work is theedition, published in the United States at any time before the date ofdeposit, that the Library of Congress determines to be most suitable forits purposes.'' (For works first published only in a country other thanthe United States, the law requires the deposit of the best edition asfirst published.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When two or more editions of the same version of a work have beenpublished, the one of the highest quality is generally considered to bethe best edition.

The edition which first fails to satisfy a criterion is to beconsidered of inferior quality and will not be an acceptable deposit. Example:If a comparison is made between two hardbound editions of a book, one atrade edition printed on acid-free paper, and the other a specially boundedition printed on average paper, the former will be the best edition becausethe type of paper is a more important criterion than the binding. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under regulations of the Copyright Office, potential depositors mayrequest authorization to deposit copies or phonorecords of other than thebest edition of a specific work (e.g., a microform rather than a printededition of a serial), by requesting ``special relief'' from the depositrequirements.
