Texas thrifts are the biggest problem of the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. Almost 150 Texas thrifts are insolvent and the FSLIC is attempting to recapitalize them with new capital through federally assisted acquisitions. But the pace of transactions has been slipping in recent weeks, and critics say the problem is worsening. The FSLIC said recently that it expected to announce several major Texas thrift acquisitions by mid-August, but no announcements have been made.    Mr. Seidman's estimate is lower than those of private industry analysts who project that the thrift industry's cleanup bill may amount to $100 billion. The problem, which stems from loose lending practices during the boom in the Southwest, is expected to be a leading issue for the next administration. </TEXT></DOC>
