This announcementdoes not prevent any other date for eligibility in the fishery or anothermethod of controlling fishing effort from being proposed and implemented.The intended effect of this announcement is to discourage new entry tothe fishery based on speculation, while discussions continue on whetherand how access to the scallop resource should be controlled.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Douglas G. Marshall (ExecutiveDirector, New England Fishery Management Council), 617-231-0422 or PatriciaKurkul, Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service (508-281-9331).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Six proposals to amend the FisheryManagement Plan for Atlantic Sea Scallops were taken to informational hearingsin February and March by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council).Five hearings were held from Maine through North Carolina. Several of theproposals included provisions for establishment of a moratorium on vesselsentering the fishery, and other fishing effort control measures.After reviewing comments from the hearings and discussing the matter atits March 2, 1989 meeting, the Council voted to establish and publish theearliest possible control date which may be used for evaluating ``historicparticipation'' in the fishery, in the event that a moratorium is establishedor limited entry is used as a management measure. Accordingly, personswho enter the fishery after March 2, 1989, are not assured of future participation,should the Council develop, and the Secretary of Commerce implement, anaccess management regime that limits the number of participants in thescallop fishery.In specifying the control date, the Council is acting in response to reportsof an expanding number of fishery vessels entering the Atlantic sea scallopfleet, and the inability of the resource to support significantly increasedeffort.Initial estimates of catch composition and the historical experience ofregular fluctuations in resource abundance suggest an impending declinein the available scallop stocks. The Council concluded that the vesselsactive in the fishery at this time have sufficient capacity, if not anovercapacity, to harvest the available yield of the sea scallop stocks.The Council has decided that the establishment of an access managementprogram for the fishery should be considered.The Council's intent in making this announcement is to discourage speculativeentry into the sea scallop fishery while potential management regimes tocontrol access into the fishery are discussed and possibly developed bythe Council. The control date will help to distinguish bona fide establishedfishermen from the speculative entrants to the fishery. Although fishermenare notified that entering the fishery after the control date will notassure them of future access to the sea scallop fishery on the groundsof previous participation, other qualifying criteria also may be appliedfor entry.This announcement hereby establishes March 2, 1989, for potential use indetermining historical or traditional participation in the sea scallopfishery. The action does not commit the Council to develop any particularmanagement regime or any specific criteria for determining entry to thesea scallop fishery. Fishermen are not guaranteed future participationin the sea scallop fishery, regardless of their date of entry or intensityof participation in the fishery before or after the control date.The Council may choose a different control date, or it may choose a managementregime that does not make use of such a date. The Council may choose togive variably weighted consideration to fishermen in the fishery beforeand after the control date. The Council may choose also to take no furtheraction to control entry or access to the fishery. Any action by the Councilwill be taken pursuant to the requirements for FMP development establishedunder the Magnuson Act.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
