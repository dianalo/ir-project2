Pertinent physical characteristics of the concrete weremeasured, and leaching tests were performed. Data were analyzed by establishedmass transport principles, and predictions of leaching for several yearswere made. A numerical algorithm was used to model removal of {sup 137}Csand {sup 90}Sr by forced flow-through leaching. Results indicated thatforced flow-through leaching would require only a few days, whereas completedecontamination by submerged, diffusion-only methods would require severalyears. 9 refs., 8 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
