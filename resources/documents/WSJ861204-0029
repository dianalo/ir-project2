Separately, AGS predicted record earnings and sales for the fourth quarter.    AGS, a Mountainside, N.J., maker of software for International Business Machines Corp. mainframe computers, said the acquisition of closely held Vista Concepts Inc. -- which sells software programs and services and has annual revenue of about $18 million -- would increase AGS's presence in the banking and financial services market and add to next year's earnings.    Lawrence Schoenberg, AGS chairman, told New York securities analysts that he expects the fourth quarter to bring record results. Year-ago net was $2 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $75.5 million. In an interview, Mr. Schoenberg added that fourth-quarter results will &quot;substantially&quot; exceed the third quarter's net of $2.3 million, or 45 cents a share, on $95.4 million in sales.    Mr. Schoenberg also predicted that the new tax law would boost annual earnings at least 8% for 1987 -- and that an as-yet undetermined gain could go as high as 42 cents a share for the year because of new rules for deferred taxes -- if all other business conditions were to stay unchanged from the third quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
