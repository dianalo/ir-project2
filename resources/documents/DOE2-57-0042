It is shown that GdB/sub 6/-ZrB/sub 2/ systemis quasistationary one, and state diagram of the system is classifiedas of eutectic type. The data of X-ray diffraction and metallographicanalyses, determination of temparature of melting initiation, measurementof microhardness of phase components were used for plotting state diagramof GdB/sub 6/-ZrB/sub 2/ system, characterized by eutectic presence andthe absence of registered component solubility, since sufficient changeof lattice parameters of basic components in alloy with 5 mass% contentof the second component after continuous heat treatment at eutectic temperaturewas not observed.</TEXT></DOC>
