On other markets, copper futures continued to climb; grains andsoybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mostly lower;and stock-index futures retreated.   The gold market has shown vigor since its return last week tospot prices above $400 a troy ounce. Analysts said prices appearpoised to move even higher than Monday's finish of $408.60 an ouncefor October delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange.   ``We'll probably get up to $413 or $415 on spot gold,'' saidRichard Levine, vice president of precious metals and currencytrading with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.   But Levine said gold's recovery would depend upon continuedstrength in the buoyant platinum market and in crude oil prices.   He said Monday's gains were largely due to short covering _stop-loss buying by those who had bet on falling prices.   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said $400 an ounceproved to be a strong technical support point for gold once themetal's price had settled firmly above that level.   ``Today we built on the relatively modest gains of last week,''Steel said.   Like Levine, Steel linked gold's renewed strength to thedollar's weakness, the oil market's rally and platinum's recovery,which is based on supply concerns.   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $5.40 to $5.50 higherwith the contract for delivery in December at $412.70 a troy ounce;silver was 1.5 cents to 1.7 cents higher with December at $6.42 atroy ounce.   Platinum settled $8.80 to $10.80 higher on the New YorkMercantile Exchange with October at $520.40 a troy ounce.   Copper futures prices continued to climb on the CommodityExchange, posting new contract highs for the sixth consecutive dayon fears of tight supply.   Copper settled 1.85 cents to 3.80 cents higher with October at$1.28 a pound.   Oil prices soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Analystssaid buying was spurred by Saudi Arabia's statement that it wouldabide by its OPEC crude production quota if other members of theoil cartel would do the same.   Iraq also indicated its willingness to abide by its productionquota set by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   OPEC overproduction has been blamed for the persistent weaknessof oil prices.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude,settled 43 cents to 66 cents higher with November at $13.60 abarrel; heating oil was 1.23 cents to 1.57 cents higher withNovember at 38.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .70 cent to1.35 cents higher with November at 41.41 cents a gallon.   Soybean futures finished higher, wheat settled lower and cornfutures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflectingdiffering opinions about the size of the nation's corn and soybeancrops.   The Agriculture Department will release its updated cropproduction estimates Wednesday afternoon. Trading activity ahead ofsuch reports typically revolves around speculation about thegovernment's estimates.   Traders generally expect the USDA to increase its productionestimates from last month's predictions of 1.47 billion bushels ofsoybeans and 4.46 billion bushels of corn.   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7\ cents lower with the contract fordelivery in December at $4.27{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to2\ cents higher with December at $2.92} a bushel; oats were 2}cents to 4{ cents higher with December at $2.47 a bushel; soybeanswere 1} cents to 4} cents higher with November at $7.91} a bushel.   Most cattle futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile Exchangeamid concerns about narrow packer profit margins and weakeningdemand for beef, analysts said.   Hog futures retreated on technical factors and expectations thathog prices in the spot market would open lower on Tuesday.   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .15 cent higher withOctober at 72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .55cent lower with October at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .03cent to .52 cent lower with October at 40.42 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were .28 cent lower to .20 cent higher with Februaryat 47.65 cents a pound.
