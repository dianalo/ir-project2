But the FederalReserve's goal of steadily squeezing out inflation isreceding further into the future and its anti-inflationcampaign seems likely to lose rather than gain momentum. Atbest, many economists say, inflation in 1990 will match lastyear's pace. Moreover, there's rising concern that priceincreases will actually intensify.   Why the increased concern about inflation? For one thing,the Federal Reserve, despite its goal to squeeze down priceincreases, is under growing political pressure to avoid movesthat might derail the expansion, especially in an electionyear. Inflation, moreover, is growing as a worldwide problem,pushing up prices of U.S. imports. &quot;The global trend istoward accelerating inflation,&quot; says Paul W. Boltz, aneconomist at T. Rowe Price Associates. Then, too, cost-pushinflation -- when rising costs are the chief reason forrising prices -- is becoming more of a problem, and that'shard for the Fed to deal with. Finally, a lot of the upwardpressure is in services, where prices seem to keep rising nomatter what the central bank does.   The consumer price index in the first quarter rose at anannual rate of 8.5%, the highest rate in eight years. Thejump stemmed in large part from weather-related increases infood and energy prices, and in March there was a significantrise in apparel prices. Many economists predict the inflationrate will plunge this month and next month, but a growingnumber of analysts figure the price pressures after that willbe onward and upward.   So far economists don't expect any immediate priceexplosions. The 51 forecasters interviewed monthly by BlueChip Economic Indicators this month forecast a 4.6% rise inthe consumer price index this year, up from a prediction of a4.4% gain a month earlier.   Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of SanFrancisco and a member of the Open Market Committee, theFed's chief policy-making group, predicts the inflation ratewill slow from the first-quarter pace but will still behigher than last year's 4.8%. &quot;That,&quot; he says, &quot;isuncomfortable and unacceptable.&quot;   Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Federal ReserveBank and also an Open Market Committee member, dissented whenthe committee voted in February to maintain unchanged policy.His argument: &quot;The Federal Reserve should tighten policyimmediately to combat inflation.&quot;   David H. Resler, chief economist of Nomura SecuritiesInternational, is one of a number of analysts who expect theFed to tighten policy soon, probably by a small increase inthe federal funds rate, the fee charged on short-term loansof bank reserves. Mr. Resler fears such action could tip theeconomy into a recession.   The Federal Reserve might be encouraged to take such amodest move, reaffirming its anti-inflation role, becauseeconomic growth has been stronger than expected. The BlueChip analysts on the average now expect theinflation-adjusted gross national product to rise by 1.9% inthis year's first half, compared with a forecast of a 1.7%gain a month earlier. But the Blue Chip group probably willraise its forecast this month, since the first quarter's 2.1%GNP gain, announced last week, was considerably stronger thanthe analysts expected.   Donald Straszheim of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smithsays, &quot;Economic growth will be considerably stronger in thefirst half of 1990 than the consensus expectation.&quot; He looksfor growth of about 2.5% in this year's first six months.   Supporting such forecasts of stronger growth is a sharprise in durable-goods orders in March. On a seasonallyadjusted basis, orders rose by 6.7%, the biggest monthly gainsince December 1988, when orders climbed by 7.4%, whichprompted the Fed to tighten monetary policy. The Fed easedagain in June 1989, in what Chairman Alan Greenspan called amidcourse correction.   Looking ahead, Lacy Hunt, chief economist of Carroll,McEntee andamp; McGinley, a New York investment firm, doubts therewill be any significant anti-inflation moves by the Fed.&quot;Greenspan,&quot; he says, &quot;has grown cautious and more responsiveto White House pressure to hold down interest rates.&quot; But hedoes expect a modest tightening to be voted by the Maymeeting of the Open Market Committee.   The rapid growth of the money supply since last Juneworries the Fed's Mr. Hoskins. Since mid-1989, M2, whichconsists of currency, checking deposits and many savingsaccounts and is the most commonly watched aggregate, hasgrown at an annual rate of more than 7%, well above thegrowth rate for the prior year.   But at this stage of the business cycle, Mr. Hoskins adds,cost-push inflation is beginning to play a larger role. Inthe 12 months ended March 31, for instance, the LaborDepartment's employment cost index rose 5.5%, compared with a5% gain in the 12 months. Recently, moreover, the rise hasaccelerated. The index climbed 1.7% in this year's firstquarter, compared with a 1.2% increase a year earlier.   A so-called leading inflation index compiled by Columbia'sCenter for International Business Cycle Research had droppedto a four-year low in February, but it bounced up in March.It is heavily weighted with cost factors and its rise,according to Geoffrey Moore, the center's director, &quot;raisesthe possibility that inflation may accelerate in comingmonths.&quot;   Major contributors to the March rise, he reports, were anincrease in the percentage of companies experiencing slowerdeliveries and a rise to 63.4% in the percentage of thepopulation employed, which matched the highest monthly rateon record.   Record employment, however, isn't being matched byproductivity, and this adds to cost pressures sinceproductivity gains tend to offset the inflationary impact ofpay increases. With the supply of available labor dropping,output per hour by nonfarm workers last year rose by only0.9%, the smallest gain since 1982.   Cost-push and demand-pull inflation, as economists callthe two basic kinds of inflationary pressure, have posedchallenges for the Fed throughout its history. Usuallycost-push inflation is strongest when the economy has beenexpanding for a long time, as now. It also tends by itsnature to be more difficult to control through monetarypolicy. Demand-pull inflation -- too much money chasing goodsand services -- usually predominates earlier in expansion andresponds more readily to the Fed's brakes.   In late 1980, the consumer-price index was rising at anannual rate of nearly 16%, so the Fed set out to bring itdown by tightening its policy. The move succeeded quickly: By1982 inflation was down to 4%. A cost of the sharp drop,however, was the deep recession of 1981-82, a fact thatFederal Reserve officials haven't forgotten.   Since 1982, the Fed has moved cautiously, and theinflation rate has stayed in the area of 4% to 5%, except fora temporary respite in 1986, when an oil price drop actuallyproduced declines in the consumer index, and the firstquarter of 1990. The Fed, from all appearances, hasn't theslightest intention to repeat the Draconian measures of 1980-- very tight money -- to erase 4%-to-5% inflation.   According to Paul L. Kasriel, vice president of Chicago'sNorthern Trust Co., &quot;The Fed's strategy is to keep realeconomic growth moderate over an extended period of time inorder to lessen pressures on resource utilization rates and,thus, bring down the rate of inflation.&quot;   Federal officials talk of pushing the inflation rate downto zero, a task that they concede might take at least fiveyears. But this may be unrealistic. Joel Popkin, a formercommissioner of Labor Statistics now serving as an economicconsultant in Washington, says the Fed is overestimating &quot;itsability to point the inflation rate down to 4%, let alonezero.&quot;   The reason, many analysts believe, is that in times ofeconomic weakness, many people expect the Fed, underpolitical pressure to avoid a recession, to ease money.Expectations of an easier policy lead people to spend more,tending to increase inflationary pressures.   As Allan Sproul, former president of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, used to say, the Fed is independent withinthe government, not independent of it.   Even Mr. Hoskins believes that there may come a time whenthe Fed will drop its anti-inflation rhetoric and turn, onceagain, to fighting recession.   One fact that bodes ill for the zero-inflation advocatessuch as Mr. Hoskins is that so many influential analystsdon't seem too worried by 4%-to-5% inflation. Their viewshelp to persuade the public that it's pointless to risk arecession by tightening money to eliminate the remaininginflation.   James Tobin, a Yale University economist and Nobellaureate, argues that the question is whether the inflationis anticipated or not. If inflation is anticipated, he says,companies, individuals and governments can arrange to dealwith it.   But this may be a questionable assumption. The governmenthas partly indexed the tax system to help to protecttaxpayers from inflation, many pensions are indexed and, ifyou listen to securities salesmen, common stocks are supposedto be a hedge against inflation. But the protection is unevenat best, even if individuals know what the future holds.   The trouble is that no one can know exactly what theinflation rate will be. Mr. Hoskins says, &quot;I don't thinkpeople really believe that the Fed can keep the inflationrate at 4% indefinitely, so a permanent 4% rate is notanticipated. I believe the rate will go above 4%, and themarkets seem to agree. The flareup over the 8.5% CPI rate inthe first quarter certainly didn't show any faith in apermanent 4% inflation rate.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
