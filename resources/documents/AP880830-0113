In Gdansk, senior Solidarity adviser Adam Michnik said Walesawould hold talks Wednesday with Interior Minister Gen. CzeslawKiszczak and a representative of the Roman Catholic church. Otheraides said there had been no immediate agreement to end the strikesthat have swept Poland for two weeks.   ``The stoppage of strikes by Mr. Lech Walesa and the shipyardwhere he works would mean automatically convening a round table,''chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters earlier inthe day.   Urban said there were no preconditions on what subjects could bediscussed, adding: ``The starting of talks will be a commonvictory.''   Kiszczak would mediate the round-table talks, Urban said. Hedeclined to elaborate on other possible participants, but hintedthe head of the official OPZZ union would be included.   Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of accords signed in Gdanskguaranteeing the right to free trade unions. Solidarity, once theonly independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc, was outlawedfollowing the imposition of martial law in 1981.   If the talks do take place, they would be the first directcontact between Walesa and high government officials since he wasinterned after the martial law crackdown that crushed Solidarity.   Round-table talks were proposed first Friday by Kiszczak, whosaid there would be no pre-conditions although he indicated thestrikes must first end.   Aides earlier quoted Walesa, a founder of Solidarity, as sayinghe would not call for an end to the strikes without pledges thattalks involve the issue of union pluralism. He also was quoted assaying he should take part as recognized chairman of Solidarity.   Ten enterprises remained idled by work stoppages in Poland'smost serious wave of strikes since 1981. The work stoppages beganAug. 16.   About 5,000 workers joined an occupation strike at a majorsoutheastern steel mill on Monday after authorities attempted toreopen it, and talks between striking workers and management brokeoff at a coal mine and in the Baltic port of Szczecin.   During the peak of the unrest, about 20 enterprises employing100,000 workers were idled.   The week-old strike at the defense-related Stalowa Wola mill insoutheastern Poland swelled dramatically Monday when managers triedto reopen the 18,000-worker plant, strikers and authorities said.   ``Strikers control a substantial part of the complex'sterritory,'' state radio said of the strike. ``They control roadsinside the plant. They check IDs of passing people who are not onstrike.''   Piotr Niemczyk, a spokesman for the Solidarity informationcenter in Warsaw, said the strikers demanded Walesa negotiate ontheir behalf.   Talks broke down at the July Manifesto coal mine, where theseries of strikes began, after management refused to allow workersto speak to Walesa by telephone, according to Solidarity activistLech Bosiak.   July Manifesto is in Jastrzebie, near the Czechoslovak border,and is the last of 12 coal mines still on strike. Its strikecommittee was ``waiting for Lech Walesa's talks at the famous roundtable,'' Bosiak said.   Jerzy Majka, a Communist Party spokesman, on Sunday calledWalesa a ``possible participant'' in round-table nationalreconciliation talks.   But he said Walesa could not be participate as the head of anillegal organization.   In a statement spirited out of the strikebound Lenin shipyard inthe Baltic port of Gdansk, Walesa said he was ready to participatein talks but ``there must be compromise on both sides.''   ``I do not want to participate as a private individual. ... Istand behind Solidarity,'' he said, adding that the talks must takeup the issue of trade union pluralism.   The mediator between Walesa and the government, AndrzejStelmachowski, a law professor and head of the Warsaw branch of theCatholic Intellectuals Club, said it remained unclear whether thetalks, endorsed by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, wouldcome about.   ``The workers must decide if they wish to start the talks ornot, because the government insists the strikes must end before thetalks around the round table begin,'' Stelmachowski said.   ``The workers are hesitant, because of the risk, which isenormous,'' he said.   Stelmachowski said that although he felt there was good will onboth sides, ``mistrust is so great ... that it is very difficult toput them together.''   He said there was no deadline for agreeing to talks, but some ofthe strikes were connected with military products and thegovernment would not tolerate such stoppages indefinitely.   Air Force Col. Mieczyslaw Laskowski, interviewed by statetelevision, noted that Stalowa Wola is a defense industry plantserving Poland and its socialist allies, and said no country in theworld allowed strikes at such facilities.   ``The situation cannot tolerated ad infinitum,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
