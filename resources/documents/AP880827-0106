(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On only her second day off in 50 daysof 12- to 24-hour shifts fighting western forest fires, DorothyHays went dancing.   She and hundreds of others battling this summer's record-settingfires are having the time and challenge of their lives.   But for some, fatigue is setting in. The duration of these giantblazes, fueled by drought-dried timber and erratic wind, has begunto take its toll on those cutting and digging on the front lines.   ``We just don't have enough bodies anymore. We're spread sothin,'' U.S. Forest Service spokesman Bob McHugh said Saturday.   Firefighters work at least 12- to 16-hour shifts for at least 10days straight before one day of rest and relaxation is granted.Some find themselves working double shifts.   Some end up in crews that employ ``coyote tactics'' _ staying atthe battle front for up to 36 hours straight until all food andsupplies are exhausted.   ``If you get tired, fatigue can be dangerous. You forget aboutsafety,'' said Kirby More, who's been fighting fires since 1956.``But we hold up. Our folks are trained for this.''   On Saturday, More's ``hot shot'' crew was heading to the top ofa mountain ridge to clear a 40-foot-wide fire break through theforest. The work had to be done by hand because the terrain was toosteep for bulldozers.   ``It ain't the fun, although at times it is fun. And it sureain't the pay. I think I do it for the challenge, the excitement.It's one hell of a challenge, and sometimes you get to say `Damn,we stopped it,''' More said.   Ms. Hays, a Forest Service employee from Oregon, said flamestwice forced her crew to retreat quickly. Her crew digs lines atthe front of the Storm Creek fire, which on Friday threatened CookeCity, in south-central Montana just northeast of YellowstoneNational Park.   She and the rest of her crew went to Red Lodge, about 40 milesaway, Friday night and went dancing at a tavern. Saturday they wereback on the fire.   ``We were getting pretty tired, but the Randamp;R was real good,'' shesaid. ``It's real exciting being out there because you never knowwhat's going to happen next. It's a lot of fun.''   When the crew has to pull double shifts, 24 hours straight,``people start dropping like flies,'' said Brian Spivey.   Forest Service officials said some crews were losing people whohad to return to school or jobs. That, coupled with new fires inother parts of the West, caused manpower problems. About 1,200soldiers from Fort Lewis in Washington state were being trained tojoin the front lines.   Saturday morning, some 830 firefighters were in a camp outsidethis tiny town. They are paid at varying rates, starting at $6.38an hour, since some are civilian contractors and others come fromvarious federal agencies, including the Forest Service and Bureauof Land Management. Depending on their agency and pay scale, somereceive overtime and hazard pay as well.   The Forest Service provides large, nourishing meals and lots ofbeverages.   ``They feed you a lot of liquids and a lot of food,'' said JamesBegay, a Navajo firefighter from Window Rock, Ariz. ``They keep yougoing.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT></DOC>
