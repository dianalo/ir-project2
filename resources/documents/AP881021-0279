The inflation-sensitive metals market had been looking for aslightly greater increase in the consumer price index.   On other markets, cattle were lower while pork futures weremixed; grains and soybeans posted moderate losses; energy futureswere mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.   Gold, silver and platinum prices were due for a downward moveafter the gains of the past two weeks, and the Labor Department'sreport on consumer prices provided a catalyst, analysts said.   Gold settled $3.80 to $3.90 lower on New York's CommodityExchange with the contract for delivery in December at $411.50 atroy ounce; silver was 12.5 cents to 13.4 cents lower with Decemberat $6.285 a troy ounce.   Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled$10.90 to $12.60 lower with October at $528.90 a troy ounce.   The sell-off began with orders from overseas customers toliquidate their gold holdings in reaction to thelower-than-expected inflation number, said Stephen Platt, metalsanalyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.   The overseas selling ``gave us our initial thrust down,'' Plattsaid. ``There also was a lot of disappointment over the (gold)market's inability to react to the recent dollar weakness and toearly strength in the crude-oil market.''   Gold's failure to rally on those bullish signals sent the silverand platinum markets into a tailspin, analysts said.   The relatively low inflation number continued a trend that wasblamed for gold's plunge below $400 a troy ounce last month.   ``It's difficult to make a case for large purchases of preciousmetals at this time as a hedge against inflation. There's nothingto suggest we're going to have a wild bout of inflation in the nextfew months,'' said David Syphen, manager of metals futures tradingfor Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.   Cattle futures finished mostly lower while pork futures settlednarrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of someAgriculture Department reports that pointed toward higher beefprices and lower bacon prices.   The quarterly cattle-on-feed report pegged the number of cattlebeing fattened for slaughter on feedlots Oct. 1 in the 13 largestcattle states at 8.6 million head, down 5 percent from a yearearlier.   Feedlot placements dipped 10 percent in the third quartercompared to the same period a year ago while marketings off offeedlots increased 2 percent to 6.2 million, a record third-quarterhigh.   Cattle producers reduced their feedyard placements and the sizeof their herds because of the summer drought, which dried uppastures and raised the cost of feed grains, analysts said.   In another report, the USDA said the amount of frozen porkbellies in cold storage fell last month to 29.4 million pounds from42.6 million pounds. The market had expected an even lower number,so analysts predicted a drop in pork-belly futures prices next week.   Live cattle settled .35 cent lower to .17 cent higher withDecember at 74.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .22cent lower with October at 81.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .30cent lower to .15 cent higher with December at 41.87 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .97 cent higher with Februaryat 49.62 cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures finished moderately lower on theChicago Board of Trade in late liquidation linked to beneficialrains in Brazil's soybean country and bearish chart signals in thewheat market.   Corn prices retreated in a continuing reaction to Thursday'srumor that the Soviet Union had spurned a shipment of U.S. corn dueto the presence of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic mold, analysts said.   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 5\ cents lower with the contract fordelivery in December at $4.19{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 3 centslower with December at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were 4{ cents lower to{ cent higher with December at $2.50\ a bushel; soybeans were \cent to 10 cents lower with November at $7.74} a bushel.   Crude oil futures were nearly unchanged and heating oil wasnarrowly mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange but gasolinefutures rose sharply on indications of continuing tight supplies.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was unchanged to 9 cents lowerwith December at $14.37 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent lower to.13 cent higher with November at 42.71 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .10 cent to 1.87 cents higher with November at 51.22cents a gallon.   Stock-index futures gained slightly on the Chicago MercantileExchange with the contract for December delivery of the Standard andamp;Poor's 500 up .25 point at 285.00.</TEXT></DOC>
