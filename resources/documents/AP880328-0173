Kang Won-il, the prosecutor in charge of the case, and hisassistants said Monday that Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, and three of hisaides were to be questioned about the alleged embezzlement of up to$14 million from the Seemaul (New Community) development program.   Kang said investigators have uncovered evidence linking ChunKyung-hwan, a younger brother of the ex-president, with $9.3million of the funds.   Opposition leaders have called for investigations of othermembers of the Chun family.   Saemaul was founded in 1971 to promote urban and ruraldevelopment. Chun Kyung-hwan, appointed by his brother, headed theagency from 1981 to 1987.   He has been accused of using his position to obtain donations,sell influence and divert government funds to invest inprofit-oriented projects.   Prosecutors said that last week investigators found about adozen secret bank accounts the younger Chun used under false names.   Scores of government officials have been questioned in the case,but prosecutors said most would face minor reprimands and notcriminal prosecution.   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam demanded Monday that theinvestigation be expanded to cover all allegations of corruptioninvolving the administration of ex-President Chun. He was in officefrom 1980 until last month when Roh Tae-woo was inaugurated afterwinning the presidential election in December.   ``The administration should not be allowed to terminate theinvestigation of Chun Kyung-hwan's scandals,'' Kim said inannouncing his candidacy for next month's National Assemblyelections.   Protests about the Saemaul case intensified after ChunKyung-hwan, using a false name, flew to Osaka, Japan, on March 18.He returned to Korea two days later for questioning.   The government probe of the scandal is seen by some politicalobservers as part of an effort by Roh to discredit the formerpresident and his supporters, who allegedly were attempting tomaintain power within the government.   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with militarybacking, promised during the presidential election campaign to rootout official corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
