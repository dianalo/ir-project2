<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0776 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method is described for the production of semiconductor laser devicescomprising: growing a multi-layered crystal structure, containing anactive layer for laser oscillation, on a p-substrate, etching the multi-layeredcrystal structure to form a striped mesa-portion, disposing a first layerof a first conductivity type over the entirety of an upper face of themulti-layer structure with the exception of an upper face of the stripedmesa-portion, the first layer surrounding both sides of the striped mesa-portionto form a heterojunction at each of both side faces of the active layer;disposing a second layer of a second conductivity type, opposite to thefirst conductivity type, over the first layer; disposing a third layerof the first conductivity type over the second layer; and disposing aburying layer of the second conductivity type over the third layer andthe upper face of the striped mesa-portion.</TEXT></DOC>
