Nikko is following the lead of Nomura Securities Co., and Daiwa Securities Co., which have launched investment trusts specializing in U.S. government securities. Nomura's 300 billion yen fund follows a similar fund begun earlier this week by Daiwa.    Nikko's investment trust would invest in government securities from several different countries. While Nomura's fund will mostly invest in U.S. government securities, it can invest in agency issues. Nomura's investment trust is to end Aug. 20, 1993. The fund will buy only securities maturing before that date.    Daiwa and Nomura are attempting to hedge currency risk in their funds, and Nikko also will do so, in addition to using portfolio insurance, the Nikko official said.    Another firm, Yamaichi Securities Co., is considering launching a yen-based fund to invest in U.S. government securities. Last month, Yamaichi launched a dollar-denominated fund to invest in U.S. Treasuries and now is considering a yen-denominated trust. A company official wouldn't give a timeframe for a decision to be made on launching a new fund. </TEXT></DOC>
