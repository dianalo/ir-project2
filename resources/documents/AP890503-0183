WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl had his firstmeeting late Wednesday with the new, tough-talking U.S. ambassadorafter the Netherlands and Canada pushed for compromise in a NATOdispute over defense strategy.   Ambassador Vernon A. Walters repeatedly has stated his supportfor a NATO project that would more than triple the range of nuclearmissiles based in West Germany, and his opposition to arms talkswith the Kremlin aimed at reducing short-range missile stockpiles.   But embassy spokesman Bill Bach said Walters, who started hisjob last week, would make no public comment on his talks with WestGerman leaders in alliance efforts to resolve the issue.   Government spokesman Reinhardt Schwarzer said Kohl's office alsowould not comment officially.   In Washington, President Bush on Thursday ruled out negotiationswith Moscow on short-range nuclear missiles and the White Houseportrayed Bush's disagreement with Kohl as a sign of NATO'svitality.   Kohl stirred the long-simmering dispute over short-range nuclearforces _ which arms negotiators call SNF _ into a full-fledgedcontroversy last week when he called for negotiations aimed at``the third zero,'' or ultimate elimination of short-range missiles.   Talks are already in progress to cut the superpower arsenals oflong-range missiles, and the December 1987 agreement onintermediate-range forces set out the total removal of thoseweapons to reach the first zero.   The Pentagon opposes negotiations on short-range missiles,claiming the Warsaw Pact has a predominance in conventional armsand that until a balance is achieved the Western alliance needs toretain a nuclear option.   But West German fears of becoming a nuclear battlegroundintensified in recent months because most of the short-rangemissiles _ the only nuclear weapons not under negotiation _ arebased in West Germany.   Of NATO's 88 Lance missile launchers deployed in Central Europe,76 are in West Germany. The rockets have a range of about 75 miles,so their use would mean fighting a nuclear war on West Germanterritory.   The SNF flareup triggered a flurry of diplomatic efforts to workout a compromise that would satisfy all 16 member nations of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.   U.S. officials here and in Washington and Brussels say theypresented ideas to resolve the impasse, but no visible signsemerged that the dispute would soon be put to rest.   Canada said Wednesday it had communicated a compromise plan toBonn, Washington and London, but External Affairs spokesmanChristian Sarrazin said no details would be disclosed.   A senior Bonn official told The Associated Press the Canadianproposal was ``under review'' by the Foreign Ministry but said hecould not comment further.   Government spokesman Hans Klein was asked at a news conferenceif Kohl would insist on opening short-range talks before WestGermany's next federal elections in December 1990, or if timing ofthe forum was a possible area of compromise.   ``A lot of things are possible,'' Klein replied vaguely.   A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters in Bonn oncondition of anonymity, expressed confidence the SNF debate wouldbe ironed out by the end of the month when leaders of NATO nationsmeet in Brussels for their annual summit.   Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers talked with Kohl earlier Wednesday onways of breaking the impasse, but officials refused to discussdetails.   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher met withFrench Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Kohl went to Rome as partof an apparent campaign to gain support for Bonn's position.   Bonn says Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spainsupport it on short-range talks and resistance to NATO's replacingthe Lance systems with new missiles capable of reaching targets 300miles away.   But Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita said his country favorslinking the SNF forum to progress toward a balance of conventionalarms between East and West, a condition also stipulated by theUnited States and Britain.</TEXT></DOC>
