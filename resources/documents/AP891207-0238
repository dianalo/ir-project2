The truck and diesel engine maker said it lost 8 cents a shareon sales of $1 billion compared with a profit for the year-earlierperiod of $82 million or 29 cents a share on sales of $1.2 billion.   For fiscal 1989, which ended Oct. 31, Navistar earned $87million or 23 cents a share on sales of $4.2 billion, down from1988 annual profits of $244 million or 84 cents a share on sales of$4.3 billion, the company said in a statement.   Navistar Chairman James C. Cotting blamed the fourth-quarterperformance on reduced demand for medium and heavy trucks, highercosts for components and lower sales of service parts and dieselengines to other vehicle makers.   Annual earnings were lowered by the ``excess costs'' of adding27 new truck models and of phasing in a new paint system atNavistar's Springfield, Ohio, plant, the company said. Navistarspokesman Bill Greenhouse said the company underestimated the costof introducing the new models.   The company also said it expects to post a 1990 first-quarterloss, because of ``lower truck and engine sales, increased materialand component costs, and continued intense price discounting bytruck manufacturers.''</TEXT></DOC>
