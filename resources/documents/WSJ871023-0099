WallStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MTC JNJ PFEFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><TEXT>   NutraSweet Co., a unit of Monsanto Co., said it sought government clearance for a new technology that would allow its low-calorie aspartame sweetener to be used in baked goods.    If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the new method has the potential to greatly expand NutraSweet's current market and transform the $15 billion market for sweet baked goods. But industry sources cautioned that the baked-good version of NutraSweet could still face technical hurdles. Moreover, by the time it is introduced on the market, the product could run into competition from two other new low-calorie sweeteners that are making their way through the approval process.    Though NutraSweet-brand sweetener is now used in products ranging from diet soft drinks to laxatives, its susceptibility to heat has thus far prevented its use in baked goods. The company said it has developed a method of coating the sweetener with food-grade materials to protect it from high heat during baking. The capsules would release the sweetener at the end of the baking process.    If the method is approved, NutraSweet said it plans to immediately begin marketing the sweetener to food processors as a branded ingredient for use in commercially prepared baked goods and mixes. The company wouldn't speculate on the baked-goods sweetener's potential market, but industry sources said it isn't likely to match NutraSweet's sales to the diet soft drink industry. Sales to that industry accounted for most of the Skokie, Ill.-based company's $711 million in sales last year. Besides its sweeteners business, St. Louis-based Monsanto has interests in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and other products.    Nevertheless, if widely adopted, the technology could greatly expand both the market for NutraSweet and baked goods. The introduction of NutraSweet ignited sales of diet soft drinks and helped revive stagnating markets for powdered soft drinks and Jell-O.    But the company may still face technological hurdles before NutraSweet can be widely adopted in baked goods. Since NutraSweet is 180 times sweeter than sugar, users must find other methods to replace the volume sugar currently provides. Sugar also adds texture to baked goods.    &quot;You just can't use a drop of NutraSweet in place of a cup of sugar,&quot; said an official at General Mills Inc. in Minneapolis.    NutraSweet said at least one &quot;bulking agent&quot; is already available, and it is currently working on others. Robert B. Shapiro, the company's chief executive officer, added that the market for the product will expand as better bulking agents are developed. The company said it won't market the baked-goods sweetener to consumers, since they don't have access to such ingredients.    By the time it is introduced, the new form of NutraSweet could also face competition from two other low-calorie sweeteners that are currently pending FDA approval -- Pfizer Inc.'s alitame and Johnson andamp; Johnson's sucralose. Pfizer has said alitame can be used in baking, and sucralose is said to be able to withstand higher temperatures than pure NutraSweet.    If NutraSweet's new technology wins quick approval, it will get a head start in that race, says William R. Young, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. But if approval drags on, the company &quot;will be stuck winning back market share,&quot; he adds.    But even with FDA approval, the new technology doesn't mean calorie-free doughnuts are just around the corner. Many of the calories in baked goods come from starches, oils and other sources, the company said, so NutraSweet would only cut calories 30% to 50%. </TEXT></DOC>
