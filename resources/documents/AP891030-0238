At stake are fast-rising wildlife exports worth more than $130billion a year on the world's retail markets, according tospecialists.   Two-thirds of the trade is legal, defended by well-organizedassociations and by governments. The rest is contraband, vianetworks of poachers and smugglers often involved in drugs or armsas well.   While sympathy can be whipped up over rhinos and leopards, lessnoble life forms suffer unnoticed, environmentalists say.   At a recent United Nations meeting in which elephants dominateddiscussions, lonely lobbyists pleaded for a delicate flower, theTurkish snowdrop, which is exported by the millions with unknownimplications.   Scientists warn that unless they can assemble more data andmuster public opinion, valuable species will plummet towardextinction during the coming decade.   ``We have very little idea of the size of many populations,''said David Western, a Kenyan biologist who is the director ofresearch for Wildlife Conservation International in New York. ``Itis a critical problem.''   When Guyana's caimans came up at the U.N. meeting, Guyaneseauthorities had to admit they had no idea how many of the scarcecrocodilians still lived along their rivers.   The beautiful brilliant green Manus tree snail, prized amongmollusk fans, is earning badly needed revenue for Papua-New Guinea,but no one knows how many can be safely sold.   ``Most countries just don't have the resources to find out whatthey have,'' said Western.   The 103-nation Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies, which adopted the ivory ban, regulates trade, but itssmall staff relies on outside data and enforcement.   If experts cannot agree that a species belongs on the``endangered'' list, it is regarded as ``threatened'' and may betraded under license.   ``When a species is listed as threatened, prices soar,'' saidCraig Van Note of Monitor Consortium, a Washington-based network ofU.S. and international environmental groups.   ``Everything that starts on the threatened list ends upendangered,'' he said. ``Vested interests push trade for all it'sworth. This is big money, and we are finding the same mafias thathandle drugs also dealing in wildlife.''   Until enough scientific evidence is gathered, species are not oneither list, and trade is determined mainly by the open market.   About 350 million tropical fish were sold last year, causingunknown depletions. In 14 years, France alone imported 1 billionfrog legs from South Asia.   ``We desperately need more data,'' said Ginette Hemley, U.S.head of Traffic, a monitoring agency supported by the WorldWildlife Fund. ``We have to raise major money. The onus is on us.''   She noted burgeoning demands for wildlife products in newlyaffluent nations.   ``It's booming in Asia, and consumption is increasingeverywhere,'' she said. ``The trend is just beginning.''   One Asian nation, Thailand, has been branded by wildlife groupsas one of the world's worst exploiters of wildlife.   Unless ways can be found to bring exports into line with speciespopulations, conservationists will have to push for a total ban ontrade within five years, Ms. Hemley said.   Traffic focuses on 30 species, mostly reptiles and birds, whichare particularly endangered. Smugglers are increasingly cunning,with substantial resources for bribery and subterfuge.   In the United States, Fish and Wildlife Service agents found$3.5 million worth of narcotics last year during searches. Thatincluded heroin in condoms stuffed into banned snakes and cocainestashed in polar bear hides.   The International Union for the Conservation of Nature andspecialist teams keep tabs on wildlife, but arguments can be heatedwhen export earnings are at risk.   Counting small fish in big ponds, or rare birds in remoteforests, involves substantial guesswork. In some countries, localauthorities accept bribes to skew data, wildlife experts say.   Even with the obtrusive African elephant, tracked from the airand on the ground by experienced scientists, wide discord persistsover census estimates.   The accepted figure is 625,000, the findings of a recentextensive survey. Iain Douglas-Hamilton of Kenya, an experiencedcounter who took part in the survey, prefers 609,000.   Some specialists in Zimbabwe and South Africa, who fought hardagainst an ivory ban to allow culling from their controlled herds,put the number near a million.   But Pierre Pfeffer of the Museum of Natural History in Paris,who has surveyed Central African forests, puts the total at400,000. He says East African experts overestimate forest herds.   Conservationists acknowledge the ivory victory was easierbecause the elephant falls into what they call the spotted-catcategory. Most vulnerable species are in the rhino category.   Ivory, like spotted cat fur, is valued for its visibility andcan be driven out of fashion with negative publicity. Rhino horn,however, is valuable when ground up into unrecognizable powder.   Only experts recognize many rare birds, reptiles and fish, andconsumers continue to buy them. Primates sold for research are notvulnerable to fashion trends.   Scientists say curbing harmful trade is especially important nowbecause wildlife is under serious threat from habitat destructionin most of parts of the world.   The World Resources Institute, along with the U.N. EnvironmentProgram and the World Conservation Union, launched a major campaignto preserve biodiversity, the vital interplay of species in nature.   One-fourth of the world's plants and animals face extinctionwithin 25 to 50 years if losses continue at the present rate, theinstitute said.   ``The impact of such losses on human well-being is potentiallydevastating,'' said the institute's president, James Gustave Speth.``No longer is it acceptable to merely slow the rate ofdestruction.''   But conservationists contend international mechanisms are fartoo lax to control trade.   In one recent case, British police arrested a notorious smugglerknown as the ``Raider of the Orchid.'' He served six weeks in jailand paid a fine of $4,200.   New Scientist magazine said of the case: ``Dealers in rareplants must be laughing all the way back to the jungle ... and thecause of conservation has been set back decades.''   At the recent endangered species meeting, environmentalistgroups accused Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe of conflict ofinterest for financing CITES' ivory unit with contributions fromivory traders.   Earlier, Van Note testified in the U.S. Congress that CITES wasfailing in its mission because of ``underfunding, inadequatestaffing and poor management.''   Lapointe denied any wrongdoing but agreed CITES was hamstrung byscant resources and faulty data from some member governments.Infraction reports catalog widespread flouting of internationalguidelines.   Opening the CITES session Oct. 9, Prince Bernhard of theNetherlands, a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, criticizedglobal efforts to control trade.   He won applause by declaring: ``If there is any doubt ... on anyissue ... you must give the benefit of the doubt to the survival ofthe species. Don't forget, once a species has gone, it has goneforever.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 5</NOTE></DOC>
