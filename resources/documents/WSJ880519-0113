The money eventually was accounted for, but in just 64 minutes last Friday, the government charged, an employee working in First Chicago's wire transfer operation was able to move about $70 million in three separate chunks -- simply by calling his accomplices at a Southside Chicago home for confirmation instead of the offices of three big customers.    Banking officials in recent years have grown concerned that their increasing use of computers and electronic movement of money make them vulnerable to high-technology fraud by so-called hackers. But the government's complaint filed in federal court here shows the potential for huge theft with no technology at all.    The First Chicago employee, Gabriel Taylor, had told the other men what secret responses the bank required customers to make to release funds through wire transfer, according to the complaint. The transfers were made Friday morning between 8:30 and 9:34, the government said.    By Tuesday night, the 27-year-old Mr. Taylor was cooperating with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and taped conversations in which he and two alleged accomplices discussed the scheme, the government said.    Mr. Taylor, a resident of Chicago, wasn't arrested and is in contact with authorities. However, four men were arrested and two more were being sought, including one man authorities know only as &quot;the Reverend.&quot; The defendants couldn't be reached for comment.    All seven men were charged with three counts of wire fraud by U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas here, who said the investigation is continuing and that the case would go before a federal grand jury.    First Chicago, the nation's 10th-largest bank holding company, said neither the bank, nor its customers would lose any money. However, its First National Bank of Chicago unit yesterday in federal court in Manhattan filed suit against Chase Manhattan Bank, an Austrian bank and the seven defendants in the government's case seeking the return of $19.8 million, which First Chicago said Chase has refused to turn over thus far.    The scheme was hatched in a series of meetings during the two weeks before May 13, the government said. Armand Moore, 30 years old from Detroit, known as &quot;the Chairman,&quot; was named as the &quot;ringleader&quot; by Mr. Valukas. Mr. Moore is related to a Chicago resident, Herschel Bailey, 30, who knew a First Chicago employee, Otis Wilson, 30, who knew Mr. Taylor, the wire transfer worker, according to the government.    It further alleged: Mr. Taylor gave the others confidential information on First Chicago accounts of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Allegis Corp.'s United Airlines unit, and Brown-Forman Corp., and he arranged to be the person in the wire transfer operation designated to make confirming calls back to customers, as required by bank procedures. First Chicago received calls from persons purporting to be with those three customers, asking for transfers of $24 million, $25 million and $19.8 million, respectively. All three asked the money to go to Austrian banks through either Chase Manhattan or Citicorp in New York.    Mr. Gabriel, rather than calling officials of the customers, the government said, called his accomplices at the Chicago home, who repeated the correct confirmation language, and the wire transfers were made. Mr. Valukas and First Chicago wouldn't comment, but apparently the confirmation calls are taped or somehow monitored.    The government is still trying to find out if the group had other accomplices; the transfers were made to accounts of Focobank and Creditanstalt, both in Vienna, to be credited to accounts of Lord Investment Inc., an individual named Walter Newman and GTL Industries, the government said.    The alleged scheme was discovered when First Chicago told Merrill Lynch it had an overdraft and Merrill Lynch disagreed, leading bank officials to check the discrepancy and then look for others.    The four men arrested include Messrs. Moore, Bailey, Wilson and Neil Jackson, 31, of Detroit. They were held without bond pending a hearing Friday in federal court here. The wire fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of five years each, plus a potential fine.    Meanwhile, a Chase spokesman said the $19.8 million is being held in an escrow account until the conflicting claims to the money are &quot;sorted out.&quot; A hearing on the matter is expected later this week.    ---   Ann Hagedorn in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
