The director of the only hotel in Stepanakert said all butessential services were shut down today because of a strike.   ``The bread factory and the milk factory are working. The othersare not working. Everyone is sitting at home,'' the director of theKarabakh Hotel said in a telephone interview. He said he was anethnic Armenian but refused to give his name.   About 30 percent of Stepanakert's public transport was shutdown, he said. Communist Party representatives in the city calledworkers to meetings at factories today and urged them to return towork Tuesday, he said.   Stepanakert is the largest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainlyArmenian region in the republic of Azerbaijan which activists areseeking to unite with Armenia. At least 32 people have died inethnic violence between Armenians and Azeris since protests beganin February.   Armenian activists have said a general strike began Wednesday inparts of Nagorno-Karabakh.   Pravda, the Communist Party daily, reported today the strikesand unrest in Azerbaijan have disrupted the economy and cost theregion millions of dollars in lost revenues.   The Communist Party daily said action by Armenianis has``aggravated the economic situation not only in the autonomousregion but also, partly, in the entire republic.''      Pravda said the auto and trucking industries alone lost about$6.5 million in January and February. The railway industry lostabout $360,000.   The article gave little indication about how the money was lostbut quoted a railway official in Azerbaijan as saying freight carshad not been unloaded.   The official, Garik Sarkisyan, was quoted by Pravda as sayingthe situation was ``bad'' and ``loss of time and money has becomethe usual thing.''   Pravda said Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian republic, was``relatively calm'' with no incidents over the weekend ``connectedwith national relations.''   Moscow dissidents, in telephone contact during the weekend withArmenian sources, described Yerevan as ``a dead city,'' with peoplestaying off the streets to protest a government crackdown on publicdemonstrations.   The official press acknowledged that most businesses were closedin Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, over theweekend, but gave no information on the situation this morning.   According to various reports from dissident and official sourcesover the weekend, the general strike appeared to have taken placein Stepanakert, but in other areas most businesses were open.   An administrator of the Yerevan Hotel, who spoke on condition ofanonymnity, said the city's businesses were open today. Other callsto Yerevan did not go through.   Western reporters have been barred from the region, andtelephone service has been largely cut off.   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, including Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev and other members of the top leadership,called last week for improvement of social and economic conditionsin the contested area, but it did not deal directly with theannexation issue.   Activists interpreted that as a rejection of their demands andcalled for a general strike.   Tass said today the Communist Party Central Committee andgovernment's Council of Ministers approved plans for constructionof more schools _ including Armenian schools _ in Nagorno-Karabakhand other regions of Azerbaijain where ethnic Armenians live.</TEXT></DOC>
