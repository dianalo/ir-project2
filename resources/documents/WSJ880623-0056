Liven up your weekend with this state-of-the-art nature special, which features assorted species of serpents swallowing bulky prey, shooting jets of venom, lurking about in deep water, and (of course) shedding their skins.    Saturday, June 25, 8:30-9 p.m. EDT, on NBC: &quot;The Big Five.&quot; What does this one-shot network sitcom about sex roles among suburban kids have in common with last year's charming Swedish film, &quot;My Life as a Dog&quot;? Their director, the aptly named Lasse Hallstrom. Judge for yourself whether his cinematic talent has survived the transition to American TV.    Saturday, June 25, 10:30-11:30 p.m. EDT, on HBO (repeated on June 27 and 30): &quot;The Best of Not Necessarily the News.&quot; Highlights from the past five years of cable TV's news-spoof series.    Sundays, June 26-Aug. 14, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): &quot;National Audubon Society Specials.&quot; If the makers of this acclaimed nature show must assign a celebrity narrator to each species, they could at least find a good match. For instance, instead of Robert Redford for grizzly bears, they should get Ed Asner. It's OK to have Richard Crenna for wood storks, but . . . Johnny Carson for whales?    Sunday, June 26, 10-11 p.m. and 2-3 a.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E: &quot;Harold Prince: From 'Follies' to 'Phantom.'&quot; On the eve of the opening of his latest producing/directing triumph, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera,&quot; Aandamp;E taped this leisurely interview with the Phenomenon of Broadway.    Sunday, June 26, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Ghosts of '87.&quot; For viewers who prefer the phantoms of political philosophy, Cliff Robertson acts and narrates sketches showing the human side of 10 framers of the U.S. Constitution.    Tuesday, June 28, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;My Husband Is Going to Kill Me.&quot; This presentation of &quot;Frontline&quot; reveals the weak spots in the legal system with regard to protecting the victims of domestic violence, by detailing the appalling case of Pamela Guenther, a Denver woman unable to prevent her own murder.    Wednesday, June 29, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Native Son.&quot; Released last year in theaters, this &quot;American Playhouse&quot; film attempts to adapt Richard Wright's searing novel about the ravages of ghetto life in Depression-era Chicago. But it doesn't capture the feeling of the period -- the soundtrack plays post-modernist jazz. More important, it doesn't provide a dramatic equivalent for the novel's preponderance of interior monologue -- the complex but secretive agony of the main character, Bigger Thomas, gets reduced to a collection of cryptic expressions on the face of the actor, Victor Love.    Saturdays, July 2-Aug. 6, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS (Thursdays, July 7-Aug. 13, midnight-1:30 a.m. EDT, on WNET/Thirteen): &quot;Summer Night Music.&quot; Six film portraits of musical currents of the type that fertilize the mainstream without joining it: Ruben Blades's salsa; Al Green's black gospel; Sonny Rollin's jazz saxophone; Gil Scott-Heron's politicized poetry and songs; Jamaican reggae; and traditional Hawaiian folk music. (More in Monday's column.)    Sunday, July 3, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;The Second Annual Star-Spangled Celebration.&quot; The pop stars will be popping at this Fourth of July eve extravaganza held in St. Louis (with taped performances from other cities). Every now and then, Barbara Bush and other supporters of Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS) will take a moment to get serious about teaching everyone to read.    Monday, July 4, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;A Capitol Fourth 1988.&quot; More festivities from the lawn of the U.S. Capitol, featuring the National Symphony Orchestra and the patriotic music of Irving Berlin.    Tuesdays, July 5-Sept. 6, various times (usually 9-11 p.m. or 10-11 p.m. EDT), on PBS: &quot;P.O.V.&quot; The title is a film industry abbreviation for &quot;point of view.&quot; In this series showcasing 10 independently produced documentaries chosen from more than 500 submissions, let's hope a variety of angles and takes on the world are represented. </TEXT></DOC>
