After the U.S. government learned of the meeting, Secretary ofState George Shultz told Syria that the expert, Paul Jureidini, inno way represented the government, the program reported Thursday.Shultz also told Jureidini to end any such contacts.   A spokesman for Vice President Bush's campaign, Mark Goodin,denied that Jureidini's Aug. 16 meeting was in any way sanctioned bythe campaign. As late as July, Jureidini served as an unpaidconsultant on the Middle East to the campaign, ``Nightline'' said.   ``Nightline'' also reported that the release last month ofhostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian professor who is a legalresident of the United States, followed third-party contacts betweenthe United States and Iran.   The intermediary was West German Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher, the program said.   Jureidini, who according to ``Nightline'' has been a frequentPentagon consultant and has top-level U.S. security clearance, saidon the program that he told his Syrian hosts during the meeting inDamascus that he was acting on his own.   He said he did not consider his meeting improper since he wasacting as a private citizen. Joining Jureidini at the meeting washis partner, Ronald McLaurin.   ``Nightline,'' quoting Syrian sources, reported that during themeeting Jureidini and his hosts discussed options for securing therelease of the nine American hostages and what the impact of theirrelease would be on the U.S. presidential election.   Before the release of Singh, Shultz used Genscher to tell Iranthat the U.S. hostages must be freed if there is to be real progressin improving U.S.-Iranian relations, ``Nightline'' reported.   Following this contact, substantial pressure was exerted on theHezbollah, the radical group in Lebanon believed to be holding thehostages, the program said. That pressure led to Singh's release, itsaid.   Afterward, the U.S. government sent word to Iran via the Japanesegovernment that all the U.S. hostages must be released, and thatthere would be no deal and no negotiations, ``Nightline'' reported.   The program quoted Iranian officials as saying they consideredthat response an insult; that Iran was not trying to make a deal,only to start a process that would lead to the release of the otherhostages.   From the Iranian perspective, the Singh release was a gesturethat could have led to more releases, ``Nightline'' said. But theU.S. response, in the Iranian view, resulted in the door slammingshut, it reported.   U.S. officials told the program that the response was consistentwith U.S. policy on the hostages.   ``Nightline'' reported that Iran said it was contacted about therelease of the hostages by numerous people who claimed to representeither the U.S. government or the presidential campaigns of Bush orMichael Dukakis.   Spokesmen for both campaigns denied they had authorized any suchcontacts, and Iran refused to provide names or other details, theshow reported.   The number of such contacts was so great that in October, theIranian government complained in an official message to the U.S.government, ``Nightline'' reported.   In early October, Shultz announced that such contacts wereunauthorized and that those making them should ``butt out'' and letthe State Department handle the hostage situation.</TEXT></DOC>
