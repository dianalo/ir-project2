Divisions have hurt the U.S-backed guerrillas in their campaignto topple the Kabul government after the last Soviet troops pulledout in February.   However, a source in the Moscow-supported government, quotedmilitary officials as saying officers were worried that thefractious rebels are now beginning to join forces.   Several guerrillas factions reportedly fought together tocapture the south-central city of Sore Kallin. The city is thehometown of the late Noor Mohammad Taraki, founder of the rulingDemocratic People's Party of Afghanistan and the country's firstCommunist ruler.   Thousands of rebels attacked the Ghazni province city last week,according to the government source and two truck drivers whoarrived in Kabul from the region today.   By Friday, rebel forces had routed the 3,000-member governmentgarrison, they said. The truck drivers, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded but said theyknew nothing of government casualties.   Rebels captured many government weapons, including thousands ofAK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades and mortars, the governmentsource said.   Taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in an April1978 coup that touched off the country's civil war. Although Tarakiwas ousted and killed in another coup in September 1979, thegarrison had remained among the strongest in Ghazni province, thegovernment source said.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said rebelshave been trying to knock out the garrison for several years. ``Thevictory was the result of their unity,'' he said.   One truck driver said that after the rebel victory, severalmullahs, or Moslem clergymen, were hung upside down from trucksafter they were accused of supporting the government.   The government source said cooperation by separate guerrillaforces on a blockade of the government's main supply route from theSoviet Union also indicated new unity among rebel factions.   He said forces loyal to Ahmad Shah Massoud and others led byGulbuddin Hekmatyar had been co-ordinating the 10-day blockade onthe Salang Highway, the northern route out of Kabul.   The source said Massoud, a relatively liberal Moslem, had notpreviously united forces with Hekmatyar, a fundamentalist Moslem.   Rebels have also been blockading the three others highways outof Kabul, the capital, according to private truckers.   The blockade was forcing up food prices and raising fears ofshortages. More than 2,000 trucks were said to be stuck on SalangHighway north of the fighting.   In addition, the rebels also stepped up rocketing on thecapital's airport. Soldiers said at least six rockets crashed downthere in the early morning today, but no casualties were reported.   However, they said air shipments from the Soviet Union wereslowing down to about 10 a day from the usual 30.   Government officials have said if land and air routes are shut,the capital would be able to survive for about one month. Silosholding about 50,000 tons of flour are said to be full, and thegovernment has also stockpiled gasoline.</TEXT></DOC>
