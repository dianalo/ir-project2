(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Stormy weather forced MartinMarietta to delay the first commercial launch of its Titan 3 rocketcarrying British and Japanese communications satellites.   The attempt was called off Friday about two hours before theplanned liftoff when a storm dumped heavy rain on the launch area.   The delay will last at least until next week because a Deltarocket scheduled for Sunday carries a military navigation satellitefor the Defense Department and has priority.   Officials said the Titan could be delayed until later inDecember because it also has lower priority than both the Titan IImissile launch scheduled next week and the flight of the SpaceShuttle Columbia planned for Dec. 18.   The flight was to have marked Martin Marietta's entry into thehighly competitive commercial launch business. Liftoff had beenpostponed on Thursday night by a computer software problem.</TEXT></DOC>
