A wind power plant (22 m above ground) supplies electric powerneeded for the electrolysis of tap water into hydrogen and oxygen. Thehydrogen produced is a high-grade energy source used for space heatingpurposes, water heating, cooking and as a fuel for vehicles. Detailsare given of the electrolytic process and of the safe stock keeping andstorage hydrogen in iron-titanium tanks which avoid the formation ofoxyhydrogen gases (metal powder inside the tank chemically combines thehydrogen) as hydrogen is drawn for power generation. A two hours overnightfilling supplies the vehicle with energy for a 100 km drive. In spiteof its still insufficient economic qualities the decentralized energysupply system decribed is offering feasible chances which, provided theirfurther development will turn out to be a profitable alternative.
