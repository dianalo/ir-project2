Taylor Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. estimated that its negative net worth last year widened to $11.6 billion from $6.3 billion in 1986, agency officials said.    To reach the 1987 figure, officials estimated that the cost of merging or liquidating 204 hopelessly insolvent savings and loans had climbed to $15.3 billion by last Dec. 31, up $4.8 billion from a year earlier. The staff said these amounts should be counted on the FSLIC's books as a contingent liability.    The number was consistent with estimates of Sandamp;L rescue costs made earlier this year by Danny Wall, chairman of the FSLIC's parent, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. But it was far smaller than estimates from private analysts and economists that ranged between $40 billion and $60 billion.    Bank Board officials said they figured the price tag would jump to $21.8 billion if the FSLIC had to rescue all 510 Sandamp;Ls that were insolvent last year under generally accepted accounting standards.    Agency officials discussed the figures in a hastily called news conference, amid mounting media speculation over the annual audit of the FSLIC by Congress's General Accounting Office.    Bank Board member Lawrence White said the growing insolvency &quot;has not made any difference in our ability to go forward&quot; and deal with insolvent savings institutions. He conceded that the interest rate on bonds issued by the Bank Board has increased relative to similar Treasury offerings, but he attributed that to a lull in Japanese investing rather than concern about the FSLIC.    The GAO has been arguing that the thrift insurer is more deeply insolvent than it is saying, though the difference is less than $2 billion, according to one official. The GAO and the Bank Board are conferring this week on the numbers. A failure by the GAO to certify the FSLIC's 1987 financial statement could further erode public confidence in the insurer.    James Barth, chief economist for the Bank Board, said the board might consider listing the $21.8 billion figure for thrift-rescue costs in a footnote to the FSLIC's 1987 financial statement. But he insisted that only the $15.3 billion number represented &quot;probable and estimable&quot; losses qualified to be counted as the FSLIC's contingent liability.    Meanwhile, officials at the Bank Board and White House Office of Management and Budget denied any knowledge of a reported plan to liquidate the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. as an option to raise money for Sandamp;L rescue operations. </TEXT></DOC>
