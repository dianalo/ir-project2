Aided by fat trading revenue, the nation's securitiesfirms reported third-quarter pretax profits of $1.28 billion,according to New York Stock Exchange data released yesterday.That's 42% above analysts' expectations of about $900million, and reverses the $188 million pretax loss in 1990'sthird quarter.</LP><TEXT>   The totals are more impressive because profits were pulleddown by the $200 million pretax charge taken by SalomonBrothers Inc. for potential liablity from itsTreasury-auction bidding scandal.   For the nine months, Wall Street securities firms havereported pretax profit of $4 billion. Within sight: theannual record of $5.5 billion set in 1986. Many brokeragefirms have thrived in the current quarter, with record stockprices and the bond market rallying amid the FederalReserve's recent discount-rate cut.   Still, &quot;at this point a new milestone seems improbable, atleast in total dollar terms,&quot; said John Keefe, an analyst forLipper Analytical Securities Corp. But Mr. Keefe said thatwith the securities industry taking far less risk these daysthan in 1986, brokerage firms did very well in 1991.   Indeed, this year's profit rebound has triggered a surgein the shares of brokerage companies. Yesterday, forinstance, securities brokers recorded the eighth-biggest gainamong industry groups; the Dow Jones securities brokers groupjumped 112.7% so far this year.   Share prices of Quick andamp; Reilly Group Inc. climbed 8.8%;A.G. Edwards andamp; Inc., 7.6%; Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., 4.6%;PaineWebber Group Inc., 4.3%; and Morgan Stanley Group Inc.,4.7%.   After taxes, the 322 Big Board member securities firmsthat do business with the public reported third-quarterprofit of $842 million, compared with a $124 million loss inthe year-earlier period. The after-tax profit represented an8.9% annual return on the firms' average net worth, or assetsminus liabilities. About 74% of the firms were profitable inthe third quarter, the Big Board said.   Securities-firm assets -- which include cash, receivables,securities and property -- rose 14.3% in the third quarter,to a record $631.32 billion. Capital -- ownership equity andsubordinated liabilities -- rose 8.4%, to $39.12 billion.   Meanwhile, Big Board specialist firms reported net incomeof $14 million for the third quarter, reversing a $19 millionloss in the year-earlier period.</TEXT></DOC>
