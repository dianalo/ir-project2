Unfortunately,the impact on performance of many design alternatives is not yet wellunderstood. This thesis proposes an analytical performance model of data-basesystems that provides a means of quantitative comparison of design alternatives.Four levels of abstraction are distinguished for design choices, modelsof representation, and related performance measures. Queuing-networkmodels are used at the bottom, most concrete level. Several subproblemswithin the layered framework are studied in detail, including schemaand internal-access-plans models and a performance model for data-basebuffer management. The author also extends and refines several existingmodeling techniques such as schema-to-internal data-base mappings andmodels of internal data-base structures. All the proposed submodels areintegrated within a generalized framework for data-base performance analysis,named PROPHET, with detailed models of computation at the four layersof abstraction.</TEXT></DOC>
