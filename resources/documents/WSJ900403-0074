Clark Jr.</HL><DATE>04/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C11</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><LP>   With many banks in deep trouble, why would anyone suggestabolishing reserve requirements? Actually, there couldn't bea better time.   The idea that banks should put aside some money just incase depositors start beating on their doors has a longhistory. Robert Auerbach, in his textbook, &quot;Financial Marketsand Institutions,&quot; says reserve requirements were firstimposed by the state of Virginia in 1837. In 1864 thecoverage of requirements was greatly expanded when theNational Bank Act stipulated that banks were to hold reservesagainst deposit liabilities.</LP><TEXT>   Nearly everyone thought that the aim was to ensure thesafety of deposits and the soundness of the banking system.Most people now recognize that setting requirements at thelevels that have existed is a little bit like requiring everyhome owner to keep a pail of water handy for future fires. Inthe real world the requirements proved to be useless againstthe bank runs of the early 1930s.   There was a way around that problem. Over the years,Irving Fisher, Milton Friedman and some other economists haveurged 100% reserve banking. It would give the depositors muchgreater safety, and also change the existing system sodrastically that the idea has never gotten anywhere. In anycase, deposit insurance now largely protects depositors,although it hasn't been the best of news to taxpayers.   For many years, required reserves were supposed to play arole in monetary policy. If the Federal Reserve raisedrequirements, banks would have smaller free reserves andwould be able to lend less. The money supply would grow moreslowly. Supposedly, it worked the other way, too. If thebanks had more reserves they would make more loans.   In 1936, however, the banks had a lot of excess reservesbut weren't lending very much. So the Fed figured they didn'tneed the reserves; it jacked up requirements. The banks,frightened by the Depression, cut their loans, trying tooffset the higher requirements. So the Fed raisedrequirements again, and the banks slowed their lending evenmore. The result was the recession of 1937-38, an event thatsoured many people on using required reserves for monetarypolicy.   For years the Fed has hardly used the requirements at all,possibly because of this demonstration of how powerful theyare. The rules have been modified occasionally. From 1969until the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and MonetaryControl Act of 1980, reserve requirements allowed banks tobase reserves not on current deposits but on deposits twoweeks earlier. This greatly increased the volatility ofinterest rates and monetary policy.   But the requirements persist. Why? Some people suggestthat cutting or reducing the requirements would cut revenueof the Treasury and increase the budget deficit. The Fed buysa lot of Treasury securities and gives a large portion of itsearnings to the Treasury. That in itself is one of thestrange aspects of Fed history; the payments to the Treasuryare supposed to be for the privilege of issuing FederalReserve notes.   However, Jerry Jordan, chief economist of First InterstateBank of Los Angeles, remarks that the arguments thatrequirements should be retained to make money for theTreasury &quot;should be rejected as a cynical response thatplaces short-term political objectives ahead of the creationof a more sound and efficient financial sector.&quot;   Other major countries appear to be deciding that reserverequirements serve no useful purpose. Britain has arequirement of only one-half of 1%, a fact that is causingcentral banks elsewhere in Europe to lower their requirementsbecause of competitive forces associated with the monetaryunification of Europe. &quot;In 1988,&quot; Mr. Jordan notes, &quot;theSwiss National Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australiaeliminated reserve requirements altogether. The Bank ofCanada also is in the process of eliminating reserverequirements because they are no longer viewed as essentialfor the conduct of monetary policy.&quot;   It would be enough of an argument against reserverequirements to show that they are essentially useless. Thestatute books are cluttered with too many rules that achieveno worthwhile purpose. But the argument goes beyond that.   On the one hand, government regulators are pressingfinancial institutions to increase their capital. Thispressure makes sense, since many institutions have hadserious problems, at a time when they are facing anincreasing global demand for their services.   What doesn't make sense is that at the same time thegovernment is imposing reserve requirements, what amount tosevere taxes on the institutions. Their reserves at the Fedearn no interest.   Mr. Jordan urges that the Federal Reserve announce aprogram of reducing reserve requirements from the current 12%to the statutory minimum of 8%. Then the Fed should seek newlegislation to permit reducing the requirement to zero or, atmost, to a level that doesn't exceed the minimum needed forpurposes of clearing.   At the moment, unfortunately, the Fed appears to be movingin the wrong direction by proposing that the existingexcessive reserve requirements be extended to foreigndeposits at U.S. bank subsidiaries and branches. &quot;That idea,&quot;Mr. Jordan says, &quot;is a nonstarter. International competitivefactors will not permit it.&quot;   If the Fed wants to reduce the inequity between foreignand domestic deposits, the easy way to do it is to reduce therequirement for domestic deposits, not raise it for foreignaccounts.   Perhaps there was a time when reserve requirements made acertain amount of sense. If so, that time has clearly comeand gone.</TEXT></DOC>
