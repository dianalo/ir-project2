Rebel leaders made public their proposals at a news conferencemoments before renewing talks in Mexico City with representatives ofPresident Alfredo Cristiani's rightist administration.   But both sides said they had scant hope of negotiating an earlyend to the war, which has cost more than 70,000 lives. Threeprevious attempts to negotiate peace from 1984 to 1987 ended indeadlock.   Joaquin Villalobos, a top leader of the leftist Faradundo MartiNational Liberation Front guerrillas, and seven other rebel chiefsdistributed a document outlining their proposals, which they saidthey will present to the government.   The rebels called for a negotiated cease-fire by Nov. 15 at thelatest but said it must be accompanied by the reforms. ``Thisimplies great risks (for the rebels,'' Villalobos said.   He said the Salvadoran people are tired of fighting and, ``We areconscious the war has to end.''   The proposals called for a U.N. observer team to monitor an endto political repression, constitutional and land reforms and talksto advance the 1991 legislative and municipal elections.   Also proposed was the creation of a new Supreme Court. The rebelsconsider the present court dominated by rightists.   Villalobos said the rebels plan ``to integrate itself into thecountry's civil and political life'' gradually, as the reforms arebeing carried out.   There was no immediate public response from the Salvadorangovernment.   The previous negotiations were held during the centristadministration of Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte.   When he took office June 1, Cristiani invited the guerrillas tolay down their arms and engage in talks with his administration. Therebels and government have called a temporary cease-fire for thepeace talks.   The rebels contend that despite regular elections since 1982, ElSalvador has only a democratic veneer. They say civil liberties aresystematically violated and that citizens risk their lives bypublicly supporting socialism.   Human rights groups say most victims of the war were killed byrightist death squads from 1979 to 1984. They say such slayings havediminished considerably but not ceased.   Rebels say the 56,000-member armed forces should reduced as thewar ends, and they demand that rightists be weeded out.</TEXT></DOC>
