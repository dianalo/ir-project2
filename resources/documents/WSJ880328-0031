Mossberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MON TNM </IN><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a significant advance for the sweeping trade bill, the Reagan administration has told congressional negotiators it will accept a measure authorizing the president to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies on national security grounds.    Administration officials and House-Senate conferees on the trade bill agreed on the compromise provision late last week. The administration's acceptance increases the chances that a more controversial provision, which would require foreigners to disclose their substantial investment in the U.S., will be dropped from the trade bill.    Formal action on both provisions is expected this week, as lawmakers try to wrap up the trade-bill conference before Congress begins its Easter recess.    If the latest compromise results in dropping the more controversial provision, prospects will improve for producing a bill that President Reagan can accept. However, there are several other issues -- such as language governing plant closings and the removal of presidential discretion in responding to trade complaints -- that remain unresolved.    Thus, it's still too early to determine whether congressional Democrats will water down the legislation enough to attract the president's signature. Administration strategists are still prepared to recommend a veto if important changes aren't made.    In last week's agreement, the administration and congressional officials agreed to delete wording that would give the president the authority to ban a merger threatening &quot;essential commerce.&quot; Instead, the negotiators agreed to authorize such action only if the foreign takeover jeopardized national security, which could, however, be broadly defined by the president.    The provision is aimed at situations similar to last year's proposed merger, since abandoned, of Fujitsu Ltd. and Schlumberger Ltd.'s Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. unit. Currently, the president can stop a foreign takeover only if it would violate antitrust laws or if he declares a national emergency.    Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas) has been pushing a provision that would require foreigners to register their significant investments. The Reagan administration and some in Congress fear this could shrink foreign investment at a time when the U.S. needs such capital. The administration and those lawmakers will argue this week that the takeover provision agreed to last week is a more moderate way of preventing any harmful foreign investment in the U.S.    According to a Reagan administration official familiar with the issue, the compromise amendment was acceptable because it would leave the president with total discretion to block or even investigate a foreign investment.    Further, the official said, action under the amendment couldn't even begin until all currently available review mechanisms, including national security laws, have been exhausted. And finally, the official said, even a president inclined to scotch a foreign takeover would have to prove it endangered national security, and couldn't rely just on economic criteria.    As a result, the official said, the amendment adds little to the existing interagency and Pentagon review procedures. Even without presidential power to block acquisitions, these mechanisms helped scare Fujitsu out of its planned acquisition of Fairchild and have required changes in other foreign transactions in which classified work was under way at companies being acquired.    By contrast, the administration believes the Bryant disclosure language would severely chill foreign investment in the U.S. -- even though it doesn't provide for a government veto -- because foreign investors are wary of disclosure. The Bryant language, which the White House also fears could invite retaliation against U.S. investors abroad, is a red flag to the White House and Treasury Secretary James Baker, and might prompt a veto of the bill.    Nevertheless, the decision to accept any language appearing to threaten foreign investment could upset financial-market traders and foreign officials. Both groups often fail to grasp the political nuance of such congressional horse trading or to learn the details before reacting, sometimes violently, to sketchy descriptions.    In some quarters, the move will be interpreted as the beginning of a trend toward limiting foreign investment in the U.S., even though the White House and congressional leaders oppose such prohibitions. </TEXT></DOC>
