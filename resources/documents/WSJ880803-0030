Mr. Takeda was trying to run a textile plant in a Thai village where the workers went on strike every month, he says. They demanded central air conditioning, sightseeing trips to Japan and other perks he considered ridiculous. He grew convinced that communist agitators were putting them up to their actions. Finally, he locked everybody out. Scuffles followed, and two workers were killed. The villagers believed Mr. Takeda had ordered the deaths.    &quot;I had to put up advertisements everywhere {offering rewards for the capture of those responsible} to save my life,&quot; he says.    Finally, he left Thailand. Back in Japan, he went to work for Apollo Electronics, a maker of transistors. Last year, Apollo decided to move transistor production offshore, and Mr. Takeda got the task of touring five Asian nations and picking the site.    He chose Thailand.    &quot;Luckily, the Thai people changed their minds,&quot; he says, sitting in new headquarters in Bangkok, the capital. &quot;There are still communists here, but they have no power. The Thai people don't want to join. They want to work for their own goals.&quot;    Mr. Takeda's story shows in microcosm what is happening all over Thailand. A two-year wave of Japanese and other investment is pushing the economy ahead so fast that some government officials claim Thailand will become Asia's next newly industrialized country, or NIC, joining the ranks of the so-called four tigers of Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, whose export-driven economies have brought them prosperity.    While Thailand isn't a free-wheeling, multi-party democracy, it has been holding regular elections since 1979 and provides a wide degree of personal freedom for its citizens. It has a king who reinforces political stability. In the past decade, the country has come a long way from the days when military coups, albeit mostly bloodless ones, were common. The military's last attempt to seize power, in 1985, failed.    Moreover, the year after it resumed popular elections, Thailand carried out a successful amnesty for communist guerrillas, luring many of them back into civilian life and averting a right-wing backlash against surrendering insurgents.    Along with political liberalization has come economic liberalization. The government of outgoing Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda has pursued pro-business policies, recently beginning a push to privatize some state enterprises. It has also defied government unions that want to keep the country's harbors in state hands, announcing that big ports now being built will be run by a private concern.    The other NICs got where they are through extremely fast growth of manufactured exports, sustained over many years. Thailand's manufactured-export track record is too short to prove anything yet, but by most economic measures, the country is moving in the right direction.    No one would have predicted it 10 years ago. Back then, Mr. Takeda's fear was the conventional wisdom: Thailand would be the last domino. The governments of neighboring Cambodia and of South Vietnam fell in 1975. In Laos, the leftist Pathet Lao movement consolidated power the same year. The U.S. was warming to China, which Thailand deeply distrusted. And Thailand itself was bouncing bloodily from civil unrest to military crackdown and back again.    Today, the picture is radically different:   --Economic growth rebounded to 6.8% last year, after a couple of bad years when oil prices rose and the currency grew overvalued. For Thailand, a bad year is one in which the economy grows by, say, 3.5%.    --Output, which once mostly consisted of rice and a few other commodities, has diversified. The government says agriculture now accounts for just 16% of national output, down from 30% in 1975. Manufacturing is growing healthily.    --Exports began to soar in 1986 and haven't stopped.    --Foreign debt seems to be under control again, after a few years in which borrowing grew too quickly. The government slammed a lid on public-sector borrowing in 1984.    When asked to explain what happened over the years to make the insurgency fade and investment surge, different people in Thailand focus on different things. Mr. Takeda, for one, thinks the Thais turned away from communism after the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1979 and Thailand was flooded with refugees from its communist neighbors.    Development technicians say it was the arrival of electricity and irrigation in the impoverished countryside that made the rural poor less apt to rebel. Government planners talk about the role of economic planning in shepherding Thailand out of an inward-looking development model and toward export promotion.    Free-marketeers say the Thai success story really boils down to exchange rates. And, indeed, the most obvious force of economic change for the past two years has been investment by Japanese companies seeking to escape the full force of the strong yen. In 1987, 30 new Japanese businesses began operations here, out of a total of 68 new foreign ventures. (Fifteen of the projects were European, 11 were from Hong Kong, and 10 were from the U.S.) Many more projects are planned. The Thai government says that if Japanese investors go ahead with everything they proposed in January alone, the country would gain more than 3,000 jobs.    Mr. Takeda's case exemplifies the intensified Japanese interest in Thailand. In 1987, he says, Apollo decided it needed to move transistor production out of Japan to cut costs. Apollo's customers -- companies making televisions, cameras, photocopiers and the like -- were all moving out of Japan, and Apollo wanted to follow them.    In his travels, Mr. Takeda evaluated the merits of Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In Singapore, he says, workers seemed scarce and expensive. The Philippines seemed politically unstable. Indonesia was too far from Japan. And in Malaysia, Mr. Takeda was put off by antagonism between the ethnic Chinese and Malays, and by the government's rules that he hire fixed proportions of each.    &quot;Thailand is 95% Buddhist,&quot; he says. &quot;Japan is the same. It's easy to have an understanding.&quot; If the military were to stage yet another coup, it would be &quot;just a small play&quot; and wouldn't threaten the constitutional monarchy, he believes.    Labor costs were also attractive in Thailand. It would have cost Apollo the equivalent of about $4,200 a month to bring a Japanese engineer here. But Thailand is still so poor that a home-grown university graduate will work for just $200 a month. Apollo is hiring 38 of them.    Also working in Thailand's favor is the success of the other four Asian NICs. As their national standards of living have risen, their workers have begun to price themselves out of certain industries.    According to Suphsorn Chayovan, executive vice president of North East Agriculture Co., Taiwan is a case in point. &quot;Taiwan is rich,&quot; he says, and thus, despite its reputation as the producer of Asia's tastiest tomatoes, &quot;no one wants to be a grower&quot; there.    In contrast, Mr. Suphsorn is desperately trying to grow tomatoes in Thailand, even though the blistering heat and farmers' unfamiliarity with the crop have put a damper on his initial efforts. &quot;Thailand still lacks the expertise to grow good tomatoes, but next year, we'll have more practice,&quot; he says. &quot;If the growers have knowledge, have patience, they can do it. Just like Taiwan.&quot;    ---              Thailand: 1987 Economic Signposts    Population                          54 million    Exports                             $14.30 billion    Imports                             $13.50 billion    Nominal GDP                         $48.06 billion    External Debt                       $18.90 billion    Interest Payments    as % of Exports                     9.3%</TEXT></DOC>
