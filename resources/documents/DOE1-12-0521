The firstdeals with computing the effective action for a scalar field model, tothe two loop level. This has been discussed at great length elsewhere.However, the approach used here provides, one hopes, a more coherentpicture of the renormalization procedure. Thus its value is perhaps largelypedagogical. The remainder of the work is concerned with aspects of aformalism, developed by various people over the last twelve years, whichadmits the incorporation of temperature into quantum field theory. Thisis achieved in such a way as to allow the calculation of thermodynamicalquantities using the Feynman rules and diagrams already familiar to particlephysicists. The quantity considered here is the free energy, which isshown to be related to a generalization of the effective potential ofChapter One. Two models are examined; a single real scalar field withphi{sup 4} interaction, and a scalar field interacting with a fermionfield.</TEXT></DOC>
