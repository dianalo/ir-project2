Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><TEXT>   Several major central banks resumed their coordinated intervention in support of the dollar, steering the U.S. currency out of a mild skid in European trading.    By late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was slightly above its levels of late Friday against the Japanese yen and West German mark but still marginally lower against most other major currencies.    Yesterday was the first time that most of the central banks had been in the foreign exchange markets buying dollars since their massive purchases last Monday and Tuesday ignited a sharp rally in the currency. Traders interpreted the resumption of coordinated intervention as a warning against speculation on a dollar decline.    &quot;It was a reminder that they (the central banks) are still around,&quot; Richard E. Witten, vice president, foreign exchange, at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, said.    Traders said the volume of yesterday's intervention didn't approach last week's multibillion-dollar operation. Still, several central banks continued to publicize their activity in the market. The central banks of West Germany, Switzerland and Italy confirmed their efforts to support the dollar, though they withheld details on how much U.S. currency they purchased.    The Bank of England, however, declined to comment on trader reports that it was supporting the dollar through intervention yesterday. The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, reportedly asked some New York banks about dollar exchange rates, and the Bank of Japan made dollar-yen price inquiries in the Tokyo market. But neither of those central banks appeared to be buying dollars, traders said.    The dollar came under pressure overseas as traders began positioning themselves for Friday's report on the November U.S. merchandise trade balance. Market participants generally expect to see a narrowing from the record $17.63 billion trade deficit reported a month ago for October. But even a substantial reduction would still leave a huge deficit.    &quot;A $15 billion deficit to me is a lousy number,&quot; Michael D. Andrews, vice president and foreign exchange economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. &quot;Anything above that would bring the dollar under some downward pressure,&quot; he said.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 128.50 yen, compared with 128.33 late Friday. It traded as low as 127.13 yen in Europe yesterday. The dollar also firmed to 1.6400 marks, compared with 1.6390 late Friday, after reaching an intraday low of 1.6310 marks in Europe.    In early Tokyo trading Tuesday, the dollar held steady near its opening. At midday, the dollar was quoted at 128.33 yen, down slightly from 128.35 yen at the opening. Traders said the sluggish market was due in part to prospects of central bank intervention.    The British pound climbed to $1.8190 from $1.8183 late Friday. The Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and French franc also gained slightly against the U.S. currency.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.80 an ounce to $481.90 in light trading. Estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $482.55 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, Jan. 11, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
