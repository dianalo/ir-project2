The smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected toenvelop the chest of the ailing 4,600-year-old statue as Egyptianauthorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one ofthe world's best-known monuments.   The effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbanedworkers prying rocks from his massive paws, sticking sensors intohis backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle.   Scaffolding first appeared at the Sphinx's right shoulder in thespring of 1988, shortly after a rock broke off and tumbled to theground. More weak spots were discovered, and now the framework isbeing extended across the famous frontal view.   Prime Minister Atef Sedki of Egypt made an official inspectionvisit, seeking to determine whether restoration begun in 1982,which covered the front paws and other portions with concreteblocks, helped or harmed the Sphinx.   ``There's no threat to the Sphinx,'' Sedki said after the visit.But he added: ``Although I'm not a technical man, I can see with myeyes that former restoration work was wrong.   ``The government will not deny any financial support that thenew restoration work requires. The important thing is to save thestatue that symbolizes the Egyptian civilization.''   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,said the latest effort calls for removing all large restorationstones attached since 1982.   Restoration was being done on the Sphinx at least 3,000 yearsago. But Tawfik, climbing atop the front paws, said a keydifference in the current project is that for the first time,restorers will try to ensure that the repaired Sphinx looks likethe Sphinx.   Earlier restorations in the 1980s, he said, simply coatedendangered areas without regard to the shape the ancients carved.   ``There's a 10-centimeter (four-inch) difference in the originalshape of the paws and in restoration stones that cover them,''Tawfik said. ``You can't even imagine how the Sphinx should look. ''   He said the Egyptian-born artist and sculptor Adam Henein hasbeen brought from Paris to help restore the body to its originalform.   ``We're studying hundreds of pictures taken since the middle ofthe last century, even when it was almost totally buried, for cluesto how the Sphinx looked,'' he said.   Concrete blocks have been numbered and are being carried fromthe site as smaller replacement stones from the Giza Plateau areinstalled. Greeks and Romans restoring the monument more than 2,000years ago also used small blocks, and Tawfik said their work isbetter than any by modern restorers.   ``Restoration begun in 1982 proved awfully bad because largestones were used that completely damaged the Sphinx,'' said ZahiHawass, director of the pyramids area.   ``Also, they used cement and gypsum, so now not only are welooking at bad rock that has always been in the Sphinx but also atrock that's been damaged from bad restoration.''   Criticism of the 1980s restoration has been common for years andthe Sphinx has become a political issue as well as a scientific one.   The latest controversy began in mid-November with stories innewspapers speculating that mischief felled the chunk of stone fromthe Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb. 7, 1988.   Tawfik and other experts responded by saying scientists studiedthe rockfall for a year before deciding it occurred in a section oflimestone weakened by salt, wind and other natural phenomena. Thedispute raged for weeks.   The Sphinx is likely to have little peace for quite a while.   ``The Sphinx is like Lebanon, with militias tearing at eachother,'' said Omar el-Arini, a member of the antiquitiesorganization's scientific committee and a science officer at theU.S. Embassy.   ``He's a 50-million-year-old man, because that's how old therock is. How do you restore him? Do you rejuvenate him? Do youtreat his ailments?   ``What's missing here is a general plan.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Dec. 25</NOTE></DOC>
