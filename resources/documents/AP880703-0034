White clouds of tear gas hung over the biblical Via Dolorosa andother parts of Jerusalem's walled Old City as the two-hour battleraged.   At least 15 Palestinians were injured, including eight by teargas, five by beatings and two by rubber bullets, said officials atJerusalem's Mukassad Hospital. Several police officers were hit byrocks, police officials said.   Police said seven Arabs were arrested, and authorities laterclosed most schools in Arab east Jerusalem.   The protests began after Israel's Religious Affairs Ministrylaunched a dig Sunday to clear an ancient underground staircasenear the Temple Mount, a site sacred to both Moslems and Jews.   The Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Haram al Sharif, or NobleEnclosure, houses the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques.   A crowd gathered and Moslem religious leaders, usingloudspeakers, called on Arabs to defend the Temple Mount, sayingthey feared the Israelis would dig a passage to the mosques.   Government officials said the dig would not violate Moslemreligious property.   Massive police reinforcements were rushed to the Old City, andpolice blocked gates and streets leading to it.   Dozens of Palestinian youths, some of them masked, dashed frombehind street corners to throw rocks. Police chased the crowd,firing rubber bullets and tear gas.   An Arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flower-printdress covered with blood. Witnesses said she was hit with a rubberbullet.   The riot was one of the most widespread and violent in eastJerusalem since the Palestinian uprising in the occupiedterritories started Dec. 8. At least 215 Palestinians and fourIsraelis have died in the uprising.   Most of the occupied territories were quiet Sunday, but afirebomb set ablaze an army vehicle in downtown Gaza City. It wasquickly extinguished and soldiers put the area under curfew.   In Jerusalem, government archeologist Dan Bahat said the dig wasintended to open a stairway and clean up part of a more than2,000-year-old tunnel bordering the Temple Mount.   The Temple Mount is also bordered by the Western Wall, the lastremnant of the Second Temple and Judaism's holiest site.   Bahat said the 70-yard-long tunnel links the wall with the ViaDolorosa, which according to Christian tradition was the routeJesus took to the cross. According to Bahat and Arab reports, thecall broadcast from the mosque claimed that ``the Jews planned todig a tunnel'' to the Temple Mount.   Anwar Kkatib, deputy head of the Moslem Supreme Council whichadministers the sites, said Moslem religious officials were awareof plans for the dig but opposed it.   Bahat said the dig was started in coordination with the Moslemauthorities, but Uri Mintzer, spokesman for Religious AffairsMinistry, said Moslem officials were not notified the work wouldstart Sunday.   Jerusalem's adviser on Arab affairs, Amir Cheshin, said it was amistake to start the dig ``without making a pre-arrangement withMoslem authorities.''   Moslem and Israeli officials decided later Sunday to holdfurther talks about the excavation and cover up the dig for thetime being.   Moslems said they want the hole to remain closed. Zevulun Orlev,director general of the Religious Affairs Ministry, said he hopedthe tunnel eventually could be opened as a tourist attraction.</TEXT></DOC>
