Breaking off from the meeting, Mr.Bush went to the telephone -- and called Canadian PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, with whom he had dined the nightbefore. After a several-minute talk about the Persian Gulfcrisis, the president hung up and rejoined the CIA group.   George Bush is handling the gravest crisis of hispresidency exactly the way he has handled foreign policysince his first day in office: through his carefullycultivated personal ties with foreign leaders and the adviceof a tight circle of trusted aides.</LP><TEXT>   That approach seems to be bearing fruit in the unusuallyunited world response to Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein'sinvasion and takeover of Kuwait. While Mr. Bush can't takeall the credit for the broad-based denunciation of Iraq, someanalysts say the results -- from the Soviet Union's decisionto turn back arms shipments to Iraq to Japan's willingness toparticipate in an oil embargo and China's decision to stoparms sales -- stem at least in part from the relationship Mr.Bush has forged with their leaders.   Mr. Bush knows the Saudis' Washington ambassador, PrinceBandar bin Sultan, well and has visited Saudi King Fahd inhis kingdom. That may have helped persuade the Saudis todecide for the first time to accept a large American force intheir country.   &quot;The whole country is seeing now the benefits of hisestablishing these relationships with our allies,&quot; saysRepublican pollster Robert Teeter, a close associate of Mr.Bush.   Within the administration, Mr. Bush has leaned heavily onnational security adviser Brent Scowcroft and on Secretary ofState James Baker and Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, bothof whom he has dispatched on sensitive foreign missions. Alsoinfluential is Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, who also brings the expertise he gained asnational security adviser under President Reagan.   Observers say the president is following his general modeof operation in such matters, taking information from manybut advice from few. &quot;His is not a practice of exclusion,it's one of inclusion,&quot; says Peter Teeley, a former longtimeaide. &quot;He'll bring in these individuals who have expertise inthe areas he needs,&quot; regardless of whether they arehigh-ranking officials. Among other things, the presidentyesterday met with a group of prominent Arab-Americans tohear whatever information they might have about thetension-filled region.   When a decision is required, though, Mr. Bush reverts tohis inner circle in a search for consensus. If there has beenany sharp disagreement so far, the group has managed to keepit to themselves -- though Gen. Powell was reported to bemore insistent than others in the group that a blockade ofIraqi oil required an agreement with Saudi Arabia to allowU.S. military forces there.   As a former CIA director himself, Mr. Bush has kept inclose touch with his old agency during the crisis. CIADirector William Webster, though not in the policy-makinginner circle, has been a frequent conduit for information.Although there has been frequent speculation that Mr. Websterwould be replaced at the CIA, his performance in the currentcrisis could boost his prospects for remaining at leastthrough the end of Mr. Bush's current term; in any event,Bush aides say the president has been particularly pleasedwith the quality of the intelligence he has been receiving.   Mr. Bush's visit yesterday to CIA headquarters was for along-scheduled meeting with the intelligence officers whoprepare his daily briefing; it turned into a discussion ofthe unfolding events in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.   Since the crisis began, the White House says, Mr. Bush hastalked personally no fewer than 20 times with the leaders ofat least a dozen nations, from Italy to Yemen. In the 24hours between Monday night and last night alone, aides say,he spoke on the telephone not only with Mr. Mulroney but alsowith King Hassan of Morocco, Yemen's President Ali AbdallahSalih, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand.   Mr. Bush also has seized some unexpected opportunities tobuild international backing. By chance, British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher was in the U.S. when the Iraqiinvasion occurred; Mr. Bush, who had already met with her inAspen, Colo., during her trip, invited her to stop at theWhite House on the way home. There, she met with Mr. Bush andwith Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the North AtlanticTreaty Organization, and issued a strong statement of supportfor the president.   Similarly, Mr. Bush turned a planned trip to South Americaby Vice President Dan Quayle into an opportunity to lobby forsupport in the Persian Gulf. In preparation for Mr. Quayle'strip to Bogota for the inauguration of the new president ofColombia, the president and vice president met for lunchMonday and discussed specific messages for Mr. Quayle tocarry to other heads of state. Brazil, for instance, has beena supplier of arms to Iraq and a customer of Iraqi oil;Venezuela is being called upon to increase its oil output tohelp offset the embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies.   David Silverstein, a defense-policy analyst with theconservative Heritage Foundation, says the president's styleof personal diplomacy is all the more important now becauseof changes in the world order that have taken place. &quot;This isa post-Cold War world and the U.S., while it is a benevolentleader, is a leader in a world of equal nations,&quot; he says.   Mr. Silverstein believes &quot;a convergence of self-interests&quot;is mostly behind the world's surprisingly unified response tothe Iraqi crisis. But, he says, President Bush's personaldiplomacy &quot;has made it easier for all sides to cometogether.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
