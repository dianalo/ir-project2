The 17 Democrats on the committee's special Defense Policy Panelconcluded in a report released Friday that the Soviet conventionalthreat to the United States and its Western allies is ``greatlydiminished and cannot be revived.''   Based on that assessment, reductions in defense spending are inorder, they said.   ``Old assumptions about the Soviet threat don't jibe withreality anymore,'' Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said.``Many of the changes are irreversible, and that means we can cutselectively without jeopardizing our security.''   But the 15 Republicans on the panel rejected that view as overlyoptimistic.   ``Endorsing this report is tantamount to believing that theSoviet Union is already militarily impotent and not a global powerto be reckoned with. Such a view is more wishful thinking than areflection of reality,'' said Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama,ranking Republican on the committee.   The GOP members, in a dissent included in the 310-page report,cited the absence of a U.S.-Soviet treaty to scale backconventional forces in Europe, the unclear future of a unifiedGermany and the economic and political instability in EasternEurope.   The report cited the testimony of CIA Director William Webster,who told the Armed Services Committee on March 1 that the lesseningSoviet conventional threat would ``be increasingly difficult toreverse.''   Planned withdrawal of Soviet troops from Europe, as announced byPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December 1988, will continue aslong as the Kremlin leader remains in power, the report said.   Even if Gorbachev is replaced, his successor would be forced tofollow the same policies, it said, quoting a U.S. intelligenceassessment.   ``In short, there has been too much change in the Soviet Unionand Eastern Europe for the reduction in the threat to bereversed,'' the report said.   The Republicans said the House-approved budget that calls for$296 billion in defense spending for the 1991 fiscal year,beginning Oct. 1, would carve too much out of the U.S. military.   President Bush has proposed spending $303 billion on defense infiscal 1991.   ``We believe that the House defense spending figure, which inpercentage terms cuts defense spending three times more than thepresident's budget does, is imprudent,'' the GOP members said.</TEXT></DOC>
