Its structure makes a departure in philosophy from many otherof Sandia's older particle simulation codes. Previously, many of oursimulation codes were designed to run in batch mode, with a `fire andforget' philosophy. BUCKSHOT, on the other hand, is not a single program.It consists of an interactive main program and a menu of interactivepost-processors that read from the main program's data base. This makesit possible to generate endless combinations of output on many differentdevices, including movies from a single run. Wasted resources that areassociated with unwanted output are avoided. 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
