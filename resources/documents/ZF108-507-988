Otano, RJO-API executive vice president, said about 90 percent ofthe system's software is proprietary and was developed by the company.andO;Saville said DARS-II users include the White House, the Federal Reserve Boad,the International Trade Commission and several intelligence agencies.andM;Gary Grace, the company's director of corporate communications, saidconfigurations in each case ae tailored to user needs but all are built onthe same basic hardware platform.andM;Tompkins said RJO-API is also supplying dual-page monitors to be used intandem with 43 microcomputers RCAS officials will buy through the Desktop IIIcontract with Unisys Corp.andP;  Those systems will be linked on a 3Com Corp.andO;network.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
