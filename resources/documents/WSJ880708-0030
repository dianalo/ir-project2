The preliminary injunction denied by Judge David Edelstein also would have prevented board members from associating directly or indirectly with Mafia figures as well as barred the participation in union affairs of Mafia defendants in the government's civil suit.    However, the judge did indefinitely extend a temporary restraining order, set to expire today, that bars Teamsters officials from destroying records and from conducting any extraordinary financial transactions. The temporary order also restrains a number of alleged Mafia defendants from influencing the affairs of the union.    John Climaco, an attorney for the Teamsters, said he was &quot;gratified that Judge Edelstein has provided us with the opportunity for a meaningful defense.&quot;    Last week, the government sued the Teamsters using a civil application of the federal racketeering statutes, with the intention of eventually appointing a trustee to oversee union reforms.    Judge Edelstein, who has set a trial for next February on the government's suit, said he denied the preliminary injunction because of the complex nature of the case, and ruled that a hearing on the injunction should be consolidated with the trial.    &quot;This case is, to say the least, unique; if not in substance, then in scope,&quot; the judge said in his opinion. &quot;It is apparent from the voluminous submissions by the government and the defendants' argument that this case requires determination of important issues of fact and law. It would clearly be imprudent to grant the preliminary relief sought by the government without an evidentiary hearing.&quot;    But U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is leading the effort to reform the nation's largest union, insisted that the ruling is &quot;a helpful opinion, achieving almost everything we wanted to get.&quot;    Though the government didn't get the liaison officer it requested, Mr. Giuliani said the &quot;expeditious trial schedule,&quot; set by Judge Edelstein lessens the need for the temporary officer. &quot;Given the realities of scheduling in federal court, this is certainly as soon as possible,&quot; he said.    Earlier this week, lawyers for Teamsters defendants argued in a hearing that the court-appointed officer was unjust because neither the union nor any other defendant had been proven guilty of allegations in the government's suit. The lawyers asked for time to rebut what one called the &quot;shameful&quot; allegations. One said, if given time, he would prove that &quot;the Teamsters is not controlled, influenced or infiltrated by La Cosa Nostra.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
