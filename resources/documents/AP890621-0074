Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri of Laguna Niguel, Calif., who had beendescribed as a model soldier, could receive a life sentence.   Peri, 21, initially pleaded innocent to the espionage charges. Hechanged his plea today when his court martial began, said Maj.Samuel Taylor, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's 5th Corps.   Taylor said Peri also pleaded guilty to violating regulationsbanning travel by U.S. military close to the East German borderarea; being absent without leave; and failing to obey regulationsrequiring him to obtain permission to travel to East Germany.   Taylor said prosecutors dropped a charge of removing classifiedinformation because Peri pleaded guilty to espionage.   On Feb. 21, Peri disappeared from his unit in Fulda, near theEast German border, taking a portable computer from the office wherehe worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist.   He turned himself in 11 days later.   On March 16, the Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt said Peri had beenindicted for espionage for allegedly giving East Germany secret NATOplans for protecting West Germany in the event of an attack.   It said the East Germans notified U.S. officials that Peri madecontact with them.   Peri is assigned to the U.S. Army's 11th Cavalry Regiment inFulda, about 60 miles northeast of Frankfurt. The unit isresponsible for front-line patrols along West Germany's border withEast Germany.   Peri had been kept in investigative custody at the U.S. Army'sconfinement facility in Mannheim before the court-martial started.   Peri, neatly dressed in a U.S. Army uniform, walked with his headbowed into the U.S. Army Community Center building. The youngsoldier was not handcuffed but was escorted by military police.   The judge, Col. Craig C. Jacobson, ordered the public out of thecourtroom while specifics of the secret information Peri allegedlygave to the East Germans were discussed by the court.   Taylor said a board of military officers would be selectedThursday to hear testimony that will help determine the length ofPeri's sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
