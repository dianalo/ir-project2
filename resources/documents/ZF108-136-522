Office of Federal Procurement PolicyConsultants.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OFPP Letter Spells Out Conflict of InterestandM;The Office of Federal Procurement Policy has issued Policy Letter 89-1dealing with &quot;Conflict of Interest Policies Applicable to Consultants.&quot;andP;  Thisis another attempt to deal with an issue that was discussed constantly duringthe &quot;Ill Wind&quot; investigations of procurement fraud.andM;The OFPP policy letter defines services as including those provided byindividual experts and consultants; management and professional supportservices; the conduct and preparation of studies, analyses and evaluations;and engineering and technical services.andM;As for exclusions, besides those in Office of Management and Budget CircularA-120, the following services are not covered by the policy letter: routineengineering and technical services (such as installation, operation ormaintenance of systems, equipment, software, components or facilities);routine legal, actuarial, auditing and accounting services; and trainingservices.andM;The policy letter defines &quot;conflict of interest&quot; as a condition orcircumstance wherein a person is unable or is potentially unable to renderimpartial assistance or advice to the government because of other activitiesor relationships with other persons, or wherein a person is given an unfaircompetitive advantage.andM;Types of potential conflicts include, but are not limited to, the following:andM;* Evaluating a contractor's or potential contractor's products or services,where the evaluator is or was substantially involved in the development ormarketing of those products or services.andM;* Serving as a consultant to a contractor seeking a contract (or seeking tobe awarded the contract directly) after preparing or assisting substantiallyin the preparation of specifications, or other significant contractprovisions or requirements, to be used in the same acquisition.andM;* Serving as a consultant to a contractor seeking the award of a contract (orseeking to be awarded the contract directly) after having access to sourceselection or proprietary information not available to other people competingfor the contract.andM;* Providing advice and assistance to an agency where such advice andassistance could benefit the contractor's other clients.andM;An &quot;unfair competitive advantage&quot; exists where, in addition to the situationsaddressed in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5, a person competingfor award of a contract possesses proprietary information [defined in FAR3.104-4(j)] about a competitor or potential competitor relevant to theinstant contract, or possesses source selection information [defined in FAR3.103-4(k)] relevant to the contract but not available to all contractors.andM;&quot;Marketing consultant&quot; means an independent contractor who furnishes advice,information, direction or assistance to any other contractor in support ofthe preparation or submission of a bid or proposal for a government contract.andM;Certificates RequiredandM;An individual or company that employs, retains or engages marketingconsultants in connection with a federal acquisition must submit to thecontracting officer certificates if the individual or company is notifiedthat it is the apparent successful offerer for a contract exceeding $200,000.andM;If a certificate cannot be supplied, the successful offerer must provide awritten explanation.andP;  The contracting officer must be satisfied with thereasons given for not supplying a certificate.andM;The consultant must sign the certificate.andP;  In it, the consultant andcontractor certify that the consultant has been told of the existence of theregulations implementing the OFPP policy letter.andP;  The consultant certifiesthat he has made inquiry, and has provided no unfair competitive advantage tothe prime contractor for the services rendered in connection with thesolicitation, or that any unfair competitive advantage has been communicatedto the prime contractor.andM;Each agency must maintain the certificates described by this policy letter inthe contract file.andP;  Agencies may extract and categorize such information andconsolidate it in a central registry, as long as they treat it asconfidential, sensitive, privileged, proprietary or otherwise not releasableif requested by the submitter.andM;Certificates must be made available to department or agency contractingofficers, their supervisors and other authorized individuals such asinspectors general.andM;Determining ConflictandM;Before a contract is awarded, agency officials must determine whether aconflict of interest exists with regard to those providing advisory andassistance services to the government, or whether an unfair competitiveadvantage exists with respect to services provided by a marketing consultantin connection with a particular contract action.andM;In performing this function, they may use information from any certificatesor statements previously submitted with the offer and any other substantiveinformation available to them.andP;  The contracting officer shall award thecontract to the apparent successful offerer unless a conflict of interest orunfair competitive advantage is believed to exist that cannot be avoided ormitigated.andM;Before the contracting officer decides not to award a contract based onconflict-of-interest considerations, he or she shall notify the primecontractor, or the contractor rendering advisory and assistance services, andprovide a reasonable opportunity to respond.andM;Where the contracting officer finds that it is in the best interest of theUnited States to award the contract notwithstanding such conflict or unfaircompetitive advantage, the contract file should be documented to reflect thebasis for that finding.andM;To obtain a copy of the policy letter, contact Richard A. Ong of OFPP, tel.andO;202-395-6810.andM;Based on my review of the information made available during the Ill Windinvestigation, I am convinced that certain individuals have violated clearand unambiguous provisions of the U.S.andP;  Criminal Code.andP;  If people are willingto break the law, I do not believe that this policy letter will have mucheffect on their actions.andM;William N. Hunter, Ph.D., is a 10-year veteran of the Office of Managementand Budget, where he was director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.andP;  Heis founder of W N Hunter andamp; Associates, a Vienna, Va., management consultingfirm specializing in federal procurement policy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
