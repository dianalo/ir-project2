Instead, the bloc has moved increasingly into politics, he said.For example, President George Bush and other key Western leadersasked the community a few weeks ago to take charge of puttingtogether an economic assistance program for Poland and Hungary, hesaid.   Niles, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Canada,attributed part of the change to the community's campaign to form asingle market in late 1992. By that date, the nations want toremove trade barriers that prevent free movement of people, goods,services and money.   ``Inevitably, the 1992 program is going to result in asubstantial accretion of power and authority and responsibility inBrussels,'' Niles said in an interview.   The community's executive body, the European Commission, has itsheadquarters in Brussels.   Niles said there has been a ``quickening and deepening'' ofhigh-level contacts between the United States and the EuropeanCommission. He noted the commission's president, Jacques Delors,has met three times with Bush in recent months.   ``We also see a strong will and readiness on the part of bothpartners when we have disputes or problems to find solutions,'' hesaid.   Some worry that the European community will set up barriersdenying access to its 320 million consumers to outsiders, but Nilessaid the community should be beneficial to U.S. companies.   But he said the United States is keeping a close eye onproposals to shape the new market.   ``When we see things ... that either we don't understand or wesee as harmful to U.S. interests, we feel we have a right to raiseit with our friends,'' he said.   The United States has ``strong misgivings about quotas'' thathave been recommended for television programming in 1992, he said.   The proposal would require that most entertainment programsshown on European TV be made in Europe. U.S. officials say theAmerican industry's earnings in Europe would be hurt badly.   On other issues, Niles said both sides continue to discusspossible solutions to a stubborn dispute over a European ban on theimport of beef from U.S. cattle treated with growth hormones. TheUnited States has refused to comply with the prohibition and hasslapped retaliatory duties on imports of certain goods from theCommon Market.</TEXT></DOC>
