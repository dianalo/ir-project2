Her husband &quot;sent me one affidavit for a divorce and another saying he wanted me to carry his baby for nine months,&quot; says Mrs. Reynolds, who was about seven weeks pregnant at the time. &quot;It didn't make much sense.&quot;    A Utah state district court judge issued a temporary restraining order barring an abortion but lifted it a few days later, after a hearing on the issue. Mrs. Reynolds had the abortion shortly thereafter; her divorce case is pending.    Mrs. Reynolds is one of at least 11 women around the country who in the past six months have been sued by their mates in efforts to stop their abortions. While some of the men have won temporary injunctions, they have consistently lost their cases on appeal.    Now the question has been put to the U.S. Supreme Court. Last week, Erin Andrew Conn of Elkhart, Ind., asked the high court to examine whether he had any right to force his estranged wife to carry their baby to term. Mr. Conn, a 24-year-old Army Reserve second lieutenant who works in a toy store, lost an earlier battle last month when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that he had no right to veto his wife's abortion because it &quot;concerns only her.&quot; Jennifer Ann Conn, who is 19, had an abortion shortly after the ruling.    &quot;I was willing to take full responsibility and raise it and take care of it; there's nothing for me to do now but let the wounds heal,&quot; says Mr. Conn, explaining that he is continuing the court fight in order to seek a precedent. &quot;Maybe the next guy will have it easier.&quot;    While father's-rights lawsuits have been filed sporadically for years, the current trend has been spurred by a concerted effort on the part of anti-abortion interests, which regard the cases as a central battleground in their well-organized and multifaceted campaign. James Bopp Jr., the Terre Haute, Ind., lawyer who filed the high-court petition on behalf of Mr. Conn, has volunteered help in filing similar cases. He recently drafted and distributed to interested parties a &quot;Father's Rights Litigation Kit&quot; that includes fill-in-the-blanks model pleadings.    Fathers' rights to privacy, as well as to procreate and to enjoy the custody and companionship of their children, come into play in such cases, asserts Mr. Bopp, who is also general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion group. &quot;The right to an abortion is not an absolute one, and the courts have never said that it is,&quot; he notes. &quot;We're asking the court to find that there should be a balancing of the interests of the father against those of the mother on a case-by-case basis.&quot;    The anti-abortion interests believe that, regardless of the outcome, the bid to be heard by the Supreme Court can only strengthen their hand. &quot;If we win, we will save some babies' lives,&quot; says David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee. &quot;Even if the case goes against us, it will intensify the political and public pressure to alter Roe vs. Wade,&quot; he adds, referring to the landmark 1973 ruling that constitutional privacy rights extend to abortion.    With the Supreme Court tilting to the right, abortion-rights advocates are less than eager to see the issue trotted before it, for fear of losing ground. Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia are recent additions to the high court and haven't yet ruled there on an abortion case involving privacy rights.    Pro-choice advocates, who contend it is nothing short of involuntary servitude to order a woman to carry a child she doesn't want, argue that the issue of fathers' consent was resolved long ago by various Supreme Court rulings, especially the 1976 case of Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down a Missouri state law giving husbands an absolute veto over a wife's abortion decisions.    &quot;We feel that the Supreme Court has already addressed this issue,&quot; says Dawn Johnsen, who until last week was staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project.    However, anti-abortion groups see a difference in the current cases: They say they are seeking merely the balancing of interests referred to by Mr. Bopp, not an absolute veto right. &quot;We want to know if there are certain circumstances under which some fathers can protect their rights regarding their unborn child,&quot; says Mr. O'Steen.    It is unclear whether the high court will choose to hear Mr. Conn's case. Justice John Paul Stevens and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in separate moves, refused requests by Mr. Conn to stay the Indiana Supreme Court's order dissolving the injunction against his wife. Michael Gradison, executive director of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, believes their refusal &quot;indicates that this court at this juncture isn't willing to look at Roe vs. Wade, and that's reassuring.&quot;    Ms. Johnsen, who left the ACLU to work for the National Abortion Rights Action League, says father's-rights cases make abortion decisions all the more traumatic. &quot;It's extremely upsetting and makes women feel they are doing something wrong,&quot; she says, &quot;even though constitutionally they clearly have the right.&quot;    Testimony revealing intimate details of the Conns' sexual habits, along with other pressures of the case, prompted Mrs. Conn to leave town, giving her husband custody of their child without a fight, according to her attorney, Richard Waples of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union. &quot;She was truly emotionally devastated,&quot; he says. (Mrs. Conn couldn't be reached for comment.)    Pro-choice advocates say that the delays created by court proceedings -- 36 days in the Conn case -- unfairly increase the risks associated with abortion. With the end of her first trimester approaching rapidly, a Terre Haute woman defied a restraining order issued by Indiana's Vigo Circuit Court and had an abortion. &quot;Time was running out,&quot; says the woman, who was unnamed in court papers. &quot;I felt like I had to take my rights in my own hands and do what was right for me.&quot; The court imposed no sanctions against her, and the case remains on appeal.    Some men, in fact, concede that they file the suits to buy time. &quot;I guess I thought the more time that passed, the chances were greater that she wouldn't go through with it,&quot; says Timothy Roy Anderson, a Hermantown, Minn., maintenance worker who obtained a temporary injunction in July from a Minnesota state district court to halt his wife's abortion.    The injunction was soon lifted by the court, which noted that &quot;the Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that a pregnant woman, without the permission or consent or advice from anyone else, may undergo an abortion if she chooses to do so.&quot; Christine Marie Anderson proceeded with her abortion. While the ordeal temporarily split the couple, they have since reconciled.    Mrs. Anderson, a 27-year-old mother of three who works for the same book publisher as her husband, says the publicity was particularly trying: &quot;I'm still waiting for it to settle down. At first, it was hard just to go to the store to buy milk.&quot;    Mr. Anderson says he knew it would be a traumatic experience to face his spouse in court. &quot;I was reluctant to do it, but I wanted the chance to have another son,&quot; he says, adding that he wonders about the effect it may have on their relationship in the future. &quot;What I'm worried about is how am I going to feel and how is she going to feel. It might change two years from now or 10 years from now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
