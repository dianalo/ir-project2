RUN  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The new trains are part of a gradual increase planned for reverse commuterservice -- service from San Francisco south in the morning and San Jose northin the evening -- which currently accounts for only about 30 percent of allservice.;    Gray said the end of the Persian Gulf war and an accompanyingfall in diesel gas prices helped the agency avoid cuts threatened last month.;   The two new trains were made possible by $400,000 in state money, drawnfrom an earthquake emergency fund set up more than a year ago, after the LomaPrieta earthquake. The money was given to CalTrain in an effort to compensatefor persisting freeway closings in San Francisco, Gray said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DEBORAH ANDERLUH, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910328  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  212  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 28, 199100088050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
