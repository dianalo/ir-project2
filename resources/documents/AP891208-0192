ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The administration's goal of eliminatingworldwide agricultural subsidies is ``an utopian vision'' thatcan't be achieved soon, President Bush said Friday night.   The president's comments came in a radio interview in the heartof the Corn Belt during a brief campaign stop on behalf of Rep. TomTauke, the Iowa Republican who is attempting to unseat DemocraticSen. Tom Harkin in 1990.   A policy seeking to remove barriers to sales of U.S. farmproducts abroad, set by the Reagan administration and continued byBush, seeks the elimination of all trade-distorting practices suchas quotas and export subsidies.   ``It's a good thing to have. But I don't see that happening allat once,'' Bush said in an interview at WHO, a station where Reaganonce was a sportscaster.   Critics have said free trade in farm products would eliminatesafety nets that ensure farming will remain profitable enough toassure a stable and safe food supply and would open the possibilityof a flood of foreign meats and grains into U.S. markets.   Others have argued that practices such as import-limiting quotasraise prices to consumers, and that export subsidies, such as thosethe United States and European countries employ on a variety ofproducts, stifle farm development in the poor countries of theThird World.   Subsidy defenders have argued that the United States cannot dowithout them as long as competitors use them.   ``I still believe an Iowa farmer can compete with anybody in theworld, provided they don't tie one hand behind his back and thentell him to fight,'' Bush said at one point.   The president's trade representative, Carla Hills, has sought tomake similar points, saying this summer, for instance, U.S.negotiators in the farm trade talks of the General Agreement onTarriffs and Trade would not ``unilaterally disarm'' Americanproducers by giving up the questioned practices without gettingsomething in return.   Two Democratic members of Congress later said on the samestation they were pleased to hear that the president does notexpect all trade barriers to fall at once.   Harkin said he underlined his notes when Bush called theelimination of government subsidies ``utopian.''   ``Boy am I glad to hear him say that,'' Harkin said.   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said by telephone, ``The way theworld is set up, we'll probably never reach the utopian view thatall nations will lower their subsidies.''   Questioned by Bob Quinn, the station's news and farm informationdirector, about prospects for expanding markets for U.S.commodities in Eastern Europe, Bush said those countries first needto reform their economies before they will be in any shape toincrease purchases from the West.   While he said that, too, would take time, ``I don't see anythingother than continued increased exports for American agriculturalproducts for a long time.''   Bush said while the questions focused on Eastern Europe, ``Istill want to see us make progress in terms of knocking down thebarriers with western Europe, and we're trying.''   The Soviet Union already is a large purchaser of U.S. grains,using export subsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
