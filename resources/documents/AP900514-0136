The vote focused on free-speech rights more than abortion andcrossed ideological lines.   The court rejected an emergency request by five members ofOperation Rescue who said the injunction is violating theirfree-speech rights.   In Atlanta, Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt calledMonday's action ``a little stumble along the way,'' adding, ``Wefeel we'll be victorious in the long run.''   Lynne Randall, who operates a clinic that has been a frequenttarget of the protests, welcomed the action. ``We have to balancewomen's right to privacy with people's right to protest,'' she said.   The controversy is still alive in the Georgia courts, butMonday's action means Operation Rescue protesters for now cannot gowithin 50 feet of the property line of any Atlanta facility whereabortions are performed.   In other matters, the court:   _Heard a spirited debate over flag burning, an issue with bigpolitical stakes and clashing views over patriotism and freedom ofexpression.   The court must decide by July whether a federal law protecting``Old Glory'' from desecration is constitutional.   _Killed a lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield Co. by independentgasoline dealers in California and Washington state. The court, bya 7-2 vote, said price-cutting schemes that hurt a competitor'sbusiness do not necessarily violate federal antitrust laws.   _Voted 6-3 to squelch a lawsuit that charged the UnitedSteelworkers union with negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver minedisaster that killed 91 miners. The court said such state courtaction is pre-empted by federal labor law.   _Refused to referee an attack by 30 states against 26manufacturers over the removal of asbestos from public schools andother government buildings.   The court's vote in the Operation Rescue case from Atlantayielded strange judicial bedfellows.   Voting to lift the March 29 injunction were the court's two mostconsistent liberals, Justices William J. Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall, and two of its most conservative members, JusticesAnthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.   Brennan and Marshall are strong supporters of abortion rights,but also are strong supporters of free-speech rights. Kennedy andScalia oppose broad abortion rights but have more moderate trackrecords on free-speech issues.   Writing for the four, Kennedy cited the court's 1977 decisionthat refused to block Nazis from marching in the heavily Jewishcommunity of Skokie, Ill.   Kennedy said the 1977 ruling ``does not distinguish amongspeakers based on the content of their speech.''   But Justice John Paul Stevens, who cast a decisive vote to leaveintact the Atlanta injunction, said the court was not drawing anycontent-of-speech distinctions.   Stevens noted that in 1977 the American Nazi Party ``did nothave a similar history of illegal conduct in the jurisdiction wherethe march was scheduled,'' and he called Operation Rescue members``a class of persons who have persistently and repeatedly engagedin unlawful conduct.''   Also voting to leave the injunction intact were Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmunand Sandra Day O'Connor.   Stevens and Blackmun are strong supporters of abortion rights.Rehnquist, White and O'Connor are not.   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the National DemocraticConvention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators atOperation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricadedabortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering orleaving.   Operation Rescue members Michael Hirsch, Gina Robertson, WilliamHaynes, Steve Britt and Pamela Sekulow said the Atlanta injunctiondeters them ``from engaging in prayer, picketing, leafleting andother forms of peaceful expression on public forum streets andsidewalks.''   The state judge who issued the injunction is considering arequest to modify it, and a formal challenge to the injunction isbefore the Georgia Supreme Court.   Similar legal challenges to Operation Rescue demonstrations atabortion clinics in other states have left the organization in deepdebt.   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who spent time in jailuntil a contempt-of-court fine for violating a similar injunctionin New York was paid, called Monday's action ``an outrage.''   ``Our rights are being denied because we're pro-life Christians.If we were homosexuals, does anyone really think that we would bedenied access to a public sidewalk,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
