Try: the house that bacon built.</LP><TEXT>   Today is the Merc's 30th anniversary of trading in what itcalls &quot;the quintessential commodity,&quot; pork bellies.Understandably, the exchange is feeling festive.   It's celebrating the occasion with a two-day party.Yesterday, Merc executives disrupted floor trading byparading a slab of meat into the pork-belly pit and posingwith it for photographers. The Merc has even revived alittle-known ditty called &quot;Pork Belly Blues,&quot; penned bytrader Mark Hankins. A few lyrics:                                                                                                          Don't get me wrong now, I love trading swine,   There's nothing more dear to this hog heart of mine,   But it isn't hog heaven and I deeply regret   There are days I would rather forget   In the pork-belly pit.                                                                                                          NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show caught the fever, dispatching areporter to Chicago to ask passersby: &quot;Do you know what apork belly is?&quot; (The answer: uncured bacon.) Each hog has twobellies. On their way to the breakfast table, they are cutfrom beneath the rib cage, stripped of tough rind, pumpedfull of brine, smoked, sliced, packaged and shipped togrocery stores.   The anniversary is a time for veteran traders to waxsentimental and swap pork-belly yarns about:   -- The BLT factor. A mystifying annual consumer cravingfor bacon-lettuce-tomato sandwiches in late summer creates asurge in bacon demand that has produced some of the biggestbull markets the pork-belly pit has ever known.   -- Hollywood. The producers of &quot;Trading Places&quot; had wantedto film in the Merc's pork-belly pit. Sensing apublic-relations disaster, the exchange turned them down. So,in the movie, Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy trade orange juiceinstead. (Merc executives are glad they refused. The filmdepicts commodities markets as a latter-day Babylon, whereunethical money-changers betray loyal employees and stealgovernment crop reports.)   The hoopla seems justified. If not for pork-bellies, mosttraders agree, the Merc wouldn't have become today's $10billion-a-year global financial center. You might say and,all too often, oldtimers do: pork bellies saved the Merc'sbacon.</TEXT></DOC>
