Gastric hydrolysis of lactoferrin at pH 3.2 inthe weanling was 20-fold greater than that in the suckling. In the smallintestine at neutral pH, luminal degradation of lactoferrin was minimalin the suckling but increased significantly after weaning, with maximaldegradative capacity demonstrable in the midjejunum. Sephadex G-75 chromatographyof intestinal acid-soluble breakdown products revealed two peaks of radioactivity,each comprising 40-45% of the total product; analysis of intestinal acid-precipitableproducts by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded several discretelower molecular weight species. Food deprivation for 12 h/100 g bodywt decreased lactoferrin degradation in the weanling jejunum and midjejunum.The findings suggest that lactoferrin digestion may vary with respectto postnatal age of the organism, segment of the gastrointestinal tract,and dietary state. In the young animal, lactoferrin degradation is minimal,and consequently its potential for biological function may be high.</TEXT></DOC>
