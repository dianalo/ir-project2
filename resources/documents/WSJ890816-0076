Segall, formerly senior vice president of corporate strategy and development at American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., to the new position of vice chairman.    In his new role, which becomes effective Sept. 1, Mr. Segall will be responsible for identifying new strategies and business opportunities for the Atlanta-based telecommunications concern. He will report directly to the board and will serve as a member of Contel's executive committee. His appointment increases board membership to 16.    A Bell System veteran of more than three decades, Mr. Segall was an architect of ATandamp;T's post-divestiture strategy and was instrumental in establishing the company's international business links with Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co.    Contel's decision may indicate that the company will concentrate more effort on diversifying and expanding overseas.    &quot;It is no coincidence that we have chosen someone with a deep understanding of our heritage in the telephone business for the position of vice chairman,&quot; said Donald Weber, Contel's president and chief executive officer. &quot;But, his real strength is that he has the experience to help us reach beyond our traditional markets and to use our reputation for customer service and technical excellence as building blocks for establishing new ventures both domestically and internationally.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
