Atthe same time, the Communist-controlled Parliament amendedthe constitution so as to eliminate the words &quot;socialist&quot; and&quot;communist&quot; from the text and elected Petr Mladenov, theCommunist leader who precipitated these reforms, to the newposition of president of the republic.   But Bulgaria's success in reaching democracy depends noton the goodwill of the old regime, but on the profusion ofdemocratic forces that have sprung up since Todor Zhivkov,the man who ruled Bulgaria since 1954, was deposed on Nov.10. Many of these forces can be found in a five-storybuilding on Sofia's Knyaz Dondukov Boulevard, where scores ofyoung Bulgarians briskly move from office to office. On onefloor is the near-libertarian Radical Democratic Party; onanother is the Social Democratic Party and its more militantnon-Marxist fraction.</LP><TEXT>   About a mile away, on Rakovsky street, in the former homeof the Bulgarian Industrial Society, is the office of theUnited Democratic Front -- an umbrella group that has uniteda broad coalition of democratic political parties,environmental groups, student groups and free trade unions.The Democratic Front's chairman, Zhelyu Zhelev, isunabashedly optimistic about the prospects for democracy: &quot;Ifwe hold together a broad coalition of all democratic forces,we can change everything in Bulgaria within a few months oftaking power. By the end of the year, we will resolve all thepolitical and economic transformations necessary fordemocracy.&quot;   The Front promises to restore private ownership excludingonly mineral resources, water, forests and pastures. Sharesin most state enterprises would be given to privately heldpension, insurance and health funds. Those bits of the statesector that the Front does not intend to dispose of would betransferred from the national government to themunicipalities. The minimum wage and unemployment insurancewould be retained; otherwise, the Front intends to plungeinto the market.   One of the country's most powerful democratic leaders isKonstantin Trenchev, who heads Bulgaria's independent tradeunion federation, Podkrepa (Support). Only last summer, Mr.Trenchev was in jail. Today, with his movement grown to150,000 members, Mr. Trenchev senses victory. &quot;By the timeelections come in June, Podkrepa can have as many as 500,000members. I am confident that we will win.&quot;   On the streets of Sofia, Mr. Trenchev is stopped every fewminutes by wellwishers, by those seeking help or by unioncolleagues. In restaurants, his arrival turns heads. Hissharp interventions at televised roundtable discussions withthe authorities have made a celebrity of him.   Mr. Trenchev is a strong admirer of the free market. &quot;Whenwe take power in June we must move decisively to dismantleall the structures of totalitarianism. We have to make a dashfor the market, which is the normal state of economy. We mustmove from a pathological system to a normal one. And thesocial tension in the country is already enormous. I'm forthe Balcerowicz Plan,&quot; he says, referring to the program ofcurrency convertibility and subsidy elimination adopted byPolish finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.   Until the elections, the old authorities are still incharge. Mr. Zhelev worries that outside Sofia and other majorurban centers, the opposition program is still not wellknown. Party bosses still rule like lords over the smallpeasant communities in the provinces. Above all, the partyretains control of the media: television through the statemonopoly, and the press through its control of newsprintallocations. While the party's papers together print 3million copies a day, the UDF paper, Democratsiya, had beenpermitted to print only 70,000. After a March 12 rally formore newsprint drew 150,000 protesters, the UDF was permitted300,000 copies.   Nevertheless, the communists' commitment to reform mightlook more sincere if each successive act of liberalizationwere not so obviously stamped &quot;Made in the U.S.S.R.&quot; &quot;IfMoscow passes land reform legislation or joint-venture laws,Bulgaria passes similar legislation within a matter of days,&quot;a diplomat here observed.   Still, the secret police are not much in evidence and theordinary police now lackadaisically enforce the decrees thatrestrict demonstrations, public meetings and streetmerchants. The traffic police in their imposing watch towersblithely pass the day reading newspapers where they onceflagged down drivers and pedestrians for the leastinfraction.   The government's lingering attachment to central economiccontrols is the opposition's ultimate weapon. Newsprint isnot the only item in short supply. Industrial output declinedby over 10% in the three months after the toppling of Mr.Zhivkov. Price controls restrain nominal inflation to around10%, but more and more basic foodstuffs -- sometimes milk andat other times even bread -- are vanishing from shops forweeks on end. Under these circumstances, the population islikely to vote for change as soon as it gets the chance.   With some justice, it was the communists' campaign ofrepression against the country's Turkish minority thatprecipitated the economic crisis. Persecution persuaded morethan 300,000 Turks, most of them farmers, to flee Bulgarialast year. Their fields were left unplanted and soil untilled-- and the result was, soon enough, the food shortage fromwhich Bulgaria now suffers. This crisis provoked a wave ofindustrial unrest, which in turn persuaded the authorities torelax their control of daily life.   The opposition is eager for Western assistance: Electionobservers to help ensure a fair count or a visit by aprominent U.S. political figure -- such as Sen. EdwardKennedy, or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan. An entertainersuch as Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson or Joan Baez might beeven better.   But the opposition, which is indignant over thesquandering of billions of dollars in Western loans by theZhivkov regime, also seems to agree that economic assistanceshould come only after the democratic process has becomeirreversible.   ---   Mr. Karatnycky is director of research at the AFL-CIOdepartment of international affairs.
