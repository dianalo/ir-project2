In August a year ago, the Communists gave upgoverning; two years ago, strikes forced them into unheard-ofcompromises; 10 years ago, the movement that inspired theirdownfall was born in Gdansk.   Solidarity has spent the month celebrating its birthday,and though the Rolling Stones called off their show, theHarlem Globetrotters put on theirs. The festivities endtoday, exactly a decade since Solidarity first was legalized.Lech Walesa will give a speech. By the time he finishes, itshould be clearer than ever that Solidarity, age 10, is dead.</LP><TEXT>   As a trade union in a country where trade unions don'thave much say, it will go on. As a social and politicalmovement uniting a people against Communist oppression, itswork is done.   Solidarity-the-movement has already split into two newpolitical parties, differing over the road Poland ought totake on its way to capitalism and on how fast it ought totravel. Fresh from a visit to the Vatican, Mr. Walesa maychoose to complete the break on this opportune day by sayingstraight out to an audience of luminaries what he has beensaying in code for months: that he is a candidate for thepresidency of Poland.   Even if a last-minute change of strategy keeps himpussyfooting, this country's first post-Communist politicalseason is sure to begin in September, with a presidentialelection following before long. Mr. Walesa's former ally,Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, has been trying to decidewhether to oppose him. Some Poles think the prime ministermight make up his mind today, too.   Neither Mr. Mazowiecki nor his supporters want an electionnow. The Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action, led by Mr.Walesa's former intellectual advisers, would rather let thegovernment go on calmly dismantling communism; in thateffort, Poland is well ahead of the other new boys of the oldbloc.   &quot;It's a distraction,&quot; says Jan Litynski, a founder of theCitizens' Movement. &quot;Logically, it would make sense to waitfor next spring, but they've started the campaign.&quot;   For Mr. Walesa and his backers in a nascent party calledthe Center Alliance, an election is long overdue. Despite itsdemocratic ideals and economic coherence, they argue,Poland's government is still the product of a deal madebefore the rest of the Soviet Empire collapsed in EasternEurope, and Communists still infest it.   &quot;We were first in the process of democratization and nowwe follow,&quot; says Adam Glapinski, an economist on theAlliance's political council. &quot;We don't want anything morethan people already have in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.&quot;   One hurdle, in the person of President WojciechJaruzelski, remains to be vaulted before the Alliance canhave its wish. Gen. Jaruzelski must quit. The Alliance hastoyed with the idea of mass protests to force him out. Mr.Walesa would then replace him, with parliament's approval,and run for the presidency as an incumbent.   The general doesn't seem pleased with this plan. He'dprefer to exit more gracefully, and has attracted someunlikely champions: the Citizens' Movement, the RomanCatholic Church and the U.S.   George Bush has invited Gen. Jaruzelski to Washington foran official visit on Oct. 11, well after Mr. Walesa had hopedto unseat him. And earlier this month Cardinal Jozef Glempreceived the general at Czestochowa, Poland's holiest site.Mr. Glapinski calls that &quot;some kind of blasphemy,&quot; and theAlliance is still collecting signatures on anti-Jaruzelskipetitions. But it appears to have set aside for now itsthreat of public disruptions.   Instead, it will back a constitutional amendment to choosethe president by popular, rather than parliamentary, vote.The Citizens' Movement backs it, too, and parliament willconvene in mid-September to debate it. If the amendmentpasses, Gen. Jaruzelski could resign, perhaps before year'send, to let an election take place.   Mr. Mazowiecki, the opinion polls suggest, might win it.But no one can ignore Lech Walesa's enduring power overPolish politics or the potential impact of his call for an&quot;acceleration&quot; of Poland's passage to the free market andfull democracy.   By &quot;acceleration&quot; Mr. Walesa seems to mean the removalfrom public and economic life of anyone who owes his positionto the Communists -- factory foremen to school principals.And while the Alliance has no quarrel with economicausterity, it wants a faster sell-off of state companies runby one-time apparatchiks.   &quot;Privatization is revolution,&quot; Mr. Glapinski says. &quot;Itmeans 400,000 people will lose their jobs.&quot;   Talk like that makes Mr. Walesa's old friends gulp. Heaccuses them of blocking democracy; they accuse him ofdemagoguery. &quot;It's very dangerous,&quot; says Mr. Litynski.&quot;People could be deprived of property, put into prison.&quot;   The Citizen's Movement is trying to think positively. IfMr. Mazowiecki wins the presidency, some hope Mr. Walesa willagree to be his prime minister. And if Mr. Walesa wins, hisfuture at least won't be the main issue in parliamentaryelections that should take place in the spring.   Yet by August of next year -- as things look this August-- a good part of Poland's old opposition, once united inSolidarity, could find itself in opposition again.</TEXT></DOC>
