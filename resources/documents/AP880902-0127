Soviet installations in Tartus, including submarine and surfaceship maintenance facilities, constitute the largest Soviet navalbase in the Mediterranean, said Dore Gold of Tel Aviv University'sJaffee Center for Strategic Studies.   Aharon Levran, editor of The Middle East Military Balancepublished this week by the center, said the facilities extend toArwad island and include recreation facilities for Soviet crews.   Gold said no declassified information was available on thecurrent or planned size of the Soviet base, but that the generaland continuing trend has been expansion since 1987.   He said the Soviet navy's Mediterranean Squadron is usingTartus, about 200 miles north of Tel Aviv, because it is outsideSoviet territory and has good access to the Mediterranean.   The Soviets use other land installations in Syria forintelligence-gathering, Gold and Levran said in separate interviews.   Gold said the main objective of the Tartus base expansion was tocounter the U.S. 6th Fleet presence in the Mediterranean.   The United States has bases in Spain, Italy, Greece and France.The Soviet Union had to find new arrangements after Albania shiftedits alliance to China in 1961 and Egypt dropped its friendshiptreaty with Moscow in 1976, he said.   Gold said the Tartus facility was important for prolongeddeployment of Soviet attack submarines in the Mediterranean.   The London-based Jane's Defense Weekly in May called Tartus``the primary maintenance facility for Soviet submarines operatingin the Mediterranean.''   Levran said the Soviets have been using Tartus for at least fiveyears and that the base's expansion apparently was a price Syriahad to pay for purchasing Soviet weapons.   Despite the Kremlin's recent reluctance to supply Syria withadvanced weapons systems, he said, ``Syria is still the SovietUnion's strategic asset in the Middle East.''   He said the base replaced the Soviet practice of usingMediterranean Squadron ships for maintenance. But he said the basewas less important than the recently developed Soviet Far Easternbase in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam.</TEXT></DOC>
