<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-0901 </DOCNO><TEXT>A second edition of ``Safeguards Instrumentation: A Computer-Based Catalog''was published in 1985 by the Technical Support Organization (TSO) atBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) at the request of the US Departmentof Energy, Office of Safeguards and Security (DOE/OSS), InternationalSafeguards Branch (the original sponsor). The object of the revisionwas to keep the information up-to-date, so as to assist in-field personnelin implementing effective safeguards, and DOE/OSS staff in long-rangeplanning. Orientation and format of the original edition were left basicallyunchanged. A number of entries on new developments in safeguards instrumentationwere added; many of the original entries were deleted or updated. Thenew edition provides information on 125 representative items in the ``MaterialsAccountancy'' and ``Containment and Surveillance'' categories. The documentwas generated from a database that had been developed for the originaledition and that continues to be stored in a HP-3000 computer locatedat BNL. The database can be readily accessed by TSO personnel for updatingor other modifications on a continuous basis. It may also be accessed,under certain conditions, by individuals outside BNL for informationor searches. If kept up-to-date, the database provides a useful mechanismfor keeping the safeguards community informed on developments in, andapproximate cost of, relevant instrumentation, even in the absence offurther printed editions of the ``Catalog.'' 3 refs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
