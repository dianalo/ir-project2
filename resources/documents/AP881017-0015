Quayle, he said, was up in the cockpit giving aninterview to the pilot.   ``It's the only person he hasn't talked to yet,'' the reportersaid.   When the ``new,'' accessible Dan Quayle emerged last week, thecontrast with the ``old,'' aloof Quayle seemed dramatic to thosewho had studied him since he became the Republican vicepresidential nominee.   The old Quayle was a wooden, programmed speaker who avoided themedia at every turn. The new Quayle has a conversational speakingstyle and is relentlessly available, engaging protesters andshowing up everywhere there is a camera, microphone or notepad.   Like a schoolboy given a reprieve from a final exam, Quayle nowseems relaxed, cheerful, confident and, as he put it, ``a lothappier.''   The Indiana senator's public break with the rigid control of hiscampaign by Bush handlers and declaration that ``I am my ownhandler'' raised skeptical eyebrows among his press entourage.   The change still seems one more of style than substance. Quayleis still relegated to campaigning mostly in safe Republican areasor small towns in swing states of his native Midwest. And hecontinues to echo positions already propounded by the campaign.   But after a week of scrutiny, even the most dedicated skepticswere forced to observe that Quayle did indeed seem to be a changedcandidate.   Those who have known Quayle for years say his new style typifieshim before he was lifted from relative obscurity to the intensespotlight of a national political campaign.   He is quick to challenge protesters who disrupt his speeches,telling them ``You don't know my record.'' And his speeches areoften delivered from notecards rather than prepared texts. Often,they are followed by a chatty question-and-answer session with theaudience.   With close media scrutiny and the fallout from damagingquestions about his military service, academic record and personallife _ it simply took Quayle time to decide that it was best tojust be himself, aides argue. It is a theory Quayle echoes.   ``I was just trying to feel my way through this nationalcampaign and what the ground rules were and the expectations areand how best I can serve George Bush, and it's just taken me awhile,'' he said. ``Now I know and now I'm off on my own.''   Quayle tackled his new role with relish. In fact, his enthusiasmfor his self-styled job of ``Dr. Spin'' _ the man who interpretscampaign developments for the press _ was such that a sign wasposted at the entrance of the press section of the plane reading:``Spin Free Zone.'' But Quayle came back anyway, again and again.   hose Bush strategists would be wringing their hands, Quayle toldreporters one night as he perched on a the arm of a seat in theaircraft, ``if they knew I was back here now.''   Quayle says the moment he knew he had to break away came twodays after his debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, when he learnedof the anonymous sniping from Bush staffers who viewed him as aliability to the ticket.   Angry, Quayle telephoned Bush campaign chairman James A. BakerIII. Then he went public, saying he would take more control of hiscampaign. Aides denied that the whole episode was Baker's latestploy to prop up a weak candidate.   What appeared more likely was that Baker and company had turnedQuayle's dissatisfaction into a positive development. Campaignofficials in fact seemed delighted at the media attention drawn byQuayle's metamorphosis into an ``in-charge'' candidate.   Quayle says that if the strategists ``didn't like what I wasdoing, I suppose they could find a way to try to stop me.''   ``But ... I think what is happening is that they trust myjudgment and my judgment from a political point of view is good,''he said.   Quayle denies suggestions of a rift between the two camps.   ``We're all together. We're all pulling together for GeorgeBush.''   The new strategy may be risky. Quayle's campaign to date hasbeen noteworthy for those few moments when he did strike out on hisown to depart from a prepared text and ended up committing gaffes,such as the time he told reporters, ``I didn't live in thiscentury.''   But Quayle seems philosophical about the dangers.   ``You're in a critical position no matter how you conductyourself and I made a decision on the way I'm going to conductmyself ... and it's going to be entirely different than I did thefirst weeks of the campaign,'' he said.   ``In some respects you can say that it's a higher wire thatwe're walking on, but it will help George Bush and I am convincedof that,'' he said. ``That's my judgment and I'm very comfortablewith it.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Eileen Putman is an Associated Press writercovering Dan Quayle's campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
