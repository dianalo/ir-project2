Bulk buyers of the book include a life insurance company that says it paid $2,000 for books in place of an appearance fee for the speaker; the president of a university for whom the Texas Democrat helped get federal grants; a major campaign donor who is at the center of a criminal investigation into commercial bribery in the Texas gas market; a board member of the National Education Association; and two more Washington lobbyists. Most of the names were released by Mr. Wright.    House rules forbid members from taking more than $100 in gifts from anyone with a direct interest in legislation. The transactions show that in several cases, books were sold to lobbyists and others with a stake in the work of Congress. As reported previously, the Teamsters political action committee and Washington lobbyist John White also purchased 1,000 copies each.    Mr. Wright, who is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, has denied that there was anything improper about the sales of the book or the unusually generous royalties he was paid on the book, which was printed in 1984.    He has also denied that the book was intended primarily as a money-making enterprise and said he wasn't involved in its marketing. However, Gordon MacKay, vice president for lobbying and public affairs of Boston-based New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., said that in 1985 the company bought copies of the book instead of paying Mr. Wright directly for an address to its executives. &quot;In lieu of an honorarium, we purchased $2,000 of his books,&quot; Mr. MacKay said.    House members may legally accept an honorarium, or appearance fee, of as much as $2,000 per event. But House rules limit members to accepting total honoraria of 30% of salary. In 1985 Mr. Wright accepted more than $26,000 in honoraria, very near the limit.    Mr. Wright said one bulk purchaser of his book was Boston University President John Silber, a native of Texas. Mr. Wright has helped get federal grants for the university, including $19 million in 1984 for a science and engineering center. Mr. Silber was in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment.    Another bulk purchase was arranged by the Washington representative of Louis Fritz, president of Coronado Transmission Co., a Texas pipeline company, in 1985. Mr. Fritz has given heavily to Mr. Wright's political campaigns and to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He said he paid $800 to help market the book, but personally received only a single copy.    At a federal trial in Houston last year, Richard Wilkins, a gas buyer for Lone Star Gas Co., a unit of the Dallas-based Enserch Corp., was convicted of accepting more than $519,000 in kickbacks on the purchase of gas from Coronado, through a shell company owned by Mr. Fritz. Mr. Wilkins is appealing and Mr. Fritz hasn't been charged. The prosecutor in the case said at the time, &quot;We believe there is a cesspool of corruption and bribery in the natural gas industry.&quot; Published reports said two federal grand juries were investigating, one focused exclusively on Coronado.    In a telephone interview, Mr. Fritz said he wants passage of bills before Congress to amend the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the mail fraud statute to clarify the legal status of his business practices. But he said he hadn't spoken about the legislation to Mr. Wright.    Others now known to have bought multiple copies of Mr. Wright's book include Washington lobbyist J.D. Williams, who paid $100 and said he received 16 copies of the $5.95 volume. Yesterday, Mr. Wright gave reporters a list of additional bulk buyers, including his former aide, Craig Raupe, now a Washington lobbyist for several corporations and trade associations. Mr. Raupe said he bought only 10 copies.    The speaker also said Charlene Bice, a teacher at the J.T. Stevens elementary school in Fort Worth and one of four Texas members of the NEA's national board of directors, took &quot;a considerable number&quot; of books on consignment to sell to other teachers.    In another development, the speaker's attorney, William Oldaker, said about 2,000 copies of the book were sold in 1987, earning Mr. Wright $6,500 in previously undisclosed royalties and bringing his total yield from the book to more than $61,000.    The speaker's staff had denied that he received any royalties last year from the book. Mr. Oldaker said the publisher, Carlos Moore, kept the 1987 royalty payments in escrow rather than remitting them as required by his contract with the speaker.    Mr. Wright didn't list those earnings on 1987 personal financial disclosure forms. Attorney Daniel Swillinger, said, &quot;at a minimum, he should have disclosed this (the $6,500 escrow) as an asset.&quot; Mr. Swillinger counseled Rep. Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) on the drafting of a complaint against Mr. Wright that helped touch off the ethics investigation.    Wright aides said 1987 royalties were assigned to a blind trust whose income and assets didn't have to be disclosed. But Mr. Wright's blind trust wasn't approved until Nov. 17 of last year, and rights to the book weren't included in a list he released of assets transferred into the trust.    Other buyers identified by the speaker include Rep. Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.), who he said bought about 150 books. Rep. Gordon said he bought the books with his campaign funds and gave them to campaign donors attending a Tennessee fund-raising event in August 1985 at which Rep. Wright spoke.    ---   John E.
