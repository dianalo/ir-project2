Three goals guided the research described in this report:to improve understanding of the factors that hinder or facilitate thetransfer of OBCS R and D results, to determine which technology transferstrategies are most effective and under what circumstances each is appropriate,and to document the market penetration and energy savings achieved bysuccessfully-commercialized innovations that have received OBCS support.Twelve successfully-commercialized innovations are discussed here. Themethodology employed involved a review of the literature, interviewswith innovation program managers and industry personnel, and data collectionfrom secondary sources. Six generic technology transfer strategies arealso described. Of these, contracting R and D to industrial partnersis found to be the most commonly used strategy in our case studies. Themarket penetration achieved to date by the innovations studied rangesfrom less than 1% to 100%. For the three innovations with the highestpredicted levels of energy savings (i.e., the flame retention head oilburner, low-E windows, and solid-state ballasts), combined cumulativesavings by the year 2000 are likely to approach 2 quads. To date theenergy savings for these three innovations have been about 0.2 quads.Our case studies illustrate the important role federal agencies can playin commercializing new technologies. 27 refs., 21 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
