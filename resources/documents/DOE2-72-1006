In the anomalous state of AM Her, thisnumber is only {similar_to} 15, falling on a sparsely populated accretionzone; the individual footpoints are seen in soft X-rays as protrudingsplashes and give rapid transitions from the low to high flux levelsas the accretion zone (andless;10/sup -2/ of the white dwarf surface) rotatesinto view. The high level occupies {similar_to} 50 per cent of the cycle,as observed. In the normal state, there are many more dense blobs, andthe curves become quasi-sinusoidal.</TEXT></DOC>
