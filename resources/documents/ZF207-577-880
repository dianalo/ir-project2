(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Tsai, Roger Y.; Lenz, Reimar K.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A simple but fast, accurate, flexible and autonomous technique isdeveloped for calibrating the 3D positional relationship andorientation between a robotic eye (camera) and the last joint of arobot hand.andP;  A robotic system must know the relationship betweenits hand and its base, the camera and the hand, and the targetobject and the camera in order to determine the position andorientation of the object vis-a-vis the robot hand.andP;  The newtechnique makes a planned sequence of movements, grabbing andextracting an image of the target object at each position, andperforming the calibration of the camera-hand physicalrelationship.andP;  Details of the system are described.andP;  Simulationand real-world experiments demonstrate the viability of thesystem.andP;  The technique is far more accurate and faster thanalternative methods.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     RobotsThree-Dimensional GraphicsCalibrationImage ProcessingSystem DesignRobot Arms.andO;Feature:   illustrationchartgraph.andO;Caption:   Basic setup for robot hand-eye calibration.
