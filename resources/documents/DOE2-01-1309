Vital areas are those areas whichcontain vital equipment, and therefore, must be protected against radiologicalsabotage. In general, these recommendations are more relaxed than thecurrent criteria contained in Review Guide 17 (RG-17). Before the VACrecommendations can be implemented, the NRC must perform a regulatoryanalysis. This study is a cost analysis of the RG-17 criteria and VACrecommendations to serve as one input to the regulatory analysis. Theapproach was to apportion the nuclear power industry into groups of similarplants, perform the cost analysis on selected plants from the groups,and extrapolate the results to the entire industry.</TEXT></DOC>
