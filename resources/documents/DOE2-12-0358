Fuji (3750 m) are summarized in comparison with aMonte Carlo simulation based on a plausible assumption about hadronicinteractions and primary composition. Our analysis shows that the assumptionof approximate Feynman scaling in the fragmentation region and a heavy-enrichedprimary composition in the energy range over 10/sup 15/ eV is whollycompatible with the experimental data. That is, there is no evidenceof strong violation of Feynman scaling in the fragmentation region atleast up to 10/sup 16/ eV. As to the primary cosmic rays, our data infera steepening of proton spectrum at energies around 10/sup 14/ eV. Theproton component in the primary cosmic rays is estimated to occupy 15--20% of the total flux at 10/sup 15/ eV. Some other interesting implicationson hadronic interactions are discussed with reference to the structuresof gamma families.</TEXT></DOC>
