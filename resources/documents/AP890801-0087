A U.S. Air Force transport plane flew out the first of the 96missiles at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, which are tobe destroyed at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, the AirForce said.   Britain's domestic news agency Press Association said 16missiles were flown out. The Air Force declined to give specifics.   All the missiles are due to be removed by 1991 under the termsof a superpower arms control treaty signed in 1987 to eliminate the2,700 Soviet and U.S. land-based intermediate-range nuclearmissiles from Europe.   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said the 16 missiles'nuclear warheads were flown to the United States on July 19 andcould be recycled for use.   The site became a focal point of demonstrations after thedeployment, and a permanent ``peace camp'' was set up by theCampaign for Nuclear Disarmament supporters at one of its sevenentrances.   Hundreds of thousands of anti-nuclear demonstrators protestedthe deployment of the missiles in five European countries, startingwith an airlift to Greenham Common on Nov. 14, 1983.   The other U.S. cruise missile base in Britain at Molesworth, 70miles north of London, was deactivated in January after its 16missiles were removed.</TEXT></DOC>
