Soil solution Al reacting with 8-hydroxyquinolinein 15 s, ferron in 30 s, and aluminon in 30 min were related to rootand shoot growth of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L. cv.Mt. Barket) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. cv. Cave-in-Rock) inlimed and unlimed treatments of 10 acidic subsoil horizons. Across all10 soils the amount of Al reacting with 8-hydroxyquinoline was generallythe lowest, and that reacting with ferron the highest, although overlapamong methods did occur. Manganese interference in several of the soilsolutions limited the utility of the ferron method. The amounts of Alreacting with 8-hydroxyquinoline and aluminon were significantly related(P andless; 0.05) to root and shoot growth limitations exhibited by subterraneanclover and switch-grass. Activities of Al{sup 3+} (a/sub Al{sup 3+}/)calculated from the GEOCHEM program using the Al reacting with 8-hydroxyquinolineand aluminon as the Al inputs were generally the best predictors of rootand shoot growth.</TEXT></DOC>
