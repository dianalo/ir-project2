The vote was 360 to 53.   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, represents about a 4percent cut in purchases of military weapons systems, whileincreasing military pay and money for operation and maintenance,reflecting congressional preference for maintaining readiness offighting forces over developing new technology.   Together with other money bills, the defense measure wouldprovide a total of $299.6 billion for military and intelligenceactivities in the year that begins Oct. 1, essentially a freeze ondefense spending for the fourth straight year.   For Reagan's Star Wars system, the bill would provide $3.5billion in development money, a reduction from the current year's$3.9 billion and far below the administration's request for 1989 of$4.8 billion.   It provides $410 million to support drug enforcement, includingmoney for purchase of radar aircraft, helicopters and patrol boats.   Also included was an estimated $20 billion or so to fund U.S.intelligence programs through the CIA and other agencies. The exactamount is classified.   Military personnel would get a 4 percent pay increase under thebill, which would maintain an active-duty strength of 2.1 million.The increase is part of a $78.4 billion personnel budget.   Another $80.7 billion is earmarked for buying weapons. Amongbig-ticket items are $1.4 billion for 545 M-1 Abrams tanks, $871million for 72 Apache attack helicopters, $1.9 billion for 66Trident II missiles, $1.3 billion for a Trident submarine, $2.3billion for 84 F-A-18 fighter planes, $2.1 billion for threedestroyers, $1 billion for four C-17 transport planes and $807million for a dozen MX missiles.   The bill includes $100 million for rail basing of the MXmissile, $693 million less than the administration asked, and $600million for the Midgetman missile, $400 million less than Reaganwanted. The balance between the small ICBM and the rail-based MX isexpected to be settled in a House-Senate conference on defenseauthorizing legislation.   As it considered the bill, the House adopted an amendment byRep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., requiring the Navy to report on the causesand circumstances of death for 17 recruits who died during trainingsince 1986.   Roth's amendment stems from the death of Lee Mirecki, who diedMarch 2 during Navy rescue swimmer training in Florida.   Roth said he has been unable to obtain the results of a Navyinquiry into the death.   The House also adopted an amendment by Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.,stipulating that no federal money be spent in any workplace whichis not drug-free.   At the same time, the Senate Appropriations defense subcommitteeTuesday adopted a similar $282 billion money bill and scheduled themeasure for full committee action on Friday.   That version included slightly more _ $3.7 billion _ for theStar Wars program and provided $199 million for drug interdiction.   The subcommittee approved an amendment by Sen. Daniel Inouye,D-Hawaii, giving Israel the right to bid on the same basis as NATOcountries on defense procurement contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
