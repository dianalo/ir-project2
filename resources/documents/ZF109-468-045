(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>With annual sales increasing at a rate of 200 to 250 percent, opticalscanners have become a hot item in the PC market.andP;  Their ability to read andconvert images into a form the PC can manipulate has already proved theirvalue, particularly in desktop publishing, database management, andcomputer-aided design (CAD) applications.andP;  Increasing capabilities andfalling prices are sure to widen their popularity still further.andM;Even today, with simple hand-held units available for under $100, scannertechnology is accessible to the most dollar-conscious computer user.andP;  ThisLab Notes will give you an overview of the kinds of considerations you shouldbear in mind when trying to match your needs to what's available andupcoming, and the sidebar glossary will guide you through the jargon of thisrapidly developing field.andM;The need to incorporate diagrams, logos, photographs, and other graphics hasmade desktop publishing the predominant application for scanners.andP;  Scannedimages range from two-tone line art to continuous-tone photographs, which thescanner can convert to as many as 256 gray-scale levels.andP;  Graphics softwarepackages then complete the job by cropping, rotating, and otherwise editingthe scanned illustrations to produce the best possible appearance in thefinal document.andM;Scanned images are not restricted to artwork, however.andP;  When coupled withoptical character recognition (OCR) software, scanners can bring printed textand numbers into the PC, converting the images into text or spreadsheet filesthat can be processed by standard database, word processing or spreadsheetprograms.andP;  While PC-based OCR is still relatively new, the necessary OCRsoftware is already sophisticated enough for widespread use, andinformation-demanding applications will probably provide one of the largestgrowth areas for scanner use in the years immediately ahead.andP;  (Watch for ourround-up of OCR software packages in the next issue).andM;At present, computer-aided design is a relatively small but increasing marketfor scanner use.andP;  Scanners allow line art to be incorporated into CADdrawings, but an impediment to their wider use has been the difficulty ofconverting the raster scanned images into vector CAD images.andP;  New softwarepackages will likely simplify or eliminate this problem within the next yearor so.andM;TYPES OF SCANNERSandM;There are two primary types of scanner: hand-held and page (desktop) units.andO;Handheld scanners have a scan width of between 2 and 5 inches, so they oftenrequire you to make multiple manual sweeps to read in an entire document.andO;Software is then used to merge the multiple sweeps into a single, uniformdocument.andP;  The merging process can be difficult, however, and some softwarepackages do it better than others.andP;  Although hand-held models are sometimesused for OCR applications, the inevitable wobble imparted by the human handmakes it difficult to achieve the near-perfect scan required by OCR.andO;Handheld scanners are better suited for applications involving small figuresthat can be scanned in a single pass.andM;Page scanners can handle a full page at a time.andP;  These units are furtherdivided into three categories: sheet-fed, flatbed, and overhead.andP;  From a userstandpoint, sheetfed scanners are similar in operation to typical office faxmachines.andP;  The page to be scanned is simply fed in and rollers pull itthrough the machine.andP;  (Sheet-fed scanners are also sometimes calledroller-feed scanners.) The rollers are the only moving parts in the unit; thescan optics and circuitry remain motionless as the pages flow by.andO;Functionally simpler (and thus generally less expensive) than most flatbedscanners, sheet-fed scanners have the important disadvantage of being unableto handle pages from books, pamphlets, and other bound or stapled materials.andM;Flatbed scanners are mechanically the most complex--and usually the mostexpensive--type of scanner.andP;  You operate them rather as you do a standardoffice copier.andP;  The document to be scanned is placed facedown on a glassplate.andP;  Below the glass, an optical head assembly moves along the document toscan the image.andP;  This design can easily handle books and other boundmaterials.andP;  Note that many flatbed and sheet-fed scanners also support anoptional automatic page feeder, which may be a highly valuable feature insuch applications as OCR or PC fax.andM;Overhead scanners look very much like overhead projectors.andP;  In these units,documents are placed on a flat surface and are scanned from a head that'spositioned above it.andP;  The acceptable size of the scanning surface variesamong scanner models, but since these scanners are designed with a moderatelywide field of view, most can also scan three-dimensional objects that areplaced on the target surface.andM;Note that because their scanning consistency is controlled from within and isnot subject to the unpredictable variations introduced by manual movement,page scanners of any of the three types are preferred over hand-held modelsfor OCR applications.andM;SCANNER RESOLUTION AND SCALESandM;A scanner's resolution is the number of dots it can sample for each linearinch of the document.andP;  Common resolutions are 75.andP;  100, 150, 200, 300, and400 dots per inch (dpi).andP;  But because most of today's laser printers arethemselves limited to 300 dpi, this resolution is the highest that mostscanners provide.andP;  And yet paralleling the trend toward higher-density laserprinter output, a few 400-dpi scanners have been introduced.andM;Higher scan resolutions result in larger disk files for scanned images, sincemore bits of information are stored for the image.andP;  Many scanners now offeruser-selectable scan resolution, typically allowing the user to select anystandard resolution up to the limit of the scanner.andP;  This allows smallerfiles to be created for simpler images scanned at a lower resolution, whileretaining support for higher resolution when needed.andM;The simplest scanners are bilevel devices.andP;  Also called two-tone scanners,these units are primarily used for simple drawings and other line art thatcan be represented in simple black and white.andP;  Attempting to scan photographsand other continuous-tone or halftone illustrations with a two-tone scannerresults in the loss of most of the detail.andM;Significant numbers of gray-scale scanners came on the market in 1987, makingit practical to scan photographs.andP;  Nearly all gray-scale scanners fall intoone of three categories: 16-level, 64-level, and 256-level.andP;  These are alsoknown, respectively, as 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit scanners, corresponding tothe number of bits required to store each gray-scale pixel (picture element)of information.andP;  (Just for completeness, there is at least one 128-level,7-bit scanner available.)andM;Ordinary &quot;black-and-white&quot; photographs are actually continuous-tone images.andO;That is, they contain a virtually unlimited number of shades between blackand white.andP;  Gray-scale scanners divide the range between pure black and whiteinto 16, 64, or 256 discrete shades of gray.andP;  Obviously, the more shadessupported by the scanner, the more accurate the digitized imagerepresentation can be, but since this also means storing more bits per pixel,it also results in larger image files on the disk.andP;  Naturally, too, scannercost is proportional to the number of gray levels supported.andM;HOW SCANNERS WORKandM;The operation of a typical scanner is illustrated in Figure 1 [omitted].andP;  Thedocument is illuminated by either a fluorescent or incandescent light source.andO;The reflected light goes through a lens onto a photosensor called acharge-coupled device, or CCD.andP;  The CCD is a linear array of photoelectricelements or light detectors, typically from 2,000 to 4,000 in number.andP;  Eachelement outputs a voltage proportional to the amount of light falling on it.andO;A black spot on the document absorbs most of the light, allowing very littleto reflect to the CCD; this results in a low voltage output.andP;  A white spotreflects most of the light, resulting in a high voltage output.andP;  Gray levels(or colors) between these extremes similarly cause proportional voltages tobe generated by the CCD elements.andM;The analog output voltages from the CCD elements must then be converted intodigital values.andP;  In a simple two-tone scanner a threshold voltage (usuallyadjustable) about halfway between the black-and-white voltages is chosen asthe decision point.andP;  Voltages below the threshold are considered black (0),and those above the threshold are white (1).andP;  Such a scanner thus uses 1 bitper pixel.andP;  in a gray-scale scanner, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)converts the output voltage from each element in the CCD into an appropriatebinary bit pattern that represents the intensity of the reflected lightwithin the number of bits per pixel supported by the scanner.andP;  An ADC with4-bit resolution will output binary values between 0000 (black) and 1111(white); similarly, a 6-bit ADC win output binary values between 000000(black) and 111111 (white), and so on.andP;  With either type of scanner, once theanalog voltages are converted into digital values, the resulting informationis either stored locally for further processing or is sent to the PC forprocessing or storage.andM;Each reading of all the CCD elements represents a full-width, singlepixel-row scan.andP;  Since such a scan is only one pixel-row deep, successivepixel rows are then scanned until the entire document or image has been read.andO;The CCD may be advanced to the next pixel row by one of several methods: bymanually moving the scanner (hand-held scanner), by automatically moving thescanner head  flatbed scanner), by automatically advancing the page acrossthe scanner head (sheet-fed scanner), or by automatically moving a reflectingmirror (overhead scanner).andM;Color scanners work similarly to gray-scale scanners except that they mustalso extract color information from the document.andP;  This is normallyaccomplished by using multiple scans with colored lights and filters.andP;  Newscanners to be introduced in the next year or so claim single-pass full-colorscanning.andM;Some scanners preprocess the scan image data locally before sending anythingto the PC.andP;  This is frequently done in the case of OCR applications, wherethe character-recognition software is either stored in the scanner's firmwareor else is downloaded from the PC to the scanner during the initializationprocess.andP;  With its resident OCR software, the scanner can then convert theimage file to text and send ASCII characters to the PC.andM;Most scanners, however, do not preprocess the image data.andP;  The unprocesseddigital image data is simply transferred to the computer, where it istypically stored in a disk file.andP;  Indeed, simple scanners do not even storethe binary image data locally before sending it on, but simply transfer thedata as it is converted to digital format.andP;  Once the scanner image data is inthe PC, the PC can process the image information as required, using OCRsoftware, graphics-editing software, or other utilities.andM;SCANNER IMAGE FILE STORAGEandM;What your PC does with the image data it receives is partly determined by theutility software included with the scanner.andP;  Some scanner utilities are veryflexible and allow the data to be stored in any of a number of popular fileformats.andP;  Others are restricted to one or two formats-which is fine if theseare the formats your applications use.andP;  Moreover, if you find yourselfneeding a format not supported by your scanner, all is not necessarily lost:a number of graphics-editing programs can convert between different graphicsfile formats.andP;  Most notable is HiJaak, from Inset Systems, which is capableof translating between any of 26 different file formats.andM;The file format supported by most scanners is the tagged-image file format,or TIFF.andP;  TIFF was developed by Aldus Corp. (the creator of PageMaker), withthe help of Microsoft.andP;  The latest version (5.0) of the TIFF specificationsupports gray-scale and color images in addition to black-and-white images.andM;Another file format supported by most scanners is .PCX, which is used byZSoft's popular paint program, PC Paintbrush.andP;  Other file formats supportedby a number of scanner software packages include .EPS (Adobe Systems'Encapsulated PostScript), IMG (from Digital Research's GEM software), .PIC(from Media Cybernetics' Dr. Halo), .PFF (used by Epson printers), and FAX(Group III facsimile).andP;  Proprietary formats are also used by some scannermanufacturers, such as Computer-Aided Technology's CAT file format.andM;Whatever the file format, when working with scanners, you'll need lots ofmemory.andP;  While the standard 640K of system RAM will generally suffice for thescanning process itself, 2MB or more of RAM (and a 286 or 386 processor) areoften required to manipulate or edit the scanned images, particularly thosethat involve multiple gray-scale levels.andP;  Some of the desktop publishingsoftware packages, such as Xerox's Ventura Publisher, also require additionalmemory in order to incorporate large scanned images.andM;Scanning an 8 1/2 by 11-inch document at 300 dpi with a simple two-tonescanner results in a 1MB disk file.andP;  Adding gray scale or color quicklymultiplies this size.andP;  An 8-bit gray-scale image makes an 8MB disk file, anda 24-bit RGB color image (8 bits per color) takes a whopping 24MB of diskspace! As you can see, storing a few images on your disk can quickly eat yourdisk away.andM;SCANNER INTERFACESandM;There is no single standard interface for connecting scanners to PCs.andO;Rather, three interfaces are prevalent: RS-232 (serial), the Small ComputerSystem Interface (SCSI), and the General-Purpose Interface Bus (GPEB).andP;  Thecommon RS-232 serial interface is generally relegated to low-end scanners,which are in no hurry to get information back to the PC.andP;  While aninexpensive and easily accessible interface, the serial port's slow datatransfer rate is generally irritating at best and completely unacceptable inmany cases.andM;SCSI (pronounced &quot;scuzzy&quot;) is the most commonly used interface for desktopscanners.andP;  A parallel interface capable of transferring 8 bits at a time,SCSI is finding increasing application for high-end disk drives, too, and isstandard equipment on the Apple Macintosh.andP;  SCSI is an ANSI-standardinterface and normally connects between the PC and the scanner through a50-conductor cable.andM;GPIB, another parallel interface that transfers 8-bit words, is heavily usedin electronics instrumentation, but is also well suited as a PC-to-scannerinterface.andP;  Also known as the IEEE-488 bus (a standard of the Institute ofElectrical and Electronics Engineers and an ANSI standard), this interfaceuses a cable with 24-pin connectors that look rather like shrunken Centronicsprinter connectors.andM;Some scanners connect directly to the PC's parallel (printer) port.andP;  Thisoffers an easy, inexpensive connection to the PC and is faster than theRS-232 serial port interface, but it's slower than either the SCSI or GPIBalternatives.andP;  Other, nonstandard interfaces are sometimes used.andP;  Hand-heldscanners, for example, commonly use a proprietary interface to achieve anacceptable data transfer rate at minimal cost.andM;INSTALLING A SCANNERandM;Installing a scanner is generally a straightforward procedure, thoughinevitably there are &quot;gotchas&quot; to avoid.andP;  Most scanners include an interfacecard, so be sure your computer has a free expansion slot.andP;  Further, theinterface cards often require an interrupt line and/or DMA channel for properoperation; as long as not all of your interrupt lines and DMA channels areused by other installed boards, all should be well.andP;  Of course, the fewscanners that use the computer's own serial or parallel port do not requirean expansion slot, only the presence of the specified port.andM;Whether a scanner includes an interface board or simply connects to thesystem's serial or parallel port, the unit is almost always supplied with anappropriate interface cable.andP;  Since it is generally desirable to keep thescanner physically close to the computer, most of these cables tend to berather short (6 to 10 feet).andP;  In many cases, the cable length is also arestriction of the interface being used as well.andP;  If you find it necessary ordesirable to move the scanner further away from your PC than the includedcable allows, contact the scanner manufacturer; he may have other cablelengths available.andP;  Scanners that connect to the PC's serial port can easilybe placed 50 or more feet away from the PC without incurringinterface-related problems.andM;Following the instructions included with the scanner package, configure theinterface card as necessary (in most cases the default settings will work)and install it in an available expansion slot.andP;  Most interface cards arehalf-height XT size, so any slot will work.andP;  After the scanner is placed onthe desk or cart that will be its new home, simply connect the suppliedinterface cable to both the scanner and the interface card or PC port.andP;  (Manyhand-held scanners have a preconnected cable coming out of the scanner, likea mouse, and so require only a connection to the interface board.)andM;Power for hand-held scanners is supplied through the interface cable; desktopunits are supplied with a standard AC power cable.andP;  Note that some desktopscanners include retaining screws to keep their internal mechanisms frombeing damaged during shipment.andP;  Although this information is generallyclearly indicated on the scanner itself, it's well to check the documentationbefore turning on a new scanner, for attempting to operate it with retainingscrews in place could harm the unit.andP;  Similarly, to protect the internalmechanism, any retaining screws should be reinserted before shipping thescanner or moving it any substantial distance.andM;Once the hardware) part is done, it is time to install the software suppliedwith the scanner.andP;  This may include a driver to be referenced in yourCONFIG.SYS file, a command line to be placed into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, asimple executable file, or any combination of the three.andP;  A number of desktopscanners require software to be downloaded to the scanner from the PC forinitialization or for special operations such as optical characterrecognition.andM;When the scanner software is executed at power-up, it typically tests theinterface between the PC and the scanner.andP;  If a healthy level ofcommunication is not found, an error message is displayed, though it oftengoes by so quickly that it's easy to miss.andP;  Bad cable connections or amis-set interface configuration are the usual culprits if the scanner doesnot work initially.andM;SUPPLEMENTAL SOFTWAREandM;While many scanned images are usable &quot;as is,&quot; often a few changes should bemade before an image is included in your application.andP;  Perhaps lines shouldbe added or deleted, the image should be rotated or cropped, or thegray-level shading should be altered to effect a different tone.andP;  These andsimilar modifications can be accomplished via standalone graphics editors orthose found in popular paint programs.andM;PC Paintbrush, from ZSoft Corp., is the leading paint program, and mostscanners support its .PCX graphics file format.andP;  The program'sgraphics-editing features include airbrushing, gradient fills, rotation,outlining, color redefinition, resizing, cropping, and more.andP;  It can alsoperform a certain amount of gray-scale manipulation.andM;A second popular paint program capable of accomplishing most of the commonlydesired editing functions is Dr. Halo, from Media Cybernetics.andP;  Otherprograms you may wish to consider include Inset  Inset Systems), The GraphicsLink Plus (HSC Software), Hot Shot Graphics (Symsoft), Pizazz Plus Application Techniques), and Publisher's Paintbrush (Zsoft).andM;Gray-scale images present additional complexities that may require a specialbreed of software to edit effectively.andP;  Simple graphics editors, for example,implement a gray scale by grouping dots together in a dither pattern.andP;  Thegroup of dots then becomes the new gray-scale dot (pixel) for the halftone(gray-scale) image.andP;  There are two primary drawbacks to such a procedure.andO;First, the larger pixels reduce print resolution.andP;  Printing a 300-dpi scannedimage on a standard 300-dpi laser printer with a 4-bit dither pattern (16shades of gray) reduces the print resolution to about 75 dpi, which isapproximately newspaper quality.andP;  The second disadvantage of dithering showsup if the graphics editor resizes the image.andP;  As the size is increased, theimage begins to lose its continuous-tone photographic appearance and to lookincreasingly &quot;digital&quot; or computer-generated.andM;While most of the simpler graphics editors can handle gray scale only bygenerating a dithered bitmap output, there are several programs specificallygeared toward more-sophisticated gray-scale image editing.andP;  These gray-scaleeditors can effect changes in contrast, brightness, and tone in all or inportions of an image.andP;  Some go even further and allow image retouching, linesmoothing, and other effects.andP;  Note, however, that while most of thesepackages will work with up to 256 shades of gray, few video adapters andmonitors can visually support such a wide gray-scale spectrum.andP;  Even VGA willdisplay only 64 shades of gray.andM;One of the more-advanced gray-scale editors is Picture Publisher, developedby Astral Development Corp. and sold by Microtek.andP;  (Other companies may soonbe offering it, as well.) Picture Publisher runs under Microsoft Windows andrequires VGA video.andP;  It provides not only the standard gray-scale editingfunctions, but special masking techniques and output customization, as well.andO;It is, however, limited to the 64 gray levels supported by VGA.andM;Other gray-scale image editors include Snapshot (BioScan), and ScanDoHammerlab).andP;  As mentioned above, PC Paintbrush now also incorporates somegray-scale editing features, and Xerox has indicated that it may release agray-scale image editor to complement its Ventura Publisher.andM;HARDWARE HELP FOR GRAY SCALESandM;Although much resolution is generally lost when a gray-scale image is printedon a standard 300-dpi laser printer, printing and typesetting companies oftenuse laser typesetters that can print at far higher resolutions than areavailable in the average office.andP;  Two currently popular laser typesetters arethe Linotronic L-100 (1,270 dpi) and L-300 (2,540 dpi) models.andM;When magazines print halftone images, they use variable dot sizes anddensities to display different gray levels effectively.andP;  While this cannoteasily be done on a standard laser printer (since all dots are the samesize), a few companies have developed hardware that assists laser printers inproducing high-quality gray-scale images without the severe loss ofresolution that dithering imparts.andM;Intel's Visual Edge, for example, is a gray-scale controller that works withthe HP LaserJet R and a 286 or 386 AT.andP;  The Visual Edge system includes twoboards.andP;  One plugs into an expansion slot in your computer, the other intothe LaserJet's video option port; a cable connects the two boards.andP;  TheVisual Edge circuitry then takes over control of the printer's laser in orderto vary the spacing between the printed dots.andP;  By changing the dot densities,gray levels can be added to the printed image.andP;  Using this method, a halftoneimage With up to 150 lines per inch of resolution (magazine quality) can beprinted.andM;OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITIONandM;Optical character recognition, which converts scanned documents into ASCIItext files, is one of the most exciting aspects of scanner technology.andP;  Inthe last two years capabilities that previously required a minicomputer andcost $50,000 have become available to the PC user at a fraction of thatprice.andP;  Even with its new-found relative sophistication, however, OCR stillhas much room for improvement, especially in handling the challengespresented by unusual or difficult fonts and tight character spacings.andP;  Evensimple italicized characters are often too difficult to decode.andM;When using OCR, therefore, you should realize at the outset that even verygood conversions can currently achieve only about 95 percent accuracy.andP;  If 5percent of the character translations are incorrect, however, that's 50characters (and potentially 50 words) on a 1,000-character (200-word) page.andO;Even word-processor spell-checkers will not catch all of these errors, sincesome of the incorrect characters will result in other real words (hand maybecome land, for example).andP;  Thus, always be prepared to do very carefulproofreading, since the errors that a spell-checker misses will be difficultfor you to catch, as well !andP;  OCR uses two primary approaches for interpretingcharacters from scanned images.andP;  The first is known as matrix matching orfont recognition.andP;  In this approach, the software is initially &quot;taught&quot; thecharacters and symbols for the specific fonts supported, together with theircorresponding ASCII values.andP;  To teach the software a new font, each characterand symbol of the new font is stored (typically by scanning) as a matrix ofbits representing the shape of the character or symbol.andP;  Many OCR programscome with matrices for standard fonts, so you have to teach them only fontsnot already included.andP;  In operation, the software compares each scannedcharacter with the prestored characters, looking for a match.andP;  When it findsa match, it puts the ASCII code for the character into its output text file.andM;The other approach to OCR is known as feature extraction.andP;  Also known asfeature recognition, pattern recognition, or topological analysis, this moregeneric approach involves comparing the characteristics of the scannedcharacters with a list of features each character is known to have.andP;  Forexample, the software might list the features of the letter b as &quot;a verticalline with a connecting semicircle on the lower-right portion.andP;  &quot; These basicfeatures are independent of the specific print font being used.andP;  When itfinds these features in a scanned character, the program sends thecorresponding ASCII code (62h for b) to the output file.andP;  (See &quot;TwoApproaches to Optical Character Recognition&quot;).andM;OCR packages that use feature extraction are often called omnifont packages.andO;Feature extraction requires a little more intelligence than thematrix-matching approach, but it generally offers more flexibility inhandling numerous different font types.andM;Scanners designed strictly for OCR often use an internal firmware-based OCRprogram, and are known as text scanners.andP;  Most scanners, however, rely onthird-party PC software to convert the scanned document image into an ASCIItext file.andP;  This, of course, offers the greatest flexibility, since there aremany OCR software packages from which to choose-- and some are quite good.andO;Even scanners that perform OCR internally can take advantage of PC-basedthird-party OCR packages, as long as the scanner is also capable ofoutputting an image file in TIFF format.andM;One currently popular OCR software program is OmniPage, from Caere Corp. Thispackage requires a 386 processor, otherwise you can buy an optional processorboard that will allow the program to work in a 286 system.andP;  OmniPage uses thefeature-extraction approach, and while it cannot generally handle italicizedfonts, it can handle a wide variety of standard fonts.andP;  Another popularomnifont OCR package, TrueScan, from Calera Recognition Systems, comes with acoprocessor board that plugs into your 286 or 386 AT-compatible machine.andO;Other current OCR packages include Read Right (OCR Systems), Spot OCR(Flagstaff Engineering), PC-OCR (Essex Software Publishing), CAT Reader(Computer-Aided Technology), and Catchword (Logitech).andM;A number of scanner manufacturers offer OCR software specifically designed tooperate with their own machines.andP;  DEST, for example, offers its newRecognize! for the PC Version 2.0 software, for the company's 2000 and 3000desktop scanner series.andP;  It also works with Hewlett-Packard and Microtekscanners and requires an AT or compatible system.andP;  Recognize! can even handlebold fonts and italics.andM;Another scanner manufacturer, Advanced Vision Research Systems, offers thetrainable (matrix matching) MegaRead OCR software for use with its scanners.andO;And if your needs can justify the rather hefty price of $15,950, XeroxImaging Systems offers its advanced Kurzweil Model 5000 OCR system, whichincludes scanner, software, and adapter board.andM;CHOOSING A SCANNERandM;As we've seen, there are many hardware and software options to consider whenpurchasing a scanner.andP;  The November 29, 1988, and March 28, 1989, issues ofPC Magazine contain reviews of specific scanner models.andP;  These should provehelpful once you've narrowed the field to units that meet your overallapplication requirements.andP;  A review of the relevant considerations follows.andM;In determining what image quality you can live with, you're essentiallydealing with what resolution and how many gray scales are acceptable andwhether color is needed.andP;  Scan rates vary among scanners, with fasterscanners, of course, tending to be more costly than slower ones.andP;  Remember,too, that while many scanners now offer 256 gray levels-even at 300 dpiresolution few output devices can take advantage of this much information.andP;  A64-gray-scale scanner is generally better suited for most standard halftoneimage scanning.andP;  If you want to keep cost to a minimum and expect to bescanning only line art (black and white images), a simple two-tone scannerwill suffice.andM;Moreover, while desktop scanners offer the best scan results, low-costhandheld scanners are acceptable for applications that involve only smallline art and graphics images, such as company logos.andP;  Of the desktop units,flatbed scanners generally offer the greatest flexibility and accuracy andare correspondingly the most expensive choice.andP;  Sheet-fed scanners alsoprovide good scanning results but can't handle bound materials.andP;  Overheadscanners offer the ability to scan small 3-D objects but at higherresolutions do not generally offer the same scan quality as the flatbed andsheet-fed units, since the image is further away from the scanhead.andM;For any graphics scanner, you must also make sure the scanner supports thesoftware you will be using.andP;  If your graphics software supports TEFF, youwill have no problem, and the PC Paintbrush .PCX format is also supported bymost.andP;  Any other file format will probably require the use of aformat-translation program, and while this is acceptable for occasionalapplications, it can be a burdensome extra step if required for every scannedimage.andM;If you will be doing OCR, you will want a fairly high-resolution scanner: atleast 200 dpi, with 300 dpi or higher preferred.andP;  Again, make sure thescanner works with the OCR software you are considering.andP;  While most OCRprograms will work with any TEFF file, some are designed to work only withcertain scanners.andM;And even among OCR packages that can decode information from TIFF files,some, such as Dest's Recognize!, work more efficiently when allowed tooperate directly with the specific scanners for which they are designed.andM;In determining your system requirements, bear in mind that many scannersoftware packages win not work on an XT system, but require an AT (286 or386) system.andP;  This is particularly true for OCR.andP;  System RAM is also aconcern.andP;  Scanned graphics images can take up a lot of memory, and manygraphics editors bring the entire image into RAM before editing, so 1MB to4MB of extended or expanded (EMS 4.0) memory is often required.andM;Similarly, you must make sure your hard disk has enough room to store thescanned images.andP;  And if you need to archive scanned images or transfer themto another system, remember that the image files will probably be too largeto fit on a floppy diskette, so you'll need a tape drive or other transferdevice.andM;Scanner technology is evolving rapidly, with improvements both in hardwareand software being introduced constantly.andP;  Higher resolution is becoming morecommonplace and will continue to be an area of scanner improvement.andP;  Severalcolor scanners are already available, though, like color laser printers, theyare expensive and only limited software is presently available to supportthem.andP;  Proving that color scanners can be cost effective, Microtek recentlyintroduced its MSF-3002 color scanner for under $2,700.andP;  Finally, scannersupport software--the piece of the puzzle that makes these hardware wondersuseful in real applications--is being continually refined and improved.andO;This, perhaps, will be the biggest area of scanner technology advancement.andM;The Spanish government recently began an ambitious project to archive9,000,000 documents related to Columbus's voyage with the Nina, Pinta, andSanta Maria.andP;  An image database will be stored on optical disks and willeventually be available to libraries throughout the world.andP;  This is a goodexample of how scanners are being applied in applications that could not evenhave been considered a few years ago.andP;  The future holds many more, includingsome that are sure to touch on your own productivity.andM;Roger C. Alford is a design engineer and the author of two books and manyarticles on computers and electronics.andM;SCAN THE TERMSandM;Bilevel scanner A scanner that outputs only black-and-white pixels, based ona specific threshold level.andP;  Scanned pixels darker than the threshold areconsidered black, while those lighter than the threshold are consideredwhite.andP;  No gray pixels are supported.andP;  This is also called a black-and-whitescanner.andM;Brightness A measure of the overall amount of white in an image.andP;  A purewhite image has the maximum brightness, while a pure black image has theminimum brightness.andM;CCD (charge-coupled device) An integrated circuit device containing as manyas 4,000 light-sensitive elements packed closely together in a single row.andO;When combined with the necessary optics, this device gives the scanner theability to &quot;see&quot; the document being scanned.andM;Character scanner A scanner with internal OCR software either stored infirmware in the scanner or downloaded from the PC.andP;  The scanner decodesscanned text and outputs the ASCII character values for the decodedcharacters.andP;  A character scanner is generally designed only for OCR and isnot normally used for graphics applications.andP;  Also called a text scanner.andM;Continuous-tone image An image that has a nearly infinite number of graylevels (shades) between black and white, such as a photograph.andM;Contrast The range of gray tones in an image.andP;  High contrast shows cleardelineation between light and dark objects.andP;  Low contrast tends to show manymore midrange ray tones, with almost a smearing effect.andP;  A contrast changealters all of the  ray tones of an image.andM;Data transfer rate the rate at which scanned data is transferred from thescanner to the PC.andP;  This is generally measured in bits-per-second  bps).andM;Desktop scanner A scanner designed to rest on the top of a desk or other flatsurface.andP;  There are three main types of desktop scanners: flatbed, sheet-fed,and overhead.andP;  A hand-held scanner is not a desktop scanner.andM;Dithering A method of using variable dot densities (with black dots) tosimulate various shades of gray.andP;  The more dense the dots, the darker theapparent shade of gray.andM;Feature extraction An approach to optical character recognition (OCR) thatinvolves looking for a combination of distinguishing features that canuniquely identify each standard character or symbol.andP;  For example, thesoftware might list the features of the letter b as a vertical line with aconnecting semicircle on the lower-right portion.andP;  When the characteristicsof a character being decoded match those that are stored in a table inmemory, the ASCII code for that character is sent to the output file.andO;Feature extraction is more flexible than the matrix matching alternative,since it is completely independent of the font being decoded.andP;  Featureextraction is also called feature recognition, pattern recognition, ortopological analysis.andP;  (See also matrix matching and optical characterrecognition.)andM;File formats The formats used to store scanned graphics images on-disk.andP;  TIFFis the most common scanner (graphics) file format, with .PCX, .IMG, .EPS, and.PIC being other commonly supported formats.andM;Flatbed scanner A scanner that has a flat top upon which the document to bescanned is placed facedown, in much the same way as in a conventionalphotocopier.andP;  Flatbed scanners typically offer the best scan results of anyscanner type and also cost the most.andM;Gamma correction An approach for changing the brightness (shade) of aparticular gray level (or a range of levels) wherever it appears in a graphicimage.andP;  This might entail, for example, changing all 25-percent grays in animage to 60-percent grays.andP;  Gamma correction is particularly useful inbrightening shadows or other isolated areas of an image.andM;GPIB (General-Purpose Interface Bus) A popular parallel interface bus used tointerconnect electronic devices.andP;  It is capable of transferring 8 bits at atime and is sometimes used to connect scanners to PCs.andP;  It is also known asthe IEEE-488 bus, and the HPIB (Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus).andP;  GPIB is astandard of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE) andthe American National Standards Institute ANSI).andM;Gray-scale scanner A scanner capable of determining a gray-level numericvalue for each pixel scanned.andP;  The numeric range for each pixel is determinedby the number of bits handled by the scanner.andP;  A 4-bit scanner candifferentiate 16 shades of gray between black and white, inclusive; a 6-bitscanner can differentiate 64 shades of gray.andP;  A black-and-white scanner isjust like a gray-scale scanner, but with only one bit representing twoshades.andM;Gray scale Refers to viewing an image as composed of varying shades of graybetween black and white rather than comprising only the two tones of blackand white.andP;  A gray-scale scanner sees each pixel (or dot) of an image as oneof many possible shades of gray (typically 16, 64, or 256).andP;  Bi-levelscanners see each pixel as either black or white regardless of its true shadeof gray.andP;  (See also bi-level or gray-scale scanner.)andM;Halftone A stored or printed image that simulates its continuous-toneoriginal (typically a photograph) by using a dithering process.andP;  (See alsocontinuous-tone image and dithering.)andM;Hand-held scanner A scanner held in the hand and manually swept across thedocument or image being scanned.andP;  Hand-held scanners may be either bi-levelor gray-scale scanners.andM;Image scanner A scanner used to scan images, as opposed to scanning anddecoding text.andM;Line art Drawings and other black-and-white-only images having no gray tones.andM;Matrix matching An approach to optical character recognition (OCR) in whichscanned characters are compared to specific, previously stored charactershapes.andP;  When the pixels of the scanned character match (are in the sameplace as) the stored character, the ASCII value for that character is sent tothe output file.andP;  Only previously stored  previously &quot;learned&quot;) fonts can bedecoded using this approach.andP;  Matrix matching is also called fontrecognition.andP;  (See also feature extraction and optical characterrecognition.)andM;Omnifont A term that refers to the feature-extraction approach to opticalcharacter recognition (OCR), since feature extraction can universally decodea wide range of character fonts and typestyles.andP;  (See also feature extractionand optical character recognition.)andM;Optical character recognition (OCR) The process of decoding characters (text)from scanned documents.andP;  The decoded characters are then stored in a diskfile in standard ASCII text format, allowing other programs, such as wordprocessors, database managers, and spreadsheets, to process them as needed.andO;There are two primary approaches to OCR, feature extraction and matrixmatching.andM;Overhead scanner A desktop scanner that looks like an overhead projector.andP;  Itscans documents and objects from above; documents must be placed face-up onthe scanner's flat scanning surface.andP;  Also called a copyboard scanner.andP;  (Seealso desktop scanner.)andM;Page scanner A scanner capable of scanning an entire page at a single pass,instead of requiring multiple passes over different portions of the page inorder to scan the entire page.andP;  Most desktop scanners are page scanners,while hand-held scanners are not.andM;Palette color A limited-color approach to representing color images in TIFFimage files.andP;  Typically, 8 bits are stored for each pixel, to represent thecolor of the pixel.andP;  The 8-bit palette value for each pixel then becomes anindex into red, green, and blue color tables that determine the actual colorof the pixel.andP;  (See also RGB color.)andM;Parallel port The standard IBM printer port, which is found on most Pcs.andO;It's used for connecting to a printer with a Centronics-compatible interface.andO;This interface is sometimes used to connect scanners to PCs.andM;Pixel A contraction of picture element.andP;  A pixel denotes the smallest pieceof an image (a dot) distinguishable by a scanner or output device.andP;  A scannerthat scans 300 dots-per-inch (dpi), for example, actually distinguishes 300pixels every linear inch.andM;Preview A fast, low-resolution scan of an image.andP;  A preview is used to adjustthe scanner settings and/or to select which portion of the image is to beused for the full scan.andP;  Al so called a prescan.andM;Raster image An image made up of a matrix of dots or pixels.andP;  Scanned imagesand images displayed on a standard computer monitor are examples of rasterimages.andM;Resolution A measure of how many pixels per inch a scanner is capable ofviewing.andP;  Resolution is generally measured in dots-per-inch (dpi).andM;RGB color A wide-spectrum approach to representing color images in TIFFfiles.andP;  Twenty-four bits are stored for each pixel to represent the color ofthe pixel: 8 bits for each primary color-red, green and blue.andP;  So, forexample; 7, 7, 7 is white; 0, 0,0 is black; and 0 green, 6 red, and 5 blue isa variation of magenta.andP;  The result: over 16 million possible colors.andP;  Note:with RBG color, the numbers are directly proportional to the amount of colorspecified.andP;  whereas with palette color, the amount of color is determined bylooking at a table.andP;  See also palette color.)andM;Scan To convert an image from a document or photograph into a digitized formthat can be stored on, and processed by, a computer.andP;  The resulting digitalimage is also called a scan.andM;Scan rate The speed at which a scanner can scan an image.andP;  It is normallymeasured in seconds per page for desktop scanners and inches per second forhand-held scanners.andP;  The scan rate of a desktop scanner often varies based onthe scan resolution selected.andM;SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) An American National StandardsInstitute  ANSI) standard computer parallel interface capable of sending 8bits at a time.andP;  it is frequently used to interface scanners to Pcs.andM;Serial port A PC interface port often used to connect PCs to modems and otherperipheral devices.andP;  The serial interface is relatively slow, capable oftransmitting only a single bit at a time.andP;  It is sometimes used to interfacescanners to PCS.andP;  The serial POrt is also called the RS-232 port, since theelectrical interface follows the RS-232 standard established by theElectronic Industries Associations (EIA).andM;Sheet-fed scanner A desktop scanner that operates by automatically moving thedocument being scanned (a single sheet) through the unit with rollers, inmuch the same way as in a conventional fax machine.andP;  Also called aroller-feed scanner.andP;  See also desktop scanner.)andM;Thresholding A method used to eliminate gray-scale information from a scannedimage, usually for line an or similar black-and-white applications.andP;  Agray-level threshold is first selected; all pixels lighter than the thresholdlevel are considered white, while all darker pixels are considered black.andM;TIFF  (tagged-image file format) A graphics file format jointly developed byAldus and Microsoft and universally supported by all image scanners.andP;  Itallows two-tone (black-and-white), gray-scale, palette color, and RGB colorimages to be described.andM;Variable resolution A feature available on some scanners whereby any one ofseveral supported scan resolutions can be selected by the user.andM;Vector image An image made up of line segments.andP;  CAD (computer-aided design)programs generally store images in a vector format (even though they arevisually displayed on a raster monitor) since the images are typically outputto pen plotters, which are vector devices.andM;Vectorization A method of converting raster image files, such as thosegenerated by scanners, to vector image files, such  s those used by mostcomputer-aided design  CAD) software packages.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
