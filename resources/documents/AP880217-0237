Officials said at least 18 people were killed and 14 wounded.The battle raged in and around this provincial capital of 70,000people 70 miles southeast of San Salvador, the capital.   Military officers said two detachments of about 300 leftistinsurgents each took part in the coordinated attacks, whichincluded blowing up two bridges linking the capital and Usulutan,El Salvador's eastern province.   Seven members of a civilian family _ a couple and five childrenaged 7 months to nine years _ were killed when a mortar shell hittheir one-room brick and adobe home in a poor neighborhood justoutside the 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters.   Col. Inocencio Montano, brigade commander, said five soldierswere killed in combat at advance posts outside the base perimeterand no guerrillas penetrated the base. The attack began at 12:10a.m. and lasted about three hours, he said.   Montano said four of the 55 U.S. military advisers stationed inEl Salvador were at the base when the assault began, but none wasin danger.   He said the bodies of three guerrillas were brought to the baseand two other bodies were removed by the retreating insurgents.   Radio Venceremos, the clandestine rebel transmitter, called theraid a success and claimed the attackers inflicted 190 casualties.It gave no breakdown of dead and wounded.   The coordinated attacks appeared to be the largest in scalesince the rebels hit the 4th Infantry Brigade in the northernprovince of Chalatenango last March 31. That battle cost 70 lives,including that of a U.S. military adviser, and more than 100 peoplewere wounded.   One member of the military National Police was killed in theattack on the Salvadoran Cotton Cooperative Ltd. about 5 miles westof Usulutan.   Lt. Jose Mejia Henriquez, commander of the 30-man detachmentstationed at the cooperative, said the assault began with mortarand rocket-propelled grenade fire at 12:20 a.m.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, whobegan fighting the U.S.-backed government eight years ago, havewaged a campaign of economic sabotage that includes attacks on thecoffee, cotton and sugar industries. Those industries account for80 percent of El Salvador's export earnings.   Wednesday's attacks came hours before five Central Americanforeign ministers met at a San Salvador hotel to discuss progressin implementing a regional peace plan signed Aug. 7.   Ricardo Acevedo Peralta, host minister, urged his colleagues toensure that their countries comply with the plan's prohibition ofexternal aid to insurgents.   El Salvador's Christian Democratic government accusesneighboring Nicaragua of backing the Salvadoran rebels.   Guerrillas left leaflets on streets around the infantry basecalling for popular insurrection and accusing President JoseNapoleon Duarte of ``selling national sovereignty to the UnitedStates.''   The attack's effect was evident well into the afternoon. Trucksfull of soldiers with M-16 assault rifles sped along dusty roads.Helicopters and spotter planes flew overhead.   Montano said the guerrillas retreated to the north toward SanVicente volcano, on whose slopes insurgents camp.   Lt. Mejia at the cotton cooperative said the attack there beganwith about 15 minutes of mortar fire.   ``Then they attacked shouting like Indians,'' he said on theporch of the cooperative's offices. ``They shouted at us tosurrender, calling to me by my name that it was useless to resist.''   He said he and his men held off the attackers from trenches atthe front of the cooperative, but guerrilla fighters penetratedfrom the sides and rear. Seven of the unit's open-sided warehouseswere burned.   At the Palo Seco crossing 9 miles west of Usulutan, peasantsmilled around a hole 50 feet long and 20 deep where a bridge hadbeen the day before.   Residents said the they heard a tremendous explosion at about12:30 a.m. and rebels then blew down power poles on either side ofthe road.   Local officials reported skirmishes in at least three otherprovinces _ San Miguel, Cabanas and Chalatenango.   Rebel radio said the attacks in San Miguel and the northeasternprovince of Morazan were part of a new operation they called``Death to the Killers of Herbert Anaya Sanabria.''   Anaya, coordinator of the independent Salvadoran Human RightsCommission, was assassinated Oct. 26.</TEXT></DOC>
