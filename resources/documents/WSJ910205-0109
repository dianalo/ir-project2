For the past decade, Iraq has been on an artilleryshopping spree, picking up highly sophisticated long-rangeweapons from South Africa, Austria and France, along withmaking some gigantic models of its own from imported parts.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They've managed to get a lot of artillery that outrangesall of our guns,&quot; says London-based Christopher Foss, editorof Jane's Armour and Artillery. &quot;How the U.S. Army and itsallies have allowed themselves to get so far behind is aterrible scandal.&quot;   &quot;They have us outnumbered and outranged,&quot; adds retiredU.S. Army Col. Harry Summers, a military historian. &quot;Andartillery is a big battlefield killer.&quot;   The basic battlefield guns being used by U.S. and alliedtroops in the Gulf were designed 30 years ago. Their maximumrange is about 18 miles. The Iraqi arsenal includes hundredsof guns -- designed by a mysterious artillery genius namedGerald Bull -- with a range of 24 miles. Mr. Bull wasassassinated in Belgium last March, probably by a foreignagent.   The imbalance might be even greater if Iraq has managed tobring its 210mm Al Fao self-propelled gun, the world'sbiggest and most powerful, into production. Its range isalmost 35 miles, twice that of U.S. guns. The Iraqi armydisplayed a prototype of the Al Fao at a defense-weapons showthat the government organized in Baghdad in May 1989. It,too, was designed by the Canadian-born Mr. Bull, who made abargain with Iraqi authorities after being frustrated in hisefforts to build superguns for Western powers.   All the big Iraqi guns, just like the big U.S. ones, canfire conventional, high-explosive shells, as well as chemicaland nuclear warheads. The Iraqis stock everything but thenuclear weapons.   U.S. authorities point out that they rely on a variety ofweapons, not just artillery. In a ground battle, Iraqiartillery would come under intense attack from U.S.helicopters and aircraft. But because Iraq also has thousandsof anti-aircraft weapons, these close-in attacks would bedangerous, perhaps leading to significant allied losses.   The U.S. also has a superweapon of its own -- the A-TACMS(for Army tactical-missile system, pronounced &quot;Attackems&quot;), aground-to-ground weapon with a range in excess of 60 miles.It is a saturation weapon, releasing hundreds of &quot;bomblets&quot;on its target. Jane's Mr. Foss says Iraq, by dispersing itsformations and artillery, could reduce the missile'seffectiveness.   Then, too, over the weekend the U.S. committed one of itsoldest weapons -- the mighty 16-inch guns of the battleshipMissouri, targeted at bunkered Iraqi troops.   There are three basic U.S. artillery weapons deployedagainst the Iraqis. One of them, which must be towed intoplace by a truck or some other vehicle, is a 155mm howitzercalled the M-198, first developed in 1968 and brought intoproduction 10 years later. The maximum range of itsconventional high-explosive shell is about 11 miles. The Armyand Marine Corps have bought about 1,000 of these guns.   The biggest self-propelled gun is a 203mm (eight-inch)howitzer called the M-110 A-1, first produced in 1962, and amore advanced version, the M-110 A-2. The range of the olderguns is about 12 miles; newer versions, with advanced shells,may have a maximum range of as much as 18 miles. U.S. forcesare equipped with about 1,100 of these guns.   The workhorse in the U.S. artillery arsenal is the 155mmself-propelled M-109, of which thousands have beenmanufactured in various versions since 1963. More than twodozen nations have purchased the weapon, including Iran,which bought 400. Some of these were captured by Iraq duringits war with Iran and are now part of the Iraqi arsenal. TheM-109's maximum range is about 14 miles.   With rocket-assisted rounds, some of these big guns canextend their range by a few miles, though they still fallshort of the Iraqi weapons.   The Defense Department began a howitzer extended-lifeprogram (HELP) for the old M-109 in 1984 to increase thegun's range to 18 miles, and Jane's Armour and Artilleryreports prototypes were rolled out in 1988. BMY-CombatSystems, a York, Pa., division of Harsco Corp., will deliverthe first advanced models late in the spring of 1992,presumably too late to be used in the Persian Gulf. But eventhis advanced version would be outstripped by Iraqi guns.   In August 1990, the Army asked for solicitations toproduce a newly designed, fast-firing 155mm howitzer with arange of 24 miles, equivalent to the range of big Iraqi guns.But it won't be available to Army gunners until the turn ofthe century.   &quot;One of the problems with artillery,&quot; says Jane's Mr.Foss, &quot;is that it is everybody's poorest relative, last onthe shopping list.&quot;   But not last on Iraq's shopping list. Artillery, more thantanks, is the basic weapon of the Iraqi army. In its war withIran, Iraq sometimes fired off in a single day what would bea week's supply of munitions for the U.S. Army, according tomilitary analyst Anthony Cordesman.   By the end of the war, the Iraqis had improved theirartillery fire control, doing a better job of hittingspecific enemy targets, though U.S. officials note that Iraqitarget-acquisition skills are still unsophisticated comparedwith those of the allies.   Even if the Iraqis have been unable to produce the Al Fao,they still can boast of an impressive array of big guns -- asmany as 4,000 of them, by some estimates.   Mr. Bull, the artillery genius who once worked with theU.S. Army, also designed a sophisticated 155mm towed howitzercalled the GH N-45 that was delivered by Austrian salesmen toIraq via Jordan. Iran also purchased about 200 of these guns,some of which now are almost surely in Iraq's hands. Theirmaximum range is 24 miles. More than a dozen former Austrianweapons salesmen were convicted in Vienna last week ofviolating Austria's neutrality laws; more Austrians will betried later for selling the guns to Iraq.   From France, Iraq picked up at least 85 self-propelledguns, called GCTs, with a maximum range of almost 18 miles.From South Africa, it acquired dozens of towed 155mmhowitzers, called G5s, also designed by Mr. Bull. Their rangeis 24 miles. And from Iraq's patron, the Soviet Union, havecome thousands more guns, many of them upgraded with 155mmbarrels by the Iraqis in recent years.   Ironically, the Iraqi arsenal also includes eightFrench-made 155mm self-propelled guns. The guns were sold byFrance not to Iraq but to Kuwait -- which in turn lent themto Iraq to help fight the war with Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
