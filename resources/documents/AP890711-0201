Barney Frank said Monday on why Congress did little in responseto the warnings.   Problems at HUD were outlined in dozens of reports by theagency's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress.   ``Congressional staffs just aren't big enough and members ofCongress just don't have enough time,'' said Frank, D-Mass., amember of two committees that oversee HUD programs. ``These peopleat HUD just didn't care about the programs so we had to spend mostof our time just trying to keep the programs from being destroyed.''</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mel Blanc, ``The Man of A Thousand Voices,''including the legions of Looney Tune stars such as Porky Pig, DaffyDuck, Tweety Pie, Elmer Fudd and that mischievously silly wabbitBugs Bunny, has died.

The conversion to tape now affects about 45 full-time musicians,but it has raised passions among many more who feel spontaneousentertainment is being sold out by gaming corporations.   ``We can't have this town _ which was built on live entertainment_ go the other way,'' said singer Sammy Davis Jr. ``Don't let themdo this to us.''</TEXT></DOC>
