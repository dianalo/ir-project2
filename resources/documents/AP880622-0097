No pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government troops battled communistrebels near Clark Air Base and killed the guerrilla who allegedlymasterminded an attack against U.S. servicemen last year, thegovernment news agency reported today.   The agency said shooting continued sporadically for nine hoursas soldiers chased an unknown number of New People's Armyguerrillas through a sugar cane field about five miles from thebase Tuesday.   Meanwhile, suspected communist rebels killed a policeman in aManila suburb today, police said. On Tuesday, unidentified menkilled the mayor of a nearby town as he arrived at a suburbanhospital to seek medication for his arthritic wife, police said.   In a separate development, Vice President Salvador Laurel askedPresident Corazon Aquino today to convene the National SecurityCouncil to formulate an official stand on the future of U.S.military bases in the Philippines.   ``We should close ranks on this issue because the stakesinvolved are crucial and they affect the very future of ourpeople,'' Laurel said in a letter to Mrs. Aquino. Copies of theletter were distributed to reporters by Laurel's office.   Laurel said convening the council, the country's highestadvisory group on security matters, was necessary because ofconflicting statements by government officials on the future ofClark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and four smaller installations.   Some officials have said they are against renewing the 1947lease on the bases when it expires in 1991, while others say theyfavor extending the lease provided the United States increasesmilitary and economic aid.   Mrs. Aquino has said she will respect the agreement until 1991but is keeping her options open on what to do afterward.   Officials at the central Luzon regional military command saidinitially that two rebels were killed in the fighting near Clarkbut reported later that only one rebel was slain. They said theoTher dead person was a girl caught in the crossfire.   A statement from the command identified the slain rebel only byhis alias, ``Ka (Comrade) Aries.'' It said he was allegedly one ofthe hitmen who killed three Americans and a Filipino in attacks inOctober near Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.   The Philippine News Agency later quoted Lt. Col. Amado Espino,chief of the Philippine Constabulary command in Angeles city, assaying that a captured rebel had identified Ka Aries as ``the onewho masterminded'' the Oct. 28 attacks.   The rebels have claimed responsibility for the killings and havethreatened more attacks on American targets because of continuedU.S. military assistance to the Aquino government.   Military officials said Tuesday's clash began when troopsarrived at the cane field after being tipped off about the rebels'presence in the area. They said a helicopter and an armoredpersonnel carrier were brought in three hours later.   Police in the Manila suburb of Las Pinas said Angelito Mirandadied immediately when five unidentified men sprayed him withautomatic rifle fire in the lobby of the Perpetual Help MedicalCenter. He suffered 21 bullet wounds, police said.   Miranda was mayor of the town of Bacoor in nearby Caviteprovince. His wife escaped unhurt, but a hospital security guardwas wounded in the shooting, police said.   The assailants escaped in a waiting car.   Gonzales said police have ruled out the possibility thatcommunist rebels killed Miranda. He reported members of Miranda'sfamily as saying they suspected personal motives behind theslaying, but he did not elaborate.   In neighboring Pasay City, five suspected communist gunmenkilled Patrolman Danilo Laberez today at a busy intersection nearthe domestic airport terminal, police said.   Communist guerrillas have been blamed for the slayings of about200 people in the Manila area since January 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
