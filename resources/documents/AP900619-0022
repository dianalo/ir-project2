One hundred twelve people out of 396 on board the DC-10 died asa result of the crash during an emergency landing attempt at SiouxCity last July 19.   The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday the flawthat led to the crack might have been caught if a manufacturinginspection step using chemical etching had been done on the diskcarrying engine fan blades in its final shape, rather than anintermediate shape.   Another in-service inspection should have caught the crack, theboard said, and it's not known why it didn't.   The new ultrasonic inspection routines ordered by the FederalAviation Administration last fall ``are inadequate to detect thesepotentially critical cracks,'' the board said in a letter to theFAA. These methods detect cracks by passing high-frequency soundwaves through the materials.   The board called on the FAA to require the chemical etchinginspection during manufacturing on the final, instead of anintermediate, part shape, and called for the agency to substituteanother inspection method such as electrical eddy current testingfor the in-service ultrasonic methods it ordered last fall.   Computer modeling by the manufacturer has shown that, using oneultrasonic method, such surface cracks ``could propagate from asize just below the level of detectability to a critical size insignificantly fewer than 500'' flights, and the second ultrasonicmethod ordered may be no better at spotting subsurface cracks, theboard said.   Before the crash, there was no federal requirement forinspecting the part in question, but the manufacturer'sspecifications called for airlines to look for surface cracks inultraviolet light after a special wash every time the engine wasdisassembled.   Such a test was performed 760 flights before the crash, and theengine passed. ``The safety board's investigation has revealedevidence suggesting that, at the time of this fluorescent penetrantinspection, the crack was of detectable size. ...The safety boardhas not yet determined if the crack was not detected because of aninadequate inspection method, an inadequate application of thatmethod, or a combination of both,'' the board wrote.   It did not discuss what this evidence is.   In another recommendation, the board also called on the FAA toadopt for engines the assumption now used for aircraft structureswhen calculating inspection intervals _ not that the part isflawless originally, but that it contains a flaw just below thelevel of detectability.   There were 227 General Electric Co. CF6-6 engines in service onearly models of the DC-10 containing rotor disks made from aprocess changed in 1971. Six made from the same ingot of titaniumwere removed from service and regular ultrasonic inspectionsordered for the rest made from different ingots.   The middle, tail-mounted engine of the three on the DC-10exploded in flight after a fatigue crack on the inner bore (hole inthe doughnut) surface of the rotor grew so large that it came apartwhile rapidly rotating. It was the first time such a disk haddisintegrated.   The shrapnel-like pieces of the engine severed all hydrauliclines to the plane's control surfaces, leaving the aircraft almostimpossible to control, and forcing the pilots to try to bring it tothe ground by varying the power on the two remaining, wing-mountedengines.   The aircraft manufacturer, McDonnell-Douglas Corp., has addedvalves to the hydraulic system to keep some fluid in the lines, andat least some controllability, in such an accident.</TEXT></DOC>
