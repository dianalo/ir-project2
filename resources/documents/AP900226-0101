Gen. Nicolae Cerbu, deputy of the army Signal Corps,gesturing at a bank of cassette players in a listening center inBucharest.   Ceausescu's dreaded secret police, the Securitate, tapped tensof thousands of telephones as part of its vast domestic spyingapparatus. The Securitate was officially disbanded after theDecember revolution that ended the Communist dictator's 24-yearreign and led to his execution.   The military organized a tour of the listening centers forreporters in an apparent effort to counter widespread criticismthat authorities had done too little to dismantle the Securitatestructures.   ``This is the proof that it (bugging) doesn't happen now,'' saidCol. Mihai Alexuta, another Signal Corps officer.   Military officers said that in Bucharest, the Securitatemaintained interception equipment at all 30 telephone exchanges, aswell as in factories, hotels and military offices. The signals weresent to two secret recording studios where the conversations weremonitored and transcribed, they said.   ``The first people to be targeted with these listening deviceswere (in) the army,'' said Cerbu, who added that people generallywere repulsed by this kind of activity.''   The officers said they believed they had found all the buggingcenters in Romania but they declined to say how many there were.All the eavesdropping had been stopped, they said.   The equipment will be dismantled and the parts inventoried andthen given to different ministries or military departments fortheir use, Cerbu said.   ``It's a pity to destroy these things, because they areexpensive,'' he said. ``An amplifier could be well used in a smallvillage where a ministry wants to set up telephones for people whodon't have them.''   In one of the interception centers, a room about the size of alarge broom closet located in a central telephone exchange, theofficers opened a few of 48 small gray drawers set into a metalframe. Inside were circuit boards covered with transistors.   The equipment was capable of intercepting 36 telephone calls atone time, and could be used for 18,000 different phones, Cerbu said.   In a nearby concrete building with bars on the windows, whichthe officers said was a former Securitate headquarters, reporterswere led up a narrow staircase to rooms filled with a series ofcabinets, each containing 12 small built-in cassette players. Infront were desks with switchboards.   In one room were desks topped with gray metal transcriptionmachines attached to sets of headphones. The fuses had been cut andsome of the equipment was dismantled.   The officers said different departments of the Securitateordered the centers to monitor individuals, then requested thetapes or manuscripts.   None of the cassettes had been found, the officers said. Theysaid they did not know why.   Cerbu said authorities had begun cutting power to the devicesfrom the start of the revolution, ``because we knew that with them,the orders of commanders of troops in the revolution could beoverheard.''   The armed forces sided with popular demonstrators to oustCeausescu.   The military knew some of the listening rooms existed, andtechnical staff at some of the centers alerted them to others, hesaid.   The fate of the Securitate is one of the most hotly discussedissues in Romania. Only a handful of the 15,000 full-time officersof the secret police have been put on trial, and officials providedfew details on the dismantling of the security force in the firsttwo months after the revolution.   In recent days, however, the Defense Ministry has said more than3,500 senior members of the force have been dismissed, andstate-run TV has shown eavesdropping centers in various cities.</TEXT></DOC>
