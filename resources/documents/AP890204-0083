Now,with the day of reckoning near, President Bush's efforts to financehis campaign promises are meeting unexpected complications.   The difficulty of crafting a rescue plan for the troubledsavings-and-loan industry and disagreement over defense spendinglevels are making it harder for budget officials to finish rewritingformer President Reagan's $1.15 trillion fiscal 1990 budget,according to administration and congressional sources.   Bush goes before a joint session of Congress and a nationwidetelevison audience Thursday to hang a pricetag on his campaign vowsand to show how he'll meet Gramm-Rudman defict targets whileadhering to his ``read my lips, no new taxes'' slogan.   Bush's budget, according to sources, probably won't look as goodon paper as did Reagan's, which proclaimed a deficit reduction inthe upcoming fiscal year to $92.8 billion _ down from the estimated$161.5 billion in the current year.   The new budget will project a deficit barely under the $100billion ceiling called for in the Gramm-Rudman law, which aims for abalanced budget by 1993 through declining annual steps, the sourcessaid.   The president's campaign proposals for new spending on education,child care, the homeless and environmental cleanup add up to wellover $5 billion _ money that his administration is finding all butimpossible to squeeze from already tight federal ledgers.   With just a few days to go, Bush aides said, many pivotaldecisions have yet to be made by the president, including whether togo along with his predecessor's proposed $4 billion increase indefense spending, or to freeze it at the rate of inflation _ whichwould free up about $2 billion for other programs.   Although Bush has generally proposed a ``flexible freeze'' thatwould hold overall spending at the rate of inflation, some keyaides, including Chief of Staff John Sununu, have reportedly beenpressing for higher levels of defense spending.   Administration officials, who insisted upon anonymity, have saidBush's budget will call for lower defense spending than proposed byReagan, but how much lower had not yet been determined.   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said theadministration is looking into the option of no growth except forinflation, possibly over a three-year period.   The administration officials also said that some of Bush'scampaign promises will surface in scaled-back form in the budget, ornot be financed at all. Still, a senior official said that the majorones would at least be noted, if not fully paid for.   Among Bush's more ambitious campaign promises: a $1,000child-care tax credit for low-income families; a $500 millionNational Merit School program to aid the country's best schools; amultiyear $5 billion program to attack acid rain; expansion ofMedicaid, housing vouchers for the poor and a new tax-freeindividual savings plan.   Bush will also have to find money in his budget to pay forcleaning up deteriorating nuclear plants.   Given his no-tax pledge and the tightness of available funds, itseems unlikely that Bush can afford to retreat from Reagan'sproposal to ax more than five-dozen programs; or to restore much ofthe $5.5 billion cuts in Medicare proposed by the former president.   Coming up with a budget plan in time for Thursday's address toCongress has been complicated by the savings-and-loan crisis.Federal regulators say that from $85 billion to $100 billion will beneeded to shore up the industry.   Bush and his top financial advisers were huddled Saturday at thepresidential retreat at Camp David, Md., trying to work out asolution.   An original trial balloon by the administration to chargedepositors a fee of 25 cents for each $100 on deposit was quicklydeflated on Capitol Hill. Still, White House aides were reluctant torule it out entirely, claiming the means for raising the rescuefunds had dwindled to a precious few.   Congressional speculation as of Saturday was that theadministration would propose raising the money through the sale ofspecial 30-year Treasury bonds, with an increase in insurance feespaid by financial institutions to cover the $6 billion to $7 billioncost of servicing, or paying interest on, the bonds.   The president also must make room in his budget for his proposalto reduce the tax on capital gains to a maximum of 15 percent _ andthen to use what he claims will be increased revenues from that moveto pay for other tax breaks.   Those include restoring tax benefits for the oil and gas industryand establishing tax-free ``enterprise zones'' in inner cities.   In all, it's a big order for a new president who conceded even inhis inaugural address that there was ``more will than wallet.''   In a speech Friday to a group of business leaders, Bush said,``next week, we're going to have to come forward with some toughdecisions.''   And, he added, ``I've heard from a lot of you here the importanceof having what we send up there credible, so that world markets willunderstand that this is for real.''</TEXT></DOC>
