The bill, approved by voice vote, would require U.S. corporations to terminate nearly all investments in South Africa and end all trade within a year. Five other House committees already have approved the measure. The bill would go beyond the sanctions Congress imposed in 1986 over President Reagan's veto that bar new U.S. investment and loans, among other measures.    The Senate has been waiting for the House to act before it takes up the issue of whether to impose more sanctions to try to force Pretoria's white-minority government to dismantle apartheid. Senate staff members have been considering measures that go beyond the current sanctions but aren't as harsh as those imposed by the House bill.    Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis advocates a &quot;comprehensive trade embargo&quot; of South Africa, rather than sending what he calls the &quot;mixed signals&quot; of the Reagan administration. </TEXT></DOC>
