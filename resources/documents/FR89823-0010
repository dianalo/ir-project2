The purpose of today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice is to codify EPA's approval of Indiana'sbase hazardous waste management program and two revisions to this program.On January 31, 1986, EPA published a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice announcing its decision to grant finalauthorization to Indiana (see 51 FR 3953, January 31, 1986). On October31, 1986 and January 5, 1988, EPA published <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices announcing its decisions to grant Indianafinal authorization for two separate program revisions to its hazardouswaste management program (see 51 FR 39752, October 31, 1986 and 53 FR 128,January 5, 1988). The October 31, 1986, <T4>Federal Register </T4>announced EPA's approval of changes to the nameand organization of the lead State agency. Effective April 1, 1986, IndianaPublic Law 112-1986 (Act) amended Indiana Public Law 143-1985 (Act) reorganizingthe Indiana agency responsible for administering the hazardous waste managementprogram. Prior to April 1, 1986, the Indiana hazardous waste managementprogram was the responsibility of the Indiana State Board of Health (ISBH);the program was implemented by ISBH's Division of Land Pollution Control.On April 1, 1986, Indiana Public Law 143-1985, as amended by Indiana PublicLaw 112-1986, created a new State agency entitled the Indiana Departmentof Environmental Management (IDEM). The Division of Land Pollution Controlbecame an office within the IDEM entitled the Office of Solid and HazardousWaste Management. The organizational structure, the staff composition,and most importantly, the State's regulatory and statutory equivalenceto the Federal RCRA program were in no way altered by this statutory reorganizationof the RCRA program to the new agency. The final authorization for thisprogram revision became effective on December 31, 1986.The January 5, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>announced EPA's approval of Indiana's equivalentrules for the following Federal hazardous waste regulatory amendments:(1) Exclusion of Household Waste (49 FR 44980, November 13, 1984);(2) Interim Status Standards Applicability (49 FR 46095, November 21, 1984);(3) Corrections to the Test Methods Manual (49 FR 47391, December 4, 1984);(4) Satellite Accumulation (49 FR 47391, December 20, 1984);(5) Redefinition of Solid Waste (50 FR 614, January 4, 1985);(6) Interim Status Standards for Landfill Cover Design Standards (50 FR16044, April 23, 1985);(7) Design Standards (50 FR 16044, April 23, 1985);(8) Correction to Redefinition of Solid Waste (50 FR 33541, August 20,1985), and;(9) Clarification of Spent Pickle Liquor Listing (51 FR 19320, May 28,1986).Indiana submitted an application requesting approval of these rule changeson June 29, 1987. That application contained a description of the rulechanges, a revised Memorandum of Agreement, an Attorney General's Statementcertifying the equivalence of the State rules and a copy of the rules.EPA approved of the rule changes and the State application in the January5, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The final authorization for this program revisionbecame effective on January 19, 1988.EPA has decided to codify its approval of State programs in part 272 oftitle 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and to incorporate by referencetherein the State statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce undersection 3008 of RCRA. The intended codification reflects the State programthat was in effect when EPA granted Indiana final authorization under section3006(b) for its revised hazardous waste program. This effort will provideclearer notice to the public of the scope of the authorized program ineach State. Such notice is particularly important in light of the Hazardousand Solid Waste Act Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), Public Law 98-616. Revisionsto State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal statutoryor regulatory authority is modified. Because HSWA extensively amended RCRA,State programs must be modified to reflect those amendments. By codifyingthe authorized Indiana program and by amending the Code of Federal Regulationswhenever a new or different set of requirements is authorized in Indiana,the status of federally approved requirements of the Indiana program willbe readily discernible.The Agency will only codify for enforcement purposes those provisions ofthe Indiana hazardous waste management program for which authorizationapproval has been granted by EPA. Concerning HSWA, some State requirementsmay be similar to HSWA requirements that are in effect under Federal statutoryauthority in that State. However, a State's HSWA-type requirements arenot authorized and will not be codified into the CFR until the RegionalAdministrator publishes his final decision to authorize the State for specificHSWA requirements. Until such time, EPA will enforce the HSWA requirementsand not the State analogues.To codify Indiana's authorized hazardous waste program, EPA will add subpartP to part 272 of Title 40 of the CFR. Subpart P has previously been reservedfor Indiana. Sections 272.751(a) (1)-(3), and 272.751 (b)-(d) intend tocodify for enforcement purposes, the State statutes and regulations, theMemorandum of Agreement, the Attorney General's Statements, the ProgramDescriptions, and a letter from the State Health Commissioner which areauthorized and made part of the hazardous waste management program underSubtitle C of RCRA.The Agency retains the authority under Sections 3007, 3008, 3013 and 7003of RCRA to undertake enforcement actions in authorized States. With respectto such enforcement action, the Agency will rely on Federal sanctions,Federal inspection authorities, and the Federal Administrative ProceduresAct rather than the authorized State analogues to these requirements. Therefore,the Agency does not intend to codify for purposes of enforcement such particular,authorized Indiana enforcement authorities. Section 272.751(a)(2) liststhose authorized Indiana authorities that would fall into this category.The public also needs to be aware that some provisions of the State's hazardouswaste management program are not part of the Federally authorized Stateprogram. These non-authorized provisions are not part of the RCRA SubtitleC program because they are ``broader in scope'' than RCRA Subtitle C (see40 CFR 271.1(i)). As a result, State provisions which are ``broader inscope'' than the Federal program are not codified for purposes of enforcementin part 272. Section 272.751(a)(3) of the intended codification simplylists for reference and clarity the Indiana statutory and regulatory provisionswhich are ``broader in scope'' than the Federal program and which are not,therefore, part of the authorized program being codified. ``Broader inscope'' provisions will not be enforced by EPA; the State, however, willcontinue to enforce such provisions.As noted above, the Agency is not amending part 272 to include HSWA requirementsand prohibitions that are immediately effective in Indiana and other States.Section 3006(g) of RCRA provides that any requirement or prohibition ofHSWA (including implementing regulations) takes effect in authorized Statesat the same time that it takes effect in non-authorized States. Thus, EPAhas immediate authority to implement a HSWA requirement or prohibitiononce it is effective. A HSWA requirement or prohibition supersedes anyless stringent or inconsistent State provision which may have been previouslyauthorized by EPA (See 50 FR 28702, July 15, 1985).Because of the vast number of HSWA statutory and regulatory requirementstaking effect over the next few years, EPA expects that many previouslyauthorized and codified State provisions will be affected. The States arerequired to revise their programs to adopt the HSWA requirements and prohibitionsby the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21, and then to seek authorizationfor those revisions pursuant to part 271. EPA expects that the States willbe modifying their programs substantially and repeatedly. Instead of amendingthe part 272 codification every time a new HSWA provision takes effectunder the authority of RCRA 3006(g), EPA will wait until the State receivesauthorization for its analog to the new HSWA provision before amendingthe State's Part 272 codification. In the interim, persons wanting to knowwhether a HSWA requirement or prohibition is in effect should refer to40 CFR 271.1(j), as amended, which lists each such provision.The codification of State authorized programs in the CFR should substantiallyenhance the public's ability to discern the current status of the authorizedState program and clarify the extent of Federal enforcement authority.This will be particularly true as more State program revisions to adoptHSWA provisions are authorized.<ITAG tagnum="84">Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. It intends to codify the decision already made to authorizeIndiana's program and has no separate effect on handlers of hazardous wastein the State or upon small entities.
