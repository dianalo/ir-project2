Eight years ago, as the party out of power, Republicans ran on a document that was peppered with references to the Soviet threat and proclaimed that American aid abroad isn't &quot;a charitable venture.&quot; By contrast, the platform that goes before the convention today features U.S. support for &quot;child survival&quot; programs in the Third World and addresses specific concerns of American Jews, Irish and Armenians -- even as the writers say less about Moscow.    This shift not only shows a party grappling with the changing U.S.-Soviet relationship but also is designed to counter Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis's appeal to ethnic voters. A major goal is to drive a wedge between the Massachusetts governor and Jewish voters by playing on fears regarding the Rev. Jesse Jackson and what critics see as inconsistencies in Mr. Dukakis's own foreign-policy and defense views. The platform takes an unusually strong pro-Israel position; Thomas Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, yesterday called it &quot;truly the best statement of America's interests in that part of the world that has been produced by either party in history . . . a remarkable document.&quot;    Though Republicans can't expect to capture a majority of the Jewish vote, their goal is to increase their share above the 30%-35% won by President Reagan four years ago. &quot;We think there is a big opening there,&quot; says Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.).    Jewish voters make up only a small portion of the overall electorate, but they could have an impact in those states where they are concentrated. Mr. Dukakis and Vice President George Bush are likely to split New York and Florida, but in California, New Jersey and Illinois, the GOP strategy could affect what are expected to be closely fought races.    The Republican platform goes beyond the Democrats by totally opposing the creation of any independent Palestinian state. And it taps old resentments toward the United Nations by citing the U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism.    In a more subtle -- some say dubious -- maneuver, the document attempts to equate support of Israel with the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. The SDI budget currently finances an estimated $158 million U.S.-Israeli venture to develop an anti-tactical ballistic missile, dubbed the &quot;Arrow,&quot; to counter new threats from Soviet and Chinese weapons sold to Arab nations. Though Mr. Dukakis supports this three-year joint project, Republicans insist that he is inconsistent in also demanding cuts from the larger SDI program.    &quot;Why in principle should it be different for Israeli citizens to develop this weapon and the U.S. not to have SDI?&quot; asks William Schneider, a former undersecretary of state who participated in the platform sessions and has represented Israeli-government arms manufacturers. &quot;It is a real confrontation of values and loyalties on the part of the candidate.&quot;    A respected conservative, Mr. Schneider also had a hand in writing the platform on which Ronald Reagan was elected eight years ago. That 1980 document, rather than the 1984 version, is a better benchmark for the Reagan administration and provides a revealing contrast with the platform on which Mr. Bush will run.    In the 1980 platform, &quot;Peace and Freedom&quot; were the watchwords of the foreign-policy chapter, which focused on the threat of Soviet &quot;global ambitions.&quot; Sections on the Mideast, Africa and Asia included as many as 20 references to the Soviet Union. Today's platform has just a third this number and is entitled &quot;America Leading the World.&quot;    The &quot;Americas&quot; section comes before the one on U.S.-Soviet relations, and &quot;Combatting Narcotics: Defending Our Children&quot; before Europe. The flag is still waved, but there's also encouragement of new investment in Northern Ireland. Though Mr. Reagan's record has favored military aid over economic assistance, the platform takes credit for U.S. contributions to child-health programs in developing nations.    In a slap at the State Department, conservatives added language last week criticizing Mozambique for its reliance on military support from communist nations. But when the same delegates proposed an amendment describing &quot;Marxism-Leninism&quot; as a greater threat to freedom than apartheid, they were beaten back by Southern Republicans mindful of the importance of the South Africa issue to the region's large black vote.    What remains consistent in the 1980 and 1988 platforms is a willingness for the U.S. to act without its allies on occasion. By the same token, the new platform tends to attribute any improvement in world relations to the U.S. alone. For instance, Mr. Reagan's policies are given credit for elevating Mikhail Gorbachev and for motivating recent peace negotiations in Africa, the Mideast and Asia.    The Iran-Contra affair is never mentioned. &quot;We had a word limit,&quot; said one drafter, smiling. </TEXT></DOC>
