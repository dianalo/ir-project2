The hurricane, with 125 mph winds, destroyed about 90 percent ofthe buildings in the Caribbean city of Bluefields and slashedthrough the Corn Islands off the Nicaraguan coast. The two areashave a population of about 68,000.   Although thousands were evacuated, thousands of others remainedin their homes despite warnings, President Daniel Ortega said in aspeech broadcast on radio and television.   Initial reports said 15 Nicaraguans were killed Saturday and theoverall death toll from the storm that began ravaging the South andCentral American coasts last Monday was at least 65 in Nicaragua,Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.   The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, but torrential rainscontinued and Nicaraguan officials said they would order forcedevacuations if need be as the storm struck Managua, 180 miles westof Bluefields.   David Zuniga, director of civil defense, angrily called forpeople to go to shelters.   ``Sandinista police and the EPS (the army) have orders toevacuate by force if necessary,'' Zuniga said on television.   Some who refused to evacuate low-lying ground said they didn'tbelieve the government, which has on numerous occasions called onthe people to mobilize against a U.S. invasion.   ``The people were tired of these calls. They don't believethem,'' said Ruben Hernandez, who refused to evacuate his home inthe Las Torres neighborhood on the edge of Lake Managua.   ``The government has told us so many lies that we just don'tbelieve them any more,'' said a Managua woman who spoke with thecondition she not be identified.   Others said people didn't realize what damage a hurricane couldinflict _ the last hurricane to strike Nicaragua was in 1911.Government radio repeatedly issued storm warnings.   Ortega said during his address that he had visited Bluefields onFriday and urged people to leave.   ``I told the people to leave their homes because it is easier torebuild your home than to reconstruct your life,'' he said.   Only a few thousand people left Bluefields in a governmentevacuation program Friday, although others fled coastal zones.   Authorities feared Joan's heavy rains could cause more flooding,especially in Managua, which is relatively flat and poorly drained.   Thousands of refugees from the seven-year civil war with theU.S.-supported rebels known as Contras have moved into Managuya,swelling its population to 1 million. Many live in wooden shacksbeside dirt fields.   Civil defense committees piled sand bags in front of manybuildings, cut tree limbs that might be blown down and cleareddrainage ditches. Windows of the eight-story Hotel Intercontinentalwere taped over.</TEXT></DOC>
