Says</HEAD><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.N. official said today that largenumbers of guerrillas have left Namibia and returned to Angolaafter clashes with South African-led troops that jeopardized a planfor the territory's independence.   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. monitoringforce in Namibia, told reporters that ``substantial numbers'' ofguerrillas had left northern Namibia since midday Wednesday. Hegave no figures.   South Africa, which has agreed to end its 74-year rule overNamibia, claimed that about 1,600 guerrillas of the South-WestAfrica People's Organization crossed into the territory from Angolabeginning April 1.   The resulting clashes with South African-led security forcesresulted in the deaths of 305 guerrillas and 27 members of thesecurity force, according to South African officials.   Under a regional peace plan that provides for Namibia'sindependence, the guerrillas were supposed to have remained attheir bases in Angola until mid-May, when they were to returnunarmed.   Guerrilla leaders have denied violating the agreement and saidsome of their forces already were in Namibia.   To encourage the guerrillas' withdrawal, South Africa hasconfined its forces in northern Namibia to their bases for a60-hour period that began Wednesday evening and is to end atdaybreak Saturday.   South African officials have made clear they want a fullguerrilla withdrawal by the end of the period, although they havenot disclosed what steps they would take if they believe guerrillasremain in Namibia.   Guerrilla leaders, in a statement issued Thursday, said 1,337guerrillas had ``redeployed'' from Namibia to Angola. The statementdid not specify the period during which this withdrawal occurred,nor did it say how many guerrillas remained in Namibia.   If both SWAPO's figures and South Africa's estimate about thesize of the incursion are accurate, there would be few, if any,guerrillas, still in the territory.   SWAPO said its guerrillas ``have been running the gantlet ofSouth Africa troops' ambushes ... as well as a blockade along theNamibia-Angola border where South Africa has deployed a division ofits troops to hunt down and kill them.'' The statement said allguerrillas in Namibia would soon move to Angola as long as securityforces ``do not impede their way.''   The independence plan is part of an agreement that also providesfor withdrawal of South African and Cuban forces from Angola. U.S.,Soviet, Angolan, Cuban and South African delegations met Thursdayand today in Cape Town, South Africa, to discuss the status of theaccord.   In Cape Town, roving Soviet Ambassador Vyacheslav Ustinovpredicted today that the regional peace process would be back tonormal within a month.   Ustinov, making the first official Soviet visit to South Africain 33 years, said: ``I believe that we can make a step in the rihtdirection and at least we have succeeded in clarifying a number ofvery delicate points and overcome some difficulties, but still alot is left.''</TEXT></DOC>
