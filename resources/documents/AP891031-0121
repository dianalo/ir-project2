While some economists discounted the increase because of thespecial factors relating to the start of the school year, otheranalysts called the wage gain a worrisome indication of underlyinginflationary pressures.   The 1.6 percent increase in wages and salaries in thedepartment's Employment Cost Index followed a gain of 0.8 percentin the April-June period.   The biggest wage gains in the past three months came in thegovernment sector, where the pricetag for salaries is traditionallyhigher because of new contracts for teachers at the start of theschool year.   Teacher contracts also were a major factor in pushing wage ratesup by 1.3 percent in the July-September period last year.   The gain in wages and salaries excludes the cost of otherbenefits paid by employers, such as health care. When those costsare added, total employment compensation rose 1.6 percent in thepast three months, up from a 1.1 percent advance in the April-Junequarter. That advance was also higher than a 1.3 percent rise inthe July-September quarter a year ago.   ``Both the wage and salaries increase and the total compensationincrease are uncomfortably high,'' said Allen Sinai, chiefeconomist of the Boston Co.   Some analysts blamed the higher wage gains on the sharpincreases in consumer prices that occurred at the first of theyear. They said that new wage contracts were an effort by workersto keep their purchasing power from being eroded by inflation.   Consumer prices have moderated in recent months as food andenergy costs have returned to more modest levels, but analysts saidthe real danger will be if the earlier spurt of higher inflationgets embedded in wage demands, setting off an inflationarywage-price spiral.   ``The effects of higher inflation earlier in the year areshowing up in new contracts,'' said Michael Evans, head of aWashington forecasting company. ``The question is: Can it be turnedaround?''   Sinai said the Federal Reserve is paying particularly closeattention to wage pressures in the economy and won't consider itswar against inflation won until these increases begin to moderate.   For that reason, he said he wasn't looking for any significantmove on the part of the central bank toward lowering interest rates.   For the 12 months ending in September, wages and salaries roseby 4.6 percent, up from a 3.9 percent increase in the previous12-month period. Total compensation costs rose 5.1 percent for thepast 12 months, compared with an increase of 4.7 percent for the 12months ending in September 1988.   The costs of benefits alone grew by 6 percnt in the past 12months, compared with a 6.7 percent increase posted for the sameperiod ending in September 1988.   However, the smaller rise in benefit costs was attributablealmost entirely to the fact that the Social Security tax did notrise this year, after climbing by 5 percent in 1988.   Wages and salaries for private sector workers were up 4.4percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 5.5 percent increasein wages for state and local government workers.   Salaries for school teachers, college and university professorsand health and hospital workers in the public sector all rose bymore than 6 percent in the last 12 months, the Labor Departmentsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
