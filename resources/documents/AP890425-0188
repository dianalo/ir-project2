The opposition parties also demanded criminal charges againstthe diplomat in part to show good faith to Britain, which is upsetbecause the transaction reportedly involved delivery of spare partsfor its Blowpipe missile launcher.   French authorities said they took South African diplomat DanielStorm into custody last week with an American and three members ofthe Ulster Defense Association, the largest paramilitary group inNorthern Ireland. French authorities said they were arrested in araid on a hotel room where parts of the British-made missile systemwere being delivered to the South African.   The three Irishmen and the American, identified as Genevabusinessman Douglas Bernhart, are being held on charges ofgun-running and conspiracy. Storm, who is posted in Paris, wasreleased after claiming diplomatic immunity. Colin Eglin, foreignaffairs spokesman for the moderate opposition Democratic Party,said if Storm was involved ``in murky arms deals with terroristorganizations, there is no doubt the minister of defense shouldresign.''   Foreign Minister Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malanboth have said the government sometimes uses unconventional methodsto obtain arms technology to circumvent a U.N. arms embargo, butboth denied South Africa was supplying arms to any terroristorganization.   They have said Storm's activities will be investigated.   Published reports in Britain say South Africa has supplied armsto Protestant groups in return for blueprints of the Blowpipe, ashoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile made at Short Brothers, afactory in Belfast, Northern Ireland.   The Democratic Party's defense spokesman, Dave Dalling, saidStorm should be charged as soon as he returns to South Africa tohash out the whole affair in an open court.   ``Presumably, it is a criminal offense for a South Africancitizen to conduct arms dealings with terrorist organizations,''said Dalling.   He said such a step would demonstrate to the British governmentSouth Africa's good faith.   Spokesmen for the right-wing Conservative Party opposition havealso called for a government explanation.   In London on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe toldSouth Africa's visiting finance minister, Barend Du Plessis, thathe viewed with ``the utmost seriousness'' any supply of arms toviolent groups in Britain's strife-torn province of NorthernIreland.   The reports, embarrassing for South Africa, are clouding whatBritish officials have claimed is a successful policy by PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher toward South Africa. She refuses toimpose tough embargoes while pressing the white-controlledgovernment to share political power with the black majority.   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper in Johannesburg, said,``Whatever happens now, the incident will affect our credibility asa country opposed to terrorism in any shape or form.''   The government accuses the major armed opponent of its apartheidsystem of racial segregation, the African National Congress, ofengaging in terrorism.</TEXT></DOC>
