Greg Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service saysU.S. agriculture has shown a strong recovery from the early 1980s.   ``Since the start of 1987, farm incomes and finances haverebounded more strongly than anticipated,'' he said. ``Net cashincome is projected to average $56 billion (annually) during1987-89, about $10 billion higher than the 1984-86 average, whiledebt fell more than 10 percent in 1987-88.''   Farm exports have rebounded by 40 percent since the mid-1980s,and there has been a reduction of 3.3 billion bushels in the U.S.stockpile of corn, wheat and soybeans.   ``Higher prices brought about by lower stocks and strong exportdemand likely will extend the financial recovery through the end of1989 and into 1990,'' Hansen said in the July issue of AgriculturalOutlook magazine.   But how solid is the recovery? The 1980s began with ``a bloatedcost structure that was a precondition for the ensuing financialcrisis,'' he said. Will farmers avoid a repetition in the 1990s?   Hanson hedges a bit, noting that there are many factors beyondthe control of individual farmers: global weather patterns,multilateral trade negotiations and currency exchange rates, forexample.   But he also notes that many fundamentals of the farm economy arestronger and that agriculture is now a growth industry:   _Crop sales receipts have increased 23 percent and livestocksales 12 percent since 1986, with farm output expected to beslightly higher this year than in the mid-1980s.   _Capital investment is up one-third, with spending on newtractors, machinery and buildings expected to be about $3 billionmore than in 1986.   _Farm real estate values are forecast up one-sixth since 1986,with land values rising slightly faster than inflation this year.   Hanson said the reduced stockpile of commodities and a growingdemand for those products ``undergird current sales strength andinvestment growth'' in U.S. agriculture. Long-term factors suggestthat ``supply will not soon dwarf demand, and that farmers will notsoon experience another deep financial crisis'' like the one in themid-1980s.   One reason for optimism, he said, is the Conservation ReserveProgram, which will idle 30 million or more acres a year through themid-1990s under long-term agreements with farmers to protect fragilecrop land. The goal actually is 40 million to 45 million acres.Comparatively, an average of 23 million acres were idled between1979 and 1985.   A cheaper U.S. dollar bodes well for farm exports, Hanson said.One dollar bought about 40 percent less German and Japanese currencyin 1987-89 than in 1984-85.   ``This makes U.S. exports more competitive with Europeanproducers, and U.S. farm commodities cheaper for Japaneseconsumers,'' he said. ``Given the continuing U.S. trade and budgetdeficits, it is not likely that the dollar will rebound for anextended period to mid-1980 levels.''   Another hopeful sign is the improved state of farm finances,Hanson said. Between 1985 and 1988, the number of commercial farmerswith annual sales of at least $40,000 who faced loan defaultdeclined by about 50 percent to 60,000.   Farm debt also fell by $45 billion over a six-year period,putting producers in a much stronger financial position than in themid-1980s.   ``This provides a cushion that will enable most farmers towithstand one or more years of reduced profits should agriculturalgrowth slow or stall in the next few years,'' he said.   Another factor is difficult to judge, but it's there: Farmers aresurvivors.   ``Today's farmers have survived a cost-price squeeze and thefinancial problems brought about by land-value deflation after debttripled in the 1970s,'' Hanson said. ``They have survived all thebusiness problems of a major crisis, and in the process have learnedvaluable lessons.''   For example, he said, record net cash incomes in 1986, 1987 and1988 ``tended to be used conservatively to pay down debt and makeneeded investments and improvements.''   While land values and investments have rebounded from 1986 lowmarks, farm debt continued to fall in 1988 and is forecast to bestable in 1989. Up to 75 percent of this debt reduction is fromfarmers paying off loans, not loan losses.   ``Farmers likely will continue to avoid an over-investmenttrap,'' Hanson said. ``There is heightened awareness of thelong-term importance of daily cost control and sound management.''   He added: ``This is an intangible factor that is as important ashigher commodity prices, lower stocks, more competitive exchangerates, and less financial stress.''   Lest he appear too rosy about the future, Hanson said a number ofthings could happen to cloud the situation.   Recurrence of a cost-price squeeze could be one of the threats,along with continued heavy reliance on government payments, lowerprofits in the livestock sector, unsuccessful trade negotiations ormajor scientific breakthroughs that could cause lower prices.</TEXT></DOC>
