But a convocation of Moslem clergy in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,condemned the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and said the U.S.-ledmultinational force's presence was justified by Iraq's invasion.   Late Thursday, the U.N. Security Council voted 13-2 to allowfood shipments to Iraq and occupied Kuwait only ``to relieve humansuffering'' and said relief agencies must distribute the aid.   Cuba and Yemen, the only Arab nation on the council, votedagainst the resolution, which was sponsored by the United States,the Soviet Union and four other countries.   Meanwhile in Tokyo, the Japanese government announced Fridaythat it will provide an additional $3 billion in aid to more than$1 billion already promised to assist peacekeeping forces in thePersian Gulf region and nations suffering from the U.N.-sponsoredembargo against Iraq.   Members of the U.S. Congress had complained Japan was not doingmore in the crisis, and had not contributed enough in light of itshigh dependence on Middle East oil. Iraq and Kuwait possess 20percent of the world's oil reserves, second only to Saudi Arabia.   Chief government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said Japan'sincreased contribution was not in response to U.S. demands but washis country's ``contribution to the world based on the UnitedNations resolutions. ... We are not only listening to what theUnited States says.''   Sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum Japancould provide at this point.   In another development, the U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia saidthe flow of equipment for American forces into Saudi Arabia waseight days behind schedule. The commander, though, said the troopsand military hardware already there were sufficient enough to stopany Iraqi attack.   Iraq's warning came in a memorandum to the U.S. charged'affaires in Baghdad, according to the Iraqi News Agency,monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. It said Iraq was responding to a U.S.claim that Iraq-based terrorists were preparing to attack U.S.targets.   The United States is creating a ``pretext'' for aggression, thememorandum was quoted as saying, and ``Iraq reserves its legitimateright to self-defense, to reciprocate and to retaliate firmlyagainst these parties if it becomes a target.''   ``President Bush should expect that the crimes the United Statesof America is committing against the Arab nation and the insult itis directing to the Islamic shrines by occupying holy lands willundoubtedly produce a natural reaction from the Arab and Islamicmasses,'' said the memorandum.   INA said the U.S. claims were contained in a note deliveredWednesday to the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad.   In Washington, State Department officials said U.S. diplomats inBaghdad told Iraqi authorities Wednesday night that the UnitedStates would hold them accountable for any terrorist attacks onAmericans.   A U.S. official said American intelligence has indicationsterrorist groups based in Iraq have begun planning for possibleactions against various targets - not only American, but also ofallied Arab countries.   All U.S. intelligence gathering posts are ``on a high state ofalert,'' the official said. All the U.S. officials spoke oncondition of anonymity.   In the past, U.S. officials have noted that two Palestinianleaders linked to terrorist acts - George Habash and Mohammed Abbas- have their headquarters in Baghdad.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew to Damascus onThursday to try to reinforce U.S. cooperation with Syria againstIraq, its longtime enemy.   Meanwhile, more than 300 Moslem religious scholars and preachersfrom the Saudi-funded Moslem World League issued a declarationafter a meeting that ended Wednesday. They condemned Saddam'sannexation of Kuweit as ``un-Islamic.''   The ``Mecca Declaration'' said the invasion of Kuwait and themassing of Iraqi troops on Saudi borders ``are enough Islamicreason'' to justify the presence of non-Moslem forces for SaudiArabia's defense.   ``Moslems should not attack or commit any felonies against eachother,'' the declaration said. ``Within these rulings, Iraq'sinvasion and occupation of Kuwait is against the principles ofIslam.''   Saddam last month attacked the Saudi monarchs for inviting inthe Americans, saying their presence sullied the holy sites ofMecca and Medina. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader,echoed Saddam's statement on Wednesday in a further sign Iran andIraq may be entering an alliance of convenience following theireight-year war, which ended in 1988.   Oil experts said Thursday that Iran's reported food-for-oil dealwith Iraq could allow Tehran to earn nearly $2 billion more a yearby eliminating its other oil imports and boosting exports. Sourceshave said Iran agreed to send food and medicine to Baghdad inexchange for 200,000 barrels of oil per day.   Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based newsletterPetrostrategies, said Iran ``probably could supply enough food tothe right people and places to keep the Iraqi economy going'' forawhile.   Iran's oil refineries were damaged during the war, so theIranians have been importing 150,000 barrels a day, paid for inscarce foreign currency.   Kayhan International, a Tehran newspaper, said Thursday thatrecently improved ties would allow the two countries to ``safeguardthe area's tranquility, and also prevent the influence anddomination of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf.''   The Tehran Times, which reflects government thinking, onWednesday denied Tehran had agreed to provide food and medicine toIran. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the UnitedStates believes Iran will uphold the U.N.-imposed embargo of Iraq.   Ambassador Marjatta Rasi of Finland, head of the U.N. SecurityCouncil sanctions committee, said Iraq already was feeling thepinch from the trade embargo. She said Iraq had ``plenty offoodstuffs'' stockpiled but was withholding food from foreigners.   The U.N. Security Council vote sought to maintain the narrowcircumstances under which aid could be sent, in line with aresolution passed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But Cuba,Yemen and some non-aligned nations insist food should be allowed inunder much broader circumstances.   Differences also have surfaced between the United States and itsallies over how to pay for the troop deployments in the region andrelated costs - such as feeding refugees and reimbursing countrieswhose economies suffer as a result of the embargo of Iraq.   Earlier Thursday, Japan's government rejected plans by the U.S.House of Representatives to link support for U.S. troops in Japanto Tokyo's contribution to the Mideast peace effort.   The House voted Wednesday to demand Japan pay for the 50,000U.S. troops stationed on its soil under a security treaty. TheUnited States currently pays three-fifths of the $7.4 billionannual bill.   ``We have been doing our best for the effective implementationof the Japan-U.S. security treaty, and we will continue to do so inthe future,'' Sakamoto said in a Tokyo news conference. ``But quitelogically, they are two separate matters.''   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also has been criticizedin Congress for not helping the U.S. effort enough, promisedThursday to lend ``a helping hand,'' though he did not whether theGermans would provide money.   In an interview at U.S. forces headquarters in Riyadh, commanderGeneral H. Norman Schwarzkopf said the infusion of armored unitsthe next two months will provide a ``100 percent chance'' ofwinning any battle with Iraqi forces.   However, he said he was confident his forces would stop an Iraqiattack now, despite logistical problems that have put thedeployment eight days behind.</TEXT></DOC>
