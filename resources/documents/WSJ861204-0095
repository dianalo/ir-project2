Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) and, allowing for hyperbole, the words went to the nub of the scandal that has shaken the Reagan presidency. If you want to understand the Amazing Comics capers involving the NSC, Iran, Israel, the contras and a potential cast of thousands, look no further. And if Congress wants them to recur in the not-distant future, all it has to do is fail to change fundamentally the rules that govern the NSC staff and director.    But if the NSC's private foreign policy (or at least, seemingly private) can best be explained by allusions to loose cannons, there is a deeper explanation for why those who played fast and loose with their power acted as they did. It was foreshadowed by something Hugh Sloan, treasurer of the Nixon reelection committee in 1972, said before he resigned. He described the atmosphere in the Nixon administration during Watergate by saying: &quot;There was no independent sense of morality there. I mean, if you worked for someone, he was God and whatever the orders were, you did it -- and there were damned few who were able or willing to make independent judgments. . . . It was all so narrow, so closed. . . . There emerged some kind of separate morality about things.&quot;    It is that &quot;separate morality&quot; we have been smelling around Washington for six years. The ideological truth, as promulgated by a president whose &quot;truths&quot; are rarely disturbed by facts, has been used to justify almost anything. For the true believers who were placed in positions of influence and power, their mission was so holy that nothing should be allowed to stand in its way -- not laws, not public opinion, not court orders and not Congress.    Did everyone else, and all previous presidents, understand the clear demands of court rulings and legislative acts in the field of civil rights? Too bad. It was time to subvert them. Did the courts demand certain behavior in the distribution of disability benefits? Ignore the courts. Did everyone involved with the negotiation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty say that it was clearly meant to forbid certain forms of development and deployment? Simply contradict them and violate the treaty as you see fit. Did Congress intend that the Superfund be implemented with evenhanded firmness? To hell with Congress.    A &quot;separate morality about things&quot;: Thus Lt. Col. Oliver North, the man held out to us as the sole architect of the Iran-contra connection, is explained by his former associate, Michael Ledeen, as one who did nothing &quot;that didn't reflect the convictions of his superiors.&quot; As for Congress, its laws and the media, the colonel is repeatedly described as holding them all in contempt. On the one side, revealed truth; on the other, the checks and balances of a democratic republic of divided authority.    In this administration, Lt. Col. North is no exception. Even as he was revealing the evidence of diversion of funds to the contras, Attorney General Edwin Meese was demanding unswerving loyalty from the president's team. In Washington today, no trespass of legal responsibility is considered an adequate ground for resignation or sustained opposition. Secretary of State George Shultz went out and played the good soldier, if not the good German. &quot;I think the president has been giving magnificent leadership. . . . I am proud to be a part of the president's efforts in this regard.&quot;    Finally, there was White House counsel Peter J. Wallison. Asked by the New York Times whether the administration upheld the laws it disliked or simply ignored them, he replied: &quot;I'm not going to be able to say anything. I just have no comment on that.&quot; There, at least, honesty compelled silence.    &quot;There is a bitter bile in my throat,&quot; the president told his sycophantic Time magazine interviewer, Hugh Sidey. In his throat? Surely he was jesting, or attempting to describe the way millions of his once-loyal public now feel. This from the president who had once proclaimed that &quot;America will never make concessions to terrorists,&quot; and then made them. This from a president who was forced to fire Lt. Col. North, and who then hailed him as a &quot;national hero.&quot; What would he have called Gordon Liddy of Watergate?    It is now up to Congress, the special prosecutor and the press to probe deeply into the question of how wide the net of complicity and blame should be cast. More than one of our contemporary Holy Crusaders will have to face the consequences of forgetting that ours is supposed to be a government of laws and not men.    But the law itself must be changed so that the National Security Council structure is no longer such a convenient spot to lodge activities forbidden by law or public policy. All operations must be explicitly forbidden to the NSC staff and director, with appropriate criminal penalties for violations. If the NSC director is not to be made subject to confirmation, as the Senate would have required seven years ago, then he must be forcefully confined to the role of adviser and traffic cop. Otherwise, sooner rather than later other men will be found who are willing to play by the rules of a &quot;separate morality,&quot; and yet another administration will be shaken to its foundations and the country with it. </TEXT></DOC>
