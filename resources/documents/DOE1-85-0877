In particular,the energy storage efficiency is determined from the measured gain ofweak signals and output of the stored energy in the amplification circuitsunder conditions of single- and double-pass amplification; the experimentalresults are then compared with the calculated values. The active elementsused in the study include neodymium and phosphate glasses. It is shownthat, by reducing absorption to a level below 0.001/cm, it would be possibleto increase the energy output efficiency by at least a factor of 1.5and create lasers with an efficiency of greater than 2 percent. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
