So they shouldn't be surprised that the Street isn't taking their latest investment too seriously.    The two principals of Abelow Ihasz andamp; Co., a New York arbitrage concern, last week made their first 13D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, after acquiring 7.1% of Zenith Electronics. Their stated goal: &quot;to encourage management to enhance shareholder values.&quot;    The basic plan is to force Zenith management to sell its struggling consumer electronics unit and focus all its resources on its fast-growing computer business. Many on Wall Street think the consumer electronics unit will in fact be shed.    But they are growing wary of the stock, which has jumped about 60% since early March. They think the shares may be about as enhanced as they are going to get.    This stock is &quot;only for players, not investors, at this point,&quot; says Mark Hassenberg, a vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. He advises investors to hold the shares or use them as &quot;a source of funds&quot; -- that is, sell some.    Takeover-stock speculators aren't flocking to support Messrs. Abelow and Ihasz either. &quot;These guys don't have the staying power,&quot; says one arbitrager. &quot;I don't think they can make anything happen.&quot;    Another arbitrager at a major Wall Street firm is even more blunt. &quot;I don't think you can scare the Street into buying stock,&quot; he contends. Zenith shares closed Friday at 28 3/4, off 1/4 on the day and just 3/8 above their level last week prior to the SEC filing.    The wild card in all this chatter, analysts and arbitragers concede, is the item in the filing that lists six limited partners and one &quot;special limited partner&quot; as part of an investor group. Clearly, they say, Messrs. Abelow and Ihasz didn't put up the entire $27.3 million to buy the stake.    So Wall Street is scrambling to unearth the names of the other partners. The guesses include such deep-pocketed entities as the Basses of Texas, and Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg, the Wall Street firm embroiled in a proxy fight with Allegheny International. Spear Leeds won't comment on the rumor. A spokesman for the Basses denies they are involved in the Zenith investment.    Mr. Abelow, former head of proprietary trading at First Boston, formed Abelow Ihasz in 1982 after linking up with Mr. Ihasz, who was Ivan Boesky's former head trader and a general partner of the arbitrage firm Lafer Amster. Several arbitragers say Abelow Ihasz has struggled in the past two years, including taking a pounding Oct. 19. Mr. Abelow counters that &quot;it appears that in most cases we've done as well as most arbs have done.&quot;    Mr. Abelow says that after studying Zenith, &quot;we saw there were potential ways to unlock the company's values&quot; and started buying shares in early March at about $17 a share. Since then, Zenith's biggest union has said the company is interested in selling its consumer electronics unit and that the union would be interested in bidding for it.    Analysts and others estimate that Zenith could sell the unit for about $500 million, or about $20 a share, if it can find a foreign electronics maker looking to merge the Zenith unit with its own television operations. Zenith won't comment on the possibility of the unit's sale or the group's stake. Zenith is the one remaining U.S.-based maker of televisions.    Sale of the electronics unit would allow the company to focus on its $1.2 billion computer unit, one of the industry leaders in laptop computers. The unit is considered so technologically advanced that Compaq Computer and International Business Machines recently postponed the unveiling of new laptop models after Zenith showed its new products this spring, says Michael Goulde, a director of CAP International, a Norwell, Mass., market research and consulting firm.    Zenith thinks its laptops are about a year ahead of the competition's, though some people expect IBM and Compaq to introduce rival products later this year. But Zenith has focused on military and education markets, which have skimpier margins than other areas; it also has a PC clone business.    Zenith's operating profit margins are about 9% in the computer unit, compared with about 20% for Compaq, analysts say. They value the computer business at about $20 to $30 a share. But Zenith also has more than $400 million in debt, equal to about $17 a share.    Analysts expect the company to earn 85 cents to $1 a share this year, compared with a 1987 loss. Zenith could get a major boost if it wins part of a $4.5 billion Air Force contract expected to be announced at year end, says Robert M. Johnson, an analyst at Rotan Mosle in Houston. He expects Zenith to bid with a partner on the contract, which could reap Zenith $1 billion in additional sales.    But for now, analysts struggle to value Zenith at more than, say, $33 a share.    ---   Zenith Electronics   (NYSE; Symbol: ZE)   Business: Computer Consumer Electronics.
