You know us Episcopalians,&quot; Bush said, pausing as a ripple oflaughter spread across the audience. &quot;And like a lot of people, I've worried alittle bit about shedding tears in public or the emotion of it.&quot;;    With theBaptists in the World Congress Center listening intently, the presidentcontinued his account of the private prayer session he and first lady BarbaraBush held at the presidential retreat in northern Maryland, just before thestart of the Persian Gulf war Jan. 17:;    A prayer before war;  &quot;As Barbaraand I prayed at Camp David before the air war began, we were thinking aboutthose young men and women overseas. And I had the tears start down the cheeks,and our minister smiled back.&quot;;    As his voice broke up, he paused for amoment, caught his breath and then resumed his confession of sorts. &quot;I, I nolonger worried how it looked to others,&quot; he said.;    At that, he brushed hischeek. As the audience applauded, he blurted out in an acknowledgment that hewas weeping again: &quot;There we go. . . .&quot;;    Catching himself, he went on:;   &quot;I think that, like a lot of others who had positions of responsibility insending someone else's kids to war, we realize that in prayer what mattered ishow it might have seemed to God.&quot;;    The Southern Baptist Convention provideda friendly audience as Bush ran through his agenda on social and domesticissues. He called for speedy passage of his anti-crime legislation and --raising briefly a subject he has only rarely mentioned in public appearanceslately -- he restated his opposition to federal funding of abortions, exceptin cases where the procedure is needed to save a woman's life.;    He alsocalled on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment that would reverse aSupreme Court ruling and permit voluntary prayer in schools.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Atlanta  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910607  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  481  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 7, 199100159158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
