(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three former Du Pont Co. employees whowon a $75 million personal injury award say they hope to give $67.5million to six institutions to help others who suffer from exposureto asbestos.   ``We are making these donations as our best effort to try tohelp our fellow asbestos victims, as well as to help assure thatthis kind of abuse of public trust will never happen again,''William Kapp Jr., 55, one of the victims and spokesman for thegroup, said Monday.   Kapp of Elkton, Md.; James Webb, 74, of Newport; and JosephKaster, 71, of the Newport area said the money would be donated ifthe damage award is upheld on appeal.   In November, a Superior Court jury ordered Raymark IndustriesInc. of Trumbull, Conn., to pay the men and their wives punitivedamages for conspiring to hide the health hazards of asbestos.   Judge Clarence W. Taylor has yet to decide whether to uphold theaward. If it is upheld, Raymark plans to appeal, according toLeGrande L. Young, Raymark general counsel.   Even if it is upheld, Kapp said he realizes the award may neverbe paid for several reasons, including the fact there are still 350asbestos-related cases pending against Raymark in Delaware, andlast week a mistrial was declared in a trial in which Raymark wasordered to pay $22 million to two other former Du Pont employees.   If Taylor upholds the $75 million, Kapp said it could forceRaymark into bankruptcy.   ``This way, someone will get something. We're not trying to hogit all. If we force them into (bankruptcy), it will at least go tocharity,'' Kapp said.   ``On the question of bankruptcy, that's a possibility,'' Youngsaid.   Raymark does not have $75 million, but does have more than thatin insurance, he said.   The National Campaign Against Toxic Hazards, a toxic victimsadvocacy group based in Boston, was earmarked for $13 million ofthe award.   Other institutions to receive $13 million each would be theMount Sinai School of Environmental Medicine in New York; theUniversity of Delaware School of Business; the Medical Center ofDelaware's Carpenter Clinic for Cancer Research; and theBaltimore-based White Lung Association for asbestos victims.   The Emily P. Bissell Hospital for the critically ill in Newportwas earmarked for $2.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
