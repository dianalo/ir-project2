(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 73-year-old man, apparently stuck in atrash can on his front porch since Monday, waved to visitors who``let it pass'' and eventually died of a heart attack, authoritiessaid Thursday.   Robert Hamm was wedged up to his armpits, his lower legs stickingout of the standard, galvanized trash can when he was foundWednesday by the mother of a newspaper carrier, who first saw theold man sitting in the can Monday.   ``It was a natural death, something that could have happened anytime,'' said a Monroe County medical examiner's spokesman, who saidit was policy not to identify himself. ``It could have happenedwhile he was sleeping in bed.''   Hamm, who lived alone, waved to the newspaper carrier and to amail carrier while in the can earlier this week, but may have beentoo weak to alert them that he was stuck, police said. They refusedto identify the carriers.   ``I would imagine he was probably trying to signal something, buthis expression or whatever wasn't enough to get them to do anythingabout it,'' said Sgt. R.J. Liepins. ``They all feel very bad.''   Liepins said it appeared that Hamm, described as being of mediumheight and build, had fallen backward into the can on his enclosedfront porch and couldn't get out.   Police said Thursday they did not suspect foul play in the deathand had no way of verifying whether he actually was stuck on theporch three days. Hamm's house was apparently intact and itscontents undisturbed, officers said.   The 11-year-old newspaper carrier told police she waved at Hammand said hello from outside the porch while delivering the newspaperabout 4 p.m. Monday. She said he waved back and mumbled something,police said.   On Tuesday, the mail carrier, whose name was unavailable, alsosaw him in the can from outside the porch and saw his hand move,Liepins said. ``He thought something was funny ... but he just letit pass,'' Liepins said.   The newspaper carrier told her mother on Monday and again onTuesday, but the woman didn't go to Hamm's house until Wednesdaybecause she didn't think anything was seriously wrong.   ``He was kind of eccentric and we didn't think anything aboutit,'' police quoted her as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
