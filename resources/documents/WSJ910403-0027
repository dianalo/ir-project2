The explosion of the Titan IV engine booster in its firsttest firing raises serious doubts about Hercules' engineproject, securities analysts said. At best, it delays theengine program by several months. At worst, it could lead tothe entire four-year-old project being scrapped, analystsspeculated.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the broad advance in stock prices yesterdayHercules shares plunged $5.25 to close at $36 on volume of2.9 million shares. Initially, the stock fell $7.25 to $34,or more than 17%, after a delayed opening caused by a floodof sell orders. More than 1% of the shares outstandingchanged hands at that price, the day's low, in a single blockof 500,000 shares.   &quot;Obviously, it's a set back for the company,&quot; said GeorgeKrug, a securities analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in NewYork. Robert Hessler, a spokesman for the Wilmington, Del.,company, said it was &quot;impossible to speculate&quot; what impactthe explosion will have on Hercules' contract to develop andproduce the rocket booster.   Shares of Martin Marietta Corp., the major contractor forthe Titan IV project, slid $1.625 to $54.875.   There were no injuries in the explosion, which the AirForce said it has appointed a panel to investigate.   Some investors may have recently accumulated Herculesstock as a bet on a successful test of the engine booster.Several analysts sent out optimistic reports on the companyafter company Chairman Thomas Gossage, according to oneanalyst, said recently that he was &quot;optimistic, but notoverly confident&quot; about the test.   One analyst warned in February that a failed engine test&quot;could be devastating for the Titan program and Hercules'role in it.&quot; But he added, &quot;risk-oriented investors may wishto be aggressive in accumulating the stock since a normalTitan test would likely propel the stock to new heights.&quot;   The explosion is also the latest setback for the U.S.space program. The solid fuel engine is designed to boost by25% the payload unmanned rockets can carry into earth orbitto accommodate the Air Force's need for heavier, moresophisticated spy satellites. The Air Force had hoped tolaunch a satellite using the booster next year.   The explosion at Edwards Air Force Base in SouthernCalifornia occurred at 4:17 p.m. EST, shortly after the closeof trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. A firingstand used in the test was also heavily damaged by theexplosion.   The test was to be the first of five. Due to the damage tothe firing stand, it is likely to be many months beforeanother test can take place, the Hercules spokesman said.   Charles Gunn, the National Aeronautic and SpaceAdministration's director of unmanned launch vehicles, saidhe didn't believe that the Titan IV problems would affect thespace agency because NASA doesn't plan to use the rocketuntil the end of 1995. He estimates that the Air Force willhave launched a dozen Titan IVs with the upgraded booster bythat time and corrected the problems.   Hercules' aerospace unit took $323 million in write-offsin 1989, more than $200 million of which were directlyattributable to the Titan IV engine. The unit continued tostumble last year, when it &quot;experienced technical andoperational setbacks,&quot; according to the 1990 annual report.</TEXT></DOC>
