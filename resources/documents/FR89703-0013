The purpose of amending 7 CFR Part 1762 is toannounce a general revision of REA Contract Form 515, Telephone SystemConstruction Contract, Labor and Materials. The Contract Form 515 associatedspecifications are: REA Forms 515a, REA Specifications and Drawings forConstruction of Direct Buried Plant (REA Bulletin 345-150); 515c, REA Specificationsand Drawings for Conduit and Manhole Construction (REA Bulletin 345-151);515d, REA Specifications and Drawings for Underground Cable Installation(REA Bulletin 345-152); 515f, REA Specifications and Drawings for Constructionof Pole Lines and Aerial Cables (REA Bulletin 345-153); and 515g, REA Specificationsand Drawings for Service Entrance and Station Protector Installation (REABulletin 345-154). These associated specifications are listed in 7 CFRPart 1772.REA Contract Form 515 and its associated specifications were last revisedin September 1979. Since that date, the telephone industry, constructionmaterials, engineering designs and procedures, testing requirements, andconstruction methods have all changed significantly. The 515 forms needrevision to incorporate these changes into the outside plant contract andspecifications. The main changes to the contract proposed are the additionof new construction units for (1) buried filled fiber optic cable, (2)aerial filled fiber optic cable, (3) aerial filled cable, (4) fiber opticsplicing, (5) network interface devices, (6) handholes, (7) undergroundfiber optic cable, and (8) insurance and bonding requirements. Proposedchanges in the specifications will be covered in individual <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notices referenced to their respective REA bulletinlisted in 7 CFR Part 1772. This action will make it possible for REA telephoneborrowers to continue to provide their subscribers with the most modernand efficient telephone service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Public comments must be received by REA no later than September1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments to William F.

The DraftImpact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this proposedrule is available on request from the above mentioned individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,or productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, this rule has been determined to be ``not major.''This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 et seq. (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985), thisprogram is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.The proposed rule does not contain new or amended information collectionrequirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 as amended.Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under clearance number 0572-0062.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>REA has issued a series of 7 CFR Chapter XVII Parts which serve to implementthe policies, procedures, and requirements for administering its loan andloan guarantee programs and the security instruments which provide forand secure REA financing. The purpose of the proposed revision to 7 CFRPart 1762 is to announce revisions of the Telephone System ConstructionContract, Labor and Materials, REA Form 515. Revisions to 7 CFR Part 1772will be published to revise the contract's associated specifications: REAForm 515a, covering the construction of direct buried plant; REA Form 515c,setting forth requirements for conduit and manhole construction; REA Form515d, the specifications and drawings for underground cable installations;REA Form 515f, the specifications and drawings for construction of polelines and aerial cable; and REA Form 515g, the specifications and drawingsfor service entrance and station protector installation. The 7 CFR Part1762 also provides information as to where copies of the contract may beobtained and the price per copy, where applicable. REA Form 515 is a laborand materials contract wherein the contractor furnishes all labor and materialsrequired for the construction of telephone outside plant facilities. REAtelephone borrowers are required to use the Form 515 contract where majoroutside plant facilities are being constructed by the contract method.Since the current contract was issued in 1979, new construction materials,such as fiber optic cable, filled aerial cable, and network interface devices,have been introduced. These new materials require new construction andinstallation specifications. There are also changes that have been madein testing and grounding requirements and construction techniques. Allthese proposed additions and changes need to be made so that REA telephoneborrowers can continue to provide their subscribers with the most up-to-dateand efficient telephone service.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1762</ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.In view of the above, REA is proposing to amend 7 CFR Part 1762 by issuingrevised Form 515.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1762_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
