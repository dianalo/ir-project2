Appointed by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, a ``tiger team''of government and outside experts found significant health, safetyand environmental deficiencies at the World War II-era plantoutside Amarillo.   In a memo accompanying the team's draft report, Watkins said thefindings indicate workers lack adequate protection from emergencyand routine exposures to radioactive releases. He said thesituation must be corrected immediately.   While the team said it found no conditions that appeared ``topose a clear and present danger to safety and health ... it wasclear the radiation safety department would be unable to respondeffectively to emergencies involving a release of radioactivematerial.''   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said some problems already had beencorrected and others were being addressed by plant officials.   In its report released Wednesday, the team said the radiationprotection program was generally inadequate ``as evidenced byextensive non-compliance'' with Energy Department regulations.   The plant's contractor, and DOE offices in Amarillo andAlbuquerque, N.M., have been aware of the situation for severalyears ``but little has been achieved to correct it,'' the reportsaid.   Although Watkins said the plant has a strong ``safety culture... little evidence exists that a comparable environmental cultureis evolving. This must be corrected.''   The report said Pantex is not adequately monitoring its impacton the underlying Ogallala aquifer, practically the only source ofuseable water for Texas' largest irrigated farming region.   As of August, 11 of the plant's 29 underground storage tanksystems had been leak-tested and five were either leaking or hadleaking pipes. Those systems have been replaced and testingcontinues on the remaining systems.   ``If the failure rate continues to be as high as in the first 11tank systems tested, there could be substantive on-going releasesto the subsurface environment,'' the report said.   The plant's procedures for assessing possible contamination ofthe air, soil and ground water also do not meet industry standardsand the plant does not have an environmental monitoring plan, saidthe team, which was at Pantex from Oct. 2-31.   Pantex also has failed to ask the Environmental ProtectionAgency whether it needs a permit for discharges of contaminated andpotentially contaminated waste water runoff into several playas _ephemeral desert lakes _ on the grounds of the 16,000-acre plant.   Samples collected in ditches leading to three of those playasand in two playas show heavy metal and organic contamination inwater and sediments, the report said.   Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigators sentto the plant found more than 300 violations, dozens of them serious.   In one health violation, records were not maintained on anemployee's exposure to radioactive material during a weaponteardown operation, or for employees involved in the cleanup.   Watkins has ordered DOE officials and the plant's contractor,Mason andamp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co., to address all deficiencies in afinal plan due in February. A formal OSHA report is expected bymid-January.   The plant assembles, maintains and repairs nuclear weapons andmanufactures high explosive components.</TEXT></DOC>
