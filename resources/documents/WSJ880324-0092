The company's four-year-old legal donnybrook with Pennzoil Co. officially ended yesterday when Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg approved a reorganization plan that will spring the oil giant from its Chapter 11 proceedings on April 7.    But while Texaco officials acted as if they had been suddenly cured of a terminal disease, it was clear that the company's executives still face major struggles. Despite recent improvements in its exploration program, Texaco remains with fewer oil reserves than ever. It must shed assets into a buyer's market to pay off the mountain of debt it has lately accumulated. And it emerges from bankruptcy-law protection with its largest shareholder -- New York raider Carl C. Icahn, who owns 14.8% of its stock -- decidedly unhappy.    Wall Street sources said Mr. Icahn still expects to launch a proxy fight for control of five board seats at Texaco's annual meeting, tentatively scheduled for May 10. Mr. Icahn wouldn't comment on his plans for the meeting.    In an interview, the investor did say that he was happy that the proceedings were finally over -- and that he had played some role in their resolution. But he was dismayed that the company's reorganization plan will release Texaco's directors and officers from any past and future liability for their role in Texaco's $11 billion litigation with Pennzoil.    Even though he and other Texaco holders approved the reorganization plan by a 96% margin, he said, &quot;I'm sorry shareholders weren't allowed to decide on the releases separately, but (were) forced to give the releases to get the bankruptcy settled.&quot;    Texaco may be forced to deal with Mr. Icahn again in court if he appeals Judge Schwartzberg's approval of the legal releases to a federal court, as his attorney has said he would.    While Texaco officials expressed relief, they showed little jubilation at the conclusion of yesterday's proceedings. &quot;I'm just glad this long litigation is finally over,&quot; said James W. Kinnear, chief executive officer of Texaco, as he shook the hands of his many attorneys.    He did not, however, clasp the hand or acknowledge in any way the presence of J. Hugh Liedtke, who, as chairman of Houston-based Pennzoil, has spent the past two years trying to collect as much as possible of Pennzoil's record-setting court judgment against Texaco.    &quot;This hasn't been a particularly pleasant experience,&quot; Mr. Liedtke said of the bitter fight with Texaco. &quot;But it had to be done.&quot;    Although the $3 billion payment represents roughly three times Pennzoil's current net worth, Mr. Liedtke appeared ready to handle the sum adroitly. The company has arranged for Chemical Bank, on behalf of Texaco, to wire the money into a Pennzoil account at the Texas Commerce Bank, Houston, which has a long relationship with Texaco and happens to be a subsidiary of Chemical.    Although Pennzoil won't receive the funds until April 7 -- Texaco's plan is effective 15 days from yesterday -- Mr. Liedtke said he intends to begin borrowing a substantial part of the $3 billion from a group of banks during the next few days so he can begin investing the money in liquid, short-term instruments, such as Treasury bills and certificates of deposit, over a period of about 10 days.    This, he and another Pennzoil official explained, will save the company from having to invest $3 billion in one fell swoop, which could skew the short-term money markets and cost Pennzoil a few basis points of yield. The alternative would be investing the $3 billion piecemeal after the money had been received, leaving some of the money temporarily idle. At a yield of 8%, for instance, $3 billion earns $650,000 a day.    Mr. Liedtke said it could be several months before he decides what to do with the money, though $400 million in legal fees is already spoken for -- and much of that, if not most, by a single individual. Joe Jamail, the Houston personal-injury lawyer who won the mammoth judgment for Pennzoil in 1985, handled the case on a contingency-fee basis and is in line to receive a fee that neither he nor Pennzoil will specify, but one that will surely rank as the biggest legal bill ever presented. &quot;But,&quot; Mr. Liedtke quipped, &quot;I won't pay the lawyers for as long as possible. I'm sure Joe will be patient.&quot;    Also unknown -- to Pennzoil or to anyone else -- is how the Internal Revenue Service will treat Pennzoil's windfall. The company is investigating ways to try to shelter all or much of it from taxation, but isn't certain of the outcome.    As for whatever amount remains, Mr. Liedtke all but ruled out a special dividend to shareholders. Acquisitions, however, are a probability. &quot;I don't know how you can invest $3 billion without buying something,&quot; he chuckled. A variety of oil companies bigger than Pennzoil have been viewed as acquisition targets.    Despite his pleasure at receiving history's biggest legal payment -- indeed, a sum many times larger than the biggest verdict ever upheld -- Mr. Liedtke asserted that even $3 billion didn't &quot;made the company whole,&quot; referring to Texaco's interference with Pennzoil's acquisition of part of Getty Oil Co. Pennzoil was awarded $10.3 billion by a Texas court as a result, and the two companies settled the dispute in December when Texaco said it would pay Pennzoil $3 billion.    &quot;The loss of that particular transaction is irreplaceable and hurtful,&quot; he said, forcing both Texaco and Pennzoil to a standstill for four years, Mr. Liedtke said. &quot;We missed many corporate opportunities by being in a holding pattern.&quot;    Notwithstanding the 15-day waiting period, Judge Schwartzberg's action brought to an end one of the most contentious chapters in U.S. corporate history -- a saga that has engaged at least 350 lawyers and 31 judges and that has consumed well over $100 million in fees, not counting whatever Mr. Jamail receives.    In a statement from the bench, Judge Schwartzberg recalled that it was on a Sunday morning not quite a year ago when &quot;Texaco attorneys, who had been up all night, showed up at my door in wrinkled suits and with piles of papers and thus commenced the largest bankruptcy case in history.&quot; Poising his pen over his confirmation order he added, &quot;Now I will approve this plan.&quot;    Texaco wants desperately to turn its attention away from the courts and back to the oil business. &quot;We're going to put together one of the most exciting restructurings the industry has ever seen,&quot; Mr. Kinnear told several spectators in the courtroom after the proceedings ended.    Texaco has said in the past that it intends to sell at least $3 billion in assets as part of a restructuring that will streamline the company and raise cash to pay off debt. Some of the sales will be outright, while others will involve the creation of joint ventures.    As previously reported, Texaco is negotiating the sale of half of its East Coast and Gulf Coast refining and marketing operations with Saudi Arabia. It is also completing negotiations on the sale of Deutsche Texaco A.G. to a West German company. Neither Mr. Kinnear nor Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane Jr., who was also in the courtroom, elaborated about Texaco's future other than to say that a decision hasn't yet been made on whether to sell the company's 78% stake in Texaco Canada.    However, in a statement released later, Mr. Kinnear said he was &quot;committed to becoming bolder and more aggressive in pursuing opportunities to increase earnings and cash flow,&quot; and that Texaco &quot;will begin the acceleration&quot; of its restructuring.    If management gets the time to pursue its restructuring -- and is successful in completing it -- Texaco should be a vastly different company by the end of the year. There will be a greater focus on its oil producing operations and less reliance on its refining and marketing business. Such a reshaping would be a complete turnaround for a company that once touted itself as the nation's premier marketer of oil products -- the only oil company ever to have service stations in all 50 states.    ---        Pennzoil v.
