Such courseswere generally well received throughout the 1970's and enrollments continuedto remain high throughout this period. The 1980's, however, have seenconsiderable change. Most students now entering university have beensubjected to more than a decade of exposure to the subject of energyat school, on television, and in magazines and newspapers. There is agreat need in this discussion to be critically objective, pointing discussingthe potential contribution of each resource to the total energy supply.Proposed energy courses for the 1980's, in this book, probably don'tlook that different from those in the 1970's. The difference must bein the emphasis, on stressing the complexity of the situation and onstressing the need for an energy future that involves the reliance onmany energy supply methods.</TEXT></DOC>
