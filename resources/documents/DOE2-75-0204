An important factor underlying thistrend is the shift in the structure of economic production away fromenergy-intensive sectors. This paper focuses on studies conducted inboth countries to measure the relative importance of shifts within theeconomy on energy demand. A significant achievement in this collaborationis the use of the same methodology for analyzing this issue. This meansthat differences in the results between countries will be reflectingprimarily differences in energy use trends rather than differences inmethodology. Both historical and projected trends for the two countriesare examined. 12 refs., 12 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
