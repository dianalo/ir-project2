Introduction </ITAG>A. Test Rule Development Under TSCA This final rule is part of the overall implementation of section 4 TSCA(Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq.</T3>, 15 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which contains authority for EPA to require the developmentof data relevant to assessing the risk to health and the environment posedby exposure to particular chemical substances or mixtures (chemicals).Under section 4(a)(1) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical todevelop health or environmental data if the Administrator makes certainfindings as described in TSCA under section 4(a)(1) (A) or (B).Detailed discussions of the statutory section 4 findings are provided inthe Agency's first and second proposed test rules, which were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300).B. Regulatory History The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) designated MBT for priority testingconsideration in its 15th Report, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 29, 1984 (49 FR 46931). The ITC recommendedthat MBT be considered for chemical fate testing, including dissociationconstant, persistence in water and soil, and leaching and migration; andenvironmental effects testing, including acute and chronic toxicity tofish, aquatic invertebrates and plants, and terrestrial plants. EPA responded to the ITC's recommendations for MBT by issuing a proposedrule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 6, 1985 (50 FR 46121), which wouldrequire that MBT be tested for oral and dermal pharmacokinetics, developmentaltoxicity, reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, mutagenic effects (chromosomalaberrations), aerobic aquatic biodegradation, indirect photolysis screeninglevel test, chemical mobility, fish chronic toxicity, and daphnid chronictoxicity. The proposed rule contained a chemical profile of MBT, a discussion ofEPA's TSCA section 4(a) findings, and the proposed test standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Public Comments </ITAG>The Agency received written comments on the MBT proposed rule from theRubber Manufacturers Association (RMA), Dow Chemical Company, and the RubberAdditives Program Panel (RAPP) of the Chemical Manufacturers Association(CMA). A public meeting was also requested by CMA and held on April 14,1986. The comments received by the Agency in response to the MBT proposedrule are discussed below. A. Justification for the Substantial Exposure (Section 4(a)(1)(B)) Finding1. <T3>Production/use. </T3>RMA provided the Agency with comments and additionalinformation, including results of a survey, regarding exposure to and currentuse of MBT. The presented survey results indicate that consumption of MBTas a vulcanization accelerator is 850,000 pounds per year and that MBTis not typically used in high volume products such as tires, or in consumerproducts. Based on this survey, the RMA questioned ``* * * whether exposureto MBT is sufficiently widespread and substantial to support issuance ofa test rule.''The RAPP survey confirms EPA's findings that MBT is now used as an acceleratorprimarily in certain specialty products. However, the survey fails to indicatethat the major use of MBT is in the manufacture of several other rubberaccelerators, e.g., NaMBT, ZnMBT, 2,2-dithio-bisbenzothiazole (MBTS), <T3>N-tert-</T3>butyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (BBTS), <T3>N-</T3>cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (CBS), and <T3>N</T3>-oxydiethylene-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (OBTS) (Ref. 1). Thetotal amount of MBT consumed in production of these derivatives will greatlyexceed the amount of MBT the RMA indicates will be consumed in productionof specialty rubber products, or the 1983 sales volume of 5,958,000 pounds(Ref. 2). Considering the large volumes of MBT used widely in both chemicalmanufacture and as a specialty rubber accelerator, the Agency maintainsthat potential for substantial exposure to MBT may exist in the workplace,in consumer goods, and in receiving environments. Furthermore, the MBT-derivedrubber accelerators have a strong tendency to decompose in the vulcanizationprocedure and can form MBT (Ref. 3), which may carry over into end-productsand waste effluents. Also, introduction of the MBT salts into the environmentcan lead to the presence of MBT by simple hydrolysis. Thus, the Agencymaintains that when the total pattern of MBT usage is considered, sufficientpotential for substantial exposure to MBT exists to support testing requirementsunder section 4(a)(1)(B) of TSCA.2. <T3>Exposure data/monitoring.</T3> RAPP also maintained that its surveyof national surface waters (18 sites, predominantly in the middle and easternUnited States) shows that MBT is not a widespread aquatic contaminant becauseno MBT was detected at a stated limit of detection of 10 ppb.EPA continues to believe that this study was limited by several experimentaldeficiencies, such that meaningful interpretation of the results is difficult.The principal shortcoming of the study was the wide variation in recoveryof MBT from field-spiked samples. Compounding this analytical deficiencyis the choice of sampling locations, which generally were very large bodiesof water (such as the Great Lakes), far removed from sites that manufactureor process MBT. In addition, although some sample sites were in areas ofheavy industry (i.e., Mississippi River at Memphis, TN, and Alton, IL;Missouri River at St. Louis, MO; and eastern Lake Erie near Erie, PA),these sites had zero percent recoveries of MBT in field-spiked samples,suggesting that any MBT present in study samples would also have not beendetected by the procedures used. In contrast to the above data, that hasbeen detected in several sites associated with the production/processingof MBT (Refs. 26 through 28).3. <T3>Exposure data/tire dust. </T3>RAPP also commented that the Agency mayhave overestimated the release of MBT to the environment via leaching fromtire dust created by the wear of tires made with MBT. Among the reasonsgiven were: (1) MBT accounts for less than 10 percent of accelerator usedin tires; (2) most MBT is bound in the rubber matrix and leaches slowly,if at all, from tire dust contacting water; (3) current tire wear is muchlonger than when the original EPA estimate was made; and (4) ``* * * MBTis too unstable on the terrestrial soil to remain as MBT for long * * *.''While the Agency agrees that the EPA estimate of 12 million pounds of vulcanizationaccelerators (including MBT) released annually to the environment (primarilysoils near highways) via deposition of tire dust containing acceleratorsmay be an overestimate due to the greater life of current tires, the Agencymaintains that sufficient questions remain about the other reasons citedby RAPP that this scenario should remain as a cause for exposure concern.First, the original EPA estimate does not state that all tires are madewith MBT. The major use of MBT is in the manufacture of other rubber accelerators,which have a strong tendency to decompose in the vulcanization process,and can form MBT and carry over into end products and waste effluents,considerably broadening the scope of potential exposure (Ref. 1). Second,insufficient data exist to conclude that all MBT is tightly bound in therubber matrix. The study cited by the RAPP to demonstrate only a limitedleaching of MBT from tire rubber may actually suggest that MBT leachingcan be significant when consideration is given to the experimental design_asimple static water/tire system. In this system, a rapid equilibrium levelof MBT in the water was achieved. If the rubber had been exposed periodicallyto fresh aqueous media, much more MBT could potentially have been leachedfrom the rubber. Finally, there are no data from which to conclude thatMBT will not persist in roadside soils following deposition via tire dust.Furthermore, consideration must be given to the possibility that MBT enteringsoils by this mechanism may reach drainage systems via runoff and subsequentlyreach nearby surface waters.4. <T3>Exposure data/occupational and consumer. </T3>RAPP has indicated thatEPA lacks evidence of substantial worker exposure to MBT, citing the estimateof the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES; Ref. 4) of 2,398 exposedworkers, and the use of protective equipment and good hygiene to limitexposure, particularly because of the allergenic properties and disagreeableodor of MBT.While the Agency agrees that the warning properties of MBT encourage thelimitation of work exposure, EPA does not believe that a disagreeable odorand voluntary use of protective equipment will necessarily limit exposurein all occupational scenarios, nor does EPA consider the NOES estimateof 2,398 exposed workers to constitute an insubstantial number. Also, thisnumber may be an underestimate, because the NOES covered only those productscontaining the chemical name on the product label, not trade name productswhere substantial worker exposure could occur.RAPP also commented that MBT use in Spandex-containing clothing has beendiscontinued. EPA was aware of this at the time the proposed rule was issued(Ref. 1).5. <T3>Exposure data/chemical fate. </T3>RAPP commented that chemical fatetesting, particularly indirect photolysis, of MBT is unwarranted basedon lack of substantial environmental occurrence. EPA finds this conclusionto be unjustified, as discussed in Unit II.A.2. of this preamble, due tothe deficiencies of the RAPP monitoring study. Chemical fate and persistencedata for MBT is necessary to support an Agency risk assessment of MBT.B. Justification for Hazard Potential: Environmental EffectsRAPP maintains that by applying a 1,000-fold safety factor to acute toxicitydata, sufficient environmental effects data exist to predict that chronictoxicity to sensitive aquatic species to MBT at predicted environmentalconcentrations will not occur. RAPP notes that its environmental monitoringdata and ``worst case'' modeling indicate that environmental water concentrationswill not exceed 1 ppb, nearly three orders of magnitude less than the lowestdocumented acute effects level for fish (670 ppb). RAPP also noted thata previous EPA proposed rule for phenylenediamines (PDAs) allows use ofa 100-fold safety factor over predicted environmental concentration toassess the need for chronic effects testing, provided that acute effectsdata are available for at least three species (51 FR 472; January 6, 1986).The Agency considers the cited environmental monitoring data, however,to be inadequate as discussed in Unit II.A.2. of this preamble. The ``worstcase'' predicted concentration cited by RAPP of less than 1 ppb is basedon uniform dispersal of released MBT to all United States surface waters.In contrast, the Agency has estimated that MBT surface water concentrationsnear manufacturing sites could range from 2.96 to 385 ppb (Ref. 5), usingconfidential production and release data submitted by the manufacturers.Acute toxicity data are available for three fish species (Refs. 6 through8), an invertebrate (Refs. 9 and 10), and an alga (Refs. 11 and 12). Thetrout data were obtained under flow-through conditions, with the MBT concentrationsperiodically measured. All other studies adhered to standard static screeningprotocols, with no measurement of test material concentrations.With regard to the need for chronic toxicity testing, EPA, in the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) (51 FR 472; January 6, 1986) for PDA's, proposedthat fish early life stage tests or daphnid life-cycle tests (chronic toxicitytests) should be conducted if any LC50 or EC50 was less than or equal to100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). All of the MBTEC50 or LC50 values are less than 100 times the median or maximum PEC.The algal EC50 value is less than 100 times the minimum PEC. In the 2,6-di-<T3>tert</T3>-butyl phenol NPR (52 FR 23862, June 25, 1987), the Agencyproposed an additional decision criteria for determining whether chronictoxicity tests should be conducted, <T3>viz.,</T3> EC50 or LC50 less than 1 mg/L. The MBT 96-hr LC50 valuesfor rainbow trout are both less than 1 mg/L.In the tributyl phosphate NPR (52 FR 43346, November 12, 1987), the Agencyproposed that chronic toxicity tests should also be conducted if the ratioof the 24-hr to 96-hr LC50 (for 4-day acute tests) or the 24-hr to 48-hrLC50 (for 2-day acute tests) was greater than or equal to 2 and if theEC50 or LC50 was less than or equal to 150 mg/L. For MBT, the bluegill96-hr LC50 is less than 100 mg/L and the 24-hr to 96-hr LC50 ratio is greaterthan 2. Thus, MBT satisfies the criteria originally proposed as well asthose subsequently proposed for other chemical substances for conductingchronic toxicity tests. These decision criteria were proposed in the reproposedPDAs NPR (53 FR 913, January 14, 1988).C. Health Effects1. <T3>Need for testing/testing scheme.</T3> RAPP noted that the ITC in itsinitial review of MBT did not recommend health effects testing. It alsosuggested that it would be prudent to wait for the evaluation of the resultsof ongoing (pharmacokinetic) and completed (bioassay) tests prior to initiatingfurther health effects studies, and that any further testing considerednecessary should be conducted using a tiered approach. A tiered schemewas proposed by RAPP.In response to these comments, EPA notes that the report prepared by theITC was a preliminary assessment of the potential need for further testingof MBT. EPA's proposed requirements for health effects testing of MBT werea consequence of a tiered approach to evaluate the need for testing ofexisting chemicals. This does not imply any inconsistency with the ITCrecommendation but rather the evolution of a testing strategy as more informationhas become available. The Agency has considered the NTP chronic study inthe development of the test rule for MBT, and is not requiring furtherchronic and oncogenicity testing. The design of the particular chronicbioassay performed by NTP, however, is not adequate to answer all toxicologicalquestions of concern.2.<T3> Developmental toxicity testing.</T3> RAPP maintains that there isinsufficient evidence to justify the proposed requirement for testing MBTfor teratogenic potential in two species, because a study by Hardin etal. (Ref. 13) showed no indication that MBT was a teratogen when testedin rats by intraperitoneal injection at the maximum tolerated dose; itwas the conclusion of these authors that there was no need for furthertesting of MBT. In addition, RAPP is trying to locate a Japanese teratogenicitystudy. In consideration of the existing data, RAPP urges that the Agencylimit the developmental toxicity testing to only one species.As stated in the proposed rule (50 FR 46121), the Agency has reviewed severalteratology and reproduction studies (Refs. 13 through 17) and has foundthem to be inadequate to reasonably predict the developmental and reproductivetoxicity of MBT. Several of these studies were designed as screening studies;others were abstracted from Russian literature and details necessary fora thorough review were not available. The Hardin et al. study is of limitedvalue because it was designed as a screening study, and the group sizesused were too small. It has been a longstanding OTS policy to require testingin at least two mammalian species in order to <T3>adequately</T3> assess the potential developmental toxicity of an agent.For these reasons, EPA believes that existing data are insufficient forevaluating the teratogenic risk potential of MBT, and that testing in twospecies is necessary for the development of adequate data.3.<T3> Reproductive toxicity testing.</T3> RAPP states that the multigenerationreproductive study cannot be justified by the available data, and pointsout that, in the proposed test rule for cumene (50 FR 46104; November 6,1985), the Agency states that a multigeneration reproductive test willnot be required for cumene in the absence of evidence of reproductive organtoxicity in a subchronic test. RAPP has reviewed the 90-day subchronicstudy conducted for NTP (Ref. 18) and submitted in 1985 by Mobay ChemicalCorp. No evidence of significant lesions in any of the reproductive organsof rats or mice were reported in that study. RAPP suggests that the Agencypostpone a decision on a multigeneration study until after the resultsof the NTP 2-year chronic bioassay are reviewed and the results of therequired dominant lethal assay are available.When section 4 findings are based on the potential for substantial exposure,as for MBT, EPA requires testing for reproductive effects unless sufficientdata adequately describing reproductive effects are available. With regardto the NTP 90-day subchronic study referred to by RAPP, the type of 90-daysubchronic study conducted with MBT is not the same as that conducted withcumene. The subchronic study proposed by the Agency for cumene containedspecific requirements for extensive evaluation of the reproductive organsof both male and female animals. The subchronic study of MBT conductedfor NTP did not contain such an extensive evaluation of reproductive organssince the purpose of this study was to define the appropriate dose levelsfor a chronic bioassay. Furthermore, histopathology of the reproductiveorgans will not provide the needed information regarding the integrityof the functioning of the reproductive system. In cases of substantialexposure to an agent, as with MBT, EPA requires data both on morphologyand on physiology in the form of a two-generation reproductive effectsstudy. The design of a dominant lethal assay in which only male animalsare exposed and only for a relatively short period prior to mating doesnot provide enough information to adequately describe the effects on reproductionof long-term exposure to a compound. Furthermore, in a dominant lethalstudy only the male animal is exposed to the test agent and the end pointsthat are assessed are only a small fraction of what is needed to adequatelyevaluate the potential reproductive toxicity of an agent.4. <T3>Neurotoxicity testing.</T3> RAPP contends that there is no indicationthat MBT is a potential neurotoxic agent, and that this is supported bythe lack of any histologically observed nervous system damage in the NTPsubchronic study, and the lack of structural similarity between MBT andany known neurotoxic solvents. RAPP also believes that no laboratoriesin this country are available to perform the test, and that the lack ofexperience with this test would make assessing the results regarding humanhealth difficult. RAPP suggests that if neurotoxicity tests are required,the functional observational battery and neuropathology studies shouldbe conducted in sequence on the same animals.The NTP bioassay was designed to assess carcinogenicity, and not neurotoxicity.As stated in the proposed rule, no data on the neurotoxic effects of MBThave been found in the literature. Because EPA finds that there is a potentialfor substantial exposure to MBT, EPA is requiring that adequate neurotoxicitydata be developed. With regard to laboratories available to perform thetest, EPA points out that the required test protocol is in current usein the research community and on the C<T2>9</T2> aromatic hydrocarbon fraction (50 FR 20675; May 17, 1985), andthat industry has conducted such neurotoxicity studies on acrylamide. Inaddition, EPA has reviewed the availability of contract laboratory facilitiesto conduct the neurotoxicity testing requirements (Ref. 29) and believesthat facilities will be made available for conducting these tests. TheAgency does agree that the neuropathology study could be combined withother neurological test protocols without adversely affecting the qualityof either study, if the provisions of both guidelines are followed.5. <T3>Mutagenicity testing.</T3> CMA agrees that the dominant lethal studyconducted by Aleksandrov (Ref. 15) is inadequate and that the dominantlethal effect should be further examined by performing a second assay,but states that proceeding directly to the dominant lethal test shouldpreclude the necessity of lower tier testing.The Agency agrees that the necessity of lower-tier testing for chromosomalaberrations is precluded by industry's agreement to conduct a dominantlethal assay, and by the fact that a 2-year chronic bioassay has alreadybeen completed by NTP. Therefore, lower-tier mutagenicity testing willnot be required in this rule.D. New InformationResults of five pharmacokinetic studies (Refs. 21 through 25), comparingthe kinetics and metabolism of the oral and dermal routes of exposure,were voluntarily submitted to EPA by CMA. EPA has reviewed these studiesand finds them to be well-designed and well-performed. Further pharmacokinetictesting is not being required for MBT at this time; however, additionalpharmacokinetic testing may be required at a later date, pending reviewof the data generated as a result of this final rule.E. Persons Required to TestCMA commented that ``any testing to be mandated through a test rule shouldinclude among those responsible for the testing program persons who importrubber articles containing MBT.'' CMA pointed out that MBT is manufacturedabroad and imported to the United States both as a pure chemical and inmixtures, and as a constituent of articles.The Agency agrees with this comment, and has clarified in Unit III. E.of this preamble that the term ``manufacturers'' includes not only importersof MBT itself, but also importers of rubber articles that contain MBT.EPA believes that use and disposal of these articles contribute to humanand/or environmental exposures that are part of the basis for the Agency'sfinding that testing is warranted and necessary.Manufacturers are defined by TSCA section 3(7) to include those who ``importinto the customs territory of the United States.'' In other TSCA actionsunder sections 6 and 8, and in discussions of authority under sections5 and 13, EPA has determined that importation, whether it be in the formof imports of pure chemical substances, mixtures or articles, is includedwithin the TSCA definition of ``manufacture.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Findings </ITAG>A. Environmental Effects and Chemical Fate EPA is basing its final environmental effects and chemical fate testingrequirements for MBT on the authority of sections 4(a)(1) (A) and (B) ofTSCA. In addition to the information presented in this final rule, theTSCA sections 4(a)(1) (A) and (B) findings are also supported by additionalinformation discussed in the preamble to the proposed test rule for MBTand which is contained in the rulemaking record for this action. Under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B)(i), EPA finds that MBT is produced in substantialquantities. This finding takes into account TSCA section 8(a) informationthat was submitted by the manufacturers of MBT, the indirect productionof MBT as a result of the breakdown of MBT-derived accelerators duringvulcanization (Ref. 3), and the 1983 sales volume of MBT, which was reportedby the U.S. International Trade Commission to be 5,958,000 pounds (Ref.2).EPA also finds that there may be substantial quantities of MBT enteringthe environment. This finding considers TSCA section 8(a) release datasubmitted by the manufacturers of MBT, releases from processing, disposal,and coolants, and EPA's estimate that over 1 million pounds of MBT maybe lost to the environment annually through both direct and indirect discharges.MBT release is also expected to occur as a result of the breakdown of MBT-derivedaccelerators in discarded rubber products. Under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A)(i), EPA finds that the manufacture, processing,use, and disposal of MBT may present an unreasonable risk of injury toorganisms in the aquatic environment. EPA is basing this finding on EC50or LC50 values that are less than 100 times the minimum, median, or maximumpredicted environmental concentration (PEC) values, two LC50 values thatare less than 1 mg/L, and for an LC50 value greater than 1 mg/L but lessthan 100 mg/L, the 24-hr to 96-hr LC50 ratio is greater than 2. EPA believesthat chronic effects may occur at anticipated environmental concentrations.EPA has found no data on the chronic effects of MBT on fish and aquaticinvertebrates. EPA also concludes that data are insufficient to reasonablypredict the biodegradation, indirect photolysis, and chemical mobilityof MBT once it is released into the environment. Therefore, under TSCAsections 4(a)(1)(A)(ii) and 4(a)(1)(B)(ii), EPA concludes that availabledata are insufficient to reasonably determine or predict the chronic effectson fish and aquatic invertebrates from the manufacture, processing, use,and disposal of MBT, or the persistence and mobility of MBT released fromsuch activities. EPA finds that testing of MBT is necessary to developsuch data, and believes that data resulting from environmental effectsand chemical fate testing will be relevant to a determination as to whetherthe manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of MBT does or does not presentan unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. The Agency finds that sufficient data are available in the published literatureto satisfy the ITC's recommendation that the dissociation constant be determined.Two experimentally-derived values have been found in the literature indicatingthat the dissociation constant is 6.93 (Ref. 19).After reviewing and evaluating the existing aquatic toxicity data for MBT,EPA has determined that there are sufficient data available to reasonablypredict the acute toxicity of MBT to fish, aquatic invertebrates, and plants.MBT has been shown to exert a high acute toxicity in rainbow trout (Ref.6) with a 96-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 0.75 mg/L. <T3>Daphnia magna </T3>has been shown to have a 48-hour LC<T2>50</T2> value of 4.1 mg/L (Ref. 9), and <T3>Selenastrum capricornutum </T3>has a 96-hour EC<T2>50</T2> of 0.23 mg/L (Ref. 11). Therefore, EPA is not requiring anyadditional acute toxicity tests at this time. Should the existing dataand the chronic testing required in this rule provide results indicatinga high priority for control of aquatic concentrations of MBT under theClean Water Act, EPA may at that time propose additional acute and/or chronictesting to establish water quality criteria pursuant to section 304(a)(1)of the Clean Water Act.The Agency has no evidence of substantial exposure of terrestrial plantsalong the roadside to MBT from tire dust; therefore, the Agency did notpropose, and at this time is not requiring, any acute or chronic toxicitytesting for terrestrial plants, as had been recommended by the ITC.B. Human Health Effects EPA is basing its final health effects testing requirements for MBT onthe authority of TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B). EPA finds that MBT is producedin substantial quantities (See Unit III.A. of this preamble). EPA alsofinds that there may be substantial human exposure to MBT. The NationalOccupational Hazard Survey (NOHS), conducted from 1972 to 1974 (Ref. 20),estimates that as many as 558,893 people in the chemical industry may beexposed to MBT. The National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) data base(Ref. 4) estimates that 2,398 workers (of whom 119 are female) are exposedto MBT as a result of its presence in finished rubber products. EPA finds that there are sufficient data availably to reasonable determineor predict the pharmacokinetics, acute effects, chronic effects, oncogeniceffects, and gene mutation effects of exposure to MBT at this time. UnderTSCA section 4(A)(1)(B)(ii), EPA finds that there are insufficient dataavailable to reasonably determine or predict the effects of the manufacture,processing, use, and disposal of MBT in the areas of developmental toxicity,reproductive toxicity, chromosomal aberrations, and neurotoxicity. EPAfinds that testing of MBT is necessary to develop such data, and believesthat data resulting from health effects testing will be relevant to a determinationas to whether the manufacture, processing, use, or disposal of MBT doesor does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. C. Required Testing and Test StandardsOn the basis of these findings, EPA is requiring that chemical fate, environmentaleffects, and health effects testing be conducted for MBT in accordancewith specific test guidelines set forth in 40 CFR Parts 796, 797, and 798.The tests are to be conducted in accordance with EPA's TSCA Good LaboratoryPractice Standards in 40 CFR Part 792.On the basis of the findings presented above for chemical fate testing,the Agency is requiring that MBT be tested for: (1) Biodegradation usingthe test guideline specified in 40 CFR 796.3100; (2) indirect photolysisscreening using the test guideline specified in 40 CFR 795.70,\1\<NOTE/> promulgated with this final rule; and (3) chemical mobilityusing the test guideline specified in 40 CFR 796.2750.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ andSection;795.70 <T3>Indirect photolysis screening test: Sunlight photolysis in waters containingdissolved humic substances, </T3>was proposed as andSection;796.3765 in 51FR 472; January 6, 1986.On the basis of the findings presented in Unit III.A. for environmentaleffects testing, the Agency is requiring that chronic toxicity testingof MBT be conducted on (1) rainbow trout (<T3>Salmo gairdneri</T3>) using the test guideline specified in 40 CFR797.1600; and (2) <T3>Daphnia magna </T3>using the test guidelines specified in 40 CFR 797.1330.On the basis of the findings presented in Unit III.B. of this preamblefor health effects testing, the Agency is requiring that MBT be testedfor: (1) Developmental toxicity in two mammalian species using the testguideline specified in 40 CFR 798.4900; (2) reproductive toxicity usingthe test guideline specified in 40 CFR 798.4700; (3) neurotoxicity usingthe test guidelines specified in 40 CFR 798.6050, 798.6200 and 798.6400;and (4) mutagenicity (dominant-lethal assay) using the guidelines specifiedin 40 CFR 798.5450. A positive result in the dominant-lethal assay may,after a public program review, trigger a heritable translocation assayusing the procedure specified in 40 CFR 798.5460. If the dominant-lethalassay is negative, no further chromosomal aberration testing shall be requiredfor MBT.If the results of the dominant-lethal assay are positive, EPA will holda public program review prior to requiring the initiation of the heritabletranslocation assay. Public participation in this program review will bein the form of written comments or a public meeting. Request for publiccomments or notification of a public meeting will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Should EPA determine, from the available weightof evidence, that proceeding to the heritable translocation test is nolonger warranted, the Agency would propose to repeal that test requirementand, after public comment, issue a final amendment to rescind the requirement.EPA is requiring that the TSCA Chemical Fate, Environmental Effects, andHealth Effects Test Guidelines referenced in Unit III.C. of this preamble,and revisions, shall be the test standards for the purposes of the requiredtests for MBT. The TSCA test guidelines for chemical fate, aquatic toxicity,and health effects testing specify generally accepted minimum conditionsfor determining chemical fate, aquatic organism toxicities, and healtheffects for substances such as MBT to which humans and the environmentare expected to be exposed. The Agency believes that these test methodsreflect the current state of the science for testing chemicals such asMBT for the specified end points. The guidelines for rainbow trout and<T3>Daphnia magna</T3> chronic toxicity have been modified in this rule,due to concern over the stability of MBT in water.D. Test SubstanceEPA is requiring that MBT of at least 98 percent purity shall be used asthe test substance. MBT of such purity is commercially available.E. Persons Required to TestSection 4(b)(3)(B) specifies that the activities for which the Agency makessection 4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce,use, and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testinga chemical. Manufacturers and persons who intend to manufacture the chemicalare required to test if the findings are based on manufacturing (``manufacture''is defined in section 3(7) of TSCA to include ``import,'' and in this caseincludes importers of rubber articles that contain MBT). ``Manufacture''also includes byproduct manufacture, and while EPA has not identified anybyproduct manufacturers of MBT, such persons are subject to the requirementsof this test rule. Processors and persons who intend to process the chemicalare required to test if the findings are based on processing. Manufacturersand processors and persons who intend to manufacture or process the chemicalare required to test if the exposures giving rise to the potential riskoccur during distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical.Because EPA has found that manufacturing, processing, use, and disposalof MBT results in exposure that may lead to an unreasonable risk, EPA isrequiring that persons who manufacture or process, or who intend to manufactureor process, MBT, other than as an impurity, at any time from the effectivedate of the final test rule to the end of the reimbursement period aresubject to the testing requirements contained in this final rule. The endof the reimbursement period will be 5 years after the last final reportis submitted or an amount of time equal to that which was required to developdata, whichever is later.Because TSCA contains provisions to avoid duplicative testing, not everyperson subject to this rule must individually conduct testing. Section4(b)(3)(A) of TSCA provides that EPA may permit two or more manufacturersor processors who are subject to the rule to designate one such personor a qualified third person to conduct the tests and submit data on theirbehalf. Section 4(c) provides that any person required to test may applyto EPA for an exemption from the requirement. EPA has promulgated proceduresfor applying for TSCA section 4(c) exemptions in 40 CFR Part 790.Manufacturers (including importers) subject to this rule are required tosubmit either a letter of intent to perform testing or an exemption applicationwithin 30 days after the effective date of the final test rule. The requiredprocedures for submitting such letters and applications are described in40 CFR Part 790.Processors subject to this rule, unless they are also manufacturers, willnot be required to submit letters of intent or exemption applications,or to conduct testing, unless manufacturers fail to submit notices of intentto test or later fail to sponsor the required tests. The Agency expectsthat the manufacturers will pass an appropriate portion of the costs oftesting on to processors through the pricing of their products or otherreimbursement mechanisms. If manufacturers perform all the required tests,processors will be granted exemptions automatically. If manufacturers failto submit notices of intent to test, or fail to sponsor all the requiredtests, EPA will publish a separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to notify processors to respond; this procedureis described in 40 CFR Part 790.EPA is not requiring the submission of equivalence data as a conditionfor exemption from the required testing for MBT. EPA is interested in evaluatingthe effects attributable to MBT and has specified a relatively pure substancefor testing (See Unit III.D. of this preamble).Manufacturers and processors subject to this test rule must comply withthe test rule development and exemption procedures in 40 CFR Part 790 forsingle-phase rulemaking.F. Reporting RequirementsEPA is requiring that all data developed under this rule be reported inaccordance with its TSCA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards, whichappear in 40 CFR Part 792.In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors are required to submit individual study plans at least 45days before initiation of each test.EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data. Final testingrequirements, test standards, and reporting requirements for this MBT testrule are summarized in the following Table.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Required Testing, Test Standards, and Reporting Requirements for MBT</T4><H1>Test</H1><H1>Test standard (40 CFR citation) (section)</H1><H1>Reporting deadline for final report \1\</H1><H1>Interim (6 month) reports required</H1>Chemical fate: <ITAG tagnum="2">1.

The dominant-lethal assay and heritable translocation tests for MBTshall be completed and the final results submitted to the Agency afterthe effective date of this final test rule as follows: Dominant-lethalassay, 12 months; heritable translocation assay, 24 months after notificationthat testing shall be initiated. There will be a public program reviewbefore the heritable translocation test is conducted. Interim progressreports shall be provided to the Agency at 6 month intervals after theeffective date of this rule, until the final report is submitted to EPA.TSCA section 14(b) governs Agency disclosure of all test data submittedpursuant to section 4 of TSCA. Upon receipt of data required by this rule,the Agency will publish a notice of receipt in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as required by section 4(d).Persons who export a chemical which is subject to a section 4 test ruleare subject to the export reporting requirements of section 12(b) of TSCA.Final regulations interpreting the requirements of section 12(b) are in40 CFR Part 707. In brief, as of the effective date of this test rule,an exporter of MBT must report to EPA the first annual export or intendedexport of MBT to each country. EPA will notify the foreign country concerningthe test rule for the chemical.G. Enforcement ProvisionsEPA considers failure to comply with any aspect of a section 4 rule tobe a violation of section 15 of TSCA. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes it unlawfulfor any person to fail or refuse to comply with any rule or order issuedunder section 4. Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for any personto fail or refuse to: (1) Establish or maintain records, (2) submit reports,notices, or other information, or (3) permit access to or copying of recordsrequired by the Act or any regulation or rule issued under TSCA.Additionally, TSCA section 15(4) makes it unlawful for any person to failor refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by TSCA section 11.Section 11 applies to any ``establishment, facility, or other premisesin which chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured, processed, stored,or held before or after their distribution in commerce * * *.'' EPA considersa testing facility to be a place where the chemical is held or stored and,therefore, subject to inspection. Laboratory inspections and data auditswill be conducted periodically in accordance with the authority and proceduresoutlined in TSCA section 11 by designated representatives of the EPA forthe purpose of determining compliance with the final rule for MBT. Theseinspections may be conducted for purposes which include verification thattesting has begun, schedules are being met, and reports accurately reflectthe underlying raw data, interpretations, and evaluation, and to determinecompliance with TSCA GLP standards and the test standards established inthis rule.EPA's authority to inspect a testing facility also derives from section4(b)(1) of TSCA which directs EPA to promulgate standards for the developmentof test data. These standards are defined in section 3(12)(B) of TSCA toinclude those requirements necessary to assure that data developed undertesting rules are reliable and adequate, and such other requirements asare necessary to provide such assurance. The Agency maintains that laboratoryinspections are necessary to provide this assurance.Violators of TSCA are subject to criminal and civil liability. Personswho submit materially misleading or false information in connection withthe requirement of any provision of this rule may be subject to penaltieswhich may be calculated as if they never submitted their data. Under thepenalty provisions of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 of TSCA could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for eachviolation, with each day of operation constituting a separate violation.This provision would be applicable primarily to manufacturers that failto submit a letter of intent or an exemption request and that continuemanufacturing after the deadlines for such submissions.This provision would also apply to processors that fail to submit a letterof intent or an exemption application and continue processing after EPAhas notified them of their obligation to submit such documents (see 40CFR 790.48(b)). Knowing or willful violations could lead to the impositionof criminal penalties of up to $25,000 for each day of violation and imprisonmentfor up to 1 year. In determining the amount of penalty, EPA will take intoaccount the seriousness of the violation and the degree of culpabilityof the violator as well as all the other factors listed in TSCA section16. Other remedies are available to EPA under section 17 of TSCA, suchas seeking an injunction to restrain violations of TSCA section 4.Individuals as well as corporations could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates provisionsof TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as wellas companies themselves. In particular, this includes individuals who reportfalse information or who cause it to be reported. In addition, the submissionof false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements is a violation under 18U.S.C. 1001.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis of Final Rule</ITAG>To assess the potential economic impact of this rule, EPA has preparedan economic analysis (contained in the public record for this rule) thatevaluates the potential for significant economic impact on the industryas a result of the required testing. The economic analysis estimates thecosts of conducting the required testing and evaluates the potential forsignificant adverse economic impact as a result of these test costs byexamining four market characteristics of MBT: (1) Price sensitivity ofdemand, (2) market expectations, (3) industry cost characteristics, and(4) industry structure.Total testing costs for the required testing for MBT are estimated to rangefrom $434,970 to $583,730. In order to predict the financial decision-makingpractice of manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualizedcosts are compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period in order to finance thetesting expenditure in the first year.The annualized test costs (using a 7 percent cost of capital over a periodof 15 years) range from $47,758 to $64,088. Based on 1984 production of47.3 million pounds, the unit test costs range from 0.10 to 0.14 dollarper pound. These costs are equivalent to 0.09 to 0.11 percent of priceof the current price of 1.25 dollar per pound.EPA believes that the potential for adverse economic impact resulting fromthe costs of testing is low. This conclusion is based on the followingobservations:1. The annualized cost of testing is very low, at approximately 0.11 percentof product price in the upper-bound case.2. Demand for MBT does not appear to be sensitive to a price increase inthis range.Refer to the economic analysis contained in the public record for thisrulemaking for a complete discussion of test cost estimation and potentialfor economic impact resulting from these costs.  <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel  </ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``* * * the reasonablyforeseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to performthe testing required under the rule.'' Therefore, EPA conducted a studyto assess the availability of test facilities and personnel to handle theadditional demand for testing services created by section 4 test rules.Copies of the study, Chemical Testing Industry: Profile of ToxicologicalTesting, can be obtained through the National Technical Information Service(NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB 82-140773). Onthe basis of this study, EPA believes that there will be available testfacilities and personnel to perform the testing specified in this rule. EPA has reviewed the availability of contract laboratory facilities toconduct the neurotoxicity testing requirements (Ref. 29) and believes thatfacilities will be made available for conducting these tests. The laboratoryreview indicates that few laboratories are currently conducting these testsaccording to TSCA test guidelines and TSCA GLP standards. However, thebarriers faced by testing laboratories to gear up for these tests are notformidable. Laboratories will need to invest in testing equipment and personneltraining, but EPA believes that these investments will be recovered asthe neurotoxicity testing program under TSCA section 4 continues. EPA'sexpectations of laboratory availability were borne out under the testingrequirements of C<T2>9 </T2>aromatic hydrocarbon fraction test rule (50 FR 20675; May 17,1985). Pursuant to that rule, the manufacturers were able to contract witha laboratory to conduct the testing according to TSCA test quidelines andTSCA GLP standards.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule is not major because it does notmeet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order; i.e.,it will not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,will not cause a major increase in prices, and will not have significantadverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterprises to competewith foreign enterprises. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included in therulemaking record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (15 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>, Pub. L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), EPA is certifyingthat this test rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses because: (1) They are not likely to performtesting themselves, or to participate in the organization of the testingeffort; (2) they will experience only very minor costs, if any, in securingexemption from testing requirements; and (3) they are unlikely to be affectedby reimbursement requirements. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements contained in this rule have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0033. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 535 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,search existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 795 and 799 </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Testing, Laboratories,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 26, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Susan F.

In the first case, the chemical of interestabsorbs sunlight directly and is transformed to products when unstableexcited states of the molecule decompose. In the second case, reactionof dissolved chemical is the result of chemical or electronic excitationtransfer from light-absorbing humic species in the natural water. In contrastto direct photolysis, this photoreaction is governed initially by the spectroscopicproperties of the natural water.(2) In general, both indirect and direct processes can proceed simultaneously.Under favorable conditions the measurement of a photoreaction rate constantin sunlight (K<T2>pE</T2>) in a natural water body will yield a net value that is thesum of two first-order reaction rate constants for the direct (k<T2>DE</T2>) and indirect (k<T2>IE</T2>) pathways which can be expressed by the relationshipEquation 1<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>pE</T2>=k<T2>DE</T2>+k<T2>IE</T2>.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This relationship is obtained when the reaction volume is opticallythin so that a negligible fraction of the incident light is absorbed andis sufficiently dilute in test chemical; thus the direct and indirect photoreactionprocesses become first-order.(3) In pure water only, direct photoreaction is possible, although hydrolysis,biotransformation, sorption, and volatilization also can decrease the concentratonof a test chemical. By measuring k<T2>pE</T2> in a natural water and k<T2>DE</T2> in pure water, k<T2>IE</T2> can be calculated.(4) Two protocols have been written that measure k<T2>DE</T2> in sunlight or predict k<T2>DE</T2> in sunlight from laboratory measurements with monochromaticlight (USEPA (1984) under paragraph (f)(14) and (15) of this section; Millet al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(9) of this section; Mill et al. (1982)under paragraph (f)(10) of this section; Mill et al. (1983) under paragraphs(f)(11) of this section). As a preface to the use of the present protocol,it is not necessary to know k<T2>DE</T2>; it will be determined under conditions that definitively establishwhether k<T2>IE</T2> is significant with respect to k<T2>DE</T2>.(5) This protocol provides a cost effective test method for measuring k<T2>IE</T2> for test chemicals in a natural water (synthetic humic water,SHW) derived from commercial humic material. It describes the preparationand standardization of SHW. To implement the method, a test chemical isexposed to sunlight in round tubes containing SHW and tubes containingpure water for defined periods of time based on a screening test.(6) To correct for variations in solar irradiance during the reaction period,an actinometer is simultaneously insolated. From these data, an indirectphotoreaction rate constant is calculated that is applicable to clear-sky,near-surface, conditions in fresh water bodies.(7) In contrast to k<T2>DE</T2>, which, once measured, can be calculated for different seasonsand latitudes, k<T2>IE</T2> only applies to the season and latitude for which it is determined.This condition exists because the solar action spectrum for indirect photoreactionin humic-containing waters is not generally known and would be expectedto change for different test chemicals. For this reason, k<T2>pE</T2>, which contains k<T2>IE</T2>, is likewise valid only for the experimental data and latitude.(8) The value of k<T2>pE</T2> represents an atypical quantity because k<T2>IE</T2> will change somewhat from water body to water body as the amountand quality of dissolved aquatic humic substances change. Studies haveshown, however, that for optically-matched natural waters, these differencesare usually within a factor of two (Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraph(f)(17) of this section).(9) This protocol consists of three separate phases that should be completedin the following order: In Phase 1, SHW is prepared and adjusted; in Phase2, the test chemical is irradiated in SHW and pure water (PW) to obtainapproximate sunlight photoreaction rate constants and to determine whetherdirect and indirect photoprocesses are important; in Phase 3, the testchemical is again irradiated in PW and SHW. To correct for photobleachingof SHW and also solar irradiance variations, tubes containing SHW and actinometersolutions are exposed simultaneously. From these data k<T2>pE</T2> is calculated that is the sum of k<T2>IE</T2> and k<T2>DE</T2> (Equation 1) (Winterle and Mill (1985) under paragraph (f)(12)of this section).(b) <T3>Phase 1_Preparation and standardization of synthetic natural water</T3>_(1)<T3>Approach. </T3>(i) Recent studies have demonstrated that natural waterscan promote the indirect (or sensitized) photoreaction of dissolved organicchemicals. This reactivity is imparted by dissolved organic material (DOM)in the form of humic substances. These materials absorb sunlight and producereactive intermediates that include singlet oxygen (10<T2>2</T2>) (Zepp et al. (1977) under paragraph (f)(20) of this section,Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(17) of this section, Zepp et al.(1981) under paragraph (f)(18) of this section, Wolff et al. (1981) underparagraph (f)(16) of this section, Haag et al. (1984) under paragraph (f)(6)of this section, Haag et al. (1984) under paragraph (f)(7) of this section);peroxy radicals (RO<T2>2</T2>andCx.1;) (Mill et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(9) of this section;Mill et al. (1983) under paragraph (f)(8) of this section); hydroxyl radicals(HOandCx.1;) (Mill et al. (1981) under paragraph (f)(9) of this section,Draper and Crosby (1981, 1984) under paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of thissection); superoxide anion (0<T2>2</T2>^andCx.1;) and hydroperoxy radicals (HO<T2/>andCx.1;). (Cooper and Zika (1983) under paragraph (f)(1) of thissection, Draper and Crosby (1983) under paragraph (f)(2) of this section);and triplet excited states of the humic substances (Zepp et al. (1981)under paragraph (f)(17) of this section, Zepp et al. (1985) under paragraph(f)(21) of this section). Synthetic humic waters, prepared by extractingcommercial humic or fulvic materials with water, photoreact similarly tonatural waters when optically matched (Zepp et al. (1981) under paragraphs(f)(17) and (18) of this section).(ii) The indirect photoreactivity of a chemical in a natural water willdepend on its response to these reactive intermediates, and possibly othersyet unknown, as well as the ability of the water to generate such species.This latter feature will vary from water-to-water in an unpredictable way,judged by the complexity of the situation.(iii) The approach to standardizing a test for indirect photoreactivityis to use a synthetic humic water (SHW) prepared by water-extracting commercialhumic material. This material is inexpensive, and available to any laboratory,in contrast to a specific natural water. The SHW can be diluted to a dissolvedorganic carbon (DOC) content and uv-visible absorbance typical of mostsurface fresh waters.(iv) In recent studies it has been found that the reactivity of SHW mixturesdepends on pH, and also the history of sunlight exposure (Mill et al. (1983)under paragraph (f)(11) of this section). The SHW solutions initially photobleachwith a time-dependent rate constant. As such, an SHW test system has beendesigned that is buffered to maintain pH and is pre-aged in sunlight toproduce, subsequently, a predictable bleaching behavior.(v) The purpose of Phase 1 is to prepare, pre-age, and dilute SHW to astandard mixture under defined, reproducible conditions.(2) <T3>Procedure.</T3> (i) Twenty grams of Aldrich humic acid are added toa clean 2-liter Pyrex Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is filled with 2 litersof 0.1 percent NaOH solution. A stir bar is added to the flask, the flaskis capped, and the solution is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature.At the end of this time the dark brown supernatant is decanted off andeither filtered through coarse filter paper or centrifuged and then filteredthrough 0.4 )m microfilter. The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with dilute H<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2> and filter sterilized through a 0.2 )m filter into a rigorouslycleaned 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask. This mixture contains roughly 60 ppmDOC and the absorbance (in a 1 cm path length cell) is approximately 1.7at 313 nm and 0.7 at 370 nm.(ii) Pre-aging is accomplished by exposing the concentrated solution inthe 2-liter flask to direct sunlight for 4 days in early spring or latefall; 3 days in late spring, summer, or early fall. At this time the absorbanceof the solution is measured at 370 nm, and a dilution factor is calculatedto decrease the absorbance to 0.50 in a 1 cm path length cell. If necessary,the pH is re-adjusted to 7.0. Finally, the mixture is brought to exactdilution with a precalculated volume of reagent-grade water to give a finalabsorbance of 0.500 in a 1-cm path length cell at 370 nm. It is tightlycapped and refrigerated.(iii) This mixture is SHW stock solution. Before use it is diluted 10-foldwith 0.010 M phosphate buffer to produce a pH 7.0 mixture with an absorbanceof 5.00 x 10^2 at 370 nm, and a dissolved organic carbon of about 5 ppm.Such values are characteristic of many surface fresh waters.(3) <T3>Rationale.</T3> The foregoing procedure is designed to produce a standardhumic-containing solution that is pH controlled, and sufficiently agedthat its photobleaching first-order rate constant is not time dependent.It has been demonstrated that after 7 days of winter sunlight exposure,SHW solutions photobleached with a nearly constant rate constant (Millet al. (1983) under paragraph (f)(11) of this section).(c) <T3>Phase 2_Screening test_</T3>(1) <T3>Introduction and purpose.</T3> (i) Phase 2 measurements provide approximatesolar photolysis rate constants and half-lives of test chemicals in PWand SHW. If the photoreaction rate in SHW is significantly larger thanin PW (factor of andgreater; 2X) then the test chemical is subject to indirectphotoreaction and Phase 3 is necessary. Phase 2 data are needed for moreaccurate Phase 3 measurements, which require parallel solar irradiationof actinometer and test chemical solutions. The actinometer compositionis adjusted according to the results of Phase 2 for each chemical, to equalizeas much as possible photoreaction rate constants of chemical in SHW andactinometer.(ii) In Phase 2, sunlight photoreaction rate constants are measured inround tubes containing SHW and then mathematically corrected to a flatwater surface geometry. These rate constants are not corrected to clear-skyconditions.(2) <T3>Procedure.</T3> (i) Solutions of test chemicals should be preparedusing sterile, air-saturated, 0.010 M, pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and reagent-grade(or purer) chemicals.\1\<NOTE/> Reaction mixtures should be prepared with chemicals at concentrationsat less than one-half their solubility in pure water and at concentrationssuch that, at any wavelengths above 290 nm, the absorbance in a standardquartz sample cell with a 1-cm path length is less than 0.05. If the chemicalsare too insoluble in water to permit reasonable handling or analyticalprocedures, 1-volume percent acetonitrile may be added to the buffer asa cosolvent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The water should be ASTM Type IIA, or an equivalent grade.(ii) This solution should be mixed 9.00:1.00 by volume with PW or SHW stocksolution to provide working solutions. In the case of SHW, it gives a ten-folddilution of SHW stock solution. Six mL aliquots of each working solutionshould then be transferred to separate 12 andmultiply; 100 mm quartz tubeswith screw tops and tightly sealed with Mininert valves.\2\<NOTE/> Twenty four tubes are required for each chemical solution(12 samples and 12 dark controls), to give a total of 48 tubes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Mininert Teflon sampling vials are available from AlltechAssociates, Inc., 202 Campus Dr., Arlington Heights, IL 60004.(iii) The sample tubes are mounted in a photolysis rack with the tops facinggeographically north and inclined 30anddegrees; from the horizontal. Therack should be placed outdoors over a black background in a location freeof shadows and excessive reflection.(iv) Reaction progress should be measured with an analytical techniquethat provides a precision of at least andplusmin;5 percent. High pressureliquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatograph (GC) have proven to bethe most general and precise analytical techniques.(v) Sample and control solution concentrations are calculated by averaginganalytical measurements for each solution. Control solutions should beanalyzed at least twice at zero time and at other times to determine whetherany loss of chemical in controls or samples has occurred by some adventitiousprocess during the experiment.(vi) Whenever possible the following procedures should be completed inclear, warm, weather so that solutions will photolyze more quickly andnot freeze.(A) Starting at noon on day zero, expose to sunlight 24 sample tubes mountedon the rack described above. Tape 24 foil-wrapped controls to the bottomof the rack.(B) Analyze two sample tubes and two unexposed controls in PW and SHW forchemical at 24 hours. Calculate the round tube photolysis rate constants(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2> if the percent conversions are J 20 percent but F 80 percent.The rate constants (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2> are calculated, respectively, from Equations 2 and 3:Equation 2<ITAG tagnum="26">(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>=(1/t)Pn(C<T2>o</T2>/C<T2>t</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> (in d^1)</ITAG>Equation 3<ITAG tagnum="26">(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2>=(1/t)Pn(C<T2>o</T2>/C<T2>t</T2>)<T2>W</T2> (in d^1),</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where the subscript identifies a reaction in SHW or PW; t is the photolysistime in calendar days; C<T2>o</T2> is the initial molar concentration; and C<T2>t</T2> is the molar concentration in the irradiated tube at t. In thiscase t=1 day.(C) If less than 20 percent conversion occurs in SHW in 1 day, repeat theprocedure for SHW and PW at 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, or 16 days, or until20 percent conversion is reached. Do not extend the experiment past 16days. If less than 20 percent photoreaction occurs in SHW at the end of16 days the chemical is ``photoinert''. Phase 3 is not applicable.(D) If more than 80 percent photoreaction occurs at the end of day 1 inSHW, repeat the experiment with eight each of the remaining foil-wrappedPW and SHW controls. Divide these sets into four sample tubes each, leavingfour foil-wrapped controls taped to the bottom of the rack.(<T3>1</T3>) Expose tubes of chemical in SHW and PW to sunlight startingat 0900 hours and remove one tube and one control at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours.Analyze all tubes the next day.(<T3>2</T3>) Extimate (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> for the first tube in which photoreaction is J 20 percentbut F 80 percent. If more than 80 percent conversion occurs in the firstSHW tube, report: ``The half-life is less than one hour'' and end all testing.The chemical is ``photolabile.'' Phase 3 is not applicable.(<T3>3</T3>) The rate constants (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2> are calculated from equations 2 and 3 but the time of irradiationmust be adjusted to reflect the fact that day-averaged rate constants areapproximately one-third of rate constants averaged over only 8 daylighthours. For 1 hour of insolation enter t=0.125 day into equation 2. Forreaction times of 2, 4, and 8 hours enter 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 days, respectively.Proceed to Phase 3 testing.(<T3>4</T3>) Once (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2> are measured, determine the ratio R from equation 4:Equation 4<ITAG tagnum="26">R=(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>/(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2>.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The coefficient R, defined by Equation 4, is equal to [(k<T2>I</T2>+k<T2>D</T2>)/k<T2>D</T2>]. If R is in the range 0 to 1, the photoreaction is inhibitedby the synthetic humic water and Phase 3 does not apply. If R is in therange 1 to 2, the test chemical is marginally susceptable to indirect photolysis.In this case, Phase 3 studies are optional. If R is greater than 2, Phase3 measurements are necessary to measure k<T2>pE</T2> and to evaluate k<T2>IE</T2>.(vii) Since the rate of photolysis in tubes is faster than the rate innatural water bodies, values of near-surface photolysis rate constantsin natural and pure water bodies, k<T2>pE</T2> and k<T2>DE</T2>, respectively, can be obtained from (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW </T2>and (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2> from Equations 5 and 6:Equation 5<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>pE</T2>=0.45(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2></ITAG>Equation 6<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>DE</T2>=0.45(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>W</T2>.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The factor 0.45 is an approximate geometric correction for scatteredlight in tubes versus horizontal surfaces. A rough value of k<T2>IE</T2>, the rate constant for indirect photolysis in natural watersor SHW, can be estimated from the difference between k<T2>pE</T2> and k<T2>DE</T2> using Equation 7:Equation 7<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>IE</T2>=k<T2>pE</T2>^k<T2>DE</T2>.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Criteria for Phase 2.</T3> (i) If no loss of chemical is found in darkcontrol solutions compared with the analysis in tubes at zero time (withinexperimental error), any loss of chemical in sunlight is assumed to bedue to photolysis, and the procedure provides a valid estimate of k<T2>pE</T2> and k<T2>DE</T2>. Any loss of chemical in the dark-control solutions may indicatethe intervention of some other loss process such as hydrolysis, microbialdegradation, or volatilization. In this case, more detailed experimentsare needed to trace the problem and if possible eliminate or minimize thesource of loss.(ii) Rate constants determined by the Phase 2 protocol depend upon latitude,season, and weather conditions. Note that (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and k<T2>D</T2> values apply to round tubes and k<T2>pE</T2> and k<T2>DE</T2> values apply to a natural water body. Because both (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> and k<T2>D</T2> are measured under the same conditions the ratio ((k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>/k<T2>D</T2>) is a valid measure of the susceptibility of a chemical to indirectphotolysis. However, since SHW is subject to photobleaching, (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> will decrease with time because the indirect rate will diminish.Therefore, R andgreater;2 is considered to be a conservative limit because(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> will become systematically smaller with time.(4) <T3>Rationale.</T3> The Phase 2 protocol is a simple procedure for evaluatingdirect and indirect sunlight photolysis rate constants of a chemical ata specific time of year and latitude. It provides a rough rate constantfor the chemical in SHW that is necessary for Phase 3 testing. By comparisonwith the direct photoreaction rate constant, it can be seen whether thechemical is subject to indirect photoreaction and whether Phase 3 testsare necessary.(5) <T3>Scope and limitations.</T3> (i) Phase 2 testing separates test chemicalsinto three convenient categories: ``Photolabile'', ``photoinert'', andthose chemicals having sunlight half-lives in round tubes in the rangeof 1 hour to 50 days. Chemicals in the first two categories fall outsidethe practical limits of the test, and cannot be used in Phase 3. All otherchemicals are suitable for Phase 3 testing.(ii) The test procedure is simple and inexpensive, but does require thatthe chemical dissolve in water at sufficient concentrations to be measuredby some analytical technique but not have appreciable absorbance in therange 290 to 825 nm. Phase 2 tests should be done during a clear-sky periodto obtain the best results. Testing will be less accurate for chemicalswith half-lives of less than 1 day because dramatic fluctuations in sunlightintensity can arise from transient weather conditions and the difficultyof assigning equivalent reaction times. Normal diurnal variations alsoaffect the photolysis rate constant. Phase 3 tests should be started assoon as possible after the Phase 2 tests to ensure that the (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> estimate remains valid.(6) <T3>Illustrative Example</T3>. (i) Chemical A was dissolved in 0.010 MpH 7.0 buffer. The solution was filtered through a 0.2 )m filter, air saturated,and analyzed. It contained 1.7andmultiply;10 ^5 M A, five-fold less thanits water solubility of 8.5andmultiply;10 ^5 M at 25anddegrees;C. A uv spectrum(1-cm path length) versus buffer blank showed no absorbance greater than0.05 in the wavelength interval 290 to 825 nm, a condition required forthe Phase 2 protocol. The 180 mL mixture was diluted by the addition of20 mL of SHW stock solution.(ii) The SHW solution of A was photolyzed in sealed quartz tubes (12andmultiply;100mm) in the fall season starting on October 1. At the end of 1 and 2 days,respectively, the concentration of A was found to be 1.13andmultiply;10 ^5M and 0.92andmultiply;10 ^5 M compared to unchanged dark controls (1.53andmultiply;10^5 M). (iii) The tube photolysis rate constant of chemical A was calculated fromEquation 2 under paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(B) of this section. The first timepoint at day 1 was used because the fraction of A remaining was in therange 20 to 80 percent:<ITAG tagnum="26">(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>=(1/1d)Pn(1.53andmultiply;10 ^5/1.13 andmultiply;10 ^5) (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>=0.30 d^1.</ITAG>(iv) From this value, k<T2>pE</T2> was found to be 0.14 d^1 using equation 5 under paragraph (c)(2)(vii)of this section:<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>pE</T2>=0.45(0.30 d^1)=0.14d^1.</ITAG>(v) From measurements in pure water, k<T2>D</T2> for chemical A was found to be 0.085 d^1. Because the ratioof (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2>/k<T2>D</T2>(=3.5) is greater than 2, Phase 3 experiments were started. (d) <T3>Phase 3_Indirect photoreaction with actinometer: Calculation of </T3>k<T2>IE</T2><T3> and </T3>k<T2>pE</T2>_(1) <T3>Introduction and purpose</T3>. (i) The purpose of Phase 3 is to measure k<T2>Io</T2>, the indirect photolysis rate constant in tubes, and then tocalculate k<T2>pE</T2> for the test chemical in a natural water. If the approximate(k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> determined in Phase 2 is not significantly greater than k<T2>D</T2> measured for the experiment date of Phase 2, then Phase 3 isunnecessary because the test chemical is not subject to indirect photoreaction.(ii) In the case (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> is significantly larger than k<T2>D</T2>, Phase 3 is necessary. The rate constant (k<T2>p</T2>)<T2>SHW</T2> is used to choose an actinometer composition that matchesthe actinometer rate to the test chemical rate. Test chemical solutionsin SHW and in pure water buffer are then irradiated in sunlight in parallelwith actinometer solutions, all in tubes.(iii) The actinometer used is the <T3>p</T3>-nitroacetophenone-pyridine (PNAP/PYR) system developed by Dulinand Mill (1982) under paragraph (f)(5) of this section and is used in twoEPA test guidelines (USEPA (1984) under paragraphs (f) (14) and (15) ofthis section). By varying the pyridine concentration, the PNAP photolysishalf-life can be adjusted over a range of several hours to several weeks.The starting PNAP concentration is held constant.(iv) SHW is subject to photobleaching that decreases its ability to promoteindirect photolysis based on its ability to absorb sunlight. This effectwill be significant when the test period exceeds a few days. To correctfor photobleaching, tubes containing SHW are irradiated in action to theother tubes above.(v) At any time, the loss of test chemical is given by Equation 8 assumingactinometric correction to constant light flux:Equation 8<ITAG tagnum="26">^(d[C]/dt)=k<T2>I</T2>[C]+k<T2>D</T2>[C].</ITAG>(vi) The indirect photolysis rate constant, k<T2>I</T2>, is actually time dependent because SHW photobleaches; the rateconstant k<T2>I</T2>, after pre-aging, obeys the formula:Equation 9<ITAG tagnum="26">k<T2>I</T2>=k<T2>Io</T2> exp(^kt),</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">in which k<T2>Io</T2> is the initial indirect photoreaction rate constant and k isthe SHW photobleaching rate constant.

Since in pure water, Pn(C<T2>o</T2>/C)<T2>W</T2>=k<T2>D</T2>t, then subtracting this equation from Equation 10 givesEquation 11<ITAG tagnum="26">Pn(C<T2>o</T2>/C)<T2>SHW</T2>-Pn(c<T2>o</T2>/C)<T2>W</T2>=(k<T2>Io</T2>/k)[1-exp(-kt)].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The photobleaching fraction, [1-exp(-kt)], is equivalent to the expression[1-(A<T2>370</T2>/Aanddegrees;<T2>370</T2>)], where Aanddegrees;<T2>370</T2> and A<T2>370</T2> are the absorbances at 370 nm, and are proportional to humicsensitizer content at times zero and t.
