Kohlberg Kravis said that based on its assessment of therestructuring proposal, it was willing to pay $64 in cash andsecurities for each of Kroger's 78.6 million shares outstanding. Ithad offer $58.50 in cash and securities previously.   The announcement revived prospects for another round of biddingfor Kroger, one of the nation's largest supermarket chains that haslong been identified as a takeover target.   ``The Kroger Company's management, legal and financial advisersare reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from KKR,'' said PaulBernish, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based Kroger.   He said the company had no further comment.   Kroger stock was among the most actively traded issues Tuesdayon the New York Stock Exchange, falling 87{ cents a share to$55.37{ as more than 1.2 million shares changed hands.   The chain has been resisting takeover maneuvers from KohlbergKravis and the Haft family of Maryland, two longtime adversarieswho have battled for other supermarket businesses in the past.   Kohlberg Kravis's sweetened offer was announced after businesshours, and there was no answer at the offices of Dart Group Inc.,the Haft-run retailing concern in Landover, Md.   As outlined in a brief press statement, the sweetened offer iscomposed of $50 in cash, $11 in debt securities and $3 in stock ofthe new company that Kohlberg Kravis would create from Kroger. Theinvestment firm's earlier offer contained the same cash portion of$50 but only $8.50 in securities.   Kroger announced an extensive restructuring plan on Sept. 13designed to foil bids from Kohlberg Kravis and the Hafts, who hadoffered $4.32 billion.   That restructuring plan, which Kroger valued at $4.6 billion,also would leave shareholders with a continuing interest in thecompany but would reshape it into a smaller, leaner and moreheavily indebted business.   Part of the plan included layoffs and the sale of operations,including some food processing facilities as well as stores inAlabama, California, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texasand Virginia.   The takeover struggle for Kroger began earlier in the month whenthe Hafts received clearance from federal antitrust regulators tobuy at least $15 million worth of Kroger stock.   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 conveniencestores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company alsoprocesses food products for sale in its stores and to outsidecustomers.</TEXT></DOC>
