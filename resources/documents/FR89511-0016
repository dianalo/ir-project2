Background</ITAG>Section 6 of the OFPP Act Amendments of 1988 amended the OFPP Act by addingsection 27, Procurement Integrity, which has been codified as section 423,Title 41 of the United States Code.The Act prohibits certain activities by competing contractors and Governmentprocurement officials during the conduct of a Federal agency procurement.In general, these prohibited activities involve soliciting or discussingpost-Government employment, offering or accepting a gratuity, or solicitingor disclosing proprietary or source selection information.The Act also contains certification and disclosure provisions for bothcontractors and Government officials, imposes post-employment restrictionson Government officials and employees, and provides for criminal, civil,administrative, and contractual penalties for violations of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Determination To Issue an Interim Regulation</ITAG>A determination has been made under authority of the Secretary of Defense(DoD), the Administrator of General Services (GSA), and the Administratorof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to issue theregulations in FAC 84-47 as an interim rule. This action is necessary toimplement in the FAR Pub. L. 100-679. However, pursuant to Pub. L. 98-577and FAR 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rulewill be considered in formulating a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was prepared for theproposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12556) and stated thatthe proposed change to the FAR may have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The impact is likely to occur because,in connection with contract awards and modifications in excess of $100,000,offerors will be required to gather and provide to the Government certaininformation regarding the activities of the offeror during the conductof the procurement. A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will be preparedfor the final rule. Comments are invited on this interim rule. Commentsfrom small entities concerning the affected FAR sections will be considered.Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 89-610 (FAC 84-47).<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements in this interim rule have beenapproved for 1 year under OMB Control Number 9000-0103 pending review ofthe public comments by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as requiredby 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Any additional public comments concerning theinformation collection requirements should be submitted to OMB, Ms. EyvetteFlynn, FAR Desk Officer, Room 3235, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Public Comments</ITAG>On March 27, 1989, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12556). In excess of 120 comments havebeen received in response to the proposed rule. Because of the time constraintsto comply with the May 16, 1989, implementation date mandated by Pub. L.100-679, we have taken into consideration as many comments as possiblein the formulation of this interim rule. However, all comments will befully considered in the formulation of the final rule.<T3>Reconciliation of public comments:</T3> As a result of the public comments,significant revisions have been made to the implementing coverage. A discussionof some of the more significant issues and the rationale for the resultantcoverage in this interim rule is provided below:The proposed rule provided two methods to identify the beginning of theconduct of a Federal agency procurement. In the case of major systems,the rule provided that the program manager would publish in the CommerceBusiness Daily the date on which a procurement begins. For all other procurements,the contracting officer would identify in the solicitation, the date onwhich the procurement began. Commenters stated that the notification ofwhen a procurement begins must be given prospectively for all procurements,regardless of dollar value. Other commenters questioned the need for andpropriety of any notification, whether prospective or retroactive.The prohibitions of the Act apply to every procurement conducted by Federalagencies regardless of dollar value. The types of procurements and theprocedures for conducting procurements are as varied as the agencies thatconduct them. Even within a particular agency, there is no single methodof procurement and no single set of procedures for every procurement. Procurementconsists of a myriad of activities and events that vary from agency toagency and even within an agency. Indeed, many events or activities occurat locations physically far away from and without the knowledge of thecontracting officer who will ultimately be responsible for the procurement.From an administrative viewpoint, the burden, as some commenters noted,entailed in attempting to identify when a procurement begins is enormous.The vastly different types and nature of procurements conducted throughoutthe Federal Government make it impossible to identify one event that iscommon to all agencies, that constitutes the beginning of a procurement.Moreover, the arduous task of attempting to make this identification forevery procurement inevitably will cause delays and additional expensesbecause of those delays. The suggestion by some commenters that issuanceof the solicitation constitutes the beginning of the conduct of a procurementsatisfies neither the terms of the Act not its intent.As at least one commenter noted, inherent in the authority to establishthe date on which a procurement begins, whether prospectively or retroactively,is the opportunity for individuals who have knowingly violated the Actto absolve themselves from liability merely by establishing a date subsequentto that on which they engaged in prohibited conduct. Such a result is untenable,and undermines the very purpose of the statute.These considerations must be weighed against the benefits, if any, to thepublic in receiving notification either prospectively or retroactivelyof the beginning of the conduct of a procurement. It is axiomatic thatno person, at any time and regardless of whether a procurement has begun,should offer or solicit a gratuity or bribe, however couched. This conductis illegal at any time.Similarly, under existing regulations, it is improper to solicit or discloseinformation that a person knows or should know is proprietary or sourceselection information. To the extent that some commenters expressed concernsthat the definition of ``source selection information'' in the proposedrule was overly broad and therefore may not have given sufficient noticeas to the type of information that may not be solicited, obtained, or disclosed,the definition thereof has been changed substantially.The interim rule limits what may constitute source selection informationto two categories: that which is marked with the standard legend ``SOURCESELECTION INFORMATION_SEE 3.104'' and a very narrow category of information,whether or not marked with the legend, that will jeopardize the integrityof successful completion of a procurement if it were disclosed. The interimrule provides further that notwithstanding that this later category ofinformation shall constitute source selection information whether or notmarked as such, all reasonable efforts must be made to so mark it. In addition,the interim rule also provides that if an individual has any doubt as towhether information is proprietary or source selection information, heshould ask. Finally, in accordance with many of the comments, the interimrule provides that material that is subsequently marked as proprietaryor source selection information that is properly in the possession of theGovernment or a competing contractor as a result of a prior disclosurethat is not prohibited by the Act shall not be considered to have beensolicited or obtained in violation of the Act.With respect to the prohibition against offering or soliciting employmentor business opportunities, the proposed rule established a duty to inquire,which remains unchanged in the interim rule. Thus, prior to engaging ina discussion of employment or business opportunities with a Governmentofficial or employee, contractor personnel should inquire as to whetherthat official or employee is a procurement official for a procurement forwhich the contractor is a competing contractor. The rule imposes a correspondingduty on Government officials and employees who wish to solicit employmentfrom a potential competing contractor to ask whether that contractor isreasonably likely to become a competing contractor on any procurement forwhich that official or employee is a procurement official.Given the nature of the conduct that is prohibited by the Act and the factthat the Act penalizes only knowing conduct, notification either prospectiveor after the fact, of the beginning of a procurement would not serve aparticularly useful purpose and should not significantly affect the conductof contractor or Government personnel.Therefore, the requirement in the proposed rule to publish in the CBD anotice of when a procurement begins for a major system or elements thereofand the requirement to identify in the solicitation the date of which aprocurement began for all other procurements has been deleted from theinterim rule.Many commenters expressed concern over the definition of source selectioninformation, stating that it was overly broad and would result in a decreasein the amount of information that is made available to all competing contractors.Commenters also stated that much of the information contained in the listeddocuments, such as an acquisition plan, is not source selection informationand should not be restricted. Other commenters took exception to labellingsome documents by type and labelling other information or documents witha standard legend. Commenters believed that a standard legend for all sourceselection information would be more appropriate.The definition of source selection information has been revised substantiallyin the interim rule. Source selection information is defined as informationthat is prepared or developed for use by the Government for a particularprocurement. In addition, recognizing that marking some documents by typeand others with a standard legend could cause confusion, as well as beingoverly burdensome, the interim rule requires that source selection informationbe marked with the standard legend ``SOURCE SELECTION INFORMATION_SEE FAR3.104.''The interim rule also provides that certain specifically identified informationis source selection information whether or not it is marked with the legend.This information, such as offerors' prices, relative rankings, and theresults of technical evaluations, by its very nature, is clearly informationthat, if disclosed, will jeopardize the integrity or successful completionof a procurement. This is a very narrow category and is limited to onlynine types of material. Although this information is source selection informationwhether or not it is marked as such, 3.104-5(b) provides that all reasonableefforts will be made by the Government to mark this information.Most commenters also expressed concern over the provision in the proposedrule that included oral or written extracts in the definition of sourceselection information. The Act prohibits the knowing solicitation or receiptof source selection information. If an individual knows or should knowthat information is source selection information, the oral transmissionor receipt of that information is no less prohibited than the written transmissionor receipt of such information. Moreover, if an individual is uncertainas to whether information is source selection information, subsection 3.104-8provides that the procurement official or competing contractor shall notbe considered to have knowingly violated the Act if, before soliciting,obtaining, or disclosing the information the individual asks the appropriateparty whether the information is proprietary or source selection informationand is advised that it is not.The majority of commenters stated that the penalties of the Act are sosevere that the certification must include the ``best knowledge and belief''standard. Use of this standard is consistent with the certifications inthe Contract Disputes Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and the Departmentof Defense overhead cost certification. Accordingly, to address commenters'concerns, the interim rule includes the ``best knowledge and belief'' standardin the certificates.Many commenters believed that the rule should include greater due processprocedures. The commenters stated that determinations to take action basedupon receipt of information of a violation or possible violation shouldbe made only by the head of the agency. Other commenters stated that proceduresset out in the clause at 52.203-10, Remedies for Illegal or Improper Activity,should apply to subsection 3.104-11, Processing violations or possibleviolations.The rule provides that any action that is taken must be pursuant to a determinationby the head of the contracting activity, or his or her designee that therehas been a violation of the Act. Moreover, the designee must be of flag,SES, or equivalent rank. Therefore, any action taken is taken only aftercareful review by senior level officials of the agency.This rule does not abrogate existing remedies and due process procedures.Thus, in the case of action taken in the pre-award situation, the competingcontractor may pursue existing remedies administratively or judiciallyin a bid protest format. Similarly, a decision to terminate a contractfor default or to reduce a contractor's profit pursuant to the clause at52.203-10 may be appealed in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act.The clause at 52.203-10 provides a due process procedure wherein the contractormay present information and argument in opposition to the proposed profitor fee reduction. Moreover, the determination to reduce a contractor'sprofit or fee must be made by the head of the contracting activity or hisor her designee, who must be of flag, SES, or equivalent rank.Finally, the rule requires use of the formal procedures in FAR 3.700, priorto making a final decision to void or rescind a contract. This decision,moreover, may be made only by the head of the agency or his or her designee.These procedures provide for notice and an opportunity for a hearing atwhich witnesses may be presented and agency witnesses confronted. Thus,the regulation does not abrogate existing pre and post award remedies availableto competing contractors.Considerable comment was made of the fact that there should be one consistent,uniform regulation for all Government and contractor personnel. We agreethat individuals should not be required to certify that they have no informationof violations of the Act as implemented by agency regulations that maynot be published and thus of which they may not be aware. Therefore, thecertifications have been revised to delete the reference to agency supplements.However, a flat proscription of any agency supplementation is also notappropriate. There will be instances where agencies must supplement theFAR to satisfy unique agency needs. Indeed, both the Office of FederalProcurement Policy Act and the FAR currently recognize this fact and authorizeagency supplementation where it is necessary to satisfy unique needs ofan agency. However, with respect to this Act, to ensure that supplementationis kept to a minimum, FAR 3.104-1 has been revised to state that any agencysupplementation of FAR 3.104 and any clauses required by FAR 3.104 mustbe approved by the Senior Procurement Executive of that agency, unlessa higher level of approval is required by law for that agency.A provision has also been added to clarify the liability of offerors forprior authorized possession of source selection information. Commenterswere concerned that the rule made no provision to protect offerors in caseswhere the nature of the information in their possession has changed. FAR3.104-5(i) has been added which states that source selection informationthat is properly in the possession of the competing contractor as a resultof a prior disclosure that is not prohibited by the Act, shall not be consideredto have been solicited or obtained in violation of the Act.Several commenters suggested that the Government provide offerors the namesof individuals who are authorized to receive source selection informationbecause the statute prohibits disclosure of such information to any personother than a person authorized by the head of the agency or the contractingofficer. Specifically, it was suggested that such a list be included ina Commerce Business Daily notice announcing the beginning of the procurement.It was determined not to include this list as a requirement in the interimrule since any list of authorized individuals would be constantly changingduring the conduct of a procurement. Consequently, a list published atthe beginning of the procurement would not provide the information thesecommenters believe would protect offerors against improper disclosure.However, this rule does include a provision at 3.104-8(d) which statesthat an offeror shall not be considered to have knowingly violated theAct if the offeror has made an inquiry in good faith regarding whetherthe information was source selection, and had been advised that it wasnot.It was also suggested that the application of the rule to subcontractorsbe clarified. The suggestion has been adopted and FAR 3.104-9(b)(6) hasbeen added which states that subcontractors of competing contractors arenot required to submit certificates to the Government, but that nothingin the rule precludes a competing contractor from requesting certificatesfrom its subcontractors.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1, 3, 4, 9, 15, 37, 43, and 52</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.

It does not include: an option where all the terms of theoption are set forth in the contract and all requirements for option exercisehave been satisfied; change orders; administrative changes; or any othercontract changes that are within the scope of the contract.(f) ``Money, gratuity, or other thing of value,'' except where expresslypermitted by agency standards of conduct regulations, means any gift, favor,entertainment, hospitality, transportation, loan, or any other tangibleitem, and any intangible benefits, including discounts, passes, and promotionalvendor training, given or extended to or on behalf of Government personnel,their immediate families, or households, for which fair market value isnot paid by the recipient or the Government.(g) ``Participated personally and substantially'' means active and significantinvolvement of the individual in activities directly related to the procurement.To participate ``personally'' means directly, and includes the participationof a subordinate when actually directed by the supervisor in the matter.To participate ``substantially'' means that the employee's involvementmust be of significance to the matter. It requires more than official responsibility,knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrativeor peripheral issue. A finding of substantiality should be based not onlyon the effort devoted to a matter, but on the importance of the effort.While a series of peripheral involvements may be insubstantial, the singleact of approving or participating in a critical step may be substantial.An employee whose responsibility is the review of a procurement solelyfor compliance with administrative procedures or budgetary considerations,and who reviews a document involved in the procurement for such a purpose,should not be regarded as having participated substantially in the procurement.(h)(1) ``Procurement official'' means any civilian or military officialor employee of an agency who has participated personally and substantiallyin the conduct of the agency procurement concerned, including all officialsand employees who are responsible for reviewing or approving the procurement.(2) ``Procurement official'' includes any civilian or military officialor employee of an agency who has participated personally and substantiallyin the following activities_   (i) Development of acquisition plans;   (ii) Development of specifications, statements of work, or purchase descriptions/requests;  (iii) Development of solicitation or contractual provisions;   (iv) Evaluation or selection of a contractor; or   (v) Negotiation or award of a contract or modification to a contract.  (3) For purposes of 3.104-4 (h)(1) and (h)(2), the term ``employee of anagency'' includes a contractor, subcontractor, consultant, expert, or advisor(other than a competing contractor) acting on behalf of, or providing adviceto, the agency with respect to any phase of the agency procurement concerned.  (i) ``Property'' means supplies as defined at 2.101.

The prohibition in subsection27(b)(1) of the Act does not apply after a Government official or employeeleaves Government service. Subsection 27(b)(1) of the Act also appliesto consultants who have become procurement officials until such individualceases to act on behalf of, or provide advice to, the procuring agency.(b) Subsection 27(d)(4) of the Act provides that if a procurement officialleaves the Government during the conduct of a procurement expected to resultin a contract or modification in excess of $100,000, such official shallcertify to the contracting officer that he or she understands the continuingobligation, during the conduct of the procurement, not to disclose proprietaryor source selection information related to such agency procurement. (c) Subsection 27(e)(1) of the Act prohibits a former Government officialor employee who has participated personally and substantially in the conductof a Federal agency procurement or has personally reviewed and approvedthe award or modification of any contract for such procurement from participatingin any manner in negotiations as an officer, employee, representative,agent or consultant of a competing contractor leading to the award or modificationof the contract for such procurement. This restriction not only includesrepresenting the competing contractor in negotiations but also includesproviding advice or information on negotiation strategies. For purposesof the restriction, negotiation strategy is the contractor's approach tothe preparation and presentation of its offer and conduct of negotiationswith the Government. The restriction does not apply to providing scientific,technical, or other advice that is unrelated to negotiation strategies.The restriction only applies when, the advice or information is providedto the competing contractor for the specific purpose of influencing negotiationsleading to the award or modification of the contract. This restrictionlasts for 2 years from the date of the individual's last personal and substantialparticipation in the Federal agency procurement. (d) Subsection 27(e)(2) of the Act prohibits a former Government officialor employee who has participated personally and substantially in the conductof a Federal agency procurement or who has personally reviewed and approvedthe award or modification of any contract for such procurement from participatingpersonally and substantially on behalf of the competing contractor in performanceof the contract. Generally, what constitutes personal and substantial participationon behalf of the competing contractor must be determined on a case-by-casebasis. To participate ``personally and substantially'' requires the presenceof both direct and significant involvement in performance of the specificcontract. This restriction lasts for 2 years from the date of the lastpersonal and substantial participation in the Federal agency procurement.<ITAG tagnum="80">3.104-7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Identification of the beginning of the conduct of a Federal agencyprocurement. </ITAG>The conduct of a Federal agency procurement begins when an authorized agencyofficial determines that a specific agency need or requirement shall besatisfied by procurement.

However, certain conduct and activities that are prohibitedby the Act would be inappropriate at any time. It is generally recognizedthat potential contractors should not offer, and agency officials shouldnot solicit gratuities at any time. Similarly, potential contractors shouldnot solicit, and agency personnel should not offer, proprietary or sourceselection information at any time. However, potential contractors may offer,and Government employees may solicit, employment except as prohibited bylaw. Contractors who wish to discuss employment opportunities with a possibleprocurement official should ask if that party is a procurement officialfor a procurement for which the contractor is a competing contractor beforeconducting any discussion related to employment. Similarly, procurementofficials who wish to solicit employment from a potential competing contractorshould ask whether the contractor is reasonably likely to become a competingcontractor on any procurement for which the procurement official is responsible.(b) Agency personnel shall be presumed to know the procurements for whichthey are procurement officials. Contractor personnel are presumed to knowthe procurement for which the organization they represent is reasonablylikely to be competing. Individuals who do not, in fact, know whether theyare procurement officials, or whether the organization they represent isa competing contractor, should defer any discussions regarding employmentuntil these questions can be resolved by consulting appropriate partieswithin their respective organizations. (c) A competing contractor shall not be considered to have knowingly violatedthe prohibitions set forth in subsection 27(a)(1) of the Act (see 3.104-3(a)(1))if the contractor has made an inquiry in good faith of the possible procurementofficial and has been advised that the individual is not a procurementofficial for any procurement for which the contractor is a competing contractor.Similarly, a procurement official shall not be considered to have knowinglyviolated the prohibitions set forth in subsection 27(b)(1) of the Act (see3.104-3(b)(1)) if the procurement official made inquiry in good faith ofthe potential contractor, and had been advised that the contractor wouldnot be a competing contractor on a procurement under the responsibilityof the procurement official. (d) A competing contractor or procurement official shall not be consideredto have knowingly violated the prohibitions in subsection 27(a)(3) or 27(b)(3)of the Act (see 3.104-3 (a)(3) and (b)(3)) if, before proprietary or sourceselection information was solicited, obtained, or disclosed, the contractoror procurement official_ (1) Had made an inquiry in good faith of the appropriate competing contractoror procurement official regarding whether information was proprietary orsource selection information; and (2) Had been advised by such official that the information was not proprietaryor source selection information. <ITAG tagnum="80">3.104-9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Certification requirements. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicability. </T3>In accordance with subsection 27(d)(7)(A) of theAct, certification requirements set forth herein apply to contracts inexcess of $100,000 awarded by a Federal agency on or after May 16, 1989,and to any contract modification in excess of $100,000 executed by a Federalagency on or after May 16, 1989, except as provided in 3.104-9(e).
