Doggette Jr., SSA's deputy commissioner ofoperations, GAO's Information Management and Technology Division said thatthough the agency has used a software measurement package to identifyproblems, it has not issued guidance for using the results to improvequality.andM;The package SSA used, PathVu, an automated software measurement tool fromPeat Marwick Main andamp; Co., Montvale, N.J., revealed that 1,992 of the 2,441retirement system programs checked did not meet SSA's quality standards forbatch programs.andM;The tool also found that most programs were organized poorly and containedcomplex logic.andP;  Those weaknesses could make the programs difficult tounderstand and could increase maintenance time and costs, the report said.andM;The GAO report focused on the batch computer programs supporting SSA'sRetirement, Survivors and Disability Insurance Benefit system.andM;SSA bought the PathVu package to help its managers and programmers determinewhether programming standards were applied and followed and to help determinethe effects of software maintenance.andP;  The package produces data on thesoftware's condition, and users who periodically apply the package to reviewthe same programs may determine whether maintenance has affected theprograms' quality.andM;GAO auditors said they chose the retirement system's batch programs for threereasons.andP;  First, the programs are important to SSA's processing millions ofretirement checks.andP;  Last year, these batch programs processed about $215billion worth of retirement checks for more than 38 million people.andM;Second, GAO noted the program's poor quality, and third, the report notedthat SSA does not plan to replace the software until the mid-1990s.andP;  &quot;Becauseof this delay, SSA must maintain and improve its current batch programs,&quot; thereport said.andM;Lack of GuidanceandM;While the package has done its part, SSA has not issued any written guidanceto ensure that the package and its results are used consistently by itsmanagers and programmers, the report said.andM;In response, SSa officials said the agency has included the goal of improvingthese programs within the merit pay contracts of officials responsible forthem, rather than providing specific written guidance.andM;&quot;Including improvement goals in merit pay should result in better andincreased usage of the package and its results.andP;  However, in out opinion,developing specific written guidance offers the agency a better opportunityto consistently use the package to improve the agency's batch programs,&quot; thereport said.andM;In addition, the report said that SSA did not have a complete inventory ofits batch programs and that during maintenance, SSA programmers had changedthe names of several of the batch programs.andP;  Because the PathVu toolidentifies programs by name, this could be detrimental, the report said.andM;SSA plans to acquire an automated package to help identify and monitormultiple names given to the same program, it added.andM;SSA officials generally agreed with the report's contents, except therecommendation to develop specific written guidance, said Frank Battistelli,an SSA spokesman.andM;Resisting 'Policing'andM;SSa officials said they preferred not to issue specific guidance on using thepackage's results because they wanted their managers and programmers tobecome familiar with the package and its benefits on their own.andP;  They did notwant their staff to feel &quot;policed&quot; by the package, the report said.andM;The agency has begun a two-phase approach to improve its situation, thereport said.andP;  First, the agency will develop complete information on all ofits batch programs to be able to measure quality over time.andM;Second, SSA is developing rules for naming batch programs for the entire theagency.andP;  Users then can correlate and compare original program measurementswith later measurements.andP;  SSA expects the new standard to be in place bySeptember.andM;The auditors did complement SSA on its maintenance, saying the agency &quot;hasmade positive efforts to improve the maintainability and quality of its batchprograms until redesignated programs can be installed.&quot;andM;&quot;Time will tell,&quot; said Melroy D. Quasney, associate director of IMTEC.andO;&quot;They've made some progress already, as we have determined from our follow-upmeeting with the agency.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
