A Pakistani Defense Ministry spokesman in Islamabad said hecould not confirm the report, but added: ``It's a commonoccurrence, the exchange of fire along this border.''   P.C. Dogra, commander of the Border Security Force, said therewere no casualties on the Indian side. He said the initial skirmishin the Ramgarh sector of Jammu-Kashmir state, along the northernborder, began Friday when Pakistani soldiers fired on Indian troopsbuilding the road.   Rice paddies spread into both countries along that stretch ofborder, which is dotted with bunkers of the two armies.   ``Now, no one is allowed to go within 100 meters of the border,not even the farmers who plow their fields up to the last inch ofthe Indian land during normal times,'' Dogra said.   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since the subcontinentbecame independent of Britain in 1947. Two of the wars, in 1965 and1971, were over border disputes in Jammu-Kashmir state that stillare unresolved.   Pakistan claims part of the state and the disputed territorybegins about 30 miles north of Ramgarh, where the road is beingbuilt.   Residents said about 100 families totaling more than 700 peoplehad left the area since the shooting began.   Dhoru Ram of Dagh village said he sent his family to Jammu, 20miles to the north, after his hut came under fire Sunday and hiswater buffalo was killed.   ``I will stay here as long as my fields are here,'' he said.   A bus driver named Bitta said he had not seen ``such fright andpanic among the people of the area'' since the 1971 war.   Bitta said he had made several trips from Dagh and neighboringNarayanpur village, transporting ``panicky families'' to theinterior. He said about 100 families had left.   A state government spokesman, who cannot be identified underbriefing rules, said the people of all 25 villages in the sectorwould be moved to safer areas if a serious conflict with Pakistanbegan.   He said under the contingency plan, each family would be given10,000 rupees ($606), and free food and accommodation in schoolsand government buildings elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
