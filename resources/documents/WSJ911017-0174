A new study of global stock markets by Salomon BrothersInternational Ltd., a London unit of Salomon Inc., says that1990 and 1991 &quot;may come to be seen as watershed years&quot; in theworld's stock markets.</LP><TEXT>   Americans are awakening to the benefits -- and risks -- ofinvesting abroad, while an easing of capital constraints andother regulations on the European continent are making iteasier for institutions there to invest outside their owncountries.   Meanwhile, &quot;a stable pound and already large diversifiedportfolios are prompting U.K. institutions to pull back fromoverseas' investing, especially in Europe,&quot; says MichaelHowell, research director at Salomon Brothers in London.&quot;Japanese investors -- battered by the collapse of the Tokyostock market in 1990 -- have also greatly reduced theirappetite for foreign stocks.&quot;   Overall, Salomon Brothers predicts that cross-border stocktrading -- investors in one country buying stocks in another-- will continue to grow. But the firm predicts that suchactivity will fluctuate a lot from year to year.   U.S. investors will purchase a net $26.3 billion offoreign stocks this year, more than twice the net purchaseslast year, according to the Salomon study. The firm alsoprojects that continental European investors will add $16.1billion of foreign stocks to their portfolios in 1991, upfrom $3.8 billion in 1990.   Meanwhile, the Japanese and British, who together investeda net $47.7 billion into overseas stock markets in 1989 areprojected to buy a mere net $3.2 billion this year, even lessthan the $5.5 billion they bought in 1990.   &quot;You're seeing continued diversification. The peopleinvesting overseas now aren't the ones who were doing it afew years ago,&quot; says Mr. Howell.   U.S. investors' appetite for foreign shares is ravenous.From 1986 through 1988, they purchased a net $700 million offoreign stocks. But from 1989 through 1991, &quot;we estimate theywill buy nearly $60 billion,&quot; says Mr. Howell. &quot;That's aphenomenal jump.&quot;   Traditionally parochial investors -- only $93 billion, orroughly 4%, of all U.S. pension assets are invested inforeign securities -- Americans are coming to accept theargument that diversification reduces risk and increasesreturn. (Excluding Swiss banks, continental Europeaninstitutional investors have less than 3.5% of their assetsin foreign equities, according to Salomon.)   &quot;What we're seeing, at least in 1991, is somebottom-fishing,&quot; says David Strongin, director ofinternational finance at the Securities Industry Association,a trade group. &quot;U.S. investors are putting record amountsinto Japanese stocks.&quot;   He points out that during the 1980s, Japan became one ofthe largest equity markets in the world, and in 1989, thelargest. &quot;But while the Tokyo market was growing in the1980s, U.S. investors were actually net sellers of Japaneseequities over the decade. They were substantiallyunderweighted in Japanese equities in their portfolios.&quot; Headds: &quot;Given the {Japanese stock} price declines that beganin 1990, U.S. investors saw an opportunity to do somebuying.&quot;   Added to this, says Mr. Strongin, is that &quot;1991 has been afavorable environment for stocks world-wide: Interest rateshave been falling and investors see the beginnings of aglobal economic rebound.&quot;   Gary Bergstrom, president and chief investment officer ofAcadian Asset Management Inc., a Boston money managementfirm, says: &quot;We're seeing a lot of interest on the part ofU.S. institutions to increase the international portions oftheir equity portfolios.&quot;   So far this year, the U.S. and Japanese stock markets havebeen the biggest recipients of foreign cash. &quot;You've had over$30 billion of foreign money flowing into Japanese equitiesin anticipation of lower interest rates which are now areality,&quot; says Salomon's Mr. Howell. &quot;Similarly, large fundshave been switched into the U.S. stock market,&quot; an estimatednet $14.2 billion by year end.   That's the reverse of last year, when internationalinvestors unloaded a net $15.1 billion of U.S. shares and anet $13.3 billion of Japanese shares, but purchased $15.5billion of continental European stocks and $19 billion insmaller stock markets elsewhere.   &quot;Money followed the economic cycle, flowing into thosecountries that were still growing strongly and were distantfrom recession: continental Europe, the emerging Far Easternand Latin American markets,&quot; says Mr. Howell. The exceptionwas Japan, where stocks were hammered by rising domesticinterest rates.   Long-term, the Salomon study doubts U.S. stocks willcontinue to attract big chunks of foreign cash. Overseasinvestors already have large holdings of U.S. stocks. Inaddition, the report predicts that the planned economicunification of the 12-nation European Community, &quot;and theattractions of the emerging Latin American and Pacific Rimeconomies, may pull capital away from the U.S.&quot;   Money managers don't disagree. Although European investors&quot;are now looking more closely at Japan and the U.S., thosemarkets are not generally the major part of theirportfolios,&quot; says Michele Jardin, manager of theinternational equities division at Credit Lyonnais in Paris.&quot;People in Europe have been killed by the weak dollar forfive years; it takes time to rebuild confidence,&quot; she says.   Mr. Bergstrom of Acadian says that &quot;with the Standard andamp;Poor's {500-Stock Index} selling at 19 times historicalearnings and a little over two times&quot; book value (assetsminus liabilities), &quot;the U.S. market isn't terriblyattractive relative to a lot of other equity markets rightnow.&quot;   Mr. Bergstrom's favorites are Belgium, Italy, New Zealandand Spain. He also likes Japan. &quot;It's not our No. 1 market,but it's more attractive than it has been since the lastquarter of 1989,&quot; he says.   A large 63% of 99 British institutions managing #485billion ($827.9 billion) plan to increase their holdings ofJapanese stocks, according to a survey conducted for Britishbrokers Smith New Court Securities PLC by the GallupOrganization. That's up from 36% with similar plans a monthago. Meanwhile, 15% plan to reduce their portfolio of U.S.shares.   Overall, gross international stock trading increased 6.2%last year to $2.32 trillion from $2.18 trillion, measured inU.S. dollars. Actual cross-border activity fell 9.8%,depressed by the sharp drop in share prices associated withthe plunge in the Japanese market and Iraq's invasion ofKuwait.   In trading volume, cross-border activity actually rose15.4%. Meanwhile, cross-exchange trading -- investors buyingand selling shares outside of the stocks' home markets, suchas an American investor purchasing a European stock traded inthe U.S. -- leaped 50%.   International investing will continue to expand in the1990s, Salomon predicts. Propelling the trend will be acontinued desire for more diversification, marketderegulation, the increased use of derivative instrumentssuch as futures and options and bigger pension-fundinvestment pools fed by aging populations.   But the flows of capital into and out of world marketswill also be more volatile, largely because of the increaseduse of derivatives and money managers controlling bigger andbigger investment pools.   &quot;The people shifting the assets are a relatively new classof investors -- global asset allocators -- who one day willdecide to buy a part of France and the next month will shiftthose funds into Germany equities,&quot; says Salomon's Mr.Howell.   Adds Mr. Bergstrom of Acadian: &quot;The reality is thatincreasingly large institutions are looking at equity marketson a global basis&quot; and rapidly assessing &quot;the relativeattractiveness of individual markets.&quot; Acadian, for instance,has a computer model that tracks 20 world stock markets,eight international bond markets and eight major currenciesand cash markets.</TEXT></DOC>
