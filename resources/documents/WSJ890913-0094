Citing budgetary constraints and other factors, the administration said it has decided against seeking funds for a new U.S. &quot;tied-aid&quot; program.    Instead, the administration said it will recommend that available funds be used to help the U.S. gain leverage in the planned negotiations. And within budget constraints, it wants to increase financing for overseas construction projects involving U.S. companies, which have been losing business to foreign competitors.    Tied aid consists of grants or low-interest loans offered to foreign buyers by a country on the condition that the buyer uses the money to purchase goods from the aid-providing nation.    Japan, West European nations and Canada -- who together provide as much as 75% of all such aid for capital projects -- have used the device to win contracts to supply telecommunications, railways, electric power and other capital and infrastructure projects in developing nations. The U.S. accounts for only 2% of tied-aid credit for such projects.    Tied aid is a hot political issue, particularly because of the nation's continuing trade deficit. In 1988, the U.S. ran a $128 billion merchandise trade deficit. Because of the recent strengthening of the dollar, many economists fear the deficit could worsen in the coming months.    Last April, the Export-Import Bank estimated that U.S. exporters are losing hundreds of millions of dollars of potential exports every year because of tied-aid practices by other nations.    &quot;The administration hereby recommits itself to working with Congress to ensure that, to the maximum possible degree, competition in our export markets focuses on price, quality and service rather than on the availability of concessional financing,&quot; Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Export-Import Bank Chairman John Macomber said in a letter to Congress.    The Bush administration already has suggested that industrial nations agree to several modifications to current tied-aid practices. These include &quot;untying&quot; aid programs for capital projects so that recipients wouldn't be obliged to buy from donor countries but could use the aid to buy elsewhere, too. Other suggestions include limiting use of tied aid to particular sectors or markets and banning the introduction of tied-aid credits late in the process of bidding.    The negotiations on ending tied aid will be held under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based group of developed countries.    To back its negotiating strategy, the administration said it will use the Tied Aid Credit Fund, or &quot;war chest&quot; as it is known, more aggressively than in the past. The fund has been used since 1987 to encourage adherence to earlier agreements on tied credit. The administration proposes using it to provide tied aid in areas of specific interest to U.S. exporters where competitors also use tied credits. The Agency for International Development also will maximize its support for foreign capital projects, the administration said in its report to Congress.    The administration added that if &quot;sufficient progress isn't made toward achieving our negotiating objectives,&quot; it would retain the option of recommending that additional resources be devoted to the establishment of a U.S. tied-aid credit program. </TEXT></DOC>
