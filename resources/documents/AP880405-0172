The warnings have taken on special importance in the face oflast week's assassination in Paris of Dulcie September, arepresentative of the African National Congress which is fightingto topple the white minority South African government, theactivists say.   The ANC blamed the South African government for Ms. September'sshooting death but South Africa denied the allegation. Policesources in Paris said the killing appeared to be the work of aprofessional, and French President Francois Mitterrand said hewould ask South African authorities about the attack.   The Washington representative of the ANC, Dumi Matabani, said hewas contacted last September by FBI agents who told him they ``hada strong suspicion that a South African hit squad'' might be in theUnited States.   ``They said they would try and stop it, and told me to becareful,'' Matabani said. The FBI did not offer any protection but``they told me that if I was followed, I should take the car numberand call them,'' Matabani said.   An ANC representative in New York, Themba Ntinga, said hisoffice had also been warned by the FBI.   Nomonde Ngubo, a South African employee of the United MineWorkers in Washington and an anti-apartheid activist, said she toohad been contacted by the FBI several times in recent months.   Ngubo said the FBI agent had declined to discuss anything on thephone, and that her lawyer would probably be setting up anappointment soon for her to meet with representatives of the agency.   A spokesman for the FBI, Gregory Jones, declined to commentabout the activists' claims. But he added that ``any informationthat comes to the FBI's attention about possible loss of life orviolence, we're obliged to pass on to the interested party.''   In recent months South Africa has increased its attacks againstguerrillas of the ANC, mounting a cross-border raid into Botswanalast week and killing four people. Over the past few years ANCrepresentatives in Brussels, Mozambique and Zimbabwe have beentargeted for violent attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
