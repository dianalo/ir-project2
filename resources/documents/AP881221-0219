The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, shot up $1.42 on Tuesday to settle at $17.73 abarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had fallen 41 centsthe previous session.   One major trader who was caught short had to buy Januarycontracts on the final day to close out a position, said PeterBeutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.   Traders who are short have sold borrowed contracts as a bet thatthe price will fall, and they will be able to repay their debt withcontracts bought at the cheaper price.   But in a classic short squeeze Tuesday, the trader was forced topay exorbitant prices to get anyone to sell, said another trader,Jack Unger of Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.   There were conflicting reports about the identity of the traderor traders who were caught short. Any trader who is still short whenthe contract expires must make delivery of actual oil to the holderof the contract, something most oil traders are scarcely prepared todo.   Reflecting the unusual circumstances of the short squeeze,contracts for delivery in later months rose by far smaller amounts.The February contract rose 33 cents to $16.15 a barrel and the Marchcontract rose 32 cents to $15.75 a barrel.   Crude oil got some support from a report that the Saudis werecutting back their allocation of oil to Japan, forcing the Japaneseto buy oil elsewhere, Beutel said.   There also are some long-term reasons for an increase in oilprices, said James L. Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.   ``The OPEC agreement that was struck shortly before Thanksgivingwas met initially with a great amount of skepticism in the crudetrading community. But it's been accepted so far by all the cartelmembers to a degree that was not expected,'' Carroll said.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,January wholesale home heating oil rose 0.72 cent to 51.47 cents agallon.   The January contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 45.55 centsa gallon Tuesday, up 0.13 cent from the close Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
