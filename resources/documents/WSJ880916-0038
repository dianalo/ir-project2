They sped up the procedures.    &quot;The intensity of this storm -- 170-mile-per-hour winds and the whole gulf to generate power in -- got everyone's attention,&quot; said Bob Porter, who manages Du Pont Co.'s sprawling refinery at the upper end of Galveston Bay near here.    Then, even though the storm's intensity had diminished somewhat yesterday afternoon, Mr. Porter began bringing some equipment indoors and engaging a few other elements of Phase Three in Du Pont's massive hurricane-preparation plan -- even though, officially, the plant remained in Phase Two.    All across the Gulf Coast, businesses continued battening down the hatches. Some simply backed up their computer data. Others, such as Continental Airlines, faced such complex logistics as whether, where and when to pull airplanes out of Houston.    Some companies pondered the unknown: If Gilbert, now back over warm water, regains the strength it lost over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, no one knows whether satellite dishes, billboards and other untethered outdoor equipment will survive the record winds.    Already, residents and businesses of the U.S. Gulf Coast know how devastating the effects could be -- officials put Gilbert's damages to Jamaica at roughly $8 billion. The figure for Mexico is high and still rising as Gilbert swings back toward the northern part of that country.    But in the U.S., although Gilbert posed an unprecedented threat, it mostly engaged longstanding and well-practiced emergency procedures. &quot;This plant site has quite a bit of experience with hurricanes,&quot; Du Pont's Mr. Porter, a 50-year-old manufacturing supervisor, said. &quot;Over the years, we've developed fairly well-refined emergency procedures.&quot;    Five phases guide the plant's thousand workers through a hurricane, from monitoring weather reports to shutting down the plant, to sitting out the storm and starting things up again.    &quot;We started Phase One on Monday when the tropical storm that would become Hurricane Gilbert was named and seemed headed toward the gulf,&quot; Mr. Porter said. Phase One meant checking lots of calendars -- shipments arriving by barge or tank truck that might need to be stopped, manufacturing and maintenance scheduling that might need to be changed. Officially, the plant was still at Phase Two last night.    In Phase Two, &quot;we set up a specific weather information monitoring group to track the storm,&quot; the manager said. Early on, the plant relied on reports from the National Weather Service, but by the time it moved into Phase Two, it was buying additional weather services from commercial meteorology concerns.    &quot;Unpredictability makes it a most difficult thing to try to plan,&quot; Mr. Porter concedes, which is why often this week he has reached ahead to other phases, just to be safe. It's a delicate balancing act, full of &quot;judgment calls,&quot; Mr. Porter said. And the decision to shut the plant down or not rests solely on him. Many plant workers have taken him up on the offer to leave the plant to secure their homes and head for higher ground. Many have stayed.    For top managers at the Occidental Chemical Corp. plants on the Houston Ship Channel, Hurricane Gilbert has meant meetings every three hours. At the 3 p.m. meeting yesterday, managers were sticking with a decision not to shut down. &quot;We'll review data at 6 p.m. and again at 9 p.m.,&quot; said Joe D. Carona, manager of the Houston-area electrochemical plants.    But Mr. Carona said the Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit won't take any chances with the lives of the plants' workers or neighbors. The plants produce chlorine, caustic soda, chlorinated solvents and other commodity chemicals. &quot;We would not operate the plant if weather conditions meant we'd be impacted by wind or tide,&quot; Mr. Carona said.    At Exxon Corp.'s Exxon Pipeline Co. operations at Corpus Christi, Texas, there's not that much choice. With the latest projections putting Gilbert so near Corpus Christi, the oil pipeline's workers are scrambling to secure and waterproof facilities that include hundreds of miles of pipe and several pumping stations.    A spokesman for Exxon Pipeline said one of the things workers have to do is make sure &quot;storage tanks have ballast in them, a certain amount of oil so the tanks don't float in the event of high water.&quot; Although the storage tanks are anchored, the force of the water could be enough to dislodge an empty tank, he said.    But all the managers, including Mr. Porter at Du Pont, will weigh carefully the decision to close plants that mean money for their companies. Du Pont's La Porte plant near here runs &quot;year round, seven days a week, 24 hours a day,&quot; Mr. Porter says. Every day it's shut down means as many as 30 shipments of the chemical intermediates they produce for customers aren't shipped.    All the planning and attention to detail might save the U.S. Gulf Coast from some of the economic ruin visited on Jamaica and Mexico by Hurricane Gilbert. But the repercussions of the plant closings will still be costly and felt throughout all the manufacturing industries these plants produce materials for.    &quot;This is a big interruption to the economy and it will affect the petrochemical refining community enormously,&quot; Mr. Porter said. </TEXT></DOC>
