Gross domestic product measures a nation's output of goods and serivices, minus foreign income.    &quot;In 1986, the year in which it was expected that advances achieved during the present administration would be consolidated, the country faced the most unfavorable foreign economic situation of the last half century,&quot; the bank said in its annual report.    The fall in oil revenue and a lack of foreign credits were especially damaging, the bank said. But it added that output declined in all sectors of the economy except livestock and electricity production.    The average price for Mexican crude oil during 1986 was $11.80 a barrel, down 47% from a year earlier and well below the $23-a-barrel price that was used to compute the original 1986 economic plan, the report said. Exports of crude oil and petroleum products brought Mexico only $8.5 billion last year, down from $14.7 billion in 1985.    &quot;To appreciate the magnitude of this loss, think that it exceeds the contribution of all national agriculture to the gross domestic product,&quot; the bank said. </TEXT></DOC>
