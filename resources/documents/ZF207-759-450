 A typicalconfiguration might be a roughly 10-MIPS workstation with a 19-inchmonochrome monitor, 16MB of RAM and a local 100MB SCSI disk drive.andM;2 Actively court discounts.andP;  Often vendors will undercut list prices 20percent to 50 percent for key customers.andP;  Ask for volume, academic orfirst-time-buyer discounts.andP;  These discounts vary widely from vendor tovendor and can dramatically change price/performance ratios.andP;  Also check forhidden costs.andM;3 Ask for a loaner machine for a couple of weeks.andP;  This will allow you tocompile and run your software and judge the workstation's performance foryourself.andM;4 Don't buy more than you need, and avoid duplicate peripherals.andP;  Forexample, DEC's DS3100 usually comes preconfigured with a TK50 tape drive.andP;  Ifyou're buying 50 workstations to be networkd together, you probably don'tneed 50 tape drives--one should suffice.andM;The PC Threat?andM;Are increasingly powerful personal computers, such as those based on theIntel 80386 chip, serious competition for the workstation dollar?andM;The answer depends on the resources a user's applications require.andP;  An 80386machine running Unix can be had for about $7,000 and will run most Unixapplications with a speed of about 2 to 4 MIPS.andP;  However, it will probablynot run X windows in a usable fashion without special display hardware, whichcan jack the cost up by an additional $5,000.andM;Although X windows is available on an IBM PC Video Graphics Adapter-basedsubsystem, performance quickly degrades when multiple windows are opened, orwhen client applications as well as the X server are run on the PC.andP;  By thetime extra displays are added to these PCs, the price exceeds those of thenew low-end workstations from DEC and Sun, with well under half theperformance.andM;Although few traditional non-RISC-based personal computers can compete withthe raw performance power of RISC, they can run the excellent productivitysoftware that has made PCs so ubiquitous, such as word processing andspreadsheet packages.andM;Consequently, the decision to buy a personal computer and use it as aworkstation should depend on the user's need to run such traditional PCsoftware.andP;  If it is a requirement, then the worst price/performance offeredby non-RISC-based machines is offset by the enhanced productivity gained fromthe additional software capacity.andM;This decision is bound to become more difficult within the next year aspersonal computers based on the Intel 80486 and Motorola 68040 CPUs maketheir debuts.andM;Such machines should offer power comparable to today's RISC CPUs (10 to 15MIPS), in addition to the capacity to utilize their PC predecessors' largesoftware base.andP;  Also, as PC operating systems become more robust, thesemachines should allow multitasking, making them even more attractive toworkstation users.andM;In the meantime, buyers may find that for character-oriented applications notrequiring special hardware or high performance, the 80386-based machines canbe a win.andP;  But for graphics-oriented applications, the cost comparison stillleans toward workstations.andM;Workstations buyers have never had it better.andP;  New workstations are beingadded nearly every month to the abundance of products already available, andthe price/performance ratio seems to drop dramatically with each newintroduction.andP;  Analysts and vendors alike say no end is currently in sightfor the price drops and the performance boosts.andM;Because the workstation market is relatively young, no single vendor orproduct--even among the RISC-based workstations--dominates, and an incrediblydiverse group of products are called &quot;workstations.&quot;andP;  Buyers must thereforewade through a confusing cornucopia of goods.andM;Stand-alone engineering workstations do share some common characteristics,however.andP;  At their most basic, they support a single user at a largebit-mapped screen, have a built-in Ethernet port, run a multitaskingoperating system (typically 4.xBSD Unix, Unix System V or a derivativethereof), include a hard disk and standard networking software (usuallyTCP/IP), and support a windowing system such as X windows.andM;High-end systems, on the other hand, add specialized hardware such asgraphics accelerators or multiple CPUs that enhance performance manyfold.andO;Such additions are expensive, however.andP;  That's why the most dramatic drops inprice/performance ratios are currently occurring among low-end workstationproducts.andM;Despite the cutthroat competition that is driving performance and price wars,the workstation market couldn't be healthier.andP;  According to Vicki Brown, asenior analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.-basedconsulting company, workstations constituted a $4.5 billion market in theUnited States last year, which is projected to grow about 25 percent annuallythrough 1993.andM;In addition, there is significant movement toward standards that will enableworkstations from different vendors to share applications and communications.andO;Buyers should pay close attention to the emerging standards: They are thekeys to making sure the applications developed on today's workstations willrun on the even less expensive and more powerful workstations that willappear in the not-so-distant future.andM;The ability to run applications quickly for as low a price aspossible--called the price/performance ratio--is a principle selling pointfor workstations.andP;  Relatively new companies such as Silicon Graphics and SunMicrosystems have attracted buyers by offering minicomputer-level power at afraction of typical minicomputer prices.andP;  This trend has accelerated inrecent months.andM;During the past year, DEC, Data General, NeXT, Silicon Graphics and Sun haveintroduced workstations, with each debut trumpeting a new low figure for theprice per MIPS.andM;Silicon Graphics led the way by announcing the Personal Iris, which includesa proprietary graphics accelerator and uses Mips Computer Systems' R2000 RISCchip to provide 10-MIPS processing capability.andP;  When first introduced, theworkstation sold for $16,000.andM;Then last fall the NeXT machine appeared.andP;  Priced at $9,995, the workstationboasts a processing speed of 5 MIPS and includes a 10-MIPS digital signalprocessor.andM;In January, DEC announced the DECstation 3100, a 12-MIPS machine priced from$14,300 to $37,900 that runs under the Ultrix-32 operating system, and theVAXstation 3100, a 2.5-MIPS machine priced from $9,450 to $33,000 that runsunder VMS as well as Ultrix-32.andM;This was followed by Data General's announcement of its AV series ofworkstations, each using Motorola's 88000 RISC chip.andP;  The series' low-endmodel, the AV300, performs 17 MIPS for $7,450.andM;In April, Sun announced a series of products, the flagship of which is theSparcstation 1.andP;  Based on Sun's Sparc RISC chip, the workstation provides 10MIPS to 12.5 MIPS for $8,995.andM;In July, in a clear counter-punch to Sun's announcement, DEC introduced theDECstation 2100, which uses a slower version of the Mips Computer SystemsR2000 CPU to provide 10 MIPS and is priced from $10,350 to $33,950.andP;  Duringthe same month, Silicon Graphics lowered the Personal Iris price to $13,500.andM;Finally, this month IBM will announce new RISC-based workstations that willreportedly drop the dollar-per-MIPS ratio yet again, with a 25-MIPS machinegoing for about $10,000.andM;There are no indications that such price decreases will let up any time soon.andO;For example, machines based on Mips Computer Systems' chips currently sellfor about $1,000 per MIPS.andP;  According to John Hime, vice president andgeneral manager of the systems products group at Mips Computer Systems, &quot;bymid-1990, we will very likely be able to sell you $500 per MIPS, [and] thatwill double again by mid-1991, so that each MIPS [will cost] about $200 to$300.&quot;andM;STANDARD VARIETYandM;Workstation vendors are slowly but surely aiding in developing and complyingwith a variety of standards.andP;  This is good news for several reasons.andP;  First,standards make it easier to move mainframe and minicomputer applications toworkstation platforms.andP;  Second, they help workstation users share data andapplications with other computers, including workstations, in their network.andO;And third, they prevent today's workstations--and the applications developedon them--from becoming obsolete as new workstation products and technologiesemerge.andM;But the ideal of &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; workstation software, off-the-store-shelfapplications that any workstation can run, is far from being achieved.andO;Rather than trying to define a standard workstation platform that softwarevendors can target, which is what most buyers seem to want, vendors areinstead attempting to first achieve source-code compatibility.andP;  This wouldallow one set of source code to be recompiled on another vendor'sworkstations without significant modification.andM;&quot;Source-code compatibility is a lot easier to achieve, although we'd like togo to a binary standard,&quot; said Cheryl Vedo, director of product marketing atSun Microsystems.andM;There are many other aspects of the workstation world that remain untamed bystandardization.andP;  Even where standards initiatives are underway, vendors'efforts to enhance and distinguish their products often lead to disparitiesthat preclude true standardization--and that cloud the notion of what astandard really is.andM;Workstation operating systems provide one example of this tangle.andP;  Eachworkstation vendor can claim to run Unix, now considered the &quot;standard&quot;workstation operating system.andP;  But there is in fact little guarantee thatsoftware that runs under Berkeley Unix on one machine will even compile underother vendors' versions of Unix, such as DEC's Ultrix, Sun's SunOS, IBM's AIXor Hewlett-Packard's HP/UX.andM;Another example is the X windows system developed at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology.andP;  Intended to offer a portable, networked windowingsystem, X windows is fully supported by vendors such as DEC, IBM,Hewlett-Packard, Data General and high-end workstation vendor StellarComputer, and to a lesser extent, Apple, Intergraph, NeXT, Silicon Graphicsand Sun.andM;In theory, an application that runs under X windows on one workstation shouldbe able to display its output, with a similar or identical user interface, onany vendor's machine that supports X windows.andP;  This would make movingapplications between different vendors' machines more straightforward andeven allow applications to be ported from one architecture to another.andP;  Bothpersonal computers and Cray supercomputers should be able to run programswritten using X, for example.andM;To a surprising extent, this goal has been met.andP;  Software that runs under Xwindows can be compiled and run directly on machines from vendors such asSun, DEC and IBM without modification.andP;  This is about as close to&quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; software as the workstation market currently gets.andM;But there is a rub.andP;  Each vendor protects its market share by enhancing the Xwindows standard, usually by offering proprietary toolkits.andP;  Although thetoolkits enhance the workstation's productivity, their differences precludeeasy and immediate application portability.andM;MIT and other organizations belonging to the X Consortium, which is made upof over 50 computer companies and academic institutions, are working todefine additional windowing system standards.andP;  For example, one X Consortiumcommittee is developing the standard for the Phigs Extension to X, or PEX.andO;Phigs is a graphics programming standard that already provides someportability; including Phigs in X windows will take this portability one stepfurther.andM;This will be extremely helpful for buyers who are considering purchasingworkstations with graphics accelerators, an increasingly popular option amongbuyers whose applications are tied up by relatively slow display hardware.andM;Graphics accelerators are standard on many low-end workstations and arebecoming less expensive as options.andP;  Software subroutine calls to suchgraphics hardware are, at present, subject to few standards, so applicationsthat include such calls are rarely portable to another vendor's hardware.andM;PEX, however, will provide a standard, portable software interface tospecialized hardware such as graphics accelerators.andP;  Once PEX is defined andwidely implemented, workstation users will be able to move not only routinewindow applications but also sophisticated graphics programs between variousworkstations.andM;Other emerging workstation standards include Sun's Network File System (NFS),SCSI for disk drives.andP;  TCP/IP networking support on Ethernet, and the Cprogramming language and its standard libraries.andM;Despite all the standards activity, no standards have emerged yet that aredefined and implemented identically across the workstation market.andP;  Softwaredevelopers continue to develop applications &quot;for the machine with the most[sales] volume,&quot; said Dave Korus, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody, a NewYork brokerage house.andP;  Because no vendor owns more than a third of theworkstation market, however, even that strategy stymies the quest for adominant workstation application platform--at least for now.andM;The increasing role of third-party workstations in markets traditionallydominated by VAXes has put DEC on the offensive.andP;  DEC currently offers RISCworkstations that are at least as good in terms of price/performance as anythird-party workstations, and often better.andM;First, by introducing the DECstation 3100 and then the 2100, each of whichuses the Mips R2000 RISC chip, DEC has shown its commitment to Mips ComputerSystems' RISC architecture.andP;  In addition, buyers report that DEC is veryaggressive in discounting these workstations, sometimes by as much as 50percent, to land key accounts.andP;  Such discounts make DEC workstationprice/performance ratios extremely competitive.andM;DEC has also helped launch or support emerging standards.andP;  Besides being amajor force behind the development of X windows (which DEC offers withDEC-specific enhancements under the name DECwindows).andP;  DEC's workstations usethe TCP/IP networking protocol (in addition to DECnet).andM;Moreover, DEC already sells its VMS-based 3520 and 3540 workstations withsoftware based on a preliminary version of PEX under DECwindows.andP;  Accordingto Jake Vannoy, program architect for DECwindows, DEC will includefull-fledged support for PEX on all DEC workstations as the standard becomesavailable.andM;DEC's combination of excellent price/performance offerings and support forindustry standards bodes well for buyers of stand-alone DEC machines.andP;  DECworkstations offer some of the best hardware values available and don't limitusers with architecture-specific features that could lead to unportableapplications.andP;  This amounts to a big step toward &quot;shrink-wrap&quot; applications.andM;BUY NOW, PLAY LATER?andM;In light of the price reductions and new performance levels, buyers must askthemselves one crucial question: Should I buy now, or wait six months when Imay get twice the MIPS for my money?andM;Buyers who need workstations right away have no choice.andP;  But so what?andO;Workstation prices have never been better.andP;  What buyers can purchase todayfor $15,000 could not have been had last year for $30,000.andP;  Although thistrend is likely to continue during the next year, there are unprecedentedworkstation values to be had today.andM;Increased workstation standardization has also increased the incentive to buynow.andP;  For example, 12 months ago it wasn't all clear which windowing systemwould gain standard status.andP;  Now, a buyer seeking a Unix box that runs Xwindows can feel fairly comfortable that applications developed on thatmachine will be supported by new workstations appearing in two or five years.andM;Although standards such as PEX are still being hammered out, enough standardsare in place to let buyers feel confident that they won't be stuck with alemon tommorrow by buying one of today's machines.andM;Those who argue fro postponing the buying decision anticipate a very brightworkstation future.andP;  They note that the trend of increasing performance anddecreasing prices is likely to continue.andM;IBM, for instance, is already widely rumored to have some very powerful RISCmachines in the wings that will again lower the price/performance ratio.andM;Market analysts also predict that machines based on Motorola's 88000 chipwill affect the price/performance barrier and grab a significant marketshare.andP;  Data General has already announced prices as low as $500 per MIPS forsuch machines.andP;  Moreover, many buyers are eagerly awaiting new products as aresult of the recent Hewlett-Packard/Apollo merger.andP;  So far, the companieshave merely indicated they will introduce a new RISC system later this year.andM;Impressive new products may also grow out of the merger of former graphicssuper-computer rivals Ardent Computer and Stellar Computer.andP;  The new company,to be called Stardent, is expected to be officially incorporated late thismonth.andP;  According to Stellar founder Bill Poduska, the two companies willcombine their product lines and expect to achieve full compatibility witheach other's workstations by 1991.andM;Purchasers of workstations thus face a happy quandary.andP;  It's a win-winsituation.andP;  Waiting is advisable if buyers aren't in a rush, and if they are,no problem: As long as a workstation bought today supports the standardscurrently beign adopted throughout the workstation industry, it won't be leftbehind in the future.andP;  And the workstation future look good indeed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
