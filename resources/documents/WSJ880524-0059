Western Union said the business, which has less than $150 million a year in revenue, is too small to compete with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., which dominates the $50 billion-a-year market. The charge accounts for a write-down of facilities and the cost of employee severance plans.    The telecommunications concern said it had a $625.2 million net loss in the quarter, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $18.8 million. Western Union said it had a $22 million loss from operations in the latest quarter, which doesn't reflect savings from the write-down or work force reductions. Revenue rose 15% to $234.6 million from $204.6 million.    Robert J. Amman, president and chief executive officer, said the long-distance business doesn't fit Western Union's business plan following its financial restructuring last year. &quot;We don't want to be in a business where we are a very small player in a large market,&quot; Mr. Amman said. &quot;How can we possibly have the same cost structure as ATandamp;T? There's no way we can compete with ATandamp;T and expect to be profitable.&quot;    Western Union said it wrote down the value of its microwave transmission, voice-switching and related facilities, which it hopes to sell along with a customer base of a few hundred businesses and 7,000 residences. The charges also include severance and pension expenses related to the plan announced in April to cut its work force 25%, or by more than 1,800 employees.    Mr. Amman said instead of using its own lines for its electronic mail and related services, Western Union plans to lease lines connecting its data switches. Depending on negotiations with potential buyers, Western Union may route its traffic over the buyer's facilities, adding an additional $100 million in revenue to any possible deal, Mr. Amman said. Obvious buyers, he said, include other long-distance companies. He said no negotiations have occurred.    Mr. Amman also said, &quot;During the next few months, we will explore ways to further streamline the company's operations.&quot; Investor Bennett S. LeBow took control of Western Union late last year, and said then that he planned to sharply trim the company's business as part of an ambitious financial restructuring.    Mr. Amman said the new investors have been surprised at the accelerated decline in demand for telex services, which provide a big chunk of the company's profit and revenue. Because of competition with facsimile transmission, telex traffic is decreasing at a rate of about 20% currently, twice the rate of last fall. &quot;It's putting pressure on us to provide new services faster than we otherwise envisioned,&quot; Mr. Amman said.    For 1987, the company had an operating loss of $47.5 million before extraordinary gains of $152.8 million from extinguishment of debt.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Western Union closed at $3, down 12.5 cents.    Excluding long distance, Western Union's businesses include mailgram, telegram, electronic mail, money transfer and construction of fiber optic routes. Mr. Amman said the company is studying ways to use 2,000 miles of conduit under the downtowns of 85 cities to compete with local phone companies. </TEXT></DOC>
