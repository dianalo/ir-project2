(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Even in Loma, a tiny dot of a town near thebanks of the Missouri River, they found Jesse Murabito and took herchildren away.   Even after eight months of hiding and thousands of miles on the``underground railway'' when she was starting to hope for a newlife, the legal system that she profoundly distrusts caught up withher.   ``All I wanted to do is keep my children safe,'' a sobbing Mrs.Murabito said Saturday. ``The courts won't do it.''   ``I don't know what I'll do now,'' she said.   She fled New Hampshire in November with her 4-year-old son and6-year-old daughter after a jury acquitted her ex-husband, MarkRussell Murabito, of sexually molesting the daughter.   A secret network that helps women in such situations spiritedher first to the South, then to a battered women's shelter in SanFrancisco for three months and finally, in April, to Loma.   ``They said they could get me to Alaska or to Loma, and I justcouldn't face Alaska,'' Mrs. Murabito, 40, recalled in an interviewwith The Associated Press. ``They said they could guarantee me theywouldn't find me in Alaska, but ...''   On Friday afternoon, Chouteau County Sheriff Paul Williams, adeputy and social worker Diann Button appeared at her front doorwith a court order.   ``That social worker said the children were confused,'' Mrs.Murabito said, weeping and burying her face in her hands. ``Theyweren't confused, they were terrified.''   Williams said he learned earlier last week that Mrs. Murabitomight be living in the area when a local resident recognized herpicture from an article in a magazine.   As for the children's reaction to the arrival of the officialsFriday, he said, they became upset only when their mother did.   ``The children weren't bad until she started screaming andhollering and saying, `You're not taking my children! You're nottaking my children!''' the sheriff said.   The children have been placed in a foster home and a hearing isscheduled Thursday. Mrs. Murabito was not taken into custody;Williams said the civil warrant pending in New Hampshire could notbe enforced in Montana.   Mrs. Murabito was jailed for a week in February 1987 during thecouple's bitter divorce in New Hampshire for refusing to tell ajudge the whereabouts of her children.   Murabito, 34, was indicted in March 1988 on charges of sexuallyabusing the daughter, but he was acquitted in November.   A Superior Court judge in New Hampshire then stripped her of thechildren's custody, awarding Murabito joint custody with the state.Mrs. Murabito disappeared the same day with the children.   Kellett, a lawyer for Murabito, said Friday night that hisclient was ``very relieved and happy at the prospects of gettingthe children back'' and planned to attend the hearing Thursday.   Mrs. Murabito would not be specific about her flight from NewHampshire, saying she wanted to protect the people who helped her.She said she never knew full names of any contacts in theunderground network, nor whether the names she was given were real.   Williams said his initial investigation shows she traveled in atleast six states, including Missouri and Ohio.   Mrs. Murabito said that during her three months in the SanFrancisco shelter, a therapist worked with her daughter and maycome to Montana to testify at Thursday's hearing.   Mrs. Murabito was vague about why she was sent to Loma, a townof about 80 people in the wheatfields and rangeland ofnorth-central Montana.   Using the name Pat Gibeau, she said, she rented a small two-roomhouse on a dirt street and has worked since April at the Loma Cafeand Motel.   She said she quit her job Friday night and has contacted anattorney through Nashua Rape and Assault Services, which has aidedher since 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
