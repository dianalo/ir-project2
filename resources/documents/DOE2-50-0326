Duringthat period the capability and accuracy of calculational methods havebeen enormously improved. The microscopic cross sections needed as inputto the theoretical computations are now also known to adequate accuracy(with certain exceptions). Nonetheless, there remain substantial classesof shielding problems not yet accessible to satisfactory computationalmethods, particularly where three-dimensional geometries are involved.This paper discusses promising avenues to approach such problems, especiallyin the light of recent and expected advances in supercomputers. In particular,it seems that Monte Carlo methods should be much more advantageous inthe new computer environment than they have been in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
