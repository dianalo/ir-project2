Creates    A Chip That's Brainier    COMPUTERS ARE brilliant at calculating, but even the most powerful ones are tied in knots by things an infant can do easily, such as distinguishing between two voices.    A solution to computers' pattern-recognition problems may lie in neural nets, thousands of tiny connections modeled on the workings of the brain. Up to this point, however, neural-net enthusiasts have lacked adequate hardware.    Those days could be over. Intel Corp., which produced the first microprocessor in the 1970s, has built the first neural chip powerful enough for an entire computer. The company says the chip can perform 10,000 separate multiplications simultaneously and a total of two billion per second. That's more than some multimillion-dollar supercomputers can do.    Intel's chip uses a type of memory known as non-volatile, which means it doesn't lose its &quot;brains&quot; when the electricity gets turned off. That, plus its computing power, gives the chip a brain-like ability to compare, contrast and store patterns. Like most five-year-olds, &quot;it can easily recognize all the letters of the alphabet,&quot; says Mark Holler, the neural chip's chief architect.    Intel says it isn't ready to market the chip, or guess at its price. But the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker is evaluating potential uses with a number of customers and already has provided a small quantity of the chips to the U.S. Navy.    Navy researchers, who helped with the chip's design, are studying its use in a number of classified, non-nuclear weapons systems; they also have built a computer that will have the chip at its heart. The chip could, among other things, improve a missile's ability to hit targets.    CDs to Store Data Are    Music to Auditors' Ears BURIED UNDER books, auditors at some accounting firms are increasingly being drawn to compact disks for computer storage.    The use of compact disks for information storage has caught on well with libraries, but so far business has been cool to adopt this much-ballyhooed technology.    Now, though, CD storage is receiving a boost from auditors, who are beginning to trade in their fat volumes of tax and auditing rules for slim compact-disk players. The disks are the same as those used for music, but contain data rather than sound. The &quot;player&quot; is also different. Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. started the trend late last year, and already has outfitted 1,200 audit teams with CD players. This month, Price Waterhouse expects to begin distributing 1,000 CD players to auditors.    &quot;With the proliferation of literature in the accounting area, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find citations and be sure your research is complete,&quot; says Arthur Siegel, vice chairman of accounting and auditing services at Price Waterhouse. &quot;CD is an ideal solution.&quot;    Mr. Siegel thinks Price ultimately will buy another 3,000 CD players. Meanwhile, several other big accounting firms are expected to begin experimenting with the use of CDs for auditors, says Robert P. Rainier, director of publications for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.    CD storage has its drawbacks, however. Indexing of audit materials, which come from various sources, remains time consuming and isn't foolproof. And to keep abreast of new rulings, accounting firms must distribute fresh disks to auditors as frequently as every three months.    New Software Invites    Designers Into Designs    JUST A FEW YEARS ago, many engineers thought it a big deal to trade in pencils and paper for computers that enabled them to design on a desk-top screen. With computers, they could tinker, test and perfect work on screens before costly prototyping. What's more, the fancy systems showed animated designs in three dimensions.    Now, Autodesk Inc. of Sausalito, Calif., is betting that engineers will want to go further -- getting inside the design itself.    Autodesk, which sells software used by mechanical designers, began work in June on a product that creates a design netherworld called &quot;hyperspace.&quot; When coupled with a high-powered computer and special electronic eyeglasses and gloves, the software gives, say, an architect the impression that he's walking inside the building he's designing.    &quot;This gives (architects and designers) the power to build an environment, explore it and maybe do some designing on the fly,&quot; says William Bricken, director of Autodesk's research laboratory. &quot;He definitely has the feeling of going somewhere and coming back.&quot;    How quickly the company's hyperspace software hits the market depends on prices for the required hardware falling sharply. Right now, the cost of the helmet and glove exceeds $100,000.    Odds and Ends    BLACK BACKGROUNDS on computer displays may hinder productivity, according to new research by James Sheedy, a clinical associate professor at the University of California's Berkeley School of Optometry. Mr. Sheedy, the author of numerous studies on computer displays, reports that users perform 8% faster on screens that have black characters on a white background, compared with white on black. . . . Keeping needles clean: Varian Associates Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., has developed a new way of sterilizing syringes, surgical tubing and other medical disposables using an electron beam. The company says its new MegaRay product kills microorganisms without leaving a harmful residue, unlike conventional irradiation methods. </TEXT></DOC>
