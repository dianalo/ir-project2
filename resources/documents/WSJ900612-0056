The debate heats up as Congress moves to enact a majorcleanup bill. The United Mine Workers sees lost jobs inhigh-sulfur coal areas, and steelmakers say the tough Senatebill could cost 25,000 jobs in closing most coke ovens by2020. &quot;We would be exporting pollution and the jobs&quot; bybuying coke abroad, says Bethlehem Steel. Chrysler seeseventual harm to employment.</LP><TEXT>   But the work required to reduce acid rain will add 30,000jobs, says Pure Air, an Allentown, Pa., firm involved in ajoint Indiana venture. Use of more coal-consuming ethanolcould add 2,000 jobs, says the Renewable Fuels Association.Westmoreland Coal and Walker Manufacturing may add jobs, forlow-sulfur coal and auto catalytic-converter production.   Michael Silverstein, who edits an environmental-investingdirectory, says the bill moves work from polluters to&quot;polluter cleaner-uppers.&quot;                                                                                                          HAPPY FATHER'S DAY. Now help out around the house, please.   Fully 86% of women and 84% of girls in a poll by WorkingMother magazine and Walt Disney's Epcot Center say Dad,breadwinner or not, should help with household chores andchild rearing; 69% of men and 64% of boys agreed. &quot;America'sview of a father's role . . . has shifted dramatically,&quot; sayssocial psychologist Carin Rubenstein, on the poll of 2,962adults and children.   Two-thirds of the women and 55% of men said the sexes canequally raise children. Only 38% of the boys believe womenare as good as men at disciplining; 67% of girls think so.Dad doesn't do more with his children because he works hard,say 33% of men, 36% of boys, and 24% of women and girls. Morewomen than men say he just doesn't want to get involved.                                                                                                          GIVE WORKERS MORE SAY, and they'll do more.   That's a key message of a report due next week by a35-member Commission on the Skills of the American WorkForce. The study of 400 employers will urge reorganizing work-- to emphasize teamwork, rigorous training and high skills,to be more competitive with foreign nations. But most U.S.firms opt for a doomed low-wage, rapid-turnover strategy,says Ira Magaziner, the panel's chairman.   Governments must require high-schoolers to meet firmeducational standards and train non-college graduates betterfor job demands, says business strategist Magaziner. &quot;Thesituation will get worse&quot; without action, adds former LaborSecretary Ray Marshall, a commission co-chairman.   Teamwork urged by the panel would often be deemed cheatingin the classroom, says Bill Brock, also a panel chief andformer labor secretary.                                                                                                          JUSTICE DEPARTMENT sides with female workers and the AutoWorkers union, challenging a Johnson Controls &quot;fetalprotection&quot; policy that bars women of childbearing age fromjobs exposing them to lead. In a Supreme Court brief, thedepartment said Johnson didn't provide strong reasons forfertility-based discrimination.                                                                                                          A SIMPLE BINGO GAME it wasn't, the feds say, as a grandjury indicts six former or current Steelworkers unionofficials, five bingo-game operators and a Catholic priest,in Gary, Ind., for violations including illegal gambling andembezzling union funds. The Labor Department's inspectorgeneral and the IRS had investigated.                                                                                                          WORKERS URGED to strike last week in East Germany byretail, restaurant and other business groups respondedmildly, with walkouts of only about an hour. The businessesare concerned that western competitors will grab big parts oftheir market after the two German states move in July towardmerging economies.                                                                                                          IMMIGRANT NURSES involved in a strike against the KaiserPermanente Health Plan in Los Angeles won't be deported, theImmigration and Naturalization Service said. The ServiceEmployees union had sued, after the INS ruled in January thatH-1, or temporary, workers who strike aren't maintainingrequired &quot;status.&quot;                                                                                                          THE YOUTH SUPPLY shrinks for summer jobs, but more seekersoften apply.   The 16-to-24-year-old force will reach 24 million in July,down 930,000 from last summer, the Bureau of Labor Statisticssays, as that population narrows. Some hotel and resortowners say it's harder to find youngsters who want to work.But more-vigorous promotion of pay as high as $7 an hour andperks such as free bus service to work spurred 7,000applications, up from 4,000 last year, for Six Flags GreatAdventure, in Jackson, N.J.   Bids doubled for work at the Garden State Arts Center inHolmdel, N.J. A job fair produced the surge, helped by aslowing economy, officials say. Long Island's Town ofHempstead boosted starting pay for parks and beach workers to$4.50 an hour from $4, to compete with fast-food firms, andapplications rose more than 10%.   Walt Disney World uses a three-day Food Feast to lurereluctant youths for food and drink service jobs.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: The Dole Foundation will honor McDonald'sfor an &quot;exemplary&quot; record of employing persons withdisabilities; the President's Committee on Employment ofPeople with Disabilities similarly honors Du Pont. . . . Nohard feelings: Sara Lee, cited by the Labor Department lastyear for workplace-safety violations, honors Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole for outstanding achievements in government.</TEXT></DOC>
