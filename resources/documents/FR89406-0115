Pursuantto section 6(a)(1) of that Order, OPM issued government-wide guidance toagencies regarding the implementation of the terms of the Order. On November28, 1986, OPM issued Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 792-16, Establishinga Drug-Free Federal Workplace, to Executive branch agencies covered underthe jurisdiction of Executive Order 12564. On March 9, 1987, OPM issuedFPM Letter 792-17, amending three provisions of FPM Letter 792-16. On December30, 1988, OPM issued FPM Letter 792-18, notifying agencies of actions theyshould take to bring their Drug-Free Workplace plans into compliance withsection 628 of the Treasury, Postal, and General Government AppropriationsAct of 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-440.These FPM Letters are advisory guidance for supervisors and personnel specialiststo use as management tools and ordinarily would not be published underformal rulemaking procedures. The publication of the draft FPM Letter 792-19herein does not mean that OPM is embarking upon a formal rulemaking. Itis simply affording interested parties the opportunity to comment on thedraft FPM Letter before its issuance. In preparing draft FPM Letter 792-19, OPM has consolidated all of the existingFPM Letters on the subject of a Drug-Free Federal Workplace in one issuance.This compilation was deemed necessary as a service to Federal agency officialsand other interested parties and as an opportunity to update the originalFPM Letter issued on November 28, 1986.FPM Letter 792-19 will supersede and replace FPM Letters 792-16, 792-17,and 792-18 upon final issuance. After consideration of comments received,OPM will publish the FPM Letter in accordance with normal FPM issuanceprocedures. In addition, OPM will publish the final version of the FPMLetter in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Publication of this draft FPM Letter also complieswith a court order entered in NTEU v. Reagan, Civ. No. 86-4058 (E.D.

It incorporates the text of the preceding FPM Lettersand any amendments made necessary by subsequent legislation. FPM Letter 792-16 followed both the language of Executive Order 12564 andpre-existing law. The first section of the Letter discusses its purposeand states that the use of illegal drugs by Federal employees, whetheron or off duty, cannot be tolerated and that the Federal government, asthe nation's largest employer, must be in the forefront of the nationaleffort to eliminate illegal drugs from the American workplace.The Letter goes on to set forth agency responsibilities in drafting andimplementing drug-free Federal workplace plans. Each agency head must,pursuant to the Executive order, develop a plan for achieving the objectiveof a drug-free workplace, which contains a policy statement, an EmployeeAssistance Program, supervisory training, provision for employee self-referral,and provisions for identifying illegal drug users (including drug testing).The head of each agency shall, pursuant to the Executive order, test employeesin sensitive positions for the use of illegal drugs. The FPM Letter setsforth recommendations regarding how agencies may carry out their drug testingprograms and drug testing procedures in general. In addition, the Letteraddresses the Executive order mandate that agencies are to maintain statisticalrecords on the number of employees and applicants tested and the numberof confirmed positive test results, while removing personally identifyinginformation from such records. The Letter also describes the role of theEmployee Assistance Program in a drug-free workplace program.Attached to the draft FPM Letter is a sample employee acknowledgement ofnotice of an agency's drug-free workplace program and a model EmployeeAssistance Program.FPM Letter 792-17 was issued on March 9, 1987, as a brief supplement toFPM Letter 792-16. The language contained in FPM Letter 792-17 that amendedFPM Letter 792-16 has been incorporated into the basic test of the portionof draft FPM Letter 792-19 that was taken from FPM Letter 792-16.FPM Letter 792-18 was issued on December 30, 1988, as a notice to Federalagencies of the need to take action to bring their Drug-Free Workplaceplans into compliance with a soon-to-be-effective provision of the Treasury,Postal, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1989, Public Law No.100-440. The guidance contained therein has been incorporated into thedraft FPM Letter for use by agencies that may be established in the future.Draft FPM Letter 792-19 also corrects typographical errors contained inFPM Letter 792-16, 792-17, and 792-18.Finally, provisions that have been rendered obsolete or ineffective byeither the passage of time or subsequent legislative enactments have alsobeen amended or deleted, as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">[Proposal] FPM Letter 792-19</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">SUBJECT: Establishing a Drug-Free Federal Workplace</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Washington, DC 20415</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Heads of Departments and Independent Establishments:<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Purpose</ITAG>a. The use of illegal drugs by a significant proportion of the nationalworkforce has major adverse effects on the welfare of all Americans, andresults in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year. There isno reason to believe that there is a greater incidence of illegal druguse in the Federal workforce than in the private workforce. However, asthe Nation's largest employer, the Federal government and its two millioncivilian employees must be in the forefront of our national effort to eliminateillegal drugs from the American workplace.b. The use of illegal drugs by Federal employees, whether on or off thejob, cannot be tolerated. Employees who use illegal drugs have three tofour times more accidents while at work. Federal workers have a right toa safe and secure workplace, and all American citizens, who daily dependon the work of the Federal government for their health, safety, and security,have a right to a reliable and productive civil service. Federal agenciesmust take action for the protection of individual drug users, their co-workers,and the society at large. In recognition of this, President Reagan, inExecutive Order 12564, set forth the policy of the United States Governmentto eliminate drug use from the Federal workplace.c. Agencies will establish a comprehensive drug prevention program whichis humane, responsible, and effective. In recognition that employees whouse drugs are, themselves, primarily responsible for changing their behavior,the program will include drug education and training, employee counselingand assistance, and voluntary drug testing. However, where appropriate,there will be mandatory drug testing and disciplinary action.d. This will be a balanced program which emphasizes offering a helpinghand to employees who are using illegal drugs. At the same time, it mustbe clear to all that continued illegal drug use by employees will not betolerated.e. Under the Executive order, OPM is directed to issue government-wideguidance to agencies on the implementation of the terms of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Agency Responsibilities</ITAG>a. The head of each Executive agency shall develop a plan for achievingthe objective of a drug-free workplace with due consideration of the rightsof the government, and the employee. Agencies should make every reasonableeffort to ensure workforce understanding of, and employee organizationcooperation with, their drug prevention programs. Communications shouldemphasize the importance of the drug prevention program for agency missionand the community at large. Further, agencies should ensure that theirdrug prevention programs complement agency programs to deal with alcoholabuse and related employee problems.b. Each agency plan shall include:(1) A statement of policy setting forth the agency's expectations regardingdrug use and the action to be anticipated in response to identified druguse;(2) Employee Assistance Program (EAP's) with high level direction, emphasizingeducation, counseling, referral to rehabilitation, and coordination withavailable community resources;(3) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegaldrug use by agency employees (agencies may wish to include material onalcohol abuse in this training);(4) Provision for self-referral as well as supervisory referrals to counselingor treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistentwith safety and security; and(5) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing ona controlled and carefully monitored basis in accordance with E.O. 12564and the guidance contained below.c. Agencies shall ensure that drug testing programs in existence as ofSeptember 15, 1986 are brought into conformance with E.O. 12564.d. Agencies should consult with the Attorney General regarding their drugtesting programs, as provided by section 6(b) of the Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Agency Drug Testing Programs</ITAG><T3>a. Comprehensive Testing for Employees in Sensitive Positions.</T3>In accordance with section 3(a) of Executive Order 12564, the head of eachExecutive agency shall establish a program to test for the use of illegaldrugs by employees in sensitive positions.(1) For purposes of this program, the term ``employee(s) in a sensitiveposition'' refers to:i. An employee in a position that an agency head designates Special Sensitive,Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-sensitive under Chapter 731 of the FederalPersonnel Manual or an employee in a position that an agency head designatesas sensitive in accordance with Executive Order No. 10450, as amended;ii. An employee who has been granted access to classified information ormay be granted access to classified information pursuant to a determinationof trustworthiness by an agency head under section 4 of Executive OrderNo. 12356;iii. Individuals serving under Presidential appointments;iv. Law enforcement officers as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8321(20); andv. Other positions that the agency head determines involves law enforcement,national security, the protection of life and property, public health orsafety, or other functions requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.(2) The head of each agency has discretion to determine which sensitivepositions for which comprehensive testing is authorized ought to be subjectto such testing. This determination should be based on the nature of theagency's mission, its employees' duties, the efficient use of agency resources,and the danger that could result from the failure of an employee to dischargehis or her duties adequately. Thus, who will actually be tested is a functionof a two step analysis by the agency head.i. First, the criteria set forth in section 7(d) of Executive Order 12564must be applied to all employees in the agency to determine which employeesfall into the ``pool'' of employees potentially subject to drug testingthis is the pool of ``employees in sensitive positions'' as defined inthe Executive order. While the definition of the pool of ``employees insensitive positions'' is the same from agency to agency, the testing ofall employees in that pool may be appropriate for some agencies and notfor others depending upon the duties of the positions and the missionsof the agencies. If an agency head decides not to test all employees inthe pool, then a further determination must be made as outlined below.ii. Second, a determination must then be made from this pool as to whichpositions will actually be tested. For the sake of clarity within thisguidance, this second group of positions is referred to as Testing DesignatedPositions (TDPs). Thus, an agency head may determine not to designate allsensitive positions as TDPs, but may limit testing to certain positions.For instance, this may include positions where national security considerationsare present, as well as positions where there is a clear impact on publichealth or safety (e.g., air traffic controllers; operators of motor vehicles;medical, nursing, and related health care personnel) or positions relatingto illegal drug control (e.g., law enforcement officers such as customsagents and drug enforcement agents). Other positions should be reviewedwith particular care when one or more of the following are present as regular,recurring duties: operation or maintenance of any transportation, motorvehicle, aircraft, or heavy or other large mechanical or electrical equipment;work with explosive, toxic, radioactive, or other dangerous materials;work with fluids or gases under heat or pressure; work by employees uniquelypositioned to exploit highly sensitive computer or financial data for financialgain.(3) When selecting TDPs, agencies should ensure that the selection processdoes not result in arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory selections.Agencies must be able to justify their selection of TDPs as a neutral applicationof the selection criteria set forth in section 3(a)(2)(ii), above. Agenciesare absolutely prohibited from selecting positions for drug testing onthe basis of a desire to test particular individual employees.(4) Individuals in TDPs may be selected for comprehensive testing in avariety of ways. For example, their names or social security numbers maybe selected randomly by computer, they may be selected according to theirbirth dates, or they may be selected by the first letter in their surnames.(5) Comprehensive testing may include unscheduled testing and random samplingof the employees within the group of TDPs. As an alternative to this methodof selection, the head of an agency may, at his or her discretion, designatethat all employees in TDPs shall be tested.<T3>b. Voluntary Testing. </T3>The head of each Executive agency shallestablish a program for voluntary employee drug testing that allows employeesto participate in the drug testing program. An agency should afford anopportunity for any employee to step forward and be tested at a time determinedby the agency.<T3>c. Reasonable Suspicion Testing. </T3>In addition to the testing outlinedin subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the head of each Executiveagency is authorized to test an employee when there is a reasonable suspicionthat any employee uses illegal drugs. For the purposes of this program``reasonable suspicion'' is an articulable belief that an employee usesillegal drugs drawn from specific and particularized facts and reasonableinferences from those facts.(1) Prompt supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressingillegal drug use by agency employees should be provided to supervisorsas each agency develops and implements its agency program. Such trainingwill make supervisors more sensitive to employee behavior and help supervisorsrecognize those facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion.(2) ``Reasonable suspicion'' that an employee uses illegal drugs may bebased upon, among other things: i. Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug use and/orthe physical symptoms of being under the influences of a drug;ii. A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;iii. Arrest or conviction for a drug related offense; or the identificationof an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drugpossession, use, or trafficking;iv. Information provided either by reliable and credible sources or independentlycorroborated; orv. Newly discovered evidence that the employee has tampered with a previousdrug test.(3) Where testing is conducted based on reasonable suspicion, each agencyshould promptly detail in writing the circumstances which formed the basisof its determination that reasonable suspicion exists to warrant the testing.Such documentation should be retained in the adverse action file compiledby the agency.<T3>d. Specific Condition Testing. </T3>The head of each agency is alsoauthorized to test an employee for illegal drug use in an examination authorizedby the agency regarding an accident or unsafe practice.<T3>e. Follow-up Testing. </T3>The head of each agency may also requireagency-administered follow-up drug test during or after counseling or rehabilitationfor illegal drug use through an Employee Assistance Program. While follow-uptesting may be undertaken as a part of counseling or rehabilitation underthe Employee Assistance Program, only the results of agency-administeredfollow-up testing may be used, if confirmed positive results are obtained,to support an adverse action taken under section 5(d)(2) of the Executiveorder. To insure its integrity, such agency-administered follow-up testingought to be unannounced.<T3>f. Applicant Testing. </T3>The head of each Executive agency is authorized,but not required, to test any applicant for illegal drug use. Agency headswho choose to test applicants for illegal drug use have a variety of options.For example, depending on the mission of the agency, an agency may wishto test all applicants for employment. On the other hand, as agency maydetermine that it will limit applicant testing to applicants for TDPs.Where an applicant must submit to a physical examination as a conditionof employment, an agency may wish to require a drug test as part of thephysical examination procedures.(1) Agencies should include notice of drug testing on vacancy announcementsfor those positions where drug testing is required. A sample notice provisionfor vacancy announcements or other information about the position wouldread as follows: ``All applicants for this position will be required tosubmit to a urinalysis for illegal drug use prior to appointment in theFederal service.''(2) Where applicants are given preemployment physical examinations, drugtesting may be performed as part of the physical examination procedures.Where no physical examinations are required, applicants should be contactedand directed to report to a designated contractor or agency facility fortheir drug test. Aside from the general notice of the drug-testing requirementin vacancy announcements, applicants should receive as little notice aspossible of the actual date and time of their drug test. A urine specimenshould be taken no more than forty-eight hours after the applicant is contactedto set up the drug testing.(3) In remote locations, applicants should be directed to report to thenearest contractor or agency facility. Agencies ought to provide for reimbursementto applicants for reasonable expenses incurred in travel to the drug testingfacility. In extremely remote areas, the contractor may be required totravel periodically to the region to perform drug-testing of applicants.(4) All applicants with confirmed positive test results should be refusedemployment. <T3>g. Hardship Exemption.</T3> Agencies may choose to exempt certain positionsfrom the drug testing program on the basis of hardship due to the remotelocation of the duty station of the positions, the unavailability of on-sitetesting personnel, or the lack of an appropriate site for test administration.Agencies should, however, use reasonable means to overcome such hardships.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Drug Testing Procedures </ITAG><T3>a. 60 Day General Notice to All Employees. </T3>(1) Agencies whichhave not yet implemented a drug testing program shall ensure that at leastsixty days elapse between a general one-time notice to all employees thata drug testing program is being implemented and the beginning of actualdrug testing. Such notice should indicate the purpose of the drug testingprogram, the availability of counseling and rehabilitation assistance throughthe agency's Employee Assistance Program, when testing will commence, thegeneral categories of employees to be tested, and the general parametersof testing. Agencies may decide to include with their notice a descriptionof their drug program or a copy of the internal personnel rules establishingtheir program. (2) Agencies with drug testing programs already in place prior to issuanceof Executive Order 12564 on September 15, 1986, are not required to stoptesting and provide a 60 day notice period. (3) Any agency may take action as described in parts 3c and 3d. of thisletter without reference to the 60 day notice requirement. <T3>b. Special Notice to Covered Employees.</T3> Agencies should ensurea specific notice is given, in writing, to each employee in a TDP no laterthan thirty days before testing commences. We recommend that agencies obtaina written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice. A sample acknowledgementfor agency consideration is provided as attachment 1 to this letter. Thenotice should contain the following information: (1) The reasons for the urinalysis test, consistent with agency policyformulated in accordance with sections 1 and 3a. of this letter. (2) Notice of the opportunity for an employee to identify himself voluntarilyas a user of illegal drugs willing to undertake counseling and, as necessary,rehabilitation, in which case disciplinary action is not required. (3) Assurance that the quality of testing procedures is tightly controlled,that the test used to confirm use of illegal drugs is highly reliable,and that test results will be handled with maximum respect for individualconfidentiality, consistent with safety and security. (4) Notice of the opportunity and procedures for submitting supplementalmedical documentation that may support a legitimate use for a specificdrug. (5) The circumstances under which testing may occur, consistent with thepolicy set forth in section 3 of this letter. (6) The consequences of a confirmed positive result or refusal to be tested,including disciplinary action. (7) The availability of drug abuse counseling and referral services, includingthe name and telephone number of the local Employee Assistance Programcounselor. <T3>c. Notice to Employees Tested Under Specific Conditions.</T3> Employeesbeing tested under conditions outlined in section 3c, 3d, and 3e will receivenotice that includes information contained in section 4b., paragraphs (1),(3), (4), (6), and (7). <T3>d. Agency Response to Persons Refusing to Participate in a RequiredDrug Test.</T3> (1) To maintain the integrity of the testing and enforcementprogram, agencies should take disciplinary action to deal with employeeswho refuse to be tested. Such action may include, but is not necessarilylimited to, removal of such employees as failing to meet a condition ofemployment. (2) Applicants who are not current employees and who refuse to be testedmust be refused that employment. <T3>e. Technical Guidelines for Drug Testing.</T3> The Secretary of Healthand Human Services, as directed by Executive Order No. 12564, issued MandatoryScientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Employee Drug Testing Programs.53 FR 11970, April 11, 1988. Agencies should conduct their drug testingprograms in accordance with those scientific and technical guidelines.<T3>f. Confidentiality of EAP Treatment Records and Drug Test Results.</T3>Agency drug testing programs under E.O. 12564 shall contain proceduresto protect the confidentiality of (1) medical and rehabilitation recordsand (2) drug test results. These two classes of information are containedin different systems of records and are subject to different confidentialityrequirements. However, both EAP treatment records and drug test resultsmay be utilized in the program. Thus, both are discussed below. (1) Records of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of anypatient which are maintained in connection with performance of a drug abuseprevention program conducted by a Federal agency must be kept confidentialand may be disclosed only under limited circumstances and for specificpurposes. Agencies may wish to refer to regulations issued by the Departmentof Health and Human Services (42 CFR 2.1, <T3>et seq.</T3> (1986)) on maintaining the confidentiality of treatmentrecords. (2) Drug abuse treatment records may be disclosed without the consent ofthe patient only: i. To medical personnel to the extent necessary to meet a genuine medicalemergency; ii. To qualified personnel for conducting scientific research, managementaudits, financial audits, or program evaluation, with all identifying informationremoved from the data; or iii. If authorized by an appropriate court order granted after applicationshowing good cause. (3) Any other disclosure may be made only with the written consent of thepatient, and only under the circumstances set out below. Such consensualdisclosure may be made to the patient's employer for verification of treatmentor a general evaluation of treatment progress. (4) Agency drug testing programs should include confidentiality protectionsconsistent with the above requirements. These protections should extendto drug testing results made a part of treatment and rehabilitation records.(5) Accordingly, drug abuse treatment or rehabilitation records may notbe otherwise disclosed by agencies without the consent of the employeeinvolved. A sample consent for release of patient information during andafter treatment or rehabilitation and a sample release memorandum are includedin attachments 2 and 3, respectively. Any disclosure without such consentis strictly prohibited. (6) As noted above, agencies will also obtain confirmed positive drug testresults that are not part of treatment and rehabilitation records. As partof the drug testing procedure and in conformity with section 503 of theSupplemental Appropriations Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-71, confirmed positivetest results may only be released without employee consent to the agency'smedical review official (as defined in the HHS guidelines), the administratorof the agency Employee Assistance Program (EAP), to the management official(s)empowered to recommend or take action and pursuant to the order of a courtof component jurisdiction where required by the United States Governmentto defend against any challenge against any adverse personnel action. (7) Under the HHS Mandatory Scientific and Technical Guidelines for FederalEmployee Drug Testing, after examination and verification by the medicalreview official, confirmed positive test results will be forwarded to theEAP program administrator and to the management official(s) empowered torecommend or take action. Drug test results should be protected under theprovisions of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, <T3>et seq.</T3>, and should not be released in violation of that Act.<T3>g. Privacy in Drug Testing. </T3>Agency drug testing procedures underE.O. 12564 must allow individual privacy unless the agency has reason tobelieve that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimento be provided. (1) The sample shall be provided in a rest room stall or similar enclosureso that the employee is not being viewed while providing the sample. However,this requirement does not restrict the ability of the employer to controlthe test area and to take other actions to ensure that the employee doesnot substitute or tamper with the sample. For example, the employer may:(a) Control the test area to ensure that samples have not been hidden forsubstitution: (b) prohibit the carrying of bags, luggage, briefcases, orother containers into the test area; (c) prohibit the wearing of coatsand/or jackets in the test area; (d) station a testing official in therest room outside the stall where visual observation is not possible, butwhere the official can monitor the setting for tampering; (e) examine thesample after it is provided for abnormalities in color, temperature, orother evidence that tampering may have occurred. Agencies should referto the HHS Mandatory Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal EmployeeDrug Testing for more specific information on sample collection. (2) Generally, an employee or applicant may be required to provide a sampleunder observation only if there is reason to believe that the employeeor applicant may alter or substitute the urine specimen. For example, employersmay wish to require observation when facts and circumstances suggest thatthe person to be tested: (a) Is an illegal drug user; (b) is under theinfluence of drugs at the time of the test; (c) has previously been confirmedby the agency to be an illegal drug user; (d) is seen to have equipmentor implements used to tamper with urine samples; (e) has recently beendetermined to have tampered with a sample. <ITAG tagnum="84">5. Agency Action Upon Finding that an Employee Uses Illegal Drugs</ITAG><T3>a. Drug Use Determination. </T3>The determination that an employeehas used illegal drugs may be made on the basis of direct observation,a criminal conviction, confirmed positive results of the agency's drugtesting program, the employee's own admission, or other appropriate administrativedeterminations. <T3>b. Mandatory Removal from Sensitive Positions. </T3> While removalof an employee confirmed to have used illegal drugs is authorized underthe Executive order, initiation of an action to remove the employee fromthe Federal service is required after a second determination that the employeeuses illegal drugs. Sections 5(b) and 5(d), respectively, of ExecutiveOrder 12564. If occupying a sensitive position, the employee must not beallowed to remain on duty status in that position. Section 5(c) of ExecutiveOrder 12564. Removal of a sensitive employee determined to use illegaldrugs may be necessary if there are no non-sensitive positions of whichthe employee may be transferred in the agency, unless the agency head determinesthat maintaining the employee in the sensitive position would not posea danger to public health or safety or the national security. <T3>c. Mandatory EAP Referral. </T3> Upon reaching a finding that an employeeuses illegal drugs, agencies will refer the employee to an Employee AssistanceProgram and give the employee an opportunity to undertake rehabilitation.Section 5(a) of Executive Order 12564. While agencies should provide reasonableassistance to employees who demonstrate a desire to become drug-free, theultimate responsibility to be drug-free rests with the individual employee.<T3>d. Discretionary Disciplinary Actions.</T3> Upon the first confirmeddetermination that an employee uses illegal drugs, there is a range ofdisciplinary actions available to an agency, from a written reprimand toremoval. Except for employees who voluntarily identify themselves as usersof illegal drugs, obtain appropriate counseling and rehabilitation, andthereafter refrain from illegal drug use, agencies are required to initiatesome disciplinary action against employees who are found to be illegaldrugs. Section 5(b) of Executive Order 12564. Agencies have discretionin deciding what disciplinary measures to initiate, consistent with therequirements of the Civil Service Reform Act and other appropriate factors.Among the disciplinary measures available to agencies are the following:(1) Reprimanding the employee in writing. (2) Placing the employee in an enforced leave status, consistent with theprocedural requirements of 5 CFR 752.203 or 752.404 as appropriate. (3) Suspending the employee for fourteen days or less consistent with theprocedural requirements of 5 CFR 752.203.(4) Suspending the employee for 15 days or more consistent with the proceduralrequirements of 5 CFR 752.404.(5) Suspending the employee, consistent with the procedural requirementsin 5 CFR 752.404, until such time as he or she successfully completes counselingor rehabilitation or until the agency determines that action other thansuspension is more appropriate to the individual situation.(6) Removing the employee from Federal service, consistent with the proceduralrequirements of 5 CFR 752.404, for: confirmed illicit use of an illegaldrug; refusal to take a drug test authorized by E.O. 12564; refusal toobtain or successfully complete counseling or rehabilition as requiredby the Executive order; or once having completed counseling or rehabilitation,failing to refrain from illegal drug use. (7) Initiating action to separate the employee from Federal service ismandatory upon a second confirmed finding of illegal drug use. Section5(c) of Executive Order 12564. <T3>e. Preponderance of Evidence Requirement.</T3> Agencies are remindedthat any action, including removal, taken against an employee under Title5 United States Code, Chapter 75, must be supported by a preponderanceof the evidence. Care should be taken in the conduct of tests and the handlingof testing samples to ensure that requirements of evidentiary proof maybe met. <ITAG tagnum="84">6. Statistical Reporting </ITAG>Agencies shall keep statistical records on: (1) The number of employeestested and the number of employees with confirmed positive tests; and (2)the number of applicants tested and the number of applicants with confirmedpositive tests. Personally identifying information in these statisticalrecords is strictly prohibited. The HHS Mandatory Scientific and TechnicalGuidelines for Federal Employee Drug Testing contain additional requirementsfor statistical reporting. <ITAG tagnum="84">7. Employee Counseling and Assistance</ITAG><T3>a. Program Requirement. </T3>Federal agencies are required by PublicLaw 92-255, as amended; Public Law 99-570; and by 5 CFR Part 792 to establishprograms for appropriate prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of Federalcivilian employees with drug abuse problems. Agencies are authorized toestablish Employee Assistance Programs to meet this mandate. <T3>b. EAP Requirement. </T3> Executive Order 12564 identifies EmployeeAssistance Programs as an essential element to an agency's plan to achievea drug-free workforce, and explicitly states that agencies shall referall employees found to be using illegal drugs to their Employee AssistancePrograms for assessment, counseling, and referral for treatment or rehabilitationas appropriate. <T3>c. EAP Role.</T3> Employee Assistance Programs play an important rolein identifying and resolving employee substance abuse by: demonstratingthe agency's commitment to eliminating illegal drug use; providing employeesan opportunity, with appropriate assistance, to discontinue their drugabuse; providing educational materials to managers, supervisors and employeeson drug abuse issues; assisting supervisors in confronting employees whohave performance and/or conduct problems which may be based in substanceabuse; assessing employee-client problems and making referrals to appropriatetreatment and rehabilitation facilities; and following up with individualsduring the rehabilitation period to track their progress and encouragesuccessful completion of the program.  <T3>d. EAP Elements. </T3> In keeping with Executive Order 12564, agenciesshould ensure that:  (1) EAP's are available to all employees, including those located outsideof the Washington metropolitan area and major regional cities. Agenciesare encouraged to explore a variety of means for meeting this requirement,including private contractors and cooperative arrangements with other Federalagencies, State and local governments, and non-profit organizations. (2) At sites where it is not feasible to establish a continuing EAP, agenciesshould arrange for employee access on a ``needs'' basis to comparable localresources or, through travel or private telephone calls, to services ofestablished EAP's in other locations. (3) EAP's, whether in-house or operated through contract, are adequatelystaffed with fully qualified individuals who can: i. Provide counseling and assistance to employees who self-refer for treatmentor whose drug tests have been confirmed positive, and monitor the employees'progress through treatment and rehabilitation; ii. Provide needed education and training to all levels of the organizationon types and effects of drugs, symptoms of drug use and its impact on performanceand conduct, relationship of the employee assistance program with the drugtesting program, and related treatment, rehabilitation, and confidentialityissues;iii. Ensure that the confidentiality of test results and related medicaland rehabilitation records are maintained in accordance with the specificrequirements contained in Public Laws 92-255 and 93-282, with regulationspublished in 42 CFR Part 2, and with guidance contained in section 4 ofthis Letter.(4) Adequate treatment resources have been identified in the communityin order to facilitate referral of drug abuse clients.(5) All employees in the agency are informed about the EAP and its services.(6) The Employee Assistance Program plays an appropriate role in the developmentand implementation of the agency's Drug-Free Workplace program. EAP's shouldnot be involved in the collection of urine samples or the initial reportingof the results of drug tests, but rather be a critical component in theagency's efforts to counsel and rehabilitate drug-abusing employees, aswell as in educating the workforce on drug abuse and its symptoms.<T3>e. Further EAP Assistance</T3>. (1) Attachment 4 provides a list ofconsortia throughout the United States. Agencies wishing to join an existingconsortium should contact the individual listed regarding that possibility.(2) Attachment 5 provides the names and addresses of agencies and organizationswhich can be contacted regarding treatment facilities and education materialsthroughout the U.S.(3) The Model Employee Assistance Program provided as attachment 6 addressesthose functions we consider essential for an EAP to provide in supportof the President's drug-free workplace initiative. It should be of useto agencies in developing new EAP's and in assessing the adequacy of existingprograms. OPM's Employee Health Services Branch (Tel. (FTS/202) 632-5558)is available for technical assistance on these provisions.<ITAG tagnum="85">8. Compliance With Section 628 of the Treasury, Postal, and GeneralGovernment Appropriations Act of 1989</ITAG><T3>a. Background Information</T3>. On September 22, 1988, President Reagansigned into law the Treasury, Postal, and General Government AppropriationsAct of 1989, Public Law No. 100-440. Section 628 sets forth drug-free workplacerequirements for Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities.Section 8131(c) of the Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. No. 100-463),which was signed into law on October 1, 1988, extended the effective dateof section 628 until January 16, 1989.<T3>b. Basic provision</T3>. Section 628 provides that:No department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States receivingappropriated funds under this Act for fiscal year 1989, or under any otherAct appropriating funds for fiscal year 1989, shall obligate or expendsuch funds unless such department, agency, or instrumentality has in place,and will continue to administer in good faith, a written policy designedto ensure that all of its workplaces are free from the illegal use, possession,or distribution of controlled substances, (as defined in the ControlledSubstances Act) by the officers and employees of such department, agency,or instrumentality.<T3>c. Relationship to Executive Order 12564</T3>. Executive Order (E.O.)12564, dated September 15, 1986, required agencies to adopt drug-free workplaceplans prohibiting the ``use'' of controlled substances contained in SchedulesI and II, as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(6) and listed in Part B, Subchapter13 of that Title. In order to comply with section 628, agencies may modifytheir drug-free workplace plans to cover (i) ``possession, or distribution,''in addition to ``use,'' and (ii) controlled substances contained in SchedulesIII through V, in addition to Schedules I and II.<T3>d. Limitation</T3>. The inclusion of all controlled substances amongthe scope of drugs covered under a drug-free workplace plan does not licenseto test for drugs other than Schedules I and II controlled substances nowauthorized (such as marijuana, opiates, cocaine, phenyclidine, and amphetamines).<T3>e. Agency Responsibilities</T3>. (1) Agencies which were covered bysection 628 are required to comply with its provisions by January 16, 1989.All agencies which are covered by E.O. 12564 are included within the scopeof section 628; however, the scope of section 628 is broader than E.O.12564. If agency personnel are not sure whether or not an agency it coveredby section 628, they should consult with their agency General Counsel.(2) If an agency or instrumentality is in the Executive Branch, and isnot covered by E.O. 12564, but it is now required to produce and administera written policy to satisfy the provisions of section 628, the agency orinstrumentality may wish to develop its policy in conformity with E.O.12564, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Scientific andTechnical Guidelines, and this FPM Letter. Although an agency is not requiredby section 628 to follow the above mentioned guidelines and the Executiveorder, it is recommended that agencies do so in order to help their writtenpolicies be legally sustained.(3) Agencies which wish to implement section 628 by amending their existingdrug-free workplace plans may do so by adopting the appendix to this FPMLetter as an appendix to their plan. Agencies are not required to submitthis amendment to HHS for certification or approval.(4) Agencies which have already submitted their drug-free workplace plansto HHS for certification are not required to re-submit plans to HHS whichhave been amended to incorporate the provisions of section 628.<T3>f. Agency Compliance</T3>. Agencies or instrumentalities failing tocomply with section 628 by January 16, 1989, may be in violation of theAnti-deficiency Act. Agencies or instrumentalities which anticipate problemswith compliance should immediately consult with their General Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix</ITAG>1.

This is in keeping with the President'spolicy, set forth in Executive Order 12564, to eliminate drug use fromthe Federal workplace and to offer an opportunity for rehabilitation tousers of illegal drugs. This model is intended to supplement ongoing employeeassistance programs which, in addition to drug abuse, address alcohol abuseand other employee problems.2. <T3>Background</T3>. Public Law 92-255, as amended, requires Federal agenciesto develop and maintain appropriate prevention, treatment and rehabilitationprograms and services for drug abuse among Federal employees. Regulationsimplementing this requirement are contained in Title 5, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Part 792. Guidance is further provided in Subchapters5 and 6 of Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 792, and FPM Supplement792-2. Executive Order 12564 of September 15, 1986, established furtherrequirements for agencies and employees in order to obtain a drug-freeFederal workplace. On October 27, 1986, the President signed into law theOmnibus Drug Enforcement, Education, and Control Act of 1986, P.L. 99-570.That law reiterates Congressional concern about the prevention of illegaldrug use and the treatment of Federal employees who use drugs.3. <T3>Objective.</T3> The objective of the EAP is to assist employees withdrug problems to find treatment, to follow up with them during recoveryand rehabilitation, and to help them remain drug free.4. <T3>Policy.</T3> A. As an employer, the (agency) is concerned with thewell-being of its employees, the maintenance of workforce productivity,and the preservation of a safe and secure workplace. The use of illegaldrugs by (agency) employees, whether on or off the job, is inconsistentwith these goals and will not be tolerated.B. The (agency) stands ready to assist employees in becoming drug free.C. Employees who are users of illegal drugs are encouraged to seek counselingand other appropriate assistance voluntarily, including that availablethrough the (agency's) Employee Assistance Program.D. The confidential nature of client records will be safeguarded and onlydisclosed in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of Title 42CFR, Part 2.E. To the extent feasible, program services will be provided to familymembers dealing with the drug problem of an employee, or to an employeedealing with the drug problem of a family member.5. <T3>Program Responsibilities.</T3>_A. <T3>Agency Employee Assistance Program Administrator.</T3> The EmployeeAssistance Program Administrator has the lead role in ensuring that the(agency's) EAP program meets the requirements of E.O. 12564, and is responsiblefor the development, implementation and review of the agency EAP. In additionto supervising the headquarters EAP Coordinator and counselor(s), the Administratorwill provide advice and assistance in establishing field office EAP's.The EAP Administrator will advise agency components on the submission ofannual statistical reports and will prepare consolidated reports on theagency's EAP activity for submission to the Office of Personnel Managementon a fiscal year basis.B. <T3>Employee Assistance Program Coordinators.</T3> (1) The Employee AssistanceProgram Coordinator has responsibility for implementing and operating theEAP within an agency component, such as the Headquarters office or a fieldinstallation. More than one coordinator may be deemed necessary, dependingon the size of the assigned component. Where the EAP services are contractedout, the coordinator has responsibility for monitoring the contractor performanceand verifying services rendered within (agency). The person(s) selectedfor such assignments will be allotted sufficient official time to:(a) Implement effectively the agency employee assistance policy and programas well as to assist in the development and implementation of the agencydrug testing program as it relates to the counseling and rehabilitationof drug-abusing employees;(b) Determine appropriate supervisory training and other activities neededto educate and inform the workforce about drugs and symptoms of drug abuse;(c) Develop and maintain counseling capability (through personnel, medical,or other counseling resource, including contracting out);(d) Establish liaison with community education, treatment and rehabilitationfacilities; and,(e) Evaluate the program and report to management on results and effectiveness.C. <T3>Employee Assistance Counselors.</T3> (1) In some instances, the EAPCoordinator may have the necessary skills, time and motivation to functionas the Employee Assistance Counselor. The Employee Assistance Counselorserves as the initial point of contact for employees who ask or are referredfor counseling, and will be allotted sufficient official time to implementthe program effectively. At a minimum, persons designated as Employee AssistanceCounselors should be, or provisions should be made for them to be:(a) Familiar with the provisions of Executive Order 12564, ``Drug-FreeFederal Workplace'' and Federal Personnel Manual Letter 792-16, ``Establishinga Drug-Free Federal Workplace''.(b) Trained in:_Counseling employees in the occupational setting,_Identification of drug abuse, and,_Administering the Employee Assistance Program.(c) Able to communicate effectively with employees, supervisors and managersconcerning drug use and its symptoms and consequences.(d) Knowledgeable about community resources for treatment and rehabilitationof drug users, including information on fees and payment schedules.(e) Able to discuss drug treatment and rehabilitation insurance coverageavailable to employees through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.(f) Able to distinguish the occasional user from the addicted user andto suggest the appropriate treatment based on that information (e.g., afterhours attendance at Narcotics Anonymous meetings to significant medicalassistance).(g) Able to provide training and education on drug abuse to employees,supervisors, union representatives, etc.  (2) In offices where counseling staff is not available within the agency,reasonable efforts should be made to provide employees with access to aqualified counselor outside of the agency. This may include authorizingofficial time for the employee to visit or be visited by a counselor personally,or other steps which may be appropriate. (3) For employees referred as a result of drug-testing, counselors shoulddocument the treatment plan prescribed. Signature of this document by boththe counselor and client will ensure mutual understanding of the treatmentplan and the consequences of failure to remain drug free.  (4) In order for the counselor to be viewed as the source of assistanceand understanding for employees, the person(s) performing these functionsshould not be involved in the actual drug testing of employees. D. <T3>Employee's Role. </T3>All employees are encouraged to enhance theirdrug awareness through educational opportunities afforded by the EAP orthe community at large. Employees who are illegal drug users are encouragedto seek counseling assistance voluntarily. Employees found to be usersof illegal drugs are required to accept referral to the EAP and are urgedto cooperate with medical treatment and/or rehabilitation programs thatare indicated.  E. <T3>Medical Personnel. </T3>(1) Employee health units provide emergencydiagnoses and first treatment of injury or illness of employees duringduty hours. Where indicated, the employee should be further referred toa private physician or community health service. If such cases ultimatelyare determined to have stemmed from abuse of drugs, medical personnel shoulddiscuss the facts of the situation with the supervisor and the employeeand refer the employee for counseling. A close working relationship withthe EAP Counselor(s) is essential for program success. The Health Unitstaff is available for consultation with and assistance to personnel assignedEAP responsibilities. (2) Where such facilities do not exist, these services are provided wheneverpossible through existing occupational health facilities and/or communityphysicians or clinics.  6. <T3>Training and Education_</T3>A. <T3>Supervisory training. </T3>Employee counselors will conduct or otherwiseprovide training sessions for agency supervisors on the handling of problemsof substance abuse. Appropriate topics include: (1) Drug awareness and symptoms of drug use.  (2) Recommended methods for dealing with the suspected or identified druguser. (3) Supervisory responsibilities under E.O. 12564.  (4) Confrontation and referral techniques. (5) Explanation of the (agency) employee assistance program and its relationshipwith the (agency) drug testing program.  (6) General principles of rehabilitation including techniques for supervisorsto assist employees in returning to the worksite, given specific (agency)needs and requirements. (7) Personnel management issues (e.g., relationship of this program toperformance appraisal and disciplinary programs; leave usage; and, supervisorynotes and documentation).  B. <T3>Employee education. </T3>The Employee Assistance Coordinator will ensurethat employee seminars on topics dealing with drug use are provided periodically.Managers and supervisors shall encourage employee attendance at these seminarsand provide other appropriate support. On a continuing basis, educationalmaterials and information on drug abuse will be available to individualemployees. 7. <T3>Publicity of EAP to employees. </T3>A. The policy and program willbe made known to all (agency) employees. All new employees will be informedof the services available under this program as they enter on duty.  B. The names and locations of Employee Assistance Counselor(s) should belisted in telephone directories and displayed on employee bulletin boards.C. Periodic employee memoranda and other appropriate publications shouldbe used to keep employees informed of EAP services.  8. <T3>Short-term Counseling and Referral. </T3>A. Referrals to the EmployeeAssistance Program are for the purposes of identifying the problem, referringthe employee to the appropriate treatment resource in the community andfollowing up with the employee during recovery and rehabilitation.  B. <T3>Voluntary referrals, </T3>or self referrals, are to be encouraged throughoutEAP materials.  C. In the case of a <T3>management referral </T3>as a result of a positive drug screen, theemployee assistance staff will interview and/or consult with supervisorsand management officials, as requested, and provide them with guidanceon how to refer the drug abusing employee to the assistance program. Oncethe referral is made, and the employee agrees to the appointment with thecounselor, the counselor will require the employee to sign a consent forrelease of information to the supervisor before assistance will be provided.This consent will cover the release of information pertaining to the employee'scompliance with the agreed upon treatment plan and the employee's progressduring and at the end of treatment. Upon obtaining the signed consent,the counselor will assess the problem(s), review the employee's healthinsurance coverage and refer the individual to an appropriate treatmentresource in the Community. The counselor will monitor the employee's treatmentand keep the supervisor advised as to the progress being made. The counselorwill periodically follow-up with the employee and his or her supervisorafter any treatment which occurs and offer support and assistance as needed.9. <T3>Community Resources. </T3>The EAP will develop a working relationshipwith community assistance resources. Program coordinators and counselorswill determine which community agencies or individuals best meet employeeand management needs. Contact should be established with specialized resourcessuch as the following: A. State drug authorities for help in identifying treatment resources fordrug abusing employees; B. Narcotics Anonymous for information on where and when meetings are held;C. Hospital and clinic treatment facilities in order to establish a workingrelationship between the counselor and the receiving treatment source;and,  D. Drug abuse councils to keep abreast of the latest development regardingdrug abuse.10. <T3>Program Interrelationships.</T3>_A. <T3>Relationship with Drug Testing Program. </T3>As called upon, the EAPstaff will work with the drug testing program staff in the developmentand implementation of the drug testing program. However, EAP staff arenot to be involved in the collection of urine samples or the initial reportingof drug test results. EAP efforts are to focus on counseling and rehabilitatingdrug-abusing employees, as well as on educating the workforce regardingdrug abuse and its symptoms.B. <T3>Relationship of the Supervisor. </T3>Supervisors have explicit expectationsof their employees in terms of job performance and behavior. When supervisorsare advised of confirmed employee drug use, they are required to referthe employee to an Employee Assistance Program and to initiate an appropriatepersonnel action. In those situations involving illegal drugs, except asprovided in Section 5(b) of Executive Order 12564, disciplinary actionis required to be initiated against employees who are found to use illegaldrugs. Supervisors should work with the Employee Assistance Counselor tomonitor the employee's progress during treatment and rehabilitation andtake appropriate personnel action should the employee fail to remain drugfree.C. <T3>Relationship with Labor Organizations. </T3>The support and activeparticipation of labor organizations is a key element in the success ofan employee assistance program. Therefore, where there are units of exclusiverecognition, management should:(1) Communicate to labor organizations a strong commitment to providingassistance to employees.(2) Consult or negotiate, as appropriate, concerning the implementationof the EAP.(3) Include union representatives in appropriate training and orientationprograms to ensure a mutual understanding of program policy, referral procedures,and other program elements.11. <T3>Recordkeeping and Reporting._</T3>A <T3>Counseling Records. </T3>Records on employees who have been referredfor counseling will be maintained in a secure and confidential manner.Information on any drug abuse client will be released only to the managementofficial empowered to recommend or take action, in accordance with theemployee's consent to release, and for the reasons identified in section8C above. Any information obtained by a supervisor from the counselor mustbe maintained, as with all employee records, in a strictly confidentialmanner. In addition, to the extent that counseling records include employeetreatment records, they shall be maintained in accordance with Public Law93-579 (Privacy Act), Public Law 93-282 and Title 42 CFR, Part 2 (Confidentialityof Client Records). Consequently, access to these records will be strictlylimited. All appropriate steps, including necessary physical safeguards,will be taken to ensure against unauthorized disclosure.B. <T3>Reports to OPM. </T3>The EAP Administrator will compile sufficientstatistical and programmatic data to provide the basis for evaluating theextent of drug abuse problems and effectiveness of the assistance program.The EAP Administrator will also submit agency-wide reports to the Officeof Personnel Management that contain data required by OPM to meet the statutoryreporting requirements contained in P.L. 99-570.12. <T3>Program Evaluation. </T3>The EAP Administrator and Coordinators willregularly evaluate their program to determine the effectiveness and efficiencyof services. These evaluations will include: services to employees withdrug abuse problems, referral procedures and effectiveness, supervisorytraining, employee orientation, reporting systems, availability and accessibilityof EAP, records systems, outreach activities, staffing and qualificationsprocedures. Written evidence of program evaluations, identified deficiencesand correction plans will be available for review by the EAP Administrator.Documented modifications in the program's assessment and intervention servicesshould be made based upon the findings of such evaluations.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-8129 Filed 4-3-89; 10:30 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6325-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
