But company officials say its commercial space business is about to lift off anyway.    McDonnell Douglas Corp. won the $669.3 million contract in January to build unmanned rockets for the Air Force. The victory has already attracted a flurry of inquiries to the company from potential commercial customers. But Martin Marietta has a $2.2 billion backlog of government orders for its large Titan rockets, giving it a stable production base on which to build a new commercial business.    Indeed, Martin Marietta has already signed preliminary agreements with eight commercial customers to send 10 satellites into orbit on its Titan rockets, which in most cases can carry two satellites at a time. The list includes three agreements completed after McDonnell Douglas received the Air Force award.    Although the pacts represent only tentative commitments, Caleb B. Hurtt, Martin Marietta's executive vice president, predicts that Martin Marietta will soon start firming up its business. &quot;We expect definitive contracts in the very near future,&quot; he says. &quot;By the end of the year, we hope to have several.&quot;    The company moved a step closer to that goal last week when the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, known as Intelsat, authorized its director general to sign a contract with Martin Marietta to launch two satellites. The authorization is subject to resolution of certain launch-related issues.    With the price tag for each Titan launch expected to exceed $100 million, Mr. Hurtt predicts that by the early 1990s, Martin Marietta's annual revenue from commercial satellite launches &quot;could be about equal to&quot; the $500 million in Titan military business that the company expects to have at that time. For 1986, the aerospace and information systems concern had sales of $4.75 billion.    The U.S. commercial space industry got its start after the space shuttle Challenger exploded last year. As part of a recovery plan drawn up in the wake of the accident, the Air Force decided to order some expendable rockets, known as launch vehicles, to carry medium-weight navigational satellites that had been slated to fly on the shuttle. McDonnell Douglas won the contract to build as many as 20 of its Delta rockets. It also became a major factor in the new commercial space business because the Air Force also required it to develop a commercial version of its rocket that would compete with the European Ariane rocket program, among others.    Industry sources say there is probably enough demand for at least two U.S. rocket manufacturers to enter the field. They estimate that, in the wake of the shuttle disaster, about 30 to 45 satellites are awaiting launch. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also expected to buy some unmanned rockets for its own use.    But some analysts say demand might drop, since several telecommunications companies plan to install more fiber optic cable in the U.S. and around the world, reducing the need for communications satellites.    Industry sources say the Air Force's choice of McDonnell Douglas's Delta rocket, rather than the Atlas that General Dynamics Corp. proposed building, is helping Martin Marietta's marketing efforts.    McDonnell's Delta has a significantly smaller payload capacity than Martin Marietta's Titan, meaning it can carry far less weight into space. The capacity of General Dynamics's Atlas, meanwhile, is closer to that of Martin Marietta's Titan. This difference suggests that Martin Marietta would have faced a tougher competitor in the commercial market had the Air Force picked General Dynamics and given its Atlas a boost, some analysts say.    For now, Martin Marietta's and McDonnell Douglas's vehicles are so different &quot;they really don't compete for the same business,&quot; one industry source says.    Indeed, Telesat Canada, the Ottawa-based operator of Canada's domestic satellite system, says McDonnell Douglas's Delta is too small to carry a heavy satellite the company plans to launch in 1990. Telesat made a tentative reservation for a Titan launch by Martin Marietta, a Telesat spokeswoman says, but it also is considering launch proposals from the Europeans and the Chinese.    General Dynamics says that, despite losing out on the Air Force contract, it is still seeking commercial customers. But Alan Lovelace, a General Dynamics vice president, concedes that without a government contract to build its Atlas rockets, his company faces a difficult marketing challenge: It must line up customers one at a time in order to build &quot;an economic base&quot; that will allow it to go forward with production plans.    &quot;We have a number of companies that have indicated a desire to make reservations with us,&quot; Mr. Lovelace says. But he says that the company hasn't yet signed any agreements.    McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, already has tentative launch agreements for seven commercial satellites owned by six customers. &quot;We've been swamped with requests since we won&quot; the Air Force contract, a spokesman says. &quot;We're very optimistic.&quot;    Martin Marietta officials also are excited about the Titan's propects. The company expects to line up enough satellites for four to six commercial flights a year, starting in 1990, Mr. Hurtt says. Its first commercial launch, expected in late 1989, is tentatively scheduled to carry a Federal Express Corp. satellite.    Other customers that have tentative Titan reservations include the Hughes Communications Inc. unit of General Motors Corp.; Intelsat; the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization, a European consortium known as Eutelsat; and the Ford Aerospace unit of Ford Motor Co.    &quot;We are in an active marketing mode,&quot; Mr. Hurtt says. &quot;We don't have anybody telling us, 'Go away. We hate you guys.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
