<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0970 </DOCNO><TEXT>The signal processing for an optical wide band transmission system usinggallium arsenide (GaAs) digital integrated circuits and optical fibershas been investigated. Multiplexing, coding, synchronization, demultiplexing,and error checking at 780 Mbits/ data rates are described. Data storagein memory for linking to a computer is also considered. The design usesavailable GaAs and silicon components. The reliability of GaAs componentsis discussed as well as the layout and thermal considerations requiredfor a high speed system.</TEXT></DOC>
