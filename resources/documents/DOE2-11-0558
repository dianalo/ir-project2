In the spring of 1984, with the Facility nolonger needed for oil-shale research, the U.S. Department of Energy decidedto begin the $3 million decommissioning of the industrial (research)and housing structures. Decommissioning of the APF began in the summerof 1984 with the initiation of an environmental audit and subsequenthazard cleanup. The audit included sampling and analysis of all transformers,ponds, tanks, drums, and other containers; investigation of known andsuspected spill areas; and an asbestos hazard survey. After the knownand potential environmental hazards were identified, cleanup and disposalfollowed. Once the initial environmental hazard identification and cleanupwere completed, a contract for asbestos removal and demolition and reclamationof the industrial plant and housing area was awarded in the summer of1985. The oil-shale mine, raw and retorted shale piles, and water treatmentplant were not included. Asbestos removal and demolition are now completed,and reclamation is nearing completion.</TEXT></DOC>
