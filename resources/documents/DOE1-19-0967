Employment records were obtainedfrom companies producing and/or processing plastics and these were matchedwith the national medical birth and malformation registers. Within thecohorts of pregnancies during which the mother held employment in a plasticsindustry (1.397 in the Swedish and 288 in the Norwegian study), casesof stillbirths or infant deaths, selected malformations, or low birthweight(less than 2,000 g) were identified. For each case two controls fromthe same source were individually matched with regard to date of birth,age of mother, and parity. Exposure data concerning the 44 Swedish andten Norwegian triplets were obtained from the employers. An increasedodds ratio was found for processing of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastics(95% CI Sweden 1.0-5.1; total material 1.1-4.5). However, processingof cold plastics yielded a higher odds ratio than processing of heatedplastics. No increased odds ratio was found for processing of styreneor polyurethane plastics. Since not all of the plastics industries inthe two countries participated in the studies and the number of caseswas small, the result must be interpreted with caution.</TEXT></DOC>
