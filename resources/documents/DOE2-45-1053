The mixture of above mentioned fatty acidswas supplied to the fluidized bed in the range of hydraulic retentiontime (HRT) from 0.25 to 2 days. After the effluent reached in a steadystate in quality, batch experiments were conducted separately with eachfatty acid as a substrate in order to investigate the decomposition characteristicsof each substrate by attached biomass. In order to estimate the parametervalues of the growth kinetics of the bacteria, batch experiments werealso conducted under the completely mixed condition using detached biomassfrom a support material. The changes of fatty acid concentrations withtime were clearly expressed with the Monod growth model. Maximum specificsubstrate decomposition rates and saturation constants, and active biomassconcentrations were obtained by the curve fitting method. The existenceof inert organic matters in the fixed film reactor was indicated in comparisonbetween measured concentrations of volatile suspended solids (VSS) andprotain, and estimated ones of active biomass.
