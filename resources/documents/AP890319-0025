Afghanistan's state radio, monitored in Islamabad, said Sundaythat 215 guerrillas were killed and 64 others injured in the last 24hours of fighting in the strategic eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.It also said ``huge amounts of arms, including missiles, wereseized.''   Neither the guerrilla or communist government claims could beindependently verified.   A spokesman for the fundamentalist Jamiat-i-Islami guerrillagroup said 43 officers and 165 enlisted men of the Afghan 18thDivision defected to insurgents Tuesday about 72 miles north ofKabul.   They handed over 12 tanks, 38 ammunition trucks, long-rangerockets and other military equipment, Mohammad Shoaib said fromJamiat's headquarters in Peshawar, Pakistan.   He said the guerrillas also captured five government officers and32 soldiers in attacks on communist security posts along thestrategic Salang Road on March 10.   The rebels control much of northern Afghanistan's PanjshirValley. The Salang road, Kabul's main land route to the SovietUnion, runs through the valley. Soviet forces in February ended anine-year intervention in Afghanistan, but Moscow continues to sendsupplies to Kabul's beleagured communist government.   The communists maintain their hold on Afghanistan's cities, butguerrillas control more than 90 percent of the countryside.   In Kabul, Afghan authorities said two Pakistani military men,Bashir Majid and Mohammad Afzal, were captured near Kandahar, 300miles southwest of Kabul. Pakistan, which backs the guerrillas, hasdenied any nationals are fighting in Afghanistan.   The Kabul government radio reports said guerrillas fired severalrockets into Jalalabad on Sunday, killing three civilians andinjuring 19, including eight communist troops.   The radio claimed 214 guerrillas were killed and 64 peopleinjured around the city in the last 24 hours. It gave no armycasualties.   Insurgents two weeks ago chose the city, Afghanistan's thirdlargest, for their first major offensive against the Kabulgovernment since the Soviet pullout. They captured a key garrison atJalalabad and breached airport defenses, but communist forces havestalled the advance with massive aerial and artillery bombardments.   Hundreds on both sides are believed to have been killed andwounded since rebels began their attack on March 6. Pakistaniofficials say more than 10,000 civilians have fled the fighting toPakistan, which already shelters more than 3 million Afghan refugees.   Jalalabad lies on a key road between Pakistan and Kabul.Observers believe its fall would be a major blow to the communists.   Speaking in a news conference in Islamabad Sunday, guerrillaleader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar said the insurgents favored a ``gradualfall of big cities in order to avoid massacre and genocide of theAfghan people.''   Guerrilla leaders have formed their own provisional Afghangovernment-in-exile, which would come from Pakistan to establish anIslamic republic if the communists fall.</TEXT></DOC>
