Each Applicant is an open-end investment company organized either asa corporation under the laws of the State of Maryland, or as a businesstrust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Either PaineWebberIncorporated or Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc. serves as investmentadviser to each Applicant.2. Each Applicant is governed by a board of directors or trustees (``Board''),each of which consists of six or seven persons, four of whom are not ``interestedpersons'' as defined in the 1940 Act. The non-interested Board membersare identical for all of the Applicants.3. State law does not normally require Applicants to hold annual shareholders'meetings. Regularly scheduled Board meetings are currently held on thesame day for all of the Applicants in January, May, August and Octobereach year. It is the usual practice to consider an issue affecting morethan one of the Applicants at the same meeting.4. Applicants' respective fiscal year commencement dates are staggeredas follows: January 1 (PaineWebber Series Trust); March 1 (PaineWebberMaster Series, Inc. and PaineWebber Municipal Series); April 1 (PaineWebberCashfund, Inc.); July 1 (PaineWebber RMA Money Fund, Inc. and PaineWebberRMA Tax-Free Fund, Inc.); September 1 (PaineWebber American Fund PaineWebberInvestment Series); December 1 (PaineWebber California Tax-Exempt IncomeFund, PaineWebber Fixed Income Portfolios and PaineWebber Tax-Exempt IncomeFund).5. The selection of independent public accountants is based on the recommendationof the Audit Committee of each Board. Each Audit Committee is composedof those Board members who are not ``interested persons'' as defined inthe 1940 Act. Each Applicant currently employs one of two independent publicaccountants.6. The application of section 32(a)(1), in light of Applicants' presentfiscal years and meeting dates, would require three additional Board meetingsfor the sole purpose of selecting independent public accountants, becausenone of the regularly scheduled meetings falls within 30 days of the followingfiscal year commencement dates: March 1, April 1, July 1 and December 1.If new funds with different fiscal years are established or meeting dateschange, the requirement of section 32(a)(1) could become more onerous.7. Each Applicant submits that it is desirable to consider the selectionof its independent public accountant at the same time as the other Applicantsduring a regularly scheduled Board meeting. Expanding the 30 day windowto 90 days would permit the Applicants to select accountants at one oftwo regularly scheduled Board meetings during the year. Applicants submitthat it is preferable to avoid the extra expense, inconvenience and duplicationof effort that would result from holding additional Board meetings solelyfor the purpose of selecting independent public accountants, as would berequired if the 30 day window were not expanded.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
