Since most people who come to our shores start out poor, the official mind saw public-housing projects as natural havens for illegal aliens. Our experience at the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) may therefore be instructive. In 1986, housing authorities were ordered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to enforce regulations calling for eviction of illegal aliens from public housing on the grounds that they are not eligible for subsidies.    In testimony before the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs on Aug. 6, 1986, I called the regulations unfair, inhumane and an administrative nightmare. I said that allowing for &quot;grandfathering&quot; of all tenants would be the most sensible course and keep us out of the cruel business of breaking up families. Further, the regulations would convert housing-project staffs into arms of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and, as your article points out, also make them interpreters of American foreign policy.    This was part of a general wave of protest that caused Congress to reconsider and prevail on HUD to defer action on this administrative monstrosity until at least Oct. 1 of this year. The new Housing Bill (HR-4) does contain a provision for grandfathering. We urge adoption of this measure as a means of laying to rest the anxiety, confusion and exploitation so well described in your story.    Emanuel P. Popolizio   Chairman, NYCHA   New York</TEXT></DOC>
