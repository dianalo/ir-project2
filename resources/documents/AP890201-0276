David A. Gill, Financial Corp.'s bankruptcy trustee, saidreorganization of the company as a going concern was not feasible,repeating statements previously made by Financial Corp. officialsand others.   Company officials earlier warned stockholders that they wouldlose their entire investments.   Under Chapter 7, a company's assets are liquidated anddistributed to satisfy creditors in order of priority. Creditorsoften receive some compensation under a liquidation, whilestockholders often lose out.   The Chapter 11 filing involved an attempted reorganization whilethe company continued operating. Under a reorganization, investors'claims often are reduced or replaced with different claims.   Financial Corp., former holding company for American Savings andamp;Loan Association, filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of theU.S. Bankruptcy Code on Sept. 9, when the Federal Savings andamp; LoanInsurance Corp. seized American, then the nation's largest insolventthrift.   Without American, there was little left of Irvine-based FinancialCorp.   American was turned over to the Robert M. Bass Group of FortWorth, Texas, in exchange for an injection of $350 million. Thegovernment promised to provide up to $1.7 billion.   Under Bass ownership, the new American Savings is being operatedas a much smaller, solvent Sandamp;L with assets of about $15 billion.   The government assumed responsibility for the thrift's hugeportfolio of bad loans and real estate, which gradually will besold. American management is overseeing that liquidation through a``bad bank'' or ``liquidating bank'' called New West Federal Savingsandamp; Loan, with assets valued on paper at about $22 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
