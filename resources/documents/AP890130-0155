(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A friend of a Marine who died after hewas left in the Mojave desert at the end of a training exercisetestified Monday he had asked about his friend's absence a daybefore he was reported missing.   ``Everybody was like spazzing'' when they realized Lance Cpl.Jason Rother was not at the camp, Lance Cpl. Kevin Robertson said atthe special court-martial of Rother's platoon sergeant. ``Theydidn't know where he was, and it was total confusion.''   Sgt. Christopher Clyde is charged with dereliction of duty anddisobeying an order.   Rother, 19, of Minneapolis, died when he was left at his postafter a training exercise Aug. 30. He was not reported missing untilnearly two days later and his remains were not found until Dec. 4.   The government rested its case Monday, and defense attorneyWilliam Fisher asked to have some of the charges dismissed.   Judge Kent Smith said he would consider the dismissal request,along with a defense request for a delay in the court-martial togive the defense time to respond to some new evidence presentedMonday.   A hearing is scheduled Tuesday for 1st Lt. Allen Lawson, who alsois charged with dereliction of duty. His general court-martial isexpected to start Feb. 7. A third Marine, Sgt. Thomas Turnell, facesa special court-martial Thursday.   Turnell was Rother's squad leader. Lawson was in charge ofplacing road guides, of which Rother was one, on the evening of Aug.30 at the Marine base at Twentynine Palms, Calif.   During the military exercise ``Rother wasn't making it. He fellbehind. He was suffering bad back pain and becoming a heatcasualty,'' Robertson testified.   He said Clyde told him the night of Aug. 30 he had placed Rotheron an easy work detail, an apparent reference to the road guideassignment, in which Rother was to direct a convoy through thedesert. He was not picked up when the exercise was over.   Robertson said at about 2 p.m. on Aug. 31 he asked Turnell and acorporal where Rother was. Turnell said Rother was on a workingparty and the corporal said he would check on Rother, Robertson said.   Rother was not in his bunk at Camp Wilson when Robertson awoke onSept. 1. Robertson said he reported Rother's absence to Clyde, whosaid he would check.   At about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 1, Clyde told him Rother was missing,Robertson testified.   The corporal said he knew Clyde tried to send Rother to the rearduring the exercise to let Rother rest and that it was Clyde whodetermined Rother was missing. ``He's a leader and a good one,''Robertson said of Clyde.   Lt. Christopher Johnson, who also was involved in the exercise,testified Monday that he asked Clyde about Rother's whereabouts theday after the exercise. But Johnson said he was not worried becauseanother road guide was also not back yet.</TEXT></DOC>
