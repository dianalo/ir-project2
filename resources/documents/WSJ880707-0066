The wind blows out of two opposite sides of the galaxy, apparently driven by repeated supernova star explosions, said astronomer R. Brent Tully.    The evidence, an analysis of light from the galaxy by Mr. Tully and Jonathan Bland of the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, is published in today's issue of the British journal Nature.    A galaxy is a cluster of stars, gas and dust. The study focused on one called M82, visible with a small telescope, which lies some 60 trillion miles away in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major.    Mr. Tully said other scientists had suggested the idea of a wind from M82 because of previous observations. No other galaxy has a well-documented wind, he said in a recent telephone interview.    The wind, mostly hydrogen, appears to be going faster and faster the farther it gets from the galaxy, he said. It apparently began at least three million years ago and maybe tens of millions of years ago, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
