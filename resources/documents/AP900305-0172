There were no immediate reports of damage.   An observatory statement said an initial reading of the quake,which struck at 11:49 a.m. EST Monday, revealed the epicenter to beabout 1,400 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia.   No further details were available on the quake, which matched inintensity the tremor that rattled the San Francisco Bay area lastOct. 17. That quake killed 67, injured about 3,000 and caused anestimated $7 billion in damage.   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by anearthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10times greater. A magnitude 6 can cause severe damage on land whilea tremor of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread and heavydamage.</TEXT></DOC>
