The national or Washingtonparty, symbolized by the Democratic Congress, has reverted touninspired liberalism and obstructionism against presidentialappointees. Yet Democratic Governors are in the forefront ofattempts to rethink what government can, and especiallycannot, accomplish. Both types of Democrats jumped into therace this past week.   The national Democrat is Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, who tohis credit doesn't mute his convictions. He offers what hecalls &quot;a new vision of America&quot; for &quot;hard-working men andwomen.&quot; Someone needs to speak for the &quot;little guy,&quot; but sofar Mr. Harkin's vision looks a lot like the New Deal in Iowablue jeans. He's an avowed class warrior. His announcementspeech denounced &quot;the gluttons of privilege&quot; and &quot;the rich,&quot;even as he blamed President Bush for pitting &quot;race againstrace, class against class.&quot; He also managed to attack&quot;special interests&quot; while being the darling of Big Labor.</LP><TEXT>   The Senator says, &quot;We don't need to spend more or taxmore.&quot; Yet he calls again and again for us to &quot;invest inAmerica.&quot; His only specific proposal is to slash defensespending, though there's not enough money in a decade ofdefense budgets to pay for all the causes Mr. Harkin says thegovernment should &quot;invest&quot; in.   Mr. Harkin is especially critical of &quot;supply-sideeconomics,&quot; which he'd place on the &quot;trash heap of history&quot;along with &quot;communism.&quot; This must mean he plans to stay awayfrom the former communists in Europe now trying to implementa supply-side program. It's an irony of the age that Mr.Harkin's economic message has more adherents now in Iowa Citythan in Moscow, or even Stockholm. Nonetheless, Mr. Harkinmight find even fewer adherents if Republicans were nowdefending Ronald Reagan's 92 months of prosperity instead ofthe 1990 budget deal and recession.   Offering quite a different vision is one of thoseDemocratic Governors, Douglas Wilder of Virginia. Mr. Wilderhas drawn attention mainly as a black candidate who isn'tJesse Jackson; this isn't fair to a man who won hundreds ofthousands of white votes in a Southern state. It also isn'tfair to his message, which takes dead aim at &quot;Washingtoninsiders&quot; and the Beltway's &quot;fiscal follies.&quot; The Governor isastute in understanding how fed up many Americans are withwhat he calls &quot;the Washington party,&quot; Democrats andRepublicans alike.   Mr. Wilder calls for &quot;relieving the regressive tax burdenon the middle class,&quot; rather than raising taxes. He even doesthe unthinkable for a Democrat and says, &quot;We must cut tens ofbillions in federal spending that we cannot afford.&quot; This isrefreshing, even as we await his list of specific programs tocut.   The Governor is less refreshing when he dismisses &quot;thephony and divisive issue of racial quotas,&quot; as if affirmativeaction somehow isn't a fit subject for political debate.Especially unrefreshing was Mr. Wilder's infamous remark thatClarence Thomas was worrisome because, having been taught bynuns, he might show too much allegiance to &quot;the pope.&quot;   Mr. Wilder offers less contrast with Tub-Thumper Tom onforeign issues; both men stray dangerously close to endorsingisolationism. Mr. Wilder has even adopted the theme &quot;AmericaFirst,&quot; a slogan of isolationists from William Borah to PatBuchanan. Meanwhile, Mr. Wilder calls Mr. Bush &quot;a Presidentwho thinks that the real threats to our national security arehalfway around the world, when they're really halfway downour streets.&quot; Mr. Bush will no doubt remind voters that partof a President's job description is &quot;commander in chief.&quot;   Paul Tsongas, the former Senator and first Democrat to getinto the 1992 race, calls House Majority Leader RichardGephardt &quot;a protectionist.&quot; Having spent some years out ofWashington, Mr. Tsongas seems to have learned a few thingsabout the real economy. He also commits the heresy ofendorsing a capital-gains tax cut, at least if it's targetedto specific investments. This smacks of industrial policy,but it's progress compared with the &quot;tax cut for the rich&quot;demagogy of both Messrs. Wilder and Harkin.   Many Washington Democrats have become comfortable as amere congressional party, so these candidates deserve creditfor taking the risk of running. A party that has lost five ofthe last six presidential elections has to start somewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
