Unocal said the reductions, most of which will take effectby Aug. 31, are expected to result in annual pretax savingsof $15 million to $20 million.</LP><TEXT>   Unocal's job reductions follow wider cuts announcedrecently by Shell Oil Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. Unocalsaid it will concentrate its research efforts on petroleumexploration and production techniques. Jobs to be eliminatedare in the company's Science and Technology Division in Brea,Calif.   Unocal's termination of refinery research comes as manycompanies are working on &quot;high-tech&quot; gasolines to comply withtighter clean-air requirements. A Unocal spokesman said thecompany could buy any technology needed to meet emerginggasoline standards.   Unocal some years ago developed and licensed a number ofrefinery processes that became industry standards.   This year, Unocal closed its Parachute Creek, Colo.,shale-oil facility, laying off 480 employees. In addition,three chemicals and metals operations employing 3,000 workerswere put up for sale in April. As of Dec. 31, Unocal hadabout 17,500 employees.   Analysts have speculated that larger layoffs may be in theoffing at Unocal, which has said it soon will report sharplylower second-quarter operating profit, compared with a yearearlier. Among the problems hammering the nation's 11thlargest oil company are depressed natural-gas prices anddwindling margins in West Coast gasoline markets.   Citing similar problems, Arco late last week confirmedthat it is planning to cut its domestic work force of 20,000by 5% to 10%. Shell said this month that it will dismiss 10%to 15% of its 31,000 employees and sell or close its LosAngeles-area refinery.</TEXT></DOC>
