The Foreign Affairs Department official, who identified himselfonly as Huang, said most of the damage hit five counties of thethriving commercial city of Ningbo on the East China Sea coast.   Huang said up to 20 inches of rain fell in the area in a ``shorttime'' Friday evening. The storm continued through Saturday morning.   The official China Daily today quoted an unidentified officialof the provincial Flooding and Drought Combating Department assaying those missing in the sudden squall were ``not likely tosurvive.''   The official said the storm destroyed 16,949 homes, 100reservoirs and 305 bridges. He put the economic losses at $167million.   He said communication, power and water supplies were cut off inthe hard-hit areas of Zhejiang until Sunday.   Huang said helicopters had been used to rescue some peoplestranded by the floods. He said the floodwaters covered 154,400acres of farmland. About half the waters have receded, he said.   The storm was the second to pound Zhejiang, one of China's mostprosperous provinces, this year, following torrential rains in lateJune that killed 45 people.   At least 750 people have been reported killed in floods ravagingcoastal, southern and northern China this year, while wide areas ofcentral China are suffering from severe droughts.   Floods are a perpetual threat to areas along the Yangtze Riverbasin and storm-prone coastal regions.   About 3,000 people died in Sichuan province in Yangtze Riverflooding in 1981, 430 were killed by flooding in coastal Shandongprovince in 1982 and 400 perished in floods in northeastern China'sLiaoning province in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
