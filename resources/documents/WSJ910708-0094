The Paris-based agency, which represents 21 majoroil-consuming nations including the U.S. and Japan, predictedthat world demand will take another sharp drop in the currentquarter. But then, in the fourth quarter, there will be thebeginnings of a rebound as economies recover, particularly inthe U.S., keeping oil demand for all of 1991 flat for thesecond straight year, according to the IEA.</LP><TEXT>   By next year's first quarter, the IEA reported in itsfirst look ahead to the 1992 petroleum picture, demand shouldbe gaining rapidly in line with the near-routine surges thatwere cut short in 1990 by recession and by the runup in oilprices in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis. The IEApredicted first-quarter demand will be 800,000 barrels a dayfrom the level of the 1991 quarter.   In Paris, an IEA official said such an indicated sharpincrease in demand probably will influence oil markets andpetroleum prices before then. &quot;There likely will be a tightermarket in the fourth quarter,&quot; the official said in aninterview.   Also, he said, &quot;it is because of {the possibility of anupturn} that we haven't seen any substantial decline inprices&quot; this year during the seasonally slack period fordemand. Although prices had been expected to fall in thisyear's second quarter, they have held surprisingly firm,ranging between $17 and $21 a barrel for weeks.   Oil demand traditionally jumps during the winter months,when colder weather increases fuel consumption. Also, demandhad been expected to be higher in the 1992 first quarter on ayear-to-year basis because of the past mild winter in theU.S. and Europe.   But the IEA's prediction is more than was generallyexpected. And most, if not all, of the IEA's estimatedincrease will come from higher oil use in the U.S. For NorthAmerica, the IEA forecasts 1992 first-quarter demand of 19million barrels a day, up from 18.2 million a day in thisyear's initial quarter.   &quot;A rather robust recovery in the U.S. economy is builtinto the projections,&quot; the IEA official said. &quot;We are showingpositive U.S. growth in the second half of 1991, after anegative first half, and a further rise in the rate of growthin the first half of 1992,&quot; he said.   The IEA's estimates of oil demand and supplies for theinitial three months of 1992 were included in its latestmonthly oil market report released last week in Paris. TheIEA estimated that first quarter world demand will average68.4 million barrels a day, up from 67.6 million barrels aday in this year's comparable period.   For all of 1991, the IEA estimated world oil demand willaverage 65.8 million barrels a day after the third-quarterdrop and the fourth-quarter comeback. For the year, thatwould be slightly higher than the average of 65.7 millionbarrels a day for 1990 and 1989.   On the supply side, the IEA projected a decline inproduction outside the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries equal to the climb in world demand of 800,000barrels a day for the first quarter. The agency foreseesnon-OPEC output of around 41.2 million barrels a day, downfrom 42 million in 1991's first quarter.   The bulk of the non-OPEC drop will be accounted for by acontinuing severe decline in oil output in the Soviet Union,still the world's largest petroleum producer. According tothe IEA, the Soviet Union is expected to produce only 10.2million barrels a day in next year's first quarter, down from10.9 million a year earlier.   Still, world oil supplies should be ample despiteuncertainties over future exports from Iraq and Kuwait. Butmore oil obviously will have to come from OPEC and from worldinventories. The IEA's figures suggest that OPEC will need toproduce between 24 million and 24.5 million barrels a day inthe 1992 first quarter. That would compare with OPEC's Juneoutput of around 22.6 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
