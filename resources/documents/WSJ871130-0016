Although no significant agreements have been signed, all seven of the Baby Bells have been talking with information vendors such as CompuServe Corp. about distributing their data bases. Industry executives say a number of agreements are almost certain to be signed within the next six months. The alliances, experts say, could be a turning point for the electronic information industry, which has for years been unsuccessfully searching for a mass market.    Industry participants predict that current contacts between numerous companies will yield billing and marketing agreements designed to attract home users and thus to widen the electronic information market beyond business. &quot;We are exploring opportunities with a lot of people,&quot; says K. Ray Mashburn, division manager, information services marketing, for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. &quot;We are going to do some things in the marketplace.&quot;    Southwestern and other Bells are reluctant to say what companies they're talking to, but they describe them generally as data-base services and software companies, among others. But Chicago-based Ameritech says one project involves an alliance with a water utility in southern Wisconsin to measure water use over the phone lines.    Among vendors, Charles W. McCall, president of Columbus, Ohio-based CompuServe, a unit of Handamp;R Block Inc., says five of the seven Baby Bells have come calling in the past six months. New York-based EIC/Intelligence Inc., a clearinghouse for data bases on biotechnology, acid rain and other scientific data, is trying to seek alliances with BellSouth Corp., says James G. Kollegger, EIC president.    The most significant alliances will likely involve &quot;gateways,&quot; electronic listings of data-base vendors. Using a home computer, customers would dial up the gateway over a Bell phone line. Customers would select from the list and retrieve information without having to contact the data base beforehand to become a subscriber. One phone number would provide access to all vendors participating in the gateway, and the phone network over which the data travels could even allow incompatible computers to communicate. The bill for using the electronic data could even be included with the phone bill.    At the Information Industry Association's annual convention in Chicago two weeks ago, BellSouth became the first Bell to demonstrate a gateway. The gateway, which stole the convention's spotlight, involved collaboration with major players such as CompuServe, US Sprint Communications Co.'s Telenet Communications, and Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper.    The BellSouth gateway was only a prototype, and the judge overseeing the Bell system breakup may prevent BellSouth from doing everything it wants to do with its gateway. But the company expects to introduce some type of gateway product to the public next year.    &quot;Dialing up a data base should be as easy as dialing a telephone,&quot; says C. Sidney Boren, a BellSouth vice president. Instead, there are barriers now to drawing more customers, who must subscribe first to each data base, all of which are reached through different phone numbers and dial-up, or &quot;log-on,&quot; procedures.    Industry executives say gateways would greatly expand the potential customer base for electronic data. BellSouth, for example, has 15 million phone customers in nine Southeastern states.    &quot;If we could have 10% or even 5% of those customers, it would double or triple our business,&quot; says CompuServe's Mr. McCall. CompuServe has 390,000 subscribers; in the six months ended Oct. 31, it had pretax earnings of $11.3 million on revenue of $60.8 million.    What gateways will be able to do depends largely on a pending final ruling by federal Judge Harold Greene, who continues to monitor compliance with the terms of the 1984 Bell system breakup. In September, Judge Greene allowed the Bells to use their networks to transmit electronic information supplied by others. But he continued to bar the Bells from using their phone lines to distribute their own information products.    For example, they can't offer an electronic Yellow Pages directory or engage in other electronic publishing, a prohibition that remains a sticking point in relations between the phone companies and newspaper publishers.    The ruling would appear to be a major hurdle for Ameritech, which acquired an option for $5 million to buy as much of 15% of INET, based in Chantilly, Va. The start-up gateway service company, owned principally by Bell Canada Enterprises, uses the public data network of US Sprint Communications Co.'s Telenet Corp. unit to allow access to its own and others' data bases. All seven Baby Bells have filed notices to appeal the Sept. 10 ruling.    In any case, Judge Greene is expected in the next two months to issue a final order clarifying exactly how the Bells can transmit electronic information. The Bells have filed court briefs seeking broad flexibility, but some information vendors have argued against giving the phone companies a free hand. One big fear, which the phone companies say is unfounded, is that the Bells might charge unfair prices for transmission. Longer term, vendors have an even bigger worry.    The phone concerns &quot;could be serious competitors,&quot; says CompuServe's Mr. McCall. As a result of his talks with the Bells, Mr. McCall believes some &quot;would be very interested in acquiring us,&quot; if that were legal now, he says.    Despite concerns about competition, the information industry -- an amalgam of newspaper publishers, computer concerns, data bases and communications networks -- is rapidly concluding it needs the regional Bell concerns to have any chance of prospering. &quot;No one company can do it all alone,&quot; says Dan M. Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of Frost andamp; Sullivan Inc. and the association's immediate past chairman.    Attempts by Knight-Ridder Corp. and Times Mirror Co. to establish videotex services, for example, failed miserably. Moreover, on-line services are unprofitable but for a handful of large concerns such as McGraw-Hill Inc. and Dow Jones, which largely serve business users.    &quot;Everybody is being careful, but there is much more cooperation than you would expect,&quot; says EIC/Intelligence's Mr. Kollegger. Says Dan P. Behuniak, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s assistant vice president of federal regulatory matters: &quot;The information providers, in essence, don't see us as having horns anymore.&quot;    It all boils down to &quot;fear and greed,&quot; says Mr. Sullivan. &quot;Sometimes fear controls greed, and sometimes greed controls fear.&quot; He concludes: &quot;You enter these alliances because there is more money in doing them than in not doing them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
