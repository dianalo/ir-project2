Background </ITAG>Under section 644 of the DOE Organization Act, Public Law 95-91 (42 U.S.C.7254), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to prescribe such proceduralrules and regulations as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to accomplishthe functions vested in that position. Accordingly, the DEAR was promulgatedwith an effective date of April 1, 1984, (49 FR 11992, March 28, 1984),48 CFR Chapter 9. The purpose of this rulemaking is: (1) To revise the DEAR to implement changes to conform with FAR 31.205-6(g)(2)(i)and to be consistent with contractor legal requirements to adhere to theprovisions of certain labor laws. FAR 31.205-6(g)(2)(i) was revised todelete the provision disallowing severance payments which are in additionto early or normal retirement payments. However, severance payments willstill be required to meet the remaining criteria for severance pay as wellas the test of overall reasonableness of compensation. (2) To revise the DEAR to conform with FAR 29.401-6. FAR 29.401-6 was addedto eliminate double taxation of Government cost-reimbursable contractorswhich purchase tangible personal property to be used in performing services,title to which passes to the United States upon delivery of the propertyto the contractor by the vendor. This agreement is effective only whenthe clause, at FAR 52.229.10, State of New Mexico Gross Receipts and CompensatingTax, is included in each cost-reimbursement contract. Failure to includethe clause in each cost-reimbursement contract means that the governmentreimburses the contractor the gross receipts tax paid to a vendor for purchasedtangible personal property, and reimburses the contractor for its own grossreceipts tax, which includes the tax already paid on purchased property(double taxation). (3) To revise DEAR 970.4204-16, Payments and Advances, to include a 90-dayinterval for the contractor to notify the Contracting Officer of claimsbased upon liabilities of the contractor to third parties arising out ofthe performance of the contract. The contractor will be required to givenotice of such claims in writing to the Contracting Officer within 90 daysafter the contractor knew or should have known about such claims from theclaimant, and takes whatever action may be required to protect the contractor'sand the Government's interest during this 90 day period. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements </ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291 This Executive Order, entitled ``Federal Regulations,'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) priorto their promulgation. OMB Bulletin 85-7 exempts all but certain typesof procurement regulations from such review. This proposed rule does notinvolve any of the topics requiring prior review under the bulletin andis, accordingly, exempt from such review. B. Review Under the Regulaory Flexibility Act This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980, Public Law 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impacton interest rates, tax policies or liabilities; the costs of goods or servicesor other direct economic factors. It will not have significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatoryflexibility analysis has been prepared. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Public Law 96-511) does not apply becausethis proposed rule does not impose additional reporting or recordkeepingrequirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors, ormembers of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C.3501, et seq. D. National Environmental Policy Act DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having a significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>, 1976), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508), and the DOE guidelines (10 CFR part 1021),and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or anenvironmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. E. Review Under Executive Order 12612 The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve issueswhich are expected to have a substantial direct effect on traditional statefunctions or their institutional interest and thus the ``federalism'' assessmentrequirements of Executive Order 12612, (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987)do not apply. F. Public Hearing DOE has concluded that this rule does not involve a substantial issue offact or law and that it should not have a substantial impact on the nation'seconomy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore, pursuantto Public Law 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, the DOE does not proposeto hold a public hearing on this rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 970 </ITAG>Government Procurement; Management and Operating Contracts.For the reasons set out in the preamble, chapter 9 of title 48 of the Codeof Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on August 2, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.
