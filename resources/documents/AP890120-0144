How about a word?''   As usual, Reagan responded with a grin and shrug.   It was likely to be the last time ABC correspondent Sam Donaldsonwould shout at Reagan _ in Washington, at least. Donaldson got onthe plane with the former president to cover his arrival inCalifornia later.   When Reagan left the White House Friday morning, Donaldson left,too, after 12 years as ABC's chief White House correspondent. He hadfrequently said in the past that he was going to leave but finallydid it after Reagan.   ``I'm going out with no regrets,'' he said Thursday. ``And it's apleasure they're not carrying me out feet first and not pushing meout, but I'm going of my own will.''   Brit Hume took over the job as of noon Friday with theinauguration of George Bush. Donaldson is expected to be namedco-anchor later this year of a new, prime-time ABC news program andwill continue to appear on ``This Week with David Brinkley.''   Before getting on the plane, Donaldson noted to ABC anchormanPeter Jennings that ABC, too, was undergoing a changing of the guard.   ``I'm history, like Ronald Reagan,'' he said.   ``I hope I haven't upset too many of President Carter orPresident Reagan's partisans,'' Donaldson said, a reference to hisreputation as the most aggressive member of the White House presscorps.   His habit of shouting questions at Reagan during ``photoopportunities'' was often cited by critics as an example of anarrogant and disrespectful news media.   Donaldson said again Thursday he shouted questions only whenthere was no other way to get an answer.   ``To talk to Jimmy Carter, except in the last few months of hispresidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis, he wasavailable,'' Donaldson said. ``For Reagan, the alternatives were gofor months or speak out. And if, as they always did in public keephim 50 yards away, to speak out meant you had to raise your voice.''   He thought his successor might have an easier time of it. ``Itrust from what we know about him, no one's going to have to yell atGeorge Bush,'' Donaldson said.   If Reagan's supporters were irked by Donaldson, the White Housestaff seemed to take him in stride. The final White House newssummary under the Reagan administration included a reprint of acartoon from The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal depicting a smilingReagan in a T-shirt inscribed, ``I survived Donaldson.''</TEXT></DOC>
