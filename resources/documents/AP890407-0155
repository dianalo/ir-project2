SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A destructive earthquake seems almost certainto strike the eastern United States sometime in the next twodecades, a Senate subcommittee was told Friday.   While scientists cannot predict when or where the quake mighthit, or its strength, they consider one almost sure to occur beforethe year 2010, according to Robert L. Ketter, director of theNational Center for Earthquake Engineering Research.   Both Ketter and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., cited the Armenianquake in December as raising attention to similar dangers in theUnited States.   Quakes in the eastern part of the United States have receivedless attention than those in the West because the strongest easterntremors came before the nation was heavily developed and thus ledto few losses of lives.   Ketter told the subcommittee that while the likelihood of aquake in any particular place is low, ``the probability of oneoccurring somewhere in the Eastern United States before the year2000 can be considered better than 75 percent to 95 percent. Beforethe year 2010, nearly 100 percent.''   The potential for quakes in Armenia was also well known, yetlack of preparation left thousands dead and massive damage,Cranston told the Senate subcommittee on science, technology andspace.   ``The hazard in many parts of the U.S. is no less certain thanit was in Armenia,'' said Cranston, citing quakes that have causeddeath and major damage in California, Idaho, Kentucky, Alaska andother states.   ``The challenge that faces us now is to use our new capabilityand capacity for earthquake hazards reduction before we have toface the public and explain our inaction _ as the Soviets nowmust,'' Cranston said.   The senator's comments came in support of a bill to strengthenthe national earthquake hazards program, including a transfer ofthat activity to the U.S. Geological Survey. Currently theearthquake program is part of the Federal Emergency ManagementAgency.   Cranston noted that earthquakes, once thought of as primarily aCalifornia and Alaska problem, are now known to be a major dangerto many states.   Perhaps the most powerful quake ever to strike the United Statesoccurred in a series of tremors in 1811-1812 that rocked the NewMadrid, Mo., region, Ketter testified.   In addition, severe quakes in the 18th century and 19th centurystruck Charleston, S.C.; Boston; under the ocean near New YorkCity, and in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, Ketter told thesubcommittee.   Compounding the problem is the fact that in the eastern statesunderlying rocks are older and more dense. Thus, reported Ketter,``earthquakes in the East can cause damage over a much larger areathan in the West.''   One of the 1811 quakes in Missouri, for example, had a strengthsimilar to the 1906 San Francisco quake. The temblor in Missouri,however, affected an area 15 times larger than the California quake.   Lacy E. Suiter, chairman of the Central U.S. EarthquakeConsotrium, testified that there is a 40 percent to 63 percentchance of a strong quake occurring in the Ned Madrid, Mo., regionby the turn of the century.   Ketter said that if the 1811-1812 Missouri quakes were to occurtoday, the death toll could approach 5,000 people with massivedestruction in such communities as Memphis, Tenn.; Paducah, Ky.;Carbondale, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.; Poplar Bluff, Mo., and LittleRock, Ark.</TEXT></DOC>
