 First-generation WORM disk drives haveprimarily used a continuous-servo format.andP;  But as WORM disk drives getsmaller and faster, design difficulties have caused many companies to rethinktheir position about standards and interchangeability.andM;However, many key players in the disk-drive market have chosen to implementthe sample-servo (SS) system for their second-generation drives because ofits advantages over competitive technologies.andP;  These second-generation WORMdisk drives also pave the way for future erasable, or rewritable, andmultifunction drives that will incorporate both WORM and erasable functions.andO;The designers of these products must first weigh servo options--continuous-vs.andP;  sample-servo systems.andM;In a typical continuous-servo system, the servo information is continuouslygenerated with analog filters providing compensation.andP;  The media's think filmof tellurium alloy is commly used as the sensitive-information storing layer.andO;Recording is done by physically ablating a hole approximately one micron indiameter in the tellurium film with a highly focused laser pulse.andP;  Readbackis accomplished by scanning a laser beam along the preformatted track.andP;  Theabsence of tellurium alloy in the hole area leads to a drop in thereflectivity signal.andM;There are potential limitations associated with first-generation designs.andO;First, interference among servo signals is inevitable; focusing, tracking andclock-synchronization servo signals are continuously detected along with thedata.andP;  As a result, tight specifications in the quality of opticalcomponents, as well as restrictions in the code design, are essential.andM;Second, because the servo information is intimately coupled to the data, thisinformation is affected by the media's modulation code and read/writecharacteristics.andP;  And third, with ablative media, the servo information isn'tpresent in the ablated-hole areas, which can lead to fundamental limitationsin bit density.andM;The track-following placement of servo information is typically generated bythe so-called push-pull method.andP;  A beam is reflected from the media to a beamsplitter, where it's deflected from the beam path, back to the laser and ontoa split photodetector, creating an input to the tracking-servo system.andP;  Ifthe beam is on track, equal amounts of returning light strike each half ofthe photodetector.andM;When the beam moves off the track's center, the returning beam has a greateror lesser amount of light on one side at the split photodetector.andP;  Thiselectrical-signal unbalance can tell the tracking-servo system which way andhow much the beam has shifted from the track's center.andM;Accurate detection of a tracking error from the continuous groove is acomplex optics phenomenon; the tracking error must be distinguished from afocusing error.andP;  For example, a focusing error cn be sometimes coupled into,and appear as, a tracking error, depending on the quality and alignment ofthe various components.andP;  High-qu ality optical components are generallyneeded to compensate for this problem.andM;The continuous-format media has a spiral-grooved track with clock, focus andtracking information taken from the modulation code and monitoredcontinuously.andP;  If a piece of dirt lies under one side of the hub, if a diskis warped, or if the diode laser or objective lens isn't exactlyperpendicular to the disk, the disk drive will experience disk tilt.andM;With disk tilt, a beam hits the disk at an angle, not perpendicularly to thedisk surface.andP;  When the resulting offset of the return beam is in the radialdirection, the split photodetector sees the beam as coming from the groove'sside, thus confusing the tracking signal.andM;Disk tilt can give a false signal to the tracking-servo system.andP;  Then, thetracking-servo system moves the mirror in an attempt to steer the beam, eventhough th e beam may be already on track.andP;  Additionally, with grooved media,a focusing error interferes with the radial-tracking detection to causeoptical crosstalk.andM;Formatting data into the media also varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.andO;In order to achieve media interchangeability, continuous-servo systemmanufacturers would need very complex servo electronics to compensate fordifferent manufacturers' media.andM;Sample-servoandM;The sample-servo system is based on the Nyquist Sampling Theorem whichbasically states: For any waveform, the information contained within a givenbandwidth can be fully described by periodic sampling at twice the bandwidth.andO;In contrast to the continuous-servo system, the sample-servo system's mediais grooveless.andP;  Instead, specific areas on the media are allocated fordefining the tracking, focusing and clock-synchronization information; theseareas are separated from the data.andM;International Standards Organization's 130-mm sample-servo system has 32sectors for each rotation of the disk.andP;  Each sector comprises 43 servosegments; each servo segment contains a 2-byte-long servo flag, plus 16 bytesof data.andP;  The servo flag contains separate areas for the disk drive to placetracking, focusing and synchronization information.andP;  Clock pits are locatedwith the wobble pits, or tracking pits, within the 2-byte preformatted servoflag.andP;  Smaple-servo system data appear approximately 1,400 times perrevolution.andM;Tracking information is derived by sampling the amplitude of the readbacksignal at the wobble pits.andP;  The wobble pits consist of two pits that arepreformatted into the disk, offset from the track's center by about a quarterof a track pitch.andP;  If the laser spot follows along the track's center, theamplitudes measured at the wobble pits will be equal.andP;  If the laser spot isoffset from the track's center, then the amplitude of one wobble pit will behigher.andP;  The difference between the two wobble pits' amplitudes isproportional to the tracking error.andM;Focus can be measured by several methods (e.g., the astigmatic method or theFoucault method).andP;  Clock-synchronization information is obtained by measuringthe time duration between the preformatted clock pits.andM;Why sample-servo is betterandM;Noteworthy differences between the continuous-servo system and thesample-servo system give the sample-servo important advantages in someapplications.andP;  One specific improvement is that, in the sample-servo sy stem,focusing error is measured in the blank area within the servo flag.andP;  Thereare no preformatted pits or grooves in this area, so there isn't anycrosstalk or interference between tracking and focusing signals.andM;Additionally, because the servo information is completely separated fromreading and writing, adapting to different vendors' media with differentwrite characteristics is considerably less of a problem in the sample-servosystem.andP;  Because of this adaptability, media interchangeability has alreadybeen achieved with relatively little effort among leading sample-servo systemmanufacturers, as well as among many media vendors.andM;Interesting future developments (e.g., in digital processing) are possiblewhen using the sample-servo system approach to obtain servo information.andP;  Ina sample-servo system, servo information is measured only at specific times.andO;Depending on the system's sophistication, designers can perform, for example,analog-frequency compensation and digital-error calculations.andP;  Alternatively,all compensation an d calculations can be implemented in a digital-signalprocessor.andP;  With this approach, all the servo electronics can be fullyintegrated, allowing for inexpensive, small form-factor disk drives andgreater overall system tolerance.andM;In addition to facilitating media interchangeability for WORM disk-drivemanufacturers, the sample-servo system presents some interesting options forerasable-optical technology.andP;  Various companies are studying and developingoptical-media possibilities such as magneto-optic and phase-change.andM;Fundamentally, magneto-optic media are similar to thin-film,vertical-recording media; information is stored according to the direction ofmagnetization (up or down).andP;  With magneto-optic media, recording and readingis performed by optical means.andP;  Simultaneous application of laser-pulseheating and magnetic field switches the direction of magnetization, whenrecording on magneto-optic media.andP;  A linearly polarized beam of laser lightis scanned across the magnetic domains, when reading magneto-optic media.andM;The direction of magnetization determines the rotation of the polarizedreflected light.andP;  Then, this rotation can be detected with properly designedoptics.andM;Current magneto-optic media are double-sided, but don't permitdirect-overwrite; previously written data must be erased with a separate passof the laser beam over the track, before further data can be written.andM;However, many development laboratories are actively pursuing variousapproaches toward direct-overwrite, magneto-optic systems.andP;  This system wouldrequire magnetic heads that are positioned close to the magneto-optic media.andO;The future, direct-overwrite magneto-optic disk drives will be, in alllikelihood, single-sided.andP;  And, like their magnetic cousins, could besusceptible to head crashes because of their close proximity to the head.andM;Phase-change media is based on the transformation of crystalline andamorphous phases of certain alloys.andP;  When matter is cooled from its liquidstate, the atoms have a tendency to condense into a solid that has awell-defined structure; the cooling process creates the crystalline form ofthe solid.andP;  However, if the cooling is extremely fast, the atoms condenseinto a solid form that retains some of the liquid's properties, thus creatingthe amorphous phase of the solid.andM;Tellurium-based alloys, in particular, exhibit both stable crystalline andamorphous phases; these phases have different optical characteristics.andP;  Byproperly choosing material composition and media structure, information canbe recorded into and erased from the tellurium alloy's thin film, because theproper laser pulse allows switching between the amorphouse and crystallinestates.andP;  Phase-change media is both double-sided and permitsdirect-overwrite, but it is more difficult to manufacture than magneto-opticmedia.andM;Best of both worldsandM;In addition, several sample-servo system manufacturers are investigatingmultifunctional disk drives.andP;  This type of disk drive, for example, wouldread and write both ablative and erasable phase-change media, making the diskdrive both WORM and rewritable.andM;For users requiring both WORM and rewritable capabilities, a multifunctionaldisk drive provides a cost-effective solution.andP;  It would be easy to build amultifunctional disk drive using the sample-servo system format because ofthis format's media flexibility.andP;  Also, it would be easy to build amultifunctional disk drive that is backward-compatible with existing mediawritten on existing WORM disk drives.andM;David Lou received his bachelor's and doctorate degrees in physics from theUniversity of California, Los Angeles.andP;
