The regulators fear that the case, which centers on thestock-trading activities of a woman and the former presidentof Chiyoda Finance Co., makes the new insider-trading lawlook toothless. Coming on the heels of Michael R. Milken'sadmission of guilt to securities-law violations in WallStreet's biggest criminal insider-trading case, thedifficulty that Japanese regulators have experienced inpursuing their own investigation under the new lawparticularly rankles some officials.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I wish we could have as much power as&quot; the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission, says an official at theFinance Ministry, one of the agencies charged withinvestigating improper share dealings. The SEC has a largestaff of investigators and lawyers who are empowered tosubpoena information and witnesses.   By contrast, the Finance Ministry relies on informal, notlegal, influence and is short on staff: The number ofofficials who conduct such inquiries soon will rise to 17from seven at present. The ministry usually must rely on theTokyo Stock Exchange's surveillance department to help.   But both the ministry and the exchange came upempty-handed when they began inquiries into the current case,the first possible violation of last year's insider-tradinglaw. They lack the power to demand access to evidence orcompel witnesses to testify.   As a result, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department --acting on its own initiative -- took up the insider-tradingcase and now appears close to beginning Japan's firstinsider-trading prosecution. That turn of events isembarrassing for market regulators, who pride themselves ontheir close attention to the market and who last Aprilproudly implemented the legislation designed to make insidertrading illegal in Japan for the first time.   A police spokesman confirmed that an investigation isunder way but would give no details. He declined to say howthe investigation was begun. No charges have been filed, hesaid.   However, Finance Ministry officials said, and Japanesenewspapers have reported, that the inquiry is focused on thestock-market activities of a woman who the officials identifyas the girlfriend of a former president of Chiyoda, a smallJapanese finance company. The president, officials say, hadadvance knowledge that a small Japanese company, NisshinKisen Co., planned to issue new stock in order to fund thepurchase of a hotel in Australia. Nisshin Kisen is also knownas Nisshin Steamship Co., the English translation of theJapanese name.   The finance company's president -- who resigned March 31,citing health reasons -- was told by Nisshin officials ofNisshin's plans on June 8. Before the issue was announced,the financier, apparently through his woman friend's account,bought 7,000 shares in Nisshin, investigators believe. A daybefore the stock issue was announced on June 16, Nisshin'sshare price rose 160 yen ($1.01) to 2,210 yen, and itstrading volume more than tripled from average levels. Chiyodaholds Nisshin Kisen shares.   Nisshin Kisen confirmed that an investigation of the stocktrading is under way, but it declined any additional comment.Chiyoda Finance declined comment on the case, although itsspokesman pointed out that the official under investigationhas resigned. The former president, meanwhile, could not becontacted.   The activity surrounding Nisshin's stock in advance of theannouncement prompted the Finance Ministry and the Tokyoexchange to begin inquiries last June. But neither agency wasable to come up with anything to suggest that anyone hadrelied on advance knowledge of the stock issue to make aprofit. The main reason for their failure, officialscomplain, was their inability to demand assistance in theirinquiries from brokerage houses.   &quot;It would have been impossible&quot; for the Finance Ministryto know about any impropriety, because it lacks the legalpower to force clients to disclose the details of theirtransactions, says Katsuzo Wakabayashi, a director in theministry's securities bureau. &quot;We don't have the right tosearch&quot; for records as the Japanese police do, he says.   The president of the stock exchange also bemoans the lackof policing authority. &quot;There is a limit in our investigatingability,&quot; concedes Minoru Nagaoka, the president. But he saysthe exchange can monitor trading and try to discourageimproper activity. &quot;We want to exert more efforts tostrengthen our trading-screening function,&quot; he says.   As a result, some officials complain that theinsider-trading law -- implemented last April at the heightof a national stock scandal that eventually felled thegovernment of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita -- has donelittle to improve regulators' control over improper activityin the markets.   So far, though, nobody is calling for a revision of thelaw. One Finance Ministry official says market regulatorssimply will have to rely more on and cooperate more with thepolice. &quot;Of course we are willing to use them,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
