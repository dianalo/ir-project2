(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The B-2 stealth bomber is arevolutionary advancement in intercontinental bombers that was indevelopment for 18 years, Air Force officials say.   The B-2 was designed to evade detection by sophisticated enemyair defenses with an unorthodox design of curves and contours.   The stealth technology does not elude enemy radar so much asabsorb it, reflecting little radar energy back to ground receivers.   ``We're talking about an aircraft now that basically negates theair defenses built up in many many places around the world over manyyears,'' said Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, who directs research,development and testing of aerospace systems for the Air Force.   The flying wing design was first conceived in the 1940s byNorthrop Corp. founder Jack Northrop, although the YB-49 aircraft hebuilt was scrapped by the government in 1948 in favor of moreconventional bomber designs.   A factor leading to the demise of the YB-49 was a crash thatkilled air force test pilot Glen Edwards. The Mojave Desert airforce base that now bears his name has become a focus of advancedflight test research.   The history of the flying wing came full circle Monday, as theB-2 successfully completed its maiden flight and landed smoothly atEdwards.   The bomber is about 17 feet high and 69 feet long, only slightlylonger than an F-15 fighter.   The wingspan, however, is about 172 feet, almost the span of aB-52 bomber.   It is powered by four General Electric engines mounted on top ofthe wing. The Air Force says the engines were derived from thoseused in F-16 and F-14 fighters.   The bomber flies at subsonic speeds and is capable of hugging theterrain closely or flying as high as 50,000 feet, the Air Force said.   The B-2 has an operational range of more than 6,000 nauticalmiles at high altitudes and more than 10,000 nautical miles withaerial refueling capability.   The aircraft will carry both nuclear and conventional weapons,the Air Force said.   The two-hour test flight was conducted with the landing gearextended during the entire flight.   Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, 50, and copilot Air ForceCol. Richard S. Couch, 42, said they flew the bomber at three speedsand guided it through numerous turns to test its stability.   Couch described the B-2 as ``a very nimble aircraft'' and saidthe landing approach was ``rock'' steady.</TEXT></DOC>
