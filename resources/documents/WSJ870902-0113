As Vittorio Cassoni, the senior vice president who heads ATandamp;T's Data Systems division, promised last spring, ATandamp;T will unveil a desktop computer based on the Intel 80386 microprocessor called the 6386 WorkGroup System.    Most other major computer makers have announced such machines but, according to outsiders knowledgeable about the ATandamp;T product, ATandamp;T may be the first to announce a product that takes full advantage of the chip's ability to run eight software programs simultaneously and its ability to accommodate 32 users at the same time. Pricing is also competitive, analysts said, and ranges from $4,899 to $10,395, depending on the configuration.    Among 40 other new products and enhancements to existing products, ATandamp;T will also announce a new minicomputer, the 3B4000, aimed at the transaction-processing market. That is a $17 billion market growing about 17% a year, according to the Yankee Group consulting concern. Such machines are typically sold to airlines for reservation systems or to banks for automatic teller systems.    Industry consultants who saw the 3B4000 at a private showing of some of the new products yesterday said its architecture is impressive. But they added that it is unclear whether the price will be competitive. Consultants also said ATandamp;T may be overstating the computer's processing power.    Nonetheless, the product announcements overall show that ATandamp;T &quot;is getting more aggressive. Cassoni seems to be slowly getting things back on track,&quot; said John C. McCarthy, director of professional automation service at Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass. consulting firm.    &quot;Both these products (appear to be) the most well-thought-out products ATandamp;T has introduced in the computer business,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Though Mr. Grubman said it's still uncertain whether they will sell, he and industry consultants said ATandamp;T's desire to make them succeed may finally get Mr. Cassoni his own computer sales force.    Former executives have said that one reason ATandamp;T has failed so far at the computer business is because it doesn't have a sales force that is dedicated to selling only computers and that reports directly to the executive running the computer business. Currently, ATandamp;T sells its computers to big businesses through a sales force that also must sell communications gear and long-distance service. &quot;I think Cassoni will succeed in getting his own sales force,&quot; said Mr. Logan. &quot;Corporate management by now realizes they can't go out and sell computers by just saying, 'We're ATandamp;T.'&quot;    According to those familiar with the 6386 machine, it will be able to run application programs that use the Unix operating system, developed by ATandamp;T, concurrently with software running on MS-DOS, the Microsoft Corp. operating system popularized by International Business Machines Corp.    The new system will also run software based on the new OS/2 operating standard for IBM's new line of personal computers. While some analysts praised the machine, Mr. McCarthy called it &quot;muddled&quot; because it seemed to be neither a personal computer nor a powerful, multi-user minicomputer. </TEXT></DOC>
