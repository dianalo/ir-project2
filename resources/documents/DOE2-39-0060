<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0060 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experimental investigation, covering a Reynolds number range from 1900to 9800, was conducted to study the influence of a non-coplanar blockageon the velocity and turbulence intensity distributions in an unheated7x7 rod bundle. Using the blockage sleeves from a previous 61% coplanerblockage study, the non-coplanarity was obtained by axially staggeringthese sleeves in a prescribed manner. The results showed the introductionof non-coplanarity did not result in significant changes from the overallbundle flow behaviour with a coplanar blockage. The effect on the flowimmediately upstream and downstream of the blockage and within the blockagewas less pronounced, thereby resulting in a smaller degree of flow diversion.The blockage zone, despite being effectively longer than the coplanargeometry, did not seem to adversely influence the downstream flow recoveryprocess. Indeed the recovery to an undisturbed flow profile was morerapidly established. Complete flow recovery was attained for both thenon-coplanar and coplanar blockage geometries at the same axial locationin the rod bundle. Predictions from the COBRA subchannel computer codeagain agreed reasonably with the experimental data.</TEXT></DOC>
