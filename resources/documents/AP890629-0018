Ignoring their families' outrage and the war that separates theirpeople, Zaki el-Amoudi and Nurit Yehuda signed a marriage contracton a parked car in front of Nurit's aunt's apartment last year.   Since then, Nurit's family has abducted her several times _ andonce sent her to the United States _ and Jewish extremists havekidnapped the couple's baby daughter.   Only intervention by Israeli police and the FBI reunited thecouple and their daughter. A restraining order banning Nurit'sfamily from approaching their home has given the Palestinian``Romeo'' and Israeli ``Juliet'' a semblance of quiet.   Zaki said his story of love conquering hate should be a messageto the Israeli and Palestinian people.   ``My daughter was born in the middle of a war,'' said Zaki,sitting in his small, suburban apartment near Tel Aviv. ``It showshow much we need real peace.''   Zaki, 25, and Nurit, 24, met four years ago when they worked at achocolate factory near Tel Aviv.   ``I invited her for a cup of coffee, but she refused,'' Zakisaid, laughing.   He pursued the shy, quiet Nurit, and after two months she agreedto meet him after work in a park.   For more than a year, they met clandestinely until Nurit'sparents discovered their daughter was seeing a Palestinian from work.   Nurit said when she returned from a meeting with Zaki, ``Mymother began shouting at me and Moshe (her elder brother) slapped mein the face and shouted `From tomorrow on, you're not going towork!'''   Zaki said when his family found out about his Jewish girlfriend,they barged into his apartment. ``They wanted to break my legs andtake me home,'' he said.   Nurit's family forced her to quit her job, but the lovers managedto meet secretly for two more years.   Then ``we got the idea that if she was pregnant, her family wouldhave to accept us,'' Zaki said. ``But things became even worse.''   When Nurit's parents found out she was pregnant, they took herand hid her in her aunt's home north of Tel Aviv. Zaki found her andrushed to the house with a marriage contract, which the two loverssigned on the parked car.   Nurit's parents sent her to Baltimore, where they had hoped shewould have an abortion. But doctors refused to perform one when theydiscovered she was in her seventh month of pregnancy.   ``They thought that if we were apart our love would die and thebaby would be unnecessary,'' said Nurit.   When Zaki learned that Nurit was in Baltimore he called anIsraeli lawyer who contacted the FBI. He said the FBI forced theOrthodox Jewish family that was holding Nurit to allow her to returnto Israel.   Zaki and Nurit then moved to Khan Yunis, a town in the occupiedGaza Strip, to live with his family, which had become reconciled tothe idea of an Israeli-Arab marriage.   Nurit went into labor late one night when Gaza was under amilitary curfew.   ``I grabbed my brother and told him the pains had started and wehad to go,'' Zaki recalled.   He and his brother, Samir, took Nurit to a hospital, but whenZaki returned home he was stopped by soldiers at an army checkpoint.   ``I told them that my wife was pregnant, but I certainly didn'ttell them she was Jewish,'' he said.   The soldiers didn't listen and ordered Zaki to clear a roadblockset up by Palestinian protesters. That's where he was when hisdaughter, Lina, was born.   When the couple returned to Tel Aviv a month later, Nurit'sfamily again abducted their daughter along with the infant.   ``I called the aunt and she said, `We have Nurit, we have thebaby. Go to Gaza, go to hell,''' Zaki said.   Zaki took the case to court in April and won custody of hischild. But the family again seized Nurit, and Jewish extremistskidnapped the 2-month-old girl and gave her to Jewish settlers inthe occupied West Bank.   The baby was found only after police detained and questionedNurit's father, uncle and brother. A court then issued the orderbanning the Yehudas from approaching Nurit and Zaki's apartment.   ``I fought so hard because I loved her,'' Zaki said of the ordealto live in peace with his Jewish wife.   Nurit, who is pregnant again, said: ``We just want to raise ourchildren quietly.''</TEXT></DOC>
