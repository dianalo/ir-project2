(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL laid off 162 employees, shut down itsdinner theater and religious music service and cut back on its TVoperations this week as time and money continued running out forministry built by Jim Bakker.   The layoffs Wednesday were the second such mass dismissal in sixweeks. Financial problems have forced PTL to dismiss 66 percent ofits work force in the last year.   Earlier this week, PTL's new trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, saidin U.S. Bankruptcy Court that PTL might have to go off the air andcease all operations within weeks.   From last June, when it filed for reorganization under federalbankruptcy law, through the end of April, PTL had piled up $3.6million in operating deficits. It already owed as much as $130million in back debts.   Contributions have dropped steadily and dramatically in the lastsix weeks, since the IRS revoked PTL's tax-exempt status.   Among the operations shut down Wednesday at PTL's Heritage USAChristian theme park were, according to spokesman David West:   _The Heritage Grand Hotel's dinner theater, which drew 77,000patrons in 1986;   _Park Road Productions, which produced advertisements and otherservices for commercial television;   _PTL Publishing Co., which produced religious music.   ``This is a major blow,'' said singer Nancy Stainback. ``There'sonly four singers left and a rhythm section. There were many tearsshed this afternoon. It was like another death.''   The biggest cuts Wednesday came on the television side of theministry, an area that had not been cut seriously in previouslayoffs. About 50 of 100 employees lost their jobs, sources toldThe Charlotte, N.C., Observer.   ``Today hurt so bad I wasn't sure I could go on,'' said RonAldridge, host of ``The PTL Show.''   Heritage USA is for sale, although PTL hopes to salvage itsreligious functions, including its TV broadcasting, by spinningthem off in a separate non-profit entity to be called HeritageMinistries.   The ministry built by Bakker before his downfall in a sexscandal last year now has 509 full-time employees, compared to1,480 a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
