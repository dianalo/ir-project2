The Reagan administration appears eager to help reward Hungary for its record of asserting limited independence from Moscow. But it is less certain that U.S. companies will rush to transfer technology to the Eastern European nation.    The core of the package Hungary is trying to put together is a $300 million World Bank loan that would contain conditions requiring it to reduce subsidies, state ownership of business enterprises and other market-distorting practices.    The remaining $50 million would be a World Bank technology loan to finance an &quot;innovation park&quot; and other facilities designed to make Hungary one of the East bloc's leading exporters of integrated circuits, precision tools and other high-value electronic products.    But if the package is to generate the maximum benefits, Hungary has to obtain U.S. assurances of joint-venture investments, export financing and export licenses for American technology that usually is denied the Soviet bloc.    After meeting Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary C. William Verity last week, Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Jozsef Marjai seemed confident of U.S. support. &quot;They were definitely encouraging,&quot; Mr. Marjai said.    State Department aides confirmed the administration's intention to help. &quot;We have our own problems with the deficit and the weak dollar, but we're anxious to be responsive to Hungary and to keep the dialogue going,&quot; a spokesman said.    Helping Hungary is part of Washington's policy of encouraging Communist regimes to show independence from the Soviet Union, move toward market economies and improve their human-rights records. Hungary's economic reforms preceded those being implemented by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by more than two decades, but recently they have been hampered by bureaucratic inertia.    Mr. Marjai acknowledged that only one large Hungarian concern has been allowed to declare bankruptcy, despite Budapest's sink-or-swim policy for state-owned enterprises. But he has assured U.S. officials the reforms will regain momentum with the institution of personal income taxes and a weeding out of inefficient enterprises next year. &quot;By 1988, all state subsidies will cease to exist,&quot; he promised.    A streamlined economy and an improved technology base should also help Budapest increase its export earnings and ease its debt burden. Hungary currently devotes about 45% of its export income for servicing the $16 billion it owes abroad.    Although the World Bank won't finish negotiating the details of new loans to Budapest until early next year, officials don't see any major hitches. &quot;We have no outstanding problems with this program,&quot; asserted Eugenio Lari, director of the bank's European and Middle East division.    But World Bank loans won't automatically pull in more U.S. investments. &quot;We have over 100 joint ventures with Western firms but only eight with the U.S.,&quot; Mr. Marjai complained. However, Commerce Department officials said Mr. Verity has promised Mr. Marjai a growing trade with the U.S. and support for Hungary's efforts to streamline its economy.    Mr. Marjai has been pressing for the extension of Overseas Private Investment Corp. coverage for Hungary to lure more potential U.S. partners. The availability of political-risk insurance from this federally funded agency has helped both Yugoslavia and China attract American investment.    Agency officials said they have held &quot;preliminary discussions&quot; with Hungary. However, the agency needs congressional approval to provide the desired services.    Assuming the necessary export licenses are available, U.S. technology will be on top of Hungary's shopping list for the factory automation, semiconductor-manufacturing capability and software products to be acquired with World Bank financing.    The licensing problem will be tricky. The U.S. and its allies still restrict the export of advanced technology to the East bloc. However, for export-licensing purposes, the U.S. now treats Hungary and Poland slightly better than it does the Soviet Union, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.    A Commerce Department spokeswoman says such technology is exportable &quot;so long as it falls within certain quality thresholds and we are assured that it will be used only for peaceful purposes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
