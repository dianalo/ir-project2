Freeman said Thursday that the union would not participate inany buyout that includes current senior management of UAL   UAL management has not met with Machinists union leaders on thenew buyout proposal nor set a date for a meeting, Freeman said.   Although some managers have met with other employee unions,neither officials at the parent of United Airlines nor leaders ofthe airline's labor unions have offered many details.   Analysts say UAL management is seeking ironclad commitments fromlenders and the company's three major unions before publiclyannouncing the particulars of its revised buyout effort.   But one union official said Thursday the failure of a previousbid was prompting UAL's discretion.   The earlier buyout proposal accepted by UAL's board _ a$300-a-share, $6.75 billion deal involving UAL management, the7,000-member United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association andBritish Airways PLC _ collapsed in October when lenders refused tofinance it.   One factor in banks' wariness of financing the deal was thecontinued opposition of the Machinists.   ``A number of people were embarrassed with (the failure) of thefirst ESOP proposals. Most of the parties want to avoid that,''said Carol Holmes, the outgoing vice president of the 14,000-memberUnited Airlines unit of the Association of Flight Attendants.   UAL officials presented a revised employee buyout proposal toofficials of the flight attendants' union on Wednesday. Holmesrefused to provide details of the proposal but said she wouldoutline it for union members.   Meetings between UAL management and its 70,000 employees willcontinue for some time, said UAL spokesman Rob Doughty. Hedescribed the meetings as roundtable discussions, during whichemployees are asked for ideas on the buyout proposal.   ``It's our policy not to discuss matters that would affect thevalue or trading of our stock,'' he said, refusing to divulgedetails of the plan.   ``It also has long been our policy not to discuss labornegotiations,'' he said, noting the proposal addresses some issuesthat usually are covered in union contracts.   Industry analysts say they believe the revised management buyoutplan will value UAL at $210 to $240 a share, or a total of $4.75billion to $5.42 billion.   UAL stock traded at $176.50 a share at mid-day today, down 50cents from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
