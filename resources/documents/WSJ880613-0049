It wasn't entirely pleasant. &quot;My subordinates felt that I set impossibly high standards,&quot; Mr. Mounts recalls. &quot;That came as a total shock to me. I didn't understand. I really didn't expect that.&quot;    He says he has since tried to be &quot;more reasonable,&quot; but he adds: &quot;I really don't think my standards were so high.&quot;    Corporate managers increasingly are being put on the hot seat -- by the people who work for them. The technique isn't easy to administer and makes many managers uncomfortable. But proponents contend that it can help workers feel more involved in their company. And they argue that subordinates are uniquely situated to observe and evaluate their bosses for leadership, organization and crisis-management skills.    Subordinates &quot;see the individual on a day-to-day basis,&quot; says James Baughman, head of management-development programs for General Electric Co. &quot;They see him in good and bad times. They see how the individual hits for average, not just for home runs.&quot;    As a result, says H. John Bernardin, a management professor at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, subordinate feedback &quot;is probably more valid than the feedback from superiors.&quot;    Indeed, a 1984 study found that subordinates tend to rate their supervisor tougher than the supervisor's boss. One obvious reason, suggests the author, Michael K. Mount, a University of Iowa professor, is the setting: Subordinates don't have to evaluate their boss face-to-face.    &quot;In traditional appraisal you do,&quot; Prof. Mount says, &quot;so if you knew you had to sit down with him you'd probably be a little nicer.&quot;    But for many managers it's a radical departure from the typical &quot;top-down&quot; performance ratings. For that reason, many companies don't insist that managers share the evaluations with their bosses, and most companies don't use the subordinates' opinions to determine pay raises or promotions. &quot;It's awkward for an organization to give over part of its decision making to a group of people,&quot; says Tim Gartland, senior vice president for human resources at Citizens andamp; Southern Corp., an Atlanta bank holding company.    He says it also may be bad policy. One example: A boss may be unfairly penalized by bad ratings if those ratings resulted from his having to inflict heavy doses of discipline to turn around a poorly performing department.    Brian Davis, senior vice president of Personnel Decisions Inc., a Minneapolis consulting firm, adds that if pay or promotions are affected by reviews, managers would make business decisions or hire people with an eye toward getting positive ratings.    Subordinate reviews are also tricky to administer. Employees are typically skeptical of claims of anonymity and confidentiality and sometimes turn in bland, positive ratings. In other cases, the opposite happens: Employees conspire to gang up on a hated boss.    But the biggest stumbling block may be the managers themselves. Many of them can't handle criticism from subordinates. In fact, even proponents acknowledge that many managers who receive appraisals just shove the results in a drawer.    &quot;In theory it works fine but it takes a pretty strong employee-oriented environment to allow it to thrive,&quot; says Stephen Enna, senior vice president and personnel director for Wells Fargo andamp; Co.    For those reasons, most companies see the technique as a management-development tool -- a way for managers to learn and then remedy their weaknesses.    In a typical company, employees fill out questionnaires usually containing 100 or more questions. The results are tabulated by outside consultants, who then meet with the manager to explain the findings. These are softening up sessions -- strictly between the consultants and the managers -- designed to lessen the managers' defensiveness, as well as to motivate them to act on the results. &quot;I tell them to think about the findings as a gift from their subordinates,&quot; says Mr. Davis of Personnel Decisions. &quot;It may not fit but you never throw it back in their face.&quot;    But at most companies it's up to managers to do what they want with the results -- whether to throw them away or share them with bosses or subordinates.    Consultants recommend the latter, in part to give employees a sense of participation and also to serve as a stick for the managers. Robert Stringer, president of Sherbrooke Associates Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consultant, recalls one manager who had been raked over by subordinates as controlling and intrusive. After discussing the results with the manager, Mr. Stringer says he became convinced the boss was too rigid to change but arranged a meeting anyway with subordinates.    For the first 45 minutes, employees -- and the manager -- were tense and silent as Mr. Stringer ran through the results. Then one employee finally spoke and others soon jumped in. &quot;People just beat&quot; the daylights out of the manager, Mr. Stringer says.    It apparently worked. A new survey eight months later found the manager's rating on ability to delegate had jumped by 50%. &quot;Knowledge is 70% of the game,&quot; Mr. Stringer says.    For other managers, feedback lets them explain their thinking to subordinates. Thomas Field, president of DeVilbiss Co., a Toledo, Ohio, automobile-finishing equipment maker, says workers complained he piled too much work on them. He then explained to them that they were responsible for setting priorities and delegating.    To ensure that managers respond to feedback, some companies have formalized the follow-up. At General Electric, for instance, about 5,000 employees a year take a six day management development course after they receive confidential written feedback from subordinates and peers. At Southern California Edison Co., managers are asked to prepare an &quot;individual development plan&quot; after get ting feedback from subordinates and peers.    Michael Sheean, an organizational consultant for the company, recalls a high-level manager whose brilliance and remoteness overwhelmed and intimidated his subordinates. He was so shocked at subordinates' low ratings of him that he methodically made a list of dozens of tasks to do daily.    For instance, he decided to take a different route from the elevator to his office each day so he could say hello to different colleagues. His hardest task: He would apologize to everyone he had ignored or stepped on unintentionally in the past. And to monitor his behavior he designated a few strong-willed subordinates as &quot;special counselors&quot; from whom he would seek regular feed back on his behavior.    Mr. Sheean says subordinate feedback helps defeat managers' impulse to &quot;deny and selectively believe what they choose to believe. This comes right at you.&quot;    Of course all managers aren't so willing to change. A manager whose style has remained fixed for 35 years isn't going to react well if he is told he isn't a good listener, says Byron Quandt, vice president of human resources for Libbey-Owens-Ford Co. &quot;He'll say, 'You're full of it and I'm not going to change,'&quot; he says.    Mr. Stringer recalls an executive whose terrible interpersonal skills were confirmed by subordinates' ratings. &quot;He had low regard for people; he was very critical in public; he was clumsy, insensitive,&quot; he says.    At a meeting with subordinates, he sat silently, so they clammed up. He later told Mr. Stringer, &quot;I think this is b.s.&quot; He also justified his actions, insisting subordinates didn't understand the demands placed on him by his boss. And he later tried to figure out which subordinate said which criticism. &quot;Basically,&quot; says Mr. Stringer, &quot;he saw the whole thing as an attack on him.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
