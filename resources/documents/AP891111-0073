A one-month stretch of unusually cold weather in certain regionscould, however, trigger some localized shortages of natural gas toindustrial and other non-residential users such as schools andbusinesses, the officials said in interviews.   Supplies of heating oil, used mainly in the Northeast, are notin doubt, although prices are expected to be at least a few cents agallon higher than last winter.   The projected rise in heating oil prices is linked to higherprices for the petroleum from which the fuel is made. Natural gasprices, which currently are lower than a year ago, are expected toincrease as demand rises and local distribution companies passalong a projected small increase in their own costs.   The government estimates that retail heating oil prices willaverage about 90 cents a gallon this winter, compared with about 82cents a gallon a year earlier. Prices usually vary across regions,depending on weather patterns and other factors.   About 12 million American homes burn oil for heat, and anadditional 48 million heat with natural gas.   Because gas distribution companies are getting more of theirsupply on the spot, or non-contract, market and less from thetraditional pipeline contract system, price trends and thereliability of supplies are getting harder to foresee, analysts say.   Paul Taylor, a vice president at Anadarko Petroleum Corp., aHouston-based gas producer, said the number of companies forced totemporarily curtail gas shipments to their customers has beengrowing in recent years. Cutbacks were imposed in parts ofCalifornia and Texas on the coldest days two years ago, and lastwinter Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Texas and California wereaffected, he said.   ``We look at that as evidence of a growing trend: On the coldestwinter days there just is not enough gas around to meet everyone'sdemands,'' he said, adding that the main problem is a seasonalbottleneck in some pipeline systems.   Taylor noted that supply cutbacks are imposed on industrialusers first and have not yet affected residential users. Nor arethey likely to this winter, he said.   In a sign that the industry itself is becoming more concernedabout its capability to deliver adequate supplies of natural gas,marketers are starting to move away from cheaper month-to-monthspot market purchases to the more dependable _ yet more expensive _long-term supply contracts, said Kenneth Randolph, senior vicepresident and general counsel of the Natural Gas Clearinghouse.   ``There's still that possibility of running short of gas, nextyear or even this year,'' Randolph said. However, the odds weighheavily in favor of a stable market at least for the coming winter,unless the weather is exceptionally cold for an extended period inboth producing and consuming states, he said.   The federal Energy Information Administration this monthslightly increased its forecast for natural gas prices but saysconsumers shouldn't worry about supplies.   The agency's latest forecast says residential natural gas pricesare likely to rise about 2 percent this winter, to an average perthousand cubic feet of $5.57, compared with $5.48 in the sameperiod last year.   Commercial inventories of natural gas are higher now than a yearago, and despite possible pipeline bottlenecks there is littlereason to expect a serious supply problem, said Calvin Kilgore,director of the agency's energy markets office.   ``It's a manageable situation,'' he said.   The American Gas Association, a trade group of gas distributorsand pipeline companies, projects a 5.9 percent jump in residentialgas prices this winter compared with last year, assuming theweather is neither unusually harsh nor mild.   The association said that while gas supplies should be adequate,transportation bottlenecks and weather uncertainties could causeprices to move erratically.   ``During short periods in localized areas, this could evenresult in physical delivery constraints on getting gas,'' theassociation said in a recent report.</TEXT></DOC>
