Participants stated that due toa high rate of energy consumption increase in Poland coal exports inthe coming years will depend on energy conservation, investment and moreeconomic use of developed coal reserves. Recommendations for researchprograms in coal deposit geology in Poland were made.</TEXT></DOC>
