Those who have watched the six-year effort to reach an agreement on the missiles say Mr. Gorbachev's sudden reluctance may be a last ditch effort to exploit what he sees as growing weakness in the Reagan administration and differences among U.S. allies.    &quot;It was always in the cards he (Mr. Gorbachev) would do this,&quot; says Jonathan Luxmoore of London's Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies. The Soviet leader postponed the summit, Mr. Luxmoore suggests, to try to force President Reagan to make concessions on his Strategic Defense Initiative, the so-called Star Wars space-based missile defense system. &quot;Gorbachev thinks he can play one last card before the whole (INF treaty) goes through,&quot; Mr. Luxmoore says.    Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations, agrees that the stock market crash and U.S. problems in the Persian Gulf may have tempted Mr. Gorbachev to try to wring more concessions out of the West. But it probably won't work, he says.    &quot;Gorbachev miscalculated,&quot; says Mr. Moisi. &quot;He shot too high. He figured that Reagan was weaker and more in need than ever of an agreement at any price.&quot; The Soviet leader, says Mr. Moisi, saw &quot;the (market) crash, Bork, the gulf and the general disarray in the IReagane administration&quot; as a chance to take another shot at Star Wars.    Mr. Gorbachev, who re-emphasized his objections to SDI at last week's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, didn't appear to dent North Atlantic Treaty Organization optimism that agreement on intermediate-range missiles is near. The agreement would remove from Europe nuclear-tipped missiles with a range of between 310 miles and 3,415 miles.    In Brussels over the weekend, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the &quot;Soviet failure to agree to a summit date is obviously something of a disappointment,&quot; because &quot;it was precisely at Soviet initiative&quot; that a summit date was expected to be set last week.    Even so, Sir Geoffrey said an INF treaty &quot;is almost in the bag, precisely along the lines sought by NATO from the outset. The conditions do therefore exist for a breakthrough on arms control and in East-West relations. Just how far and how fast those can be exploited depend upon Mr. Gorbachev's willingness to remove the last minute obstacle to an early summit. The ball is obviously and clearly in Moscow's court.&quot;    Observers differ over whether a summit need accompany the INF agreement. &quot;The treaties don't have to be signed at a summit,&quot; says John Roper, an analyst at London's Royal Institute of International Affairs. &quot;They don't even have to be signed by heads of government.&quot;    But Mr. Moisi believes that &quot;to have an agreement without a summit would be strange because it wouldn't fit with what both sides are up to. The Soviets want to show their new openness, the Reagan administration needs a win.&quot;    French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond, speaking after the Shultz briefing in Brussels, said that while Mr. Shultz insisted that the Moscow meeting wasn't at all a failure, &quot;it was something of a failure.&quot; The French government, while officially welcoming the double-zero agreement, has never been enthusiastic about it. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac still worries it will leave a conventional imbalance that won't be closed soon. But he hasn't publicly criticized the agreement.    Among experts, there is suspicion that Mr. Gorbachev's reluctance may also be an attempt to exploit lingering but unstated differences among the Western powers over just how good a deal the intermediate-range agreement is.    Friedhelm Ost, chief spokesman for the West German government, told reporters yesterday that his government was confident that, despite the summit problem, the missile agreement would be completed in the &quot;next few weeks and that it will be signed this year.&quot;    But in West Germany, behind-the-scenes concern continues over the political problems posed by those nuclear weapons the agreement doesn't cover-short-range bombs, artillery shells and missiles, all of which would explode in or near West Germany in a nuclear exchange.    In France, Mr. Moisi says there is considerable internal opposition to an INF agreement because the removal of some nuclear weapons would leave the West facing the Warsaw Pact's more potent conventional forces.    Referring to Mr. Gorbachev's refusal to fix a date for a summit, Mr. Moisi says: &quot;Deep down the French government is very happy, though it can't say so openly. To do so would hurt the Germans, anger the Americans and probably not please public opinion at home.&quot; French officials, he says, &quot;would like to see the missile agreement delayed as long as possible.&quot;    Enrico Jacchia, director of the Center for Strategic Studies at the Free University of Rome, says he believes Mr. Gorbachev's reluctance to come to a summit was partly related to an attempt to drive a harder bargain with the West and partly to assuage lingering doubts in the Soviet hierarchy.    Verification procedures under the pending missile agreement would allow U.S. inspection teams to visit suspected missile sites in the Soviet Union, he notes, while most Soviet inspection visits would be confined to Europe.    &quot;To the Russian military this looks unbalanced,&quot; says Mr. Jacchia. &quot;Gorbachev may be looking for sweeteners he can show to his generals.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
