Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The dispute involves an amendment proposed by Alfonse D'Amato,R-N.Y., which would permit the death penalty for drug dealersconvicted of killing people.   ``We don't want to be the fly in the ointment'' delaying finalaction on the bill, said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.   But he said D'Amato and other supporters of the death penaltyplan would not drop their amendment until they were assured it willbe considered at a later date.   D'Amato complained that because of filibusters threatened byopponents, ``we've been unable to get a straight vote on whetherthe death penalty should be imposed.''   The two sides were trying to agree on a compromise, but no finalaction on the bill will be taken before Wednesday morning, SenateMajority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said PresidentReagan will talk about the drug problem in a commencement addressWednesday at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., and saidthe president wants the nation ``to depoliticize the drug policydebate.''   ``I think the president hopes that people will be careful andrealistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort,''Fitzwater said. ``Everybody wants to out-drug each other in termsof political rhetoric.''   Reagan is ``very frustrated'' with the progress of anti-drugabuse efforts, the spokesman added.   The bill authorizes Pentagon spending of $299.5 billion in thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and includes a trio of anti-drugprovisions overwhelmingly added by senators who contend the U.S.public wants sterner action to halt illegal drug-trafficking.   Two of the provisions were approved Tuesday in the wake ofreports that the administration was willing to dropdrug-trafficking charges against Noriega if he steps down.   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, but he hasrefused to quit. U.S. economic sanctions have thus far beenineffective in forcing him out.   The Senate voted 95-0 approval of an amendment by Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., which provides that no U.S. aid be sent to Panamauntil Noriega leaves power and until Reagan certifies that noSoviet or Cuban troops are in the Central American nation.   Then the Senate passed, 86-10, a resolution offered by Dolewhich put the Senate on record as opposing any deal in which U.S.drug-trafficking charges would be dropped.   Dole said ``we'd be making a mistake'' by dropping theindictments. The White House opposed his non-binding resolution, hetold his colleagues.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., agreed with Dole. ``A deal thatwould allow this man to escape justice is a deal that stinks,'' hesaid.   The American effort to remove Noriega ``was not merelyineffective,'' said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., ``I believe theywork against the return of democracy to Panama. The indictmentsshould be left in place.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said ``the administration has painted itself and ournation into the corner on this matter.''   The main anti-drug provision was added last week by the Senate,which voted 83-6 to give the military a bigger role in stopping theflow of illegal drugs into the country, including new arrest powersfor Navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats onthe high seas.   Senate passage would send the bill to a House-Senate conferencecommittee to be reconciled with the Pentagon budget bill passedlast week by the House.   The House also added an anti-drug provision, but it was morefar-reaching that the Senate bill. The House ordered Reagan to havethe military basically seal off U.S. borders against illegaldrug-trafficking.   Both bills authorize $299.5 billion for the Pentagon, whichwould essentially freeze defense spending for a fourth straightyear after large Pentagon budget increases during Reagan's firstterm.   That was the amount approved by Reagan last December in anagreement with congressional leaders on a spending package designedto reduce federal budget deficits. The Pentagon had expected to getabout $333 billion for defense next year.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci achieved the lower defensebudget by ordering cuts of about 34,000 personnel from thePentagon's civilian work force, along with retiring a number ofolder weapons, including 16 aging Navy frigates.   One difference to be resolved by the conference committee willbe the question of a pay raise for the nation's 2.1 millionuniformed military personnel. The House proposed a 4 percentincrease, while the Senate measure includes the entire 4.3 percenthike originally sought by Reagan.   Another difference involves spending for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, as Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile program is knownformally.   The House proposed $3.5 billion for Star Wars, while the Senatebill authorizes $4.6 billion. Reagan had sought $4.8 billion,compared with the current $3.9 billion SDI budget.</TEXT></DOC>
