Inthe present method, it is assumed that the radial concentration profilecan be expressed in the form of multi-term expansion, and the two-dimensionalpartial differential equation is transformed into a set of ordinary differentialequations through the multiple integration in the radial direction. Computationsare made on UF/sub 6/ gas in various types of centrifuges which havethe ports for feed, product, and waste on the end plates. The resultsof the present analysis are compared with the other results of existingtheoretical analysis. In spite of the approximate approach, the presentmethod can provide a closer agreement with the two-dimensional finitedifference method (FDM) proposed by Kai. Finally, it is shown that theresults of the present analysis agree with the experimental data of Beamset al., using the internal flow pattern based on the boundary layer theoryby Nakayama et al.</TEXT></DOC>
