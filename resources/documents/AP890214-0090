The Commerce Department said sales rose last month to aseasonally adjusted $138.9 billion. That followed a revised 0.1percent decrease in December and a 1.3 percent increase in November.   ``Consumers were in a pretty good mood when they startedJanuary,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. inNew York. ``Good weather got them into shopping malls and they werespending money. Despite higher interest rates, they did not feelpinched.''   January's increase was bolstered by a 1.7 percent increase in theimportant general merchandise category, which includes departmentstores. Sales in that category had inched up 0.1 percent in December.   Major department store chains reported their January sales hadbeen aided by mild winter weather, which encouraged shoppers andadded to sales volume. In addition, lean inventories resulted inhigher prices, which boosted overall sales figures.   Some analysts said the latest retail sales report, coupled withother evidence of strong economic growth at the start of the year,could lead the Federal Reserve Board to continue to nudge upinterest rates in its ongoing effort to slow the economy and keepinflation in check.   ``The economy will continue to exceed the speed limit, onaverage, in the quarter ahead,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chiefeconomist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The Federal Reservewill have to move toward further restraint.''   The unexpectedly strong January sales performance came despite a0.9 percent drop in car sales, which followed a 0.4 percent dip inDecember. Sales had weakened in early January as manufacturers endedsteep year-end discounts.   Excluding autos, which account for about one-fourth of the retailtotal, sales in January were up 1 percent, following an unchangedsales pace in December.   ``People are making a lot of money and they're feeling very goodand they're still going out there buying,'' said economist SandraShaber of the Futures Group in Washington. ``I suspect that is goingto continue happening until the economy runs out of steam. We can'tcount on the consumer to slow the economy down.''   Steinberg predicted the pace of retail sales would decrease laterthis year as consumer spending is restrained by a slowdown inemployment gains and by higher interest rates, including risingmonthly payments for homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages.   Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic healthbecause it represents about one-third of the gross national product.   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to lastthree or more years, edged up 0.1 percent in January after anidentical rise in December. Non-durable goods surged 0.8 percentafter dropping 0.2 percent during the previous month.   The only merchandise category besides autos to record a decreasein January was clothing and accessory stores, where sales fell 1.1percent.   Drugs stores reported a 2.9 percent increase in sales after a 2.7percent decrease in December. Sales at restaurants and bars were up1.2 percent after a 1.1 percent increase during the previous month.   Furniture and home furnishing sales were up 0.4 percent inJanuary after a 1.1 percent drop in December. Sales of hardware andbuilding supplies rose 1.4 percent after a 2 percent increase theprevious month.   Grocery and other food store sales were up 1 percent after a 0.9percent drop. Gasoline station sales also were up 1 percent lastmonth after the same increase the previous month.</TEXT></DOC>
