Beer company employees and distributors also have been asked tolet Congress know about their oppostion to a beer tax hike whilelawmakers were home for Independence Day parades and otherfestivities.   The lobbying offensive comes even though no specific proposal toboost the excise tax on beer has been offered.   But brewers, who already have been under attack in the nation'scapital for questionable marketing tactics, are fearful that beerwill prove a handy target for lawmakers struggling to balance thefederal budget.   ``When they talk about taxes, the first thing they talk aboutare alcohol taxes,'' said Jeff Becker, a spokesman for the BeerInstitute, a trade group.   Brewers say an increase in the tax on beer unfairly would hitmiddle- and low-income families because they drink most beer.   The federal excise tax on beer amounts to $9 a barrel or about16 cents for a six-pack. The federal rate has not been changedsince 1951 although state rates have been raised.   Industry executives expect proposals may be made to double thefederal excise tax on beer. The Beer Institute estimates doublingthe federal tax would cut beer sales volume by 4 percent at retail.   The beer industry sold 188 million barrels of beer in 1989, andexpectations are that sales will rise less than 1 percent thisyear. Annual sales growth has been averaging 0.6 pecent to 0.7percent a year for the past five years, the institute said.   The largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch Cos., recently distributedpetitions to its 960 wholesalers, which it encouraged to gatherthousands of signatures from people who want lawmakers to ``Can theBeer Tax.''   Signatures were collected over the past week at concerts andfestivals in several Texas cities. Also this past week, theConnecticut beer wholesaler association hired a plane to carry abanner with the ``Can the Beer Tax'' slogan along the coast.   Anheuser-Busch is considering developing radio and newspaper adsthat would use the same theme.   Company Chairman August A. Busch III encouraged employees lastmonth to buttonhole legislators on the tax issue while thelawmakers were in their home districts for the July 4th holiday andto send letters to their Washington offices so they would bereminded of those views when they returned.   ``The next several days are key,'' Busch wrote.   Steven Forsyth, a spokesman for Miller Brewing Co. in Milwaukee,said Miller sent letters and packets of information to itsemployees and suppliers detailing the company's opposition to abeer tax hike.   He said they and the company's 700 distributors were also asked``let congresspeople know that we believe excise taxes are unfair''and will have little impact on closing the budget defiucit.   On Monday, The Beer Institute plans to run ads in 65 newspapersthat will show a fancy diamond bracelet and a can of beer above theheadline ``You pay more excise tax on the beer.''   The ad points out that federal excise taxes on luxury items suchas jewelry were eliminated while beer is taxed at three times therate of most other consumer goods.   ``As one of America's 80 million beer drinkers, tell Congressyou don't mind paying your fair share of taxes. But enough isenough,'' the ad says.   The ads are being placed in areas represented by senators andHouse members expected to be influential in the upcoming talksbetween Congress and the White House on a deficit reduction plan.   The ads list a toll-free telephone number and the instituteplans to send letters under the caller's name to his or herlegislator, expressing opposition to any hike in the beer tax.   In his letter to Anheuser-Busch employees, Busch warned a beertax increase would hurt the company and the industry for years tocome.   ``No one at Anheuser-Busch is against even-handed efforts tocurb the federal deficit. We are all willing to do our part. Butexcise taxes are anything but even-handed,'' he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
