The June record net buying figure of $12.34 billion for foreign bonds by Japanese, however, was revised downward from a preliminary estimate made by officials in June. At the time, early results showed the total would weigh in at $14.1 billion. In May, the net buying figure totaled $5.47 billion.    During the latest reporting month, Japanese investors bought $129.14 billion and sold $116.81 billion.    The estimate was based on reported plans by Japanese investors to buy or sell bonds during the month, and there were last-minute contract changes that altered the basis of the original prediction, an official explained.    The previous net foreign bond buying record was $11.01 billion, set in April 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
