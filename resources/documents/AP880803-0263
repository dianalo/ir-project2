It is an old story, but with exceptions, and this is about oneof them.   Value Line, founded during the Great Depression of the 1930s,persists more than a half-century later as the biggest of alladvisory services, claiming 120,000 individual and institutionalsubscribers, most at $495 a year.   ``It survives because of the system,'' says Samuel Eisenstadt,who helped devise it.   The system is influenced little, if at all, by preferences ornotions. Nobody would dare tamper with it or adjust it to suit awhim. The system is held sacred; it is the founder's legacy.   Some advisory services rely heavily on the elan of oneindividual. But relatively few subscribers knew Arnold Bernhard,Value Line's founder. He preferred it that way; the system was theproduct.   Thus, when Bernhard died late in 1987 no changes were made inthe service, any more than Ford automobiles were redesigned becauseHenry Ford died, or the formula for steel was changed when AndrewCarnegie passed away.   The Value Line Investment Survey relies on cross-sectionalanalyses of 1,700 stocks _ each measured against others and againstitself over periods of time _ to produce a numerical assessment ofboth timeliness and safety.   While Bernhard, who began the service after losing his job in1931, worked relentlessly on his system for the first 15 years, ithas changed little since 1946.   Each stock's timeliness score is determined by a history ofprice and earnings for 10 years; price momentum or the recentaction of the stock; earnings momentum; and an earnings surprisefactor.   The universe of roughly 1,700 stocks is then divided. Onehundred stocks earn a ``1'' or top rating. Three hundred stocksfall into category 2, more than 800 into category 3, 300 intocategory 4 and 100 into ``5,'' the lowest.   Safety rankings are another matter entirely, determined mainlyby price stability of the stock and other financial factors. Manystocks earn different ratings for timeliness and safety. A safetyrating of ``1,'' for instance, might be accompanied by a ``3'' fortimeliness.   Eisenstadt, who inherited Bernhard's title of research chairman,states that the stocks rated highest for timeliness appreciated15,400 percent from April 16, 1965, to June 30, 1987, not includingdividends or transactions costs.   In the same period, he states, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockaverage rose 245 percent.   It is through measurements of this sort, over varying periods oftime, that Value Line claims to be an anomaly, a contradiction ofthe efficient market hypothesis, a favorite topic of academics.   In an efficient market, so goes the thinking, any availablemarket information is so quickly reflected in stock prices that noattempt to beat the market can be successful in the long run.   Value Line claims otherwise. Eisenstadt says the service'snumber 1 stock ratings have outperformed market averages for morethan 21 years, showing average annual appreciation of 25.8 percent.Armed with such data, he has often debated the academics, andsometimes has won concessions from them.   While the system uses complex statistical techniques, all theinformation is publicly available, if not perhaps easilyaccessible. And for those who seek to avoid clutter, the numericalratings are amazingly easy to use.   ``It's a concept even children can understand,'' says JeanBernhard Buttner, the founder's daughter and now president andchief operating officer.   ``Anyone who can count to five can easily and profitably use thesystem.''</TEXT></DOC>
