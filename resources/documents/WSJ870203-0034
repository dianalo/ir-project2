About $102 million of debt is affected. Brunswick, a Skokie, Ill.-based boat engine and recreational products company, spun off Ozite in the late 1970s but is still guarantor of $500,000 of Ozite debt. Moody's placed the long-term debt ratings of Brunswick under review for possible downgrade in December. The rating concern said it took action because of the substantial increase in leverage that resulted from the company's $774 million purchase of two pleasure-boat makers. Moody's said it believes that the company's debt protection measurements will remain adequate and improve over the next few years because of its sizable cash flow, which should allow Brunswick to gradually decrease its leverage, barring further major acquisitions. A Brunswick spokesman said, &quot;We are confident we will be able to service our temporarily higher-than-normal debt level and are committed to actions which will restore the higher credit rating which we have enjoyed.&quot;    ---   SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT -- Moody's lowered ratings on about $2 billion of the district's debt. Moody's said it downgraded electric revenue bonds to Baa-1 from single-A, subordinated electric revenue bonds to Baa from single-A, general-obligation unlimited tax bonds to single-A from single-A-1 and South Sutter Water District Camp Far West hydroelectric revenue bonds to Baa-1 from single-A. The rating concern cited &quot;the uncertainties associated with an aggressive schedule&quot; for the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant's restarting and a &quot;need to stabilize overall operations in a now more difficult environment.&quot; A spokesman for the utility district said it was &quot;quite disappointed&quot; with Moody's action, believing it had convinced Moody's that its financial outlook had &quot;indeed brightened&quot; during a recent presentation. </TEXT></DOC>
