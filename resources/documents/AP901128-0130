He said Iraqi officials assured them it would be at least 14,and allowed them to pick their departure date.rivategroups and industry ``to utilize a wide variety of approaches tomeet housing needs,'' the White House said.   Other provisions include:   - Increasing public housing grants to $160 million for drugelimination efforts and youth sports programs.   - Reauthorizing the McKinney Act programs for the homeless.   - Emphasizing government assistance for rehabilitation over newconstruction, and requiring higher state and local contributionswhere new construction of public housing is deemed necessary.   - Federal Housing Administration assessment of new annualpremium on borrowers of FHA-backed loans that increases minimumupfront closing costs.   - Combining housing assistance with support services for theelderly.   ``The National Affordable Housing Act gives people the best kindof government assistance - it provides opportunity and itencourages responsibility without the shackles of dependency,''Bush said Wednesday.''We want public housing to become aspringboard for independence, not a bottomless pit fordependency.''   The White House and Housing and Urban Development Secretary JackKemp have touted their new housing program as an example of how to``empower'' the poor to help themselves.   ``A cornerstone of our effort to reduce the heavy hand ofgovernment is this idea of empowering people, not bureaucracies,''Bush said in a signing ceremony in the East Room.   ``Empowerment'' is a theme that has generated controversy withinthe administration, with Richard Darman, director of the Office ofManagement and Budget, recently dismissing it in a speech as ameaningless catch phrase.   But Bush has set up within his Domestic Policy Council a taskforce on empowerment, chaired by Kemp.   The general philosophy, say those involved, is to give peopletools to help themselves, rather than having government socialprograms do it for them.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesdaywhat Bush thinks of the apparent rift between conservatives withinthe administration who are pushing empowerment and those who poohpooh it as mere rhetoric, responded: ``We're all one big happyfamily here, everybody is working together.''   Earlier Wednesday, Kemp briefed members of the Domestic PolicyCouncil on possible initiatives under consideration for the Stateof the Union address and fiscal 1992 budget. Kemp has been alongtime backer of housing vouchers and other self-help programsfor the poor.   Among the administration officials who attended the briefingwere Vice President Dan Quayle, Darman, and White House chief ofstaff John Sununu.</TEXT></DOC>
