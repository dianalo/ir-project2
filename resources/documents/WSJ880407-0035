Volume is expected to fall 20% to 25% from last year's $435 billion of new mortgages on single-family residences. One reason: Most people with old high-interest mortgages already have refinanced, says Timothy Howard, chief economist for Federal National Mortgage Association. In addition, rates have risen from last year.    Following two banner years for mortgage originations, many lenders find themselves with excess capacity. Some plan to cut fees on mortgages more aggressively to gain market share and avoid layoffs; others already are trimming payrolls. One place where banks hope to recoup some of the price-cutting is in higher fees for servicing mortgages sold to investors.    Despite the lower mortgage volume, Robert Horner, chairman of Citicorp Mortgage, calls 1988 &quot;the third year of a pretty incredible mortgage market.&quot;    ADVERSE COURT RULINGS against banks prompt new lending caution.    Borrowers who get into trouble increasingly are suing lenders, claiming faulty performance. Last year, juries levied damages of more than $135 million in three cases of lender liability. Joseph Ricci, a Maine businessman, settled for $10 million cash and a $5 million loan from Key Bancshares of Maine. The bank had terminated Mr. Ricci's credit in 1982 after an FBI agent mistakenly linked him to organized crime.    &quot;The issue of lender liability is being raised in virtually every problem loan,&quot; says Maury Poscover, a St. Louis attorney. One result: banks now are using &quot;litigation audits&quot; to spot potential problems in their loan policies, record-keeping and the way they treat borrowers. &quot;Lenders are just going to have to adjust to the changes in standards courts are applying to them,&quot; says Richard C. Tufaro, a New York lawyer.    BIG U.S. BANKS may have to shrink to satisfy new capital standards.    Proposed international standards are designed to bolster the safety of the world financial system and &quot;level the playing field&quot; among banks. But some of the 100 largest U.S. banks will have to strain to comply. By one estimate, big U.S. banks need to raise $7 billion in new capital by 1992. If investors remain cool toward big-bank stocks, banks may be left with little choice but to trim their size.    The proposed standards &quot;would have a devastating impact on the international competitiveness of the largest American banks,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer, (D., N.Y.). Privately, one banker accuses the Federal Reserve Board of &quot;betraying&quot; U.S. banks, which have lost some ground to Japanese banks in recent years. Bankers are prodding the Fed to be a tougher bargainer when the central bankers for the 12 industrialized nations reconvene for the final round of talks in June.    U.S. banks want to be able to include in capital preferred stock and good will, the premium paid on acquisitions.    JAPANESE BANKS hold more than 9% of U.S. banking assets, compared with 5% in 1982, according to Loan Pricing Corp., New York. One reason is aggressive pricing. But new bank capital requirements are making insurance companies the new low bidders on the market, bankers say.    TO COPE WITH THE CLOSING of a Manufacturers Hanover Trust branch, residents of New York's Lower East Side organized a credit union with $100,000 in seed money from Manufacturers. With 1,025 members and $800,000 in assets, it will begin offering checking accounts this fall.    STUDENT LOANS give lenders second thoughts, as the government weighs another cut in the spread lenders earn on the loans. Some 56% of the 123 largest student lenders would slash their programs or drop out completely if the spread is trimmed again, says a Consumer Bankers Association survey.    VISA AND MASTERCARD hunt harder for new cardholders.    More than 79 million Americans now carry an average of 2.9 bank credit cards, according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. That represents about 93% of the potential number of cardholders based on current marketing standards. To corral more U.S. cardholders, banks would have to lower their credit standards -- an unlikely move given current fears of recession.    Visa and MasterCard increasingly look overseas. &quot;We see the Continent becoming one mass market for us,&quot; says Russell Hogg, MasterCard president. His company recently purchased 15% of Eurocard and its processing business. Last year, 40% of Visa and MasterCard charge volume came from outside the U.S. Nilson projects that foreign charge volume will surpass U.S. levels in 1989, and by 1995 it will be 50% larger than U.S. volume.    The Soviet government tourism agency recently won permission to issue Visa cards to foreign nationals residing there and Russians who travel abroad.
