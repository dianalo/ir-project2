Solar-power units stationed in space would be moreefficient than ground-based photovoltaic-power systems,officials told a Japanese news agency. They explained thatwhile much of the sun's energy is filtered out by the Earth'satmosphere and clouds, that wouldn't happen in space.   The project envisions a generator equipped with asolar-panel unit in geostationary orbit. A panel unit ofthree to six square miles would generate five millionkilowatts, roughly equivalent to the output of about fivenuclear-power stations, the officials said.   Energy captured by the solar-panel unit would be sent bymicrowave signals or laser to a ground-based receiver.

Shipyard restrictions on vessels from the SovietUnion and other East bloc countries were imposed in 1982 atthe request of the U.S.                                                                                                          MONKEY BUSINESS                                                                                                          An Australian city is considering using monkeys to pickcoconuts from trees along its seafront walk to prevent thenuts from falling on tourists. &quot;They'd splatter you if theyhit you. It's bloody frightening,&quot; said Les Bass, a spokesmanfor palm-fringed Cairns City Council in northeast Australia.Using monkeys, possibly from Malaysia, was proposed byAlderman Bob Burgess, who suggested they would amuse touristswhile protecting sightseers and picnickers from lethal crackson the head.                                                                                                          SAMSUNG PLAN REJECTED                                                                                                          The South Korean Trade and Industry Ministry rejected aplan by Samsung Shipbuilding andamp; Heavy Industries Co. toproduce large trucks using Japanese technology. Ministryofficials said the application to introduce technology fromNissan Diesel Motor Co. would be returned to Samsung.

Mrs. Orsoo, winner of a red starmedal, said families of eight or more also get $300 a year ingovernment subsidies, a princely sum in Mongolia.   Mongolia's communist rulers until recently prohibitedbirth control. Activists, such as prominent pediatrician andpublic health official Munkhuu, have pushed the authoritiesin the past year to legalize contraceptives, saying Mongolianwomen are risking their health because they have too manybabies too quickly. Legalization of contraception is one ofmany reforms instituted since March, when demonstrationsforced the communists to renounce their monopoly on power.   However, official approval of large families remainsunchanged. &quot;Our birth-control policy was and is one ofencouraging population growth, because our population is sosmall,&quot; Mr. Munkhuu said.   Mongolia, a country the size of Western Europe, has apopulation of only two million. Its birthrate is high at 36births per 1,000 people, and the average family has aboutfive children.
