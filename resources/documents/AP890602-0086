(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man who unplugged his comatose son froma life-support system at gunpoint six weeks ago has been releasedfrom a hospital after being treated for a violent reaction to anillegal drug, officials said.   Rudy Linares, a 23-year-old house painter, was dischargedThursday afternoon after undergoing a series of medicalevaluations, said Diane Lux, a spokeswoman for MacNeal MemorialHospital in Berwyn.   Linares was admitted to the hospital early Thursday afterparamedics and police handcuffed him and forcibly transported himthere from his home, police said. He was not immediately chargedbut authorities said he could face drug or parole violation charges.   ``Mr. Linares told one of the officers he'd taken some badPCP,'' said Steve Zalas, Cicero deputy police superintendent. ``Hewas kind of combative.'' PCP, or angel dust, is a street drug thatcan induce a state similar to schizophrenia. When asked why he tookthe drug, Linares told officers, ``What would you do if your sonjust died?'' according to Zalas.   Linares' lawyer, Daniel Coyne, said Linares was not a drugabuser, but tried the drug ``purely (as) an experiment.'' The drughad been given to him by a friend, the lawyer said.   Doctors reported that Linares had not suffered an overdose butmerely a ``bad reaction,'' and that PCP, cocaine and alcohol werein his blood, Coyne said.   In April, Linares was charged with murder after he pulled ahandgun in a hospital where his 15-month-old son, Samuel, was beingkept, ordered staff from the room, and then unhooked the boy'slife-support system. He held the boy, who had been in a coma fornine months after choking on a balloon, until he died.   The incident sparked a widespread debate over the ethics ofkeeping comatose patients with little chance of recovery alive andthe proper role of family members and medical and legal authorities.   Prosecutors decided not to pursue the murder charge after agrand jury refused to indict Linares on May 19. Linares did pleadguilty to a misdemeanor gun violation and was sentenced to a yearof probation and psychological counseling, if deemed necessary.   Cicero police filed no charges against Linares in connectionwith Thursday's incident, but a spokesman for the state'sattorney's office said prosecutors were looking into Linares'admission that he used illegal drugs.   Assistant State's Attorney Scott Nelson said any violation oflaw would be a violation of Linares' probation.</TEXT></DOC>
