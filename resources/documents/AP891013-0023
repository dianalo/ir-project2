And President Bush today renewed his implicit invitation forrebels to overthrow Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega andrenewed the promise of U.S. help. ``I wouldn't mind using force ifit could be done in a prudent manner,'' Bush said at a newsconference. ``So I'm not ruling out the use of force for all time.''   Members of the House Intelligence Committee earlier this yearbarred the Bush administration from exercising certain unspecifiedoptions in Panama ``that might have led to a different outcome'' inthe coup, according to intelligence sources who spoke Thursday oncondition of anonymity.   ``The reason we didn't have total information (as the coupunfolded) was because of the action of some members of theIntelligence Committee,'' said one source.   There was ``interference'' and ``second-guessing'' when theadministration proposed a set of actions designed to give it betterinside knowledge of the Panamanian Defense Forces, the source said.   At his news conference, Bush said he has made no specificrequest of the Senate and House intelligence committees since thecoup for additional authority in Panama. But, he added, ``wemight'' make such a request later.   ``I think under the Constitution a president has ... broadpowers, broader than some in the Senate or the House might think...I want to work cooperatively with these committees.''   Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the senior Republican on the SenateIntelligence Committee, said policymakers need to provide betterguidelines as to when U.S. personnel can become involved in a coup,particularly when there is the possibility of assassination _something banned under current policy.   ``Does it follow from this prohibition that American personnelare confined to a purely passive role of gathering intelligence?''Cohen said in a statement.   ``Or are there circumstances in which they could provideinformation or assistance to groups seeking to overthrowdictatorial governments and establish democracies? There appears tobe confusion surrounding this question.''   On Thursday, the Bush administration denied Noriega's allegationthe United States paid $1 million to rebel officers to launch lastweek's failed coup. The administration contends U.S. officials werenotified in advance by Panamanians involved in the coup but did notplay a part in planning it.   The intelligence sources said the Bush administration notifiedCongress earlier this year of options involving Panama in anintelligence ``finding,'' a document required to be given toCongress before covert actions are undertaken.   Some of the loudest criticism of Bush's handling of the Oct. 3coup attempt against Noriega by PDF rebel officers has come frommembers of Congress, including Senate Intelligence CommitteeChairman David Boren, D-Okla.   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., withoutmentioning names, said Thursday that there is ``plenty in the(classified) record ... to know that some of these people are goingfar beyond what they've got the ight to say about theadministration's requests in the past, what was granted and whatwas denied.''   One member of the House Intelligence Committee alluded to thecongressional restrictions during debate on the appropriations billfor intelligence agencies, saying Bush's cautious response to thecoup was justified in part by interference from the DemocraticCongress.   ``Who could expect this administration or any administration, orany intelligence agencies, to make gutsy decisions when we havelashed them, put them under the whip, tethered them, told them theybetter not do anything?'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa.   Shuster noted that some on Capitol Hill have said Bush hasreceived ``everything he wanted with regard to Panama.''   ``And yet we know there are those who have gone to the WhiteHouse and threatened them with exposure (of) classifiedinformation, and said, `You dare not engage in covertoperations,''' Shuster said.   Boren said on NBC television last weekend, ``Since George Bushbecame president, every single word of authority that he hasrequested from the Intelligence Committee and every single pennythat he has requested from the Intelligence Committee relating toPanama, he has gotten and he has gotten with my support.''   Noriega told reporters for The Los Angeles Times and The BostonGlobe that Panamanian investigators discovered a bank account inthe name of Capt. Erick A. Murillo, one of the alleged coupleaders, with more than $1 million.   ``There was a lot of money there for a normal Panamanian,''Noriega was quoted as saying. ``Six zeroes. It was a million dollaraccount.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday inGulfport, Miss., ``The State Department says it's absurd, theNational Security Council says there's nothing to it and I say wedon't believe anything Noriega says.''   But the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday reported today thatthe Central Intelligence Agency played a role in planning the coup,including advising rebel officers to seize Noriega at a meetingU.S. officials were certain he would attend.   Attributing the information to unidentified congressional andadministration sources, the newspaper said the CIA's advice was amajor factor in the delay of the coup by one day.</TEXT></DOC>
