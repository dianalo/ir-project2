It is shown that an ultra low birefringence ``spun''single-mode fiber is extremely suitable for use in a magneto-optic current-meter.The properties of this fiber have been investigated. Measurements ofhigh, pulsed currents with good accuracy and in accord with theory arepresented. In order to calculate the current unambiguously and more accuratefrom the signals of the current-meter, a system with a double detectorwas constructed. Measurements of high, pulsed currents with this systemare also presented. 34 figs., 12 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
