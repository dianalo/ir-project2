Hooked to the portable tape deck next to him is a hydrophonesubmerged in a pool surrounded by ice. With astonishing claritycome the sounds of splashes, the whales' whooshing exhalations, andoccasional grinding static when the barnacle-covered skin of one ofthe whales grates against the hydrophone.   With public and media attention focused on the plight of threeCalifornia gray whales stranded in unusually early ice in theBeaufort Sea, Carroll and his colleagues at the North Slope Boroughare trying to take advantage of an almost unprecedented scientificopportunity.   ``Seldom do you get the chance to study whales in the wild undersuch ideal conditions,'' says Carroll as he logs the times thewhales surface and their rates of respiration.   The closeup and relatively long-term study of the whales isbeing made possible by their failure to leave their summer feedinggrounds promptly. For nearly two weeks, the whales have beenalternating between two small breathing holes about 75 yards apart.   The whales, one of them more than 30 feet long, haven't beeninclined to use their bulk to break through the ice. When they werefirst trapped, it was only a few inches thick. Now it is more thanone foot.   ``They could do it if they just would,'' Carroll said of theiricebreaking potential.   Larger bowhead whales, which arrive in the ice-choked ArcticOcean earlier and leave later, regularly break through several feetof ice to breath.   Outside, a few fingers of northern lights streak thestar-studded sky. A bonechilling wind persists against thefoam-insulated plywood walls of the ``sled shed,'' which wasdragged into position by a snowmobile.   The primitive structure is warmed by a small space heater tokeep the equipment from freezing.   A shotgun loaded with slugs hangs on a nearby hook. Beforestepping outside, the biologists scan the vicinity with aflashlight, looking for the telltale green eyes of a polar bear.The great white bears regularly hunt open water like this to nabunwary seals or sticken whales.   In the darkness, the sudden surfacing of a whale is startling,its warm, moist breath palpable to anyone standing along the edgeof the ice.   In the shed, the splashes and breath sounds are interrupted byoccasional moans and grunts _ vocalizations, the biologists callthem.   ``Sometimes, they'll make a noise like a drum roll, like someonebeating on a bongo drum or a steel drum,'' he said, tapping hisfingers on the workbench to illustrate.   But Carroll is surprised at how quiet the gray whales arecompared to the more loquacious bowheads.   ``It is sort of fortunate that bowheads vocalize as much as theydo, or we could never count them acoustically. If they were asquiet as these guys, it (acoustical counting) would be of no use atall.''   The bowheads are what the borough biologists are most familiarwith and interested in. The bowheads, up to 60 feet long, are thestaple of the traditional subsistence diet of the Eskimos.   When international pressure threatened to end all whaling, theborough and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission began intensivecensus studies to demonstrate there was an adequate bowheadpopulation to sustain limited subsistence whaling.   But the biologists are more than willing to study the smallergray whales, an endangered species.   ``It's interesting. It's a freak occurrence,'' says biologistCraig George. ``I'm not sure how much it's going to add to graywhale biology. And I'm not sure how much it's going to help us downthe road. But we're interested all the same.''</TEXT></DOC>
