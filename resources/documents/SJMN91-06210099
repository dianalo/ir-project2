Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., pressured the Transportation Department to fire anemployee who criticized him in a letter to North Dakota newspapers, anothercongressman says. Dorgan called the department three times about an aide toTransportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and one time &quot;actually suggested thatthat person be fired,&quot; Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., said on the House floor lastweek.;    Dorgan denied Walker's charge. But a Transportation Departmentspokeswoman said Dorgan &quot;did call several times and he did explicitly askabout the letter and the young man's employment status with us.
