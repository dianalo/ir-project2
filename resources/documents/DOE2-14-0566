Constitution: In a neutron energyregion where ratio of the volume Vc of the coolant channel to the volumeVf of the nuclear fuel material in a fuel assembly (= Vc/Vf) is lessthan 1.5 and the kinetic energy of neutrons is less than 1 electron voltburnable poisons comprising neutron absorbing nuclides having at leastone resonance energy are incorporated. In the fuel assembly with theratio Rf of less than 1.5, the reactivity worth of the burnable poisonis increased as the ratio Rf is increased (less void), whereas the poisonreactivity worth is decreased as the ratio Rf is reduced (void is great),and the reactivity change in the fuel assembly due to the change of voidcan be reduced.
