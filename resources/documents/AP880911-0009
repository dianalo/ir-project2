It isn't tieddown or anything,'' Bill Gibson, 58, said as he hauled away a12-foot-long branch that had fallen from a tree next to hisundamaged trailer house in Venice, near the mouth of theMississippi River.   One death _ that of an Alabama man who drowned Friday trying tosecure a boat against the rising winds _ was linked to the storm,which was downgraded to a tropical depression by dawn Saturday.   ``All we lost was a good night's sleep,'' said Wade Guice, civildefense director for Harrison County, Miss. ``This storm fizzledout. The hurricane didn't come.''   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the easternCaribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. TheNational Hurricane Center reported its position late Saturday nightas near latitude 16.0 north, longitude 67.3 west, about 225 milessoutheast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to be nearly 75 mph.Gilbert was expected drop 5 to 10 inches of rain on Puerto Rico andthe Dominican Republic by Sunday, the hurricane center said.   Florence hit on the 23rd anniversary of Hurricane Betsy's 1965landfall but packed little of Betsy's punch. Betsy killed more than70 people in Louisiana and did an estimated $1.1 billion in damage.   Damage estimates for Florence were unavailable but appeared tobe relatively minor.   Crews from the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness wentout Saturday to assess the damage and start cleaning up, said statepolice Trooper Paul Wood.   Sheriff's deputies said property damage appeared to be minimaland limited mainly to downed power lines that knocked outelectricity to 115,000 or more homes and businesses.   Thousands of people ordered to leave homes in nine parishesFriday returned home when Florence dropped from hurricane totropical storm. They found several broken branches and a few bentor broken signs.   ``We were expecting the worst and hoping for the best, and wegot the best out of it,'' said Larry Ciko, a spokesman for thesheriff's office in St. Tammany Parish, across Lake Pontchartrainfrom New Orleans.   A tornado was reported in neighboring Tangipahoa Parish. TheNational Weather Service said the tropical depression was pushing awide band of showers and thunderstorms into northeast Louisiana,extreme southwest Arkansas and central Mississippi.   At 5 p.m. CDT, the National Weather Service said Florence wascentered over central Louisiana, moving toward the west-northwestand weakening.   Winds unleashed by Florence never reached the 100 mph that hadbeen feared.   Bill Tregre, a spokesman for the two companies that supplyelectricity to most of south Louisiana, said the storm cut power toabout 70,000 Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co. customers and about 33,000customers of New Orleans Public Service Inc. About 6,900 remainedwithout power Saturday afternoon, but Tregre said he expected allwould have their electricity restored before Sunday.   Ciko said Central Louisiana Electric Co. officials told him that12,000 to 14,000 customers were without power at the height of thestorm.   Although the storm was expected to bring 5 to 10 inches of rain,less than 2 inches was reported around most of southeast Louisiana.   ``The fast movement of the storm kept a lid on the rains,'' saida weather service meteorologist who refused to give his name.   Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic stormseason, was the second hurricane. The first, Debby, reached minimalhurricane strength briefly before hitting Mexican coast last month.</TEXT></DOC>
