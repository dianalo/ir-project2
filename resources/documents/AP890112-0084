(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A law requiring rest breaks and specialtraining for many workers using video display terminals went intoeffect today in a Long Island county despite a legal challenge.   Suffolk County health officials, who will enforce the law,estimated that it applies to 8,500 VDT users in 150 to 200businesses.   The measure is believed to be the first VDT-regulating lawenacted by a local government.   A state Supreme Court judge is expected to rule within the nexttwo weeks on a challenge to the measure brought by four businesses.   The judge has already granted the four businesses a preliminaryinjunction blocking a section of the law that would have requiredemployers to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations andglasses for VDT operators.   Suffolk County's 18-member legislature approved the law in Juneover the objections of County Executive Patrick Halpin, who said itwould hurt businesses and was of questionable value to VDT operators.   The measure applies to operators who spend more than 26 hours aweek in front of a screen in a private workplace with 20 or moreterminals.   Beginning today, those workers must be given a 15-minute break oralternate work assignment every three hours.   The employers also must notify VDT operators of health hazards,including eye strain and nervous disorders, which may result fromprolonged use of VDTs, and must schedule training in recognizingsymptoms and taking protective steps.   The law does not include fines for violations, but healthofficials can file civil charges to force compliance.</TEXT></DOC>
