It was quickly realized that this was not the best solutionto the problem. Simply stated, the problem is not an actual fire in thecarbon, but a temperature rise that could result in desorption of adsorbediodine, and removal of the impregnant. It was acknowledged that you couldnot put enough iodine on the carbon in most filter systems so that theiodine on the carbon could ignite the carbon. Consequently, Revisions1 and 2 to Regulatory Guide 1.52 were issued and recognized this changein emphasis. Water sprays were no longer recommended, but a low flowair bleed system would suffice, with a flow at least 10% of design flowto dissipate any decay heat. This, however, is only the position of thegovernment nuclear regulatory experts, and may not agree with the positionof the nuclear insurers. In addition, it is now recognized that wettingof the carbon can lead to structural concerns with the carbon supportstructure. The stainless steel is subject to corrosion from the iodidepresent on the carbon as impregnant, and it is imperative that once carbonbecomes wet for whatever reason, it be removed from the beds as soonas possible so that corrosion does not occur.</TEXT></DOC>
