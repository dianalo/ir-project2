The purchase was expected.    Wardair, which is based in Edmonton, Alberta, said deliveries are to start in November 1987 and be completed by December 1988.    Wardair said it will finance the purchase partly by selling seven planes from its existing fleet and partly by a public offering of its shares later this year. The A310s, which will have seating for 196 on Wardair routes, are powered by engines built by General Electric Co. at Schenectady, N.Y. Airbus is based in Toulouse, France. </TEXT></DOC>
