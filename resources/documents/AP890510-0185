Fixed-rate mortgages in early April rose 0.21 percentage pointfrom the previous month to 11.58 percent and adjustable-ratemortgages rose 0.37 point to 10.14 percent, the Federal Home LoanBank Board reported.   Those were the highest levels since December 1985, whenfixed-rate mortgages averaged 12.01 percent and adjustable-ratehome loans averaged 10.39 percent. Rates also had risen strongly inMarch.   ``The sharp two-month increase in ARM rates followed increasesin short-term market interest rates, reflecting Federal Reserveefforts to restrain inflation,'' said James Barth, chief economistfor the bank board.   The Federal Reserve for a year has been pushing up interestrates in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by restrainingeconomic growth.   The housing industry, among the sectors of the economy hardesthit by rising interest rates, has registered sharp declines inbuilding permits, construction and sales in recent months.   Despite the rise in ARM rates, the percentage of mortgagesclosed with adjustable rates rose to 56 percent in early April, upslightly from 55 percent in the previous month.   A separate weekly report released Friday by the Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, showed interest ratesremained relatively high throughout April and into the start of May.   Fixed-rate mortgages were averaging 10.97 percent last week,down slightly from 11.03 percent during the previous week. Onone-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an averageinitial rate of 9.36 percent last week, down from 9.38 percent theweek before, Freddie Mac said.   The Freddie Mac figures are lower than those reported by thebank board because they do not include add-on fees, known aspoints, which are paid by borrowers.</TEXT></DOC>
