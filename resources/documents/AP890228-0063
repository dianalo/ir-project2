By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr. forfeitedthe right to challenge his sentence in federal court on an issue hehad failed to raise in state appellate courts.   Adams was convicted of strangling 8-year-old Trisa Gail Thornleyin Ocala 11 years ago.   His conviction and death sentence were upheld three times by theFlorida Supreme Court before being overturned by a federal appealscourt.   Adams sought federal court review of his case in early 1986,arguing for the first time that the trial judge's instructionsmisled jurors about their role in determining what punishment Adamsshould receive.   Under Florida law, a jury recommends life or death for convictedmurderers in capital cases. The presiding judge is free to follow ordisregard the recommendation.   The judge in Adams' case told jurors about that aspect of thestate's capital-sentencing law, adding, ``The final decision as towhat punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of thiscourt.''   Adams argued successfully before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals that the judge's instructions ran afoul of a 1985 SupremeCourt decision in which the justices said a death sentence isinvalid if a jury is misled about its role in determining whetherthe defendant actuall will die.   In the 1985 decision, the justices reversed a Mississippimurderer's death sentence because a prosecutor told jurors theirdecision would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court.   Writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White said the 11thCircuit court never should have reached the merits of Adams' appeal.   White said Adams' failure to raise the jury-instruction issue inhis state court appeals precluded him from raising it in a so-calledhabeas corpus appeal in federal court.   ``The ground for challenging the trial judge's instructions _that they were objectionable under state law _ was a necessaryelement of the subsequently available claim'' arising from the 1985decision in the Mississippi case, White said.   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshalland John Paul Stevens dissented.   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.</TEXT></DOC>
