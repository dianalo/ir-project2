 Many parentsconsider a computer an important college expense, although somegive their children 'hand me down' machines.andP;  IBM, Apple, andother major manufacturers sell equipment to students at largediscounts, and many software vendors offer low-priced 'student'editions of popular packages.andP;  Laptops are popular with studentsbecause desk space in most schools is cramped.andP;  Campus computinghas caused problems with software piracy, plagiarism, and otherabuses but generally tends to encourage honesty by making workeasier.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Information Storage and RetrievalOn-Line SearchingMicrocomputersColleges and UniversitiesStudent.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Not long ago, computers on campus meant time-shared mainframes used bybudding scientists, engineers, and programmers-nerds, some would say.andP;  Buttoday, powerful desktop machines are making computing a fact of life forstudents in almost every field.andM;Professors have incorporated computers into the academic regimen.andP;  Undergradshand in wordprocessed papers.andP;  From dormitories wired into voice/datanetworks, students with PCs send e-mail, dial in to the library, drop offassignments, and access mainframe information, all from the same phone linethey use to call home for money.andP;  So it's not surprising that 40 percent ofcollege students surveyed by Roper Campus Reports, of New York City, declaredcomputers &quot;essential&quot; to their lifestyle.andM;Roughly one college student in five owns a computer, according toCollegeTrack, a market research firm in New York City.andP;  For those who don't,many universities provide convenient computer centers.andP;  At Harvard and MIT,students can buy time on a laser printer/word processing rig by the hour.andM;Still, such facilities are strained, especially during exams.andP;  WashingtonUniversity sophomore Stephanie Rappaport recalls interminable waits forcomputing time at the St.andP;  Louis school.andP;  &quot;I got used to working at 2 a.m.andO;because it was the best time to get on a machine.&quot;andM;Thus the incentive for students to bring their own computers.andP;  &quot;We've beengetting more and more call-s ftom anxious parents wondering what computerstheir children should bring,&quot; says MIT's Gary Welsh, whose duties includehelping faculty and students assess their computing needs.andP;  At CarnegieMellon, 15 percent of first-year students have their own computers, andanother 30 percent plan to buy one during the year.andP;  A Shopper's ParadiseandM;Many parents calculate the cost of a computer as an integral part of collegeexpenses.andP;  &quot;My son has used our computer at home throughout high school,&quot;says Joel Goldfine of New York City, who upgraded his son's machine from anApple IIGS to a Mac SE to meet the demands of higher education.andP;  &quot;He couldn'tdo his work without a word processor.&quot; More typically, parents send theirkids off to school with hand-medowns such as a vintage 8088 PC or a Commodore64, while keeping the ATs and Macintoshes home.andM;Before buying a new computer, parents should find out whether campusdiscounts are available at the student's school.andP;  Big-name manufacturers likeApple, IBM, Zenith, Toshiba, and Hewlett-Packard, viewing academia as fertileground for cultivating lifelong users, lop 40 to 50 percent off the price ofequipment sold to holders of student IDs.andP;  Though inexpensive clones may befound on campus, name-brand discounts are so good that clones are less of abargain there than elsewhere.andM;Similarly, software vendors sell cut-rate student editions of popularprograms.andP;  At Texas Tech, in Lubbock, Texas, for example, Microsoft Word'sAcademic Edition sells for $93.15, and Microsoft Works Academic Edition costs$55.17.andP;  Some academic versions of software programs lack key features of thefullfleged versions, however.andM;Both IBM and Apple aggressively pursue the higher education market.andP;  IBMoffers several ready-to-use academic configurations, with software installed.andO;IBM's discount computers are available in 1,500 of the country's 3,400colleges and universities, according to Ken Lilienfeld, IBM's manager ofstudent and desktop marketing.andP;  And those, he says, tend to be the largerschools, accounting for more than half the students in the country.andM;Apple has an equally vigorous educational policy., The company sells directlyto 600 schools, each of which determines its own pricing and gets discountsbased on volume purchases.andM;But Apples and IBMs don't monopolize the campus computing scene.andP;  BentleyCollege, a business school near Boston, issues its students HP Vectras.andP;  AtDrew University, in Madison, New Jersey, one of the few liberal arts collegesto require computers, every first-year student receives a Zenith laptop withWordPerfect, Enable, and a printer.andP;  The cost-about $1,500-is built into thetuition.andM;Although few schools dictate which type of computer students should use, a defacto standard usually arises.andP;  Dartmouth, for example, is a Mac school;Amherst is a PC school.andP;  Students with incompatible systems will find fewerpeople on campus with whom they can swap software easily.andM;The Laptop FraternityandM;Cramped desk space makes Laptop and portable computers especially attractiveto students.andP;  &quot;You can take them back to the dorm, to the library, or towrite poetry under a tree,&quot; suggests Wallace J.andP;  Gowney, chairman of themanagement and mathematical science departments at Susquehanna University, inSelinsgrove, Pennsylvania.andM;Portability is expensive.andP;  Laptops generally cost $2,500 to $3,500, as muchas $1,000 more than desktop machines with the same capability.andP;  However,Laptops for simple word processing are available for as little as $600.andM;Laptops have the strongest presence in schools where computers are part ofthe curriculum.andP;  Harvard's business school now issues students ZenithSupersPorts and Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Instructors at Drew University often tellstudents to bring their Laptops to class.andP;  Peripheral IssuesandM;The cost of outfitting the college computer user climbs as you add a monitor,printer, modem, and other accoutrements.andP;  Fortunately, a student doesn't needeverything a professional does.andP;  Color monitors, for example, are unnecessaryfor most schoolwork; most students who upgrade from monochrome do so toenrich game play, not scholarship.andP;  Ultimately, students may want modems, butit's wise to wait; many dorms are wired for direct -connections to the campusnetwork.andP;  (For more information about the commercial networks they canaccess, see &quot;The Services and What They Offer&quot;.andM;Printers are another unessential extra.andP;  Adequate on-campus and commercialprinter facilities are available at most large universities.andP;  Even thoughlaser output has become standard for paper submissions, reports MIT's GaryWelsh, few students bring laser printers to campus.andP;  Students are quick toestablish informal equipment-sharing networks, making the kid with the lasera big man on campus.andM;Electronic MischiefandM;Not surprisingly, college computing has its share of mischief Softwarepiracy, for example, is rampant.andP;  &quot;I don't know anyone who buys their owncopy of a program,&quot; says Sean Voght, a Berkeley senior&quot;You get it from afriend and buy a book to learn how to use it.&quot;andM;High tech also makes plagiarism all too easy.andP;  Sales of handheld scannershave been mounting recently, according to Hal Meyer of The Computer Source inNew York City, which sells direct to many schools, including Barnard,Columbia, and New York University.andP;  Some students are reportedly using thedevices to scan typewritten notes or even papers into their PCs.andP;  Altering ascanned document to make it a passable paper is a lot less work than honestlyresearching a topic and writing an original paper.andM;The prospect of such abuses might sour some parents on the idea of packing aPC in their college kid's trunk.andP;  But look at it another way: with a computerto accelerate their schoolwork, students can better handle the rigors ofacademe, without succumbing to pressure and doing something stupid.andM;The Well-Connected StudentandM;Armed with a computer, a modem, software, and access to online services,students can tune in to an electronic community that transcends local cultureand gives them access to galaxies of information.andM;In schools across the country, students are going online with the world.andO;Using services such as CompuServe, Prodigy, and PC-Link, they chat with adultprofessionals, adopt foreign pen pals, and gather information.andP;  TheConnecticut Science Museum uses online services to perk up inner-city kids'interest in technology.andP;  When some of these students went looking forelectronic pen pals online, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak was a willingcorrespondent.andP;  Looking It UpandM;The online edition of Grolier's Academic American Encyclopedia is availableon most services and has become the cornerstone of many students' onlineexperience.andP;  Key in a search word, and the program retrieves all matchingentries.andM;Most online vendors also offer a gateway service, such as I Quest or EasyNet.andO;A gateway is an information retrieval umbrella that searches a number ofdifferent databases for answers to queries.andP;  Kids can tap into a specificdatabase through the gateway, or they can enter a query on a given subjectand navigate through the gateway's menu choices to channel the search to theappropriate database.andM;Other online stomping grounds include Peterson's College Guide, available onCompuServe, and Consumer Reports, which can be accessed through a number ofservices.andP;  Be warned, however, that information retrieval usually requires apayment in addition to the basic service charges.andM;The PC VillageandM;Online talk sessions allow students to enter the kind of global village thatfuturists rhapsodize about.andP;  Kids may quickly encounter kindred spiritsthrough special interest groups devoted to photography, astronomy, scubadiving, tropical fish, and a multitude of other subjects.andM;I've read the online dialogues of younger kids as they've fleshed out schoolassignments, argued about rock and roll, swapped kid's-eye views of recentnews events, and helped one another cope with social problems.andP;  Prodigy'sUnder 21 Club exists exclusively for this purpose; other online services payhomage to the idea with students' forums.andM;Since age, looks, and other physical criteria aren't relevant in the onlineworld, kids often speak to adults without the usual barriers.andP;  Classrooms ofkids on CompuServe meet regularly with professionals for online discussions.andO;Space enthusiasts on GEnie chat with NASA staff and with adult aerospacebuffs.andP;  PC-Link's Learning Center offers homework help from teachers.andP;  Andone bulletin board encourages students to post puzzling academic problemsthat they want help with.andM;Current EventsandM;Students once used clippings from periodicals to fuel discussions incurrent-events classes.andP;  Today's kids can keep up-to-date electronically.andO;National, international, sports, weather, and financial developments aretransmitted in a timely manner from all of the commercial services.andO;Prodigy's Under 21 Club even selects news items of special interest tostudents.andM;Prodigy also offers online versions of National Geographic and, for theyounger crowd, My Weekly Reader.andP;  Not only do students get to read thestories from these publications, they can engage in computer conversationswith the editors.andP;  Other commercial services sponsor their own onlinemagazines-CompuServe's Online Today, for example, and GEnie's LiveWIRE.andP;  PCMagazine also has an online forum.andM;Like any good children's medium, online services provide a healthy dollop ofentertainment through book, movie, and video reviews; horoscopes; artgalleries- and joke swapping.andP;  Trivia and whiz-kid contests abound.andP;  And theonline world is a gamer's paradise, with shoot-'em-ups, adventure chronicles,solo activities, and interactive sessions with players from around thecountry.andP;  Some games let you try your skill against the computer- others aremeant to be downloaded to the PC and played offline.andM;Online services, still groping for a utilitarian place in the world, remaincostly, difficult to navigate, and rife with not-very-useful information.andO;But with them, young, information-seeking pioneers improve their chances ofthriving in the information age.andM;The Services and What They OfferandM;Here are the online services with ofandM;ferings most likely to interest kids.andP;  Coverage overlaps; several services,for example, offer Grolier's Encyclopedia.andP;  Still, each service has adistinctive flavor, ranging from Delphi's internationalism to Prodigy'scommercialism.andP;  Local Bulletin BoardsandM;Kids can tap into more than 14,000 local BBSs (bulletin board systems) acrossthe country for the cost of a phone call.andP;  BBSs act as electronic wateringholes for online conversation, serve up downloadable software, and provideforums for special interests.andP;  Parents may want to keep an eye on thebulletin boards that their children call; more than a few BBSs are X-rated.andM;Some bulletin boards are fly-bynight systems; the best way to find out aboutcurrent local BBS services is through users' group in your area.andP;  Usually, ifyou find one number, others will be posted on that bulletin board.andM;CompuServeandM;As the largest and most diverse online service, CompuServe boasts 500,000members in 100 countries.andP;  Kids can choose from 45 game groups and join aforum for students or special interest forums on space and astronomy, scienceand math, and other topics.andP;  They can tap Grolier's online encyclopedia,various news services, and Peterson's College Database.andP;  Other information isavailable via the IQuest gateway service.andP;  An advanced electronic mailservice includes conferencing and a link to MCI Mail.andP;  Membership: $39.95initiation fee plus $1.50 monthly fee.andP;  Usage fee.andP;  $6 to $12.50/hour, pluscommunications surcharges.andP;  CompuServe, Inc., 5000 Arlington Centre Blvd.,andO;P.O.andP;  Box 20212, Columbus, Ohio 43220; 800848-8199, 614-457-0802.andM;DelphiandM;Delphi combines electronic mail, special interest groups, and informationretrieval services such as Grolier's encyclopedia and a gateway service toDialog, the largest collection of online information.andP;  Country and cityprofiles, hobby shops, computer clubs, and an AIDS information network areprovided as well.andP;  Delphi has an international flair: you can send a messagein English and have it translated to another language for overseasrecipients.andP;  And it has spawned some interesting regional services.andP;  Delphi/Boston, for example, provides forums to accompany programming by public TVstation WGBH.andP;  Membership: $49.95 ($29.95 membership for Delphi/Boston).andO;Usage fee: $4.80 to $17.40/hour (lower rates for higher usage).andP;
