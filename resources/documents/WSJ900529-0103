But today that consensus isunder unprecedented pressure. There have been too manyreported racial &quot;incidents&quot; on U.S. campuses, neighborhoodagitators now boycott Asian grocery stores, and raciallymotivated taunts, beatings and even shootings are on therise.   Amid this, President Bush is told by the most familiarcivil-rights organizations that if he vetoes the proposedCivil Rights Act of 1990 it &quot;would unleash a firestorm ofprotest.&quot; The NAACP's Ben Hooks says the bill is a &quot;litmustest&quot; of President Bush's support for blacks. Perhaps thisissue no longer holds the simple clarity that Mr. Hooks sees.</LP><TEXT>   In practice, it is very likely that this bill wouldexacerbate race relations. That is because the bill is rootedin the paradoxical notion that the way to lessen racialtensions is to encourage many lawsuits. How could anyonetruly believe such a thing?   Litigation by its nature is bitter and divisive. Lawsuitsexaggerate differences, forcing people to take extreme sidesin the hothouse atmosphere of courtrooms. President Bush saidrecently that it would be a mistake to sign a bill that is&quot;some lawyers' bonanza, encouraging litigation at the expenseof conciliation, mediation or settlement.&quot; He is right.   The litigation this bill has in mind is different from theimportant and necessary court opinions of the 1960s thatensured desegregation, voting rights and equal opportunity.Instead, the current bill will use litigation to effectivelymandate quotas.   Its sponsors are too politically sensitive to use the word&quot;quota,&quot; but the bill's mechanics would drive the systemtoward that end. Setting aside due process, it creates apresumption of an employer's guilt. An employer who is suedwill be guilty of &quot;discrimination&quot; unless he can explain theexistence of any &quot;disparate impact&quot; in hiring by race andsex. The explanation must prove that employment practicessuch as requirements and tests must have what the currentcompromise language calls a &quot;substantial and demonstrablerelationship to effective job performance.&quot; No one knows whatthis means.   Civil Rights Commission Chairman Arthur Fletcher assuresthat the result will be &quot;goals&quot; and not &quot;quotas.&quot; We have 20years of Supreme Court cases describing how goals becameunconstitutional quotas. This was true even without theinnovations of this bill -- such as that there should be jurytrials with punitive damages. It hardly seems prudent to setoff an explosion of litigation by contingency-fee lawyers nowto test the bill's vague wording.   Without meaning to be at all frivolous about the bill'sleast desirable effects, it would not be too much to call itthe Alton Maddox Bill. Mr. Maddox is the black New York Citylawyer who, with the Rev. Al Sharpton, was at the center ofthe racially inflammatory Tawana Brawley case. This pastweek, attorney Maddox and his associate C. Vernon Mason, alsoa lawyer, were making further contributions to New York'scurrent anguish over race relations.   Speaking of Mayor David Dinkins's attempts to heal thecity, Mr. Maddox said, &quot;Any black man who advocates racialharmony is out of his mind.&quot; Mr. Mason likened Mr. Dinkins toformer South African President P.W. Botha. (It is one ofhistory's ironies that this Maddox shares the same surnamewith the famous racial inflamer of the 1960s, GeorgiaGovernor Lester Maddox.)   Is there any reason to believe that Messrs. Maddox andMason would not use the bill's irreparably flawed provisionsto drive the flames higher? It is not enough for proponentsto simply wave away this concern, because attorneys Maddoxand Mason, and others like them, are obviously manipulatingthe current system to unwind much of the racial tolerancethat is one of the civil-rights movement's greatestachievements.   (And why, we wish someone would ask them, does Congressplan to exempt itself from the bill's coverage?)   Perhaps it's time to consider that civil rights today hasmore pressing needs than endless litigation and debate overgoals vs. quotas. Civil rights now ought to be about riddingpoor neighborhoods of crime and crack, keeping familiesintact, and improving schools. Any serious civil-rights billwould abolish -- as this one does not -- the employersanctions in the immigration bill, which force employers todiscriminate against Hispanics who are here legally just toavoid possible criminal liability.   We suspect that one reason President Bush's popularityamong blacks is so high is that everyone can sense that hehas genuine good will and concern for minorities. Indeed, wethink most Americans feel this way. The bill's supportersought to bear some burden for explaining why its obviousincentives to litigate will not cause further bitterness anddivisiveness, while the real problems that beset the poorestblack Americans fester on.</TEXT></DOC>
