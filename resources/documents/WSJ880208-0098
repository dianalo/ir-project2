In a speech opening a session of parliament, President P.W. Botha devoted only a few sentences to the country's unsettled political situation, saying the government would continue with previously announced initiatives. The centerpiece of these policies, the establishment of a multiracial council to advise on constitutional changes, has been rejected by most black leaders. They refuse to participate unless the state of emergency is lifted and all political prisoners are freed.    Instead, Mr. Botha unveiled a package of economic reforms aimed primarily at white voters in a year of nationwide municipal elections. The most ambitious is the planned privatization of various state-owned monopolies in the transportation, post and utilities sectors. Mr. Botha didn't give many specifics of which government assets would be sold, or when, but he said proceeds would be used to pay off foreign debt and modernize the country's underdeveloped regions.    However, Mr. Botha risked upsetting some of his constituency by announcing plans to hold down increases on civil-service salaries, which eat up almost one-third of state spending. He also pledged to reduce inflation, which has run between 15% and 20% annually in recent years, outpacing pay raises for blue-collar white workers and touching off a backlash against the government.    Although the economic moves were generally praised by the white business sector, which has long advocated privatization, the country's major unions, both black and white, lashed out at efforts to hold the line on wages.    The new emphasis on the economy was also assailed by the government's political opponents, who say the country's central dilemma of sharing political power with the black majority is being ignored. South Africa's 24 million blacks aren't represented anywhere in the central government, which is controlled by the five million whites.    &quot;There is no commitment to get rid of apartheid and discrimination, no vision of the future,&quot; said Colin Eglin, leader of the Progressive Federal Party, the main liberal opposition in the white parliament. &quot;There is no indication of any determination to grapple with the fundamental issues that are the root cause of our problems.&quot;    Government officials say economic prosperity is a prerequisite of political reform. Only in recent months has the economy begun to pull out of a recession that was aggravated by international economic sanctions and corporate disinvestment. &quot;In order to reform, one needs a sound economy,&quot; said Stoffel van der Merwe, the deputy minister of information and of constitutional planning. &quot;Reform costs money.&quot;    Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said he couldn't predict when the economic measures might start paying off. &quot;In Africa, if you want to measure progress you don't need a watch,&quot; he said. &quot;You need a calendar.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
