The project has managed to keep within time and costrequirements. The first phase has been completed; the second phase, involvingthe installation of a GEC gas turbine currently under construction inLincoln, is now in jeopardy. An alternative scheme involving a toppingcycle, which adds a spouted bed gasifier to the PFBC cycle, is proposed,and British Coal is lobbying the UK Department of Energy for fundingfor it. Privatisation of the electricity industry may well increase thedemand for smaller power generating units; PFBC shows definite economicadvantages over plants using pulverized fuels and flue gas desulfurization.</TEXT></DOC>
