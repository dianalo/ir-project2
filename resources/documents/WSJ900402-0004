The AHA is expected to announce today or tomorrow that itis discontinuing the seal because of objections from the Foodand Drug Administration. AHA officials wouldn't confirm themove, but Scott Ballin, vice president of public affairs,conceded that &quot;the FDA has problems with the seal, and withthird-party endorsements of food products by us or anyone.The next question is, based on those facts, where do we gofrom here?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   AHA officials met throughout the weekend to discuss theiroptions. Industry executives believe the group, while doingaway with the seal itself, will refocus on other parts of theseal program, known as HeartGuide. Among the alternativesthey are considering are education efforts and working withthe FDA either on a different labeling program or to refinethe regulatory agency's own proposed food labelingregulations.   The seal-of-approval concept has been troubled from thestart. The AHA developed the program to identify foods itdeemed low in cholesterol, sodium and fats. Brands thatpassed muster -- and paid a fee -- could display the AHAHeartGuide logo on their labels and in advertising. The AHAhad grand visions of making the seal the equivalent of theGood Housekeeping seal, and encouraged products that bore itto trumpet the fact in ads. When the seal was introduced inearly February, several brands, including Mazola and Promisemargarines and Pam non-stick spray, were planning majormarketing campaigns around it.   But the program immediately raised the ire of the FDA,which promptly threatened regulatory action. In a warningletter sent in February, James S. Benson, acting commissionerof the FDA, told the AHA that its program would &quot;increaseconsumer confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution tothe food-labeling problem.&quot; For example, the FDA wasconcerned that the HeartGuide seal on margarine and oilswould lead consumers to believe that these were health foods.Friday, the FDA repeated its objections to third-partyendorsements in another letter to the AHA.   The FDA's complaints prompted most of the 103 brands inthe initial launch of HeartGuide to back out before theprogram even started; among the defectors were Mazola, Pam,Promise and Candamp;W Frozen Foods. But several dozen remained,with some going through the expense of redesigning theirpackaging to show off the seal. They will now have to removethe seal, if they haven't already.   The HeartGuide seal's demise comes as the FDA isconsidering its own health-claim labeling regulations,perhaps with input from the AHA. The FDA earlier this yearproposed tough new labeling restrictions that would crackdown on many claims, and probably would discourage many ofthe labeling claims made today. But consumer activist groupshave criticized the FDA for dragging its feet on healthclaims.   &quot;I'm concerned that the FDA won't go far enough or actquickly enough,&quot; says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutritionfor the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumeractivist group. &quot;The demise of this program means we need toput more pressure on the FDA. It provides one more reason topush for legislation that would force the FDA to overhaulfood labels.&quot; Two bills pending on Capitol Hill would requirethe FDA to define terms like &quot;light&quot; and &quot;low fat.&quot;   The FDA declined to comment. It may have been concernedbecause other health groups were considering their own stampsof approval for foods, which could have led to consumerconfusion.   Still, says Ms. Liebman, the demise of the HeartGuide seal&quot;is a shame for consumers who want simple thumbs up or thumbsdown advice on whether a food is good for their heart. Thiskind of labeling is something the FDA should have been doinga long time ago.&quot;   ---   Campbell Soup Accounts                                                                                                          Campbell Soup announced a long-expected consolidation ofits ad agency lineup, cutting out three agencies whilespreading the bulk of its $150 million account more equallyamong four others.   In the reorganization, Campbell cuts out DDB Needham, HalRiney andamp; Partners and Saatchi andamp; Saatchi/London, each of whichhad relatively small pieces of Campbell business. BBDO andFCB/Leber Katz Partners are the biggest beneficiaries of theconsolidation, picking up most of that business and puttingthem closer in league to Backer Spielvogel Bates, which hadbeen Campbell's largest agency.   Backer Spielvogel, which had an estimated $35 million inCampbell business, wasn't affected by the agency shake-up,but now faces formidable competition from its fellow Campbellagencies. BBDO's billings now rival Backer Spielvogel's.Industry executives say FCB/Leber Katz's billings areslightly less than that, as are those of Ogilvy andamp; Mather,another major shop that retained all of its business exceptfor a small Swanson account.   Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., said it made the shiftsbecause of its planned agency incentive program, in whichcompensation will be tied to sales performance. Campbell saidit plans to tell its agencies details of the plan &quot;in a fewweeks.&quot; The program is to go into effect August 1.   BBDO, like DDB Needham an Omnicom Group agency, picks upSwanson frozen foods, which had been handled by both Rineyand Ogilvy andamp; Mather. BBDO also won Mrs. Paul's Kitchensfrozen food, an assignment previously handled at DDB Needham.BBDO will continue to handle Campbell's Chunky soups andCampbell's Home Cookin' soups.   FCB/Leber Katz, a unit of Foote, Cone andamp; Belding thatcurrently handles the Prego spaghetti sauce account, picks upthe Souper Combo account, which had been handled at BBDO. Theagency was also named to handle the V8 juice business, whichhad been at Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, London.   Ogilvy andamp; Mather, a unit of WPP Group, will continue tohandle a number of brands, including Le Menu dinners andPepperidge Farm products. Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchiandamp; Saatchi agency, will retain Campbell's condensed soups andCampbell's Special Request line of soups.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
