Assuming that this phased-array radar is truly a violation of the letter and the spirit of the ABM Treaty, why not get rid of it by negotiating it away? I feel sure the Soviets would gladly give up this inadequate, poorly constructed and highly vulnerable radar installation plus a few other questionable installations, if any, if we'd agree to uphold the original intent of the ABM Treaty and forget the reinterpretation concept.    We'd be doing ourselves a real favor by saving all that money and research manhours on a weapons system that threatens our adversary, making it more likely that the Soviets would overbuild offensive weapons to overwhelm any potential defense. There is no possible way to test such a system even if it were strategically valuable, which the Pentagon has questioned and the Office of Technology Assessment appraised as virtually useless.
