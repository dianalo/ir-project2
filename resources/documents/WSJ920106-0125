Having followed thattrend since 1987, I can say that it is even more serious thanthe article suggests.   While any newcomers are unwelcome in some areas, the mostpointed and successful attacks appear to be aimed at minorityreligions: It was a mosque -- the San Fernando Valley's first-- that Grenada Hills, Calif., slapped with the highestnumber of restrictions ever imposed on a house of worship;the 44 restrictions included not only a ban on domes andminarets but also a restriction on the number of membersallowed. In the two highest federal rulings on the subject,both at the appellate level, the losing plaintiffs wereJehovah's Witnesses and Hassidic Jews ( Lakewood, Ohio,Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses v. City of Lakewood,which held that cities can ban churches from residentialneighborhoods, and Gross v. City of Miami Beach, which heldthat home services can be defined as a &quot;church&quot; and thereforebanned). And in early 1989, the New York Times reported thattwo Orthodox rabbis had been slapped with $50,000 in finesfor the crime of holding minyans in their Wesley Hills, N.Y.,home.</LP><TEXT>   This serious trend, which attacks the religious freedomthat many Americans consider the very foundation ofindividual liberty, illustrates a simple point. Contrary tothe recent protestations of the Senate Judiciary Committee,Republicans and Democrats alike, property rights are notcontrary to individual rights. They are inseparable.   Virginia I. Postrel   Editor   Reason Los Angeles   ---   Your article on opposition to churches at first surprisedme tremendously. After a decade of the Reagan Right, I wouldhave thought that we weren't building churches fast enough.   Then I realized something: God, I'm just not with thetimes] If you're going to evangelize, you might as welltarget the heart of the potential flock.   And so it is my advice to the clergy to convert likewise.Specifically, you could draw the flock to your favor with thefollowing verses:   &quot;Blessed are the worldly selfish who emulate shopping-malladvertising as fact; they shall cease giving a damn and enjoyit.&quot;   &quot;Blessed are the suburban perfect, who never suffer or cryand who detest those with faults; they will prosper injudgmental apathy.&quot;   &quot;Blessed, too, are they who blame their child's coach,teacher and everybody else when truth is terribly close;their attorneys will inherit punitive damages.&quot;   &quot;Blessed are you ministers when you bury a resurrected godso that it can be recreated in the heathen's image andlikeness. Amidst convenience stores and hydromulch yards,your harvest will be proportionally great indeed.&quot;   Rich Agnello   Raleigh, N.C.</TEXT></DOC>
