The useof non-azeotropic mixture increases efficiency and more generally tooptimize fluid properties and conditions of utilization. Results of testswith ebullition and condensation of refrigerant R22 and R114 and alsowith the non-azeotropic boiling mixture R13/R22 are reported. Heat transferand pressure drop are studied.</TEXT></DOC>
