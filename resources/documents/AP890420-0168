Thousands of students hurling rocks and firebombs staged violentprotests in Seoul and three other cities to demand the ouster ofPresident Roh Tae-woo.   In Seoul, isolated clashes erupted outside four universities _Dongkuk, Korea, Dangkuk and Joong-ang _ after riot police blocked2,500 demonstrators from marching out of their schools.   Kim told a news conference he was concerned that rightists inthe government and security forces were pressuring President RohTae-woo to take a tough line against opposition groups.   ``I solemnly warn that President Roh will not be able to avoid abig misfortune, not only for the people but also for himself, if hecontinues to push only suppression,'' said Kim, leader of the Partyfor Peace and Democracy.   He urged workers and students not to stage violent protests,saying violence alienated public opinion and gave governmenthardliners an opportunity to clamp down.   The government has expressed concern that a wave of laborstrikes and student protests could seriously disrupt the economyand create political unrest. Roh has warned the government willsuppress groups that stage violent protests.   But the government said Thursday it would not block peacefulprotests, and the Cabinet issued instructions allowing orderlyanti-government demonstrations in designated areas in Seoul andother major cities.   The regulations oblige protesters to obtain police permissionfor their plans, including slogans that would be shouted at theprotests.   Thousands of anti-government students clashed with riot policein Seoul and nine other cities Wednesday to push for Roh'sdownfall. Police said Thursday that 455 protesters had beenarrested and 344 protesters and police officers were hurt.   Radical students and dissidents frequently stage violentanti-government protests, but they lack popular support because oftheir violent tactics and extremist views.   In another development Thursday, national security agentsdetained two senior journalists in connection with theirnewspaper's alleged plan to send reporters to communist North Koreawithout government approval.   Managing editor Chang Yoon-hwan and development executive ChungTae-gee of the opposition Hankyoreh Shinmun were placed in thecustody of the Agency for National Security Planning, the maingovernment intelligence organization.   Government officials said the two journalists would bequestioned on their alleged role in the newspaper's plan to sendreporters to cover North Korea in May or June.   The newspaper said the plan had been considered but never wasformally decided on. All South Koreans must get prior governmentapproval for a visit to North Korea.   The government investigators have 24 hours to decide whether tofile formal charges.</TEXT></DOC>
