Since October, corporate staff cuts have been announced atthe pace of 2,600 a day, &quot;the highest level we've ever seen,&quot;according to Dan Lacey, editor of Workplace Trendsnewsletter. &quot;Even I am astounded by that number,&quot; he says.The growing list includes companies once thought to be thevery cream of American industry.</LP><TEXT>   Just yesterday, TRW Inc. said it plans a restructuringthat, over the next year-and-a-half, will cut its work forceby 10,000 people, or 14%. Xerox Corp. said it would reducethe work force in its document-processing division by 2,500by mid-1992. And General Motors Corp. announced a &quot;majoraction&quot; that company officials said will mean theacceleration of previously announced plans to cut more than20,000 white-collar jobs in North America by 1993.   The job cutbacks yesterday are just the latest in arelentless stream. A few weeks ago, International BusinessMachines Corp. said it will cut its work force by 20,000 jobsnext year. Chairman John F. Akers said this week he willre-evaluate the situation in midyear if IBM's results haven'timproved. He said IBM might even consider layoffs, breakingwith its no-layoff tradition.   Moreover, as layoff announcements mount, fear ofunemployment is taking its toll on the American psyche. A newWall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 48% of voterscite joblessness as the top economic issue facing thecountry, up from 39% in October and only 16% in the samemonth last year. Those fears of unemployment are, in turn,leading people to cut back their spending, promptingcontinued economic weakness and further job cuts. &quot;This couldall feed on itself,&quot; worries Norman Robertson, chiefeconomist at Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh.   The main reason cited for recent corporate cutbacks is theeconomy's persistent weakness. &quot;This economy is recovering ata rate much slower than everybody thought, and the pressureon profits is much greater than everybody thought,&quot; saysMitchell Fromstein, chief executive of Manpower Inc., atemporary-help company. &quot;So companies have to go to thebiggest expense they have: wages.&quot;   With economists predicting little if any economic growthfor the next several months, the headline-makingannouncements of payroll cuts are likely to keep coming. TheConference Board's panel of human-resources executives, forinstance, recently predicted a slow recovery next year thatwill &quot;stifle&quot; job growth.   But beneath the economic logic, some analysts also see anew ethic among American businesses. A decade ago, companiessuch as IBM touted Japanese-style lifetime employmentpolicies as a model for employee relations. But as recentexperience shows, companies now seem more eager than ever toshed employees.   Indeed, IBM's own staff reductions seem to have clearedthe way for other companies. &quot;IBM in the human-resource fieldis seen as an industry leader,&quot; says Richard Belous, aneconomist with the National Planning Association. &quot;If IBM isdoing it, then it becomes within employer ranks much moresocially acceptable.&quot;   There has been &quot;a real shift in the mood of the businesscommunity,&quot; agrees Thomas Kochan, labor economist with theMassachusetts Institute of Technology. No longer are chiefexecutives praised for creating a cooperative corporateculture. Instead, &quot;the latest fad is: he's got to come in andclean house and cut heads and restructure with a vengeance,&quot;Mr. Kochan says.   Gordon B. Pye, former chief economist for Irving TrustCo., observes that just a few years back, &quot;layoff was a dirtyword,&quot; and corporate executives feared the public outcry thatfollowed layoff announcements. &quot;Now it has become a badge ofgood management. One reads annual reports and finds someonevery proud to announce that their head count is down,&quot; hesays with disapproval. &quot;Corporations have been too willing tolay off people to raise profits, as opposed to taking othermeasures, such as raising revenues.&quot;   Even the approach of Christmas doesn't seem to be slowingthe job-cutting trend. Says Mr. Lacey: &quot;The evidence is theyare cutting right through the holiday season.&quot;   While the recession is clearly accelerating the trend,some of the job cuts reflect a need for restructuring amongAmerican companies that was evident long before the downturnbegan. &quot;Most of this isn't directly recession-generated,&quot;insists David Nadler, a New York management consultant. &quot;Therecession just lowered the water level and revealed therocks.&quot;   In fact, job cuts resulting from corporate restructuringhave been prevalent throughout the 1980s, as companies havestruggled to survive in a competitive global market. Thattrend began picking up speed, analysts say, in 1989. Butthrough most of the '80s, the U.S. economy was creating jobsso rapidly that people could find work elsewhere withrelative ease. Today, that is no longer true.   And while cuts of 10,000 at TRW or 2,500 at Xerox may seemrelatively small in an economy with 125 million workers, theydo add up. Economist Audrey Freedman of the Conference Board,a business-research group, estimates that 25 millionAmericans -- that is, one out of every five people in theU.S. work force -- will be unemployed at some time this year.   One reason for the current pickup in layoffs is that somebusinesses want to take write-offs for restructuring beforeyear's end. They figure 1991 is already going to be a badyear for profits, and they might as well clear the way forfuture growth. &quot;We just decided to be more aggressive aboutit and see what we could do in one fell swoop to get itbehind us,&quot; said TRW Chairman Joseph T. Gorman in aninterview yesterday, after his company announced arestructuring plan that will ultimately slash 10,000 jobs.   TRW joins General Dynamics Corp., Tenneco Inc., GoodyearTire andamp; Rubber Co., Allied-Signal Inc. and other companieswith automotive or defense businesses that are restructuringbecause of uncertain futures. &quot;This is a recognition thattheir businesses have changed and the '90s competitive marketwill be different,&quot; says Eli S. Lustgarten, manufacturinganalyst with PaineWebber. &quot;They have to run very hard just tostay in place.&quot;   In announcing his company's cuts, GM Chairman RobertStempel made it clear that while the drastic steps are neededto make the company competitive in the long run, they couldhurt the economy -- and automobile sales -- in the near term.&quot;We're saying none of us will be competitive unless weshrink,&quot; Mr. Stempel said at a meeting with institutionalinvestors recently. &quot;But as you shrink, some of those jobsnever come back. That's not good for the country.&quot; Indeed,Mr. Stempel's counterpart at Ford Motor Co., Harold Poling,told reporters last week that consumers' fears of losingtheir jobs are the main reason for depressed car sales inrecent months.   Yesterday in joining the long list of job shedders, Xeroxsaid its elimination of 2,500 jobs will take place before themiddle of next year. Like IBM, Xerox has long been known forits humane employee policies. &quot;The uncertainty in the presentweak economic environment has required us to accelerate thisdirection to ensure our costs are contained,&quot; the companysaid.   Xerox, like many other companies, said it will attempt toaccomplish the cutbacks without firing people. &quot;A lot of therestructuring that people are talking about will take placeover a period of time,&quot; says Janet Norwood, the government'scommissioner of labor statistics. &quot;Many of those employmentreductions will take place through attrition or earlyretirement.&quot;   But Xerox acknowledges that in some cases it may have tomake &quot;involuntary layoffs.&quot; And in any event, theincreasingly frequent announcements of staff cuts are makingAmericans feel ever less secure in their jobs.   The nature of job cuts has also changed from earlierrecessions, when layoffs were concentrated almost exclusivelyamong blue-collar manufacturing and construction workers.&quot;The layoffs are more widespread industrially andoccupationally than usual,&quot; says Ms. Freedman of theConference Board. &quot;They are hitting managerial, technical,professional and clerical jobs that weren't reached soseverely in 1981-82.&quot;   As testament to that change, unemployment worries seem tobe rising most rapidly among white-collar workers. It is &quot;theWall Street Journal readership&quot; that is being hit, reportsWorkplace Trends' Mr. Lacey. Only 30% of the jobs being cut,he notes, are &quot;your classic production worker. By and large,these are managerial, administrative and technical people.&quot;The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that 53% ofwhite-collar workers cite unemployment as the nation's chiefproblem, up sharply from 40% in October.   One puzzle in the current environment is that the widelywatched unemployment rate remains at only 6.8%, well belowthe double-digit rates of the 1982 recession. Analysts citetwo reasons for that anomaly. First, some discouraged workershave simply stopped looking for jobs, and therefore no longercount among the unemployed. And second, the jobless rate isno longer being inflated by the heavy influx of baby boomersand women who were entering the work force for the first timein the 1970s and 1980s.   &quot;The unemployment rate is peculiar, but it's not a factworth wrestling with,&quot; says economist George Perry of theBrookings Institution. &quot;The fact is, employment has been veryweak.&quot;   Many economists argue the economy's growth is bettermeasured by the employment numbers put out by the LaborDepartment, which showed a steep drop of 241,000 jobs inNovember.   Moreover, unlike traditional recessionary layoffs, wherefactory or construction workers are sent home for severalweeks or months, many people whose jobs are being cut thistime have little hope of ever being re-hired. The layoffssweeping the computer industry, for instance, reflectlong-term, structural changes. Most of those jobs aren'tcoming back.   Digital Equipment Corp., which has said it will cut up to10,000 jobs through next June 30, is a good example. Many ofthe jobs it is shedding are in manufacturing but result fromthe fact that the company can now build the same number ofcomputers with fewer people. Digital's smaller rivals WangLaboratories Inc. and Data General Corp., have slashedmanufacturing jobs even more than Digital has.   Nor are the cuts at Allied-Signal, which announced lastmonth it would trim 14% of its salaried workers, likely toprove temporary. The move was initiated by the company'snewly named chief executive, Lawrence A. Bossidy, in responseto criticism that the company has too long ignored the bottomline.   Westinghouse Electric Corp., staggering from huge lossesin its credit unit, is also laying off 4,000 employees. AndEastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., has said it plans tocut its work force by 6,000.   It isn't just big companies that are cutting back. LastFriday, the National Federation of Independent Business saidthat 13% of small firms plan to reduce employment in the nextthree to six months, and just 9% plan to add workers.   &quot;Small business is adding little of positive note to theemployment outlook,&quot; said William Dunkelberg, the NFIB'schief economist.   In the long run, the latest round of job-cutting may wellresult in stronger and more competitive businesses. &quot;This isbad news if you work for one of these companies, but it'sprobably good news if you are a stockholder,&quot; says Mr. Perryof Brookings.   But in the short run, the cuts will clearly delay theeconomy's recovery. And they are causing some economists toquestion the U.S. economy's ability to grow strongly over thenext few years. &quot;There's no question in my mind that thejob-creating machine that seemed to be functioning somagnificently in the 1980s has suddenly sputtered to a haltin the early 1990s,&quot; says Mellon's Mr. Robertson.</TEXT></DOC>
