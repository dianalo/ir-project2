Newark Memorial (14-5) went on to a 2-0 victory.The Eagles finished at 18-7.;    &quot;It was definitely a gift,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Butwe'll take it. We've been struggling to score all season long. I told them wewere going to be aggressive on the bases. Kristi told me she knew she couldget the shortstop to chase her. It shows her experience.&quot;;    The Cougars(11-3 in league), who finished third in the MVAL behind Logan (13-1) andAmerican (12-2) must now wait until Sunday's seeding meeting to find out ifthey have qualified for the North Coast Section playoffs.
