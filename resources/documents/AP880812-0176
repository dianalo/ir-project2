At a hearing in U.S. District Court, lawyers for the politicalextremist said they would appeal Judge Robert E. Keeton's decisionordering a new trial.   Defense lawyers also said they would seek more information abouta February 1985 memo from FBI executive assistant director OliverRevell to then-FBI Director William Webster regarding an bombthreat against former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger thatallegedly involved LaRouche affiliates.   LaRouche, six aides and five political organizations are chargedwith conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation intoallegations that LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign raised morethan $2 million through credit card and loan fraud.   Keeton, who ordered the new trial Thursday three months afterdeclaring a mistrial, said he plans to schedule daylong dailysessions starting Oct. 3 and pre-screen jurors to guard againstcomplaints about the trial's length.   ``In light of my estimate that this trial is going to last ayear or longer, it's important to get in as many hours per day aspossible,'' Keeton said.   The first trial, which began last December, was suspended inMarch for hearings into government documents referring to LaRouche.Those included a memo from retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardSecord to then-National Security Council aide Oliver North,now-declassified FBI documents on information-gathering againstLaRouche, and other FBI, CIA and NSC records.   The defense has maintained that the FBI and CIA infiltratedLaRouche organizations to fabricate evidence of fraud.   Keeton halted all proceedings in May after excusing four jurorswho complained about the length and conduct of the case. That leftonly 10 jurors out of the original 12 and two alternates, and thedefense exercised its right not to continue with fewer than 12.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham said the FBI's 1985 memoand a 1982 telex about a bomb threat against Kissinger wereirrelevant to the fraud and conspiracy charges.   LaRouche attorney Daniel Alcorn said the document was pertinentbecause it was written after the government began its fraudinvestigation of LaRouche and could be used as evidence to provethe government set up LaRouche.   The defense Friday also withdrew motions to divide the case intoseparate trials for the credit card fraud, loan fraud andconspiracy charges. Attorneys said separate trials could haveprolonged the case even more because some witnesses would be calledthree or four times.   Markham said he expects the prosecution will produce 75 hours ofdirect testimony. Adding cross-examination by defense attorneys,Markham estimated the case would take 300 hours, or about 3{ months.   Defense lawyers, who in the first trial raised some issuesseveral times, refused to estimate how long their case would take.   Michael Riley, one of about a dozen LaRouche attorneys, saiddefendants would ask the federal appeals court to delay the trialuntil their appeal is heard.   The defense last month charged prosecutors with intentionallycausing the mistrial because its case ``was going nowhere.''Defendants had claimed a new trial would violate their FifthAmendment rights against being tried twice on the same charges.   LaRouche, who is seeking the presidency a fourth time, ischarged with one count of conspiracy for allegedly orderingsupporters to destroy records and refuse to cooperate withinvestigators. All six aides and the five organizations also arecharged with conspiracy, and four of the groups are charged withfraud.</TEXT></DOC>
