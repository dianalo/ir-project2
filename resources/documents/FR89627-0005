These changes, which neither expand nor limit the provisions ofthe EAR, affect andSection; 773.3(d)(2)(iv), Supplement No. 4 to Part 779(Additional Specifications for Certain Technical Data Requiring a ValidatedLicense to all Destinations Except Canada), and Supplement No. 1 to andSection;799.1 (the Commodity Control List).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> This rule is effective January 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Willard Fisher, Regulations Branch,Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-3856.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The specific technical corrections made by this final rule are listed below.(a) A final rule, published on November 27, 1987 (52 FR 45309), added anew ECCN 6598F to the Commodity Control List. The phrase ``Controls forECCN 6598F'' incorrectly read ``Controls for ECCN 6568F.'' This final rulecorrects the regulatory text by revising the phrase to read ``Controlsfor ECCN 6598F''. (b) A final rule, published on November 18, 1987 (52 FR 44101), amendedECCN 1533A by adding a new paragraph (c) to (Advisory) Note 7 for the People'sRepublic of China. Another final rule, published on May 13, 1988 (53 FR17021), also contained amendatory instructions for adding a new paragraph(c) to (Advisory) Note 7. This final rule clarifies the amendatory instructionsin the final rule of May 13, 1988 by indicating that the rule revises existingparagraph (c), rather than adding a new paragraph (c). (c) A final rule, published on March 10, 1988 (53 FR 7733), amended SupplementNo. 1 to andSection; 799.1 (the Commodity Control List) by redesignatingparagraph (b)(ii) as (b)(iii) and adding a new paragraph (b)(ii) to thelist of commodities controlled by ECCN 1091A. Another final rule, publishedon May 23, 1988 (53 FR 18271), also amended the list of commodities controlledby ECCN 1091A by revising paragraph (b)(ii) and adding a new paragraph(b)(iii). The amendatory language in the final rule of May 23, 1988 shouldhave contained instructions revising paragraph (b)(iii) and adding a newparagraph (b)(iv). This final rule corrects the amendatory language inthe final rule of May 23, 1988 by revising the references to paragraphs(b)(ii)(2) and (b)(iii) to read (b)(iii)(2) and (b)(iv), respectively.(d) A final rule, published on July 5, 1988 (53 FR 25146), contained amendatoryinstructions to revise ECCN 1537A by redesignating the Advisory Note forthe People's Republic of China as Advisory Note 8 for the People's Republicof China and by moving that Advisory Note to the end of text. The AdvisoryNote had already been placed at the end of the text when it was added toECCN 1537A by a final rule published on December 27, 1985 (50 FR 52907).This final rule corrects the amendatory language in the final rule on July5, 1988 by removing the instruction to place the Advisory Note at the endof the text. (e) A final rule, published on September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35459) amendedandSection; 779.4(d) by redesignating paragraph (d)(21) as paragraph (d)(24)and by adding new paragraphs (d)(21), (d)(22), and (d)(23). Another finalrule, published on September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35803) redesignated paragraph(d)(21) as (d)(22) and added a new paragraph (d)(21). The amendatory languagein the final rule on September 15, 1988 failed to take into account thechanges to andSection; 779.4(d) that were made by the final rule of September14, 1988. This final rule corrects the amendatory language in the September15, 1988 rule to indicate that paragraph (d)(24) is redesignated as paragraph(d)(25) and a new paragraph (d)(24) is added. The September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35459) final rule amended Supplement No.4 to Part 779 (Additional Specifications for Certain Technical Data Requiringa Validated License to all Destinations Except Canada) by adding new paragraphs(5) through (9). The September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35803) final rule also addeda new paragraph (5) to Supplement No. 4. The amendatory language in thefinal rule of September 15, 1988 should have indicated that a new paragraph(10) was added. This final rule corrects the amendatory language of theSeptember 15, 1988 rule by including an instruction to designate the newparagraph as paragraph (10). The September 14, 1988 (53 FR 35465) final rule amended ECCN 1746A by addingnew paragraphs (k) and (l). The September 15, 1988 (53 FR 53805) finalrule also added paragraphs (k) and (l), but with a text that differed slightlyfrom that contained in the earlier rule. This final rule corrects the amendatorylanguage for the final rule of September 15, 1988 to indicate that existingparagraphs (k) and (l) are revised. (f) A final rule, published on September 19, 1988 (53 FR 36272), includedamendatory instructions to revise ECCN 1460A by adding the phrase ``andthe People's Republic of China'' after the phrase ``Country Groups QSWYZ'',in paragraphs (b), (c)(1) and (c)(2) of the list of equipment controlled.This change had already been made in a final rule published on September14, 1988 (53 FR 35459). This final rule corrects the amendatory languagein the final rule of September 19, 1988 by removing the instruction addingthe phrase ``and the People's Republic of China''. (g) A final rule, published on September 20, 1988 (53 FR 36439), includedamendatory instructions to revise ECCN 1501A by changing the referenceto ``db'' that appeared in paragraph (e) of the Technical Note followingparagraph (c)(2)(iii) to read ``dB''. The amendatory instruction shouldhave referenced paragraph (c), instead of paragraph (e), since there wasno paragraph (e) in the Technical Note. This final rule corrects the amendatoryinstruction to indicate that ECCN 1501A is amended by revising the phrase``db'' in paragraph (c) of the Technical Note following paragraph (c)(2)(iii)to read ``dB''. (h) A final rule, published on September 21, 1988 (53 FR 36560), revisedthe ``GLV $ Value Limit'' paragraph for a number of Export Control CommodityNumbers (ECCNs). This rule inadvertently included nine ECCNs that had beenremoved from the Commodity Control List (CCL) by final rules publishedearlier in the month. ECCN 1133A was removed from the CCL by a final rulepublished on September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35799). ECCNs 4460B and 1801A wereremoved from the CCL by a final rule published on September 14, 1988 (53FR 35459). ECCNs 1603A, 1649A, 1658A, 1670A, 1671A, and 1674A were removedfrom the CCL by a final rule published on September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35803).This final rule corrects the amendatory language in the final rule of September21, 1988 by removing the references to these ECCNs. (i) A final rule, published on October 27, 1988 (53 FR 43427), amendedandSection; 773. by removing paragraph (d)(4), which addressed processingdata rate exception requests for distribution license applications. Paragraph(d)(2)(iv), which also addresses these requests and contains a referenceto paragraph (d)(4), was not removed. This rule corrects the amendatorylanguage of the October 27, 1988 rule by adding an instruction removingparagraph (d)(2)(iv).
