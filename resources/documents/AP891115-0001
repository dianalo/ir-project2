With about 8 percent of the votes counted, Collor de Mello, wholed most exit polls with 30 percent, had 2,225,909 votes, followedby left-wing populist Leonel Brizola with 1,628,735 votes, saidGlobo TV, the nation's largest network.   Late Wednesday the government announced a 12-hour delay in theofficial count, reportedly because of computer problems.   In third place was Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of theMarxist-oriented Workers' Party with 1,561,739 votes, trailed bySen. Mario Covas of the left-of-center Brazilian Social DemocracyParty with 1,345,248 votes but with surprising leads in two of thecountry's largest cities, the network said.   Covas, a dark-horse candidate, held a strong lead in Sao Paulo,the nation's most populous city, and was a solid second in BeloHorizonte, the TV network said.   The network said some 130,000 people voted for popular TVgame-show host Silvio Santos, who tried to enter the race two weeksbefore the election but whose candidacy was thrown out by theElectoral Court.   More than 82 million people were eligible to vote for asuccessor to President Jose Sarney, who was chosen by an electoralcollege when the generals relinquished power in 1985 after twodecades' rule. Voting was mandatory for Brazilians aged 18-69.   The chief of Brazil's federal police, Romeu Tuma, said therewere ``no significant incidents to mar the voting. We are verypleased with how calm the day was.''   Final results are not expected until Saturday and, on theassumption no one gains a majority, a runoff between the twoleaders is planned for Dec. 17.   The first official results announced were from a relativehandful of Brazilians who cast ballots in embassies and consulatesin 19 countries, with Collor de Mello leading followed by Covas andda Silva.   Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old former state governor, has been aharsh critic of Sarney. Leading in the polls since April, hisdapper good looks and anti-corruption platform made Collor de Mellopopular with the poor, a majority in the Brazilian electorate.   Sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annualinflation rate of at least 1,300 percent.   The Superior Electoral Court first announced results would startbeing released at 8:00 p.m. local time, just three hours after thepolls closed. However, that time was pushed back to 11:00 p.m. andthen to Thursday.   An election official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told areporter there was a problem with computer links between Brasiliaand far-off voting precincts.   Parties ranged from the Communists to one formerly backed by themilitary entered candidates.   Fully 73 percent of the Brazilian electorate had never voted forpresident. Lines lines of voters began forming before dawn, hoursbefore polls opened at 8 a.m., from the Amazon jungle in the northto the southern pampas.   The results showed the candidates leading in their regionalstrongholds _ Collor de Mello led in the federal capital ofBrasilia, in northeastern Maceio and southeastern Curitiba.   Da Silva, an ex-labor leader, held wide leads in southeasternBelo Horizonte and the two northeastern Atlantic coastal cities ofSalvador and Recife.   Brizola, of the Democratic Labor Party, led in the southerncapital cities of Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil'ssecond-largest city.   Promotional spots on nationwide television said that whereas in1960 it took three months to count the votes, this year, withmodern computer technology, the results would be announced asquickly as possible.   The federal electoral court promised results by 8 p.m. but thatwas postponed several times for reasons not explained.   Election officials directed that ballots cast at the 250,000voting stations in the nation's 4,445 counties be flown to Brasiliaafter local counting.   Several candidates raised the possibility of fraud. RobertoRosas of the Superior Electoral Court responded on Wednesday:   ``Many candidates are setting up parallel vote-counting, forfear of fraud, but fraud is impossibe and there is no `virus' or`microbe' that can affect our computers.''   Collor de Mello voted early in Maceio and flew back to Brasiliato follow the count for president, who will serve five years andcannot seek re-election.   The election took place on a national holiday, the 100thanniversary of the republic that ended the reign of Emperor PedroII.   In Rio, many Brizola sympathizers wore red bandannas, thecandidate's trademark. In Brasilia, election officials delayedvoting for two hours and ordered the bandannas removed.   The penalty for not voting is a fine of up to 20 new cruzados,about $3.30.   A 1988 constitutional reform also enfranchised citizens aged 16and 17, but voting is not compulsory for them.   Liquor sales were forbidden from midnight Tuesday to 6 a.m.Thursday.   Janio Quadros won Brazil's last free and direct presidentialelection, in 1960. He resigned after seven months and the ensuingconfusion led to a military coup in 1964.   The army canceled direct presidential elections, although theypermitted some regional elections.   Sarney, 59, said this election ``concludes the transition todemocracy.''   ``There has never been so much freedom in the country,'' he saidTuesday night. ``In homes, at work, in the streets, opinions aredivided and no one is afraid, because we know democracy exists.''   He did not publicly support any candidate, and described hisrole in the election as a ``magistrate.''</TEXT></DOC>
