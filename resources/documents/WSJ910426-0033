But in the one exception, Pennzoil will vote its 32.9million Chevron shares, a 9.4% stake, against Chevronmanagement's efforts to keep an anti-takeover measure intact.</LP><TEXT>   Pennzoil's chairman, J. Hugh Liedtke, said in an interviewthat Pennzoil sides with management on the routine selectionof an auditor and will vote against two South Africandivestment provisions as management has recommended. Pennzoilwill vote for management's slate of directors, which includesChevron's chairman, Kenneth Derr. &quot;We're entirely comfortablewith the operations of Chevron,&quot; Mr. Liedtke said.   But at next month's meeting in San Francisco, Chevron'shome town, Pennzoil will vote for a stockholder proposal thatChevron management opposes, one that would either eliminateor submit to a shareholder vote the &quot;poison pill&quot; Chevronadopted right after Pennzoil disclosed its stake in December1989.   A Pennzoil spokesman stressed that Mr. Liedtke wasn'ttrying to round up shareholder support on the poison pillproposal. &quot;Pennzoil's vote is not a recommendation for othershareholders,&quot; he said. As it stands, the poison pill istriggered if one holder's stake reaches 10%. Pennzoil hasexpressed some interest in exceeding that level, simplybecause it wants to invest in Chevron all of the $2.6 billionit won in a historic legal battle with Texaco Inc. Atpresent, it has spent $2.2 billion on its Chevron stake.   After initial intense legal efforts to shake Pennzoil,Chevron now seems resigned, and indeed, more comfortable withthe arrangement. In a recent interview, Chevron Vice ChairmanJames Sullivan said that Pennzoil officials have said they&quot;want to be a passive investor. They have done what theysaid.&quot;   Mr. Sullivan noted that Chevron has litigation againstPennzoil outstanding that it is still pursuing. But he saidthe tone of the relationship has changed. &quot;Since a year and aquarter has gone by, we have to say it's less intense,&quot; hesaid.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Chevron shares fell $1.125 to close at $77.875. That's wellabove the average price paid by Pennzoil of $67.35 a share.In fact, at Pennzoil's annual meeting yesterday, PresidentJames Pate boasted that the Chevron investment &quot;has increasedalmost $400 million.&quot;   Earlier this week, Chevron said first-quarter earningsjumped 18%. Also, Chevron boosted its dividend 6.5%, whichPennzoil said will represent about a $6 million increase inits annual earnings.   Pennzoil's results have been languishing for some time.The company said yesterday that first-quarter net income fellto $22 million, or 55 cents a share, from $32.7 million, or85 cents a share, in last year's quarter, which includedgains of $6.9 million. Revenue declined to $549.2 millionfrom $553.2 million.   Mr. Pate blamed the lower profits on the collapse ofnatural gas prices. He said the company's oil refining andsulphur units posted higher profits but not enough to offsetthe weakness in gas markets.   Pennzoil shares fell $1.875 a share on the Big Boardyesterday, closing at $72.50.</TEXT></DOC>
