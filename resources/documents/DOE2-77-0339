<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0339 </DOCNO><TEXT>The first seagoing test of a prototype laser/fiber-optic system for insitu detection of ocean chlorophyll fluorescence is described. Radiationat 488 nm originating from a shipboard argon laser was transmitted through20 of 200-{mu}m core optical fiber to the distal tip mounted on the microstructureprofiler, the Rapid Sampling Vertical Profiler. The backscattered fluorescenceemission signal was collected through the same fiber and processed onboard ship. A series of measurements indicated that (1) successful isolationof ship-induced vibrations could be achieved using our optical benchframework to maintain optical alignments; (2) ambient chlorophyll concentrationscould be detected in situ; (3) a Raman scattering signal from water couldalso be detected and should provide an internal standard against whichchlorophyll fluorescence may be calibrated.</TEXT></DOC>
