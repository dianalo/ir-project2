Mr. Bush's comments, made at a joint news conference herewith Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, were hisstarkest expression yet of fear that the war against Iraqcould lead to attempts to break that country into pieces,something that all America's Arab allies think would deeplydestabilize the region. Mr. Bush said he hasn't any evidencethat Iran is trying to pull away parts of Iraq, but declaredthat &quot;Iran must not and should not try to annex any of theterritory of Iraq.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The president said in his bluntest language yet that theway to end the instability that threatens to tear Iraq intopieces is to remove Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. He said itwill be &quot;almost impossible&quot; to have normal relations withIraq while Saddam Hussein stays.   And Mr. Bush raised a new complaint that he hinted isfurther hardening U.S. attitudes toward the Saddam Husseinregime. He said Iraqi troops may be using helicopters toattack civilian foes of Saddam Hussein. Use of thehelicopters to fight civilians could delay completion of aformal cease-fire agreement and the withdrawal of allAmerican troops from southern Iraq, Mr. Bush declared.   Other administration officials charged that Iraq has usedits fleet of helicopter gunships frequently, in severallocations, to quell the anti-Saddam Hussein uprisings thathave broken out, particularly in southern and northern Iraq.   U.S. and Arab officials alike long have worried that oneeffect of an Iraqi military defeat could be attempts byfactions inside and outside the government to break apart thenation. Though Iraq's government traditionally has been runby Sunni Muslims who predominate in central Iraq, the nationhas a Shiite Muslim majority. Many of those Shiites live insouthern Iraq, and many have cultural and religious ties toShiites in neighboring Iran.   In addition, northern Iraq is populated by Kurds, who havelong agitated against the Iraqi government and in favor oftheir own nation in unison with Kurds living in Turkey andIran.   Iran has denied that it wants to break off Shiite sectionsof Iraq to claim as its own. But U.S. officials say theybelieve there have been some sporadic, small raids into Iraqby Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops to support Shiitedissidents trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein.   Mr. Bush didn't give any hint of how the U.S. wouldrespond if it thought Iran was trying to dismember Iraq. &quot;Ihave no evidence that that's what Iran is trying to do,&quot; Mr.Bush said at a news conference. But, he went on, just as Iranhas said it is worried about a permanent U.S. militarypresence in the Persian Gulf, he wanted to declare thatIranian efforts at &quot;grabbing territory&quot; would be &quot;the worstthing they could do.&quot;   The president said he is &quot;concerned about the instability&quot;in Iraq. He said the Canadians, the Americans and othercoalition partners didn't want to see an &quot;unstable Iraqcreating a vacuum in that part of the world.&quot;   U.S. intelligence officials said it isn't clear whetherthe sporadic Revolutionary Guard raids into eastern Iraqiborder areas are part of an organized effort directed fromTehran.   Iranian dissidents, who are backed by Iraq, claim that theattacks are much larger and more systematic. The oppositiongroup, called the People's Mojahedin, claimed yesterday thatthe Revolutionary Guards had staged major cross-border raidson Sunday and Monday into Iraq's Dyallah province. They saidIranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani had even gone to WesternIran to visit the forces involved in the attacks, and that anIranian Shiite religious leader had traveled repeatedly toIraq's rebellious Basra area.   Mr. Bush reiterated that he wants American troops to leaveIraqi territory as soon as possible. But by raising thequestion of Iraqi use of helicopters against internal foes healso threw up a new potential roadblock.   &quot;I must confess to some concern about the use of Iraqihelicopters in violation of what our understanding was,&quot; Mr.Bush said. &quot;That's one that has got to be resolved beforewe're going to have any permanence to any cease-fire.&quot;   The U.S. also has warned Iraq not to use chemical weaponsagainst dissidents, and has implied it might resume air raidson Iraqi troops if they gas government foes.   But the U.S. seems torn by conflicting pressures as itconsiders the turmoil in Iraq. On one hand, the Bushadministration is worried that continued insurrection in Iraqcould invite more open efforts by Shiite dissidents, Iran orsome Kurdish groups to tear apart the country.   On the other hand, the administration hopes the dissidentgroups can cause enough trouble to succeed in toppling SaddamHussein. The ideal situation for the Bush administrationmight be for the anti-government agitators to cause enoughtrouble that somebody in the Iraqi army or elsewhere in thegovernment decides that Saddam Hussein must be pushed asidebefore the situation deteriorates too far.   That may be one reason Mr. Bush yesterday became moreblunt in his calls for Saddam Hussein's ouster. &quot;It is hardto see how an Iraq with him at the helm can rejoin the familyof peace-loving nations,&quot; Mr. Bush said.   On his visit to Canada, Mr. Bush also signed, along withMr. Mulroney, a treaty formalizing agreements the two nationshave made to cut acid rain. The treaty formally commits theU.S. to make the reductions in acid rain-causing pollutantsset in the Clean Air Act passed last year. William Reilly,the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said thetreaty will cut in half the airborne pollutants that havepoisoned Canadian lakes.</TEXT></DOC>
