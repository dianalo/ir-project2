This is a revisionof the September 15, 1989 Notice of Intent which indicated that the EISwould address all potential management practices scheduled in the TrailCreek area for the period 1989 to 1995. Other potential management practiceslisted in the original Notice of Intent included trail construction andreconstruction, trail head construction and improvement, watershed andfisheries improvement, and construction of interpretive facilities.This EIS will tier to the Beaverhead Forest Land and Resource Managementplan of April 1986, which provides overall guidance in achieving the desiredfuture condition for the area. The purpose and goal for the proposed actionsare to help satisfy short-term demands for timber, to maintain a continuoussupply of timber in the future, and to provide big game habitat.Because a significant amount of scoping has occurred since the originalNotice of Intent, no additional formal comment period is planned priorto the release of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement [DEIS]. Commentand suggestion will be accepted on the issues, alternative, or impactsof alternatives from now until the end of the 45 day comment period onthe DEIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments concerning the proposed management activities wereto have been received by October 15, 1988 (refer to original NOI) in orderto be used in preparing the DEIS. Additional comments will be accepteduntil 45 days after filing of the DEIS with the Environmental ProtectionAgency (40 CFR 1506.10(c)). These comments will be used in preparing theDEIS or the final EIS depending on the timing of the comment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send written comments to Ronald Prichard, Forest Supervisor,610 N.

The areas of proposedtimber harvest, regeneration and road construction/reconstruction willoccur within Forest Plan Management Areas 16, 20, 21, and 26.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management Area Descriptions</ITAG>Management Area 16_Areas that are available and suitable for timber managementwith other important resource values.Management Area 20_Same as management area 19 except that timber managementwill be at moderate levels permitting cultural treatments.Management Area 21_A variety of forested lands with high wildlife valuessuch as summer range, elk calving areas, security cover or limited winterrange; outside of existing range allotments; classified as suitable fortimber management.Management Area 26_Areas of key wildlife summer or winter range on a varietyof physical environments; where included in existing livestock allotments,livestock will be controlled to protect wildlife; classified as suitablefor timber management and will be managed at low intensity levels to minimizeconflicts with wildlife.Proposed timber harvest, regeneration and road construction/reconstructionwould occur in lower Sawpit Creek, near the Anderson Mountain road, inupper Elk Creek, in upper Prairie Creek and near the confluence of Trailand Joseph Creeks.The analysis will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will bethe ``no-action'' alternative, in which all harvest and regeneration activitieswould not be implemented. Other alternatives will examine various levelsand locations of harvest and regeneration in response to issues, goalsand objectives.Two RARE II roadless areas are located within the Trail Creek area andcould be affected by the proposed timber harvest regeneration and roadconstruction. The potentially affected roadless areas are, the Beaver Lakeroadless area 1-003 (portion 1-003a) and the Anderson Mountain roadlessarea andplusmin;1-942 which is located on both the Beaverhead and SalmonNational Forest. The Beaver Lake roadless area totals  13,474  acres, the  west  portion 1-003a totals 7,926 acres. The Anderson Mountain roadlessarea andplusmin;1-942 totals 48,451 acres of which 30,331 acres is locatedon the Beaverhead National Forest.The Forest Service will analyze and document the direct, indirect, andcumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. In addition, theEIS will disclose the analysis of site specific mitigation measures, theireffectiveness and a plan to measure their effectiveness.Scoping has already been conducted through individual and public meetingsbeginning in the spring of 1988. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlifeand Parks has contributed to the analysis. At this point, future publicparticipation will be especially important in the review of the draft EIS.However, people may visit with Forest Service officials at any time duringthe analysis and prior to the decision.The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) and available for public review in April 1989. At that time the EPAwill publish a notice of availability of the DEIS in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After a 45-day public comment period, the commentsreceived will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in the finalenvironmental impact statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completedby August, 1989. The Forest Service will respond in the FEIS to the commentsreceived on the DEIS. The Forest Supervisor who is the responsible officialfor this EIS will make a decision regarding this proposal considering thecomments, responses and environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS,and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The decision and reasonsfor the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision.Ronald Prichard, Forest Supervisor of the Beaverhead National Forest, isthe Responsible Official.<ITAG tagnum="6">Ronald C.

The amendmentto Permit No. 0018 would provide for incorporation of a precious metalssmelter within SMC's existing facilities. The purpose of the proposed smelterwould be to process platinum group metals (PGM) concentrate from SMC'sexisting mine and mill. The facility would be designed with aditional capacityto process concentrate from a second PGM mine proposed for location onthe East Boulder River, should it become operational in the mid-1990's.Federal, State and local agencies, potential developers, and other individualsor organizations who may be interested in or affected by the decision areinvited to participate in the scoping process. This process will include:1. Identification of potential issues.2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.3. Elimination of insignificant issues or those which have been coveredby a previous environmental review.4. Identification of additional reasonable alternatives.5. Determination of potential cooperating agencies and assignment of responsibilities.The Forest Service and Department of State Lands will hold public meetingsduring the scoping process.
