(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shaken by anonymous letters containingracial slurs and threats against blacks, students at a smallliberal arts college said Friday they plan a campus march ofsolidarity against racism.   Hand-written letters addressed to MacMurray College's 35 to 40black students and the school's only black faculty member werefound Thursday in their campus mailboxes.   The letters included racial epithets such as ``Uncle Tom'' andmade personal slurs tailored specifically to recipients. One letterthreatened: ``Watch your back, nigger.''   Edward Mitchell, president of the 620-student college, calledthe acts ``intolerable'' and promised to expel any studentresponsible. At a news conference held by college officials,students said they would march Monday from the campus center to thecollege chapel, where white, black and Hispanic students wouldspeak against racism.   ``We have decided that we won't talk about who is to blame,''said Ricky Bragg, a black sophomore majoring in political science.``That's useless. We have simply decided we are going to cometogether and we are going to fight this as MacMurray students.''   The city's police chief, Tom Weeks, said investigatorsinterviewed students and staff at the college, but had no suspects.The letters were being examined for fingerprints, Weeks said.   ``Just having the fingerprints isn't going to tell us muchunless we have a suspect,'' he said.   The letters apparently were left at a mailroom at the campuscenter, where employees unwittingly placed them in mailboxes,school officials said.   Jacksonville is a city of 20,000 people in western Illinois,about 85 miles north of St. Louis.   Only a few students actually saw the letters before they wereremoved from mailboxes, the officials said. Black students who sawthe letters said they were addressed to students by name and campusmailbox number.   ``If you were overweight, he called you a fat bitch and stufflike this,'' said Desmond Williams, a junior majoring in businessadministration.   ``Each note had something that pertained to you personally. Soobviously, there was a great deal of time and effort put intopreparing these,'' he said.   Williams said his envelope contained letters cut from a magazineor newspaper to spell the word ``nigger.''   Black students met Thursday night.   ``We have some (students) that have obviously experienced racismelsewhere and are very defensive about the issue and are ready totake action, but I think the level-headed students are trying tokeep them in line as much as possible,'' said Laura Jordan, a blacksenior majoring in music education.   The college's only black faculty member, assistant footballcoach Gerald Young, also received one of the letters. He said theincident doesn't reflect broader racism on campus.   ``I think that is the work of a small group of individuals, ifnot one person,'' he said. ``I think we did the right thing byimmediately addressing the problem and bringing it out to thepublic.</TEXT></DOC>
