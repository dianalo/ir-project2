Prices ended weak, just above their lows of the day, with December delivery gold at $438.80 an ounce, for a loss of $4.10, while September silver lost 15 cents an ounce to $6.6350. October platinum declined $5.20 an ounce to $531.10.    Prior to the opening of trading, the Commerce Department said the seasonally adjusted U.S. merchandise trade deficit rose to $12.54 billion in June from a revised $9.76 billion in May. The May deficit was lowered from the original figure of $10.93 billion, the department said.    While imports in June rose 5.7%, exports actually fell 2.4%, the figures showed. And traders indicated that the seemingly odd market reaction reflected their focus on the latter. While the $39.35 billion in June imports is a record, the drop in exports &quot;is not inflationary,&quot; contended William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;If, on the other hand, exports had been at a record, it would have taken a heated economy to supply that demand and that would have been inflationary and bullish for precious metals,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    Another price-depressing factor was the rebound of the dollar, which, according to Mr. O'Neill, also reflected a building concentration of attention through the session on the exports slippage. &quot;The dollar was hit immediately after the release of the trade report, but it rebounded, and as it rose, precious metals fell,&quot; he said.    John Norris, director of precious metals trading at Citibank, cited the inability of precious metal prices to rally in early trading, following the release of the trade figure. &quot;The market turned down and triggered stop-loss selling by traders who'd previously bought contracts. The selling then became widespread,&quot; Mr. Norris said.    Mr. Norris noted that the Federal Reserve also reported that the capacity utilization of U.S. factories, utilities and mines during July was at 83.5%, up from 83.1% in June and the highest since March 1980.    &quot;That should have been a price-supporting figure, also,&quot; he said. &quot;But with all these strong economic figures that have been coming out, I have the feeling that traders are concerned the Federal Reserve may tighten credit again,&quot; he said.    Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York, said he saw &quot;tremendous inflationary implications in the higher trade deficit, and it should have been bullish for precious metals and bearish for the dollar.&quot;    However, he observed, &quot;the Federal Reserve has been keeping interest rates higher than the rate of inflation and this has been bullish for the dollar and bearish for precious metals.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:   LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Cattle futures prices fell amid speculation that the hot weather will curb demand for steaks and roasts. &quot;The heat has finally risen high enough for a long enough period of time to cause traders to anticipate reduced demand for heavy cuts of meat,&quot; said Paul Colman, a livestock analyst for Crofoot Financial Services Inc., Emporia, Kan. &quot;Do you want to go home and cook a pot roast? You'll probably want to eat a crab salad.&quot; Meatpackers and brokers report slack retail demand for livestock, analysts said; most have already stocked up on meat for the Labor Day holiday. Another factor was Monday's Agriculture Department cattle report, which signaled greater-than-expected supplies through the beginning of next year. The monthly survey of cattle on feedlots in seven major beef-producing states showed that more young animals than expected were channeled onto feedlots last month. &quot;The report ended up whacking the market,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, a livestock analyst for Sterling Research Corp. Hog futures prices fell amid speculation that slaughterings will increase over the next few weeks.    CURRENCIES: Major foreign currency futures fell as the dollar posted an impressive rebound following news of a widening of the U.S. trade deficit. The June trade gap grew to a seasonally adjusted $12.54 billion from a revised $9.76 billion in May, the Commerce Department said. Many traders had expected the report to show an $11 billion trade deficit. Despite the negative implications of the report for the dollar, there was &quot;tremendous demand&quot; for the U.S. unit after it skidded below 1.86 marks, a crucial support point, one trader said. Many local traders, or independent professionals, sold foreign currency contracts heavily on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as a result, in response, in part, to similar technical factors.    ENERGY: Statistics released late yesterday by the American Petroleum Institute showed, as expected, an increase in U.S. gasoline and distillate, or heating oil, inventories last week. Crude oil stocks declined as imports fell, but crude oil inventories still far exceed year-ago levels. Several traders described yesterday's oil-market activity as featureless, and said that prices drifted lower on a lack of interest. One trader noted &quot;a bit of selling&quot; in response to Saudi Arabia's denial of reports that its representatives met with Iranian officials to discuss oil-production related issues and resumption of diplomatic ties. </TEXT></DOC>
