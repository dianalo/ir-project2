In another report, former presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Fordcalled on President-elect George Bush to close all insolvent Sandamp;Lswithin two years.   ``The current approach of merging or selling insolventinstitutions ... defers but does not solve the problem,'' Ford andCarter said in their report, entitled ``American Agenda.''   The two former presidents said the industry must continue to payfor the cleanup of ailing institutions, but they acknowledged, ``thenext president and Congress (also) must go to the taxpayers.''   GAO analyst Craig Simmons said his agency's call for swiftlyclosing insolvent thrift institutions was an implicit criticism ofthe current Federal Home Loan Bank Board policy of rescuing failedthrifts by providing private investors with government cash andguarantees against future loss.   Simmons said the GAO was not against all mergers, but said so farthe bank board hasn't had the money to recognize all the losses andis covering them with open-ended guarantees.   ``They're not really resolving the problem in the sense ofputting it behind them,'' he said.   The GAO also said the problem was too large for the industry tobear alone and said the ``depositing public'' must help, eitherthrough an appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge.   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said ``there areinherent dangers to local economies'' in closing too manyinstitutions. Selling too much of the property from failed Sandamp;Ls toofast would drag down the value of property held by healthyinstitutions, he said.   ``There are places in the country where wholesale closings wouldresult in no services to a community,'' he said. ``... It would bedevastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations in a state likeTexas.''   The bank board has resolved 146 cases so far this year, but only26 of them by closing an institution, he said.   Both the GAO and the former presidents recommended reforms toprevent a repeat of the Sandamp;L mess, estimated to cost $50 billion to$100 billion to resolve.   Carter and Ford said the FSLIC should be administratively mergedwith the fund for commercial banks under a common regulatory board,a move opposed by the Sandamp;L industry. They called for unspecifiedreforms to the deposit insurance system.   Simmons said the GAO believed a fundamental reform of depositinsurance was not needed immediately and could delay the resolutionof the crisis, although it did recommend ``reconsidering the wisdomof the regulatory distinctions between thrift institutions andcommercial banks.''   The agency suggested experimenting with several reforms. One,called risk-based deposit insurance, would charge higher premiums tobanks that make risky investments. Another, known as a narrow bankproposal, would restrict Sandamp;Ls to investing deposits in nearlyrisk-free areas such as government securities.</TEXT></DOC>
