But the Supreme Court last month upheld its constitutionality,triggering the drive in Congress to nullify the regulation with the amendmentwithholding funds to enforce it.;    Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who led anunsuccessful challenge to the amendment within the Appropriations Committeelast week, agreed that &quot;the votes don't appear to be there&quot; to defeat it onthe floor.;    &quot;And I'm sensitive to the fact members don't like to vote onthe abortion issue over and over,&quot; Weber said.;    Planned Parenthood and themedical establishment, including the American Medical Association, have wageda high-priced campaign against the abortion-counseling ban, arguing that itwould abridge free speech, deny poor women access to information onreproductive matters and interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.;   The free-speech and medical-ethics issues have swayed some anti-abortionlawmakers. Rep. Bill Zeliff, R-N.H., a freshman member of Congress whocampaigned against federal funding for abortion, said Tuesday that he leansstrongly to overturning the regulation.;    &quot;I have resolved in my mind thatthis is a First Amendment issue and an issue about doctor-patientrelationship,&quot; he said. &quot;Doctors should not be bound by some brochure.&quot;;   Republican House members and political operatives also noted public-opinionpolls reflecting widespread public disapproval of the Supreme Court ruling.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910626  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  379  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 26, 199100178160,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
