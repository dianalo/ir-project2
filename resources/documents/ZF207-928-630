 Theskeptics say it is a gross understatement that doesn't take into account themany losses that go unreported every year.andP;  Why would major breaches in datasecurity go unreported?andP;  There are actually several good reasons, expertspoint out.andP;  Imagine you were the CEO of a major financial institution, forexample.andP;  Would you want your customers to know about a major loss due to aviolation of computer security?andM;While we must admit at the outset that no one can really measure with anyaccuracy the annual cost in dollars of security breaches, it is fair to saythat whatever the annual loss, it is big by any measure.andP;  By nearly allaccounts, moreover, it is getting bigger.andM;The matter is clearly a large and complex one, and beyond the scope of anyone article.andP;  By narrowing the number of security considerations, though, wecan more effectively address some particular concerns.andP;  What we want toexamine here is the fundamental problem of computer security and therequirements that dealing with it imposes on systems and users who need it.andO;Considered will be the reasons why we are seeing such requirements develop,how they are being measured, and some of the dilemmas faced by users andmanufacturers in the computer industry.andP;  To make it easier to understand someof the issues involved, we will also present an information-security model.andO;Finally, we will describe in greater detail some of the major issues ininformation security today.andM;Information security is not a new concern.andP;  People have worried about it forcenturies when they have needed to keep certain pieces of information frombecoming public knowledge.andP;  In early Greek history, for instance, there areaccounts of the heads of messengers being shaved and information beingpermanently written on their scalps.andP;  After their hair grew back, themessengers were sent off to their destinations, where their heads were shavedand the messages delivered.andM;Much of the information we deal with nowadays is &quot;time-sensitive&quot;: the moreadvanced its age, the lower its value.andP;  Some information, of course, may beof unlimited value; the computerized codes used to trigger the launch ofnuclear missiles is an example.andP;  Even routine business information, though,such as information about financial transactions, plans for corporate mergersor acquisitions, or development schemes for new products, can easily bevalued in the millions of dollars.andP;  The value of this type of information issignificantly reduced over time, especially once events or changes have madeit public knowledge.andM;One important aspect of &quot;information security&quot; is the protection of data asit is being transmitted from sender to receiver.andP;  Note that the senders andreceivers do not need to be human beings--often they are computer systemsthat communicate with one another.andP;  The sender may be a workstation and thereceiver may be another workstation, or a storage device, or a network, or aperipheral, for example.andM;The fact that senders and receivers of information can comprise any number ofpeople or systems points up the fact that typical computer operations havebecome more complicated because products now exist that were unknown not morethan ten years ago.andP;  Personal computers and workstations, printers andplotters, local- and wide-are networks--among many other devices andsystems--are commonly used pieces of equipment.andP;  Those who configure theseproducts to meet users' or an organization's data-processing requirementsoften give little or no thought to information-security matters.andM;Figure 1 shows the scope of the security measures that may be required toprotect data.andP;  Most computer users today work with applications software thatincludes an interface to an operating system.andP;  Two or more computer systemsconnected together, of course, require networking hardware and software.andO;Ensuring information security, then, necessitates maintaining a specific setof security attributes across all these components and their interfaces.andP;  Inaddition to the basics, there may be requirements for dta encryption, deviceaccess control, meeting &quot;Tempest&quot; standards (government specifications forthe control of intelligible emissions), or magnetic remanence (the ability toread images of data written to magnetic media even after it is erased), amongmany others.andM;According to a study done by International Data Corp. in 1988, worldwidesales of personal computers are anticipated to exceed 20 million units in1990.andP;  Add to that figure the number of local-area networks, workstations,minicomputers, and mainframes already installed, and the outlines of a majorinformation-security problem begin to emerge.andP;  How do we protect informationon systems that are changing so fast that many of their components areconsidered antiques once they are ten years old (or often even much younger)?andM;Sparked by several technological advancements, sales of computer productshave grown exponentially over the last ten years.andP;  Faster and fastermachines, built using faster, more efficient microprocessors, have made itpossible to manufacture and market much less expensive equipment.andO;Microprocessors today are being used in cars, homes, offices, and factoriesto control more and more tasks that used to be controlled manually.andP;  And thetrend shows no sign of slowing.andM;Historical Perspectives.andP;  A development of fundamental importance to computerusers over the past decade has been the evolution from centralized todecentralized computing.andP;  Many readers of this publication are no doubtthoroughly familiar with this subject, and have analyzed it from a number ofdifferent perspectives.andP;  But what is not often recognized is the profoundeffect this evolutionary trend has had on information security.andP;  In the early1970s, computer installations were usually centralized around a mainframethat did batch processing.andP;  Computer operators and programmers werespecialists who understood the arcane bits, bytes, and machine error codesused to run operations.andP;  Devices that punched and read cards and paper tapewere essential tools.andP;  Complex procedures were required to start up andmaintain systems.andM;Minicomputers, PCs, and workstations have led the revolution towarddecentralized computing.andP;  Moreover, computer networking has revolutionizedthe way we do business by allowing computer systems to be connected and toexchange information; we are now able to connect systems together andtransfer data thousands of miles across continents in a fraction of a second.andO;The objective of such decentralized systems and networks is to getdata-processing power into the hands of the people who need to use it:managers, engineers, scientists, office workers, and factory workers.andM;Accompanying decentralization are easier-to-use machines and applications.andO;No longer is it necessary to be a technical specialist to use computerequipment--and while this fact of computing life has its obvious advantages,it is not without costs in terms of vulnerability to breakdowns ininformation security.andP;  The computer may have revolutionized the way we live,but it has significantly complicated the task of ensuring security.andM;The Threat.andP;  Much--if not most--of the information transmitted throughdecentralized computer systems and networks must be protected againstunauthorized users who would read, write, lock, append, purge, or executeproprietary files.andP;  To understand this problem, we need to examine moreclosely the threat posed by unauthorized access.andM;Exponential growth in the use of decentralized computing systems hassharpened a double-edged technological sword: society is modernized, on theone hand, but at the same time new problems and new vulnerabilitiesassociated with this process come to the fore.andP;  Viruses, worms, Trojanhorses--methods by which computers are made to carry automated attacks onother computers--and hackers have added their names to our vocabulary andcomplicated computing advances.andM;Threats to information can take many forms, ranging from users &quot;accidentally&quot;purging or modifying files to sophisticated hackers or disgruntled employeesintentionally trying to modify or destroy data.andP;  What's more, a threat maynot necessarily involve access to or modification of data.andP;  As we depend moreand more on computers to perform essential tasks, a major concern thatdevelops is the possibility that an authorized user may be denied access to asystem.andP;  You need only consider the despair users feel when a computer goesdown in the middle of an urgent stock-market transaction, or in the middle ofthe monitoring of emergency services during a hurricane or other naturaldisaster, to get a sense for the importance of &quot;denial of service&quot; as itrelates to information security.andM;As a result of these and other threats to information security, numerouspieces of federal legislation have been passed to make it illegal forunauthorized individuals to tamper with files and/or computers in ways thatmay infringe on the legal rights of others.andM;In January 1988, the US Computer Security Act of 1987 was signed by thepresident.andP;  This law requires the National Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST, formerly the National Bureau of Standards) to establishsecurity requirements for all US government computer systems processing&quot;sensitive but unclassified&quot; material, including training programs for theirusers.andP;  Similar responsibilities for the protection of classsified data areborne by the National Security Agency (NSA).andM;Legislative action appears to have been the catalyst for a new-found alliancebetween these two agencies, which have fought countless turf battles over theyears.andP;  The Secure Data Network System (SDNS) Program, for example, is movingfrom NSA to NIST (although that portion having to do with data encryption isslated to stay under NSA control because it deals exclusively with theprotection of &quot;classified&quot; data).andM;Other legislation pending before Congress include a bill (HR 55) that wasintroduced in the House of Representatives in January 1989.andP;  If passed, itwill mandate stiff penalties for hackers (or others) who intentionallyintroduce viruses or worms to interfere with the operations of computers.andO;This proposal is commonly known as the Computer Virus Eradication Act of1989.andM;A Security Model.andP;  A better understanding of the complexity of the problemcan be gained by examining information security needs in terms of productrequirements.andP;  The two major factors that drive product security requirementsare security metrics and security policies.andM;Security metrics are the criteria used to assess security conditions.andO;Without metrics, the degree of security is merely a subjective value judgmentor opinion.andP;  An example of metrics being used in the US government is the&quot;Orange Book&quot; (officially known as the Trusted Computer System EvaluationCriteria, US Department of Defense document DoD 5200.28-STD, December 1985).andO;It lists 27 different criteria by which to measure security.andP;  Ratings areassigned to systems on the basis of the number of criteria they meet.andM;Security metrics and requirements are not limited to the United States alone.andO;The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in the United Kingdom has issued adraft document, Technical Criteria for Evaluation of Commercial SecurityProducts, that was produced by its Commercial Computer Security Centre.andO;Other governments are working on developing metrics of their own.andM;Security policies are statements of timeframes for meeting specific securitylevels or criteria.andP;  For example, DoD Directive 5200.28, dated March 1988,states that computers handling classified or sensitive unclassified datamust, at a minimum, meet the Orange Book's C-2 level of security by 1992.andO;The relationship between metrics and policies is outlined in Figure 2.andO;Combined, metrics and policies determine the security requirements for newproduct releases.andM;Note that requirements for information security are not limited togeographical boundaries or to types of computer users.andP;  The need to protectinformation extends to banks, financial institutions, insurance companies,government agencies (in both military and civilian departments), andhospitals.andP;  Basically, information security applies to any user who wants toprotect data from unauthorized access.andM;Requirements for information security can be better understood if they aredivided into two main categories: geographic location and user type.andO;Requirements for users operating within the US often differ from those forusers operating internationally.andP;  Commercial and government users (includingdefense contractors) can fall into either category.andP;  Figure 3 shows thismarket segmentation.andM;The most clearly defined quadrant in this segmentation scheme is the USgovernment--not because it necessarily has different needs, but because ithas taken a position of leadership in establishing metrics and issuing policystatements to implement them.andP;  The commercial quadrants promise to become themajor ones for security activity once metrics have been agreed upon andadopted as standards.andM;The requirements model for information security is the combination of Figures2 and 3 into the three-dimensional structure shown in Figure 4.andP;  Requirementsfor information security in a given market will become clearer after distinctconsideration is given to the metrics and policies within that market.andM;Standards.andP;  The separate development of information-security metrics andstandards in each market segment serves to complicate the straight-forwarddepiction contained in Figure 4 significantly.andP;  What is the relationshipbetween the metrics developed by one group and those being developed byanother group?andP;  Currently, the evaluation process used at the US NationalComputer Security Center (NCSS) in Maryland to assess operating systems takesbetween 12 and 24 months.andP;  Add to this process the evaluation of networks,databases, and applications, and a complex picture begins to take shape.andM;Are manufacturers and/or developers going to be required to evaluate theirproducts against more than one set of metrics?andP;  A requirement of thismagnitude would be prohibitively expensive for developers and, ultimately,consumers.andP;  Failure to agree on a common set of metrics for all customers(government and commercial, US and international) would inevitably fragmentthe market.andM;Commercial standards efforts are numerous and sporadic.andP;  Many groups--NCSC,the IEEE POSIX subcommittee, X/Open, NIST, and others--are working separatelyon security norms.andP;  Given this divided effort, it is not clear that anyunified set of metrics will evolve in the near future.andP;  It seems likely, infact, that dissension among the various metrics and standards committees willwork to the detriment of those customers who need security most.andM;Work aimed at developing security standards for UNIX is also very fragmented.andO;The ever-increasing popularity of UNIX in both commercial and governmentmarkets, together with the rapid growth rate in requirements for security,has turned secure UNIX standards into a political football.andP;  US governmentactivities include those sponsored by NCSC and NIST; in the commercial marketthere are efforts by IEEE's POSIX subcommittee, UniForum (formerly/usr/group), X/Open, and others.andP;  Of special interest too is the work of UNIXInternational and the Open Software Foundation.andM;Most user environments are made up of products supplied by many differentvendors.andP;  Yet as we have seen, the broader and truer need for computer usersis information security, not just operating-system or network security.andO;Agreement on information-security standards is an essential part of vendors'ability to provide users with the security they need for safeinteroperability in a multi-vendor environment.andM;Information-security requirements, as we have said, are not new.andP;  Moderntechnological advances, however, have complicated the problem by providingnew tools for creating, and gaining faster access to, more information thanever before.andP;  Threats to information security become more numerous as greaternumbers of systems and applications are developed and installed indistributed, decentralized computing environments and on easier-to-usesystems.andP;  But the general goal remains: information must be kept secure as itpasses from sender to receiver through whatever channels, interfaces, andproducts link them together.andM;Product requirements, we have asserted, are determined by a combination ofmetrics and policies.andP;  These requirements, metrics, and policies need to besegmented by market characteristic (user type and geographic location) if weare to better understand broader information-security requirements.andM;Congress is becoming more concerned with the growth of computer crime.andO;Legislation has already been passed, and more is pending, to inhibit would-beintruders and to provide for penalties that will deter violators.andP;  Theadoption of industry standards is the key to the success of theseinformation-security efforts.andP;  Current efforts are fragmented, with bothdomestic and international groups working in both the government andcommercial sectors.andP;  The definition and adoption of international standardsis crucial to providing interoperable, multivendor solutions that meet userrequirements for information security.andM;Jim Schindler has worked at Hewlett-Packard Co. for 14 years, the last six ofwhich he has spent dealing with information-security issues.andP;  At present heis the information security program manager in integrated informationmanagement and is responsible for coordinating the company's efforts to meetthe information security requirements of its customers.andP;  Schindler earned aBS in applied mathematics from California State Polytechnic University, andhas an MBA from the University of Santa Clara.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
