All 35 cases underwent correspondingconventional angiography including direct magnification angiography.In the cases with hypovascular tumors, IA-DSA was superior to conventionalangiography with/without subtraction in evaluating tumor blushes. Butconventional angiography was still necessary to evaluate tumor vessels.In the cases with hypervascular tumors, IA-DSA failed to show any diagnosticbenefit in our comparative study. The exposure dose in IA-DSA, one ofthe disadvantages, was still higher than in conventional angiography.At present, the primary method in diagnostic angiography may be stillconventional angiography rather than IA-DSA. IA-DSA may play importantand supplementary role mainly in the cases with hypovascular tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
