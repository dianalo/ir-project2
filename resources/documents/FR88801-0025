Background</ITAG>The GSA established, for the first time, a federal system for regulationof all government securities brokers and dealers. The Secretary of theTreasury (``Secretary'') is required by section 15C(b) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended by the GSA (15 U.S.C. 780-5(b)), to adoptrules and regulations concerning the financial responsibility, protectionof investor securities and balances, recordkeeping, reporting and auditof government securities brokers and dealers. The rules are designed toenhance the protection of investors in government securities while maintaininga fair, honest, and liquid market in such securities. Title II of the GSA(31 U.S.C. 3121(h); 9110) also requires the Secretary to adopt regulationsrelating to the custody of government securities held by depository institutions.Final regulations in response to this mandate were issued by the Departmenton July 24, 1987 (52 FR 27910).On March 15, 1988 (53 FR 8598), the Department proposed for comment severalminor technical changes to correct or clarify various parts of the regulations.Additionally, an amendment to andSection; 403.5(d), rescinding an exceptioncontained therein, was proposed to clarify the Department's intent thathold-in-custody repurchase transactions by financial institutions generallybe subject to the basic rules of this section. The comment period closedon April 27, 1988, after being extended (53 FR 12428) at the request ofan association representing a number of banks.Twenty-eight comment letters were received in response to the proposedamendments, all of which focused primarily on the andSection; 403.5(d) amendment.The majority of the commenters objected to the proposed amendment on treatmentof hold-in-custody repurchase transactions. The comments and the Department'sresponses are described more fully below, in the section-by-section analysis.After consideration of the comments and consultation with other appropriateregulatory agencies, the Department has decided to adopt the amendmentsas proposed; however, as noted in the Effective Dates section above andas more fully described in the Analysis Section below, the Department hasagreed to provide a limited extension of time for financial institutionsthat had been relying on the exception to the andSection; 403.5(d) requirementsto comply with certain requirements of andSection; 403.5(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Section-by-Section Analysis of Proposed Changes</ITAG>A. Part 400_Rules of General ApplicationIn Part 400, the Department proposed and is now adopting without changecertain amendments to andSection; 400.2, which deals with the filing andhandling of requests for exemption or interpretation and the submissionand handling of other materials. The specific amendments are describedbelow. The Department received only one specific comment on the changesin this part and that comment was supportive.<ITAG tagnum="81">Expediting Release of Non-Confidential Material; Treatment of ConfidentialMaterial</ITAG>The Department is amending portions of andSection; 400.2 relating to thesubmission of requests for interpretation, exemption, and classificationand the confidential treatment of such requests. The revised rule will:(1) Provide for expedited public availability of written responses to requestsfor interpretation, exemption, and classification, together with the incomingrequest, unless temporary confidential treatment is granted, and (2) clarifythe procedure for requesting confidential treatment of sensitive commercialand business information submitted to the Department in connection witha request for interpretation, exemption, or classification.To expedite public release of written responses to requests for interpretations,classifications and exemptions, together with the incoming request, a routine30-day hold on such material has been eliminated. Under the amended rule,the Department will make such requests and responses available to the publicfor inspection and copying as soon as practicable after the response isprovided to the requesting party, unless there has been a determinationto treat the response and incoming request as confidential. In accordancewith andSection; 400.2(c)(7)(ii), a party making a request for interpretation,exemption, or classification will be able to ask that the request and theDepartment's response be kept confidential for a maximum of 120 days. Itshould be noted that if, during those 120 days, the Department receivesa request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') (5 U.S.C.552) for disclosure of material granted temporary confidential treatmentunder this section, the determination to treat the material as confidentialwill be reevaluated in accordance with the Department's regulations fordisclosure of information under FOIA (31 CFR 1.6).The Department also recognizes that there are situations in which a partymay submit sensitive commercial or business information, in support ofa request for an interpretation, exemption, or classification, that theparty would want to keep confidential for a period of time in excess ofthe 120 days allowed for the Department's response and the incoming request.Section 400.2(c)(3)(iv) has been amended to provide procedures for makingrequests for such confidential treatment and to clarify that the Department'sregulations published at 31 CFR 1.6 will apply to such requests for confidentiality.The regulations set out in 31 CFR Part 1 contain the Department's proceduresunder FOIA and were amended on July 14, 1987 (52 FR 26302, 26311) to includea provision at 31 CFR 1.6 whereby the Department will notify submittersof potentially sensitive commercial or business information if the informationsubmitted is the subject of a FOIA request and will give the submitterof such information a chance to demonstrate why the information shouldbe kept confidential under section (b)(4) of FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).B. Part 402_Financial ResponsibilityIn Part 402, the Department proposed and is now adopting without changecertain amendments to andSection; 402.2, which states the capital rule ofregistered government securities brokers and dealers, and to andSection;402.2a (Appendix A), which provides a detailed description of the calculationof the market risk haircut required by andSection; 402.2. The specific amendmentsare described below. No comments were received on the proposed amendmentsto this part.<ITAG tagnum="81">Securities of International Organizations</ITAG>Subsequent to publication of the final regulations, the Department receivedquestions regarding the classification, for purposes of the computationof the capital requirements under andSection; 402.2, of certain securitiesissued by international organizations, such as the International Bank forReconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, theAfrican Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which have a statutoryexemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. 286k-1(a).)By adding a new category to the list of Treasury market risk instruments,the Department is clarifying the classification of such securities as Treasurymarket risk instruments pursuant to andSection; 402.2(e)(1). Only those securitiesissued by these international organizations whose changes in yield areclosely correlated with changes in yield of comparable Treasury securities,including STRIPS, would be included as Treasury market risk instruments.Any other securities issued by these entities would be included in theOther Securities Haircut, andSection; 402.2a(b). Futures and forwards onthose securities of international organizations that are Treasury marketrisk instruments would also be included as Treasury market risk instruments.<ITAG tagnum="81">Credit Volatility Haircut </ITAG>Section 402.2(g)(1)(iv) is being amended to clarify that futures and forwardson dollar-denominated time deposits that mature in 45 days or more andwhose changes in yield are closely correlated with marketable certificatesof deposit of no more than one year to maturity are included in the calculationof the credit volatility haircut. <ITAG tagnum="81">Changes to the Calculations and Instructions </ITAG>The Department is adopting conforming and clarifying revisions to the portionsof andSection; 402.2a addressing (1) the calculation of the market risk haircutand (2) the instructions to the schedules that may be used by governmentsecurities brokers or dealers in the calculation of the total haircutsas required by Part 402. Additionally, the changes include the correctionof certain descriptions in andSection; 402.2a, paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A), (a)(3)(i)(A)(<T3>1</T3>), (a)(3)(ii)(A) and (a)(3)(ii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>). The corrections clarify that futures and forwards that areTreasury market risk instruments should be included in the calculationsof the interim haircuts for long and short futures and forward positions.C. Part 403_Protection of Customer Securities and Balances In Part 403, the Department proposed and is now adopting without changecertain amendments to the following sections: andSection; 403.1, which dealswith the application of the part to registered brokers and dealers; andSection;403.4(e), which relates to the provisions for hold-in-custody repurchasetransactions effected by registered government securities brokers and dealers;andSection; 403.5 (d) and (f)(3), which contain provisions relating to financialinstitutions' handling of hold-in-custody repurchase transactions; andSection;403.5(e), which addresses the reserve requirements for government securitiesbrokers or dealers that are branches or agencies of a foreign bank; andandSection; 403.7, which specifies various effective dates for this part.The specific amendments are described below. Comments on this part relatedonly to the changes proposed for andSection; 403.5 (d) and (f)(3). Thesecomments and the Department's responses are discussed under the relatedheading below; the effective dates for compliance with andSection; 403.5(d)are discussed under that same heading.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conforming Changes </ITAG>The Department's final rules under the Government Securities Act, in andSection;403.4, required newly registered government securities brokers and dealersto comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'' or ``Commission'')customer protection rule (17 CFR 240.15c3-3, or ``Rule 15c3-3''), withcertain modifications. Compliance by registered brokers and dealers withvarious SEC rules, including Rule 15c3-3 as modified, was deemed to constitutecompliance with the Treasury rules with respect to the broker's or dealer'sgovernment securities activities. (See andSection; 403.1). At the time of adoption of the Department's final rules, the amendmentsto Rule 15c3-3 relating to the requirements applicable to hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions had not yet been adopted by the Commission in finalform. Thus, the Treasury rules, in andSection; 403.4(e), contained a newandSection; 15c3-3(b)(4), setting out the requirements applicable to suchtransactions. The Commission later adopted a virtually identical changeto Rule 15c3-3, which was issued as a final rule on August 14, 1987 (52FR 30331) and became effective on January 31, 1988.Consequently, the Department is now amending andSection; 403.4 to eliminatethe detailed rule language pertaining to hold-in-custody repurchase transactionsbecause these provisions are now incorporated in the Commission's rulethat the Department has adopted. Those minor differences that exist betweenthe Treasury rule on hold-in-custody repurchase transactions and the ruleadopted by the Commission have been retained in andSection; 403.4(e). Conforming changes relating to the amendment or Rule 15c3-3 are also beingmade in andSection;andSection; 403.1 and 403.7. These amendments do not inany way change the actual requirements for treatment of hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Applicability to Financial Institutions of andSection; 403.5(d) andEffective Dates_Requirements for Hold-in-Custody Repurchase Transactions</ITAG>Section 403.5(d) contains rules applicable to financial institutions thatengage in hold-in-custody repurchase transactions. These rules essentiallyparallel the requirements adopted in andSection;andSection; 403.1 and 403.4for non-financial institution brokers and dealers. All of the rules providethat the repurchase agreement must be obtained in writing; specify certaindisclosures that must be included in the agreement; require confirmationof the specific securities that are the subject of a hold-in-custody repurchasetransaction by the end of the day on which a transaction is initiated andon any day on which substitution of securities occurs; and specify possessionor control requirements.Section 403.5(d), as it appeared in the final GSA regulations, differedfrom andSection; 403.4 in one respect. It contained a provision whereby afinancial institution was exempt from the provisions of andSection; 403.5(d)if it did not retain the right to substitute securities that are the subjectof a repurchase transaction and it delivered the subject securities tothe separate control of the safekeeping department. (For this purpose,certain criteria for safekeeping were also set out in andSection; 403.5(f)(3).)The Department had intended that the safekeeping exception have limitedapplicability, and that therefore nearly all hold-in-custody repurchasetransactions would be subject to the same rules. Because it became apparentthat the safekeeping exception had broader potential applicability thanwas originally intended, the Department proposed its rescission. As notedin the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department concluded that broaderuse of the exception to avoid the requirements applicable to hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions was not consistent with the mandate of the GSAto improve investor protection. Moreover, it did not appear possible tonarrow the scope of the exception in a way that would sufficiently limitits applicability.All of the twenty-eight comment letters received addressed the proposedamendments relating to the rescission of the safekeeping exception. Onecommenter, a registered broker-dealer, supported the amendment on the basisthat all investors in hold-in-custody repurchase transactions should receivethe same protections. This commenter emphasized in particular the importanceof the confirmation requirement for investor protection. Twenty-seven commenters,representing financial institutions, opposed the amendments for varyingreasons. Most of these commenters expressed the view that safekeeping providedsufficient protection for their counterparties and, more specifically,objected to compliance with one or more of the requirements for hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions to which they would be subject if the exceptionwere eliminated.Four commenters objected to the proposed amendment specifically becauseit would require them to obtain executed written agreements with theircounterparties before entering into hold-in-custody repurchase transactions.Two of these commenters felt that the requirement would place financialinstitutions at a competitive disadvantage to registered broker-dealersand based this argument on an analogy between a hold-in-custody repurchasetransaction by a financial institution and a repurchase transaction bya broker-dealer that delivers out the securities to a customer's accountat another institution. As noted, the regulations do not require a writtenagreement for a deliver-out repurchase transaction. Another commenter mistakenlybelieved that financial institutions not required to give notice of beinggovernment securities dealers are also not required to comply with theprovisions of andSection; 403.5(d) for hold-in-custody repurchase transactions;on this erroneous assumption, the commenter stated that financial institutionsthat are noticed government securities dealers would be placed at a competitivedisadvantage by being subject to the requirement in andSection; 403.5(d)to obtain written repurchase agreements with their customers. Finally,one commenter objected to requiring a written agreement if a bank doesnot retain a right of substitution. This objection appeared to be basedon a concern that an investor would have a difficult time assessing thecomparative risks between institutions that retain a right of substitutionof securities and those that do not, if all financial institutions arerequired to obtain written agreements.Nineteen commenters opposed the amendments primarily because of the impactthat the confirmation requirements in andSection; 403.5(d) would have oncertain cash management programs involving what are commonly referred toas sweep repurchase transactions. In a sweep repurchase transaction, excessfunds are swept from a customer's deposit account for overnight investmentin a repurchase transaction. Since sweep repurchase transactions are recurringtransactions, generally giving rise to a new repurchase transaction daily,the provisions of andSection; 403.5(d) would require the issuance of a confirmationeach day.These commenters generally objected to the daily confirmation for sweeprepurchase transactions because of the associated costs and a belief thatthe daily confirmations would not significantly enhance customer protection.A number of these commenters expressed the view that their customers wouldprefer to rely solely on a monthly statement detailing all of the transactionsfor the period. One other commenter, focusing primarily on the requirementfor confirmation when substitution of securities takes place, felt thatthe safekeeping exception should be expanded, so that a financial institutionthat limits substitution to maturing securities would not be required toconfirm the new securities. Finally, one additional commenter, who didnot object to the general requirement to confirm securities in a repurchasetransaction, opposed the requirement to place the market value of the securitieson the confirmation.A few commenters objected to the rescission of the safekeeping exceptionon the basis that compliance generally with the requirements of andSection;403.5(d) would be unnecessarily burdensome and would not give recognitionto legal protections afforded by the safekeeping services offered by financialinstitutions. Finally, one commenter, who did not object to the requirementsof andSection; 403.5(d), indicated that it was important to preserve in theregulations the concept of independent safekeeping, a function that thecommenter asserted is offered by only a few financial institutions.While most of the commenters generally recommended retaining the safekeepingexception, a number of other recommendations were also made. One commenterconcerned with the written agreement requirement of andSection; 403.5(d)proposed that the requirement be amended to allow execution of the writtenagreement within 10 days after initiation of the first repurchase transactionwith a counterparty. Another commenter recommended limiting the use ofthe safekeeping exception by requiring that securities maintained throughan account at a Federal Reserve Bank be transferred to a separate accountat the Federal Reserve that would be under the control of the safekeepingdepartment. This commenter also noted that this recommendation would probablynot be practical for those financial institutions concerned with sweeprepurchase transactions.A number of commenters supported a proposal put forth previously by theBank Capital Markets Association (BCMA) specifically in connection withsweep repurchase transactions. This proposal was premised on delivery ofthe securities of safekeeping, obtaining a written repurchase agreement,issuance of a monthly statement to the customer that contained the detailedconfirmation data for each transaction, and a request that Treasury interpretthat the confirmation requirements of Part 450 would not require the issuanceof a separate confirmation for each sweep transaction. The BCMA and AmericanBankers Association also recommended an alternative proposal, if Treasuryultimately determined to rescind the safekeeping exception. This proposal,which was supported by several commenters but viewed as unworkable andequally costly by another commenter, recommended that andSection; 403.5(d)be amended to provide that, for purposes of confirming sweep transactions,financial institutions be permitted to confirm transactions on a dailybasis by electronic transfer of the confirmation data to an unaffiliatedthird-party custodian with whom the bank would contract to serve as a depositoryfor the information. Under this scenario, it was stated that the customerwould have the option, to be exercised affirmatively in the written agreement,to receive daily confirmations directly or to designate the third-partycustodian as depository of the daily information. Additionally, the customerswould be sent a monthly statement that would include the details of thedaily sweep activities for the month. This proposal was viewed as satisfyingany potential need to identify a customer's interests in specific securitiesin the event a financial institution is placed in liquidation and a bankingregulator is unable to identify such information from the books and recordsof the bank. Two of the commenters expressed the belief that permitting financial institutionsto issue monthly confirmations for sweep repurchase transactions wouldbe analogous to the provisions of SEC Rule 10b-10 (b) and (c) (17 CFR 240.10b-10),which permit brokers-dealers effecting certain types of transactions, forexample purchases and sales of certain mutual fund shares, to send monthlystatements to customers, in lieu of a confirmation for each transaction.One commenter suggested that a confirmation be required on substitutionsonly when the type of security changed, for example, substitution of aTreasury security with a GNMA security.Two comments were received in connection with the Department's proposalto make the amendments effective 30 days after publication in final formin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>One commenter noted generally that more timewould be needed but offered no specific alternative proposal; another commentersuggested that 120 days would be needed to permit financial institutionsrelying on the safekeeping exception to make necessary changes to complywith the requirements of andSection; 403.5(d).The Department has given careful consideration to the comment letters.With respect to all the comments on the requirements applicable to hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions in general, it should be noted that the Departmentconsidered at length in the promulgation of the GSA regulations whetherthese requirements are appropriate measures for customer protection beforefinally adopting them. However, to the extent that these issues were raisedagain in the context of the proposed rescission of the safekeeping exception,the Department has reviewed these requirements in terms of the specificcomments submitted, as discussed below.On the issue of written agreements, the Department views the written repurchaseagreement as a sound business practice for any type of repurchase transactionand as a fundamental tool for strengthening customer protection, particularlyfor hold-in-custody repurchase transactions. The Department notes thatthere continues to be legal uncertainties surrounding the characterizationof repurchase transactions and that problems that have arisen in connectionwith repurchase transactions have more frequently involved hold-in-custodytype of repurchase transactions. Hold-in-custody repurchase transactions,by their nature, contain an element of additional risk for the investor,in that the investor's counterparty is serving simultaneously throughoutthe transaction not only as principal in the transaction, but also as theinvestor's custodial agent. The Department believes that a written agreement,with appropriate disclosures, is important to advise the investor of risksthat may be associated with these transactions, to clarify the intendednature of the transactions undertaken between the counterparties, and todocument the obligations agreed to by each counterparty.Given the somewhat unique nature of these hold-in-custody repurchase transactions,the specific legislative concern with them when the GSA was enacted, andthe benefits to be derived from written agreements covering these transactions,the Department has decided to rescind the safekeeping exception in andSection;403.5(d) and, by this amendment, clearly establish a uniform requirementfor the execution of a written repurchase agreement as a condition forengaging in hold-in-custody repurchase transactions with customers. Itis noted that the majority of those commenting on the March 15 proposedamendments, as well as those commenting on the GSA regulations as theywere being developed, either did not object to or specifically endorsedthe requirement for a written agreement. The Department does not agree with the suggestions of some of the commentersthat, because a financial institution may have an existing custody relationshipwith a customer, this relationship negates the need for establishing inwriting the terms and conditions of hold-in-custody repurchase transactionswith that customer. The Department also does not agree that the establishmentof a uniform requirement for written agreements provides an advantage toregistered broker-dealers or to financial institutions that are not requiredto give notice of being government securities dealers, since all of theseentities are subject to the same requirements for hold-in-custody repurchasetransactions. Finally, in response to the comment that investors will notbe able to assess the relative risks of certain repurchase agreements ifall financial institutions are required to obtain a written agreement,whether or not the institutions retain the right of substitution, the Departmentbelieves that this comment is based on an erroneous assumption that a financialinstitution that does not seek to obtain a right of substitution neverthelessmust include the disclosure language regarding substitutions in its writtenagreement.With respect to confirmation requirements, the Department has concluded,after consideration of the comments, that all hold-in-custody repurchasetransactions should be subject to the same confirmation requirements, thosethat are set out in andSection; 403.5(d) or the parallel requirements adoptedin andSection;andSection; 403.1 and 403.4. The Department believes, as a generalprinciple, that securities transactions should be confirmed promptly andhas decided that such treatment is particularly appropriate for hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions, even when the subject securities are deliveredto a separate safekeeping department within the financial institution.The Department also does not believe that the frequency or short durationof certain repurchase transactions obviates the benefits to a counterpartyof receiving prompt confirmation of each such transaction. In this context,it is noted that Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code assigns significantvalue to a confirmation in establishing a customer's interest in securities.As discussed above, the entity acting as counterparty to an investor ina hold-in-custody repurchase transaction is also acting as custodial agent,with responsibility for evidencing the customer's interests in the specificsecurities that are the subject of the transaction. The Department believesthat the prompt issuance of confirmations, which should be a by-productof the process for recording an investor's interests in particular securities,serves to reinforce the obligation of the custodian/counterparty to recordsuch interests promptly and completely.Apart from the legal ramifications, prompt confirmation also benefits thecustomer significantly by providing information with which to act or reactknowledgeably and promptly in current and future transactions with a givencounterparty. Until confirmation is received, a counterparty may have noknowledge of the specific securities that are the subject of the repurchasetransaction. This information is important not only from the standpointof a customer's ability to identify securities should the customer needto initiate a claim; prompt confirmation also enables the customer to monitorthe sufficiency and appropriateness of the securities provided by the counterparty.While not all customers may utilize this information fully or on a timelybasis, the Department believes that investors should be encouraged to doso and, in support of that goal, should be provided with the necessarytools.With respect to an alternative proposed by several commenters, wherebydaily confirmation data would be routinely sent to a third-party depositoryselected by the counterparty-financial institution, the Department believesthat approval of such an arrangement, as an alternative to immediate confirmation,would convey an inappropriate message to investors that this arrangementis a satisfactory substitute for continual and careful monitoring of investors'hold-in-custody repurchase transactions. The Department also does not viewthis alternative as satisfying all of the customer protection purposesfor which the confirmation requirement is intended, even though the proposedarrangement also contemplates sending a detailed monthly statement to theinvestor. As noted above, an important aspect of the confirmation is toprovide investors with sufficient information to be able to act knowledgeablyand promptly with respect to their transactions. It cannot reasonably beexpected that, in the proposal described, the third party recipient ofthe confirmation data would have any knowledge of a particular transactionor the terms of the underlying agreement. In fact, the third-party recipientwould not even know whether it was due to receive confirmation data ona particular day for a particular customer, in order to verify independentlythat it had in fact received all appropriate data. The Department notesthat such an arrangement is markedly different from what is normally referredto as a tri-party repurchase agreement, in which an independent institutionagrees to serve as agent for the two counterparties to the transaction,in which the agent is involved in effecting the transfer of funds and securitiesbetween the two counterparties and assumes certain responsibilities withrespect to safeguarding the interests of both counterparties.The Department recognizes that meeting the confirmation requirements ofandSection; 403.5(d) may entail additional costs for some institutions butalso believes that some cost increase is a necessary and expected outcomeof the legislative requirements to establish regulations for governmentsecurities transactions and, in particular, for repurchase transactions.The data received by the Department on confirmation costs was inconclusive.Only three financial institutions provided estimated annual costs in connectionwith issuing confirmations for sweep repurchase transactions and theseestimates varied widely for similar volumes of transactions. Based on conversationswith a number of financial institutions that offer sweep repurchase programs,the Department is aware that some financial institutions are currentlyconfirming such transactions daily. Also, as noted by one of the commenters,broker-dealers that are not financial institutions have developed workablesystems to comply with the confirmation requirements for short-term repurchasetransactions.The Department does not agree with the point raised by two commenters thatsweep repurchase transactions are analogous to certain mutual fund transactionsand that monthly confirmations should be permitted for sweep transactions,since similar treatment is permitted, under SEC Rule 10b-10 for those mutualfund transactions. The exceptions provided in the SEC rule are limitedto certain types of transactions in which the broker-dealer is acting solelyas agent for its customer, rather than in the dual capacity involved inhold-in-custody repurchase transactions, and in cases where the brokergenerally does not have custody of the securities. Additionally, the mutualfunds referred to are subject to a separate and extensive regulatory scheme,under the Investment Company Act of 1940, that addresses the operationsof such companies and the protection of customer investments in such funds.The Department has previously addressed at considerable length in the preamblesto the temporary and final GSA rules (52 FR 19642, May 26, 1987; 52 FR27910, July 24, 1987) why it believes that confirmations should describethe specific securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions.For those reasons, the Department does not believe it is appropriate toadopt various suggestions by three commenters that (1) confirmations berequired only when the general type of security changes upon substitution;(2) that confirmation not be required when substitution occurs only asa result of securities maturing; and (3) that the market value not be requiredon confirmations.With regard to the comments that, by eliminating the safekeeping exception,the regulations do not give appropriate recognition to the merits of safekeepingby a financial institution, the Department believes, as stated above, thatthe unique characteristics of a hold-in-custody repurchase transaction,in which a financial institution is acting simultaneously throughout thetransaction in the dual and potentially conflicting capacities of bothprincipal and agent, warrant compliance with the requirements for hold-in-custodyrepurchase transactions, in addition to compliance with the requirementsof Part 450. The provisions of Part 450 have as their basis, elements thatare inherent to duties of a safekeeping or custodial agent: that the financialinstitution hold the securities separate from the institution's own securities;keep the customers' securities free from lien, charge or claim of thirdparties; and clearly record the customers' interests in the specific securities.It is noted that these same obligations are part of the possession or controlrequirements placed on broker-dealers that are not financial institutions.For all of the reasons stated above, the Department has decided to adoptthe amendments, as proposed, to rescind the safekeeping exception and subjectall hold-in-custody repurchase transactions conducted by any financialinstitution with a customer to the requirements contained in andSection;403.5(d). In recognition that a number of financial institutions, in relianceon the safekeeping exception, are not issuing confirmations in accordancewith the timeframes prescribed in andSection; 403.5(d)(1)(ii), the Departmentis providing until December 1, 1988 for such financial institutions tocomply fully with these timing requirements, provided that the institutionis, in the interim, issuing confirmation of the specific securities associatedwith each transaction no less frequently than monthly. For those financialinstitutions that have not been obtaining written repurchase agreementsin reliance on the safekeeping exception, the Department is providing untilSeptember 1, 1988 to comply with the written agreement requirements inandSection; 403.5(d)(1) for transactions entered into on or after that date,unless the transaction is with an existing customer. For transactions withexisting customers (one with whom the financial institution has engagedin a repurchase transaction on or after September 1, 1987 and before September1, 1988), these financial institutions have until December 1, 1988 to complywith the written agreement requirements. Financial institutions that arecurrently complying with any or all of the requirements of andSection; 403.5(d),as amended, must continue to do so.<ITAG tagnum="81">Foreign Branches and Agencies_Reserve Requirements</ITAG>Section 403.5(e) of the regulations provides that a government securitiesbroker or dealer that is a branch or agency of a foreign bank is subjectto a modified version of the reserve requirement applicable to non-bankbrokers and dealers. A foreign branch or agency subject to the rule mustkeep on deposit with a bank (as that term is defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(h))an amount computed in accordance with the modified version of the reserveformula. As stated in the preamble to the temporary regulations (52 FR19648, May 26, 1987), this requirement was meant to provide a degree ofassurance to securities customers to whom the foreign branch or agencyowes money, by requiring that such funds be available in the United Statesin the event of a failure. Inadvertently, the final regulations did notinclude instructions concerning the timing and frequency of the computationof the amount of the deposit, the timing of the deposit, and recordkeepingon the computations.To correct this omission, the Department is now amending andSection; 403.5(e)by adding new paragraphs (e)(5) and (e)(6). Paragraph (e)(5) requires thatthe computation be made weekly as of the close of the last business dayof the week and that the deposit so computed by made no later than onehour after the opening of banking business on the second following businessday. Paragraph (e)(6) requires that the foreign branch and agency madeand maintain a record of each computation and that these records be preservedfor three years, the first two years of which the records must be maintainedin an easily accessible place.<ITAG tagnum="81">Effective Dates_Technical Amendments</ITAG>Section 403.7 contains effective dates for various provisions of Part 403.In andSection; 403.7(b), (c), (d) and (e), references to andSection; 403.4(e)have been changed to refer more generally to andSection; 403.4 to conformto the modifications to andSection; 403.4(e) discussed above. Additionally,the introductory language in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) has been modifiedto make clear that the interim disclosures addressed in andSection; 403.7(d)were to be used on a one-time basis only until such time as the originalrequirement for obtaining a written agreement, with the disclosures requiredunder andSection;andSection; 403.4 or 403.5(d), became effective. With therequirement for a written agreement in effect, hold-in-custody repurchasetransactions may not be entered into with a counterparty until such writtenagreement is obtained from the counterparty.The effective dates for the rescission of the safekeeping exception fromandSection; 403.5 were addressed separately in the ``Effective Dates'' sectionat the front of this document and in the preamble discussion of andSection;403.5 and are not being reflected again as amendments to andSection; 403.7.D. Part 404_Recordkeeping and Record PreservationIn Part 404, two minor corrections are being made in andSection; 404.4, whichcontains recordkeeping requirements for government securities brokers anddealers that are financial institutions. No comments were received on thesechanges. The changes involved are as follows: in andSection; 404.4(a)(2),a reference to andSection; 450.4 (c), (d)(3) and (f) is being corrected torefer to andSection; 450.4 (c), (d) and (f); in andSection; 404.4(a)(3), areference to a physical count of securities is being modified to deletethe word ``physical'', as the count includes book-entry securities as well.E. Part 450_Custodial Holdings of Government Securities by Depository InstitutionsIn Part 450, the Department proposed and is now adopting without changean amendment to andSection; 450.1(b) to clarify that the procedure describedfor requesting and giving interpretations of the regulations describedin andSection; 400.2 is also applicable to interpretations of Part 450. Nocomments were received on this amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Special Analyses</ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed regulation, the Department concluded thatthese amendments did not constitute a major regulation under the criteriastated in Executive Order 12291. The Departmant also certified that theseamendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Accordingly, the Department concluded that neithera regulatory impact analysis nor a regulatory flexibility analysis wasrequired. After consideration of the comments on the proposed rule, theDepartment does not believe that there exists any reason to alter eitherits conclusion that the amendments to the regulations do not constitutea major rule under Executive Order 12291 or its certification that theamendments to the regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.The collection of the information requirement contained in andSection; 403.5(e)of this final regulation has been reviewed and approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1505-0108. The estimatedannual burden associated with the collection of information in andSection;403.5(e) is 250 hours per recordkeeper. Comments concerning the accuracyof this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden shouldbe directed to the Bureau of the Public Debt, Government Securities RegulationsStaff, Room 209, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20239-0001 and to theOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for Department ofthe Treasury.Because the amendments to Parts 402, 403.1, 403.4, 403.7, 404 and 450 aretechnical, non-substantive amendments designed to clarify the regulationsas originally adopted and the amendment to Part 400 will provide for earlierpublic availability of certain information, the Department finds that goodcause exists, with respect to these amendments, to dispense with the delayedeffective date provision in 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>17 CFR Part 400 Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, banking, Brokers, Governmentsecurities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.17 CFR Part 402 Brokers, Government securities.17 CFR Part 403Banks, banking, Brokers, Government securities.17 CFR Part 404Banks, banking, Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.17 CFR Part 450Banks, banking, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.For the reasons set out in the Preamble, the Department is amending 17CFR Parts 400, 402, 403, 404, and 450 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 400_RULES OF GENERAL APPLICATION</ITAG>1.
