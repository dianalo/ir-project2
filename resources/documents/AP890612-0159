Environmentalists praised his effort but said he should gofurther. The coal industry said he was trying ``too much too soon.''   To curb smog-producing ozone, Bush recommended that automakers berequired to build and sell methanol-powered cars in nine urban areasplagued by dirty air. And he recommended that limits on tailpipeemissions of ozone-producing hydrocarbons in existing cars betightened by almost 40 percent.   Bush also proposed a 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxideemissions from coal-burning power plants, a major cause of acidrain. If achieved, that would be a 50 percent cut.   Moreover, he said industry should be required to use newtechnology to curb the release of cancer-causing toxic chemicalsinto the air.   Bush outlined his legislative package at the White House in aspeech to members of Congress, governors, and industry andenvironmental groups.   Later, keeping the focus on the environment, he flew toYellowstone National Park in Wyoming for a first-hand look at damagefrom the fires that blackened nearly half of the park's 2.2 millionacres last year. On Tuesday, he will make environmental speechesnear Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in Lincoln, Neb.   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said cleaning the air ``willneither be free nor easy.''   The White House said the post-1995 cost of the acid rain programwould be about $3.8 billion a year, or a bit more than 2 percent ofthe nation's current electric bills.   To customers of the affected plants, rate increase could begreater. On Board Air Force One, White Houes Chief of Staff JohnSununu said ratepayers in the affected states could expect increasesof 5 percent to 10 percent.   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste told a news conference in Columbusratepayers in his state faced ``double-digit'' increases.   At a briefing before Bush's speech, William Reilly, head of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, estimated the overall program wouldcost between $14 billion and $19 billion a year after it is in fulleffect at the turn of the century.   Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, saidBush's plan had strong provisions for dealing with acid rain.However, in the area of urban smog, he said he was concerned thatnot enough was being proposed to deal with pollution from existinggasoline-powered cars.   ``Our concern is that he places a lot of reliance on new kinds offuel,'' Ayres said. ``I think he got an A for effort. He's headingin the right direction.''   In Canada, which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowingin from the United States, Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard saidat a news conference, ``I am advised the controls ... would satisfyCanada's request for a 50 percent reduction in acid rain reachingthis country.'' He said Canada still hopes for a treaty to make thenew controls harder to weaken.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the Bush proposal was the mostpositive move by the United States in a decade of Canadiancomplaints and requests for action.   Brooks B. Yeager, an Audubon Society official, said, ``We mayquarrel with some of the details but it's certainly a major stepforward.'' Yeager and other environmentalists said Bush was notgoing far enough to control toxic poisons and other pollutants thatare severe public health threats.   On the other hand, the president of the National CoalAssociation, Richard L. Lawson, said Bush was ``seeking toaccomplish too much too soon.''   ``Unfortunately, some of the provisions unveiled today areunnecessary, unduly harsh and economically onerous,'' he said in astatement. ``If enacted, they threaten to smother the economy andstifle American competitiveness.''   In his speech, Bush said the nation has made progress towardclean air over the past 10 years but ``we have not come far enough.''   ``Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and politicalparalysis has plagued further progress against air pollution,'' hesaid.   Bush said, ``We've seen enough of this stalemate. It's time toclear the air.''   Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, who has waged a doggedcampaign to clean up the environment in his state, said, ``This ismuch further than I honestly expected the president to go.''   Bush's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, did not try to tighten cleanair laws. The last overhaul of the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act wasin 1977.   Bush said that dozens of cities currently do not meet federalair-quality standards.   Reilly ,head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said theproposal is ``going to solve that problem by the year 2000 for allbut two or three cities.'' And Bush said that within 20 years, bythe year 2010, ``even Los Angeles, Houston and New York will beexpected to make it.''   Bush urged Congress to require automakers to phase in productionof cars that use alternate fuels such as methanol. By 1995, theautomakers would be required to sell 500,000 such cars in areas withthe worst smog. By 1997, the required number of cars would be 1million.   That effort would focus on nine urban areas: New York, LosAngeles, Houston, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego,Chicago and metropolitan areas of Connecticut.   Unlike gasoline, methanol does not produce the hydrocarbons andnitrogen oxides that are an ingredient in the ozone that causes thesevere smog problems that have made the air unhealthful in manymetropolitan areas.   In an attempt to curb the release of toxic chemicals fromindustrial plants, Bush proposed requiring industry to use the bestavailable technology to curb such pollution. The plan anticipates``near term'' reductions in airborne toxic chemicals, including manythat are cancer causing, of between 75 and 90 percent.   The proposal to combat acid rain calls for half of the10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide to be achieved by 1995.The proposal would allow utilities that exceed the requiredreductions to accumulate credits that would be sold or traded toother utilities that are unable to reach the reduction targets.   About 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide gas are released annuallyinto the air, most from power plants that burn high-sulfur coal. Thegas turns into sulfates, combines with moisture and falls in rain orsnow, often hundreds of miles away.   Scientists have blamed acid rain for causing substantial damageto lakes, forests and aquatic life, especially in the Northeast andCanada as a result of pollutants released from power plants in theOhio Valley and industrial Midwest.</TEXT></DOC>
