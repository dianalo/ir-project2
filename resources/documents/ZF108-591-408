Deusdade, atraining technician at Broosk Air Force Base, Texas.andP;  &quot;Overall, itout-performs the others and is more Lotus-compatible than its nearest rival,[Informix Software Inc.'s] Smart.andP;  Quattro Pro's ability to read dBase filesdirectly without translation is a real plus since I maintain a dBase budgetdatabase.andP;  Lotus Version 3 is too memory-hungry.andP;  I was fortunate to getQuattro Pro, which beats it hands down.&quot;andM;Although the Smart spreadsheet was included in this survey, it did notreceive enough responses to appear in final results.andM;Excel, also used by about 20 percent of respondents, came in a strong butdistant second behind Quattro.andP;  A comparison of thetwo surveys shows that apreference for Excel also is growing, although Quattro clearly overshadowsit.andM;Excel users rated it second in every category in this survey, and equal ornerly equal to third-place Lotus 1-2-3 in documentation, file compatibility,speed, memory use and macro capability.andM;Paul Lichtenstein, a readiness assistant with the Navy's 5th Submarine Groupin San Diego, said, &quot;Excel has a good blend of power and presentationfeatures.andP;  It is easy to use and has a good macro language and great outputabilities.&quot;andM;As before, comments about Lotus 1-2-3 spanned the spectrum.andP;  One reder called1-2-3 &quot;too expensive for what it offers.andP;  Lotus is using its market dominanceto keep its prices high.andP;  Quattro Professional is a far better alternative.andO;It has minimum hardware requirements but will take advantage of the hardwareyou have.andP;  Documentation is good, mouse support is nice and graphics aregreat.andP;  It is by far the better deal.&quot;andM;On the other hand, another reader said, &quot;Lotus 1-2-3 is used almostexclusively at my office.andP;  For the money, I have found no betterspreadsheet.&quot;andM;About 20 percent of those surveyed said they use fourth-place SuperCalc fromComputer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y.andP;  One calledSuperCalc &quot;old but reliable.&quot;andP;  A SuperCalc 5 user said it is &quot;an excellentproduct and Computer Associates provides very good support.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
