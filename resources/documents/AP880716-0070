The PRI failed to gauge the depth of discontent brewing in adevastated economy, and it underestimated an increasinglysophisticated nation.   Spoiled and overconfident after years of unchallenged rule andlandslide victories _ allegedly padded by fraud _ the PRI was puton the spot in the July 6 elections.   Mexicans used their votes to deliver a sharp kick to the partyshins.   They gave PRI's presidential candidate, Carlos Salinas deGortari, the smallest margin of victory in party history _ justover 50 percent _ and forced PRI to give up Senate seats for thefirst time.   The PRI, which has never lost a presidential, gubernatorial orsenate race since it was founded in 1929, suffered unprecedentedlosses in Congress, although it kept control of both houses.   With four Senate seats, however, the leftist opposition now hasa guaranteed forum for the next six years. And both the right andthe left will have a greater voice in the lower house.   The PRI, although it came out of the elections bruised anddivided, is clearly still running Mexico. Salinas takes office Dec.1.   Future elections will reveal the strength, shape and stayingpower of the opposition.   The PRI was created by survivors of the 1910-1921 revolution,who vowed to bring stability and social and economic justice toMexico. But while Mexico changed radically over the decades, thePRI didn't keep up.   After World War II, Mexico entered a period of unparalleleddevelopment. Industries, the recently nationalized oil fields andpetrochemical production expanded. Tourism flourished. The economygrew 5 percent to 6 percent every year from the early 1960s to 1980.   Only one out of four Mexicans could read and write in 1940. Noweight out 10 are literate. Forty years ago, almost three-quartersof the people lived in the countryside. About 60 percent are nowcity dwellers.   Mexico City has become the largest metropolitan area in theworld. The city that was home to 3.1 million people in 1950 grew tonearly 20 million _ almost a quarter of the nation's estimated 85million people.   Sustained post-war progress and the oil boom of the 1970screated a growing middle class based on the American model.   The PRI, however, remained a party of power-hungry peasants,laborers and bureaucrats, an institution run by the sons andgrandsons of its founders.   The oil boom triggered a wild government spending-and-borrowingspree and high-level corruption.   When oil prices fell in 1982, the economy came unraveled.   Since then, the average Mexican's spending power has been cut inhalf. Last year, inflation hit a record 159.2 percent.   Now, it takes a full day's minimum wage to buy two pounds ofmeat. Many families go without.   The bust left a society of frustrated consumers watching withenvy as television families in trendy clothes enjoy the latestproducts, which are out of reach of most Mexicans.   The public ire grew this year under an economic austerityprogram that enabled Mexico to keep up payments on its $104 billionforeign debt but further eroded Mexicans' buying power.   The PRI began realizing it was in trouble as the electionapproached, but it underestimated how many people would voteagainst the system.   When returns began coming in, stunned party insiders realizedthe PRI had lost Mexico City to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidateof a leftist coalition, who talked about social compassion,national pride and a moratorium on debt payments.   Cardenas and the rightist opposition candidate, Manuel J.Clouthier of the National Action Party, or PAN, took almost halfthe vote _ even though results may have been distorted by fraud.   The election left Salinas, the architect of the economicausterity plan, without a solid mandate for change.   Throughout the campaign, Salinas insisted he wanted an honestvictory that would give him an undisputed green light to modernizethe party and the economy.   Instead, his victory was not clean enough or big enough tosilence either the party's traditional faction or the public voicesof economic discontent.   ``He has a party in shambles, he has no program left, he has noconstituency. All he has is a presidency _ and an empty one atthat,'' said Adolfo Aguilar, a Mexican political analyst andCarnegie Endowment fellow.   Salinas will have to tread carefully among his plans tochallenge the bloated bureaucracy, the corrupt unions, the blatantpatronage system, the political bosses and the privileged elite hehas inherited.   His closest associates say privately that the outcome of thevote was more credible than in previous Mexican elections, when thePRI won with huge majorities.   They also say the sobering result _ a message from theelectorate that the old ways simply are no longer acceptable _gives them the mandate to unleash reform within the party.   The strong opposition showing could force Salinas to fashioneconomic policies with an eye to the social consequences, and totheir impact on ordinary people.   ``I think the opposition's fate rests on Cardenas,'' Aguilarsaid. ``He has to make people believe that the election wasworthwhile, even if he lost. If Cardenas fails to lead, the PRIwill regain its old confidence.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Candice Hughes, who used to cover the UnitedNations, has recently been assigned as a correspondent in MexicoCity.</TEXT></DOC>
