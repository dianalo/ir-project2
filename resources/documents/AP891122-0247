Keating Jr., and his family,accused of stealing millions of dollars from his failed savings andloan, have large sums of money in bank accounts and companiesabroad, according to court papers and congressional testimony.   Keating, the head of American Continental Corp., the Phoenixholding company that owned the Lincoln Savings and LoanAssociation, still holds accounts in London, Paris and at leastthree cities in Switzerland, Geneva, Zurich and Lausanne, courtpapers say.   In one case, Keating channeled more than $10 million in Lincolnfunds to the Panama-based Southbrook Holding Co., which federalexaminers said was owned by American Continental.   ``It doesn't surprise me that Mr. Keating finally found Gen.Manual Antonio Noriega because that's one reason Noriega has beenable to survive ... You have a tremendous volume of bank, corporatemonies there,'' House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez,D-Texas, said at a recent hearing.   The failure of Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion,making it the nation's costliest savings and loan failure.   Keating's dealings overseas were detailed in a class actionlawsuit filed in Los Angeles this week on behalf of thousands ofpeople who bought $250 million in worthless junk bonds issued byAmerican Continental.   Keating, who still earns $400,000 annually as the chairman ofthe bankrupt American Continental, denies wrongdoing in the Lincolncase. He claims he is the victim of harassment by the federalgovernment.   Other information came out at a hearing on Irvine, Calif.,-basedLincoln before the House Banking Committee.   Joseph W. Cotchett, an attorney in Burlingame, Calif., whorepresents bond holders, alleged in court papers that ``Keating andhis immediate family received well over $34 million of Lincolnmoney for their own personal use.''   Keating and his wife, Mary Elaine, also used the AmericanContinental jet ``to make frequent trips to Switzerland, France,England and Ireland,'' Cotchett said.   The lawsuit shows a host of complicated financial transactions,some of which Cotchett claims were designed to cover up phony deals.   For instance, the papers said Keating's son, Charles KeatingIII, once visited Switzerland ostensibly to set up a foreigncurrency trading company with others in Zurich and in Dusseldorf,Germany. The senior Keating eventually paid a firm calledGesellschaft Fur Trend Analysen some $20 million for unknownreasons, the lawsuit said.   ``It is alleged that payments served as sham transactions tocover up Keating's transfer of monies from the United States toSwitzerland,'' the suit said.   The lawsuit contends that in a similar transaction, Keating usedLincoln money to form a subsidiary called Dungiven Investments.Dungiven then diverted $17.5 million to a Bahamian investmenttrading company called Trendinvest Ltd.   ``Millions of dollars were channeled through this subsidiary insupposed losses before the stock was sold back to Trendinvest,''the lawsuit said.   This was a sham to hide the transfer of money from the UnitedStates to offshore banks, Cotchett said.   Keating's American Continental also had ties to the London-basedKuwaiti Investment Office, which makes real estate investments onbehalf of the Kuwait government.   Specifically, Kuwaiti Investment had a 45 percent interest inThe Phoenician Resort, a 605-room luxury complex near Scottsdale,Ariz. The resort was owned by Lincoln.   Last week, federal regulators dismissed Keating and 23 familymembers and associates from positions at the Phoenician.</TEXT></DOC>
