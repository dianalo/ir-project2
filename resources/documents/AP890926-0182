Facing a criminal trial next year in the Iran-Contra scandal,Poindexter said he needs the records for his defense.   ``Former President Reagan believes that his diaries and notesare `personal' records,'' Poindexter said in the papers filed lateMonday and made available Tuesday.   ``President Reagan's `personal' diaries and notes remain in theformer president's possession and were not transferred to theNational Archives'' when he left the White House, the court paperssaid.   Poindexter's lawyers said in court Sept. 6 that Reagan's noteswill reflect that he authorized some activities for which thenational security adviser was indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal.   Poindexter said vice presidential records at the nationalarchives have yet to be processed and that to date no personaldiary from Bush's tenure as vice president has been discovered.   Poindexter's lawyers also say he regularly briefed Bush onaspects of the Iran-Contra affair following meetings which the vicepresident missed.   Poindexter said he intends to serve ``subpoenas on the formerpresident and former vice president personally.''   Poindexter asked that U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene toset a pre-trial return date for subpoenas of presidential and vicepresidential records and personal records of Reagan and Bush.   The former national security adviser is charged with one countof conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts ofmaking false statements in the Iran-Contra affair.   The Presidential Records Act says diaries, journals or otherpersonal notes of the president which aren't prepared in the courseof transacting government business don't have to be turned over tothe National Archives.   The records act was enacted in the aftermath of the Watergatescandal and lawsuits over ownership of the White Housetape-recordings during the presidency of Richard Nixon.</TEXT></DOC>
