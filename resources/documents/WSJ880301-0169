As Japanese exports have slumped because of the strong yen, the government has moved to spur local demand, partly through an emphasis on increased public-works spending.    In yesterday's reports, all for January, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japanese factories and mines rose 9.3% from a year earlier and a seasonally adjusted 0.6% from December; the Construction Ministry announced that housing starts increased 19% from a year earlier; and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said exports of cars, trucks and buses declined 9.1% in January from the year before.    MITI said the 9.3% increase in industrial production was the second-largest annual gain since output began a steady rise last June. An official said January's growth largely reflected a 2.5% increase in construction-machinery shipments that stemmed indirectly from the government emphasis on public-works projects.    The Construction Ministry, noting that housing starts have increased for 21 consecutive months, said the boom wasn't showing weakness, despite predictions by some economists that housing starts would begin to slow.    The January decline in vehicle exports followed a 2% rise in December, the first increase in 11 months. </TEXT></DOC>
