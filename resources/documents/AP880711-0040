Shultz said, meanwhile, that Washington has found ``otheroptions'' if the United States is forced to abandon its largestmilitary operation in Asia.   ``The presence of the United States in this region is asignificant factor, it's part of the strategic equation,'' Shultztold a news conference today.   ``The idea of the United States not being here is virtuallyunthinkable for people,'' he said in Jakarta, Indonesia, todaybefore leaving for Manila.   The future of seven U.S. military facilities is expected to be amajor issue in talks with Mrs. Aquino and other leaders. Streetdemonstrators and some politicians have called for their removaleven before a bases treaty expires in 1991.   The Manila stop is part of a nine-nation Asian and Pacific tourfor Shultz.   Neither the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, nor most ofits six members have publicly voiced support for continued U.S.military presence in the Philippines. But Shultz said talks withJapan, Australia and most association members have shown they areagainst their removal.   ``Our military people have had to think about how they are goingto carry out their mission and somewhat to their surprise theyfound ... ways of doing it,'' Shultz said. He declined to specifythe options.   Negotiations between the two countries began in April and wereto have concluded last week. But they have been stalled on thequestion of U.S. compensation to the Philippines and proposed curbson U.S. military operations at the facilies, sources close to thetalks said.   Mrs. Aquino indicated in a brief interview with Filipinoreporters at the presidential palace today that she may not bringup the subject of the bases when she meets with Shultz on Tuesday.   Reporters asked Mrs. Aquino if she expected her talks withShultz to lead to an agreement on compensation to the Philippinesfor continued use of Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and foursmaller facilities.   ``No,'' said Mrs. Aquino, ``because the review is still goingon, and it will be up to the review committee to discuss that.Shultz is not part of the review panel. It is (U.S. AmbassadorNicholas) Platt and on and on our side, (Foreign Secretary Raul)Manglapus.''   The United States currently gives the Philippines $180 millionin economic and military aid annually in exchange for use of thebases. Manglapus said when the talks began that $1.2 billion a yearwas a more ``realistic figure.''   Sources close to the talks say that the United States isunwilling to substantially increase current compensation levelswithout guarantees from the Manila government that it will extendthe lease on the bases when it expires in 1991.   In addition, the Senate also has passed a bill that seeks to bannuclear weapons or passage through the country of nuclear-armed andnuclear-powered ships. The bill has not been debated by the moreconservative House of Represenatives.   Shultz said last month that the United States would scuttle itsmilitary bases in the Philippines and terminate its securityrelationship with its former colony if such a bill were enacted.</TEXT></DOC>
