Case, after working an eight-hourday, took a night course in blueprint-reading on their own time.;    &quot;That'san idea of the environment that is here. . . . We have people we had to turnaway,&quot; said Bob Hamrick, employee relations manager.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Professional Careers  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MORE FIRMS EMPHASIZING JOB EDUCATIONA TRAINED WORKFORCE KEEPS COMPANY ON TOP,THEY SAY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     J.I. Case's turnover at its Wichita factory, which employs 400 people, was0.6 percent last year. And that includes retirements.;    This indicates &quot;thatpeople feel this is a good place to work, and that we value our employees morethan just bodies out there doing manual tasks,&quot; Hamrick said.;    But J.I.Case, which manufactures construction equipment, is giving its workers morepower to make decisions -- and also giving them the knowledge and skillsnecessary to make decisions.;    &quot;Any time you work with employees the waythey do, you are going to be able to retain them,&quot; said Jim Razey, specialistin job training for the Wichita Area Vocational Technical Schools.;    Theworld has changed, and companies like J.I. Case know it. The number ofcompanies that are emphasizing training -- and retaining -- their employees isgrowing. Personnel departments have become human resource departments, andthey are no longer an overlooked box on an organization chart.;    Thepersonnel departments at some companies resemble small school systems. BoeingWichita, for example, has 80 employees in its in-house training organization,said David Wenz, manager of human resources development.;    &quot;It's a priorityfor us. . . . The vast majority of our jobs out here require technicalexpertise and experience,&quot; he said.;    Employee training, in part, stems fromnecessity. Finding skilled, experienced employees is becoming increasinglydifficult. This is where retraining helps. Boeing has three programs designedto retrain employees for new jobs.;    For example, the company is retraining185 engineers and 40 draftsmen, who previously worked on military programs,for commercial operations. &quot;It is much more difficult to find engineers thanany other skill,&quot; Wenz said.;    Boeing also is retraining machinists who havebeen or will be laid off for jobs in sheet metal fabrication, qualityassurance and tooling -- areas where the company expects jobs to be availablein the future.;    The company prefers to retrain its employees for new jobsinstead of hiring new employees. But the program also benefits the company: Aretrained worker brings a broader understanding of the company to a new job.;   Other companies are using retraining programs to lessen the impact oftechnological change.;    Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. will reimbursetuition for an employee learning new skills. The benefit was negotiated by theCommunication Workers of America to help its members whose jobs are beingreplaced by new technology. An operator, for example, may learn to become acommunications technician.;    About 150 employees are going to school throughthe program, said Connie Brickner, manager of placement at Bell's personneldepartment. Brickner's job is to provide career advice to non-managementemployees. She advises employees, for example, on what skills the companyanticipates will be in short supply. And she teaches a class titled&quot;Individual Growth and Development.&quot;;    Twenty years ago, someone likeBrickner would have been rare in the corporate world. &quot;With the rapid increasein technology . . . education is going to be a lifetime experience foreveryone,&quot; Brickner said.;    For all the talk about rapidly changingtechnology and global competition, however, companies with extensive trainingprograms are relatively rare.;    &quot;I think there is large gap between thereality and the rhetoric,&quot; said Curtiss Plott, executive vice president of theAmerican Society of Training and Development.;    Only 20 percent of U.S.companies have comprehensive, companywide training programs, he said. And the$30 billion spent on training annually reaches only 11 percent of theworkforce.;    Most of these people, he added, already have college degrees ortechnical skills. And only the most progressive companies have extensiveretraining programs.;    &quot;We tend to value employees less than many of ourinternational competitors,&quot; Plott said.;    Companies have shown they can cutcosts. But few companies have shown skill in upgrading their products,manufacturing and employees.;    Companies stressing quality have done thebest job setting up strong training programs. And there is a growing awarenessthat workplace performance and skills are a key to increasingcompetitiveness.;    &quot;I think there is an enormous recognition of the problem,and that is the first step,&quot; Plott said.;    &quot;We know how to do this,&quot; headded. &quot;There are good models out there.&quot;;    J.I. Case is one model.;    Thecompany wants its employees to understand all aspects of its operations anddoes extensive cross-training. A machinist might be taught welding. This givesthe company increased flexibility in production and gives its employees morevariety in their jobs.;    The company's emphasis on training is purely abusiness decision. To stay competitive, the company must upgrade itsequipment, products, manufacturing and employee skills.;    &quot;The only realthing we can beat our competition on is our people -- our human assets,&quot;Hamrick said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GUY BOULTON, Knight-Ridder Newspapers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Wichita, Kan.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910519  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2PC  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  831  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday May 19, 199100140178,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
