AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is gone,but the question of fashioning a security force to replace hisbully boys is causing friction between the U.S. military and thenew Panamanian civilian government.   Sources on both sides agree there's a problem.   The civilians want a weakened army that would be little morethan a police force and would not represent a threat to thegovernment. The United States is pressing for a professional armyto provide security for the Panama Canal.   Panamanian civilians have been intimidated by the military formore than 20 years, suffering exile, torture, imprisonment anddeath. The Panamanian military has not had much respect forpoliticians, whom they considered weak and beholden to the UnitedStates.   ``The truth is that both, the civilian and the military must bere-educated,'' a U.S. military source told The Associated Press.   ``We are telling the Panamanian military that they mustunderstand their role in society under civilian power. And we aretelling the civilians that a strong military organization is neededtoo,'' the source said, on condition of anonymity.   The Panama Canal is due to be turned over to Panama on Dec. 31,1999, and U.S. bases are to be closed unless a further agreement isreached with the Panamanian government. Since the treaties give thetwo countries joint responsibiilty for canal security even after2000, U.S. sources say at least two bases probably will bemaintained, rather than the 10 major installations that now support12,000 troops.   Ironically, the Panamanian army under Omar Torrijos was the coreof the long drive to eliminate the sovereign U.S. enclave in theCanal Zone and negotiate the 1977 treaties. U.S. officials insistthe United States will honor the treaties.   The dispute over how to reconstitute the Panamanian forces istaking place even as U.S. officers work with Panamanian officers todo exactly that, despite civilian unease.   ``It is a matter of concern that the members of the DefenseForces are being reintegrated, and not by the Panamaniangovernment, but by the American Army,'' said Juan Materno Vasquez,a lawyer who helped negotiate the 1977 canal treaties but left thegovernment in a dispute with Noriega.   Vice president and minister of government Ricardo Arias Calderonhas spoken of a Public Security Force, avoiding all reference tothe old name of Defense Forces or previous names, such as NationalGuard.   ``You can call it what you will,'' a U.S. source said. ``It hasto be a professional force, army, national guard or whatever.''   U.S. military leaders here, who worked with the Panamanians foryears and know them well, feel some _ especially those jailed byNoriega following coup attempts _ can be trusted enough to form thecore of an army.   Before the U.S. attack that toppled Noriega Dec. 20, U.S.military sources told the AP that U.S. forces could ``work withsome of the Panamanian top officers, even if they are not shiningexamples of democracy.''   According to a Panamanian military source, U.S. officers wererather blunt when they told President Guillermo Endara what theywant in a Panamanian army. Endara was elected president May 7, butNoriega nullified the vote and Endara was not installed until afterthe U.S. assault.   ``The politicians did not shed any blood,'' another source said.``The blood was shed by the Americans and the few Defense Forcesunits that fought.''   Both the U.S. and Panamanian military, even those opposed toNoriega, feel the opposition was unwilling to take risks to try totopple Noriega. Comparisons with uprisings in South Korea, Chinaand, lately, Eastern Europe were raised frequently.   ``They want us to do the job for them,'' a top-ranking U.S.officer told the AP before U.S. forces did exactly that.   Some of the new leaders of the future Panamanian military arethe majors and captains who were arrested March 16, 1988, aftertheir failed coup against Noriega.   They include men like Maj. Santiago Fundora and Maj. AristidesValdonedo, who have been named directors of logistics and publicsecurity respectively, and Maj. August Villalaz, who will be incharge of the Air Force.   They have been working closely with the commander of U.S. ArmySouth, Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, and other Army officers at FortClayton, near Panama City.   ``The person who is really governing in Panama now is MarcCisneros,'' Vasquez said.   Vasquez said he saw a former lieutenant colonel surrender withother officers and return home with a ``passport from Cisneros, noteven from Panamanian authorities.''   ``We're concerned about too many of those guys coming back in,''said a Christian Democratic politician involved in forming the newgovernment. The Endara government would like to set up ``somethinglike what Costa Rica has.''   Costa Rica, just north of Panama, has been spared coups andmilitary rule in large measure because the armed forces weredissolved more than 40 years ago. Costa Rica has only a civilianpolice force and relies on the Organization of American Statescharter, which calls for collective defense in case of attack.   In essence that means relying on the United States, but U.S.officials are not sympathetic to the civilian government's desires.   ``Endara may feel that he was elected in May,'' one source said``but his majority meant nothing and he is where he is because ofthe American guns.''</TEXT></DOC>
