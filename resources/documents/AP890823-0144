At parliamentary caucuses, Mazowiecki stressed it could be riskynot to reach agreement with the communists _ especially when theystill control the army and security police.   Mazowiecki's olive branch followed communist demands for a fullcoalition partnership role. He made clear that offering the partysuch a role was realistic.   ``One cannot today form a government in Poland other than a broadcoalition having the support of all forces sitting at the Sejm,'' hetold Solidarity lawmakers.   But he also said he could not afford to give the communists toomuch.   ``We cannot allow the political forces which I represent andwhich nominated me as their candidate to be pushed into being(merely) symbolic things,'' he later told an evening caucus of thelawmakers from the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party _the two minor parties in the Solidarity coalition.   The remarks came one day after a 40-minute telephone talk betweenPolish Communist Party First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski andSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in which the two agreed it was``impossible'' to have a government without the communists.   The call by Gorbachev, also head of the Communist Party, was thefirst direct comment on the events in Poland. It was highly unusualfor the Polish party to publicize such a telephone conversation,announcing it at a news conference.   The publicity given the call appeared meant to stress the SovietUnion's interest in having a strong communist presence in Poland'snext government, but also that the communists should reach anaccommodation with the Solidarity-led coalition.   President Bush praised Gorbachev's position Wednesday, calling it``a positive sign.''   ``There will be bumps in the road as these countries move towardmore democracy,'' Bush said. ``But I feel the statement I sawattributed to Mr. Gorbachev was very positive in this regard _very.''   There were signs Wednesday that both sides in Poland are nearingan understanding.   Mazowiecki said it might be a mistake to offer the CommunistParty only the key ministries of defense and interior _ controllingthe army and the police _ that had been promised in the first stagesof negotiating the historic transition to the East bloc's firstgovernment led by non-communists.   ``Pushing the Communist Party into total negation would be a trapfor the country,'' he said.   Hinting the party would eventually take back power by forceunless a compromise was reached, he said, ``No opposition in theworld which ... has the army and security services ... remains theopposition.''   Mazowiecki, nominated for prime minister Saturday by communistPresident Wojciech Jaruzelski, is to be approved for the office whenthe Sejm, or lower house, meets Thursday.   He was proposed by a coalition assembled by Lech Walesa ofSolidarity and the Peasants and Democrats _ the two minor partiesthat have a majority in the chamber even without the communists.   The communists have insisted on a number of places in thegovernment to correspond to their ``state and political potential.''   Mazowiecki said he could not say how many of the 19 governmentministries would be offered the communists, or to Solidarity and thetwo minor parties. He said he plans to present a government within aweek.   Aleksander Bentkowski, parliamentary leader of the Peasants, saidthe communists want at least one deputy premiership and threeministries. A Solidarity lawmaker, Artur Balazs, said the partywanted a deputy premiership, four ministries and the office thatcontrols state radio and television.   Communist Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said that Mazowiecki'senvoy, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had his first talks Tuesday with partyCentral Committee Secretary Leszek Miller. Bisztyga refused tocomment on the party's demands.   Mazowiecki said there are no specific decisions, but it must be a``broad coalition.''   Mazowiecki told the Solidarity lawmakers that he had Jaruzelski'sassurance the army and security forces would cooperate with agovernment led by the opposition movement they had long sought torepress.   He also took a mild stance toward the removal of party loyalistsfrom state jobs. He said he plans no ``witch hunts'' and his onlycriteria would be ``competence and loyalty to the new government.''</TEXT></DOC>
