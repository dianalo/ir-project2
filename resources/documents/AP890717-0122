Syrian and Christian gunners dueled with tank and howitzer firein and around the capital, and Israeli-allied militiamen shelledPalestinian guerrilla positions in south Lebanon.   A spokesman for Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun saidthe Syrian gunboat intercepted the vessel 15 miles off the Christianport of Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut. Tripoli lies 50 milesnorth of the capital.   The spokesman identified the seized ship only as the Peter-M. Hesaid he had no information on its nationality, owners or tonnage.   The Syrian navy previously stopped several cargo vessels headedfor the beleaguered enclave, apparently to search them for arms. Theships were all allowed to continue on course, the spokesman said oncondition of anonymity.   Artillery explosions jolted both sides of divided Beirut as theSyrian army and Aoun's mainly Christian troops continued aconfrontation that dragged on with no solution in sight.   Thousands of civilians huddled in basements and undergroundshelters as howitzer, mortar and tank fire showered the city. Syriangunners enforced a blockade of the 310-square-mile Christianenclave, home to 1 million people, and Christian forces fired back.   Police reported one person killed and 15 wounded, raising theoverall toll to 419 killed and 1,688 wounded since the shellingbegan March 8.   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein blamed Syria forfailing to end the 14-year-old civil war, which has killed more than150,000 people. Syria backs the rival Moslem Cabinet of Salim Hossthat has existed since Aoun became head of a Christian Cabinet lastSeptember.   ``It is crystal clear that the Syrian regime is the main partyresponsible for the destruction of Lebanon and the dispersion of itspeople,'' he said in a speech marking the 21st anniversary of theBaath socialist party's rise to power in Iraq. Syria is ruled by arival faction of the party.   He reiterated his support for Aoun in the current fighting,saying ``Iraq remains committed to saving Lebanon from this (Syrian)tyranny and oppression.''   The Syrians have demanded a ban on Iraqi arms shipments to Aoun'sarmy and the removal of Soviet-designed Frog-7 missiles they claimAoun has acquired from Iraq. With their range of nearly 45 milesthey are capable of hitting the Syrian capital, Damascus.   Police said gunners of the South Lebanon Army militia shellednewly established Palestinian positions in the hills of Baslaya, sixmiles east of Sidon port. No casualties were reported.   Maj. Gen Antoine Lahd, commander of the 2,500-strong militia,said on the Voice of the South radio that he would shell Sidon'srefugee camps of Meih Meih and Ein el-Helweh if guerrillas do notwithdraw from the Baslaya area. No deadline was set.   The Syrians have maintained the siege on the Christian sectordespite repeated calls by the Arab League for a cease-fire and anend to the blockades.   The siege started one week after Aoun blockaded illegal ports runby Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of Beirut to recoup $100million in customs dues lost annually.   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, a staunch Syrian ally, retaliatedby shelling the Christian enclave. Syrian troops later joined thebombardment, sealed off the enclave's land exits and blockaded itssea outlets with artillery fire.   Syria keeps 40,000 soliders in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeepingmandate from the Arab League. The Christians, with 20,000 troops,say the Syrians betrayed their mandate by siding with the Moslems inthe civil war and should leave.</TEXT></DOC>
