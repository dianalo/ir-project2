<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1096 </DOCNO><TEXT>An engine concept is described in which methanol vapour generated by meansof the cooling water heat is used as fuel. The available alternativefuel technologies for diesel and spark ignition engines are describedand the experimental programme and its results are presented. The methanolvapour and methanol injection techniques are compared, and the influenceof constructional parameters on engine performance and cold startingcharacteristics with methanol vapour fuel is investigated. The authorconsiders the methanol vapour fuel concept as a viable alternative indiesel fuel substitution, both in terms of performance and pollutantemissions. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
