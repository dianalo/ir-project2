HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Medical schools have done a good job of recruitingwomen to their faculties but still rarely promote them to be deans,department heads and tenured professors, a study published todayconcludes.   The report found that even though their numbers have growndramatically, women still hold only a small share of the best jobsat medical schools. A decade ago, 8 percent of women faculty werefull professors. Now 9 percent are. By comparison, 32 percent of menfaculty are professors.   This means there are few women role models for young doctors.   ``Indeed,'' the report in the New England Journal of Medicineconcludes, ``there are few departments in any school in which astudent can readily find a woman physician in a senior position whois happy with both her professional life and available to give thestudent pointers and support.''   However, just why women doctors don't make it to the top is stillunclear.   ``We don't know if the women are choosing not to be on the tenuretrack or whether it's a whole series of smaller decisions that aremade for them because there isn't a flexible schedule for takingcare of small children,'' said Janet Bickel, who directed the studyand is head of women's programs at the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges in Washington.   Among the findings:   _Even though women make up 19 percent of medical schoolfaculties, they hold 7 percent of the full professorships.   _During the past 10 years, the number of women on medical schoolfaculties has grown from 6,249 to 10,840.   _Two of the nation's 127 medical schools are headed by women,compared with none a decade ago. The number of medical schooldepartments led by women has increased from 56 to 70.   _One-third of medical school students are female, up fromone-quarter 10 years ago.   The work is a followup to a study co-authored seven years ago byDr. Marilyn Heins of the University of Arizona College of Medicine.   ``The numbers look better,'' Heins said. ``There are more womenstudents and residents. But in terms of women in top positions,really nothing much has changed.''   In an interview, Bickel said she doubts that women fail to reachthe top in academic medicine because of frank discrimination.   ``Something tells me people would have found their way to mytelephone if there was outright discrimination based on gender,''she said. ``I think we have gotten to the point in the facultyreview process where people seriously try to be fair.''   Typically, junior faculty members are given seven or eight yearsto earn tenure. If they fail to get it, they leave or takenon-tenure track jobs. But they rarely are given a second chance toearn tenure, which is a crucial step toward high-level positions inmedical schools.   Whether or not young doctors get tenure rests largely on how manyresearch papers they have published. Bickel said other studies haveshown that women faculty members do less research than men.   Bickel said it's possible that a woman doctor with small children``gives up her research interests because she is already working 60hours a week teaching and taking care of patients. The research andpublishing that are necessary to present oneself for tenure arelost.''   She said medical schools could make tenure easier for women byproviding more flexible schedules, parenting leaves andopportunities to work toward tenure later in their careers.</TEXT></DOC>
