Student leaders charged the Games were being used to cementmilitary rule.   About 2,000 students from several Seoul colleges rallied at thecapital's Yonsei University, denouncing the Olympics, President RohTae-woo's government and the United States for backing thegovernment.   ``Down with military dictatorship,'' the students chanted asthey marched around the campus with red, white and blue flags.   The students, some armed with wooden and iron clubs, thenmarched out of the school to confront hundreds of riot police whowere surrounding the campus. Protesters taunted the police and thenattacked.   Waves of masked students rushed out of the school's gates andclimbed over walls to pelt police with firebombs that exploded inorange balls of blazing gasoline. The firebombs exploded among thepolice, setting fire to troopers' shields and clothing.   Police, dressed in green combat fatigues and black visoredhelmets, did not use tear gas because of government orders not touse the powerful gas during the Olympics. They also hurled backfewer rocks than in similar protests in the past.   Police said they had no reports of arrests or injuries. Theclash lasted about 30 minutes and was confined to the highway infront of the school.   Student and dissident leaders speaking at the rally charged theRoh government with using the Olympics, which begin Sept. 17, tocement authoritarian rule.   ``The Olympics are being used to cement the fascist regime,''said a statement by the protesters. ``The regime is making all outefforts to weaken the people's power.''   Speakers charged the United States with conspiring with Roh tocontinue military rule. The United States has about 42,000 troopsin South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   Radical leaders have called for anti-Olympic protests, but theprotests so far have been confined to a few campuses in Seoul andseveral other cities. There have been no demonstrations nearOlympic sites.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, havevirtually no public support. Most Koreans are critical of protestsagainst the Olympics and want nothing to disrupt the Games.   Roh, a former general who won presidential elections inDecember, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantledauthoritarian controls.</TEXT></DOC>
