In the past, the landlords generally allowed tenants to break leases without having to pay rent for the remaining months of the contract. The reason: Markets were healthy and renters plentiful, so vacant units filled quickly. But the lingering softness in many of the region's markets, largely caused by overbuilding, has made owners less forgiving.    In Tulsa, Okla., for instance, Crosshaven Properties Inc. recently started asking tenants who break rental agreements more than three months before the lease expires to pay two months rent. Folsom Investments in Dallas is making similar demands and reports tenants to credit agencies if they refuse to pay.    And in Colorado, &quot;as we've gotten into tougher markets, we've seen more owners interested&quot; in seeking payments from tenants who move out early, says Manny High, executive director of the 800-member Apartment Association of Metro Denver.    In these states, landlords generally have the right to charge the tenant for the duration of the lease. But landlords usually don't take tenants to court in such cases because it isn't worth the expense. Instead, they rely on collection agencies and settlements with tenants.    Some people are scoffing at the demands. After she got a new job in Cincinnati, Debra D. Dennis broke her lease on a $300-a-month apartment in Fort Worth, Texas, seven months into the one-year rental agreement. She gave the apartment owners 30 days notice, but they demanded more than $2,000 in rent for the balance of the lease. Even though a collection agency has contacted her, Ms. Dennis refuses to pay. &quot;I'm not going to pay for something I'm not living in,&quot; she says.    Comparative Shopping   Gets Easier for ARMs   HOME BUYERS shopping around for the best adjustable-rate mortgage are getting some help from Uncle Sam. Lenders have started providing more details on ARMs, under a rule adopted last month by the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Reserve.    The new rule, which had been sought by Congress and consumer groups, requires lenders to disclose the index to which the ARM is tied, how often the loan is adjusted and the maximum amount that loan payments can increase.    A Bank Board spokesman says the rule makes it easier for borrowers to compare ARMs offered by mortgage bankers, thrifts and commercial banks. Previously, disclosure varied because the three agencies had different requirements.    Although ARMs are no longer as complex as they were when they first appeared in 1981, consumers have continued to complain about the confusing way these mortgages are calculated and the frequency of payment adjustments, among other things.    Real-Estate Studies   Growing in Popularity   DESPITE soft markets for commercial and residential real estate in many cities, several universities say enrollment in graduate-school real-estate studies is up sharply.    At the University of California at Berkeley, 113 students are pursuing an M.B.A. with a real-estate concentration, up from 50 at the start of last year's fall semester. Robert H. Edelstein, chairman of Berkeley's Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics, says student interest in the program &quot;is higher than anyone expected.&quot; At Ohio State University's College of Business, 17 students are either majoring in or pursuing a concentration in real estate, up from three at the start of last year's fall term.    And at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, enrollment in the real-estate graduate program this fall climbed to 120 students from 80 students a year ago.    Even schools that began graduate real-estate programs this fall say demand has been greater than expected. At New York University in New York City, 144 students are enrolled this fall in the school's new master's program for real-estate development and investment -- almost triple the university's initial estimate.    Students are flocking to the programs because they think the industry's condition is cyclical and that it soon will be improving, says Mr. Edelstein. At Ohio State, administrators attribute the increase to students' interest in a more entrepreneurial career. Other administrators say some of the new recruits are students who changed their minds about careers on Wall Street after last year's stock-market crash.    The universities expect enrollments to continue growing. At NYU, administrators estimate next fall's enrollment in the program will swell to 250.    Odds and Ends   BIGGER is better -- at least when it comes to the square footage of a new home, according to preliminary results of a consumer survey by the National Association of Home Builders. Also on home buyers' wish lists: more energy-efficient dwellings, more luxurious houses and larger lots. On average, today's new home fits the bill in every category except lot size, which has decreased because of high land costs. . . . Top executives at mortgage banking concerns, who receive much of their compensation from bonuses, have been taking home less money this year, reflecting a decline in loan volume, says Sibson andamp; Co., a Princeton, N.J., consulting firm. On average, chief executive officers have seen their total compensation fall 8% this year to an estimated $269,000 from $292,000. </TEXT></DOC>
