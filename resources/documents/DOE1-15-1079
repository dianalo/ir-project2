<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1079 </DOCNO><TEXT>Nuclear and atomic methods of analysis, which rely on the detection ofprompt and delayed radiations, emitted as a result of interactions betweenradiation probe and target, for determining the elemental concentration'in vivo' and 'in vitro', are summarily reviewed, with reference to boneanalysis. The way neutrons can be used as probes to investigate the compositionand structure of objects by employing the principles of computerisedtomography are outlined and the novel modes of utilisation are brieflydescribed: neutron transmission tomography, neutron induced prompt gamma-rayemission tomography and neutron induced delayed gamma-ray emission tomography.</TEXT></DOC>
