It is concluded that thethermal decay of the spin adducts of phosphate-ester radicals with PBNcan be characterized as a pseudomonomolecular reaction. Finally, PBNcan be successfully used as a spin trap in the radiolysis of phosphoricor alkylphosphoric acid esters. (author) 13 refs.; 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
