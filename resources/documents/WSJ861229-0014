Myers</HL><DD> 12/29/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXESECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most forecasters expect only modest growth in the economy next year and thus only modest growth in profits. And as the economic expansion ages, they may well be right.    However, hundreds of U.S. companies have been cutting costs ruthlessly, and even slightly stronger business might lift profits significantly. Although a business pickup is far from a sure thing, there are grounds for optimism: The personal-income tax cuts could revive consumer spending. And, aided by the lower dollar, a long-awaited narrowing of America's trade deficits could help U.S. companies in both domestic and foreign markets.    Higher profits are significant. They could encourage capital spending and corporate hiring. By facilitating dividend increases, they could spur consumer buying. And they could give the stock market, sparked for four years mainly by declining interest rates, another upward push.    Admittedly, the consensus forecasts, as compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, envision little excitement. The four dozen economists surveyed by the publication expect, on the average, inflation-adjusted gross national product to grow only 2.5% next year and pre-tax corporate profits to rise only 8.3% -- though the individual profit forecasts vary from a 29.3% gain to a 7% drop. The after-tax outlook seems even dicier. In both the current quarter and the 1987 first period, after-tax profits will be badly skewed by the new tax law.    The legislation canceled the investment tax credit, retroactive to Jan. 1, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board told corporations to take the entire hit in the fourth quarter. According to the Commerce Department, cancellation of the credit and other changes will slash fourth-quarter net income by about $11.2 billion on an annual basis.    In the 1987 first quarter, corporations will be bashed again as the new tax provisions kick in. Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates expects what Douglas P. Handler, an economist at the firm, calls &quot;a one-time statistical quirk&quot; -- a 10.2% drop in after-tax, seasonally adjusted profits from the 1986 fourth quarter.    Over the 1986-91 period, business taxes are scheduled to rise about $120 billion because, Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers notes, &quot;the lower corporate profits tax rates cannot offset the effects of the lost tax subsidies.&quot; He cites not only the withdrawn investment tax credit but, among other things, tighter depreciation rules, slower write-offs of other costs and a stiffer alternative minimum corporate tax.    Here are the Blue Chip consensus estimates of seasonally adjusted annual profits rounded off into billions of dollars and calculated quarter by quarter, starting with the 1986 third quarter and running through the 1987 fourth period:    Profits before taxes:   $241 259 278 289 301 317    Profits after taxes:   $144 136 135 141 148 157    The tax changes will hit various industries very differently. Because tax cuts will put more money in consumers' pockets, &quot;consumer-related industries, both nonfinancial and financial, should benefit as well,&quot; Mr. Sinai comments. In contrast, he says, &quot;Large industrial, capital-intensive companies are the biggest losers.&quot; Among the losers, he lists commercial construction, aluminum, automobiles, chemicals, forest products, metals, machinery, oil services and rubber. Among the winners, he says, will be beverages, health care, furniture, media and various retailers.    The tax changes are strongly influencing many economists partly because they don't expect profits to get any big lift from economic growth. But Lacy Hunt of CMandamp;M Group expects GNP to grow 3.2% next year and consumer-goods inflation to rise to 4%. &quot;I see a much better international climate for American manufacturing firms,&quot; he says. He expects &quot;the trade deficit to drop to $130 billion next year from the $163 billion annual rate in the third quarter,&quot; and he says companies &quot;are going to get some price relief as well as better volume.&quot;    A turnaround in trade, says Nigel Gault of Data Resources, would especially benefit the capital-goods sector. &quot;The prices of imported machinery and equipment have risen rapidly over the past year,&quot; he explains, &quot;and we feel that U.S. producers have become much more competitive.&quot;    Wharton's Mr. Handler sees GNP rising at a 3% annual rate in the first half and 3.5% to 4% in the second half -- and thus higher profits. &quot;Capacity utilization is down, we have very good management of inventories, the capital equipment is in place, there is no labor shortage, and, with any marginal increase in GNP, corporations would be able to meet extra demand with very little expense and very profitably,&quot; he says.    Yet, the comprehensive productivity statistics don't reflect the extensive cost-cutting campaigns at many companies over the past few years. Lawrence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics notes that &quot;a large fraction of new jobs are in relatively low-wage, low-productivity occupations and industries -- this is holding down overall productivity growth.&quot;    Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, agrees that the statistics don't reflect the &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; of such gains. And that evidence is abundant; in company after company, employment has been slashed while output has held steady or grown. In many cases, the costs of cutting back initially depress profits, but Mrs. Freedman says the gains &quot;eventually will show in the data.&quot; All that it might take, in fact, is a 1987 economy somewhat stronger than most economists expect. </TEXT></DOC>
