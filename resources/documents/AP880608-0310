The vote was 61-37, with 10 Republicans abandoning the WhiteHouse and supporting override of the measure, which would overhaulprocedures under which the government imposes import curbs toassist U.S. industries and retaliate against international tradeviolations.   Just two Democrats voted to sustain Reagan's second veto of amajor trade bill in three years.   ``This controversy with the president is not about trade, it isnot even about economics. It is about politics,'' Sen. Pete V.Domenici, R-N.M., told the Senate. He hailed burgeoning U.S.exports and improved trade figures.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, aco-sponsor, said, however, ``They'll be rejoicing in Japan, they'llbe popping champagne corks in Germany'' as a result of the action.   The vote was five short of the two-thirds majority needed tooverride the veto by Reagan, who had objected to the provisions inthe bill that included plant closings notification and restrictionson Alaskan oil exports.   Republican critics of the defeated measure blasted itsspecial-interest provisions and said protectionist provisions hadnot been fully removed.   But supporters in both parties said the 1,000-page bill wasvitally needed by farmers and heavy industries feeling harsh tradepressures.   The Senate's action was accompanied by renewed calls for a moremoderate version that Reagan could sign before the Novemberelection.   Sen. Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., raised thepossibility, however, that such a stripped-down trade measure mightbecome hopelessly entangled in the Senate's complex procedures. Hesaid that would force a choice between the bill Reagan vetoed or nobill.   Byrd voted against the measure in a parliamentary move thatwould allow him to bring the bill back again. He said he hopedconstituents would pressure their senators to revive the measurebefore Congress adjourns for the fall election campaign.   He said his parliamentary ploy was ``insurance that the Americanpeople can still get a trade bill this year.''   Reagan issued a statement saying he was pleased by the vote.   ``As I said in my veto message on the bill, I am committed toenactment of a responsible trade bill this year,'' the presidentsaid. ``I am directing my senior advisors to stand ready to assistthe congressional leadership on a new trade bill _ one that willstrengthen America's international competitiveness and create evenmore new jobs for Americans.''   There also were pointed reminders from both Republican andDemocratic lawmakers that Reagan's supporters on the issue couldcome under political attack for opposing the bill, with itsprovision to require notice to employees of plant closings andlarge-scale layoffs.   ``We may lose the battle, but we've won the war on this issue,''Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said. ``This is no longer an issuebetween the Congress and the White House. It is now a presidentialcampaign issue. Governor (Michael) Dukakis stands by working menand women who deserve notice of plant closings.''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., conceded there were noassurances that a revised bill could win approval this year. He didsay it ``can be done if the leaders in the Senate and the leadersin the House will agree with the administration and then agree tono more amendments.''   Dole told the Senate the bill should get a more critical lookbecause ``it fails the truth in advertising test.''   Far from being devoted to opening global markets for Americangoods, Dole said, the measure represents ``a grabbag of provisionsof questionable merit.'' He cited measures to allow in duty-freeethanol and aid major banks stuck with billions of dollars in ThirdWorld debt.   Supporters of the measure continued to view a provision callingfor advance notice of plant closings as their most powerfulpolitical weapon.   ``If you support the president, you will be turning your back onAmerican workers when they are most in need,'' said Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``You'll be siding with high-priced corporatelobbyists and fat-cat business executives who are protected bygolden parachutes.''   The 1,000-page document produced by a House-Senate conferencecommittee won 63-36 Senate approval on April 27.   Reagan vetoed the measure May 24, focusing his criticism on theplant-closings provision, which would require companies with 100employees or more to provide them with 60-day notice of closingsand large-scale layoffs. Reagan said it would rob managers of theflexibility needed to keep their businesses in peak economic health.   Reagan also was critical of an array of other provisions,including what he described as overly stringent restrictions onAlaskan oil exports.   But the House quickly overrode his veto, 308-113. That left itup to the Senate whether to enact the bill over the president'sveto.   The bill also would have boosted by $1 billion payments to graincompanies to export U.S. crops and furnish both farmers and theadvertising industry with additional subsidies to stimulateoverseas sales of American agricultural commodities. The windfallprofits tax on oil companies would be repealed under the measure.   The measure also would make it more difficult for prosecutors toconvict U.S. business executives of complicity in payoffs toforeign officials. ``That's why I call it the bring-back-briberybill,'' said retiring Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., its loneDemocratic critic.   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was sharply critical of restrictionson Alaskan oil exports. One would permit shipment to Canada of50,000 barrels of crude daily but require that the petroleum betaken first to a port in the lower 48 states. The other would limitexport of products from new refineries to 70,000 barrels a day andhalf of output.</TEXT></DOC>
