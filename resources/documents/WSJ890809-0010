The 67-page lawsuit, filed on behalf of 84,000 retired white-collar employees, is the latest backlash against GM's attempts to cut costs at the expense of its salaried work force. Earlier this year, a group of current employees filed a class-action lawsuit charging that the auto maker used a merit-pay system to discriminate against older workers. The merit-pay system, which had the effect of denying raises to at least 10% of salaried workers, has since been discontinued.    The most recent suit charges that GM breached contractual obligations to provide lifetime health benefits. In a prepared statement, plaintiff Robert Sprague said the suit had been filed &quot;to force GM to honor its solemn contract and moral obligation to its salaried retirees.&quot;    A GM spokeswoman declined to respond directly to the retirees' suit. But she said the benefits GM provides salaried retirees are among the best of any major U.S. corporation.    In March 1988, GM eliminated a special policy that provided vision care and hearing aids for retirees and grouped those benefits under its basic health plan. Four months later, GM imposed co-payments and deductibles for the first time on that traditional insurance plan to encourage employees to switch to a managed-cost program such as a health maintenance organization.    Small groups of retirees have protested the cost-cutting moves at the last two GM annual meetings. In March 1989, GM restored its former vision care and hearing aid benefits.    The retired employees are represented by the Washington office of the Chicago law firm Bell, Boyd andamp; Lloyd. </TEXT></DOC>
