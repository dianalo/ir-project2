Specimens of polycrystal commercial nickel(99.5%) were annealed at 800 deg C during 1 hour and then were irradiatedby 0.5x10/sup 26/ and 3.2x10/sup 26/ neutr./m/sup 2/ fluences at 400-450deg C and 0.9x10/sup 26/ neutr./m/sup 2/ (E/sub n/andgt;0.1 MeV) at 550-600deg C. Some nickel specimens irradiated at 400-450 deg C by 3.2x10/sup26/ neutr./m/sup 2/ were annealed at 700, 750 and 850 deg C during 1-7hours. The results of electron-microscopic studies of void nucleationon grain boundaries and development of porosity in boundary regions innickel after fast neutron irradiation and high-temperature annealingsare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
