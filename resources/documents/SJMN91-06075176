The mayor and a city councilman also have resigned in the lastyear.;    &quot;All the decisions were separately made,&quot; City Councilwoman GinaKoshland said. &quot;All were completely unrelated.&quot;;    Caires, who left onvacation after submitting his resignation, could not be reached for comment.While characterized by city officials as a popular and highly skilled publicmanager, Caires had recently taken heat from city employees who blamed him forthe city's financial woes.;    After Caires recommended that three employeesbe laid off last month, he was blasted by Steve O'Keefe, representing theService Employees International Union. O'Keefe told the city council that amajority of city employees had no confidence in Caires' ability to lead thecity out of its financial crisis.;    Scotts Valley's revenues for the fiscalyear ending in June are expected to fall $276,140 short of the $5.4 millionanticipated earlier.;    Walpole's first official assignment is to report tothe council next week with plans to recruit a new city manager. While he isacting as city manager, police Capt. Tom Bush will serve as acting policechief.;    One of Caires' last official acts was to recommend that PublicWorks Director Bob Rockett resign, Mayor Joe Miller confirmed. Rockett quit,saying he could not afford to accept the 10 percent cut in hours and wagesthat the city has proposed for its employees. He could not be reached foradditional comment.;    Miller also confirmed the city was conducting an&quot;internal investigation&quot; but declined further comment.;    Walpole said hecould not comment on personnel matters, but emphasized that the city is notconducting a major investigation. &quot;An administrative review has beencompleted,&quot; he said. &quot;I see no need for any criminal or administrative actionto be taken at this point.&quot;;    Rockett's duties will be shared, with KenAnderson taking over the city's maintenance and engineering departments, andBob Geyer heading the sanitation and wastewater divisions. Miller said thereare no immediate plans to hire a new public works director.;    Miller, whohas been on the city council since 1984, was selected by his colleagues toserve as mayor last month after Michael Caffrey resigned to devote more timeto his family and a new business venture. His departure left an empty seat onthe council, to be filled by voters on June 4.;    The exodus began last Julywhen Councilman Gerald Pittenger resigned and moved to his vacation home inYuma, Ariz.;    Scotts Valley's finance director, Joyce Bray, will retire inJuly. She has worked for the city since 1970.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TERRI MORGAN, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910315  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  476  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 15, 199100075176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
