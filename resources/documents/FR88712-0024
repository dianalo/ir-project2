The schedule for submittal and promulgation of these visibilityprovisions was renegotiated and subsequently extended by a court orderon September 9, 1986. The second part of the settlement agreement required EPA to propose andpromulgate Federal Visibility SIP's henceforth called Federal ImplementationPlans (FIP's), addressing the general visibility plan provisions includingimplementation control strategies (andSection; 51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection; 51.302 through 51.307), and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306) for those states whose SIP's EPA had determined to be inadequatewith respect to the above provisions (see January 23, 1986, notice of deficiency(51 FR 3046) and March 12, 1987, notice proposing FIP's for deficient StateSIP's (52 FR 7803)). However, as provided in the renegotiated settlementagreement, a state could avoid the promulgation of said provisions if theysubmitted a visibility SIP by August 31, 1987. The State of Georgia submittedsuch an approvable plan revision.

This submittalcontained certification that the revision was preceded by adequate noticeand a public hearing. A discussion of the revision now follows. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backgound</ITAG>On December 2, 1980, EPA promulgated visibility regulations at 45 FR 80084,codified at 40 CFR 51.300 et seq. The visibility regulations required thatthe 36 states listed in andSection; 51.300(b)(2): (1) Develop a program toassess and remedy visibility impairment from new and existing sources,(2) develop a long-term (10 to 15 years) strategy to assure progress towardthe national goal, (3) develop a visibility monitoring strategy to collectinformation on visibility conditions, and (4) consider any ``integral vistas''(important views of landmarks or panoramas that extend outside of the boundariesof the Class I area and considered by the Federal Land Managers (FLM's)to be critical to the visitor's enjoyment of the Class I areas) in allaspects of visibility protection. These regulations only address a typeof visibility impairment which can be traced to a single source or smallgroup of sources known as reasonably attributable impairment or ``plumeblight.'' The EPA deferred action on the regulation of widespread homogeneoushaze (referred to as regional haze) and urban plumes due to scientificand technical limitations in visibility monitoring techniques and modelingmethods (see 45 FR 80085 col. 3). In December 1982, environmental groups filed a citizen's suit in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of California allegingthat EPA had failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty under section 110(c)of the Act to promulgate visibility SIP's for the 35 states that had failedto submit SIP's to EPA (EDF vs Gorsuch, Number C82-6850 RPA). The Stateof Alaska had submitted a SIP which was approved on July 5, 1983, at 48FR 30623. the EPA and the plaintiffs negotiated a settlement agreementfor the remaining states which the court approved by order on April 20,1984. EPA announced the details of the settlement agreement at 49 FR 20647(May 16, 1984).The settlement agreement required EPA to promulgate federal visibilitySIP's, henceforth called Federal Implementation Plans (FIP's) on a specifiedschedule for those states that had not submitted visibility SIP revisionsto EPA. Specifically, the first part of the agreement required EPA to proposeand promulgate FIP's which cover the monitoring and new source review (NSR)provisions under 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 provided the states did not submitSIP's by certain dates specified in the agreement. On May 22, 1985, and October 31, 1985, Georgia submitted Part 1 visibilityprovisions to EPA for approval. On May 22, 1985, the State submitted its``Plan for Visibility Protection in Class I Areas.'' The plan containeda narrative discussion of the scope and intent of Georgia visibility program,and described the State's visibility monitoring strategy. It also containedrevisions to the State's new source review and Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD) regulations. On October 31, 1985, the State submitteda schedule for finalizing the details of their monitoring strategy. Together,these submittals satisfied the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307.EPA subsequently approved the revisions on January 28, 1986, (51 FR 3466).The second part of the settlement agreement required EPA to determine theadequacy of the SIP's to meet the remaining provisions of the visibilityregulations. These provisions are the general plan provisions includingimplementation control strategies (andSection; 51.302), integral vista protection(andSection;andSection; 51.302 through 51.307) and long-term strategies (andSection;51.306). The settlement agreement required EPA to propose and promulgateFIP's on a specified schedule to remedy any deficiencies. The originaldeadlines for promulgating the FIP's were extended by a court order onSeptember 9, 1986. The order provided that a state could avoid federalpromulgation if it submitted a SIP to address the Part 2 (remaining visibilityprovisions) requirements by August 31, 1987.The remaining visibility provisions are spelled out in andSection; 51.302(c)(General Plan Requirements) and require that the SIP's include:1. An assessment of visibility impairment and a discussion of how eachelement of the plan relates to the national goal,2. Emission limitations, or other control measures, representing best availableretrofit technology (BART) for certain sources,3. Provisions to protect integral vistas identified pursuant to andSection;51.304,4. Provisions to address any existing impairment certified by the FLM,and5. A long-term (10-15) year strategy for making progress toward the nationalgoal pursuant to andSection; 51.306.On January 23, 1986, at 51 FR 3046, EPA preliminarily determined that theSIP's of 32 states (including Georgia) were deficient with respect to theremaining visibility provisions. In that same notice, based on informationreceived from the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Roosevelt CampobelloInternational Park Commission, 10 Class I areas in 7 states were identifiedas experiencing visibility impairment within the park boundaries whichmay be traceable to specific sources (reasonably attributable impairment(RAI)). However, the DOI stated in its certification of impairment thatthe results from the National Park Service (NPS) visibility monitoringprogram indicate that scenic views are affected by uniform haze at allNPS monitoring locations within the lower 48 states. Georgia was not identifiedas experiencing RAI. Also, no integral vista has been identified for anyClass I area in Georgia. Since Georgia's Class I areas are not experiencingreasonably attributable impairment of visibility, and since no integralvistas have been identified, items 2, 3, and 4 of the above list do notapply (this is so stated in the Georgia plan). The Georgia plan revolvessolely about the State's long-term strategy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Plan Requirements_Long-Term Strategy</ITAG>EPA's regulations require that the long-term strategy be a 10 to 15 yearplan for making reasonable progress towards the national goal. The long-termstrategy must cover any existing impairment that the FLM certified andany integral vista that the FLM's have declared at least six months beforeplan submission. A long-term strategy must be developed which covers eachClass I area within the state and each Class I area in another state thatmay be affected by sources within the state. The strategy must be coordinatedwith existing plans and goals for a Class I area including those of theFLM's. The strategy must state with reasonable specificity why it is adequatefor making reasonable progress toward the national goal and include provisionsfor the review of the impact of new sources as required by andSection; 51.307.The state must consider as a minimum the following six factors in the long-termstrategy:1. Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs;2. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance;3. Measures to mitigate the impacts of construction activities;4. Source retirement and replacement schedules;5. Smoke management techniques for agricultural and forestry managementpurposes, including such plans as currently exist within the state forthese purposes; and6. Enforcement of emission limitations and control measures.The SIP must include a statement as to why these factors were or were notaddressed in developing the long-term strategy.The state must commit to periodic review, and revision if appropriate,of the SIP on a schedule not less frequent than every three years. At thetime of the periodic review, a report must be developed in consultationwith the FLM's and submitted to the Administrator and to the public. Thereport must contain an assessment of the following:1. The progress achieved in remedying existing impairment of visibilityin any mandatory Class I federal area;2. The ability of the long-term strategy to prevent future impairment ofvisibility in any mandatory Class I federal area;3. Any change in visibility since the last such report, or in the caseof the first report, since plan approval;4. Additional measures, including the need for SIP revisions, that maybe necessary to assure reasonable progress toward the national visibilitygoal;5. The progress achieved in implementing BART and meeting other schedulesset forth in the long-term strategy;6. The impact of any exemption granted under andSection; 51.303; and7. The need for BART to remedy existing visibility impairment of any integralvista listed in the plan since the last such report, or, in the case ofthe first report, since plan approval.<ITAG tagnum="85">Revision to Georgia's Plan for Visibility Protection in Class I Areas</ITAG>The revision to Georgia's plan for visibility protection in Class I areas,entitled ``Visibility SIP'', is divided into 3 main sections as follows:<ITAG tagnum="16">I. Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">II. Additional Visibility SIP Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">III. General Plan Requirements</ITAG>Section (Background) describes the scope and intent of Georgia's visibilityprogram. It identified that in May 1985 the GEPD adopted its original planfor visibility protection in Class I areas in Georgia. It restates fromthe May 1985 plan the three mandatory class I areas in Georgia_the Okeefenokee,Cohutta, and Wolf Island Wilderness Areas. It identifies the nearby ClassI areas located in North Carolina which may be affected by sources in Georgia_theJoyce Kilmer_Slick Rock and Shining Rock Wilderness Areas. It restatesthe pollutants which are most involved in visibility impairment_fine particulates,nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. It points out that in the originalplan, Georgia provided its preliminary assessment of visibility impairmentin each of the Class I areas, that Georgia coordinated its plan developmentwith the affected FLM's, and that the original plan outlines the State'snotification and review procedures for evaluating new sources and describesthe State's visibility monitoring plan.Section II (Additional Visibility SIP Requirements) states that the originalplan addressed visibility monitoring and new source review, and the remainingportion of the visibility SIP requirements are being addressed by thisrevision.Section III (General Plan Requirements) addresses each of the general planrequirements pursuant to 40 CFR 51.302(c) as previously identified. InMarch 1985, the GEPD contacted the FLM's for the Class I areas and requestedtheir assistance in characterizing the visibility needs for each area.None of the FLM's identified any integral vistas nor any existing manmadevisibility impairment attributable to a source or small group of sources.In June and July 1987, the FLM's were notified and provided the opportunityto participate in the further development of the visibility protectionprogram (copies of correspondence included with plan). This notificationmeets the Federal Land Manager Coordination requirements as specified in40 CFR 51.302.Since reasonably attributable impairment has not been identified for anyof the Class I areas covered by the Georgia plan, and no integral vistashave been identified, the State need not address the general plan requirementsfor BART, Integral Vistas, or provisions to address existing visibilityimpairment. However, the State has provided that Federal Land Managersmay in the future identify visibility impairment due to individual sources,and at such time the State will review its plan and the need for BART.A BART analysis will be performed and the source or sources will be requiredto implement a BART decision.The final provision of the general plan requirements is the State's long-term(10-15 year) strategy for making reasonable progress towards the nationalgoal. In developing the long-term strategy, the GEPD addressed each ofthe six factors required by andSection; 51.306(e) as follows:1. Emission reductions due to ongoing air pollution control programs_Georgiastated that it presently operates an air pollution control program whichaddresses control of existing as well as new sources for emissions of particulatematter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. They feel these programs areadequate for preventing any future visibility impairment.2. Additional emission limitations and schedules for compliance_The Stateis not considering any additional emission regulations since reasonablyattributable impairment has not been identified.3. Measures to mitigate the impact of construction activities_The Statepoints out that the Class I areas in Georgia are located in areas whichconstruction activities are at a minimum. They also state that a fugitivedust regulation is in place to provide for reasonable control of constructionactivities. They feel that construction activities have little or no impacton visibility in any of the Class I areas in Georgia.4. Source retirement and replacement schedules_The State does not feelthat a specific retirement or replacement program is needed at this time.5. Smoke management techniques for agriculture and forest management purposes_TheState does not have regulations which limit forest or agricultural burning.Prescribed burning on forest and agricultural lands does occur under thesupervision of the Georgia Forestry Commission using established prescribedburning procedures which are used to minimize the impacts on visibilityof the burns. The State does have a regulation which addresses open burningof land clearing materials and yard trash. The State feels that these proceduresare adequate for making progress towards the national goal.6. Enforcement of emission limitations and control measures_Georgia statesthat it has an ongoing and effective enforcement program that is adequatefor making progress towards the national goal.The final portion of Georgia's long-term strategy involves the State'srequirement to periodically review and revise (as appropriate) the long-termstrategy, and to prepare a report to the Administrator and to the publicpursuant to andSection; 51.306(c). The State of Georgia has fully met thisrequirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>After reviewing Georgia's plan for the protection of visibility in federalClass I areas, EPA finds that the plan satisfies all of the remaining requirementsof the visibility regulations specified in the second part of the settlementagreement. EPA is therefore approving the visibility plan submitted bythe State of Georgia on August 31, 1987.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective September 12, 1988, unless, within 30 daysof its publication, notice is received that adverse or critical commentswill be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective September12, 1988.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by September 12, 1988. This action may not be challenged laterin proceedings to enforce its requirements.
