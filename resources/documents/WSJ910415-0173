Their decision would likely add to pressure on Congress tosettle a strike quickly, if one is called after 12:01 a.m.Wednesday, when a cooling-off period expires.</LP><TEXT>   A spokesman for Norfolk Southern Corp. in Norfolk, Va.,said that if there is a nationwide strike, or a selectivestrike against Norfolk Southern, the company won't attempt tooperate its trains.   Similarly, CSX Corp., Union Pacific Corp., Santa FePacific Corp., Consolidated Rail Corp. and BurlingtonNorthern Inc. said they would cease operations if anationwide strike is called.   A spokesman for Union Pacific cited safety reasons for thedecision. At CSX, a spokeswoman said it would takesupervisors three to five days just to clear the rails oftrains idled by a strike.   Labor leaders said the railroads appear to want to createthe type of emergency that would get Congress to swiftlyorder rail workers back to their jobs and adoptrecommendations made by January's presidential emergencyboard. Recommendations for changes in work rules, wages, andhealth and welfare issues generally are considered to benefitthe railroads, while rail unions call the proposed changes amajor setback.   &quot;It is obvious that the railroads want Congress to make asettlement for them instead of them negotiating one,&quot; saidFred A. Hardin, international president of the UnitedTransportation Union in Cleveland.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said the Bushadministration is ready to work with Congress on emergencylegislation &quot;to prevent economic devastation,&quot; which a railstrike could cause. The Associated Press reported that Mr.Skinner scheduled a meeting with the unions for today.   Mr. Skinner said, &quot;This country has just emerged from aseven-month conflict in the Mideast and the worst of therecession is, I believe, largely behind us. There is no goodreason for a crippling nationwide rail disruption, and thisadministration is committed to avoiding it.&quot;   The most bitter opposition to the emergency board'srecommendations comes from the operating unions, especiallythe UTU, where officials say the board report would meansizable cuts in pay and major crew reductions.</TEXT></DOC>
