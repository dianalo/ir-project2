When interest rates rise, thrifts have to pay higher rates tohold and attract deposits. The money they earn on theirvariable-rate mortgage loans also rises, but not as much or asquickly.   Each percentage point rise in interest rates will add about $6billion to the cost of the Sandamp;L bailout, according to estimates bySNL Securities of Hoboken, N.J.   That estimate includes the higher rates the government will haveto pay on the bonds it plans to issue to fund the bailouts.   The estimate does not include the likelihood that higher rateswill push more Sandamp;Ls into insolvency, the firm says. Thrifts withmore red ink on their books also will cost more to bail out.   ``Taxpayers will foot a much larger proportion of the bill thanwhat's being announced. It may be double, even,'' said Jim Marks,publisher of SNL Quarterly Thrift Digest.   Yields on three-month Treasury bills _ an alternative to Sandamp;Lcertificates of deposit for big investors _ have shot up to 8.8percent from 5.6 percent a year ago.   Edward J. Kane, a professor at Arizona State University, saidMonday that according to a stricter accounting standard than the oneused by the government, 750 thrifts were insolvent by lastSeptember. Since then, rising interest rates have helped pushanother 50 to 100 into their ranks, he said.   Higher interest rates have caused a hemorrhage of thriftdeposits. Net deposit withdrawals rose in December to a record ofmore than $8 billion, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday.Total deposits were about $972 billion.   Some thrifts have concluded it is not financially worthwhile toraise their rates on deposits high enough to keep all theirdepositors.   With fewer deposits, the thrifts have less money available tomake new mortgage loans, but they would rather shrink and remainprofitable.   Because deposits are counted as liabilities on the books, thriftscan actually improve their net worth by allowing deposits to bleedaway, said Edwin Gray, president of Chase Federal Bank in Miami andformer chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.   A silver lining in the Sandamp;L crisis is that thrifts are somewhatbetter prepared to cope with high interest rates now than they werein the early 1980s, the last time interest rates soared. Mostmortgages in their portfolios have adjustable rates, so mortgagepayments rise when rates rise.   In September 1981, only about 29 percent of thrifts' mortgageshad adjustable rates. As of this past September, the proportion was74 percent, according to James Barth, chief economist of the FederalHome Loan Bank Board.   Stuck with fixed-rate mortgages and soaring short-term interestrates, 85 percent of thrifts were unprofitable in 1981, Barth said.As of September, the proportion of unprofitable thrifts was 30percent, he said.   Some thrifts also have taken steps to protect themselves frominterest-rate fluctuations by raising some of their money throughissuing bonds instead of taking in deposits.   When interest rates rise, the thrifts don't have to raisepayments on their bonds, while they do have to raise payments ontheir deposits. As of last September, about 11 percent of thrifts'capital came from borrowings such as bond issues, up from 3 percentin 1980, Barth said.   Troubled thrifts have a harder time using such defensivestrategies. It costs more for them to issue bonds and they have tohave them fully backed with collateral.   Also, troubled thrifts cannot easily afford to offer theincentives that would cause customers to choose adjustable-ratemortgages instead of fixed-rate mortgages, Gray said.   Troubled institutions, which have the highest proportion ofmortgage loans that aren't being paid, are squeezed the worst byrising rates. Their cost of funds is rising along with everyoneelse's but they have less of an offsetting gain on their loanportfolios.</TEXT></DOC>
