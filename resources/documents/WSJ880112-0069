But chemical makers largely are resisting.    Burnt by early-1980s problems of excess capacity, a stagnant market and poor profit margins, chemical manufacturers shed plants and products drastically until about two years ago, when the restructuring began to show modest profits. Now companies have entered a holding pattern -- cautiously finding ways to increase output with minor adjustments, expanding specialty lines where they have little competition, and beginning to diversify into related products.    Though the industry is expected to boost capital spending 14% this year, only about one-third of that increase is marked for physical expansion -- considered normal growth but insufficient to meet projected demand, analysts say. Meanwhile, the recent jump in export demand has brought the lure of bigger profits, if the companies were willing to build new plants or aggressively expand existing facilities.    &quot;It's a tough balancing act,&quot; says Myron Foveaux, the chief economist for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the industry trade group. &quot;You don't want to repeat past mistakes, but you live with the fear that if you don't (expand), somebody else will.&quot;    Chemical companies' gun-shy reaction to this temptation, especially as they do have the money to undertake massive capital expenditures, is typical of many other industries that produce tradable goods -- products that can be exported -- from paper and aluminum to components. Some of these companies, worried that the dollar could reverse direction and that the economy's strength could wane, are forgoing some profits by refusing to add workers to meet current demand.    David Hale, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, believes &quot;corporate anorexia&quot; has swept through American industries fearful of a recession and mindful of their experiences in the last boom. He frets that industry's failure to plow profits back into new capacity will constrain exports, considered by many economists as the brightest hope for maintaining U.S. growth, even if consumer spending weakens.    Mr. Hale believes that the tradable goods industry's outlook for this year and next &quot;will be good, because the dollar should stay weak.&quot; But, &quot;You aren't going to have higher capacity,&quot; he says. &quot;Instead, companies will balance demand with higher prices.&quot; That strategy may bode higher short-term profits. But it also passes up an opportunity for the U.S. to boost its export market share and improve its international competitiveness, economists say.    The chemical industry, which expects some of the sharpest increases in demand among export industries, illustrates the caution with which companies view the boom created by the weak dollar. Though most of these companies are flush with cash and highly profitable, and could afford to reinvest in costly new products and plant expansions, their success has made them acquisition targets -- which also makes them wary of expanding capacity.    Chemical makers worry that the dollar -- down 51% from its February 1985 high against the Japanese yen -- could just as easily snap back, eroding both their competitive advantage and gains on currency translations. They also worry that petroleum prices -- ever hostage to Middle East politics -- could rise again, slowing industrial demand and trimming profits.    &quot;Today's environment is quite attractive,&quot; says Dave Sliney, vice president, marketing, for Monsanto Corp.'s chemicals business. &quot;But it is an environment that can change quickly. To draw a business strategy on the fall of the dollar will be folly.&quot; Mr. Sliney believes the industry probably would rush to expand capacity, were it not haunted by the pell-mell plant expansion of the late 1970s and early '80s that left companies operating at 60% to 65% of capacity. &quot;This is a period of testing the willpower of American industry,&quot; he says.    &quot;We're conscious of our memories,&quot; says H. William Lichtenberger, president of the chemical and plastics division of Union Carbide Corp., which derives a third of its sales from overseas markets. &quot;We're trying very hard not to be mesmerized by the (export) opportunities.&quot;    Nevertheless, chemical manufacturers can't ignore the growth projections. The industry estimates that it shipped $215 billion of products last year, of which $26 billion were exports. Last year's sales rose 8% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.7% annual growth rate over the past five years. &quot;It takes a year before you start to see the benefits of a weak currency. Then in successive years, they get bigger,&quot; says Leo McGinnis, the manager of international economics at Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del. &quot;At some point, you have to decide to either expand or forgo market shares. When? That's a real tough one.&quot;    For now, the companies are doing the most obvious thing: squeezing out extra production here and there, a process they call &quot;debottlenecking.&quot; It essentially involves installing more efficient equipment and machinery -- without increasing the physical plant -- to increase output. Dow Chemical Co., for example, is getting extra production by replacing pneumatic and hydraulic controls in plants with computer controls and other advanced instruments.    In some Dow Chemical plants, the pumps and receiving vessels are capable of handling more volume than that of devices where chemical reactions occur. So it is simply a matter of switching to bigger reactors. &quot;These are the imaginative things (plant managers) are doing,&quot; says Bernard Butcher, a vice president of the Midland, Mich.-based chemical company. &quot;These incremental expansions don't cost much and you don't have to be thinking in terms of three years from now&quot; as would be the case with a new plant.    Still, Dow Chemical -- which, like other chemical companies, has posted sharp price increases and eliminated special discounts for premium customers -- can't meet all the demand and is turning away certain occasional customers. &quot;We could sell more if we had the production,&quot; Mr. Butcher says.    Chemical companies are particularly shy of adding new capacity for petrochemicals and other commodity products, an international market that low-cost producers such as Singapore and Brazil are entering in force. The only exception is Phillips Petroleum Co., which has announced a new plant for ethylene, a basic building block for petrochemicals, that would increase the company's capacity for the product 30% by 1990. But Robert Wallace, president of the company's chemicals unit, says the investment risk is &quot;low to moderate,&quot; because Phillips has secured &quot;long-term commitments from customers&quot; for part of the plant's output.    Most companies instead are spending significant sums expanding specialty chemicals, products for which they either have a market niche or own proprietary technology. Monsanto, for example, has undertaken a major expansion of facilities producing thermoplastic, a product that combines the qualities of rubber and plastic, in Brazil, Japan and Europe. It also is spending aggressively on biotechnology. Union Carbide is expanding capacity for the production of coating chemicals for magnetic tapes. &quot;We're looking at what things we are good at and where we have a technological advantage, and that's where we're investing to grow,&quot; says Carbide's Mr. Lichtenberger.    A few analysts believe that, despite the companies' current restraint, they may yet scurry to build new plants. &quot;They have a lot of cash,&quot; says Robert S. Reitzes, an analyst with Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co. &quot;I think they have been frightened by the stock market crash.&quot;    But the consensus expectation is that most cash-rich companies will aim to expand through mergers and acquisitions into related areas such as pharmaceuticals and consumer products -- as Dow Chemical and American Cyanamid Co. have already done. &quot;Some companies have decided to grow out of the chemical business,&quot; Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says. &quot;In the long run, you don't see the kind of growth there used to be in chemicals.&quot;    As the companies ponder possible uses for their cash, their strong balance sheets and lower stock prices since the Oct. 19 market crash have made them vulnerable to takeovers. &quot;Some of them realize that they are easy targets,&quot; says Mr. Reitzes of Mabon Nugent. Analysts also note that many chemical makers began buying back shares long before the crash and have since accelerated their buy-backs as a defense against takeovers.    Meanwhile, expansion and investment plans languish on the drawing boards. &quot;You can defer for six months,&quot; Mr. Reitzes says. &quot;Why commit to something when you aren't sure what the economy is going to be like?&quot;    &quot;Sure, the companies overbuilt last time around,&quot; he says. &quot;And they are behaving like alcoholics who swear that they won't take another drink. But if all they have left is beer and no water, they will start to drink beer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
