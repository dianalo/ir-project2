YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The owner of a closed Texas savings and loan institution charged that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board acted improperly by taking control of the thrift.    In a suit filed in federal court here, Thomas Gaubert, majority shareholder of Irving-based Independent American Savings Association, asked that the Bank Board be ordered to return the thrift's assets and that the court award &quot;other equitable relief.&quot; Mr. Gaubert requested a jury trial.    The Bank Board declared Independent American insolvent on May 20 and transferred its operations to a newly chartered thrift, which had a six-member board installed by the Bank Board. Earlier the same day, Mr. Gaubert had filed a $550 million administrative claim against the Bank Board over his removal as an officer of the thrift by regulators. That claim is currently being considered, Bank Board officials said.    The Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas removed Mr. Gaubert as chief executive officer of the thrift in 1984 and installed directors of its own choosing in 1986. Mr. Gaubert's suit claims that those officers &quot;totally mismanaged and looted&quot; the thrift. Further, the suit charges that the Bank Board &quot;coerced the Texas state banking officials to close&quot; Independent American, even though Mr. Gaubert claims it wasn't insolvent.    Bank Board officials said they had no comment on the suit.    In an unusual turn of events in January, Mr. Gaubert and other shareholders and former officers voted themselves back into control of the thrift, defeating the officers selected by the Dallas bank last year. Mr. Gaubert currently isn't an officer or director of Independent American.    Mr. Gaubert is a major fund-raiser for Democratic candidates nationwide and is the former national finance chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </TEXT></DOC>
