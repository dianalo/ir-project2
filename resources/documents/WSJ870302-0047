But Wall Street sources said Purolator had considered other proposals, and they didn't rule out the possibility of a higher bid by another transport company.    Over the weekend, Purolator directors endorsed the $35-a-share bid by PC Acquisition Inc., owned by eight Purolator executives and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc., a subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc.    Hutton is to provide as much as $279 million in financing for the transaction. The offer is to begin no later than Thursday and end after 20 business days.    Purolator's stock price had risen sharply Thursday and again on Friday, after Purolator announced it was considering an offer. On Friday, Purolator shares closed at $35.125, up $3.375 for the day, in composite New York Stock Exchange Trading.    Julius Maldutis, a securities analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., put the value of Purolator's core business -- its surface transport network and its Indianapolis-based air courier service -- between $38 and $42 a share, or $289 million to $319 million. Purolator also makes automotive closure caps, but the troubled company has sold other businesses recently. Purolator, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., had a net loss of $57.6 million in 1986, wider than its 1985 deficit of $29.4 million.    Analysts had speculated that a takeover offer might come from one of three other potential buyers: DHL International Ltd., based in Hong Kong; TNT Ltd., an Australian concern; and Consolidated Freightways Inc., Palo Alto, Calif. None of those companies had any comment.    PC Acquisition intends to offer $35 a share in cash for as many as 83% of Purolator's shares outstanding. If more than 83% of Purolator's shares are tendered, holders will receive, on a pro-rata basis, $29 in cash and about $6 in 12%, 15-year debentures and warrants to buy 15% of the stock of a PC Acquisition subsidiary that would own Purolator's domestic operations. Purolator valued the package of debentures and warrants at $46 million.    The offer will be called off if fewer than two-thirds of Purolator's 7,650,000 shares are tendered.    William Taggart, chief executive officer of Purolator's U.S. courier division, would become chairman, president and chief executive officer of PC Acquisition. Mr. Taggart is also president and chief executive of Taggart International, the driver training-school operator. Al Fasola, president of the U.S. courier division, would become chief operating officer of PC Acquisition.    Purolator said C. Howard Hardesty Jr., now president and chief executive officer, isn't part of the PC Acquisition management group and presumably would leave Purolator.    Mr. Taggart said the buyout is &quot;excellent news for our shareholders, our customers and our employees . . . . Purolator management has a significant stake in this business, and we are committed to success.&quot;    Tony Robertson, an analyst at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore, said, &quot;I think the price sounds fair.&quot; He added that he has estimated the company's value at between $30 and $35 a share. Mr. Robertson said he doesn't expect other companies to enter the bidding, because Purolator, which is known to have been shopping the company for several months, &quot;has probably exhausted all their options.&quot;    &quot;Taken as a whole, the company is still losing money and the people who are buying it are taking a risk,&quot; Mr. Robertson said. &quot;Prices in the domestic courier business have been stable and Purolator couldn't improve its margins. If there is any price competition in the future, Purolator is going to have a more difficult time of being profitable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
