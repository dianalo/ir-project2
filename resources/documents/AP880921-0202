REPANSHEK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the three monthsYellowstone National Park has burned, firefighters have struggledheroically, politicians have pointed fingers and the park hasquietly gone about healing itself.   Just eight weeks after flames roared past the Grant Villagecomplex on Lake Yellowstone, wildflowers already have sprouted fromthe blackened soil.   By the time a blue-ribbon panel of experts convenes inmid-October to review the devastation and recommend arehabilitation plan, the seeds for recovery will have been sown _in some cases, by the very flames that have destroyed nearly halfthe park's 2.2 million acres.   ``The meadows, I would anticipate by next July you would noteven be able to tell that there was a fire there,'' said JohnVarley, the park's chief researcher. ``They respond that fast.   ``The areas of the forest that had a ground fire, but not acrown fire, it will be difficult to tell that they were burned,''he said. ``The areas that were totally consumed by fire will comeback and essentially be 100 percent plant cover in three to fiveyears. That 100 percent plant cover will be perennial grasses,wildflowers, the return of the shrubs, and willows and so forth.''   Also returning to the landscape will be lodgepole pines, whichalready are reseeding. The fires melted a protective resin coveringthe pine cones, allowing seeds to fall to the earth.   ``Fires have changed the face of Yellowstone this summer, butmuch has not changed,'' said Ed Lewis, executive director of theGreater Yellowstone Coalition. The group serves as a publicwatchdog over management of Yellowstone and neighboring nationalforests.   ``Elk, bison, bears and other wildlife species still roam thepark and the surrounding millions of acres of wildlands,'' he said.``Yellowstone's world-famous geysers still gush, whistle and roar,and Yellowstone's spectacular rivers and waterfalls still flow.''   Gone from Yellowstone will be many of the insect-killed treesthat littered the forest floor and fueled the fires.   While experts debate how to clean up the scorched landscape nowlittered with snags and ash, the insect world will be convertingthe timber into detritus.   ``They (the trees) are being attacked by insects _ right now,right this very moment _ that love freshly killed trees,'' Varleysaid, adding that they include termites, ants, beetles and otherspecies.   ``They are not, let me make this distinction, the same kinds ofinsects that attack live trees, so we are not serving as some kindof pestilence for the remaining live trees,'' he said. ``That willin turn bring in a host of bird species that feed on those kinds ofthings.   ``The bears spend a lot of time with ants and termites in thesefreshly dead and decaying trees, so there is a very interestingcomponent coming in there in the insect world that will feed a lotof animals, birds and so forth.''   The fires have spawned political controversy over the NationalPark Service's ``let it burn'' policy toward naturally ignitedfires. Wyoming Sens. Malcolm Wallop and Alan Simpson have calledfor Park Service director William Penn Mott's resignation over thehandling of the blazes.   But many observers say nothing in Yellowstone really wasdestroyed. They say the alterations are simply the park's latestgrowing pains.   No species have been driven from the park or tossed intoextinction by the fires, Varley points out.   He said the only real tragedy of the fires that charred morethan 1.5 million acres in Yellowstone and its surrounding nationalforests in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana was the destruction of somestructures and the economic hardships endured by some.   ``Ecologically, strictly ecologically speaking, there is reallyno downside to this story,'' Varley said. ``Where the downsidecomes in is when you talk about human values, values to life andproperty, and the very legitimate and sincere concerns that thepeople who are our neighbors have, and so forth.   ``This area has been putting up with fires like this for thelast 10,000 to 12,000 years, and it has adapted to be able to dealwith it,'' he said.   Many businessmen in the cities and towns surroundingYellowstone, while suffering through a dismal tourist season thisyear, actually expect the fires to spur a boom of sorts next year.   ``I think the park will have a lot of people out of curiosity,''said Dan Dowdy, who runs a campground and motel in Gardiner, Mont.,on the northern edge of Yellowstone.   Those visitors, as they make their way around the Grand Loopthat links Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and several campsitesand stopovers, will be able to pull over and watch the park menditself, said Varley.   ``We have in progress the development of an interpretive planthat will tell the visitor next year the story of the `Summer of'88.' I think it will be a fascinating story,'' he said. ``Thevisitor will be able to go into and look at these areas one yearpost-burning.   ``But then we have areas along the roadside that are 10 yearspost-burning, 35 years post-burning, 80 years, 100 years, and sothey'll be able to see this forest succession that is caused byfires,'' Varley said.   The tourists also can expect to find elk, moose, bears and bisonin many of the areas where they were before, he said.   ``The information that comes to us from the firefighters and allthe other people that are out in the field right now suggests thatthe animals are surprisingly nonchalant about the fires,'' saidVarley. ``We have numerous observations of elk bedded down inmeadows right next to where these great conflagrations are going on.   ``And we also have a lot of evidence that they move into theseblackened areas soon after the fire passes,'' he added.   There's really no reason to avoid Yellowstone in the years tocome, Lewis believes.   ``The reasons that people visit the park are still there andwill still be there next year,'' he said. ``The message is is thatYellowstone has changed but has not disappeared or died.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
