The Senate on Tuesday night heard six hours of testimony fromDefense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo, who denied oppositioncharges he is connected to foreign mercenaries trainingassassination squads for drug bosses.   Botero said the government was aware since late 1988 of rumorsthat Israeli and British military trainers were operating in theMagdalena Medio, a central mountainous region known as a haven forparamilitary groups and cocaine labs.   But he said he could not confirm the reports until Colombianmedia reported about them in April. Video tapes of civilians gettingexplosives training, shooting from moving cars and attacking houseswere sent to lawmakers.   ``The government never authorized or helped foreign mercenarygroups that came to Colombia,'' said Botero.   British Ambassador Richard Neilson told Colombian TV On Tuesdaynight, ``The government of Colombia had information about Britishmercenaries in Colombia in March and we were in a position to helpthem (the government).''   The special Senate session came after arrest warrants were issuedMonday for two Israelis, former army Col. Yair Klein and civilianArik Acek, accused of training assassination squads for drug lords.   The drug cartels have used the paramilitary groups againstleftist guerrillas, considered enemies of the traditionallyright-wing traffickers. The guerrillas often wage their battles inthe same regions drug lords have processing labs and hideouts.   Death squads are also believed to have been used in an internalwar between the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels, which compete tosmuggle drugs to the United States.   Interior Minister Orlando Vasquez Velasquez told senators heknows ``there is a massive infiltration of narco-traffickers in thegovernment, the armed forces, police and congress.''   Officials say 85 members of the army and national police havebeen dismissed this year and charged with wrongdoing, most foralleged links to cocaine merchants.   Criminal investigations director Omar Henry Velasco said Tuesdaythe government is in the process of producing proof of corruption inhigh echelons of society here.   A group of senators urged the government to make public a rumored``black list'' of politicians and journalists allegedly being paidby the drug cartels.   Many in Congress also allege the U.S. Embassy has a list ofpoliticians denied visas to the United States because of purportedties with traffickers. The embassy denies such a list exists but aU.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said manyColombians have been denied visas this year because of involvementin drug trafficking.   There was a lull Tuesday in the daily barrage of terroristbombings retaliating for the government crackdown. But policereported two Colombians fighting the cartels were killed Tuesday bygunmen.   Police said army Lt. Cesar Augusto Garcia was shot in arestaurant Tuesday in Medellin, hub of the cocaine cartel. A policeinspector in Puerto Parra also was reported shot in the back by twomen.   The deaths bring the toll to at least seven people killed sincePresident Virgilio Barco launched the drug war. Many more arebelieved to have been slain but it is difficult to differentiatebetween deaths connected to other criminal activity and thoserelated to the drug war.   Barco's action was triggered by the Aug. 18 assassination ofpopular presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, reportedly bygangs opposed to the senator's staunch anti-drug position.</TEXT></DOC>
