 Canada's telecommunications and softwareindustries are highly regarded in the world market.andP;  Canadianbusinesses also benefit from a general reputation for value andquality, augmented by good political relationships with most ofthe nations of the world.andP;  Analysts suggest that Eastern Europeoffers the greatest potential market for Canadian goods andservices, particularly those related to computer andcommunications technologies.andP;  In the 1990s, Canadian businessneeds to network through existing international structures such asCATA, ITAC and CADAPSO in order to maximize opportunities forglobal expansion..andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     International TradeStrategic PlanningCanadaBusiness PlanningCompetitionOutlook.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Playing in the global market means learning how to network is a mustandM;Working in the United States has its advantages.andP;  We see first hand how afree economy works.andP;  Second, we see entrepreneurial attitudes motivated byconfidence, success and business economics.andP;  The focus is on doing business.andO;Doing business depends upon the deal-and the deal can be domestic orinternational.andP;  After all, everyone understands English and wants our goodsand services, don't they?andM;Canadians aren't so sure.andP;  Returning home, I am sobered by the corporatereactions to an economy in recession, an unsure federal government andbusiness in doubt.andP;  Batten down the hatches, mothball the Mercedes, it's timeto watch our step and venture only on the familiar paths.andP;  All at a time whenopportunities for trade abroad are unparalleled.andM;New markets are burgeoning as the European community's 12 members statesamalgamate into a single integrated market; as Eastern European changes tocapitalism; as Canada's fence to the vast market of the United States isgradually dismantled by the Free Trade Agreement; as new markets mature inSoutheast Asia and the Pacific Rim; and, as developing countries morerealistically articulate their needs.andP;  By and large, Canadian companies arebeing beckoned from all over the world.andM;World class industryandM;Canada's telecommunications industry is well recognized as world class.andP;  Sois our software industry and our computer expertise.andM;To a large extent, our branch plant economy has contributed to the transferof technology from the United States and therefore to our benefit aspotential exporters of technical expertise.andP;  Examples abound of innovativeapplications of hardware and software - all of which makes Canada anattractive supplier to needy countries.andM;This, combined with our reputation for quality and value, our goodrelationship with most countries of the world, our good reputation generallyfor square dealing and our mostly political neutrality makes Canadiancompanies the preferred choice over many other countries as a supplier ofgoods and services or as a partner in a joint venture.andM;While the United States is our major trading partner, many believe thatEastern Europe offers Canada the greatest opportunities for selling goods andservices.andP;  In this regard, technology is ranked third behind manufacturedgoods and natural resources.andP;  At the same time, Canada's greatestinternational competition is seen to come from the United States and Japan,and Japan seems to be gaining in this respect.andM;Canada's venture capital market is small, and further, Canadian venturecapitalists don't seem to be comfortable with high technology.andP;  Consequently,Canada is hardly able to offer venture capital to international projects.andM;Skills lackingandM;Nor does Canada have the marketing skills and experience needed to succeed inthe international market.andP;  This has been attributed to our branch planteconomy in the high-tech industry where most of the key decisions are madeoutside Canada.andM;Canadian companies have to build global mandates focused on core productlines.andP;  For the most part, Canadian companies have chosen to diversifyhorizontally within the relatively secure and protected domestic marketplace.andM;Key factors that are perceived to hinder Canada's competitiveness are highwage rates, uncertain federal government policies, a lack of confidencegenerally, and reluctance to take risks.andM;Given that Canadians as a whole are not as entrepreneurial as foreigners andlack a domestic venture capital infrastructure, we must work harder to becompetitive.andP;  Unfortunatley, the larger and more successful Canadiancompanies get, the more conservative and conventional they tend to becomewith the result that much initiative is stifled.andP;  And in the light ofrecessive times, we resort to very conservative policies just when we shouldbe aggressively expanding.andM;With the economic domination of Germany and Japan, the prospects of aprotectionist Europe in 1992 and the evolution of three golbal tradingblocks, Canadians must take a pro-active stand just to keep even.andP;  Our FreeTrade Agreement has now allied Canada clearly with the U.S.andP;  in the NorthAmerican trading block and destroyed some of our imperial and honest brokerreputation.andP;  After all, Canada, the U.S.andP;  and Mexico represent some 360million consumers which is larger than the 326 million represented by theEuropean community.andM;Lack of interestandM;Recently there has been increased publicity about and encouragement forstrategic partnering by federal and provincial economic development offices.andO;However, much missionary work remains before tangible relationships can beexpected to develop.andP;  Few Canadian firms have demonstrated much interest and,with the exception of Northern Telecom (which is on the verge of acquiring100 percent of STC plc), Canada has few truly global high-tech firms.andP;  CognosInc. is another exception which comes to mind.andM;It's not clear to me that many Canadian companies have even thought about theprocess.andP;  Certainly, not many have formal plans nor have they paid muchattention to placing their people in positions to know.andM;One way for foreigners to gain access to the U.S.andP;  and some other markets isby acquiring Canadian companies.andP;  No one wants to see foreign domination oftheir domestic industries, yet this may happen in Canada if we are notcareful and limit foreign ownership.andM;By this, I do not mean limit ownership through legislation, but ratherthrough Canadian pride and desire to remain in control of the business thatwe have built.andM;As part of the Free Trade Agreement, the Canadian government has helpedforeign acquirers of Canadian companies by simplifying the government'sreview procedure.andP;  That's fine, but let's get full value and not sellcontrol.andM;Finally, there are many rivals hungry for this business.andP;  Whether Buffalo,Bangkok, Barcelona or Bulgaria, competition has never been tougher.andM;To take an organization with which I am familiar, IFIP (the InternationalFederation for Information Processing) exist to promote education,communication and co-operation among its 57 member countries.andP;  IFIP's work isdone through its technical committees which in turn oversee dozens of workinggroups each with the responsibility to communicate and to advance thestate-of-the-art in its specific field.andP;  technical committees cover theentire range of information processing and include programming, education,CAD/CAM, artificial intelligence, data communications, information systems,office automation, computers in society, VLSI and security -- to name a few.andM;As an IFIP member (and a founding one at that), Canadians can be appointed tothese committees where they can participate in their particular areas ofexpertise on a world scale in a scientific and non-competitive environment.andM;What better way to involve one' sorganization and open up opportunities tomeet peers on a one-on-one basis.andM;Further, these IFIP contacts go beyond the technical and scientific to seniorexecutives of both industry and government.andP;  Recently I was asked by a verysenior government official of an Eastern European country to &quot;bring me allthe computer hardware and software suppliers you can.&quot;andM;Of course, this request has to be tempered with the current state of certainexport restrictions, however, my point is that because these opportunitiesare initiated and sponsored at influential levels, they are much easier toconvert to business.andM;Equally important to the equation is the selection of appropriate Canadiansto sit on these technical committees an d working groups.andM;Above all, they must be recognized authorities in their field, shouldunderstand their Canadian/corporate environment and objectives, and be ableto recognize and identify opportunities so that they get appropriatehandling.andM;Not only may the recognize opportunities, but they may become aware at anearly stage of initiatives of foreigners which may impact Canada negatively.andO;This intelligence is very important.andM;In addition, as active participants in IFIP, we have the opportunity tosuggest new areas of work for technical committees and working groups moreappropriate to our expertise and capabilities.andP;  This is a powerfulcombination when used with care and commitment.andP;  We must nurture theseopportunites and take the greatest care to select individuals appropriate tothe task.andM;As the IFIP executive responsible for marketing my directions can positionCanada strategically in the forefront.andP;  Discussions are taking place now withthe European Commission over standards and other policies concerning trade.andO;Many present and former IFIP officers have been appointed to key positions intheir respective countries.andM;Know who to talk toandM;The days of jumping on a plane to chase and close a big deal in anothercountry are fast disappearing.andM;Knowing who to talk to and work with in that country is the prerequisite to asuccessful campaign.andP;  Managing these relationships is a high-maintenance jobthat requires well-matched personal contacts.andM;In the 1990s, business must maximize return on investment and the globalmarketplace offers too many opportunities for profit to ignore.andM;International connections take time to determine and to establish, but oncein place they produce business that otherwise might never have beenidentified or accommodated.andM;To play in the global market, Canadian firms are missing a beat if they don'ttap into the networks already existing.andP;  IFIP may not be the only game; other avenues may develop through organizations such as CATA, ITAC andCADAPSO.andM;To win we must pull out all the stops and participate actively at everylevel.andM;Jim Finch, CMC, ISP, is a Toronto-based management consultant specializing instrategic planning and computer security.andP;  He is a vice-president of theinternational Federation for Information Processing where he representsCanada on behalf of CIPS, and is a past-president of CIPS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
