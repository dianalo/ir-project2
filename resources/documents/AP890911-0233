Citing a recent New York State legislative report which chargedthat unnecessary hysterectomies are on the rise, Hoffman says that``women need to be transformed from passive, powerless victims intoinformed medical consumers, demanding minimum standards of behavior,information and treatment from their doctors.''   To increase what she terms ``patient power,'' she says women mustassert their right to question their doctors and not be intimidatedby the medical establishment. They need to find out their optionsfor treatment and be prepared to comparison shop for both doctorsand drugs. Then, with informed consent, they should take equalresponsibility with their doctors about treatment decisions.   ``It is not enough to know your rights. You must also accept yourresponsibilities.''</TEXT></DOC>
