The trouble began early Sunday when officials sent to arrestGov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo in the city of Tuguegarao were taken hostagein a hotel. Later, government forces stormed the hotel, leading toa series of clashes later in the day in the city. At least 10people were reported wounded.   Aguinaldo, a former lieutenant colonel, escaped, but officialssaid Sunday about 200 of his followers had surrendered.   The military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, placed thearmed forces on nationwide alert and ordered the military tocapture Aguinaldo ``at all costs.''   Scattered shooting was still reported late Sunday in Tuguegarao,capital of Cagayan province 250 miles north of Manila.   Col. Emiliano Templo told reporters Aguinaldo's followers werebelieved to be holding some people hostage in homes near the hotel.   However, Acting Gov. Melvin Vargas said 10 more Aguinaldofollowers surrendered early Monday and released about 30 hostagesthey were holding at a pawn shop. It was unclear if other hostageswere still being held.   Troops blocked a major bridge south of Tuguegarao, strandingthousands of travelers. Templo said Aguinaldo's followers includedhis private army, government militiamen and army Scout Rangers.   Marines were flown from Manila on Sunday to reinforce securityin Tuguegarao, a city of more than 80,000 people. PhilippineAirlines canceled flights to the city and schools were orderedclosed Monday.   In Manila, a homemade bomb exploded late Sunday in the Makatidistrict, but no injuries were reported and it was apparentlyunrelated to the fighting.   Local Governments Secretary Luis Santos and Brig. Gen. OscarFlorendo had gone to Tuguegarao to serve Aguinaldo with the arrestwarrant.   Before dawn, Aguinaldo's supporters surrounded the six-storyDelfino Hotel and took Florendo, chief of the military's civilrelations service, and three aides prisoner and trapped Santos andothers on the second floor.   About 3 p.m., government forces launched an attack. Florendo,51, was wounded during the rescue and was dead on arrival at a cityhospital, said defense spokeswoman Lourdes Ilustre.   Santos, two mayors, two colonels and a navy commodore wererescued unharmed, officials said.   Casualty figures were incomplete, but regional commander Col.Miguel Fontanilla said at least 14 people died.   They included 10 killed during a clash at a checkpoint near abridge, three in fighting near a gasoline station and Florendo atthe hotel, he said.   President Corazon Aquino said Florendo ``was killed by one ofthe followers of suspended Gov. Rodolfo Aguinaldo .... The act ofcowardice and treachery of Aguinaldo's followers will not gounpunished.   ``I call on all our people to continue to reject violence anduphold our constitutional democracy and the processes of law in apeaceful manner.''   In a radio interview at the hotel earlier Sunday, Aguinaldo saidhe was a ``victim of injustice .... I don't mind dying as avillain.'' He threatened to take his followers into the mountainsand become ``a rebel.''   Aguinaldo was suspended in January as governor of Cagayanprovince for allegedly supporting the Dec. 1-9 military rebellionand had been holed up in his hometown of Gattaran, 45 miles northof Tuguegarao.   Aquinaldo told a Manila radio station on Dec. 1 that he wassending tanks and artillery to the city to support mutineers tryingto oust Mrs. Aquino.   The governor was indicted along with Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile andfive others in connection with the coup attempt, the sixth andbloodiest attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power in1986.   Enrile appeared in court Monday to face the charge of``rebellion with murder'' in connection with the failed coup. Butthe arraignment was put off until the Supreme Court decides whetherthe charge is valid. The court is to hear arguments Tuesday.   Aguinaldo was also implicated but never charged in a August 1987coup attempt. Later, he raised a private army, ostensibly to fightCommunist guerrillas. He ran for provincial governor in January1988 and was elected by a landslide. Aguinaldo was formerly theprovincial commander of Cagayan and many of the troopers assignedthere are believed loyal to him.</TEXT></DOC>
