Oracleanticipated the emphasis on connectivity among systems andsoftware but its products are still expensive.andP;  The desktopproducts are as yet insufficient to replace familiar DBMSs, aretruly portable only when all Oracle tools are used, and tendtoward the complexity of mainframe software.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Oracle Corp.

 Oracle's strengthsandM;compared to   's weaknessesandM;(fill in the blank with the name of your favorite database managementsystem).andP;  The most memorable ad might be an Oracle jet fighter shooting downa dBASE biplane.andP;  In fact, Oracle seems to have targeted Ashton-Tate forruthless attack.andP;  Who is Oracle, what do they have against Ashton-Tate, andmost important, what does Oracle have to offer database developers?andM;One thing Oracle has is size.andP;  When Editor-in-Chief David Kalman and Ivisited Oracle's California home between San Francisco and San Jose, we foundit scattered across multiple sites in adjacent cities.andP;  On the shores of SanFrancisco Bay, gleaming emerald towers under construction marked the newestOracle headquarters.andP;  When a company can devote 38,000 square feet to anemployee gym, you know something's up.andP;  Besides, Oracle's dramatic newoffices are just off Twin Dolphin Dr. (this was the former site of MarineWorld/Africa USA) on a new street called Oracle Parkway!andP;  (The town willremain Redwood City.)andM;Actually, evidence of Oracle's size is easy to discover.andP;  Just say hello toan Oracle person.andP;  Somewhere in the first minute the words &quot;billion dollarcompany&quot; will pop out.andP;  Oracle is not yet a billion dollar company, but bythe end of 1990 they intend to be.andP;  Oracle has doubled in size in 11 of thepast 12 years.andP;  To Oracle, sales growth, size, and success are everything.andO;Perhaps going for the gold is the great motivator.andP;  If everyone in thecompany lives and breathes success, they're less likely to be distracted.andO;Oracle is already the largest database software company around when you talkabout sales volume, and almost the largest software company in the world.andM;Of course, if greater size automatically led to superior design andimplementation, McDonald's would make the best hamburger on earth.andP;  A Big Macmay be a serviceable meal, but it isn't the best.andP;  Yet it's often the bestavailable, and a lot better than nothing.andP;  Comparing Oracle to McDonald'sisn't that far-fetched.andP;  Both are ubiquitous; you can find a Quarter-pounderalmost anywhere in the world, and Oracle has a database product for justabout every computer made.andP;  McDonald's can't make the ultimate hamburgerbecause they're committed to serving it everywhere.andP;  That can only be done byfinding a common denominator--which inevitably means compromise.andM;Computer hardware and operating systems are more diverse than Big Macmunchers, so compromise is evident in some of Oracle's products.andP;  They intendto fix that.andP;  While topping the billion dollar mark can come just from theirbig system software sales, the next major increment may require significantpenetration into the PC marketplace.andP;  Oracle calls their PC software,&quot;desktop products.&quot;andP;  Before looking at the details, let's draw the big Oraclepicture.andM;RootsandM;Oracle began in 1977 with a database manager for DEC's VAX minicomputer.andP;  Byoffering the first SQL implementation in a commercial relational DBMS, Oraclefilled a need.andP;  The key to their success was to fill an even bigger need.andO;While most other database software companies were happy to have a successfulproduct for a particular computer platform (hardware plus operating system),Oracle rolled their profits back into research and development.andP;  Theirstrategic plan was to build versions of their DBMS for other platforms--andeventually for all business computing environments.andP;  Peter Tierney, SeniorV.P., Product Division, describes it as &quot;providing a computing meta layer, alayer on a layer, independent of the platform.&quot;andP;  This move either caughtother software firms napping, they didn't have the wherewithal to do thesame, or they didn't see the value in it.andM;It was a risk.andP;  Connectivity wasn't the hot topic it is today.andP;  PerhapsOracle didn't have platform inter-operability in mind as a requirement.andO;Expanding their market from the VAX to other minis and mainframes was aprofitable move in itself.andP;  Looking back, Oracle did exactly the right thing.andO;By adapting their SQL-based products to multiple systems, Oracle was layingthe groundwork for today's major need.andM;Inter-operability is the ability to mix hardware and software and still haveit work.andP;  An IBM mainframe might be the best place to store customer data fora major bank.andP;  A DEC mini or an OS/2 PC might be used as a database server ineach branch for daily transactions.andP;  Users might need PC applications, orthey may prefer Macs.andP;  Systems might be connected by Novell NetWare,Microsoft LAN Manager, IBM Token Ring, Banyan Vines, UNIX/XENIX, or DecNet.andO;Data might be located on a PC, VAX, or mainframe running IBM's DB2.andP;  Oracle'sapproach makes it possible to tie these disparate pieces into a transparentlyintegrated system.andP;  All of the Oracle components aren't quite mature, but thepotential benefit is clearly vital to the technology strategies of largerorganizations.andM;ApplicationsandM;Though Oracle offers desktop products, the products aren't sufficient yet toreplace more familiar developer tools.andP;  In spite of the vivid image of Oracleshooting down dBASE, Oracle isn't an alternative.andP;  Developers using dBASE IV,Clipper, FoxPro, Paradox, or other advanced DOS tools won't find directsubstitutes from Oracle.andP;  This raises the obvious question.andP;  Why spend moneyto publicly attack a product you can't replace?andM;Edward Oates, Oracle's V.P., Desktop Products, draws an apples-to-orangespicture.andP;  &quot;dBASE is a language, not a DBMS.andP;  We support the dBASE languagevia dBXL and Quicksilver&quot; (called Oracle for dBASE and adapted to act asfront ends to Oracle's database server).andP;  The comparison fails because Oracleisn't a language.andP;  It's a database manager that must be talked to in SQL bysuitable front ends.andP;  Oracle &quot;applications&quot; are written in third-generationlanguages like C, COBOL, and FORTRAN.andP;  Oracle Corp. and third-partydevelopers offer data bridges to Oracle Server from Quicksilver, Clipper,Paradox, R:BASE, WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, 4th Dimension, Omnis 5, Access20/20, HyperCard, and other PC products.andP;  Bridges for FoxPro and dBASE IVaren't available.andP;  Ashton-Tate is expected to directly support Oracle Serverin dBASE IV Server Edition.andP;  Versions of DataEase, Clarion, Progress, Randamp;R forSQL, Paradox/SQL, and many others will do the same.andM;But using any PC-specific language or front end eliminates another ofOracle's important features--portability.andP;  Portability means flexibility.andO;You can write an application in its best development environment, then run iton its best execution platform.andP;  Or you can run the same application in amixed environment.andP;  An organization can invest in developing an applicationwith some assurance that an equipment upgrade won't make it obsolete.andO;Developers can sell the same application for many different systems.andP;  Thisportability is only possible if development is done exclusively with Oracle'stools.andP;  An all-Oracle application will run virtually unchanged on more than80 different computers and operating systems, including workstations, minis,and mainframes.andP;  Data on Oracle Server is also portable among XENIX, OS/2,VAX, and mainframe platforms.andP;  At the PC level, Oracle claims their serverhas significant design and support advantages over IBM's Extended Editiondatabase and Microsoft's SQL Server.andM;ToolsandM;Oracle offers several 4GL application tools.andP;  They apply the term 4GL orfourth-generation language to products that don't rely exclusively onprocedural language programming.andP;  3GLs like dBASE or COBOL require detailedline-by-line programming to build screens, get input, figure out where thedatabase is, open it, open an index, locate a record, find additionalrecords, etc.andP;  An application built with Oracle's 4GL tools handles all thisinternally.andP;  The user makes a request by filling in a form and a SQL query issent to the appropriate database server.andM;Oracle's 4GL tools include the following: SQL*Forms, to interactively developforms-based applications without procedural programming; SQL*ReportWriter, anon-procedural report writer; SQL*Menu, to build user interfaces to Oracleand other applications; SQL*Plus, an ANSI-standard SQL query andadministration tool with some language extensions; SQL*Loader, a conversionutility that moves existing data into Oracle's format; and Pro*C, a Clanguage precompiler and subroutine call interface to integrate Oracle datainto other applications.andP;  All of these tools are bundled with eachsingle-user copy of the Oracle RDBMS, the Oracle Server SQL database engine,known as &quot;Professional Oracle.&quot;andP;  The DOS version 5.1B sells for $1,299.andP;  Youcan use a $199 limited trial version of Professional Oracle to developapplications.andP;  When a shared database server is needed, Oracle Server forOS/2 is $2,499, $699 for the developer's version.andP;  And Oracle Server forXENIX 286 is $2,495.andP;  (All prices are for PC versions.andP;  Large systemssoftware costs considerably more.)andM;Oracle offers lots of other products for building complex systems.andP;  SQL*Netis the $299 networking software required to access remote Oracle databases onPCs, minicomputers, and mainframes with DECnet (VAX) or TCP/IP (UNIX).andP;  Itsupports distributed processing and distributed databases to connect anapplication client to Oracle Server.andP;  Oracle for 1-2-3 ($299) lets usersretrieve data from Oracle's RDBMS, IBM's DB2, and SQL/DS and move it directlyinto Lotus worksheets.andP;  Oracle for dBASE ($699) provides dBASE III PLUSprogrammers with a procedural front end to Oracle Server.andP;  SQL*QMX ($299) isa variation on IBM's QMF that lets users make direct Query-By-Example (QBE)or SQL queries of the database.andP;  SQL*Calc ($299) is a Lotus-like spreadsheetthat runs on all Oracle platforms.andP;  Oracle sells &quot;programmatic interfaces&quot;for C, COBOL, and FORTRAN at $395 each.andP;  CASE*Dictionary, which managescomputer-aided systems engineering (CASE) is $2,999.andP;  Oracle for Macintoshallows HyperCard scripts to access Oracle Server ($299 developer's version,$999 network version).andM;The main problem with Oracle's 4GL tools is that computers aren't yet readyfor program-less programs.andP;  Some situations require procedural programming.andO;Oracle's solution is PL*SQL, a procedural language that can be embedded inSQL*Forms.andP;  Based loosely on ADA (the Department of Defense's developmentlanguage), the next-generation of PL*SQL (version 6) combined with the nextSQL*Forms (version 3) will provide the needed flexibility.andP;  With variable andlooping control, procedures can be stored in the database or application.andO;The integrated language allows a procedure to be executed in the best place,be it the application form or database manager.andM;SQL*Forms 3 will also isolate the functional engine from the object-orientedpresentation layer (the user interface).andP;  This will lead to support forgraphical interfaces, where the same code takes on an appearance appropriateto the workstation's graphics abilities.andP;  Oracle hopes to make hardwareirrelevant.andP;  By providing efficient data sharing with client/serverarchitecture, Oracle will be &quot;scalable.&quot;andP;  It can grow with the company.andP;  Afirm won't have to change software, just reinstall it on a new platform.andO;According to Marc Benioff, Director, Desktop Products, &quot;Oracle removes theneed to figure out which platforms, operating systems, and workstations willsurvive.andP;  Oracle supports them all with the same code.&quot;andM;For PC developers, Oracle offers database management power not available inproducts that originated on microcomputers.andP;  Ed Oates calls it &quot;mainframequality moved to desktop systems.andP;  The Oracle database manager knows aboutdata contention, concurrency, security, and ANSI-standard SQL.&quot;andP;  However,mainframe software like Oracle can be intimidating.andP;  It's both more complexand more obscure than PC software.andP;  The ideal situation may be to developapplications in the friendly PC environment, then access data stored inOracle Server &quot;wherever it is,&quot; which might be on hardware the developer neednot see nor use.andM;Though tackling Oracle development requires a major commitment, thedevelopment business has a great future for those who can hack it (punintended).andP;  Oracle sells some accounting application &quot;financial tools,&quot; suchas general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and payroll,written using SQL*Forms.andP;  These can be tailored to vertical markets.andP;  Isn'tthis direct competition with Oracle developers?andP;  Citing over 600 firmswriting applications in Oracle, Benioff says &quot;the application marketplace ishuge--multi-billions of dollars.andP;  We can't supply all the applications to allthe people.&quot;andP;  Oates adds, &quot;The applications backlog is huge.andP;  There are manyyears of crying need for targeted applications.andP;  Our applications software isnew and not yet a major activity.&quot;andM;Oracle and VARsandM;Oracle does more than acknowledge the need for independent developers.andP;  Theyhave a value-added reseller support organization that lets major VARs hookinto Oracle's sales force, perhaps the largest in the software industry.andP;  &quot;Wework with VARs to develop applications, and to close deals,&quot; says Oates.andM;A developer who looked into working with Oracle a year ago needs to lookagain, according to Tom Siebel, Group V.P.andP;  and General Manager of Oracle'sDirect Marketing Division.andP;  &quot;We've changed our approach to VARs.andP;  We used tobe oriented to minicomputer and IBM 370-type VARs.andP;  In the past, someone hadto make a huge commitment to Oracle to be a reseller.andP;  Today, a VAR can beauthorized without a cash commitment.andP;  Oracle has changed, moving deeply intosmall systems.andP;  We're the largest vendor by far in UNIX, and rising quicklyin the PC market.&quot;andM;Siebel says his is the fastest growing unit at Oracle Corp. (from $11 millionin sales in 1987 to a forecasted $135 million in 1990).andP;  Oracle will do anestimated $100 million in VAR business this year, a tenth of their totalrevenue and 20 percent of their U.S.andP;  sales.andP;  That makes VARs important.andO;Oracle VARs range from ATandamp;T and very large Fortune 10 firms, which often useOracle inside other products, to small development shops in the PC world.andM;Oracle has a comprehensive field organization, divided into groups andsubgroups, to serve geographic regions, industry sectors, the federalgovernment, and different types of resellers.andP;  The field groups handle onlylarge purchasers who've made a very serious commitment to Oracle.andP;  The DirectMarketing Division is a parallel organization, also divided into groups andsubgroups, which handles VARs and users when the investment in Oracle is lessthan $65,000.andP;  About 200 professionals work with customers, primarily bytelephone, to analyze problems and recommend solutions.andP;  This group handlesover 20,000 sales calls per week.andM;The VAR Direct group provides sales, support, and reseller authorization tosmaller application developers who want to use Oracle as an engine forPC-based, UNIX-based, or workstation-based applications.andP;  Oracle divides VARdevelopers into three categories: systems integrators, applicationdevelopers, and consultants.andP;  Anyone can buy Oracle, but a developer mustbecome authorized to resell it.andM;An Oracle Preferred Systems Integrator (SI) adds value by integratinghardware and software components into systems.andP;  Oracle salespeople spendconsiderable time developing relationships with these integrators--and withtheir distributors.andP;  SIs are a very large class of Oracle VAR.andP;  Breaking withtradition, smaller integrators can now buy Oracle from distributors.andP;  Verylarge SIs enjoy a long-term, direct relationship with Oracle.andP;  Somedistributors and large SIs even have full-time Oracle support people on site.andM;An Application Development VAR who wants to embed Oracle in a generalcirculation product can buy a development license, then cheaper runtimelicenses to distribute with packaged applications.andP;  The user doesn't need tobuy Oracle.andP;  Authorization and licenses are provided for a specificapplication only.andP;  Oracle doesn't offer a general-purpose runtimedistribution license.andM;An Oracle Consultant is a developer who uses Oracle in custom applications.andO;The consultant purchases a development license.andP;  To run the application, theconsultant or user must purchase another full version of Oracle plus networknodes.andP;  Runtime isn't available in this context.andM;You may have noticed that it costs to enter the Oracle world.andP;  An Oracledeveloper will be happiest with a high-performance 386 with 4M of memory.andP;  Amicro-based Oracle Server must run OS/2 or UNIX, which have similar hardwarerequirements.andP;  The software costs add up fast.andP;  Siebel admits that &quot;Oracle isa premium-priced product on any platform.&quot;andP;  In defense, he claims, &quot;Oraclehas become dominant in markets such as UNIX where cheaper competitors werealready successful.andP;  The market has voted that the value of Oracle technologywas worth it.andP;  The trend in software is for the cost component to increase.andO;Companies that aren't engaging in value-based pricing for software will ceaseto exist.&quot;andM;Siebel thinks that for VARs providing applications in the Fortune 1000marketplace, Oracle is the only game in town.andP;  For smaller firms, he admitsOracle is not yet a cost-effective solution.andP;  On the other hand, for agrowing firm, Siebel assures, &quot;It can be safer to start with Oracle.andP;  It willbe there as they migrate to larger systems.&quot;andP;  Even though Oracle runs on thelargest platforms, Siebel says the typical Oracle system is five to 10 users.andO;&quot;We don't see price resistance in the smaller market.andP;  People should bemaking investments in technology that will allow them to move into much moresophisticated systems, such as voice and image processing.andP;  Information is astrategic business issue.andP;  Oracle says [to the customer] all networks, alloperating systems, all computers are the same.andP;  We allow a corporation topick systems as tactical decisions.andP;  This gives them great flexibility.&quot;andM;In a world of vaporware, Oracle has the resources to produce realproducts--at least if money buys success.andP;  Siebel pegs Oracle's Research andDevelopment budget at $200 million, bigger than the entire revenue of mostother database firms.andP;  Though it has the money to buy products and entirecompanies, Oracle develops its own software.andP;  Oracle's programming armyconsists of huge numbers of computer science graduates with 4.0 GPAsrecruited from MIT, Cal Tech, and Stanford.andM;Learning OracleandM;Mastering Oracle isn't easy.andP;  Siebel calls it &quot;a complex mainframe databasesystem with 13 volumes of documentation.andP;  Functionally, it's the most complexmanufactured today.andP;  Oracle is designed for building unlimited applicationsto concurrently access large volumes of data and perform complex backgroundtasks.andP;  It's not the best choice for building mailing list systems.andP;  Oraclerequires an investment in technology and may be unusable without training (inthe form of books and Oracle courses).andP;  It's not the kind of product you takehome and spend a few evenings with.&quot;andM;One new user, an in-house mainframe developer for one of the largest oilcompanies, found Oracle challenging.andP;  &quot;The learning curve was steep.andP;  Theconcept of triggers firing at different levels (field/block/form) took timeto understand.andP;  We had to learn new concepts.&quot;andP;  How was Oracle mastered?andO;&quot;Some of our team took Oracle classes and came back with manuals.andP;  Theyhelped the rest of the team go through the self-paced lessons.&quot;andM;For the planned application, Oracle was established as superior to both Nomadon the mainframe and Paradox on the PC.andP;  According to the programmer, &quot;Welooked at Paradox, and realized file server technology wouldn't work.andP;  Oraclegives client/server technology with performance and locking.andP;  We initiallystarted developing in Paradox and found it couldn't handle the job.andP;  Webrought up our first Oracle application in three months with three peopleworking on it.andP;  Our alternative was Nomad on the mainframe, which would havetaken much more time and system cost.&quot;andP;  (Ironically, Borland will soon ship aversion of Paradox that works as an Oracle client or front-end application.)andM;Oracle didn't turn out to be perfect either.andP;  The developer explains, &quot;Oraclestill looks like a mainframe screen, without lots of colors.andP;  The nextrelease of SQL*Forms will enhance the screen interface and colorcapabilities.andP;  SQL*Forms 2.3 with the Oracle 5 kernel is a step backwardsfrom procedural language programming.andP;  The coming version 6 kernel withversion 3 forms will be better for application development, since it'll havemore procedural language capabilities.andP;  A Mac on the network can't run the PCversion of SQL*Forms.andP;  The next version of Forms should make the machineinvisible (Oracle Forms does shield you from SQL).andP;  To use the report writerrequires that you know SQL well.andP;  Oracle provides SQL*Plus, which is morethan SQL and helps.andP;  The report writer isn't very good, but it will beenhanced in the next version.andP;  Oracle has been very responsive to ourconcerns.andP;  Overall we're pretty happy.&quot;andM;Oracle tomorrowandM;The benefits of client/server architecture, wonderful in theory, can only berealized by application front ends that speak the server's language.andP;  Somedevelopers thinks only applications designed specifically as server frontends will make the grade--and we don't have them yet.andM;Siebel acknowledges that while Oracle is &quot;going towards having an applicationlevel that works with Oracle Server, we aren't there yet in areas like wordprocessing, spreadsheets, project management, etc.andP;  We want applicationssoftware to be Oracle-based to be compatible.andP;  We hope we won't have tocompete with other companies [that also have or plan to build servers].andP;  Wehope they'll become partners, leveraging success.&quot;andP;  Tierney points out thatpeople can use some of their current front ends now, such as Oracle fordBASE, Oracle for Lotus, and the Paradox bridge, and adopt Oracle as the backend.andP;  But there may be a long-term price to pay for front-end firms aligningwith Oracle.andP;  &quot;Oracle will eventually produce its own applications,&quot; admitsTierney.andP;  Companies that end up face-to-face with Oracle will have to offerbetter solutions.andM;And what about the public war against Ashton-Tate?andP;  If Oracle doesn't offer abetter dBASE (they don't), what do they hope to accomplish?andP;  &quot;We're competingwith Ashton-Tate only in the sense that they can bring dBASE into thecorporate environment,&quot; says Tierney.andP;  It turns out that Oracle isn'tbattling dBASE as it exists today.andP;  Ashton-Tate is ready to launch dBASEversions for UNIX and VAX platforms--Oracle's home turf.andP;  Oracle is defendingtheir future by building a case against Ashton-Tate's credibility andundermining a dBASE that hasn't even been released.andM;That's part of Oracle's style.andP;  They've been called aggressive and arrogant.andO;The people we met were bright and exceedingly confident, but we didn't seearrogance.andP;  On the other hand, Oracle people who talk about conquering thedesktop platform database world don't seem to understand its style.andP;  PC usersare a different breed from traditional computer professionals.andP;  We own oursystems and thrive on their openness.andP;  Public product evaluations areexpected.andP;  In contrast, the Oracle software license forbids publishingperformance measurements.andP;  It's extremely difficult to get users to talk onthe record (as we learned in the course of writing this story).andP;  Otherdatabase companies expect us to be involved in their developer and userconferences--Oracle bans the press.andP;  Does Oracle have something to hide?andO;Probably not.andP;  More likely, Oracle just doesn't appreciate the PC developer'sperspective.andP;  Maybe that's the A-word after all.andM;Being aggressive is something Oracle is proud of.andP;  It brings success.andP;  Thepeople at Oracle inject &quot;success&quot; into every discussion of VAR, consultant,and user benefit.andP;  According to Siebel, Oracle doesn't want to sell toresellers; they insist on selling through to users.andP;  Salespeople arecompensated the same whether a sale is made directly by Oracle or routedthrough a VAR.andP;  Whoever has the best chance of solving the problem shouldmake the sale.andP;  When Oracle succeeds, everyone succeeds.andM;Should you get into Oracle today?andP;  If your present or near-future platformsinclude UNIX, DEC, or mainframes, you probably should.andP;  If you're a PCdeveloper looking for the benefits of client/server architecture, today maybe too soon.andP;  Oracle's here, but the front-end tools and applicationsaren't--yet.andP;  1991 may turn out to be the year of The Great Server War.andP;  Witha billion dollars plus in revenue, Oracle may have all the ammunition itneeds.andM;John Hawkins is president of HawkTek Corp., a national computer andmanagement consulting database development and VAR firm, author of the comingbook FoxPro Programming, and Contributing Editor of Data Based Advisor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
