Joseph Antonini, chairman and president of the Troy,Mich., company, paid $582,350 for 14,000 shares in April, thefilings show. The purchase, in open-market transactions onApril 8 and April 19, was Mr. Antonini's biggest purchase ofcompany stock ever and his first purchase since the day afterthe 1987 stock-market crash, according to the filings.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Antonini owns options representing 387,500 shares, butchose to buy stock in the open market &quot;to set an example&quot; and&quot;to show confidence in the stock,&quot; he said in a telephoneinterview yesterday. &quot;All the strategies we've been workingon for the past three years are starting to pay off,&quot; hesaid.   While the purchase wasn't huge, given his annual salary ofalmost $1 million, Mr. Antonini said, &quot;I bought what I couldafford.&quot; And so far he has made a considerable paper profit.   Mr. Antonini purchased almost all of the shares at $41.63a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Kmartshares closed yesterday at $45.125. His shares have increasedin value more than $49,000. (Longer term, his 1987 purchaseshave also proved profitable: He paid an average share priceof about $30 a share on the day of the crash and the dayafter.)   For much of the late 1980s, Kmart lost market share torivals, such as Wal-Mart Stores, which were trouncing it withcheaper prices. But in early 1989, Kmart countered, slashingprices on about 8,000 health and beauty aids and consumerstaples, such as batteries, film and shampoo, while keepingprices competitive, but not dirt-cheap, on about 50,000 otheritems.   Now several Wall Street analysts say the company is in themidst of a turnaround that investors haven't fully noticed.Even though the stock's price has surged 60% since January,&quot;there's more in it,&quot; predicts Prudential Securities Co.analyst Wayne Hood.   David Poneman, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.,predicts Kmart will show &quot;better sales and earnings momentumthan many of its retailing peers over the next six to 12months.&quot; He expects the company's stock to outperform themarket as a whole, probably hitting the $48-to-$50-a-sharerange by year end.   &quot;In the first quarter, in which many fine retailers --Toys 'R' Us, Woolworth's, Penny's -- had earnings declines,&quot;said Mr. Poneman, &quot;Kmart had an increase.&quot; Kmart reported netincome of $107.5 million, or 53 cents a share, for thequarter ended May 1. That was up from $100.1 million, or 50cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 9% to$7.6 billion.   Not everything is rosy, analysts say. Sales are sluggishat the concern's bookstore chain, Waldenbooks; Wal-Mart isstill a serious competitor; and because of the recession,there is strong pressure on all apparel retailers to discountmerchandise.   Still, Mr. Antonini said he's &quot;more comfortable&quot; with thecompany's prospects than he has been in years. A $3 billionmodernization program will relocate or refurbish every Kmartstore to create &quot;wider aisles, better adjacencies ofmerchandise and quicker checkout,&quot; he said. Already, he said,it has produced &quot;increased sales and profitability&quot; atvirtually every store refurbished.   ---   SKEWED TO SELLING: Insiders are selling shares in theirown companies at near-record levels, filings with the SECshow. But people who track such filings carefully cautionagainst drawing excessively bearish conclusions.   While insider &quot;selling has been significant,&quot; many of thefilings cover transactions that should have been reportedmonths, even years, ago, said David Coleman, editor ofVickers Weekly Insider Report, a newsletter based inHuntington, N.Y. Those delinquent filings are essentially&quot;corrupting the data.&quot;   Late last month, the SEC was deluged with filings, asinsiders raced to beat a May 1 deadline for getting indelinquent reports.   Factoring out many of the older filings, the ratio ofinsider sells to buys is running at 2.56-to-1, said Mr.Coleman. Because insider sells normally outnumber buys2-to-1, the recent level is &quot;bearish, but not ominous,&quot; hesaid.   The most notable insider selling, according to RobertGabele, president of Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., companythat tracks and analyzes insider data, is going on in therestaurant, drugstore and retailing industries. &quot;These aregroups that are tied to consumers, and insiders seem to bewary of consumer spending habits,&quot; he said.   There also is very strong selling going on at computer andsoftware companies, and at health and medical supply firms,according to Invest/Net. But strong selling is typically morecommon in those industries than in others, because many ofthe firms are startups and executives are often compensatedin stock.   The industries bucking the insider-selling trend are banksand utilities, where insiders seem to be betting that lowerinterest rates will help their companies, said Mr. Gabele.</TEXT></DOC>
