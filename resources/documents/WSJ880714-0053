United Aviation Services Inc., an aircraft leasing firm in Uniondale, N.Y., said it signed a letter of commitment to purchase six Airbus A-300 aircraft from Eastern. The aircraft would be delivered between the end of August and mid-October.    In Miami, an Eastern spokesman confirmed that the carrier was in talks with United Aviation, but added, &quot;Any announcement is premature, because there is not a final signed agreement between the parties.&quot;    Eastern, a unit of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., has been on an aircraft sales spree recently to bolster its cash reserves, which totaled $561.3 million at the end of the first quarter. Eastern's number of aircraft has fallen to 271 from 284 at the end of last year. The company currently has 26 of the widebody A-300s.    Locked in labor contract talks, the company believes strong cash reserves are necessary to keep the airline flying in the event of a strike.    If Eastern plans to continue cutting back service, it isn't saying so. And it hasn't notified travel agents yet of its fall schedule, and probably won't until next week, one executive said.    Union negotiators have expressed concern that the carrier is shrinking jobs away, and the pilots, at least, have asked for assurances in their contract that the carrier wouldn't reduce its fleet to less than 270 aircraft. They also maintain it is foolish to sell the A-300s, which are among the newer and more fuel-efficient members of Eastern's aging fleet.    But at least one analyst thinks the sale makes sense from a business standpoint. &quot;They aren't using their equipment effectively,&quot; said Richard Bilotti, junk bond analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. To rid the fleet of the Airbus A-300s might lower costs by standardizing maintenance in favor of its mostly Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft.    Mr. Bilotti also believes selling off the larger A-300s might provide Eastern additional incentive to abandon overseas service, particularly in the Caribbean, which has grown more competitive since AMR Corp.'s American Airlines established a hub in San Juan, Puerto Rico. </TEXT></DOC>
