<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-0642 </DOCNO><TEXT>An analytic representation of the full Green's function including boundstates, resonances, and remaining contributions has been obtained fora class of dilatation analytic potentials, including the superimposedCoulomb potential. It is demonstrated how to obtain the locations andresidues of the poles of the Green's function as well as the associatedgeneralized spectral density. For a model potential which has a barrierand decreases exponentially at infinity we have found a certain deflationproperty of the generalized spectral density. A qualitative explanationof this phenomenon is suggested. This constitutes the motivation foran approximation that explicitly shows a decomposition of the (real)continuum, corresponding to scattering data, into resonances and backgroundcontributions. The present representation is also shown to incorporatethe appropriate pole-background interferences. Numerical residue stringsare computed and analyzed. Results for the Coulomb potential plus theabove-mentioned model potential are reported and compared with the previousnon-Coulomb case. A similar deflation effect is seen to occur, as wellas basically the same pole- and residue-string behavior. The relevanceof the present analysis in relation to recently planned experiments withelectron-cooled beams of highly charged ions is briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
