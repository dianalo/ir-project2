Alan Fiers, the former chief of the CIA's Central Americanoperations, admitted in federal court here that he withheldinformation from Congress about the Reagan administration'sthen-secret arms-for-hostages deals with Iran and about thediversion of proceeds from those sales to the NicaraguanContra rebels. Mr. Fiers also admitted that he withheldinformation about former White House aide Oliver North'sthen-secret efforts to provide the Contras with arms in themid-1980s, at a time when Congress had prohibited such aid.</LP><TEXT>   Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said that &quot;Mr. Fiers'splea of guilty and agreement to cooperate mark a significantadvance in our investigation.&quot; Mr. Walsh's 4 1/2-yearinvestigation into the Iran-Contra affair appeared to havebogged down in the past year, but the probe could bereinvigorated by the former CIA official's guilty pleas.   Mr. Fiers reported to the late CIA Director William Casey,whose precise role in the operations hasn't been determined.Mr. Fiers also had contact with then-Deputy Director RobertGates, whom President Bush has nominated to be CIA director.The Fiers pleas could provide ammunition to Senate Democratsduring Mr. Gates's confirmation hearings, which are expectedto begin this month.   Others about whom Mr. Fiers is expected to provideinformation to prosecutors include former Assistant Secretaryof State Elliott Abrams and Donald Gregg, the current U.S.ambassador to South Korea who was national security adviserto then-Vice President Bush in the mid-1980s. Messrs. Fiers,Abrams and North were the key members of a restrictedinteragency group that set Reagan administration policy onNicaragua.   Mr. Fiers's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said in an interviewthat his client &quot;will testify fully and truthfully.&quot; Thelawyer stressed that &quot;in no respect is George Bush spokenabout or implicated in any way. Nothing at all touched him.&quot;But Mr. Arkin wouldn't discuss the matter beyond that.   Mr. Bush's name has surfaced in the Iran-Contrainvestigation, in part because of the allegation that as vicepresident he helped circumvent Congress by securingassistance for the Contras from Honduras. Mr. Bush has deniedany impropriety, as have Messrs. Gates, Abrams and Gregg.   Another former CIA official apparently under scrutiny byprosecutors is Clair George. According to governmentdocuments filed with the court yesterday, Mr. Fiers in thelate summer of 1986 told Mr. George, then deputy CIA directorfor operations, that proceeds from the Iranian arms sales hadbeen diverted to the Contras. Mr. George later told Congressthat he hadn't learned about the diversion until November1986. The government documents state that Mr. Georgeinstructed Mr. Fiers not to discuss the diversion withCongress. They also say that two other unnamed senior CIAofficials knew about the diversion before it became public.   Mr. Fiers supervised Joseph Fernandez, who was the CIAstation chief in Costa Rica and worked closely with Mr. Northand others in the Contra military supply network. The CIA, incooperation with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, succeededin 1989 in blocking on national security grounds theprosecution of Mr. Fernandez.   A number of CIA officials, including Mr. Fernandez, havetestified recently before a federal grand jury supervised bylawyers from Mr. Walsh's office.   A 20-year CIA veteran who retired in 1988, Mr. Fiers, 52years old, faces a maximum sentence of two years in prisonand $200,000 in fines. Before his departure, the CIAreprimanded him for misleading Congress. A sentencing datehasn't been set.</TEXT></DOC>
