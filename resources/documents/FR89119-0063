L. 93-288,which were made by the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendmentsof 1988, Pub. L. 100-707. This legislation amended the Disaster ReliefAct of 1974, and retitled it the Robert T. Stafford Disaster and EmergencyAssistance Act (Stafford Act). However, given the lead time that will beneeded to deal with a notable change to the Public Assistance Program,advance notice for affected public and private non-profit entities is warranted.Section 406(d) of the Stafford Act contains a new provision intended topromote the purchase of flood insurance. If not heeded, it could resultin substantial reductions of Federal disaster assistance.The new flood insurance purchase requirement represents a major departurefrom FEMA's past approach to known flood hazards, which was governed bythe ``first bite free'' concept of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of1973, Pub. L. 93-234. The Flood Disaster Protection Act is silent on aproperty owner's obligation to purchase flood insurance for facilitiesin identified flood plains prior to seeking Federal assistance. Heretofore,there has been no penalty for a government or private non-profit entitywhich has chosen prior to the occurrence of a major disaster not to purchaseflood insurance for its facilities in special flood hazard areas. Suchgovernments or private non-profits have been able to wait for a major disasterdeclaration and the subsequent Federal assistance for the repair of itsfacilities before having to buy the insurance. This ``first bite free''arrangement is expressly eliminated by section 406(d) of the Stafford Act.Section 406(d) of the Stafford Act specifically addresses facilities whichare located in a special flood hazard area which has been identified formore than 1 year prior to a major disaster. It stipulates that where suchfacilities are damaged by flooding, the otherwise eligible Federal disasterassistance shall be reduced by the maximum amount of insurance proceedswhich would have been payable had they been fully covered. FEMA's interimregulations for the Amendments will state that a flood plain building andits contents must be fully covered, meaning that they must be protectedup to the value of the building and its contents or the maximum amountof flood insurance available under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy(SFIP), whichever is less. The SFIP is issued through the National FloodInsurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by FEMA pursuant to theNational Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 <T3>et seq.</T3>Section 406(d) of the Stafford Act becomes effective on May 22, 1989. Thatdate is 180 days after the November 23, 1988 effective date of Pub. L.100-707. Public and private non-profit entities with flood plain facilitiesare strongly urged to consider buying flood insurance before May 22, 1989,in order to protect against known flood hazards, and to avoid potentiallylarge reductions in future disaster assistance.Notice that the ``first bite free'' concept will no longer apply, and thatpublic and private non-profit entities will be expected to assume responsibilityprior to the occurrence of a major disaster for protecting those facilitiesexposed to known flood hazards, will be widely disseminated. Among othermeasures to be taken, special notices will be sent to the more than 17,000communities participating in the NFIP, letters will be sent to the stateemergency management directors, and a number of government associationswill be contacted. These types of notification are required by section406(d)(4) of the Stafford Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Alex Burns, Office of DisasterAssistance Programs, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Room 714, 500C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, Telephone (202) 646-3670.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Grant C.
