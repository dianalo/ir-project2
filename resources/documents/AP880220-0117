Japan recently offered to allow foreign participation in sixlarge public works projects, but U.S. officials said Saturday theproposals were not enough. The officials held an unusual weekendnews conference at the U.S. Embassy, but spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Michael Farren, deputy undersecretary of commerce forinternational trade, is heading the U.S. delegation.   The six projects are expansion of the Tokyo InternationalAirport at Haneda, construction of a new airport in Hiroshima, abridge across the Akashi strait near Osaka, a highway along IseBay, the development of a coastal area along the Tokyo Bay and workat Osaka Port.   ``A great many American firms have expressed tremendous interestin gaining access to Japanese markets,'' said one official. ``Butthe kind of things we called for in the way of constructionservices on this list would only open door to a very narrow rangeof American construction firms.   ``We've come to a judgement that the list (of the six projects)is not sufficient'' he said.   The officials said the talks will probably continue inWashington, where Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita met with U.S.leaders on an official visit last month.   Access to the Japanese construction market has been a majortrade issue in recent years between the two countries.   Japanese companies won about $2.3 billion in contracts in theUnited States in 1986, while U.S. firms did about $500 million inbusiness in Japan, according to construction officials.   Japan has opened only two semi-public projects to U.S. builders_ the Tokyo Bay bridge and the multi-billion dollar KansaiInternational Airport project.   The U.S. Congress last year passed legislation prohibitingforeign companies from taking part in U.S. public works projectsfor one year if their countries bar participation of U.S. firms intheir public works projects.</TEXT></DOC>
