(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The death toll from a shooting rampage ata printing plant rose to nine Monday with the death of a plantworker who was wounded. Four other victims were buried Monday.   Kenneth Fentress of Louisville died about 5 p.m. Monday, said aspokeswoman at Humana Hospital University. Fentress, 45, sufferedgunshot wounds to the chest and leg during last Thursday's rampage.   He was one of 13 wounded when Joseph T. Wesbecker sprayed theStandard Gravure Corp. printing plant with gunfire from an AK-47rifle. Wesbecker, who then killed himself, had been on permanentdisability leave from the plant for the past year because of mentalillness.   Meanwhile, two anti-gun organizations, hoping to mobilize agrassroots movement in the wake of the shootings, placed ads in astatewide newspaper Monday to enlist support to ban various weapons.   In a related development, the gun shop owner in Louisville whosold Wesbecker the AK-47 and a MAC-11 pistol said he has decided toquit ordering the semiautomatic weapons for customers.   ``The weapons are so controversial right now that we just don'twant to fool with them any longer,'' said Jack Tilford, owner ofTilford's Gun Sales.   President Bush has banned the import of foreign-made assaultrifles into the United States, including the AK-47. However,possession of these weapons is not a federal offense, nor does theimport ban prevent them from being manufactured domestically.   A full-page ad in The Courier-Journal from the Louisville Councilon Peacemaking and Religion called for the abolition of assaultweapons, saying ``there is no compelling reason'' to possess ``theseterrible instruments.''   Readers were asked to send the ad to U.S. Sens. Wendell Ford,D-Ky, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.   ``I'm deeply disturbed by the recent outbreaks of violence in ourstate, and believe we must take action to stop such viciouscrimes,'' McConnell said. But he added: ``We need to be carefulabout legislating in the middle of a crisis.''   McConnell referred to a police standoff Monday in which a17-year-old armed teen-ager held 11 classmates at a high school inMcKee. The boy later released the hostages and surrendered.   Ford will consider the group's views when gun-control legislationcomes before the full Senate, said his spokeswoman, Susan Elmendorf.   The Handgun Control Inc. placed an in the Louisville newspaperfeaturing Sarah Brady, wife of former presidential press secretaryJames Brady, who was critically injured in the attemptedassassination of President Reagan in 1981.   Funerals in the print shop shootings were held Monday for WilliamS. Ganote Sr., 46; Paul S. Sallee, 60; James G. ``Buck'' Husband,47; and Lloyd R. White, 42.</TEXT></DOC>
