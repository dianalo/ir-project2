But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to discusswhether the Marines would fight any intruding Iraqis.   ``Their instructions are the same as they've always been. Theyprovide security for the embassy building itself and the staff thatremains in it. There's no change in that,'' Fitzwater toldreporters here.   He turned aside several questions on whether the Marines' orderscould mean an outbreak of hostilities if the Iraqis forcibly try toclose down the embassy on Friday as they have ordered.   ``We don't want to get into any kind of speculation thatcomplicates or invites trouble,'' Fitzwater said.   ``Things are changing very rapidly. We are not trying to pindown specific instructions or any kind of pronouncement that mightcause problems or constitute threats.''   He said the non-essential embassy staff, reportedly numberingmore than half of the 120-member staff, were being transferred toBaghdad in hopes of arranging transportation for them out of thecountry from there.   Iraq, in attempt to solidify its occupation of Kuwait in theface of international opposition, ordered the Western embassiesclosed by Friday, as tension in the region remains high.   Fitzwater said Ambassador Nathaniel Howell will remain to assistother Americans who want to leave the Iraqi-controlled nation.There are an estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwait.   Fitzwater met with reporters a day after President Bush broughtthe Persian Gulf crisis into thousands of American homes byordering the nation's military reserves to active duty.   Officials say the order will take about 40,000 reservespecialists from their civilian jobs and put them in military poststo bolster the U.S. buildup.   Bush also said he was undecided whether to wait for UnitedNations backing before using force to sustain the trade embargoagainst Iraq.   The president, stressing the international condemnation ofIraq's occupation of neighboring Kuwait, left open the question ofwhether he would militarily enforce the trade embargo against Iraqwithout United Nations approval.   He told reporters his administration has ``all the authority weneed'' to intercept ships to enforce the U.N.-endorsed economicembargo. But he left a doubt about whether he would take suchaction.   ``At this juncture I'm not prepared to say whether we're goingto insist on U.N. action before we go further. But I think thesignal must go out to the world that many countries are prepared tofully enforce these sanctions,'' the president said.   Bush spoke to reporters after he met at his seaside home withDefense Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff, and Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger.   Bush today continued his Kennebunkport vacation, and tonightplanned to attend a fund-raising event for Republican David Emery'sMaine congressional campaign and New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg'sbid for re-election.   Bush's executive order calling up the reserves will result inactivation of prsonnel in specialized jobs including airlift, foodand water handling, surface transportation, cargo handling, medicalservices, construction and intelligence, the White House said.   Fitzwater said the call-up was not expected to involve the full200,000 reservists Bush may activate without getting congressionalapproval. However, the president did notify the leaders of theHouse and Senate that he was activating the nation's reserve forces.   Asked about reports that Jordan is letting goods be shipped intoIraq, Bush said, ``I'm not sure I know the total facts.''   Bush said Jordan's King Hussein, in a visit to Kennebunkportlast week, had assured him that he supported the economic embargo.But the monarch left unclear whether his country would allow foodor humanitarian supplies to cross the border.   Kuwait's ambassador to the United States accused Jordan onWednesday of collaborating with the Iraqis.   ``I don't think that the credibility of His Majesty King Husseinis any longer of any value,'' Sheikh Saud Nasir Al-Sabah told aWashington news conference after the monarch announced he wouldhold new talks with Arab leaders in an effort to defuse the crisis.   Meanwhile, the State Department said it now is advisingAmericans in Kuwait to ``plan their route carefully'' if they tryto flee the country overland despite orders to Iraqi forces toarrest anyone identified as a U.S. citizen. Previously, thedepartment had advised Americans not to try to leave Kuwait withoutpermission. About 500 Americans ignored the advice and got out.   Bush declined to answer when asked about a report that theSoviet Union still had 193 military advisers in Iraq despite theUnited Nations embargo Moscow has supported. ``At this point, Iwould say we are getting superb cooperation from the Soviets,'' hesaid.   Bush said he would encourage energy conservation in light of thePersian Gulf crisis. But he also said he would not give up rides inhis gas-guzzling speedboat Fidelity, and he said the oil supplysituation is not serious enough to keep people home from theirvacations.</TEXT></DOC>
