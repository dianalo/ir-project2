He was 71.   Swartz collapsed while standing in line at a ticket counter atthe Los Angeles airport Thursday, his longtime friend, DaveMcIntyre, said Monday.   As Swartz wished, his body will be cremated and the ashesscattered Sunday at Redondo Beach.   Swartz, a 1930s surfing champ who was a familiar figure onCalifornia beaches with his trademark straw hat, was headed for aWestern Surfing Association contest in Santa Cruz when he died.   ``This 12-year-old kid walked up to me Saturday and said, `Dave,I talked to Hoppy last Friday. Where's Hoppy?''' recalled McIntyre.``I just said `Turn around and look out there.'   ``The waves had been pretty flat and they suddenly came up to 6feet. I said `He's out there.''   ``Surfing was his whole life,'' said Leroy Granis, pioneersurfing photographer who grew up with Swartz when surf boards were110 pounds of pine and redwood.   Swartz started the United States Surfing Association in theearly 1960s.   ``There is now an immense hole in amateur surfing on the WestCoast because he was really the crankshaft of organized surfing onthe West Coast,'' said Surfer magazine publisher Steve Pezman.``The sport will miss him.   ``Surfing is really the antithesis of organized social behaviorso it was hard to organize. But it had to organize to survive.Hoppy was always the guy willing to do the dirty work.   ``He dedicated his life to making surf competitions a placewhere young people could become exposed to sportsmanship and allthe virtues of wave riding.''   In addition to surfing, Swartz had a master's degree inelectrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley,and worked on space radar systems at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, TRW and Hughes Research before retiring at age 55.   Swartz, who recently moved to Long Beach, is survived by abrother, two sisters, two daughters, a son and eight grandchildren.</TEXT></DOC>
