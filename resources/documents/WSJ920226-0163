A logger?</LP><TEXT>   Say that, and you might get chopped off at the knees.Certified Logging Professional, CLP for short, is now thepreferred term.   The pristine woods of Maine have been struck by rampantcredentialism.   A program started last year by Maine forest-productsgroups and logging interests transplants woodsmen into aclassroom for four days of intensive lectures on such issuesas the environment, workplace safety, productivity andhandling a balance sheet. Graduates can put CLP on theirbusiness cards, or carve it on a stump.   &quot;For some, it's a bit of stretch,&quot; says Scott Hanington, alogger from Kingman who won his CLP last year. &quot;One guy wasasked the difference between fixed and variable costs. Hesaid, `A fixed cost? If it's broke, I fix it and it costsme.'&quot;   About 150 loggers hit the books last spring (mud season,when cutting slows), and more than twice as many are due tobe schooled in the next few months. Before certificates arehanded out, inspectors make surprise visits to the woods,surveying graduates' work and checking that cutting is donesafely.   Logging, in fact, is among the most dangerous ofendeavors, with worker's compensation rates in Maine runningabout $37 for every $100 in salary (that compares with about$12 for carpenters). Loggers can cut that rate 10% bybecoming CLPs.   &quot;I'd like to go back 20 years if I could, when thingsweren't so complicated,&quot; says Chris Krukowski, a 36-year-oldlogger who hasn't taken the course but notes it's nowrequired by the companies he cuts for. &quot;You can't do anythingwithout a credential these days, even cut trees.&quot;   Then again, most loggers are no longer &quot;what folksperceive as heathen types, who ride around drinking beer andshooting rats at the dump,&quot; says Mike St. Peter, alogger-safety advocate. &quot;Most don't live in logging campsanymore. They're family men who commute to the woods.&quot;   But professionalism has its costs. The program, which cost$425 per CLP last year, will run $500 this year. &quot;Thoseupfront costs will get paid back eventually, as any doctor orlawyer can tell you,&quot; says Mr. Hanington. &quot;Look, highereducation will cost you.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
