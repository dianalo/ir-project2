Architecture, engineering, law and small-parts assembly areamong the possible jobs quadriplegics could do with the $50,000``Command 1'' work station, said Walter Weisel, chief executiveofficer of Prab Command, Inc. of Kalamzaoo, Mich.   ``Here's a system that costs less than a Mercedes, we candeliver it in weeks and it puts you back on the payroll,'' Weiselsaid.   The system lets a quadriplegic make telephone calls and tapcomputers and data bases around the world, record telephonemessages, operate the desktop computer for accounting and otherpurposes, and perform a variety of other tasks for home andworkplace, the company says.   It was introduced Thursday with a demonstration by Rick Walsh ofSeattle, a 50-year-old quadriplegic who was paralyzed 11 years agoand calls himself a computer illiterate.   Speaking into a headset, Walsh said, ``Keyboard. Robot. GetLotus. Keyboard.''   At his side, a tan mechanical arm like those that hold up thelamp in a dentist's office whirred quietly and fetched a book froma shelf, presenting it to him.   ``Stick Lotus. Keyboard,'' Walsh said. The arm put the bookback. Walsh said he had about three hours of training before thedemonstration.   Similar systems have been developed in university laboratories,said K.G. Engelhardt, director of the health and human servicesrobotics laboratory at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.But she said she knew of no other such system now on the market.   Turning the research into a product is ``a very, very importantstep and a difficult one,'' she said in a telephone interview.``I'm really very pleased that it's happening.''   To use the system, a quadriplegic must be able to see wellenough to read and to pronounce words or make consistent utterancesin place of ordinary words, Weisel said.   He estimated that perhaps half the nation's quadriplegics _people paralyzed in all four limbs _ could use it.   Some 140,000 Americans are quadriplegics because of spinal cordinjury, said Thomas Stripling, associate director for healthstudies and analysis at the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Thetotal may be about 600,000 if one adds people with quadriplegiafrom other conditions such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosisand severe arthritis, he said in a telephone interview.   The heart of the new system is the computer, which learns thesound of each word or utterance and associates it with a command,Weisel said.   Once it learns the sound of one person's words, it will notrespond to the same words spoken by another person, whichintroduces a measure of security, Weisel said.   The full system requires 148 words to operate, said Greg Bodnarof Prab.   One large corporation is thinking about buying 200 or 300systems to use in telephone marketing, Weisel said.   By the end of the year, the company hopes to sell 40 systemsaround the country, chiefly to rehabilitation and educationalcenters, so that training can begin, Weisel said. A person can bewell trained in three or four days, he said.   More general sales will begin next year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
