Bob Dole conceded Friday it was a ``foregone conclusion''that George Bush would win the Republican presidential nomination,while long-shots Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon looked to MichiganDemocrats to resuscitate their fading campaigns.   ``I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening,''Dole told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience in Washington. Doleindicated he was re-evaluating his campaign and would likely ``havesomething to say'' before the April 5 Wisconsin primary.   The campaigns of Gephardt and Dole, winners of the lead-off Iowacaucuses in their respective parties, stood at turning points onFriday.   Gephardt stayed in Michigan, insisting that ``we're going toturn this race around'' _ although his aides were saying privatelythat the Missouri congressman would call it quits if he lostMichigan's Saturday caucuses.   An aura of political fatalism hovered over Dole's hard-luckdrive for the White House, as he said of the successor to PresidentReagan, ``If it can't be me, it will be George Bush.''   Bush has garnered 788 delegates to the Republican NationalConvention in New Orleans next August, more than two-thirds thenumber necessary to win the nomination. Propelled by his sweep inthe Super Tuesday competition of March 8, the vice president hasamassed 727 of those delegates in the last 30 days, while Dole haswon none. The Kansas senator has 178 delegates, and Robertson, 17.   The vice president, who learned about Dole's comments shortlyafter giving a speech at the University of Denver, said, ``Thisdoesn't say it's over. So I'm going to just keep going right downto the wire and not speculate on somebody else's campaign or on theDemocratic side.''   Asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate, Bushsaid, ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any runningmates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that Idon't want to do.''   Dole, in his speech to the Chamber of Commerce, said, ``I'vebeen saying now for some time as a candidate all the things Ithought we should focus on, and nobody really seems to care.''   ``I think it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happeningon the Republican side,'' he said. ``But I still have some thingsto say. Lo and behold, as your candidacy weakens, you find morepeople willing to listen.''   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, shrugged off questions about hisrole in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``The Democrats are short of real issues,'' he said, ``bringingit up over and over again. No one is even suggesting I have doneanything wrong.''   Most of the Democrats were in Michigan, scouring the heavilyindustrialized state for votes in Saturday's caucuses, with 138delegates at stake.   Michigan had been described by Gephardt's aides earlier as ado-or-die campaign battlefield. On Friday, Gephardt mimicked rivalMichael Dukakis' claim of an economic miracle in Massachusetts,saying he looked forward to a ``Michigan miracle'' to revive hiscandidacy.   ``We're going to get back in the middle of this thing,''Gephardt said in an interview on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program.   Dukakis was leading in opinion polls in Michigan, but he warnedhis supporters not to take anything for granted. ``Friends, you'relooking at a guy who was 50 points ahead in the polls in 1978 whenI first ran for re-election ... and I lost,'' he said.   The Massachusetts governor, a longtime opponent of U.S. aid tothe Nicaraguan Contras, said he would support aid to the rebels tosupport the new ceasefire and the regional peace plan of CostaRican President Oscar Arias _ ``providing it is channeled throughinternational relief agencies, neutral agencies and not the CIA andthe agencies of the federal government.''   During an airport news conference, Simon was asked about thepossibility that he would win no delegates in Michigan.   ``I recognize that's a possibility but it's not fatal to mycampaign,'' he said.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. sought to set himself apart from the restof the Democratic field, saying his more moderate stands are ``notconservative. I've never used that word. Let me hasten to add, youdon't have to be very far to the right to be to the right of thiscrowd.''   Jesse Jackson criticized Reagan for vetoing legislationextending a civil rights law _ a veto supported by Bush butoverridden by Congress _ and called it ``an attempt to turn backthe clock.''   ``Any man who stands ... against civil rights restoration inthis country is not fit to lead our nation,'' Jackson said inDetroit.   Dukakis and Jackson are running one-two in the Democraticdelegate race, according to The Associated Press tabulation.   Dukakis has 548 of the 2,082 delegates needed for nomination,while Jackson has 520. Gore has 362 delegates, Simon 171 andGephardt 154.</TEXT></DOC>
