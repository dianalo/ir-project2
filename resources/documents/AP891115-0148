But the Soviet-backed government denied guerrilla claims ofcapturing a strategic army stronghold in the mountains west ofKabul, whose only road to the Soviet Union remained closed for aseventh day. The cutoff drove up prices of flour and gasoline.   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said bands of theU.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas from a number of groups united tolaunch the attack on Jalalabad, the site of a failed rebel attackin March. The government's Bakhtar News Agency reported thatguerrillas were also shelling the road from Jalalabad to Kabul inan attempt to close it.   Amani said the guerrillas were trying to take a militarygarrison at Dolunta, about 12 miles west of the city. But he saidgovernment troops pushed them back.   On Monday, the government claimed 10,000 guerrillas werepreparing to attack the city. They failed to take Jalalabad earlierthis year because they could not unite and lacked experience inlaunching conventional operations. Also government bombers provedsuccessful at knocking out guerrilla positions, diplomats have said.   Amani said the Afghan air force bombed rebel artillery inSamarkhail and other villages near Jalalabad. He said guerrillasforces were preparing an attack on Khost, a strategic city south ofJalalabad in Paktiya province.   Both cities are close to the Pakistan border, where theguerrillas have bases.   The government denied a claim that guerrilla forces had captureda government garrison in Pajak, 18 miles west of Kabul in themountains. Guerrilla-run radio in Pakistan claimed its forces tookthe stronghold late last week. Western diplomats in Pakistan saidthe guerrillas were steadily chipping away at Kabul's securityperimeter and the latest battle linked forces west and north of thecapital.   Amani said the stronghold had not fallen and that militaryactivity in the area was quiet. Soldiers with knowledge of thesituation in Pajak said fighting was fierce but that guerrillaforces had not succeeded in taking the garrison. Earlier this weekthe government fired several Soviet-made Scud rockets to the westalong with dozens of smaller rockets.   Soldiers with knowledge of the Salang highway, the main road tothe Soviet border, said guerrilla forces near the Salang tunnel,about 60 miles from Kabul, had closed the highway for the lastweek. They said more than 3,000 trucks were waiting to come southto Kabul, carrying food, gasoline and weapons.   Witnesses from Salang said guerrillas in the area claimed thegovernment was trying to move 800 tanks down the highway inaddition to food and fuel. Soldiers confirmed that tanks were beingtransported to military bases near the capital but said they didnot know how many.   In Kabul, prices of flour went back up to $4 for a 15-poundsack, after falling to $3.50 last week when the road was open.   The government acknowledged the highway had been closed but saidit was caused by damage due to mines. Rebel forces closed thehighway for 10 days last month, causing prices of flour andgasoline to jump 50 percent.   The Soviet Union completed pulling out its troops in February,more than nine years after sending in forces to support a Marxistregime.</TEXT></DOC>
