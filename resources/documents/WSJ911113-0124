Fleet's desire to buy the troubled assets, which was firstreported in American Banker, a trade publication, mayindicate that the bank's outlook for the New England economyhas brightened, according to analysts.</LP><TEXT>   When Fleet bought Bank of New England in July, it assumed$14.5 billion of sound assets that remained in the failedbank and left $5.5 billion of troubled assets with the FDIC.Fleet's loan work-out subsidiary, Recoll Management Corp.,then began managing those bad assets for lucrative fees --estimated to be $110 million over five years -- paid by theFDIC.   In the ensuing months, however, Recoll has discovered thatjust under 10% of the loans in the portfolio are &quot;loans forwhich payments are still current&quot; even though the loans areconsidered troubled, said Robert Lougee, a Fleet spokesman.&quot;Those are the loans we want to buy.&quot;   Though negotiations with the FDIC have just begun, Mr.Lougee said Fleet expected that the price for the portfoliowould be determined by current market rates fortroubled-asset purchases. Among Fleet's conditions in thenegotiations, Mr. Lougee added, is that any loans that sour-- among approximately 1,500 loans the bank is hoping to buy-- can be given back to the FDIC.   Mr. Lougee said that the bank's initial, July projectionthat it would return $2.5 billion of the bank's $14.5 billionin assets to the FDIC has also been revised. He said Fleetnow expects to return only about $1.5 billion in bad assetsto the FDIC. The purchase of Bank of New England made Fleet,with $45 billion in assets, the region's largest bank.   &quot;All this indicates that the freefall that Fleet and otherbanks in the region have seen over the last 18 months intheir loan portfolios has started to stabilize,&quot; said GerardCassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. &quot;Fleet's movesare clearly based on an improved outlook for the region.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
