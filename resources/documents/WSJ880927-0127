Called &quot;Inside Edition,&quot; the show will be the first in-house production made by King, the leading distributor of syndicated television shows with &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot; &quot;Inside Edition&quot; is also the first of what analysts predict will be several attempts to compete with or replace &quot;USA Today: The Television Show.&quot;    Produced by GTG Entertainment, the company formed by former NBC President Grant Tinker and Gannett, the TV version of USA Today premiered only two weeks ago as one of the most-hyped shows of the year. But it was quickly savaged by critics and viewers alike: the first week's ratings were poor in many major cities, and already some station managers are considering whether to replace the new show.    As a result, &quot;USA Today&quot; already is undergoing changes imposed by its executive producer, former &quot;Today&quot; show producer Steve M. Friedman, to slow the pace and to air fewer stories.    King World's chief operating officer, Stephen W. Palley, said the new show is meant to fill a void left by the &quot;lack of success of first-run syndicated shows introduced this year -- and that {USA Today} is certainly one of the shows on our minds.&quot;    Dennis McAlpine, a television industry analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., says the so-called prime-time access period King World is aiming for is likely to become the target of other producers as well. &quot;Everybody's looking at it,&quot; he says. &quot;They have to. It's a very lucrative time period.&quot;    Richard Kurlander, vice president and programming director at Petry Television, a TV consulting company, said the fate of USA Today will likely be decided much sooner than GTG expects. &quot;The story will really play itself out in the next two weeks, when the Olympics are gone.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
