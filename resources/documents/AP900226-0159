Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said ``Individuals might proposedramatically different solutions to the Tongass issue,'' but ``theyalmost all agree that what is needed most in southeast Alaska iscertainty.''   The size of West Virginia and Delaware combined, the forest istreasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear andbald eagles, and the largest spawning ground for salmon. It is thelast remaining temperate-zone rain forest in North America.   To local residents, it is the keystone of their economy throughthe timber it yields.   The jobs-environment conflict has made the forest one of themost vigorously fought environmental issues in Congress since 1980,when Alaska lands legislation established the current forestmanagement regime.   During a hearing on legislation the House passed last summer,Johnston said he would have a Senate bill ready for a committeevote next week and fast floor action ``in hopes of getting toconference with the House and resolving these issues once and forall.''   The House measure would cancel 50-year contracts with two timbercompanies who supportrs of the bill say stifled other competitionwhile getting trees at bargain rates.   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who led the House debate for thebill called the contracts ``a raid on the taxpayers.'' Critics haveclaimed that the government in recent years has wound up getting $2in revenue for $100 in timber production costs.   Miller and other supporters said the legislation would open theforest to other companies and make more money for the government.It also strengthens restrictions on timbering in order to protectthe wildlife habitat.   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he and the rest of theAlaska delegation, Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, all opposethe House bill, which he says would cripple the economy ofsoutheastern Alaska.   Murkowski said the government is not losing money on Tongasstimber sales and expanded wilderness areas in the forest are notneeded.   ``The purpose of our fight now is to maintain the viablity ofAlaska communities whose lifeblood is the resources produced onpublic lands,'' said Murkowski, who has introduced a bill thatpreserves the 50-year contracts with Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikanand Alaska Pulp Co., a Japanese firm.   Murkowski said the committee should postpone action on Tongassuntil June when the Forest Service will release a revised plan forthe forest.   Patricia Kearney, acting assistant secretary of agriculture forforests, said the service spent $7 million and two years working onthe plan and urged that it be considered before Congress takesfinal action on how to manage the forest.</TEXT></DOC>
