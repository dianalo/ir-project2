Henke III chairman and chief executive officer and said it intends to acquire the banks that Mr. Henke controls.    Mr. Henke will succeed John E. Kirkpatrick and Walter H. Helmerich III, the company's co-chairmen, who will become honorary co-chairmen.    The president and chief-executive positions of Oklahoma's second-largest banking company have been vacant since last fall, when K. Gordon Greer left the posts. Mr. Greer remains chairman and chief executive of First National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Tulsa, one of the company's two banks. Raymond H. Hefner, an Oklahoma oil man, has been handling the chief executive's duties as chairman of Bank of MidAmerica's executive committee.    A spokesman said the president's job is still vacant.    Like many Southwestern banks, the bank holding company has been hammered by the energy, real estate and agriculture slumps, posting a net loss of $39.6 million in 1987. Banks of Mid-America, which had $2.26 billion in assets at March 31, recently proposed a recapitalization plan calling for it to raise $60 million to $75 million through a rights offering, to pay off about $50 million in long-term debt at a discount and to convert preferred stock into common.    The company earlier this month rejected a similar restructuring plan that would have turned control over to Pittsburgh-based consultants, saying it wanted to maintain Oklahoma ownership and management.    The company said Mr. Henke's employment agreement calls for him to raise the new equity first and then to reach definitive agreements within 10 months to acquire Utica Bankshares Corp. and American Bank andamp; Trust Co., both of Tulsa. Mr. Henke previously was chairman and president of the Utica bank and chairman of American Bank. He owns a controlling interest in both banks.    Mr. Henke also will receive an option to acquire 5% of Banks of Mid-America. In an interview, he said his two banks, as well as Banks of Mid-America's two banks, all have capital levels in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, and that neither the recapitalization nor the merger would require Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. assistance. Only American Bank andamp; Trust, with assets of $161 million at Dec. 31, had a profit last year, however.    The Utica bank, with $256 million in assets at Dec. 31, had an $804,000 loss in 1987. Mr. Henke recapitalized that bank in 1983 with $18 million in new capital. He said that adding his two former banks to Banks of Mid-America would give the company strategic locations in Tulsa that are comparable with the company's Liberty National Bank presence in Oklahoma City. </TEXT></DOC>
