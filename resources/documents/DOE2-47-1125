<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1125 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experiment has been performed to investigate the chemical reactionbetween the liquid phases of the eutectic lithium-lead (Li{sub 17}Pb{sub83}) and water. The reactants and products were constrained within aclosed reaction vessel, allowing the extent of reaction to be determinedfrom the partial pressure of the hydrogen reaction product. The datafrom the tests showed that the extent of reaction did not depend uponthe water temperature. The data also indicated that the extent of reactionpassed through a maximum as the initial liquid metal temperature wasvaried from 350 to 500 C, and a model was developed to explain this behavior.11 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
