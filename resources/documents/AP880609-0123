(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Assemblies of God ministers stillassociated with defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart as of Oct. 1will lose their own credentials, the nation's largest Pentecostaldenomination announced today.   Ministers working for Swaggart's church, television operationsor Bible school ``are being required to resign ... on or beforeOct. 1 in order to maintain their credentials with the church,''said Assemblies spokeswoman Juleen Turnage.   The 13 members of the Executive Presbytery headed by GeneralSuperintendent G. Raymond Carlson made the decision Wednesdayduring a regular meeting here, Mrs. Turnage said.   She said she did not know how many Assemblies ministers werestill working for Swaggart but estimated the number at 80 or 90.``Even when we had a relationship with Jimmy Swaggart we didn'thave a list of his employees,'' she said.   On April 8 the Executive Presbytery dismissed Swaggart forrefusing to accept a year's banishment from the pulpit for anunspecified sin. A prostitute has claimed the fire-and-brimstonepreacher paid her to pose nude in a motel room.   The Baton Rouge, La., evangelist has since returned to hispulpit.   Jim Rentz, pastor of Swaggart's Family Worship Center, resignedboth his ordination and his position on the Assemblies' Louisianapresbytery to align himself with Swaggart, according to Assembliesministers.   Ray Trask stepped down as president of Jimmy Swaggart BibleCollege rather than lose his Assemblies affiliation.</TEXT></DOC>
