The dominant Americnview is that to encounter the Soviets in multilateral contexts is toengage in laborious talkathons that are bound to produce nothing: a guaranteedexposure to the bad (the Soviets); the dull (the negotiating process);and the empty (the results). The author gives evidence, observations,and speculations on how this scene is viewed from the Soviet perspectiveand what value the Soviet leadership places in the multilateral armscontrol approach. He also looks at what policies they might pursue inthe future.</TEXT></DOC>
