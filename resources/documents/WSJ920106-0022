But why?   It is a foreign telephone company, much in vogue nowadays.And it is up 30% from the mid-November initial offeringprice, at 24 3/4 Friday. Yet this Virgin Islands company isamong the more expensive international telephone issues --and that's not the only daunting thing about the stock, someskeptics say.</LP><TEXT>   Looking beyond the grandiose name, Atlantic Tele-Networkis a holding company for Virgin Islands Telephone Corp.(popularly known as Vitelco) and has an 80% stake in GuyanaTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   In the $19-a-share IPO on Nov. 14, the stock wasoversubscribed by investors who remembered the sizzling gainsin Mexican, Spanish and Chilean telephone stocks. Thecompany's shares quickly rose as high as 23 3/4, despite a120-point drop in the Dow Jones industrials the day after theoffering. Gabelli andamp; Co. telecommunications analyst Sal Muoio,hired as a consultant by the company's underwriters,envisions a 95% leap in its operating earnings next year asthe company modernizes Guyana's dilapidated phone system.   So far, so good. But Atlantic Tele-Network has a troubledhistory in the Virgin Islands that still haunts it. In 1989,Hurricane Hugo wiped out more than three-quarters of itsVirgin Islands phone lines. The company has since replacedthem, but, in one of its many battles with regulators, waschallenged about the access charges it billed tolong-distance carriers after the lines were repaired.   News sometimes travels slowly to the Caribbean. In earlyNovember, the Federal Communications Commission ruled in oneof its regular sessions that Atlantic Tele-Network mustrefund about $1.1 million, including estimated interest,related to the post-Hugo access charges. The company,however, didn't receive word of the opinion until a writtenorder was released the week before Christmas, companyspokesman Ed Crouch says. On Dec. 23, as the Dow Jonesindustrials soared, the company's shares tumbled 1 1/2 to 203/4 after it told shareholders it might have losses of sixcents a share in the fourth quarter if it doesn't win anappeal of the ruling. The stock has since rebounded sharply.   Atlantic Tele-Network's offering document includes fourpages of rocky regulatory history. The Virgin Islands PublicService Commission tried to halt its $97 million leveragedbuy-out in 1987, when two LBO specialists bought Vitelco fromITT Corp. In the deal, Cornelius B. Prior Jr., a formertelecommunications investment banker for Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co., and accountant Jeffrey J. Prosser each put up just $475in equity and a $500,000 loan, which later was repaid via anITT loan. (Kidder was lead underwriter for the company'srecent IPO.)   Island regulators closely scrutinized the company's loanagreements with the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative,Rural Electrification Administration and others, and clampeddown on inter-company loans. They also worried about thecompany's heavy debt: The offering reduced debt to 70% from90% of total capital. Under a recent accord, Messrs. Priorand Prosser agreed to step down as top executives of Vitelcoby next July and the company agreed to limit dividends whileparing debt. Vitelco also is fighting for $32 million inunpaid insurance claims.   With all that bad publicity from the Virgin Islands,Atlantic Tele-Network initially got a mixed reception inGuyana this year when it paid the government $16.5 millionfor an 80% stake in the country's run-down telephone company,according to David Caires, editor of Guyana's largestindependent newspaper, the Stabroek News in Georgetown. Aftertwo decades of socialism, Guyana -- which has averageper-capita income of $409 a year -- is slowly piloting atransition to a market economy.   Guyana's 11-month-old regulatory commission aired some ofAtlantic Tele-Network's earlier laundry and &quot;aggressively&quot;scrutinized it, Mr. Crouch, the company spokesman, says. Itcriticized management and assumed authority over intercompanyloans and advances. Mr. Caires notes that some localresidents have complained about the speed of repairs.   &quot;The jury is still out,&quot; Mr. Caires says. &quot;The telephonesystem here is in a terrible state. People are waiting to seeif they'll turn it around.&quot;   Nevertheless, last month, Guyanese regulators gaveAtlantic Tele-Network a 160% rate increase on calls to theU.S. and Britain to compensate for devaluation of theGuyanese currency. That move heartened supporters such as Mr.Muoio, the company's consultant, who expects the company'sprofit to soar as it modernizes equipment in Guyana, morethan doubles its capacity there and reaps the benefit ofhard-currency revenue from calls going into Guyana. Heexpects operating earnings to leap to $1.95 a share in 1992and $2.50 a share in 1993 from about $1 expected this year.   The company declines to comment on Mr. Muoio's estimates,but spokesman Mr. Crouch calls him &quot;very bullish.&quot; Yet Mr.Prosser, chairman and co-chief executive, says he expectsthat in 1992 revenue from the Guyanese telephone system willequal the revenue from the Virgin Islands -- indicating thatthe Guyanese revenue will more than double.   Still, at 24 3/4, Atlantic Tele-Network is trading atalmost 13 times estimated 1992 earnings, making it moreexpensive than Telmex, Mexico's more-stable telephonecompany, which trades at about nine times expected earnings.By several other measures -- price to cash flow, price torevenue and price-to-book value (assets minus liabilities) --the company's shares also are pricier than those of Telmex,Spain's Telefonica de Espana, New Zealand's Telecom Corp. andregional telephone companies in the U.S., according toGoldman Sachs analyst Robert Morris.   Yet none of those companies' regions are filled with thepolitical uncertainty facing Guyana. Later this year, thecountry is expected to hold its first free elections innearly 30 years. Both Caribbean and American politicalanalysts say they expect the newly elected government toremain friendly to private investment. But as one large U.S.shareholder puts it, &quot;there's no question there's significantpolitical risk&quot; in the stock.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks roared to their sixth consecutiverecord high in a broad-based rally.

Some of the largest OTC issues lagged smaller shares asApple Computer dropped 1/2 to 59, Intel slipped 1/4 to 50,Sun Microsystems eased 3/4 to 28 1/8 and Microsoft sagged 1to 113.   SciMed Life Systems rocketed 8 1/4 to 90 1/2 after thecompany disclosed plans to unveil three new products over thenext several weeks. The gain brings the stock to withinstriking distance of its 52-week high of 93, which it hitbefore fears over patent litigation against the company sentthe issue tumbling in September. The most onerous of thesuits was settled in November.   Centigram Communications plunged 3 1/2 to 6 3/4. Thecompany said it expects to report about break-even resultsfor the first quarter ended last month, compared withyear-ago earnings of 16 cents a share. The company said somelarge customer orders have been delayed because of thesluggish economy. Sales, however, will rise to a range of$9.5 million to $10 million, up from $8 million a yearearlier.   Shares of computer disk drive manufacturers gained onactive volume after Hambrecht andamp; Quist analyst Todd Bakar madepositive comments about the group. The analyst sees a reboundin the offing for the industry, which was hurt last year bysluggish demand and price competition.
