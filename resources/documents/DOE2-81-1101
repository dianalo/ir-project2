Autoacceleration of polymerizationis related with sharply increased viscosity of the system as a resultof accumulation of the soluble polymer. Introducing of chlorinated paraffininto the radiation-cured compositions results in cessation of autoaccelerationand cross-linking and to finish the curing process the higher irradiationdoses are necessary. MM of the introduced polymer does not affect essentiallythe value of the propagation constant, but decreases the terminationconstant.</TEXT></DOC>
