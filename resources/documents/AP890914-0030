After all, Pierce's account fit with the public image of the onlyCabinet member to serve the entire Reagan presidency. At HUD,``Silent Sam'' was known as a man who arrived late and left early,traveled often, knew little about HUD programs and sometimes had theoffice television tuned to soap operas.   Then Shirley Wiseman, a former top HUD official, opened thefloodgates.   Pierce, she said in later testimony, personally ordered her toapprove funding for a North Carolina project that had been opposedby several HUD officials.   The project, it turned out, was backed by a former Pierce lawpartner. Suddenly, Pierce's image changed to that of a man who hadbeen more involved in HUD decisions than he let on.   Wiseman's testimony brought intense congressional and mediascrutiny of Pierce's role at HUD, and led to report after report ofhis intervention on behalf of prominent Republicans _ James Watt,Carla Hills, and former Sen. Edward Brooke among them. Jazz musicianLionel Hampton and a prominent black GOP couple also got help fromthe secretary, as did attorneys at his former law firm, HUD recordsshow.   Pierce returns as a witness on Friday before the Housesubcommittee that originally questioned him, to tell his own storyand field questions about the apparent contradiction between what hesaid and what Wiseman and others have said since.   ``I believe that the vast majority of HUD's employees served mewell,'' Pierce told Time magazine in an interview published thisweek. ``But there were rotten apples in and out of the HUD barrel.''   Unlike the first appearance, this time Pierce will be accompaniedby an attorney.   ``I'm not going to prejudge him,'' said subcommittee memberBarney Frank, D-Mass., who had a heated exchange with Pierce duringhis May testimony.   ``He's entitled to his say and he's shown that he's willing totestify,'' Frank said Wednesday. ``Obviously there are somecontradictions that need to be explained.''   In two recent interviews, Pierce has contended that his earliertestimony was misunderstood, and that by saying he was not a ``handson'' manager he did not mean he never took a personal interest inHUD projects or proposals. But he insists that politics played norole in his decisions.   ``No request was to be given any special advantage because it wassubmitted by a Republican or was in some way associated with aRepublican,'' he told Time. ``My decisions were based on fact, lawand logic, not on political party.''   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has laid blame for the agency's problemson Pierce, saying it is obvious that the secretary did not keep tabson the department. The Bush administration has tried to distanceitself from the agency's problems with promises to flush politicsout of its decisions.   Several friends and associates say Pierce faces an unfair end toa public career that includes appointments to judgeships in hisnative New York and jobs in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations.   His associates say the 67-year-old Pierce left himself open tohis current problems because of his habit of delegating authority toothers.   ``If he's not interested in something, he didn't want to bebothered,'' said Roy Englert, a Washington attorney who served underPierce at the Treasury Department in the 1970s.   Pierce has said his former top aide, Deborah Gore Dean, andothers violated his trust. Congressional testimony and HUD recordsshow that Dean was often contacted by developers seeking money andwielded considerable influence over which projects received approval.   Ms. Dean, through her attorneys, counters that whatever actionsshe took were done at Pierce's request.</TEXT></DOC>
