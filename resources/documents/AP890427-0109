Addressing Parliament, Kohl repeated his call for negotiationsto reduce the number of short-range nuclear rockets in Europe aswell as atomic artillery.   ``Because of the range of the short-range systems, the FederalRepublic of Germany is affected more by these weapons than theother partners in the alliance,'' Kohl said.   ``It is to me self-evident for our friends to have the sameunderstanding for our interests as we have shown many times fortheirs,'' he added.   Britain and the United States have been critical of Kohl'sproposal for superpower talks on tactical atomic arms deployed inEurope. But NATO allies Belgium, Norway and Denmark have indicatedtheir support for Kohl on the issue.   Many lawmakers applauded when Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher indirectly criticized the United States and Britain fortheir stand.   ``There is much to fear in this world. But we certainly don'thave to fear negotiations, and we don't have to fear talks with aSoviet Union that is ready for negotiations,'' he told Parliament.   Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the West Germanpopulation favors eliminating all nuclear weapons in Europe. Mostof NATO's short-range weapons are based in West Germany.   Kohl reassured the United States and other NATO partners thathis government does not want to eliminate those battlefield nuclearweapons.   ``In the current circumstances, land, sea and airborneshort-range nuclear weapons are still important in Europe,'' hesaid.   The chancellor also said the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationcannot afford to make unilateral disarmament moves ``as long as theWarsaw Pact has a superior military potential andsecurity-political risks continue to exist.''   Kohl has called on NATO to delay a decision on replacing theaging short-range Lance nuclear missiles that are on West Germansoil until after national elections scheduled for late next year.   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social DemocraticParty, called Kohl's proposal for talks on short-range atomicarsenals ``half-hearted'' and repeated his demand that all thoseweapons be eliminated from West Germany.   Kohl's call for negotiations on short-range nuclear weaponsappears to be part of a wide-ranging attempt to win public support.   In recent weeks he has taken a number of actions to try tobolster his sagging popularity and to defuse criticism that hasthreatened his conservative coalition government.   Kohl has reshuffled his Cabinet and has reversed himself onseveral widely unpopular issues, abandoning for example a plan toextend compulsary military service terms from 15 to 18 months.   While trying to improve his image among West Germans eager forarms control and domestic reform, Kohl has incurred the wrath ofthe United States and Britain for his proposal on short-rangenuclear weapons.   The United States has launched a diplomatic offensive againstKohl's proposal, instructing its ambassadors in NATO countries topresent arguments against starting up negotiations on short-rangeweapons.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain also has criticizedKohl's move and is expected to discuss the matter with him duringtalks in West Germany on Sunday.   Britain and the United States fear that starting up negotiationson the tactical arsenals could lead to their elimination andincrease the threat from superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.   But Kohl, Genscher and other West German leaders say the climateis ripe for stepping up disarmament efforts with the Soviets.</TEXT></DOC>
