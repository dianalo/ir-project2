KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the House Foreign AffairsCommittee says Venezuela's investigation of a foreign-exchangescandal is causing some U.S. corporations to re-examine theirinvestments in the country and to withdraw top executives.   Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., in a letter to Venezuela'sambassador in Washington, said: ``At a time when economic growth isa priority, it would be a shame to see foreign corporationsdiscouraged from investing in Venezuela or decide to curtail theiroperations.''   ``I do not wish to interfere in any way in domestic affairs or inthe judicial system in Venezuela; nor can I comment on the merits ofthe case,'' Fascell said in his June 13 letter to Ambassador SimonConsalvi.   ``As a friend of Venezuela, however, I do wish to bring to yourattention the problems this case is causing for foreign business,''he said. ``Some American corporations have removed their topexecutives and are re-examining their investments in your country.''   Fascell said that he has been told by executives of majorAmerican corporations that a Venezuelan judge has issued arrestwarrants for several people, including American executives, ``oncharges of fraud in obtaining preferential foreign exchange.''   ``I understand the charges involved do not permit those accusedto be granted bail,'' Fascell said. ``The executives involved claimthey and their corporations are innocent.''   Replying, Ambassador Consalvi said his government ``does notwelcome any discouragement to the presence of foreign businesses andinvestment,'' and in fact welcomes them.   But he said the government, operating under a system ofseparation of powers, respects ``the independence of the judicialsystem.''   He also noted that Venezuela acted in March to abolish themultiple exchange rate system.   Investigators in Venezuela have been examining allegations thatbillions of dollars in illegal profits were skimmed from a nowdisbanded office set up to distribute U.S. dollars at favorableexchange rates for essential imports.   The investigators have been quoted in published reports as sayingthat some $2.4 billion of the $30 billion involved may have beentouched by fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
