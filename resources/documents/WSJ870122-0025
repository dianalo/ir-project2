The reserves of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. fund, which insures deposits totaling $890 billion in 3,000 savings and loans, have dropped to only $1.9 billion, Mr. Gray told a Senate Banking Committee hearing. The ratio of the fund's reserves to deposits insured is the lowest ever, Mr. Gray said.    The FSLIC currently secures $2 billion in loans made by the 12 regional Federal Home Loan banks to ailing thrifts that are unable to put up any collateral of their own. &quot;A call on these advances by the Federal Home Loan banks would wipe out the primary reserve&quot; of the insurance fund, Mr. Gray said.    Requests for an additional $2 billion in FSLIC-guaranteed loans are pending at the regional banks, he said.    Mr. Gray said the 347 most troubled thrifts are having losses of about $2.2 billion a year, $350 million more than the FSLIC collects in annual insurance premiums.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits of $1.5 trillion held in 14,800 banks, has reserves of $18 billion.    The Senate panel heard testimony yesterday on a number of banking issues, including a Treasury Department plan to generate as much as $25 billion for the dwindling FSLIC over five years. Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) said he hopes the panel will approve a banking bill by the end of February.    As Reagan administration officials urged the Senate panel to approve the Treasury Department's plan to recapitalize the FSLIC, a representative of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions explained the trade group's own FSLIC proposal to the House Banking Committee. The organization's plan, which would be less costly to the industry, would generate about $10 billion for the fund over two years.    Mr. Gray and Treasury Undersecretary George Gould both told the Senate committee that the trade group's plan was too small to cope with the troubles facing the thrift industry. &quot;Their plan, like a bad check, ought to be rejected by Congress for insufficient funds,&quot; Mr. Gould said.    Although the Treasury plan was passed by both the House and Senate at the end of the last congressional session, the two bodies couldn't meet to reconcile the differences in other parts of the bills before Congress adjourned.    In other testimony at the Senate hearing, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, FDIC Chairman William Seidman and Treasury Undersecretary Gould all urged the lawmakers to approve legislation giving banks the right to exercise certain securities powers, including underwriting debt-backed securities and sponsoring mutual funds.    Noting that the Fed currently is considering applications from Bankers Trust New York Corp., Citicorp and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. to carry out some of those activities through subsidiaries, Mr. Volcker told the senators: &quot;If you don't make these decisions, they will be made for you.&quot;    Mr. Volcker also said it doesn't worry him that Japanese banks have replaced U.S. institutions as the world's largest banks, discounting concerns expressed last week by Treasury Secretary James Baker.    The Fed chairman said major U.S. banks are &quot;active international competitors&quot; and attributed the growth of Japanese banks to the strength of the yen, Japan's concentrated banking system and its high savings rate. </TEXT></DOC>
