(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The catch from some of Florida's mostpopular fishing spots is unhealthy and even fish and alligator meatfrom the protected Everglades is off limits as test after test showsalarming levels of mercury.   ``If it's so bad here in the Everglades, which is supposed to beso pristine and so pure, then what's it like outside the park?''said Pat Tolle, spokeswoman for Everglades National Park, where 10times the federally set safe level of poisonous metal was found infish and alligators.   Health officials have warned against eating large amounts of fishfrom Deer Point Lake near Panama City and fishing spots down to theLoxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge south of Lake Okeechobee. Thesecond annual alligator hunt was canceled in much of southernFlorida because the meat was tainted, and high levels of mercuryturned up in the Tampa Bay area and the Suwannee River.   The levels of mercury, usually associated with factories andprocessing plants, shocked state experts when testing began lastyear.   ``An hour before we got the first results, I would have beenwilling to say to someone, `Not in Florida, because we don't havethat type of industry,''' said Thomas Savage, a Department ofEnvironmental Regulation biologist.   ``But what we're finding is that there is a chronic low level ofmercury in fish statewide, and then there are hot spots like theEverglades.''   Wildlife officers are testing the rare Florida panther and planto do the same with wading birds. They hope those animals, unlikebass and alligators, do not eat enough fish to ingest dangerousamounts of mercury _ but they say no one expected to find mercury inthe first place.   ``Birds and mammals need to be looked at,'' said Burkett Neely,manager at Loxahatchee. ``We're doing testing into the estuary andout into Florida Bay _ and there, you're getting into a commercialfishing zone.''   If mercury is found in higher animals, Ms. Tolle said it mighthelp explain one of the park's mysteries, a drop in wading birdssince 1900. ``The numbers now are 90 percent less that at the turnof the century.''   Mercury's effects on people _ damage to the nervous system thatcan cause deafness, numbness, reduced vision and coordination _ arewell documented, but little is known about what it can do to thecomplex ecology, she said.   Most people seem to be heeding the health advisories. Before thefirst warnings, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commissionfound that fishermen relased 56 percent of the largemouth basscaught around Loxahatchee. After the warnings, that climbed to 81percent, said Frank Morello, an agency biologist.   Harder to convince are low-income residents around the parks whosupplement their diets by fishing and are suspicious or ignorant ofthe advisories. But so far, there's no evidence of anyone affectedby mercury poisoning, Savage said.   Of most concern is determining the origin of the contamination.   A prime suspect for the mercury present in lower levels aroundFlorida is airborne pollution, Savage said. ``Just like Canada andthe United States have an acid rain problem, Florida may have aproblem with mercury.''   That would explain why mercury is widespread, but Savage saidsome areas have virtually no mercury in fish, undermining the theory.   When the initial findings were confined to Loxahatchee, primesuspects were farms south of Okeechobee, who once used now-banned,mercury-based fungicides. But it became clear that agriculture alonewasn't enough of an explanation.   Savage and others are looking at a theory that mercury, whichoccurs in small amounts naturally, may concentrate in certainplants, which in turn die and are compressed into peat at the bottomof the Everglades.   ``The peat down there, that very rich Everglades muck, hasnaturally a very high level of mercury,'' Savage said. ``It'spossible man has disrupted the peat with drainage and watermovement, mobilizing the mercury.''   Drainage canals and water movement could help explain why some ofthe highest concentrations are in areas of the Everglades neverexploited directly by man. ``You have to look what's upstream,''Neely said.   Water in southern Florida flows from the agricultural areas alongLake Okeechobee generally southward into the Everglades, he said.``It's possible the mercury is being released naturally from thepeat and is being moved up and down by farming practices.''   Whatever the cause, the discovery has changed for the worse theway people look at their natural surroundings.   ``My worst fear is, what else don't I know?'' Neely said. ``Whatis this going to do to the wildlife? What are the long term effects?And what other bear traps are we going to step in out there?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
