General Assembly.   But a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Arafathad not applied. Last week, Arafat told a Saudi Arabian newspaper heplanned to attend the U.N. session which opens in two weeks.   In a meeting with reporters, Habib Boulares, the Tunisianminister of culture and information, said issuing a visa should notbe a problem. ``We consider he has the right to go to the U.N.,''Boulares said.   The Tunisian said he did not think the Bush administration wouldwant to see the United Nations shift its deliberations to Geneva inorder to hear Arafat.   He referred to the transfer to the Swiss city of a specialsession on the Palestinian issue after the Reagan administrationdenied Arafat a visa for New York last year. Subsequently, theadministration concluded Arafat had renounced terrorism and opened adialogue with the PLO.   It is being held in Tunisia, where the PLO maintains itsheadquarters. The talks have not helped to break a stalemate inaddressing the Arab-Israeli dispute.   But Boulares said the dialogue should go on. ``When people talktogether they can find a good way to solve pending problems,'' hesaid.   On another subject, Boulares urged the Bush administration andthe World Bank to ease Tunisia's $5 billion debt burden bystretching out repayment of loans and lowering interest rates.   He said the North African country had undertaken politicalreforms that included abolition of forced labor and restrictingpre-trial custody.   Boulares said a drought and infestation of locusts contributed toTunisia's difficulties.   He is in the United States in connection with an exhibition ofmosaics to be exhibited on Thursday in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
