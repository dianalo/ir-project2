Prisoners' Rights Case</HEAD><BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether prison officials sometimes must explain why they bar aninmate from having visitors.   The justices said they will study a federal appeals court rulingthat a Kentucky prison's visitation program created a ``libertyinterest'' for inmates that cannot be infringed upon without dueprocess.   The appeals court ruling did not say what kind of due process _perhaps a written explanation of denied visitation rights or sometype of hearing _ is required. But Kentucky officials appealedanyway.   More than half the states supported Kentucky's appeal in a``friend-of-the-court'' brief, urging the high court to issue adecision setting precedent nationally.   They said the Kentucky prison's visitation policy is similar tothose at prisons in many states.   ``More significantly, there are a number of other policies atthe correctional institutions ... concerning the daily operation ofprisons ranging from inmate job assignments to telephone privilegeswhich in all likelihood are also affected,'' the states' briefcontended.   The Kentucky controversy stems from a lawsuit inmates of theKentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange filed over conditions there.   The suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree, in which the stateagreed, among other things, to continue an ``open visitationpolicy.''   State officials subsequently adopted guidelines and proceduresfor handling prison visits.   In 1985, inmate Kenneth Bolitt's mother was denied the right tovisit him temporarily because she had brought to the prison withher a man previously barred for smuggling contraband.   Inmate Kevin Black's mother and girlfriend were barred from theprison temporarily because Black had been convicted of possessingcontraband immediately after one of their visits.   A ``class action'' lawsuit filed in behalf of all the prison'sinmates contended that the suspension of visitors' privilegeswithout any due-process hearing was unlawful.   A federal trial judge ruled for the inmates, and the 6th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling last Nov. 19.   ``Given the regulatory and mandatory language (in the visitationpolicy guidelines), a liberty interest was created under thecircumstances here,'' the appeals court said.   It sent the case back to a trial judge to determine ``theparticular procedural process due the (inmates) when visitation isdenied.''   In seeking Supreme Court review, state officials said theappeals court ruling _ potentially binding law in Kentucky, Ohio,Michigan and Tennessee _ could ``inhibit substantially correctionsofficials from drafting policies that may confer a benefit on aninmate.''   Kentucky's appeal said the 6th Circuit court's ruling couldaffect such inmate benefits as honor housing, furloughs, work andstudy programs, outside trips, recreation, escorted leaves andinmate clubs.   ``Finding that such policies create a constitutionally protectedinterest is untenable,'' the appeal contended.   The case is Kentucky vs. Thompson, 87-1815.</TEXT></DOC>
