Al-Sowayegh said he expected onlythat the Saudi flag would be hoisted atop the embassy in Tehran.;    Askedwhether there would be an immediate exchange of ambassadors, he said he wasnot aware whether a decision had been made.;    No one answered the phone atthe Iranian Embassy in Riyadh on Monday morning, but that was not unusual in aMuslim country during the fasting month of Ramadan when daytime life slows toa crawl.;    A reporter who drove to the embassy said the palm treessurrounding the embassy were dead. A diplomatic source said that was becausethe Saudis cut off water when relations were cut in 1988. A lone Saudi guardstood outside the locked gate.;    Iran's state-run Tehran Times, whichreflects official thinking, said earlier this month that the resumption ofties follows agreement on the number of Iranians to be allowed in this year'spilgrimage, or hajj.;    The Times, quoting anonymous sources in Tehran, saidRiyadh has agreed to allow 110,000 Iranians on the pilgrimage this year, morethan twice the number allowed previously.;    Riyadh will also allow Iraniandemonstrations in the hajj, as long as they stay where the Iranian contingentwill be housed, according to sources reached in Tehran who spoke on conditionof anonymity.;    There has been no official comment from Riyadh either on thenumber of Iranian pilgrims or the issue of demonstrations, the two key Iraniandemands for restoration of ties.;    Riyadh severed ties with Iran in April1988, accusing it of terrorism and subversion, after 400 pilgrims, mostlyIranians, were killed in clashes with Saudi police while attempting to stagedemonstrations during the hajj against the kingdom.;    Iran has boycotted thehajj since, insisting the quota system be abolished and the pilgrims beallowed to stage rallies.;    Until last year, the Iranians were openlycalling for the overthrow of the Saudi ruling family, on grounds they wereunfit as guardians of the holy cities.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910326  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  468  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 26, 199100086084,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
