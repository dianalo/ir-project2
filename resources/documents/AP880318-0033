The low-key uprising led by Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., came to aseemingly harmonious head Thursday when the self-proclaimed ``Groupof Nine'' unveiled a compromise plan to escalate the battle againsturban pollution.   Their effort drew applause from the targets of their end-runaround the committee system: Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., andRep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health and theenvironment subcommittee. The details of their plan didn't.   Swift and his allies effectively took over the committee's airquality deliberations last December after months of fruitlesswrangling between Dingell and Waxman, the sponsor of an air qualitybill endorsed by environmentalists but deadlocked in hissubcommittee with a 10-10 split.   ``It's a legislative product,'' Swift told a news conference.``None of us is happy with every last detail. ... This is a goodpiece of environmental policy, and it's cost effective.''   Their plan in many ways is similar to Waxman's bill and oneproduced last year by the Senate Environment Committee but stillawaiting a call to the floor by a major foe, Majority Leader RobertByrd, D-W.Va.   Each proposal calls for stricter emissions controls on industryand automobiles in an effort to reduce the carbon monoxide andsmog-producing ozone that the Environmental Protection Agency sayshave reached unhealthy levels for some 100 million people living in60 or so metropolitan areas.   The group's plan, however, would give states and localities moretime to come up with plans to cut pollution, from three to 16years, depending on the severity of their problems.   The plan would leave most remedies up to EPA and the states, butat minimum a city falling short of clean air standards would haveto institute a vehicle inspection and maintenance program.   Swift and Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said group members wouldbegin working next week on an acid rain plan, which has also beendivisive.   Dingell, from an automaking district, has been firm againstcalls for cleaner vehicle exhausts, saying the retirement of oldervehicles lacking emissions controls will cause vehicular pollutionto continue to decrease.   In a prepared statement, Dingell said the Group of Nine plan is``a vast improvement'' over Waxman's bill and has a ``realopportunity to gain my full support.''   Waxman called the proposal a ``very constructive step.''   Earl Mallich, chairman of industry's Clean Air Working Group,said the proposed tailpipe standards may not be technologicallyachievable. R.G. Ensz, spokesman for the American PetroleumInstitute, said that a proposal to make fuel less evaporative wasnot cost effective.   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United Statessaid the plan for cleaner exhausts would have imperceptiblebenefits to the nation's air.   Spokesmen for the Sierra Club and Environmental Action said theywere pleased the plan called for tighter controls on industries andvehicles, but said the pace of controls was too slow.   Other members of the Swift group are Mike Synar, D-Okla.; PhilSharp, D-Ind.; Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.; Jim Slattery, D-Kan.; BillTauzin, D-La.; and Rick Boucher, D-Va.</TEXT></DOC>
