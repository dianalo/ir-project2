It is available to a person who after June 30, 1985, enlists, reelistsor extends an enlistment as a Reserve for service in the Selected Reserve;or to a person who, after then same date, is appointed as, or is servingas a reserve officer in the Selected Reserve and agrees to serve in theSelected Reserve for an additional period of at least six years.

Schaeffer (225), AssistantDirector for Education Policy and Program Administration, Vocational Rehabilitationand Education Service, Department of Veterans Benefits, Veterans Administration,810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233-2092.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On pages 44054 through 44073 of the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 17, 1987, there was published a noticeof intent to amend 30 CFR, Part 21 to provide a new Subpart L. SubpartL contains the regulations the VA will use in administering the MontgomeryGI Bill_Selected Reserve. Interested people were given 31 days to submitcomments, suggestions or objections. The Veterans Administration (VA),the Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation receivedthree letters containing comments. Two were from officials of an educationalorganization; one was from a university official.The three letter writers had three comments in common. First, they commentedthat these rules merely follow complex rules which the VA has used formany years to administer other GI Bill education benefit programs. Thewriters thought that more modern approaches to regulation of the new programwould be appropriate. Second, the writers thought that these regulationsshould not be made final until the Commission on Veterans' Education Policy(the Commission) established by section 320 of the Veterans' Benefits Improvementand Health Care Authorization Act of 1986, issues its final report. Third,they noted with disapproval that the rules do not take into account somechanges to the Montgomery GI Bill_Selected Reserve enacted by the Veterans'Benefits Improvement and Health Care Authorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L.99-576) and the New GI Bill Continuation Act (Pub. L. 100-48). These concernsare addressed below.These regulations contain many new provisions which implement distinctivechapter 106 provisions (e.g. eligibility requirements, criteria for determininga reservist's delimiting date, permissible type of training). However,this series of regulations also contains many provisions similar to thoseimplementing the other education benefits programs administered by theVA. We view this as perfectly consistent with the mandate of 10 U.S.C.2136 which directs that various enumerated provisions of chapters 34 and36 of Title 38 United States Code shall apply to provision of assistanceunder the Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve.We believe that the Congress clearly intended that the Selected Reserveprogram, at least to the extent governed by the same statutory provisions,was to be administered in the same manner as the Vietnam Era GI Bill program.The agencies responsible for this program find no reason to alter the coextensiveprovisions, and, therefore, opt to apply them as written.The VA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportationdo not believe implementation of these regulations should be deferred pendingthe issuance of a final report by the Commission for two reasons. First,these regulations govern the period beginning October 19, 1984, and mustbe issued to assure that the public and VA staff may understand the correctlegal procedures applicable to cases which arose after that date and which,therefore, are governed by these rules. Second, it appears that the finalreport on the matters studied by the Commission will not be issued untillate in 1990, and the Commission's recommendations will likely be subjectto Congressional action before being adopted. To wait until completionof these actions would mean that no rules would exist for possible eightor more years following enactment of Pub. L. 98-525, an unacceptable delay.The comment letters also note that these regulations do not implement provisionsof two recent laws, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement and Health CareAuthorization Act of 1986, and the New GI Bill Continuation Act. Regulatorychanges needed to implement those laws, which are effective at times subsequentto these regulations, are being prepared separately for notice and comment.They will be issued later. Separate chronological publication of the regulationsrequired by each statutory revision will assure proper adjudication ofquestions concerning claims which arise following each change in law.In addition to the three comments which the three letters had in common,one writer objected that the date on which these regulations appeared inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> fell during a time when schools were not in normalsession, producing the likelihood that school officials would be unableto meet the deadline for submitting comments. These regulations were publishedon November 17, 1987, before most schools began their Thanksgiving vacation.The comment period ended on December 18, 1987, before most schools begantheir breaks for Christmas. Significantly, one of the letters actuallywas received from a university official. The agencies believe that interestedparties did have adequate notice and find no reason to extend the commentperiod.One of those commenting objected to the retroactive effective date forthese regulations. As explained when the regulations were proposed, theVA finds that good cause exists for making these regulations, like thesections of the law they implement, retroactively effective on October19, 1984. To achieve the maximum benefit of this legislation for the affectedindividuals, it is necessary to implement these provisions of law as soonas possible. A delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design;would complicate administration of these provisions of law; and might,for want of rules by which to administer the program, result in denialof a benefit to a reservist who is entitled by law to it. Accordingly,the VA, Department of Defense and the Department of Transportation arenot accepting this suggestion. The regulations have a retroactive effectivedate rather than a prospective one.It has been determined that these regulations do not contain a major ruleas that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation. Theregulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy,and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for anyone. Theywill have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Administrator of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense, and theSecretary of Transportation have certified that these regulations willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5U.S.C. 601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the regulations, therefore,are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirementsof andSection;andSection;603 and 604.This certification can be made even though some small entities will haveto make the reports required in the proposed andSection;andSection;21.7652,21.7654 and 21.7656. The records needed to make the reports are maintainedby educational institutions in the normal course of business. Hence, theregulations will not impose any additional recordkeeping costs on the smallentities. Some costs will result from making the reports. However, thereports themselves are required by law. While the law allows some leewayin setting the frequency of these reports, in those instances where theVA has chosen a frequency greater than that required by law, the agencydoes not believe the economic impact of the regulations to be significant.Furthermore, part of the cost of making these reports is offset by thereporting fee which the law requires the VA to pay to educational institutions.The regulations will have no economic impact on other small entities suchas small governmental units.The information collection requirement of andSection;21.7530(a) has receivedOMB control number 2900-0154. The information collection requirement ofandSection;21.7640 has areceived OMB control number 2900-0073. The informationcollection requirement of andSection;21.7654 has received OMB control number2900-0354. The information collection requirement of andSection;21.7656 hasreceived OMB control number 2900-0156.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the program affectedby this regulation are 12.609 and 64.124.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21</ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs-education, Loan programs-education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: April 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.
