The currency also benefited from a continued positive reassessment of the U.S. economy.    For days, the foreign-exchange market has been abuzz with rumors that finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- known as the Group of Five, or G5 -- will meet to try to stabilize volatile currency markets and support the dollar.    That speculation has been fueled by a current meeting in Florence, Italy, where senior finance and treasury officials from the Group of Seven -- the Group of Five plus Italy and Canada -- are preparing an agenda for the June economic summit. Currency dealers contended that the officials also could make preparations for a meeting on monetary and currency matters.    &quot;Whenever senior government officials meet, it's natural for traders to anticipate all possible outcomes,&quot; said James Vick, senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;In this case, that includes the possibility of a G-5 meeting on currencies.&quot;    Despite the speculation about a meeting, monetary sources yesterday said no firm decisions had been made.    Most of the dollar's climb yesterday occurred in early European trading, where the currency also was buoyed by rumors, which proved untrue, that U.S. forces had begun an invasion of Lebanon.    In an attempt to damp speculation about possible U.S. military action in Lebanon, the Pentagon said later in the day that one of two aircraft carriers patrolling off Lebanon would begin a port call and that four of its escort vessels would return home.    Meanwhile, expectations persisted that the Bank of Japan will lower its discount rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 2.5%. Some Japanese press reports have predicted a rate cut will come as soon as early next week. While the move has been expected for some time, lower Japanese rates would reduce the yen's attraction to speculators.    Koichi Tsukihara, senior analyst at Sumitomo Bank in Tokyo, said the timing of a Japanese discount-rate cut is linked to prospects for a G-5 meeting. Tokyo analysts believe the Bank of Japan is resisting U.S. pressure to cut the key rate until they can secure an agreement on a coordinated effort to support the dollar.    Analysts argued that a discount-rate cut wouldn't significantly stimulate Japan's economy -- something that Washington has been pushing Tokyo to do for some time. Hidehiro Iwaki, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, said a rate cut would do little to boost the economy because there already is ample liquidity in the banking system.    Regarding the U.S. economy, dealers and economists said that a continued reassessment of fundamentals has given the dollar some temporary support.    Anne Parker Mills, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., noted that recent positive U.S. statistics for leading economic indicators, new factory orders and single-family home sales contrasted with recent West German data. Those figures pointed to higher German inflation and unemployment, plus falling industrial production. Yesterday, the German Economics Department reported that new manufacturing orders for December were unchanged from November.    In addition, a week ago, the Commerce Department said that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $10.66 billion in December from a revised $15.44 billion deficit in November and the $19.22 billion deficit originally reported for that month.    Many traders are watching to see whether today's release of January U.S. employment data confirms the positive tone of other recent U.S. indicators. In fact, one of the factors boosting the dollar yesterday was traders covering short, or oversold, dollar positions ahead of the employment number, said William G. Orsini, corporate foreign-exchange manager for Bank of Montreal in New York.    &quot;Despite the fact that the trade number will probably be significantly revised, it still points to a considerably less discouraging picture of U.S. trade than the one we were looking at a week ago,&quot; said Ms. Mills. Because of this sentiment, analysts said some money managers are now looking for opportunities to sell foreign currencies short. In a short sale, traders sell borrowed currencies on the expectation that they will be able to buy them back at a lower rate.    Moreover, despite worries that the Bundesbank would continue to tighten monetary policy even after cutting its discount and Lombard rates two weeks ago, the West German central bank has aggressively lowered interest rates by adding liquidity to the banking system. That, said Ms. Mills, has enhanced the dollar's appeal by widening the difference between Eurodollar interest rates and their German equivalent to more than two percentage points, compared with a little more than one point in December.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8365 West German marks and 153.62 yen, up from 1.8150 marks and 152.75 yen on Wednesday. The British pound fell to $1.5185 from $1.5225.    Traders noted that even though it declined against the dollar, Britain's currency advanced against those of its European trading partners, because oil prices rose after falling for three straight days.    Another currency that has held firm lately has been the Canadian dollar. But yesterday, John Crow, governor of the Bank of Canada, told reporters in Ottawa that he felt the currency's current level was reasonable. That was enough to knock the Canadian unit down to 74.81 U.S. cents from 75.16 cents, said traders, who speculated that Mr. Crow was concerned about a rising currency hurting Canada's exports. The Canadian dollar stood at 74.78 U.S. cents in late New York trading, down from 75.52 cents Wednesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $404.80 an ounce, up $2.10. Estimated volume was a heavy five million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $404.15 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Masayoshi Kanabayashi.    ---                     CURRENCY RATES                       New York    Home Mkt.
