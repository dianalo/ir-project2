Lorch. Terms weren't disclosed.    An Ampco-Pittsburgh spokesman declined to say whether Wyckoff, which makes steel bars and shapes at plants in Chicago, Michigan and Connecticut, was profitable, but the division's sales are believed to represent about 15% of the company's sales.    Ampco-Pittsburgh, hit hard by the recession in heavy industry, had a 1986 net loss of $46.3 million on sales of $381 million, compared with year-earlier earnings of $3.4 million on sales of $403.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
