Thekey recommendations of the workshop were that (1) a limited understandingof sorption phenomena will be needed to demonstrate reasonable assuranceof compliance with regulatory repository-performance requirements; (2)understanding of sorption phenomena must be developed through laboratorystudies complemented by field studies and consideration of natural analogues;(3) both site-specific and more fundamental laboratory studies designedto elucidate sorption mechanisms will be necessary components of a successfulsorption program; (4) methods of modeling sorption that are more sophisticatedthan the single-value K/sub D/ model will be needed to support repository-performanceassessments; and (5) the level of sophistication of sorption models willdepend on the radionuclide(s) of interest, available supporting laboratorydata, and the level of isolation performance assigned to sorption processes.</TEXT></DOC>
