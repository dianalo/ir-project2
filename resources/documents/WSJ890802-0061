GENETICS, BOTH THE SCIENCE and its companion art and industry of gene-splicing, got a dramatic boost in 1953, when three young scientists at England's Cambridge University drew the shape of the basic building-block of heredity, DNA, shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid.    Two years before, James D. Watson, a 24-year-old Chicagoan with a Ph.D. in biology, had teamed with Francis Crick, 36, a British physicist-turned biologist, to find the molecular structure of DNA. Their secret weapon was unpublished X-ray diffraction photos taken earlier by British biochemist Maurice Wilkins. Their shadowy outlines hinted that DNA's molecular shape was a double spiral.    Watson and Crick lived in mortal fear that Linus Pauling, the two-time Nobel Prize-winning Calfornia chemist, would beat them, even without Wilkin's photographs. A relieved Watson learned that Pauling was postulating a triple spiral instead of the Crick-Watson double helix.    The Cambridge team completed its DNA model, made up of wire and colored beads. They had pictured DNA -- correctly -- as a double rope ladder, its sides composed of sugars and phosphates, its steps alternating pairs of adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine.    Celebrating their success at a Cambridge pub, Crick toasted the discovery of &quot;the secret of life.&quot; He wasn't far wrong. DNA holds the secret of how heredity works, how cells are directed and controlled in future generations.    Watson shared the 1962 Nobel Prize with Crick and Wilkins and is still a major force in genetics. He is now associate director of the &quot;genome&quot; project, a plan to may DNA in the human body. Its scope can be shown by one statistic -- each human cell holds a billion pairs of nucleotides, subunits of DNA. The National Institutes of Health estimates that the mapping will take 15 years and will cost at least $3 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
