Valium and Xanax have a variety of legitimate uses and areprescribed to relieve stress, anxiety, panic attacks and enhancesleep and relax muscles.   Barry, who commented after returning Washington after treatmentfor chemical dependency, did not say if the pills had beenprescribed. Aides have said Barry's major problem was alcholism.   The mayor, who left Washington seven weeks ago to begintreatment, faces five misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession andthree felony charges of perjury before a grand jury.   Gene Haislip, deputy assistant administrator for the DrugEnforcement Administration's office of diversion control, says thetwo drugs are among the pharmaceuticals most frequently divertedfrom the legitimate market.   A total of 9.5 million Americans surveyed in 1988 for theNational Household Survey on Drug Abuse said they had usedtranquilizers _ including but not limited to Valium and Xanax _non-medically at least once in their lives, according to Mona Brownof the National Institute on Drug Abuse.   In addition, 1.2 million Americans said they had used such drugsnon-medically in the 30 days before the survey was conducted, Brownsaid.   In 1988, use of Valium was mentioned in 6,082 emergency roomcases and Xanax was reported 3,846 times, according to NIDA.   One prominent case occurred in February 1987, when formerpresidential adviser Robert C. McFarlane, under investigation inthe Iran-Contra scandal, attempted suicide with an overdose ofValium.   Valium and Xanax are rarely fatal when taken alone, ``but if youmix them with alcohol, they can be deadly,'' Hoehn-Saric said,adding that Valium is the more addictive.   ``It gives you a quick high,'' he said. ``People who areaddicted are looking for that high.''   Xanax, meanwhile, is ``like a drink here and there to helprelieve stress,'' he said. ``But if it's used frequently _ likemorning, noon and night _ it becomes addictive.''   Hoehn-Saric said Valium withdrawal can mean sleeplessness andanxiety. If the person has been taking high doses, he said, ``itcould cause seizures if you withdraw too fast.''   Dr. Brian Doyle, a clinical professor of psychiatry atGeorgetown University Hospital, said it takes six to 12 weeks toget off the drugs for people who have been taking it under medicalsupervision in appropriate doses. Recreational users taking higherdoses need longer, he said.   In recent years, physicians have reduced their prescriptions ofValium as they became aware of the addiction potential, Hoehn-Saricsaid.   The use of the tranquilizers were so widespread during the 1970sthat it became part of the popular culture and a subject for humor.   In a memorable scene from the 1977 movie, ``An UnmarriedWoman,'' starring Jill Clayburgh and Alan Bates, a department storecrowd is asked if anyone has a Valium. Everyone in sightimmediately reaches for his or her personal supply.</TEXT></DOC>
