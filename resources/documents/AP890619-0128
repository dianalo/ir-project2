Such steps could involve trial inspections at each other'smissile sites and estabishment of technical groups to discussequipment needed for verification measures.   Bush announced his proposal as U.S. and Soviet negotiators met inGeneva to resume strategic arms reduction talks (START) after aseven-month recess.   The talks, aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range bombers,land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50percent, are the latest round in negotiations that began four yearsago.   Bush said the goal was ``creating a more stable nuclear balanceand strengthening deterrence by reducing and constraining thosestrategic nuclear forces which pose the greatest threat to securityand stability.''   Bush, in a written statement, said verification may be the mostcomplex issue facing negotiators.   He said the United States was proposing that the two sides ``makea special effort to agree on and to begin implementing as soon aspossible'' verification measures and so-called stability measures.   ``Early agreement and implementation of them will speedresolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum to theefforts of our two countries to conclude expeditiously a STARTagreement,'' Bush said.   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Bush's proposalprobably would be presented to the Soviets during the first plenarysession of the Geneva talks on Wednesday.   Typicially, verification is one of the last issues for thenegotiators, after they have concluded how deeply they are going tocut weapons, Popadiuk said.   ``We're going to put an added emphasis on verification upfront,'' he said.   The press spokesman insisted, however, ``we are not puttingverification first. ... We continue to work on verfication and otheraspects of the START treaty simultaneously.   Popadiuk said the emphasis on verification ``involves nopreconditions or anything of that nature'' with regard to otheraspects of the negotiations.   However, it does represent a shift in tactics in that itenvisions putting some verification measures in place before the twosides have reached agreement on an overall treaty.   Bush said U.S. negotiators were returning to the talks ``with myfirm pledge that we will work vigorously to achieve fair andfar-reaching agreements that strengthen peace. Nothing has higherpriority.   ``I am heartened by the growing evidence that the Soviet Union isprepared to negotiate seriously about agreements that promise toreduce the risk of war,'' he said.   ``Much has already been accomplished in the negotiations; muchremains to be done.''   About 90 percent of the work was completed when the negotiationswere suspended last November.   The unfinished 10 percent contains some of the thorniest issues,such as weapons ceilings, limits on air- and sea-launched cruisemissiles, verification and how to deal with mobile missiles.   While not ruling out some adjustments from the Reaganadministration, the White House says ``there will be a considerabledegree of continuity'' in the U.S. position.</TEXT></DOC>
