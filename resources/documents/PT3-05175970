By cutting      along the raised trim and removing the panels associated therewith, on      both sides of the door, an opening is formed through the door. The opening      is peripherally bordered on both sides of the door by a raised lip left      over from the uncut, raised trim. A pair of door light rims sized to fit      the opening are connectable from opposite sides of the door to grip a door      light within the opening. The rims have outer clamp perimeters that seat      outboard of the raised lips, which serve as in-situ locators for mounting      the door light rims. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to a panel door, and more particularly, to a panel      door made from compression molded door skins having panels bordered by      integrally formed, raised trim. The trim facilitates mounting of a variety      of different door light arrangements. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Many panel doors utilized in building structures utilize an inner core      material sandwiched between two outer skins. The inner core material may      be wood, particle board, expandable polystyrene or any number of other      natural or manufactured substances. Different materials may also be      combined to form the core for a panel door. For instance, the outer frame      regions may be wood while the internal region may be a less expensive      material. The door skins may be either bent or drawn sheet metal, or      molded plastic, the skins being preferably finished with paint or varnish      to create a wood grain appearance. </PAR><PAR>  The panels of these doors are the regions that are offset by borders of      either relieved or raised trim. For a panel door, the number of panels may      vary, but the panels are usually located in a predetermined geometric      pattern with respect to the shape of the door. Many panel doors also      include some combination of panels and door lights, i.e., windows. The      door light locations also form a geometric pattern with respect to the      panels. One aspect of this invention relates to providing selectability      and versatility in arranging the locations of the panels and the door      lights of a panel door. </PAR><PAR>  According to one method of mounting a door light to a panel door, the door      skins are precut in the locations where the door lights are eventually to      be mounted. A pair of the precut skins are then adhesively sandwiched upon      a core material, thereby aligning the precut openings of the skins. The      door lights are then mounted within the openings to complete the door. </PAR><PAR>  Unfortunately, this method of manufacture requires that the locations of      the door lights be known at the outset of production, thereby      necessitating a longer lead time because production cannot be initiated      until a particular door panel/door light configuration is chosen. While a      large number of panel doors of various door light arrangements could be      mass produced in an effort to reduce lead time, this solution requires      continuous maintenance of a relatively large inventory. If one particular      door light configuration were to become unpopular, it would remain in      inventory beyond its useful life, resulting in a waste of material. In      short, this manner of providing selectability in choosing a door pattern      results in delay and possibly, a higher priced panel door. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore preferable to first sandwich the core with two opposing      skins, and then cut the holes for mounting the door lights, after a      particular design has been selected. Because this method employs a      relatively precise cutting step, care must be taken to assure that holes      for mounting the door lights will be in vertical and horizontal alignment      with the edges of the door and/or with the other uncut panels of the door.      If a cutting error is made, an unsatisfactory door will result, or the      material must be scrapped altogether. The requirement for precision      cutting translates into an increased labor cost for the final panel door.      In a sense, while this method somewhat reduces the lead time associated      with manufacturing a panel door with a selected door light configuration,      it also produces an increased labor cost in the form of an extra, precise      cutting step. </PAR><PAR>  For either of these two methods, the final production step involves      mounting the door lights within the prescribed openings. Opposing rims      secure the door light to the door within the opening. The rims are      connectable from opposite sides of the door and have peripheral regions      that contact and clamp upon the door skins on opposite sides of the      opening. A bead of hot melt caulking or molding is then applied to the      skin around the opening to seal or weatherproof the rims. This molding is      shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 of U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,669, a patent owned by      applicant. </PAR><PAR>  Unfortunately, while the use of molding is considered necessary to seal the      rims, the bead is susceptible to separation from the door skin, and its      application represents a labor-intensive production step that results in a      higher priced door. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore an object of the invention to reduce the labor costs      normally associated with providing selectability in the arrangement of      door panels and door lights in a panel door. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the invention to provide a door skin for use in a      panel door wherein the skins facilitate secure attachment of a door light. </PAR><PAR>  It is still another object of the invention to provide a versatile door      skin that may be advantageously utilized in any one of a variety of      selectable panel/door light configurations. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention contemplates a molded door skin with a plurality of panels,      each of the panels bordered by integrally formed, raised trim that      protrudes outwardly with respect to one of the surfaces, the surface that      will become one of the exteriorly directed surfaces of the finished, panel      door. </PAR><PAR>  With two such panels sandwiched upon a core, a plurality of panel cross      sections are formed. An opening substantially concentric with the former      location of at least one of the panel cross sections is formed by cutting      through the skins and core along an inner periphery of the raised trim      associated with the panel or panels, and then removing the skin and core      material therebetween. This produces a raised lip that substantially      surrounds the opening, the raised lip being a left-over portion remaining      after the raised trim has been cut. </PAR><PAR>  The raised lip serves as an in-situ locator that facilitates subsequent      mounting of a rim to the skin. The raised lip also alleviates the need to      apply a separate bead of molding or caulking around the opening to      weatherproof the rim. If only one panel is removed and a door light is to      be sized to occupy the opening that remains after the single panel is      removed, the raised lip completely surrounds the opening, and acts as a      seal that keeps water out of the core of the door. If more than one panel      is removed from a door light, a weatherproofing bead is preferably applied      in alignment with the raised lip. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a panel door      with one or more door lights mounted therein includes two compression      molded plastic door skins that sandwich a wood periphery and a foamed      central core. Each of the skins has a plurality of panels, and each panel      has an integrally molded border that includes raised trim which protrudes      outwardly from one surface of the door skin. When sandwiching the core,      the panels of the skins are aligned to form panel cross sections.      According to one preferred embodiment, each skin has six rectangular      panels, including a lower pair and a middle pair of vertically oriented,      elongated panels and an upper pair of panels with a relatively shorter      vertical dimension. For reasons to be explained later, the panels of one      or more of the pairs may have a slightly greater width than the other      panels. </PAR><PAR>  By cutting along the raised trim and removing one or more of the panel      cross sections, a door light may be mounted to the door in a selectable      location, a location which is geometrically configured or aligned with      respect to the remaining, uncut panels. For a door light that occupies      only one of the panel cross sections, the cutting and removing step forms      an opening completely surrounded by a raised lip, the raised lip being      left over from the uncut raised trim. Opposing door light rims connect      together from opposite sides of the door to hold a door light in place      within the opening. The rims are oversized with respect to the opening and      have internal and external clamp perimeters. When connected from opposite      sides of the door, the inner clamp perimeters grip a door light from      opposite sides to hold the door light in place. The outer clamp perimeters      seat exteriorly of the raised lips that border the opening. Preferably,      the outer clamp perimeters have cross sectional shapes that fit snugly      over the raised lips to maintain the position of the rims. </PAR><PAR>  Because the outer clamp perimeters extend outwardly of the raised lips, the      door light rim necessarily extends slightly beyond the other uncut panel      cross sections that were initially in vertical alignment therewith. If it      is known beforehand which one or more of the vertically aligned panel      cross sections are to be removed for mounting of door lights, the skins      may be molded so that the other remaining panels will have a slightly      greater width. This greater width somewhat compensates for the horizontal      extension of the rim, so that the outward protrusion is not readily      apparent when looking at the door. Applicant has found that a panel width      increased by 1/4&quot;, i.e., 1/8&quot; on each side, has proved suitable for this      purpose. However, if desired, the panels could also be molded to extend a      1/4&quot; width on each side, thereby directly aligning the outer perimeters of      the mounted light rims with the raised trim of the uncut panel cross      sections. </PAR><PAR>  In order to form a panel door with mounted door lights in accordance with a      preferred embodiment of the invention, a pair of fiber reinforced      polyester door skins are compression molded. The two door skins are then      adhesively secured together upon a core material, preferably sandwiching a      wood perimeter and an insulator in the central regions of the door. The      sandwiching step aligns the panels of each of the skins to form panel      cross sections. </PAR><PAR>  When it is determined which and how many of the panel cross sections are to      be removed and replaced by door lights, the raised trim surrounding the      appropriate panel cross section or cross sections is/are cut and the skins      and core material associated therewith are then removed. This cutting step      forms an opening located where the panel cross section or cross sections      was/were previously located, the opening substantially surrounded by a      raised lip left over from the cut trim. </PAR><PAR>  If a door light is to occupy the cross-sectional area of one panel cross      section, the raised lip will completely surround the opening. If a door      light is to occupy two adjacently situated panel cross sections, and the      area therebetween, some cutting must be performed beyond the molded trim      of one panel cross section and through the unpaneled portion of the skin      and into the aligned molded, raised trim of the next adjacently situated      panel. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, if a door light is to occupy the space from four panel cross      sections, and the area therebetween, the cut must surround all four of the      panel cross sections and the door skin areas residing therein. Regardless      of the number of panel cross sections removed, the resulting opening will      be substantially concentric with the former position of at least one of      the panels, and the resulting raised lip will substantially surround the      opening, on both external surfaces of the door. </PAR><PAR>  A pair of connectable door light rims are then brought together from      opposite sides of the door upon a door light within the opening. The rims      have inner clamp peripheries that grip the door light therebetween and      outer clamp perimeters that seat exteriorly of the raised lips.      Preferably, the rims are connected by tightening mounting screws through      aligned holes. </PAR><PAR>  The raised lips that substantially surround the opening serve as in-situ      locators which facilitate mounting of a door light to the door. The      integrally formed raised lips alleviate the need to separately apply a      bead of molding or caulking around the opening to mount the door light      rim, thereby eliminating a labor step and the cost of the bead material.      The raised trim also facilitates precise cutting of the openings at the      positions where the door lights are to be mounted. Finally, because the      raised lip is integral with the door skin, it is not susceptible to      separation from the door, a problem that currently exists when a bead      alone is applied for weather-proofing. </PAR><PAR>  Another advantageous aspect of the invention relates to the versatility in      the number of door light arrangements that may be mounted to one standard,      panel door made from compression molded skin. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to increased versatility, the invention streamlines the method      of manufacturing a panel door with door lights, resulting in reduced      costs. </PAR><PAR>  These and other features of the invention will be more readily appreciated      in view of the following detailed description and the drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a panel door to which one or more door      lights are to be mounted in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 a cross-sectional view taken along lines 2--2 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an enlarged partial cross-sectional view that shows a cut line      through a panel door. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an enlarged partial cross-section, similar to FIG. 3, which shows      a door light mounted to a panel door in accordance with a preferred      embodiment of the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a panel door 10 that has been formed in accordance with a      preferred embodiment of the invention, prior to cutting and removal of      selected panels for the purpose of mounting one or more door lights      thereon. The door 10 includes molded door skins 11 and 12 which sandwich a      core 13. Preferably, the skin material is compression molded fiber      reinforced polyester. This preferable material is 45-50% calcium      carbonate, by weight, 20-40% fiberglass, by weight, 10-20% polyester      resin, by weight, 1% zinc stearate, by weight and 0-1% pigment, by weight.      Core 13 may be of any material that provides sufficient support for the      door. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 2, the external periphery of the door      10 has a core of wood 14, with a modified expandable polystyrene 15      utilized in the central region. Expandable polystyrene material may be      molded to the proper shape and is preferable because of its insulation      capabilities and relatively low cost. However, the physical materials      utilized for the door skins 11 and 12 and/or the core are not particularly      pertinent to the invention, so long as the skins have a cross sectional      shape that enables the invention to be produced. </PAR><PAR>  Door skins 11 and 12 include a plurality of panels. When sandwiched on the      core 13, the panels from the separate skins are aligned to form panel      cross sections Numerals 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 designate the      rectangular panel cross sections shown in FIG. 1. Preferably, door 10 has      a lower pair of vertically oriented, elongated panel cross sections 17 and      18, middle pair of vertically oriented, elongated panel cross sections 19      and 20, and an upper pair of panel cross sections 21 and 22 that are      relatively shorter in vertical dimension. The planar surface of each of      the panels may be contiguous with, recessed from, or protruding outwardly      from the external surface of respective door skins, though it is generally      preferable that all the planar surfaces be located in the same plane. </PAR><PAR>  When specifically referring to the panels of skin 11, the letter &quot;a&quot; will      be appended to the corresponding panel section number. Similarly, the      letter &quot;b&quot; will be used to designate panels from skin 12. Each panel is      surrounded peripherally by a border. The borders are designated generally      by numerals 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32 corresponding to panels 17, 18, 19,      20, 21 and 22, respectively. The letters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are also appended to      numerals 27-31 when referring to the particular skins for which the      borders are associated. An external portion of each border protrudes      outwardly from the outwardly directed skin surfaces of the door 10. This      external portion of the border is referred to as the raised trim. These      raised trim border portions are indicated by appending a &quot;c&quot; or &quot;d&quot; onto      the border numerals 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32, with &quot;c&quot; indicating raised      trim of skin 11 and &quot;d&quot; indicating raised trim of skin 12, as shown in      FIG. 2. Although a wide variety of border configurations would be      suitable, it is important that the outermost peripheral portion of each      border protrude outwardly from the outwardly directed surfaces of the      sandwiching door skins. </PAR><PAR>  Cutting away of an internal peripheral portion of the raised trim produces      a raised lip which is ultimately used for locating, seating and sealing a      rim for mounting a door light to a door, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. FIG. 3      shows a cut line 36, which indicates the location where the door 10 will      be cut. After cutting around a panel by cutting along the border of a      panel cross section, i.e.., border 29 in FIG. 3, the disconnected panels      19a and 19b, most of the borders 29a and 29b, including most of raised      trim 29c and 29d, and core material 15 located therebetween are removed to      form an opening indicated by numeral 37 (see FIG. 4). The only remaining      external portions of the borders 29a and 29b are raised lips left over      from the raised trim 29c and 29d, respectively. These raised lips protrude      outwardly from skins 11 and 12 and are designated by numerals 29e and 29f,      respectively. </PAR><PAR>  With the panels and the core material removed, a pair of connectable rims      41 and 42 are centered with respect to the opening 37 from opposite sides      of the door 10. Preferably, the rims are connectable by aligned,      internally threaded bores 43 and 44 and an externally threaded screw 45.      Each rim includes an outer clamp perimeter that seats exteriorly of the      raised lip around the opening 37, as shown in FIG. 4. Each rim also has an      inner clamp perimeter that grips an outer periphery of the door light 47.      As shown in FIG. 4, with respect to one rim 41, outer clamp periphery 49      seats exteriorly of raised lip 29e and inner clamp perimeter 50 grips door      light 47. With respect to another rim 42, outer clamp perimeter 52 seats      exteriorly of raised lip 29f and inner clamp perimeter 53 grips door light      47. With the outer perimeters seated exteriorly of the respective raised      lips, and the inner perimeters gripping the door light 47 therebetween,      the rims 41 and 42 are connected together by screw 45 to complete mounting      of the door light 47 to the door 10. As shown in FIG. 4, the external      shape of the rims 41 and 42 is substantially similar to the shape of the      border that was removed. </PAR><PAR>  If a door light is to be mounted within an opening formerly occupied by      only one panel cross section, the left over uncut raised lip will      completely surround the opening formed by cutting and removing along the      raised trim. However, if a door light is to be mounted within area      occupied by two adjacently situated panels along with the surface area      located therebetween, cutting of the door skin will not be performed      entirely along raised trim, but will also extend around the surface area      located therebetween. For example, if panel cross sections 20 and 22 are      to be used, area 58 bordered by dashed line 59 must also be removed. For      this arrangement, cutting would be performed along line 59, which      encircles panels 20 and 22 and most of their respective borders and area      58. </PAR><PAR>  As indicated previously, the standard door panel configuration shown in      FIG. 1 provides a wide degree of selectability in determining the      location, size and placement of door lights. For instance, panel cross      sections 19, 20, 21 and 22 may be removed and replaced by four separate      door lights. Alternately, panels 19 and 21 may be removed, and the surface      area 60 located therebetween also removed in order to mount a door light      having a surface area substantially defined by encircling phantom line 64.      For this configuration, it is highly likely that panels 20 and 22 would      also be removed, along with surface area 58 residing therebetween, to      mount a second door light parallel to the location designated by      encircling phantom line 64. </PAR><PAR>  According to still another alternative, panels 19, 20, 21 and 22 may all be      removed along with the raised trim within lines 64 and 59, and also area      65 located between lines 66 and 67, thereby to mount a relatively large      door light within the opening. A number of other variations would be      possible by rearranging the geometric configuration of the individual      panel and the locations of the panel cross sections. </PAR><PAR>  In these arrangements, the lip 29 substantially surrounds the opening. In      the context of this application, the word substantially means greater than      50% of the opening perimeter. </PAR><PAR>  Outward seating of the outer perimeters of the rims places the rims about a      1/4&quot; beyond the raised lips. While outward protrusion of the rim with      respect to other aligned panels may be visually noticeable, it is not      readily apparent. Nevertheless, it may be desirable to provide oversized      panels adjacent to locations of eventual door light mounting, thereby      minimizing the misalignment between the raised trim and the rim of an      adjacently situated door light. For the configuration shown, this outward      protrusion is about 1/4&quot;. Applicant has learned that an increased panel      width of 1/8&quot; on both sides sufficiently reduces the misalignment so as to      render it unnoticeable to most observers. In FIG. 1, for instance, panel      17 is shown having a slightly greater width than the panels located      thereabove. </PAR><PAR>  While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described, applicant      does not wish to be limited thereby, and it is to be understood that      various modifications could be made without departing from the spirit of      the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that changes may be      made without departing from the scope of the invention as particularly set      out and claimed. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
