ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corporate executives contemplating mergers havea stronger arsenal against unwanted buyout bids now that theDelaware Supreme Court has upheld Time Inc.'s right to proceed withits buyout of Warner Communications Inc., legal scholars saidTuesday.   Coming at the end of a decade dominated by hostile takeovers,Monday's decision forcing Paramount Communications Inc. to end itshostile $12.2 billion bid for Time ``provides a measure of calm tothe boardrooms of Delaware corporations,'' said James D. Cox, a lawprofessor at Duke University.   ``There was a basically misguided malaise that Delaware wasneedlessly and recklessly championing the cause of bidders and notproviding sufficient deference to incumbent management,'' Cox said.   Now, Cox said, ``The idea is companies are allowed to formulatebusiness policies such as engaging in a large and costlyacquisition and to engage in those policies in the face of an offerby an outsider.''   The ruling Monday has broad implications across corporateAmerica. Many of the nation's biggest companies _ like Time,Paramount and Warner _ are incorporated in Delaware and are subjectto its laws.   Delaware's highest court upheld the decision by Chancery CourtJudge William T. Allen that the Time-Warner deal, which wasannounced three months before Paramount launched its bid in June,was the result of long-term business planning and neither Paramountnor Time shareholders could interfere.   Paramount contended that by agreeing to merge with Warner, Timeeffectively put itself up for sale and should have been forced toconsider Paramount's hostile buyout offer.   The three-judge Supreme Court announced its ruling from thebench, and was to issue a written opinion at some point in thefuture.   Delaware's exact position will be determined by the writtenopinion, Cox said, but ``the line has been more clearly drawn inthe sand as a result of the court's decision and in the facts'' ofthe Time case.   ``I would be mildly surprised if there were any substantialchanges in the rhetoric or principles from those announced inAllen's decision,'' Cox said.   Michael Bradley, a University of Michigan law professor, agreedthat the Supreme Court would ``rubber-stamp'' Allen's decision,which he said ``came came away with no basic principles changed, nonew trends.''   However, Bradley said, Allen did limit the ability of hostilebidders to attack companies and broadened the power of directors todefend against unwanted offers.   After Allen's decision, ``a merger per se is not viewed as adefensive tactic,'' Bradley said. ``A merger is seen as an ongoingoperating strategy of the firm and that does not constitute puttingthe firm on the block.''   ``You can pursue those long-range goals without fear of throwingyourself into the ring,'' Bradley said.   Bernard Black, a professor at the Columbia University School ofLaw, said the Supreme Court's support for Allen's ruling wasconsistent with Delaware's middle-of-the-road approach to takeovers.   Bradley said Allen's ruling ``follows the business judgment rulethat Delaware has long afforded corporate officers.'' The businessjudgment rule is a legal concept that generally allows decisionstaken by a board of directors to stand undisturbed if they weremade in good faith.   Delaware courts were criticized in the past year by legalexperts after decisions that aided successful hostile bids for suchcompanies as Macmillan Inc. and Pillsbury Co.   But Black said the state's support for the takeover defenseknown as the ``poison pill'' and its strong anti-takeover statutealready have given management more muscle in fighting unwanted bids.   ``Put those two together and you have to say the overall balancehas shifted fairly strongly in favor of targets,'' Black said,noting that more companies are successfully fending off hostilebids.   Observers expect the Delaware courts to deal with cases similarto the Time-Paramount battle again in the future.   For example, companies likely will claim an unwanted bidinterferes with their long-range plans. Michael Klein, an attorneyrepresenting some of Time's shareholders, predicted after Monday'sruling that lawyers will advise corporations to develop an``appearance of a long-term plan'' to ward off potential takeovers.   As companies try to use long-term plans as a shield, theDelaware courts likely will be called upon to decide in each casewhether such a strategy is a reasonable.</TEXT></DOC>
