The unit with 21 inputs,which enables to record values t=1, t=2, t=3 and t andgt; 4 during about 30-35ns is described. The described method differs from the well-known onesin the following way: along with recording signal multiplicity thereis a possibility to determine signal coordinates while detecting single-particleevents. The method is also distinguished by economical efficiency andhigh-speed response and it can be the basis for designing majority coincidencecircuits having a great number of inputs (andgt;1000).</TEXT></DOC>
