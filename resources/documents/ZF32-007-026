(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Under the assumption that it's always a good sign when a machine surpassesits rated specifications, we'd say the lights for Tandy Corp.'s sole laseroffering, the $1,599 Tandy LP 950, are all green.andP;  Powered by a Sharp laserengine, the LP 950 beat is rated speed of 6 ppm by posting 6.2 ppm on PCMagazine Labs' tests.andP;  Though you will not find many discounts on its listprice, the LP 950's small footprint, clear control panel, and 250-sheetcassette should attract those looking for a quick personal printer.andM;In its standard configuration, the LP 950 is the twin of the Dataproducts LZR650 reviewed in last year's printer blockbuster (November 13, 1990).andP;  It isalso virtually identical to the Sharp JX-9500, which is the 6-ppm version ofthe 9-ppm Sharp JX-9500H reviewed in this section.andM;The LP 950 comes with two standard fonts (Courier and Line Printer) andaccepts HP soft-font cards in two available slots.andP;  In addition to HP PCL 4,it has Diablo, Epson FX, IBM Graphics Printer, and IBM Proprinter emulations.andO;All those emulations may not be necessary, given the ubiquity of HP softwaredrivers these days, but they're good to have if you run aground on any olderprograms.andP;  On the downside, Tandy loads the LP 950 with only 512K of memory.andO;The company does offer a rather pricey $600 1.5MB memory upgrade card, andusers who print graphics-intensive pages may find it necessary.andM;Standing 11 inches tall and equipped with a parallel and a serial port, theLP 950 is a squarish, vertically designed printer with a small 13- by 15-inchfootprint for users with limited office space.andP;  Its eight-button membranekeypad with a 16-character LCD makes it easy to manage.andP;  Menu headings andchoices are displayed on the LCD readout in plain English, enabling users toselect the font, form length, symbol set, interface, emulation, and papertray.andP;  A handy reset button will restore everything to the printer's HP PCL 4defaults.andP;  Holding another button will print out a status page listing thelife remaining on the 25,000-sheet developer and 50,000-sheet photoconductorcartridges ($150 for either one), so you needn't wait for printouts to becomeblurry and washed out before changingthe cartridges.andM;Popping the top of the LP 950, however, exposes you to the inconveniences ofits three-part photoconductor system.andP;  Installing all three parts, along withthe roller cleaner and toner collection container, is fairly simple, butfirst-time users will find the instructions scant.andP;  Diagrams more precise arein order here.andP;  And no matter how adroit you may be, installing thisthree-part system means rolling up your sleeves to avoid the inevitableescape of black toner dust.andM;Tucked neatly under the LP 950 is an enclosed letter-size paper tray with acapacity of 250 sheets.andP;  Just above it on the front is a manual-feed slot fortransparencies and envelopes.andP;  When fed by hand, the LP 950 convenientlyrecognizes the input and automatically bypasses the lower tray.andP;  It willhandle a paper-weight range of 16 to 34 pounds and a variety of sizes, fromletter and legal to invoice, A4, and B5 paper sizes.andM;If you need more, an additional sheet feeder, which adds about 2.5 inches tothe printer's height, is a $350 option.andP;  Unfortunately, the sheet feeder alsorequires another letter-size or legal-size paper cassette--another $70.andP;  Anenvelope feeder, which juts out about 10 inches from the front of the LP 950,will cost you another $350.andM;Performing beyond its rated 6 ppm, on PC Magazine Labs' tests the LP 950managed a 6.2-ppm text speed--a little slower than the Sharp JX-9500PS.andP;  Ithandled the graphics speed test at 1.3 gppm, which is also a tad slower thanthe Sharp printer.andM;On the HP PCL torture test, the Tandy handled all the landscape and portraitmaneuvers with aplomb.andP;  But close inspection revealed that some output wasnot as smooth as the HP LaserJet IIP on downloaded fonts, where normallycurved edges took on a slightly jagged shape.andM;Tandy backs the LP 950 with a one-yar warranty through its Radio Shackstores.andP;  Buyers will find the LP 950's $1,599 list price a little high in thecurrent market.andP;  But Tandy's plans to offer other companies' wares in its newsuperstores may mean discounts on its own brands.andP;  If that happens,individual users should consider the LP 950 for its quick printouts and smallreal-estate demands.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
