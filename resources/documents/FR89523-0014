The amendments added requirements for random testing,a prohibition on non-medical use of controlled substances at any time (a``drug-free rule''), and new urine drug testing requirements incorporatingthe Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Procedures (53 FR 47002). TheNovember 21 issuance included the following compliance schedule:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,xs36,r20</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nov. 21<D>Published in the</D><T4> Federal Register.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dec. 21<D>Rule becomes effective (technical effective date).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">June 19<D>Railroads must submit random testing plans for approval.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July 19<D>Prohibition on non-medical drug use effective; Transportation WorkplaceDrug Testing Procedures effective.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nov. 20<D>Railroads must begin random testing.</D></ITAG></ITAG>In issuing the random testing rule and associated amendments, FRA indicatedthat further rulemaking would be required to conform the existing provisionsof the alcohol/drug regulations to the new requirements. In addition, theDepartment's Transportation Workplace Drug Testing procedures were issuedas interim final requirements, with invitation for further comments. Since last November, work has progressed on a broad front to resolve remainingdetails of the drug testing requirements and achieve early implementation.However, litigation regarding FRA's existing program did not conclude untilthe U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in<T3> Skinner</T3> v.<T3> Railway Labor Executives' Association</T3> on March 21, 1989. Followingconclusion of that litigation, FRA immediately initiated work to determineits impact and to weigh the further steps that must be taken to reconcilethe current program with the additional regulatory provisions issued lastNovember. Further, additional work has been undertaken to refine the TransportationWorkplace Drug Testing Procedures, including revision of the urine custodyand control form. These initiatives will be brought to completion overthe next few months through further rulemaking. FRA has noted the needto provide additional time to complete these activities and for the railroadsto incorporate any further guidance into their programs. Similar concernswere raised by the Association of American Railroads in a request for postponementof the implementation schedule filed on May 8, 1989.Accordingly, FRA is adjusting the compliance schedule to ensure that railroadshave complete and current guidance before embarking on the final stagesof implementation. Under the adjusted schedule, all railroads will be requiredto comply with the Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Procedures forexisting testing programs (pre-employment and reasonable cause) by October2, 1989 (formerly July 19, 1989), and the new drug-free rule will becomeeffective on that date (formerly July 19, 1989).Class I freight railroads, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation,and railroads providing commuter service will be required to submit randomtesting programs for approval by October 2, 1989 (formerly July 19, 1989),and to implement approved programs not later than January 16, 1990 (formerlyNovember 20, 1989). In addition, FRA has further reviewed the issue of compliance by smallerrailroads with the random testing requirements in light of the policiesof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the compliance schedules set by theother modal administrations, and a petition for rulemaking filed by theAmerican Short Line Railroad Association on behalf of its member railroads.FRA is persuaded that holding smaller railroads to the adjusted scheduleapplicable to large rail systems would have the following adverse effects:andbullet; Small railroads would be required to implement random testingwell ahead of other similarly situated entities, putting them at a disadvantagewith respect to the capacity of the private market to provide expert servicesin the areas of collection, medical review and quality control.andbullet; FRA would experience significant difficulty in thoroughly reviewingsmall railroad programs and providing technical guidance to ensure thatprograms are soundly constructed.andbullet; Employees of small railroads, which generally have less experiencein the field of drug testing, would be exposed to unnecessary risks ofimproperly implemented procedures because of the limited time availablefor training and the limited capacity of FRA to monitor implementation.FRA will therefore segment the regulated industry for purposes of a phasedcompliance schedule. The deadline for submission of programs by Class IIrail carriers will be April 2, 1990, with implementation of approved programsto begin not later than July 2, 1990. Class III rail carriers subject torandom testing must submit programs not later than July 2, 1990, and implementapproved programs not later than November 1, 1990. Additional time is providedfor review, approval and implementation of programs from the smallest railroadssubject to these requirements because of the number of programs involvedand the need to provide special guidance to those companies.The date on which foreign-based employees may be subject to testing isalso extended to January 1, 1991, to provide additional time for the conclusionof Departmental negotiations with foreign governments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>FRA finds that notice and opportunity for comment are not necessary becausethe effect of the amendments is to provide additional time for compliance.FRA also finds that providing such notice would be contrary to the publicinterest because regulated entities would be compelled to expend resourcesover the short term to comply with deadlines that clearly must be adjusted.FRA further finds that there is good cause for making the rule effectivein less than 30 days from the date of publication, since the amendmentsmodify current regulatory obligations and do not impose more stringentrequirements.This final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing regulatorypolicies. It is neither a ``major'' rule under Executive Order 12291 nora ``significant'' rule as defined under DOT policies and procedures. Theamendments contained in this final rule do not have any significant paperwork,Federalism, or economic impact. To the extent that any such impact exists,the amendments will lessen regulatory burdens by increasing the time availableto comply with regulations previously issued. Because the amendments donot have any significant economic impact, FRA has not prepared a regulatoryevaluation. It is certified that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 60 et seq.).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 219</ITAG>Control of alcohol and drug abuse, Railroad safety.Therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, Part 219, title 49, Codeof Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 219_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
