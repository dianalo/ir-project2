Bush, who was chief of a presidential task force on terrorism,has tried to minimize his involvement in the Iran arms sale. He hassaid ``mistakes were made,'' but claimed he was ``out of the loop''in making major policy decisions.   The congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contraaffair said Bush was present at a White House meeting on Aug. 6,1985, at which participants talked about allowing the Israelis tosell U.S.-made missiles to Iran.   President Reagan made no decision on the weapons sales,participants said. But Secretary of State George Shultz and formerSecretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger opposed the plan.   Bush has steadfastly refused to reveal his recommendations, ifany, to the president.   A few weeks later, the first shipment of TOW missiles wasdelivered to Tehran.   The Americans hoped the weapons sales would lead to freedom forU.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Ultimately,three hostages were released during the 14-month period before theshipments were shopped in November 1986.   Congressional committees and the Tower Commission made fewreferences to Bush, portraying him as a largely passive figure.   Maine senators William Cohen, a Republican, and George Mitchell,a Democrat, both members of the Iran-Contra committee, said in abook they wrote that Bush's role remains an unanswered question.They wrote that others in the Reagan administration were convincedBush had supported the plan.   ``The vice president attended several meetings on the Iraninitiative, but none of the participants recall his views,'' thereport said.   In February 1986, Bush's task force on terrorism released areport recommending that no concessions be made to terrorists.   In August 1986, Bush visited Jerusalem, where he received abriefing on the arms-for-hostages deal from Amiram Nir, an Israeliofficial who had worked with National Security Council officials onthe deal.   Nir said the weapons sales were designed to ``get and hostagesout,'' as well as to ``build better contact with Iran. Nir told thevice president: ``We are dealing with the most radical elements''in Iran, according to the congressional report.   But Bush did not comment except to thank Nir for pursuing theinitiative ``despite doubts and reservations throughout theprocess.''   The congressional committees also concluded Bush was not toldabout the diversion of money from the weapons sales to the Contrarebels.   Donald Gregg, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, had extensiveknowledge about certain elements of the resupply operation for theContras, but did not tell Bush about it, the report said.   ``The vice president said he did not know of the Contra resupplyoperation,'' the congressional report said.   Gregg testified that he was told about certain elements of theresupply operation by former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez in August1986. But Gregg said he never passed along his information to Bushbecause he ``did not consider these facts worthy of the vicepresident's attention.''</TEXT></DOC>
