Others that involve the lung of the child may in fact be encounteredin the adult as well, e.g., cystic adenomatoid malformation, knowledgeof which will provide another basis for a more encompassing differentialdiagnosis of some curious or poorly understood problems. Some would appearto be quite rare, and one might wonder why they should be included, e.g.,plastic bronchitis and immotile cilia syndrome. The radiologist is theone who may well see the patient with chronic pulmonary disease on repeatedoccasions and suggest an approximate differential diagnosis that mayresult in a definitive diagnosis. One must know the possibilities, however,in order to construct such a differential. There are papers dealing withhydatid disease and amebiasis, uncommon to be sure, but these diseaseshave been encountered in Boston an I am sure elsewhere as the world getssmaller and travel becomes available to more people. Again, it is theradiologist who might be the first to suspect the underlying disease.There is a follow-up to an interesting article that occurred in the 1984YEAR BOOK (article 6-1) that has to do with the role of surgical interventionin utero. The abstracted paper concerned with the prenatal diagnosisof obstructive uropathy and the comments by Doctor Lebowitz that areincluded this year are pertinent as intrauterine diagnosis and potentialtherapy become better understood and defined. The dysfunction of collagen-dificientosteogenesis imperfecta is of interest because of its importance andrelevance to the diagnosis of the osseous dysplasias; its elucidationwill become more and more the province of the enzyme chemist or the biochemistas opposed to reliance on gross morphology.</TEXT></DOC>
