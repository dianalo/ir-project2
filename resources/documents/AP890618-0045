Gorbachev, the Tass news agency said Sunday.   Tass did not say how long Rafsanjani would stay in Moscow or withwhom he would met.   Iran's state-run television said a 35-member Iranian delegationhad gone to Moscow to prepare for the visit, which begins Tuesday.   It quoted the delegation's leader, Economy and Finance MinisterMohammad Javad Iravani, as saying a long-term industrial andeconomic cooperation agreement will be signed with the Soviet Unionduring the visit.   Tentative plans for the visit were set in March when Gorbachevmet in Moscow with Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, Tasssaid.   Rafsanjani has said he will press for improved relations betweenthe two countries, reportedly the dying wish of Iran's spiritualleader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Iranian leader died June 3after suffering a heart attack.   The importance of the visit was underscored by the fact that itwas not postponed even though Iran is in the midst of 40 days ofofficial mourning for Khomeini.   Rafsanjani, who is acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armedforces as well as Parliament speaker, is regarded as the shrewdestand most powerful politician in Iran. He is the only candidate inthe Aug. 18 presidential election.   The Parliament speaker has favored expanding foreign ties to endIran's isolation.   Khomeini indicated the importance he attached to ties with theKremlin by receiving Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadzein Tehran. Last year, Khomeini sent a message to Gorbachev urginghim to study Islam.   Iran's relations with the Soviet Union have improved since theAug. 20 U.N.-mediated cease-fire in Tehran's eight-year war withIraq. Moscow was Iraq's largest arms supplier during the war.   Now Iran needs Soviet help to rebuild its war-shattered economy.   In December, Moscow agreed to help restore the giant Isfahansteel complex, which the Soviets built in the 1970s. The complex waspractically destroyed during the war.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Saturday that Iranwill begin exports of natural gas to the Soviet Union. He also saidthat Iranian gas would be exported to Bulgaria through the SovietUnion.</TEXT></DOC>
