It is BNL's intention to use these power suppliesto energize the LESB III separators and to eventually purchase severaladditional units from their manufacturer, Nichicon Capacitor Company.It is believed that Nichicon is the only source of power supplies ofthis type. The operational aspects of the KEK main magnet power supplywas also investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
