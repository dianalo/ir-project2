White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said Mexican and banknegotiators were ``very close'' on terms for an agreement. The loanis contingent on an accord between the country and its creditors toreduce and rearrange $54 billion in existing loans.   However, some outstanding issues remain and no deal is in sight,Sununu said.   ``The quality of the solution is more important than thetimetable,'' the White House official told reporters a few hoursbefore the opening of the economic summit here.   According to Sununu, Mexican officials want to ``get it donecorrectly rather than trying to rush it.''   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the UnitedStates sought to sweeten such a deal between Mexico and the banks byproviding a so-called bridge loan.   ``We are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order tocomplete the agreement ...,'' Sununu said in confirming the report.   President Bush met this morning with with Mexican PresidentCarlos Salinas de Gortari. The two are attending the 200thanniversary celebration of the French Revolution.   Such loans are sometimes used to assist a country hampered bypaperwork delays following debtor loan negotiations with foreignbank creditors. More than half of Mexico's total foreign debt isowed to commercial banks, many of them in the United States.   The Mexican government has said it would want to reach such anagreement before accepting new loans. The United States hasindicated it would like to wrap up an accord as soon as possible, asign to the other summit nations that it has adopted a new approachon the debt.   Sununu stressed that ``there is no requirement to leave thesummit ... with an agreement'' and that an artificial deadline mighthurt the quality of the final agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
