Rebuilding Chobielin will be mylabor of love, my contribution to rebuilding Poland and mypersonal battle against the remnants of communism. It'll alsobe a spiritual experience. I want to purify these few acresof Poland from the filth of communist rule. God willing, in afew years' time my guests will be able to enjoy a heartylunch, take a stroll along the river, look around and thinkthat communism somehow spared this remote place. That'll bemy greatest pleasure and reward. On this patch of land itwill seem as if communism had never existed.</TEXT></DOC>
