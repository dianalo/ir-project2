The editors atthe Los Angeles Times must have felt the same way becausethey buried the story in a small paragraph in the middle ofthe paper's first section. No photographs. No headlines.   In the week that followed, this story began to resemble apebble in a shoe: Despite its insignificance, it just wouldnot go away. And, like the pebble, it ultimately captured myattention. Over these past weeks, I have developed anenormous sympathy for Mr. Reubens. Of all the players in thistragicomedy of adult hypocrisy, &quot;Pee-wee Herman&quot; has emergedas the most &quot;grown-up.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Our society has been through the public &quot;exposing&quot; oftelevangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart. We have enduredscandals that uncovered the seamier sides of politicians fromWayne Hays and Wilbur Mills to Gary Hart and Ted Kennedy. Insharp contrast to such experienced public &quot;adult&quot; rolemodels, Mr. Reubens had the good sense and personal dignityto issue a simple statement and to get out of sight for awhile. He is apparently in seclusion with friends.   All we really know is that he is alleged to have broken apublic-morals law in Florida. At the time of his arrest, hewas sporting long hair and a goatee, acting as a privateperson in a private capacity. He was arrested at the kind ofplace that our civil libertarians often define as a &quot;FirstAmendment institution.&quot;   Because Mr. Reubens has chosen to abandon the spotlightfor now, the public vacuum has been filled by a strangeassortment of pop moralists and critics. In a plot twistworthy of any made-for-TV movie, Mr. Reubens has beenhatcheted primarily by the free-speech civil libertarians ofthe entertainment industry.   CBS has canceled Emmy-quality &quot;Peewee's Playhouse&quot; rerunsthat it had planned to air throughout August. Disney hasexcised a two-minute Pee-wee film that was on display at itsDisney-MGM Studios in Florida. The Philadelphia Zoo haszapped another two-minute Pee-wee flick, this one explainingmetamorphosis and starring a butterfly and a caterpillar.   Gary Lombardi, an Orlando, Fla., car technician, will nolonger be making money at children's birthday parties bydoing his Pee-wee imitation. Stephen Azzato, a packagingdesigner for Abbott Laboratories in Illinois, has alsoretired from the Pee-wee Herman/kiddie-birthday circuit. Intheir concern for ethics and the law, they did not indicateto their respective newspaper interviewers whether they hadpreviously been paying royalties to Mr. Reubens for the rightto professionally impersonate his character.   Pop-psychologist Barbara De Angelis told TV viewers that&quot;a guy who's playing a child his whole life has to have somekind of problems.&quot; Robert Klein went on David Letterman'slate-night talk show and would not let go of the incident,squeezing from it whatever sick humor he could find.Ultimately, he embarrassed himself.   Everyone has suddenly become very concerned about helpingparents of young children, parents like me, &quot;cope&quot; with theincident. From TV newscasts to radio call-in shows tofront-page news columns, psychologists have been peddlingtheir wares, advising me what to tell my children. Strange.   For me, as a parent of young children, I am far moreconcerned about the lyrics of contemporary music. I amconcerned about Andrew Dice Clay being legitimized on networktelevision and in the movies. I am concerned about Axl Roseinspiring young people. I am concerned that our society hastransformed a woman like Madonna into a public institution, abona fide role model for the children of the MTV generation.The Disney folks' Touchstone division helped legitimizeMadonna when they placed their imprimatur on her &quot;BreathlessMahoney&quot; character in Warren Beatty's &quot;Dick Tracy.&quot;   When I was a kid, my parents could take me to lots ofmovies, and our family could watch network sitcoms together.I was simply forbidden to watch the &quot;bizarre things&quot; thatappeared on the early versions of cable TV. But now, as acontemporary parent, I can't even take my kids to most &quot;kids'movies.&quot; (Remember the electric masturbation device in&quot;Parenthood&quot;? The ubiquitous sexuality in &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;?) Asfor TV, the only thing I'll let my kids watch today is cable,where they can view &quot;Beverly Hillbillies,&quot; &quot;Green Acres,&quot;&quot;Mister Ed,&quot; &quot;Andy Griffith&quot; and &quot;Perry Mason.&quot;   In fact, despite Mr. Reubens's personal tragedy, I wouldstill -- even now -- rather rent a Pee-wee Herman video thanhave my kids watch &quot;Geraldo]&quot; weekday afternoons on CBS.   Mr. Reubens has not been tried. Despite the vaunted&quot;public's right to know,&quot; we could have all survived justfine without his personal -- and very private -- tragedybeing emblazoned in every newspaper in the country. He wasnot accused of rape, incest or child molestation. He wasaccused of privately misbehaving at a place that Floridalicenses for X-rated &quot;entertainment.&quot; Our state licenses suchplaces, too. One such huge place greets visitors to our faircity five minutes from LAX. CBS makes its weekday-afternoonmillions by exploiting the public's same X-rated prurientinstincts.   In the whole mess of hypocrisy and public tittering, Ithink that Paul Reubens has emerged as the best of the bunch.Unlike the televangelists and politicians, he told the truthand admitted that he was in a bad place. Unlike the mediamoguls, &quot;experts&quot; and comedians, he knew when to keep hismouth shut. And, instead of turning for sympathy to a fickleand hypocritical public, he sequestered himself with closefriends and family. No Pee-wee he.   ---   Mr. Aharoni, a rabbi and author, is a student at the UCLASchool of Law.</TEXT></DOC>
