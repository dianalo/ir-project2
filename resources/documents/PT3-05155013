No. 07/409,075 filed      Sep. 19, 1989, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a light-sensitive silver halide      photographic material. More particularly, it relates to a light-sensitive      silver halide photographic material having at least one silver halide      emulsion layer on one side of a support and a backing layer on the other      side thereof. </PAR><PAR>  In the present specification, the &quot;backing layer&quot; refers to a      non-light-sensitive silver halide colloid layer formed on the side      opposite to the side on which a silver halide emulsion layer is provided. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Light-sensitive materials having a silver halide emulsion layer on one side      of a support and a backing layer on the other side thereof (hereinafter      often &quot;one-side light-sensitive material&quot;), which have the composition not      identical on each side, tend to cause curvature in the light-sensitive      material. There are some disadvantages accompanying the curvature, and      what is important, for example, is that it tends to cause carrying      troubles when a light-sensitive material is carried with an automatic      carrying device. </PAR><PAR>  It also often occurs that the degree of curvature (hereinafter often      referred to as &quot;the degree of curl&quot;) varies depending on conditions. For      example, changes in temperature or humidity cause the curvature in various      ways because of the difference in the layer constitution on both sides of      the one-side light-sensitive material, thus resulting in variation of the      degree of curl. The variation of the degree of curl makes it more      difficult to take a coutermeasure to the curvature. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, light-sensitive silver halide photographic materials      should preferably be feasible for rapid processing. Since, however, the      one-side light-sensitive material is comprised of a light-sentive emulsion      layer formed only on its one side, the amount of silver (or silver weight)      on one side must be made larger in many instances when compared with the      case when silver halide emulsion layers are formed on both sides. In such      instances, it follows that the amount of hydrophilic colloids in the      emulsion layer must also be made larger, resulting in a poorness in drying      properties when processing is carried out. This brings about a      disadvantage in carrying out the rapid processing. </PAR><PAR>  For improving the drying properties, it is preferred to make smaller the      amount of hydrophilic colloids in regard to the silver halide emulsion      layer and also increase the degree of hardening to lower the water      absorption properties of the emulsion layer. Taking only such measures,      however, may cause a deterioration of photographic performance, for      example, an increase in fog, a lowering of graininess, or a poorness in      scratch resistance. </PAR><PAR>  As previously mentioned, it is also desirable for the light-sensitive      material to have a small variation in the degree of curl against changes      in temperature and humidity. For this purpose, what is important is the      balance of layer thickness between the backing layer and emulsion layer,      and it may be commonly attempted to make large the thickness of the      backing layer to take the balance. A large thickness of the backing layer,      too, results in an increase in water-absorption to cause defective drying.      This consequently goes against the demand for rapid processing. </PAR><PAR>  As mentioned in the above, there are a demand for the prevention of      curvature (and variation of the degree of curl) and a demand for rapid      processing with regard to the one-side light-sensitive material. It,      however, is difficult to satisfy the both. </PAR><PAR>  As pointed out in the above, the one-side light-sensitive material has a      large silver weight on one side of a support, and in some instances the      one side is coated with a silver halide emulsion in such a large silver      weight that corresponds to the total silver weight on both sides of a      both-side light-sensitive material. Such a large weight of silver present      on the one side may make it impossible to sufficiently carry out fixing      when the processing is made under rapid processing, resulting in a large      quantity of remaining silver salts. As a result, the storage stability may      be worsened, often causing a deterioration of the image quality during the      storage of images obtained by the processing. </PAR><PAR>  This problem can be solved by making small the silver weight on the      emulsion layer side. Making small the silver weight on the emulsion layer      side, however, may often cause other problems. </PAR><PAR>  As an important problem, there is the problem that the decrease in the      silver weight makes it difficult to detect a light-sensitive material. </PAR><PAR>  For example, in CRT photography in which an infrared sensor detects a      light-sensitive material used for photography, the sensor can not achieve      the detection it the silver weight is small, so that all the operations      after the detection, for example, carriage of the light-sensitive      material, can not be performed. </PAR><PAR>  Of course, the silver weight may be increased to solve such a problem in      the detection, but this may cause difficulties such as defective fixing,      which go against the fundamental demand of achieving rapid processing. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to solve the above problems involved      in the prior art and provide a one-side light-sensitive material causing a      small curvature, having a small variation of the degree of curl even when      the curvature has been caused, and yet have a good adaptability to rapid      processing, having a superior photographic performance such as sensitivity      even when the rapid processing is carried out. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a one-side      light-sensitive silver halide photographic material suited for rapid      processing, and achieving a good detecting performance and carrying      performance even when the light-sensitive material is embodied, for      example, as a light-sensitive material used for CRT photography in which a      sensor detects the light-sensitive material. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve the above objects, the light-sensitive silver halide      photographic material of the present invention comprises a support having      on one side thereof a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and on      the other side thereof a backing layer, wherein T.sub.E /T.sub.B, the      ratio of the total dry layer thickness T.sub.E on the side having said      silver halide emulsion layer to the total dry layer thickness T.sub.B of      the side having said backing layer, is not less than 0.8 and not more than      1.5, the water absorption on the side having said silver halide emulsion      layer is not more than 8.5 g/m.sup.2, and the water absorption on the side      having said silver halide emulsion layer is smaller than the water      absorption on the side having said backing layer. </PAR><PAR>  Layers such as an anti-halation layer and a protective layer may be      optionally provided on each side of the side having the silver halide      emulsion layer and the side having the backing layer. </PAR><PAR>  The light sensitive material of the present invention is preferably used      when the rapid processing is carried out. In a preferred embodiment, the      rapid processing is carried out under conditions corresponding to the      following equation. </PAR><EQU>  l.sup.0.75 .times.Tandequals;50 to 124, </EQU><EQU>  0.7andlt;l 4.0 </EQU><PAL>  wherein l represents a processing length (unit: m) at the time the      light-sensitive silver halide photographic material is processed, and T      represents a time (unit: second) required for said light-sensitive      material to pass on said l. </PAL><PAR>  The light-sensitive material of the present invention may preferably have a      backing layer containing non-light-sensitive silver halide grains. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In the light-sensitive material of the present invention, T.sub.E /T.sub.B,      the ratio of the total dry layer thickness T.sub.E on the side having said      silver halide emulsion layer to the total dry layer thickness T.sub.B of      the side having said backing layer, is not less than 0.8 and not more than      1.5. </PAR><PAR>  The layer thickness mentioned in the present invention refers to the dry      layer thickness of photographic component layers on each side. It refers      not to the thickness at the part locally protruded because of a matting      agent or the like, but to an average thickness. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, it is theoretically a vaIue obtained by dividing the      weight X.sub.1 g/cm.sup.2 to X.sub.n g/cm.sup.2, which is the weight of      each additive contained per 1 cm.sup.2 of a photographic component layer,      by the density D.sub.1 g/cm.sup.3 to D.sub.n g/cm.sup.3, of the substance.      Thus the film thickness held by the additive can be calculated. Hence, the      total layer thickness can be determined by the following equation.      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  When actually measured, it can be known by fault observation using a      microscope or measurement using a micrometer. </PAR><PAR>  In the light-sensitive material of the present invention, the both layer      thicknesses T.sub.E and T.sub.B satisfy the above conditions. </PAR><PAR>  The above T.sub.E /T.sub.B may preferably be not less than 1.1 and not more      than 1.3. </PAR><PAR>  In the light-sensitive silver halide photographic material of the present      invention, the water absorption on the side having the silver halide      emulsion layer is not more than 8.5 g/m.sup.2. In addition, the water      absorption on the side having the backing layer is smaller than the water      absorption on the side having the silver halide emulsion layer. </PAR><PAR>  The water absorption on the side having the emulsion layer may preferably      range from 5.8 to 8.2 g/m.sup.2. The water absorption on the side having      the backing layer may also preferably range from 4.0 to 7.5 g/m.sup.2. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the water absorption as the whole light-sensitive      material may preferably be not more than 15 g/m.sup.2. It may more      preferably be not more than 13.5 g/m.sup.2. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the water absorption is indicated by a difference      between the weight under water-absorbed conditions and dry weight. This is      a value obtained under the following conditions. </PAR><PAR>  Namely, the light-sensitive material is subjected to developing; </PAR><PAR>  at a temperature ranging from 20.degree. C. to 26.degree.

This      light-sensitive material is further dried for 5 hours under conditions of      a temperature of from 23.degree. C. and a relative humidity of 55% and      then the dry weight is measured. The difference in this wet weight and dry      weight corresponds to the water absorption. To describe specifically, it      is obtained by the following procedures: </PAL><PAR>  A quarter film of MG-SR film (available from Konica Corporation) is      continuously processed in the number of 100 sheets at intervals of one      sheet in 7 seconds in a lightroom (the minor side of the film is faced in      the direction of the progress of processing). Samples to be measured are      also similarly processed under the same size and the same concentration at      the same intervals, and the wet weight is measured immediately after they      come out of a squeesee rack. The same samples are dried in the same way as      the above to determine the difference between the dry weight and wet      weight, and the difference is expressed in terms of an water absorption      per 1 m.sup.2. This is the water absorption according to the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  The water absorption each on the side having the emulsion layer      (hereinafter &quot;emulsion side&quot; for convenience) and on the side having the      backing layer (hereinafter &quot;backing side&quot; for convenience) can be      determined by the following formula. </PAR><PAR>  Namely, in respect of each sample, three kinds of samples from which only      the emulsion side, only the backing side, or both sides has or have been      dissolved and removed using a proteolytic enzyme solution were prepared,      and the water absorption is measured on each. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, assuming the water absorption of the sample having both the      emulsion side and backing side as H.sub.W ; </PAR><PAR>  the water absorption of the sample in which only the emulsion side remains,      as H.sub.E ; </PAR><PAR>  the water absorption of the sample in which only the backing side remains,      as H.sub.B ; </PAR><PAR>  the water absorption of the sample in which only the support remains, as      B.sub.W ; and </PAR><PAR>  the weight of the support B.sub.O ; </PAR><PAR>  the water absorption of the emulsion side is determined from: </PAR><EQU>  H.sub.W -H.sub.B -1/2(B.sub.W -B.sub.O) </EQU><PAL>  and the water absorption of the backing side, from: </PAL><EQU>  H.sub.W -H.sub.E -1/2(B.sub.W -B.sub.O). </EQU><PAR>  To control the water absorption of each surface within the range of the      present invention, various technical means can be used. For example, the      desired water absorption can be obtained by adjusting the degree of      hardening of the layer on each side. For another example, the water      absorption of the backing side can be made smaller than that of the      emulsion side by making the degree of hardening of the backing side larger      than the degree of hardening of the emulsion side. </PAR><PAR>  The light-sensitive material of the present invention may preferably have a      silver weight of not more than 3.5 g/m.sup.2. This is because the      adaptability to rapid processing can be further enhanced. </PAR><PAR>  The silver halide emulsion layer used in the light-sensitive material of      the present invention may preferably be spectrally sensitized. For      example, orthochromatic sensitization, panchromatic sensitization, and      infrared spectral sensitization can be carried out. </PAR><PAR>  It is also a preferred example that the present invention is applied as a      light-sensitive material used for a laser printer, using an infrared      spectral sensitizing dye as disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I.      Publication No. 192242/1984, represented by Formula (I) or (II) or an      infrared spectral sensitizing dye as disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I.      Publication No. 56652/1988, pages 325-326. </PAR><PAR>  Silver halides used may be appropriately selected from those used in usual      silver halide emulsions, such as silver bromide, silver iodobromide,      silver chlorobromide and silver chloride, depending on the purpose for      which the light-sensitive material is used. Silver iodobromide may      preferably be used. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the non-light-sensitive silver halide grains      contained in the backing layer may preferably be non-light-sensitive, but      may be satisfactory if it is substantially non-light-sensitive. Herein,      the &quot;substantially non-light-sensitive&quot; is meant to be light-sensitive to      the extent no blackening may be caused as a result of developing even when      the silver halides have been exposed to light. </PAR><PAR>  There are no particular limitations on the halogen composition of such      non-light-sensitive silver halide grains. For example, there can be used      any of silver bromide, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide, and so      forth. Silver bromide or silver iodobromide may preferably be used. When      silver iodobromide is used, particularly preferred is the one containing      not less than 1.5 mol % of iodine. These silver halide grains may      preferably be not subjected to chemical ripening. </PAR><PAR>  The non-light-sensitive silver halide grains used in the present invention      may preferably have a grain size of not less than 0.3 .mu.m when an      additional effect of reflection or scattering of light is expected. The      size may preferably be not more than 1.9 .mu.m from the viewpoint of the      influence on photographic performance. It may particularly preferably be      within the range of from 0.5 to 1.7 .mu.m. In the present invention,      however, the grain size of the non-light-sensitive silver halide grains is      not necessarily an important subject. </PAR><PAR>  In the meantime, the grain size is meant to be a diameter of a grain when      the grain is spherical, and, when it is not spherical, a diameter obtained      by calculating its projection image as a circle having the corresponding      area. </PAR><PAR>  The non-light-sensitive silver halide may preferably be contained in the      backing layer in an amount ranging from 3.0 to 20 mg/dm.sup.2, and more      preferably from 4.0 to 10 mg/dm.sup.2. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the non-light-sensitive silver halide is      contained in the backing layer. It may be contained in any layers in      instances in which the backing layer is comprised of two or more layers.      It may also be included separately in each layer. </PAR><PAR>  The backing layer may optionally contain a water-soluble dye or the like. </PAR><PAR>  A preferred embodiment according to which the light-sensitive material of      the present invention is processed will be described below. </PAR><PAR>  The processing length l determined when the light-sensitive material of the      present invention is processed may preferably be in the range of more than      0.7 and less than 3.1 (unit: m). A length l not more than 0.7 makes each      processing step excessively short, often resulting in a lowering of      sensitivity, and also makes small the number of rollers used, often      resulting in a poor carrying performance, when applied in an apparatus in      which light-sensitive materials are carried using a roller system. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, a length l not less than 3.1 may make the carrying speed      excessively high, often tending to make scratches on films. </PAR><PAR>  The product of l.sup. 0.75 and T may preferably be not less than 50 and not      more than 124. A value less than 50 may often result in a lowering of the      sensitivity of the light-sensitive material, or may bring color remaining      into question. The product of l.sup.0.75 and T may more preferably be not      less than 76. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, a value more than 124, of the product of l.sup.0.75 and      T may often cause a deterioration of the graininess of photographic images      although the sentivity is little increased, and also bring about an      increase in fog. </PAR><PAR>  According to the processing conditions described above, it is possible to      obtain the good results that the graininess is good irrespective of high      sensitivity and yet defective fixing, defective washing or defective      drying may occur with difficulty. </PAR><PAR>  In instances in which the processing is carried out using an automatic      processor, it is preferred to use an automatic processor of a roller      carriage type. In such instances, the number of all carrying rollers may      preferably be such that a value obtained by dividing the processing length      l by the number of rollers is in the range of from 0.01 to 0.04. The time      required for each processing section may preferably be in the following      range. </PAR><TBL>  ______________________________________                                         Insertion andplus; developing andplus; carrying:                                                                     25 to 40%                                              Fixing andplus; carrying       12 to 25%                                              Washing andplus; carrying      10 to 25%                                              Squeegeeing andplus; drying    25 to 45%                                              Total                   100%                                                   ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  Rollers used may preferably range between 12 mm and 60 mm in diameter at      the carrying section, and between 30 cm and 110 cm in length.

At the      carrying sections or sqeeseeing section, preferably used are silicone      rubbers having water repellency and resiliency, or synthetic leathers as      exemplified by &quot;Kurarino&quot; (trade name; available from Kuraray). </PAR><PAR>  Processing solutions such as a developing solution and a fixing solution      used in the processing may be selected from appropriate ones depending on      the light-sensitive material. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will be described below by giving Examples. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  An emulsion containing flat-plate silver iodobromide grains having an      average grain diameter of 1.71 .mu.m and an aspect ratio of about 16:1 was      prepared according to the method used in preparing Emulsion 3 (Example)      disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection      (hereinafter &quot;Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication&quot;) No. 113927/1983. The      present grains comprises silver iodobromide grains holding 80% or more of      the total projected areas. In the present grains, however, spectral      sensitizing dyes A and B were added before desalting, in a weight ratio of      200:1 and in an amount of 1,000 mg in total per mol of silver halide. </PAR><PAR>  In adding the spectral sensitizing dyes, the pH was adjusted to pH 7.60,      phenylcarbamylated gelatin was added after 15 minutes, the pH was lowered      using acetic acid, followed by agglomeration, and then the supernatant was      removed. </PAR><PAR>  To the grains thus obtained, deionized water was added so as to give a      volume of 500 ml per 1 mole of the silver halide grains. The resulting      mixture was heated to 52.degree. C., and then the spectral sensitizing      dyes A and B were added therein in a weight ratio of 200:1 and in an      amount of 100 mg in total per mol of silver halide. After 10 minutes, 0.6      g of a styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer was added therein. After 2      minutes, ammonium thiocyanate in an amount of 2.6.times.10.sup.-3 mol per      mol of silver, and chloroauric acid and sodium thiosulfate in appropriate      amounts were further added. Chemical ripening was thus initiated. This      chemical ripening was carried out under conditions of pH 6.02 and silver      potential of 49 mV. </PAR><PAR>  Fifteen (15) minutes before completion of the chemical ripening (80 minutes      after initiation of the chemical ripening), potassium iodide was added in      an amount of 300 mg per mol of silver, 10% (w/v) acetic acid was added      after 5 minutes, the pH value was lowered to 5.6, and the resulting pH was      maintained for 5 minutes. Thereafter, a 0.5% (w/v) potassium hydroxide      solution was added, the pH was adjusted to 6.15, and thereafter      4-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,3,3a,7-tetrazaindene and lime-treated osein gelatin      were added in an amount of 4.times.10.sup.-2 mol and so as to give the      coating weight as described later, respectively. The chemical ripening was      thus completed to prepare a photographic emulsion coating solution. </PAR><PAR>  After the preparation of the photographic emulsion coating solution, the pH      was 6.30, and the silver potential, 85 mV (35.degree. C.). </PAR><PAR>  The photographic emulsion coating solution thus prepared was applied on the      surface of one side of a support to provide a photographic emulsion layer.      As the support, here was used a polyethylene terephthalate film of 175      .mu.m thick. </PAR><PAR>  The photographic emulsion layer was provided by coating so as to give a      coating weight of 3.2 g/m.sup.2 in terms of silver, per one side of the      support, and a gelatin weight of 2.2 g/m.sup.2. Using the protective layer      solution as described later, a protective layer was also formed on the      emulsion layer. This protective layer was provided by coating so as to      give a coating weight of 1.1 g/m.sup.2 of gelatin. A backing layer is      provided on the surface opposite to the side having the emulsion layer.      This, however, is formed to be comprised of a lower backing layer and an      upper backing layer. More specifically, the backing layer as described      below was provided in the manner that the lower backing layer and upper      backing layer were provided by simultaneous coating on both sides of a      polyethylene terephthalate base so as to give gelatin coating weights of      3.0 g/m.sup.2 and 1.2 g/m.sup.2, respectively, using two sets of slide      hopper coaters at a speed of 80 m/min, followed by drying in 2 minutes 20      seconds. Samples were thus obtained. </PAR><PAR>  The sample thus obtained was inserted to a fluorescent intensifying screen      KO-250 (available from Konica Corporation), which was then irradiated with      X-rays at a tube voltage of 130 KVP at 20 mA for 0.05 second to effect      exposure through a penetrometer Type B (aluminum steps; available from      Konica Medical Corporation). Thereafter, processing was carried out in 45      seconds with Konica Automatic Processor SRX-501, using processing      solutions (a developing solution and a fixing solution). </PAR><PAR>  Samples 1 to 9 all had a layer thickness T.sub.E of 3.45 .mu.m, on the side      having the emulsion layer, and a layer thickness T.sub.B of 3.2 .mu.m, on      the side having the backing layer, the ratio of the both, T.sub.E      /T.sub.B, being 1.078. </PAR><PAR>  The following are the spectral sensitizing dyes used in preparing the      samples.      ##STR1## </PAR><PAR>  The following are the additives used in the silver halide photographic      emulsion coating solution.

The samples      according to the present invention showed less curl and less change with      good results. </PAR><PAR>  All the samples 1 to 9 had a melting point to water, of not less than      94.degree.

On the other hand, in respect of the samples Nos. 3, 2,      6, 1 and 5 having a water absorption of not more than 8.5, there was a      tendency that the graininess became substantially uniform in a good state. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  Using the same emulsion solution, protective layer solution and backing      layer solution as those in Example 1, Example 1 was repeated to prepare      Samples 10 to 22 having different water absorption, except that the dry      coating layer thickness of the emulsion side and that of the backing side      were adjusted by changing the amount of the emulsion coating solution and      lower backing layer solution and the amount of the hardening agent, and      also the degree of hardening was changed by adjusting the amount of the      hardening agent solution used in Example 1. Similar evaluation was made.      Results obtained are shown in Table 2. Evaluation on the variation of the      degree of curl was made in the following manner. </PAR><PAC>  Measurement of the Degree of Curl </PAC><PAR>  The relative humidity was changed from 20% to 80% at a temperature of      23.degree.

C., pAgandequals;8.0 and pHandequals;2.0, a monodisperse      cubic emulsion of silver iodobromide grains having an average grain size      of 0.25 .mu.m and containing 2.0 mol % of silver iodide was obtained      according to a double jet method. A part of the grains of this emulsion      was used as cores to effect growth as follows: In a solution containing      core grains and gelatin, an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and a      solution containing potassium bromide and potassium iodide were added at      40.degree. C., pAgandequals;8.0 and pHandequals;9.5 according to the double jet method, to      form first shells containing 40 mol % of silver iodide. </PAR><PAR>  The rate of addition was gradually accelerated with the growth of grains. </PAR><PAR>  The resulting emulsion was an monodisperse octahedral emulsion having an      average grain size of 0.27 .mu.m. The grains of this emulsion were used as      cores, and an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and a potassium bromide      solution were added at pAgandequals;11.0 and pHandequals;9.0 according to the double jet      method, to form second shells. A monodisperse emulsion having an average      grain size of 0.41 .mu.m was thus obtained. The emulsion obtained had an      average silver iodide content of 2.0 mol %. </PAR><PAR>  In the above emulsion, the following sensitizing dyes (a) and (b) were      added, and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. Thereafter,      3.4.times.10.sup.-3 mol of thiocyanate, per mol of silver, and appropriate      amounts of chloroauric acid and sodium thiosulfate were added to carry out      chemical ripening, and 1.3.times.10.sup.-3 mol of potassium iodide, per      mol of silver, was subsequently added to effect ripening for 15 minutes.      Additives were further used to give the composition as described later to      prepare a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion coating solution.      ##STR17## </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, as a coating solution for the backing layer formed on      the side opposite to the side coated with the light-sensitive silver      halide emulsion coating solution, a coating solution was prepared with the      composition described below. </PAR><PAR>  Non-light-sensitive silver halide grains are also incorporated in the      backing layer. For this purpose, the grains having the grain size as shown      in Table 3 were incorporated in the backing layer coating solution used in      each sample, so as to be in the amount as shown in Table 3.

A CRT camera used      here has an infrared light-emitting device and light-receiving device      provided in pair, and has such a mechanism that a film carried on      sufficiently intercepts infrared rays when it passes between the devices      so that &quot;film present&quot; can be detected. </PAR><PAR>  Results obtained are shown in Table 3. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 3                                                          ______________________________________                                         Coating                                                                        weight of  Non-light-sensitive                                                 light-     silver halide                                                       sensitive  grains contained                                                    silver     in backing layer                                                                             Carrying-                                             Sam- halide    Grain   Coating in-camera                                       ple  emulsion  size    weight  performance                                     No.  (mg/dm.sup.2)                                                                            (.mu.m) (mg/dm.sup.2)                                                                          a/10*    T.sub.E /T.sub.B                       ______________________________________                                          1   33        --      --       0/10    0.93                                    2   33        2.1      6       3/10    0.91                                    3   33        1.7      6      10/10    0.91                                    4   33        1.0      6      10/10    0.91                                    5   33        0.6      4      10/10    0.91                                    6   33        0.6      6      10/10    0.91                                    7   33        0.6      8      10/10    0.90                                    8   33        0.6     10      10/10    0.89                                    9   33        0.4      6      10/10    0.91                                   10   33        0.2      6       1/10    0.91                                   11   33        0.1      6       0/10    0.91                                   ______________________________________                                          *a/10 represents the number of sheets of film which were able to be            detected and carried without any problem when the 10 sheet continuous          carrying tests were made.                                                 </TBL><PAR>  Table 3 shows that films, used in a CRT camera, are detected and can be      carried when the non-light-sensitive silver halide grains are incorporated      in the backing layer of the light-sensitive material of the present      invention, with appropriately selected grain size and content. </PAR><PAR>  Tests were also made on a sample obtained by not adding to the backing      layer the non-light-sensitive silver halide grains added to the backing      layer of the sample No. 6 in Table 3, but mixing them with the      light-sensitive silver halide used in the emulsion layer followed by      coating, and a sample obtained by using the light-sensitive silver halide      grains in an amount increased to the same amount as the      non-light-sensitive silver halide grains followed by coating. As a result,      the films were detected without any problem, but it was found that silver      remained in a large weight under the rapid processing as in the present      Example, bringing about a problem in maintaining image quality. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
