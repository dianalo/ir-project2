But British Foreign Secretary John Major said the organizationrecognized for the first time sanctions should not be punitive andshould be scaled down if the white-led government delivers onpromises of reform.   ``We do not wish to hand a broken-backed economy over to a newSouth Africa in due course,'' Major said in an interview with theBritish Broadcasting Corp.   In a separate development, the Commonwealth summit issued adeclaration on the environment which, in a victory for thedeveloped nations, failed to give outright support to an Indiandemand to set up a new environmental fund.   Commonwealth leaders debated the South Africa draft today duringa weekend retreat at Langkawi, a luxury resort island 210 milesnorthwest of the capital, midway through the weeklong summit.Malayasian officials said the final communique will be issuedSunday.   Major rejected both the call to tighten financial screws onSouth Africa and to reappoint a foreign ministers' committeedrawing up the communique on financial sanctions.   ``We think they're both wrong-headed,'' he said.   The draft was drawn up after the 10-nation foreign ministers'committee _ including Britain _ argued into the early hours.   Diplomatic sources said the draft incorporated the essence of afive-point Australian plan which stipulates that the Commonwealthwill try to squeeze South Africa's foreign loans and trade credits.   While the dispute remained, the outcome appeared to reflect thefirst signs of concensus on a policy toward South Africa by the49-nation association of Britain and its former colonies.   The draft, the sources said, stipulates that a reappointedcommittee of eight foreign ministers, which has monitored sanctionsfor the past two years, will meet next April to examine how farF.W. de Klerk, South Africa's new president who took office inAugust, has moved toward reform.   South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961.   The commmittee, expanded to nine with summit host Malayasia, ischaired by Canada and also includes four of the most deeply hostilecritics of South Africa, the black African nations of Zimbabwe,Zambia, Nigeria and Tanzania. The 10-point declaration on theenvironment, approved Saturday morning by the Commonwealth leaderscalled for additional support for ``the development ofinternational funding mechanisms'' to preserve the enviroment.   And it said these should ``take account'' of India's proposalfor a new ``Planet Protection Fund,'' stopping well short ofendorsing the proposal.   Developed countries, led by Britain's Prime Minister MargaretThatcher, argued a new fund would be an unnecessary duplication andthat all aid should be channelled through the U.N. EnvironmentalProtection Program.   The Commonwealth in 1986 adopted 11 non-binding sanctions,including bans on air links, new investment, and imports ofagricultural products, iron, steel, coal and uranium. Britain, thelargest foreign investor in South Africa, strongly resisted theidea of a list but eventually applied a handful of measures.</TEXT></DOC>
