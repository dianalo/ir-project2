This actionconstitutes a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectivenessof these regulations under those procedures. The new sunset review dateestablished for these regulations is August 1, 1993. John Marshall, Manager, FCIC, (1) has determined that this action is nota major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291 because it will not resultin: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) majorincreases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,State, or local governments, or a geographical region; or (c) significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets; and (2) certifies that thisaction will not increase the federal paperwork burden for individuals,small businesses, and other persons and will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This action is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct; therefore, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared. <ITAG tagnum="21">This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.450.</ITAG>This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115, June 24, 1983.This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an EnvironmentalAssessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. FCIC hereby revises and reissues the Quality Potato Option (7 CFR 422.9)with the following changes:1. The Option has been made continuous. The insured no longer has to submita new application for each crop year. All language regarding annual submissionof the form has been removed. 2. Language has been added to indicate that if both this Option and thefrost/freeze Option are in effect that only the Option which results inthe least production to count will be considered. This language is necessaryto prevent the possibility of a separate indemnity for each Option. 3. The definition of ``acceptable inspection'' and language designatingwho may make grade determinations has been added. These additions are inresponse to an Office of Inspector General_Audit (OIG) comment which requestedthat any grade determination should be made by someone with proper training.4. Additional minor editorial changes have been made to improve clarity.These changes do not affect the meaning or intent of the provisions. FCIC also adds two new Options to the Potato Crop Insurance Regulationsfor the 1989 crop year, as follows:1. The Frost/Freeze Option (7 CFR 422.10), is a modification of the frost/freezechart formerly used in conjunction with the 1986 loss adjustment procedures.This Option may be added to a grower's basic policy at an additional premium.2. The Processing Potato Quality Option (7 CFR 422.11), may also be addedto a grower's basic policy for an additional premium. This Option providesquality adjustment specifically for processing potatoes. Its availabilitywill initially be limited to two counties. The current Quality Potato Optionwill provide quality adjustment for both fresh and processing potatoesin other selected counties. After insuring experience is analyzed, useof this Processing Potato Quality Option may be expanded. On Friday, October 28, 1988, FCIC published a notice of proposed rulemakingin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 53 FR 43719, to (1) revise and reissue theQuality Potato Option to make the option continuous and to define ``acceptableinspection''; (2) add a new Frost/Freeze Option to provide coverage againstfrost and freeze, and (3) add a new Processing Potato Quality Option asa means of providing insurance on potatoes produced under contract witha processor. The public was given 30 days in which to submit written comments, data,and opinions on the proposed rule, but none were received. Therefore, FCICherewith adopts, without change, the proposed rule published at 53 FR 43719as a final rule. Section 422.7(d)16 of the Potato Crop Insurance Regulations provides thatthe earliest date by which any change to the policy must be filed in orderto be effective for the 1989 crop year is December 31, 1988. The policyamendments herein were placed on file in all service offices in accordancewith this provision. Therefore, good cause is shown for making these regulationseffective on December 31, 1988, to coincide with the date such regulationswere on file. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 422</ITAG>Crop insurance, Potatoes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final rule</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop InsuranceAct, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 <T3>et seq</T3>.), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation hereby amendsthe Potato Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR Part 422), effective for the1989 and succeeding crop years, in the following instances:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 422_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
