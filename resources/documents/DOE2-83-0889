The increase of CO/sub2/ in the atmosphere threatens to cause changes of our climate (greenhouseeffect). Hydrogen and its ecologically neutral combustion product H/sub2/O as 'clean source of energy' could serve as a remedy. This element,which has been thoroughly researched and described in detail, is introducedhere briefly. Given the huge amounts of water on earth, it is availablefor exploitation in abundance. Under the concept of Solar-Hydrogen Technology,H/sub 2/ - in conjunction with solar energy - is planned to be introducedon a large technical scale as an ecologically neutral source of energy.It seems that problems of production, storage, transport and handlingof this gas have been technically solved, even for the amounts involvedhere. The difficulties to be expected in implementing this concept, whichis still in its infancy, are shown using the example of a Solar-HydrogenProject in Bavaria. It will probably take several decades, until a significanthydrogen-based industry has been established, and curtailment of thisconcept cannot be excluded.</TEXT></DOC>
