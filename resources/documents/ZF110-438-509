One of the few names we can think of offhand is the late RobertNoyce, who had both Fairchild Semiconductor and intel on his scorecardalthough of course the former was a subsidiary of another company.andP;  Perhapsreaders with longer memories than ours can extend the list; a suitable prizewill be awarded.andM;What interests us is not so much the past as the future.andP;  And specificallythe future of Ken Oshman and Mike Markkula, who as president andvice-chairman, respectively, of a young company called Echelon are in aposition to score an unprecedented dual victory in the second-chance event.andO;Mr. Oshman, a founder of ROLM, and Mr. Markkula, a founder of Apple Computerand an early marketing manager at Intel, have reputations so enormous inSilicon Valley that it took them no more than a long weekend to raise $25million for Echelon - $15 million more than they had sought.andM;That wa-) two years ago.andP;  A few weeks from now, after Echelon has rolled outits first products, the world will finally begin to assess in detail thelikelihood that this company can be a vehicle for the kind of success thatits leaders have experienced in the past.andP;  In the meantime, we have beenthinking about the size of the challenge Echelon is facing and the strategicdecisions that lie ahead.andM;The possibilities are mind-expanding.andP;  Echelon proposes to lead the way inextending the benefits of inexpensive distributed intelligence to the worldoutside the computer industry.andP;  In other words, to repeat the personalcomputer phenomenon by setting a universal communications and controlstandard for everything from home and factory automation to avionics andautomotive electronics.andM;There are hardly any limits to the applications one might dream up for ageneral-purpose intelligent network that is cheap and easy to implement.andP;  Asthe chart on the next page shows, Echelon has identified five major markets,plus a catchall &quot;other&quot; category, where the potential for intelligent devicesor nodes of various kinds can be measured in the billions of units.andM;Pretty clearly, the opportunity is a big one.andP;  Equally clearly, Echelon isnot the first company to figure that out.andP;  In some market segments-automotive, for example - the microelectronic revolution started two decadesago.andP;  In others, such as home security and control, dozens of companies haveinvested years of effort and millions of dollars on bus or network standardsthat won't be discarded lightly.andM;Numbers gameandM;None of these markets will develop overnight, and Echelon will be lucky towin even a fractional share of some of them.andP;  Of course, a fraction of abillion is still a large number.andP;  But the odds against riding this particularvehicle into the ranks of the industrial elite, we have to conclude, arelong.andM;We certainly buy Mr. Markkula's vision that the hierarchy of computerintelligence ought to have a low end, well below $ 100, and that the arrivalof technology to distribute inexpensive intelligence throughout a home oroffice building or factory should create a tremendous market.andP;  Mr. Markkula,a home automation buff who was frustrated by the lack of basic buildingblocks for his hobby, started working on the problem in 1985.andP;  By 1988 he wasfar enough along to raise $5 million in seed financing for Echelon fromseveral of Apple's original backers and from Apple itself.andP;  Then he prevailedon Mr. Oshman to sign on as chief executive.andM;Play it again, KenandM;That was quite a coup, considering that Mr. Oshman had told himself he wouldnot do another startup.andP;  Mr. Markkula convinced him that Echelon would offernot only another chance to create a major company but also an opportunity tochange the way people work and live.andP;  &quot;It looked like a unique thing to do,&quot;Mr. Oshman says.andP;  He is not just lending his name to this venture.andP;  The factthat a Ken Oshman is working 12 hours a day to build this company gives it ahigh level of credibility.andP;  That was clear in the oversubscribed $25 millionfirst-round financing, which valued the company at a healthy $55 million.andM;Two's a crowdandM;And credibility will be all-important as Echelon sets out to translate Mr.andO;Markkula's vision into a widely-adopted standard for control andcommunications networks.andP;  We don't know the details of Echelon's approach,but we doubt that technology will be the critical factor in building thecompany.andP;  Much more important will be the marketing and distributionstrategies Echelon employs, and above all its ability to enlist championsamong major participants in the diverse markets it is addressing.andM;A major credibility-building event was the announcement back in February thatEchelon had lined up Motorola and Toshiba to manufacture and sell theintegrated circuits implementing its system.andP;  If the so-called LON (for localoperating network) standard catches on, it win require a flood of low-costchips from multiple sources.andP;  Multiple usually means more than two, andEchelon may eventually choose to license others to make the parts.andP;  But it'shard to quibble when the two initial sources are among the biggestsemiconductor companies in the world.andM;Step right upandM;Motorola and Toshiba will certainly play a key role in developing markets forEchelon, both as missionaries with the systems divisions in their owncompanies and as worldwide distributors of components.andP;  They also have theright to go beyond making Echelon-designed circuits with new versions oftheir own.andP;  All of which, if the commitment holds up, should create aformidable supporting cast.andM;The problem Echelon and its partners will face, however, is also a formidableone.andP;  They must convince hundreds of companies across several industries togive up proprietary approaches or hard-fought industry standards innetworking and sign up for a novel architecture from an untested supplier.andO;It will be absolutely vital for Echelon to start off with a long list ofbig-name early adopters in order to establish momentum quickly.andP;  But eventhat may not suffice, since for the most part these are highly fragmentedmarkets with no dominant figure to lead the way as IBM has done so often incomputing.andM;It's certainly not impossible for a handful of companies, even small ones, tocircumvent the ponderous standard-setting process and advance a solution sopowerful that it becomes a de facto standard.andP;  The shining example ofEthernet, developed as an informal standard by Digital Equipment, Xerox, andIntel, springs to mind.andP;  So, on the other hand, does the ManufacturingAutomation Protocol (MAP), which despite the heroic efforts of GeneralMotors, the world's largest industrial company, has not captured many heartsand minds.andM;Home smart homeandM;An example of what Echelon may be up against can be found in the long-runningstruggle to set standards for home automation.andP;  The idea of an &quot;intelligenthouse&quot; that starts breakfast, locks the doors, adjusts room temperature, andturns on your favorite rock music station - all automatically - has beenaround for many years.andP;  Echelon expects home automation to be an importantmarket for its technology, although probably not the first to develop.andM;House of babbleandM;In fact, the market already exists.andP;  Relatively primitive or extremelyexpensive residential controller equipment will generate sales of around $1billion this year.andP;  As the chart on this page shows, the market researchfolks at Parks Associates expect sales of high-end central controls toquintuple over the next five years as standards emerge and prices fall.andO;Furthermore, widespread installation of home automation networks might beexpected to stimulate sales of feature-rich appliances and entertainmentproducts.andP;  And home builders look to the wonders of electronics to breathenew excitement into a stagnant industry.andM;This won't happen without a widely accepted standard ensuring that microwaveovens, stereo receivers, security systems - even light switches - all speakthe same language.andP;  Two major efforts to bring this about have been creepingalong since the mid-1980s.andP;  One is the Smart House Project sponsored by theNational Association of Home Builders, in which sixteen American companiesare developing a new wiring topology, along with a communications and controltechnology to provide centralized control.andP;  The partners will own Smart Housetechnology and license it only to those who meet their requirements.andM;While some major names in electrical equipment and appliances are involved inSmart House, its exclusive nature suggests that a broader standard willultimately prevail.andM;Standard issueandM;Under the auspices of the Electronic Industries Association, some 300companies have been laboring since 1984 to bring forth such a standard.andP;  TheCEBus committee, instigated by General Electric, North American Philips, andMatsushita, has the breadth and the international support needed to produce atrue standard.andP;  But the large number of companies involved has forced thestandard-setting process to move at a snail's pace.andM;Last summer, when the CEBus committee seemed ready to take a final vote onthe standard, Echelon jumped in to demand another look at a key element ofthe standard.andP;  That ruffled a few feathers, but the committee issued a formalrequest for proposal, giving Echelon until midNovember to present itstechnology as an alternative if it chooses to do so.andM;Signal achievementandM;Some members of the CEBus committee call Echelon's action simply a delayingtactic intended to derail a competing standard.andP;  Echelon denies this,insisting there are serious shortcomings in the criteria the committee isusing.andP;  If an inferior or unreliable technical standard is chosen, runs theEchelon argument, the whole concept of home automation could get a black eye.andM;At issue is the method for sending signals over the power lines that couldprovide a convenient communications network in every home and officebuilding.andP;  The original CEBus signaling technology, known as amplitude shiftkeying or ASK, had been adopted by the committee despite reliability problemsand a data rate of only 1,000 bits per second.andP;  A faster and more reliableapproach, developed by a small company called Intellon, won a technologycompetition last year and was to be part of the final standard until Echelonentered the picture.andM;Last chanceandM;Echelon isn't saying if it indeed plans to offer its own signaling technologyas an alternative to the Intellon design, which is based on a militaryconcept for spreading signals over a wide transmission spectrum.andP;  Coping withnoisy and unpredictable power lines appears to be the issue of most concernto CEBus supporters, and if Echelon is to have any chance to influence thestandard it would be in this area.andM;One size fits allandM;Echelon's earlier attempts to sell its communications protocol as a standardwere rebuffed by the committee, which felt that the problem had already beensolved.andP;  As we understand it, both Echelon and CEBus use a cost-reducedvariation on the Ethernet protocols for allowing multiple devices tocommunicate while detecting and avoiding collisions of data.andM;Because Echelon is aiming at many applications beyond home automation, it hasapparently made its protocol programmable so that the same device can fitinto several environments.andP;  That makes sense.andP;  The protocol that handles1,000 responses from temperature sensors scattered through a building isn'tlikely to suit the controls on a jet aircraft, which may need only oneresponse (from a wing flap, say) but must be absolutely reliable.andM;Echelon may also have found a way to make its signaling technology faster andmore immune to outside interference than the Intellon approach.andP;  If so, andif it hasn't raised the cost of the technology in the process, the companymight have a chance to reopen the issue with CEBus.andP;  Otherwise, it will haveto market the &quot;LONWorks&quot; concept against the inertia of a widely adoptedindustry standard.andM;The equalizerandM;The big advantage Echelon would have in such a contest, aside from anytechnical differences, is its ability to offer a complete package of devicesand development tools across a wide range of markets.andP;  Mr. Oshman promises toinvest $50 million getting Echelon's technology to market, an amount thatmight be hard to justify for Texas Instruments, which is producing a chipthat implements the CEBus design and thus has a more limited availablemarket.andP;  (Echelon still has plenty of money; we think its bum rate has aboutequaled the interest on the capital it has pulled in).andM;Nevertheless, Echelon will be bucking considerable sentiment favoring anofficial industry standard.andP;  Tandy, for example, which is perhaps the largestretailer of low-cost home automation equipment, provided the computerhardware and software for a prototype CEBus demonstration at the lastConsumer Electronics Show.andP;  Tandy will lean in favor of an open standard,although its main interest is in getting a large number of controllablehousehold products on the market as soon as possible.andM;How to raise IQsandM;Echelon may find it easier to find adherents in less glamorous industries,where the standards committees are not as far along as in home automation.andO;In building automation, for example, the high cost of centralized controlshas limited the market.andP;  Conceivably, Echelon's distributed intelligencescheme, in which a personal computer can be a building controller, willtrigger a wholesale shift to smart thermostats, lights, security cameras, andair conditioning.andM;In automotive electronics, the process of integrating isolated sensors andactuators is just beginning, and communication standards have not yet beencast in concrete.andP;  In factory automation, Echelon sees opportunities inproviding local intelligence that would reduce the need for centralizedcomputing power.andM;In an effort to encourage widespread adoption of its technology, Echelonplans to keep license fees and royalties low.andP;  Since Motorola and Toshibawill be selling the basic hardware, the question arises as to how Echelonwill make a living.andP;  Mr. Oshman replies that the company will sell variousspecialized parts and tools to its original equipment customers and possiblyenter the systems business directly.andP;  But the real answer, of course, is thatEchelon's technology must become truly widespread if it is to be a largecompany.andM;Dreams and realitiesandM;As the tables on Pages 4 and 5 show, the potential applications in all thefields Echelon is pursuing are numerous - as are the proposed protocolstandards that Echelon must either defeat or coexist with.andP;  Perhaps thebiggest challenge Echelon will face is overcoming the skepticism that hasbuilt up in the 20 years or so of largely unrealized predictions about aworld of intelligent houses and brainy cars.andM;The benefits of distributing microelectronics into all the crevices ofeveryday living are easy enough to dream up.andP;  The practical problems oftransferring that technology into hostile and unfamiliar environments ataffordable prices have proved not so easy to solve.andM;Key man insuranceandM;Even if Echelon can accomplish this technical miracle, it will need a strongportfolio of alliance partnerships to capture any significant share of themarkets it is going after.andP;  In that regard, Echelon's strongest card may beits management team, and in particular its chief executive.andP;  &quot;I wouldn't tryto do this without an Oshman,&quot; says an investor.andP;  Mr. Oshman has contacts andrelationships that run beyond Silicon Valley to the industrial companies thatwill be crucial to Echelon's strategy.andP;  He also has the experience ofbuilding a company by pushing a new technology into a hidebound industry.andO;Now he has the chance to perform the same trick several times over.andP;  Wewouldn't bet against him.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
