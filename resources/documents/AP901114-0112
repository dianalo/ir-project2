The measure applies to all states and all illegal drugs,including the 10 states where possession of small amounts ofmarijuana has been decriminalized but is still considered aninfraction of the law.   The legislation, included in the transportation appropriationsbill for the current fiscal year, got little attention during theflurry of activity as Congress rushed to leave town at the end ofOctober.   News that the measure had become law drew criticism from groupsas diverse as the National Governors Association and the NationalOrganization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.   The legislation calls for withholding 5 percent of federalhighway funds starting Oct. 1, 1993 from states that fail to imposesix-month suspensions on drivers convicted of a drug offense. Thecut would increase to 10 percent on Oct. 1, 1995.   About half the states now allow suspension of drug offenders'licenses, but only New Jersey, Colorado, Georgia and Pennsylvaniahave mandated such suspensions for drivers of all ages, accordingto Liz Gibson of the American Legislative Exchange Council.   Passed Oct. 27 and signed by Bush on Nov. 5, the measureaccomplishes in large part what national drug control policydirector William J. Bennett tried to impose more than a year ago.But White House chief of staff John Sununu, a former governor ofNew Hampshire, blocked that effort, arguing that states should beallowed to decide such matters for themselves, administrationsources say.   The new legislation notes that states can reject the rules andstill obtain federal funding if their legislatures votespecifically against requiring the license suspensions and theirgovernors go on record in agreement with that position.   ``This forces the states to be accountable,'' said anadministration source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We'renot going to force you, but if you don't want to do it, you'll haveto be public about it.''   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., who pushed the amendment, saidhis main targets were New York and California, which have bothdecriminalized marijuana. Both also have splits in party control:In California, the Democrats control the legislature, the governoris a Republican; in New York, the governor is a Democrat and hisparty controls the state assembly while Republicans control thestate senate.   ``Seventy-five percent of the drug purchases in America are doneby casual drug users, and that's white, upper-middle classAmericans that drive their Pontiac Firebirds into the ghetto andbuy these killer drugs,'' Solomon said.   ``You don't see the murders take place out in the suburbs, butit's the casual drug user who supplies the demand for thesedrugs,'' he said. ``If you do away with the demand for drugs, thenthe drugs will dry up in this country. ... When it starts to affecttheir livelihoods, maybe then they'll stop using these drugs.''   But license suspensions wouldn't necessarily affect theirlivelihoods, because they would receive limited driving permitsenabling them to continue commuting to work, he said.   In the current fiscal year, the Federal Highway Administrationwill distribute some $12.3 billion to the states. Of that total,California will get the largest chunk, some $1.1 billion. New Yorkis to get $666 million.   Nolan Jones, staff director for the National Governors'Association's justice and public safety committee, said his groupfought the measure last summer and still opposes it.   ``Numerous states have driver's license revocation laws, butthey don't go as far as this calls for,'' Jones said. ``That pointsto why we are against the whole issue of mandates when looking atthis sort of problem.''   Criticism also came from Lester Lamm, president of the HighwayUsers Federation for Safety and Mobility, which includes everythingfrom road builders to insurance companies and automobile clubs.   ``In many cass, they're holding a program hostage for somethingthat the program managers have no say over,'' Lamm said. ``Thestate departments of transportation don't have any role in thecriminalization of drug possession.''   NORML, which has urged the legalization of marijuana for twodecades, also denounced the new legislation, saying, ``It seemsludicrous that we would take our concerns with drugs and somehowtransform them to a completely different area, i.e. transportationand money for roads.''</TEXT></DOC>
