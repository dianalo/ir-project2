DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Gov. Michael Dukakis out of state campaigningfor president, Massachusetts ended the fiscal year with a nearly$400 million deficit Thursday and headed into the new fiscal yearwithout a budget.   Dukakis awaited final action by the Legislature on his plan toclose the books on fiscal year 1988 and on a compromise spendingplan for 1989.   At the same time, a series of tax bills and fee-raising measuresto help the state pay for expanded spending in fiscal 1989 nearedenactment.   The Revenue Department, meanwhile, was busy opening envelopes ina drive to collect every possible tax dollar that can be attributedto fiscal 1988.   The agency will not close its books before next week, but oneadministration official said Thursday that there was ``no goodnews'' in the final month of the fiscal year.   The Dukakis administration has acknowledged that stategovernment is technically $397 million short for 1988.   To deal with that shortfall, the governor has filed the finalsupplemental budget of the year, a proposal that includes a plan totap cash reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close thegap. State law requires a balanced budget.   In recent years, Massachusetts has often gone several days oreven weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget.   House Minority Leader Steven Pierce charged Thursday that it was``inconceivable'' that the governor would be out of statecampaigning with the budget crisis unresolved.   Dukakis spokesman Steve Crawford said the government would be inhis office Friday, Saturday and possibly Monday.   ``He is in constant contact with his office. His chief of staffand his secretary of administration and finance are regularlydiscussing the budget process with legislative leaders,'' Crawfordsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
