TheU.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends lead in drinking water notexceed 15 parts per billion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WINE INDUSTRY REELING UNDER LEAD FINDINGSRANDOM TESTS SHOW LEVELS THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     A spokeswoman for the BATF said imported wines tended to have higher levelsof lead than domestic wines but that none of the tested wines was lead-free.;   The bureau does not intend to release test results -- or even name the winesit has tested -- before finishing additional testing, probably in four to sixmonths. Spokeswoman Dot Koester said she didn't know how many of the testedwines were from California, which accounts for about 90 percent of U.S. wineproduction.;    News of the bureau results has left industry officials baffledand wary.;    &quot;It's something none of us has ever been aware of,&quot; said EileenFredrikson of Gomberg and Fredrikson, a San Francisco-based wine industryconsulting firm.;    The lead revelation comes on the heels of controversyover sulfites and health-warning labels on wine, at a time when the industryis struggling with a decline in U.S. wine consumption.;    &quot;There will be somenegative impact. There probably already has been some,&quot; Fredrikson said of thelead issue.;    Paul Gillette, editor and publisher of the Wine Investor, anindustry newsletter, said that if the problem can't easily be corrected, itcould do to the wine industry what the pesticide Alar did to the appleindustry.;    A report by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1989 saidchildren faced a high cancer risk from eating Alar-treated apples. Alar wasused to preserve freshness in apples, but has been withdrawn from the U.S.market.;    The report caused an outcry among consumers and losses of up to$140 million to Washington state apple growers, who supply 60 percent of thenation's fresh-apple crop.;    Neither industry officials nor regulators knowhow lead is getting into wine.;    Much of the speculation has centered onlead-foil wrappers placed over the neck of wine bottles. Also known as&quot;hoods,&quot; the wrappers reportedly triggered a U.S. Food and Drug Administrationrequest that the bureau test wines for lead.;    But most wineries switchedyears ago from lead foil to plastic or other types of wrappers, according toGillette, who considers the wrappers an unlikely suspect anyway. Noting thatthe wrapper or hood is placed over the cork, he said that the wine never comesin contact with the hood.;    Industry representatives said virtually nowineries have lead in their plumbing or wine-making systems anymore.;    Otherpotential sources of lead range from the bottles themselves to the soil orgroundwater that supports grape vines.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  McClatchy News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910611  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  471  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 11, 199100163180,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
