The claim was made in a letter received Wednesday by WAGA-TV inAtlanta from a group calling itself Americans for a CompetentFederal Judicial System, said Al Adams, a spokesman for the PostalInspection Service in Atlanta.   The letter was postmarked Dec. 21 in Atlanta. An NAACP officialsaid his organization received a similar letter on Dec. 22.   In its 6 p.m. news broadcast, WAGA-TV released excerpts of theletter from the group, which claimed it ``assassinated Judge RobertS. Vance and attorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocitiescommitted on Julie Love,'' a white woman who was robbed, raped andmurdered in Atlanta in 1988.   ``Two more prominent members of the NAACP shall be assassinated,using more sophisticated means, as part of the same reprisal,'' theletter said.   William L. Hinshaw, special agent in charge of the FBIinvestigation in Atlanta, said in a statement Thursday evening thatnone of the agencies investigating the mail bombings was familiarwith the group.   ``We believe that the letter received by WAGA is authenticbecause it contained information which has not been made known tothe public and which is known only to someone closely associatedwith the construction and mailing of the bombs, and to lawenforcement,'' Hinshaw said.   He said the letter made a threat against the television stationif it did not air portions of the letter.   ``Because the letter indicated that additional attacks might beforthcoming if the TV station did not comply with the stated demandto read a portion of the letter, we encouraged WAGA to broadcastthat portion of the letter and distribute this information to othernews organizations,'' Hinshaw said.   WAGA reported at 11 p.m. that the letter told of a secretmeeting the group held Dec. 19 in Montgomery, Ala., after the twofatal bombings. The station said members from Georgia, Florida andAlabama gathered ``to draft new orders'' and to go public withtheir mission.   ``Investigators have confirmed to officials of WAGA-TV that thedocument may be authentic and related to the recent bombingattacks,'' Hinshaw said.   Authorities have been investigating a series of mail bombs thatkilled Vance, an 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge at hishome near Birmingham, Ala., on Dec. 16 and Robinson, a Savannah,Ga., lawyer two days later.   The bomb that killed Vance was mailed to his home in MountainBrook, Ala., the same suburb where Ms. Love grew up.   ``Anytime a black man rapes a white woman in Alabama, Florida orGeorgia in the future, Americans for a Competent Federal JudicialSystem shall assassinate one federal judge, one attorney and oneofficer of the NAACP,'' the letter said.   The group criticized the 11th Circuit on which Vance served, forwhat it called reluctance ``to stress the importance of blacks todemonstrate civil responsibility.''   ``This failure created a climate that has spawned an alarmingnumber of savage acts of violence by black men against whitewomen,'' the letter said.   It cited the slaying of Ms. Love, 27, a pre-school fitnessteacher who disappeared July 11, 1988, after her car ran out ofgas. Her remains were found a little over a year later, in a woodedlot near an inner-city neighborhood.   Two young black men, Emmanuel Fitzgerald Hammond, 24, andWilliam Maurice Porter, 20, have been charged in the slaying.Porter pleaded guilty in November and is expected to testifyagainst Hammond in his forthcoming trial.   Sources close to the bomb investigation said last week thatfollow-up threatening letters received by targets of the mail bombscontained references to ``Americans for a Competent Judiciary.'' Atthe time, the FBI said it did not know the significance of thereferences.   Two other bombs were safely removed from the 11th Circuitbuilding in Atlanta and NAACP headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.   Investigators believe the attacks may have been carried out bywhite racists.   Earl Shinhoster, Southeastern regional director for the NAACP,said security precautions were being taken by NAACP workers at the600 Southeastern branches, 130 of which are in Georgia.   Shinhoster said he received an unsigned letter at his officeDec. 22 that used similar language as that in the letter sent toWAGA. But the television station's letter, Shinhoster said, ``ismuch more specific.''   The typewritten letter to the NAACP, also postmarked in Atlanta,also mentioned the Americans for a Competent Federal JudicialSystem.   Before being appointed to the federal bench, Vance preachedmoderation on racial issues while chairman of the AlabamaDemocratic Party. Robinson, a Savannah city alderman, was black anddid legal work for the NAACP.   A Hagerstown, Md., judge was wounded by a bomb last week, butinvestigators said they have all but ruled out a connection to theother attacks.   On Aug. 21, an anonymous letter was sent to Jackson, Miss., TVstation WAPT declaring war on the 11th Circuit, authorities said.The next day, a tear gas canister exploded at the Atlanta office ofthe Atlanta NAACP, injuring eight people.   Vickie Taylor, assignment editor at WAPT, said Thursday that theAugust letter was not signed by any group in particular but thatit, too, complained in similar language about partiality in thejudiciary.   Ms. Taylor said her station has not received any follow-upletters recently.</TEXT></DOC>
