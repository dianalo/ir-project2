 Office ofManagement and Budget officials have said the review may lead to new datarequirements.andP;  But, they said, it is too early to tell if Congress will callfor greater agency accountability.andM;For two years the OFPP's Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC) has reportedthat agencies improperly filed procurement data to its database.andM;&quot;There's been no formal attempt to see why and correct it.andP;  Occasionally anagency's inspector general will look at the data, see what it is wrong andshake a stick, but it varies according to agency management,&quot; said GraftonBiglow, the center's senior program analyst.andP;  &quot;Those dollars not getting intoour system are not getting reported.&quot;andM;Established in 1978, the FPDC is run by the General Services Administrationon behalf of OFPP and maintains an automated database of all agencyprocurements worth $25,000 or more.andP;  The system contains information on onlysigned contracts and does not include any in-house services.andM;The database provides government and the private sector with information suchas the agency originating a contract, the contracting office, the contractnumber, date of award, performance site, total project budget and the methodof solicitation.andM;The database resides in a time-sharing system managed by GSA's Washingtonregional office.andP;  Computer Network Services Inc. of Washington is the currentsystem contractor.andM;The center publishes quarterly summaries of agency procurement actions andhow accurately each agency files the information.andP;  Biglow said the system'sedits ensure data accuracy by cross referencing procurement information suchas the name of a contractor against the type of contract.andP;  Agencies have 30days to correct any filings the system detects as inaccurate.andP;  Any figuresthat are not changed in time for publication are listed as &quot;invalid dollars.&quot;andM;&quot;The invalid dollars category is the absolute dollar figure of all recordsthat did not pass our edits.andP;  For any one error, regardless of the dataelement, the whole record is invalid and won't be put into any part of thereport,&quot; Biglow said.andP;  &quot;We cross check as many fields as possible.andP;  We havetables to check digit edits, contractor identification numbers, 8(a)authority and all sorts of relationship edits.&quot;andM;According to recent center reports, agencies have reported more than $414million invalid dollars each quarter for the past two years.andP;  In the firstquarter of 1987 agencies reported a total of $450.9 million invalid dollarsfollowed by $477.4 million in the second quarter.andP;  They reported $720.2million in the third quarter and more than $309 million in the fourthquarter.andP;  For the first quarter of 1988 agencies reported $480.5 million ininvalid dollars followed by $201.7 million in the second quarter, $320.3million in the third quarter and more than $350 million in the fourth.andM;Some agencies, such as the Defense Department and the Energy Department, seemto have no problem filing data.andP;  Yet others, such as the Agency forInternational Development, are consistently among agency leaders in invaliddollars.andP;  For example, in 1987 AID reported the most invalid dollars in threequarters.andM;Barry Knauf, chief of AID's Procurement Support Division, said some of theagency's reporting problems occur because AID must gather data from a numberof foreign offices.andP;  Knauf said he must rely on small staffs to clarifyprocurement issues in addition to complying with many other importantreporting requirements.andM;Biglow said accuracy of data depends on individual agency systems and theemphasis each organization places on gathering the information.andP;  The FPDCdoes not have authority to punish agencies for inaccurate reporting, Biglowsaid, and its only leverage is to make the quarterly reports public.andM;&quot;We publish the report card and thought the publicity would be sufficientenough,&quot; Biglow said.andP;  &quot;One would think management would pursue theseperiodically and be somewhat embarrassed.andP;  It's the only real stick we have.andO;It's the responsibility of the agency to report timely, accurate and completedata and police themselves.&quot;andM;Biglow said the data is valuable because agencies use it to enforceprocurement regulations.andP;  Members of Congress have on-line access to it.andM;&quot;It's used extensively throughout government,&quot; Biglow said.andP;  &quot;It's generatedfor other agencies to help meet mission goals.andP;  Labor uses it for contractcompliance oversight so it can ensure contractors comply with law and we arenow required to report data to the Internal Revenue Service under the new taxlaw.&quot;andM;The agencies need to put the time, materials and emphasis into doing a goodjob, Biglow said.andP;  &quot;When you have a poor reporting job by an agency it canaccount for the bulk of invalid dollars.andP;  Some consistently have errors whileothers have none.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
