The separation of a solar collecting andan oscillating portion serves to increase the degree of freedom. Thecore of the optical fiber is composed of quartz, and a polymer claddingtype having a large number of apertures. The input end of the fiber isa heat resistant air-cladding type. The fibre has a transmission of 93%,which is satisfactory for use. The optical excitation system is composedof, in combination, an elliptically cylindrical laser mirror and a cylindricallaser mirror, both of which have an internal surface gold-plated throughout.The output beam from the fiber is multiple-refracted to excite the laserefficiently. When laser beam with low intensity excited by a lamp ismade to pass through a crystal of the above excitation system, the intensityis amplified. It is planned that direct laser oscillation is realizedby increase of solar radiation intensity. (9 figs, 5 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
