Stevens In Another Takeover Agreement; Is Bidding Over?</BYLINE><HEAD>With PM-Stevens-Glance</HEAD><BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Textile industry analysts say the bidding maynot be over for J.P. Stevens andamp; Co., even though the company hasaccepted a nearly $1 billion cash buyout offer from an investmentgroup.   A group led by Odyssey Partners of New York announced Monday itagreed to pay $61.50 in cash for each of Stevens' 15.5 millionshares outstanding, or about $953.24 million.   The offer is subject to a majority of the shares being tenderedand the necessary financing being obtained.   Analysts called Odyssey's bid fair, although some said theythought the bidding could continue.   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens' stockjumped $5.37{ a share to close at $61.12{.   Over the past few weeks, Stevens has fielded rival offers fromAtlanta-based West Point-Pepperell Inc. and a group led by its ownsenior management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens, a fifthgeneration member of the family that founded the company in 1813.   The management group offered $55 a share in cash and securitiesin a leveraged buyout about two weeks ago, up from its initialoffer of $43 a share. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquiredlargely with borrowed money repaid with a target company's profitsor the sales of assets.   West Point-Pepperell, a major household fabrics maker withbrands that include Arrow, Martex and Lady Pepperell, offered tobuy Stevens for $56 a share in cash, or about $867 million. Thecompany confirmed Monday it had considered raising its offer to$62.50 a share, but had not made a formal bid at the higher price.   West Point-Pepperell refused to comment on what, if any, furtheraction it might take.   ``The arbitragers think there could be more bidding,'' saidEdward Johnson, a textile analyst with Johnson Redbook, a divisionof Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc. ``A deal is never done until allthe stock is signed over.''   George O. Zimmerman, an analyst with Gruntal andamp; Co., said ahigher offer could torpedo the deal with Odyssey. ``I think they'llhave to take the highest bid,'' he said.   Odyssey is a private investment company. Its deals have includedthe purchase of a controlling interest in Lucky Stores Inc.'s EagleFood Stores, located in the Midwest, and a leveraged buyout ofResearch Cottrell Inc., a pollution control, engineering andconstruction company.   Odyssey said it would finance the deal with a $600 million loanfrom Citibank, $570 million from the sale subordinated debt andpreferred stock and $100 million in equity investment.   Should the deal go through, Johnson predicted, Odyssey likelycould sell parts of Stevens to pay off its debt.   Stevens already undertook a major restructuring about five yearsago, selling off some of its finished fabrics divisions toconcentrate more on home furnishings.   New York-based Stevens, one of the nation's biggest textilemakers with 23,000 employees, produces home fashion textiles suchas sheets, towels and carpets under the brand names Ralph Lauren,Laura Ashley and Pierre Cardin. The company also makes automotiveproducts and industrial products.   The company had an after-tax profit of $56 million on sales of$1.6 billion in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31.</TEXT></DOC>
