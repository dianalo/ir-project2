Union Bank of Switzerland began the trend with anannouncement Feb. 28 of a coming split. Since then, bankersBaer Holding AG, paper manufacturers Holzstoff Holding AG,machinery producer Gebrueder Sulzer AG and aluminum-chemicalconcern Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG have followed suit.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts are betting on which company will come next.Nestle S.A. is viewed as a sure thing. Waiting in the wings,the analysts say, are quality controllers Societe Generale deSurveillance Holding, insurer Winterthur, retailersInterdiscount-Holding S.A., computer product manufacturerLogitech International S.A. and chemical-pharmaceuticalconcerns Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG.   The announced plans to split stocks are the result of arevised Swiss Company Law that will go into effect July 1.The new legislation lowers the minimum legal par value ofshares to 10 Swiss francs ($6.57) from 100 francs, making itpossible for companies to easily split their stock.   &quot;We are going to see split after split after split,&quot;exclaims Beat Philipp, who heads Swiss research at BankVontobel.   Looking at the weight of some Swiss shares, the surpriseis that splits haven't become regular practice sooner. Nestleshares trade at more than 9,000 francs, Baer and Surveillanceat more than 8,000 francs, UBS at a little under 4,000 francsand Ciba-Geigy at well over 3,000 francs.   &quot;The small investor buys one Nestle {share} today, ifthat,&quot; says Zurich financial writer Werner Leibacher.   The main targets of Swiss splits, however, are non-Swissinvestors. Says Ulrich Grete, executive vice president ofUBS: &quot;By international standards, our shares are highlypriced. Given the growing interest shown by foreigninvestors, the need to move into line with internationaltrends cannot be underestimated.&quot;   By attracting more international investors through lighterstock, Swiss companies hope to raise share values. That's anincreasingly attractive prospect at a time when companiesexpanding globally are seeking to make the most of capitalresources, analysts say.   A study of the U.S. equities market by Lombard Odier andamp;Cie., a private banking firm in Geneva, showed that splitsincrease shares' values by 3% to 5%. However, Lombard Odierfinancial analyst Serge Ledermann warns: &quot;The Swiss marketisn't quite the same as the U.S. We believe that splits inthemselves will not bring a lot.&quot;   His view is backed up by Gilbert Puder, who heads researchat Bank Sarasin in Basel. &quot;I'm not so sure shares will riseas a result of splits,&quot; He says. &quot;Maybe splits will help abit.&quot;   However, analysts say that splits lead to other changes.For example, Swiss companies in the past created favorablypriced participation certificates, or non-voting shares, forsmaller investors. With the price of voting shares reducedthrough splits, these certificates have less relevance. Manycompanies, such as UBS, Alusuisse-Lonza and Holzstoff, havedecided to do away with the certificates, thus simplifyingtheir share structure.   Analysts say that the common practice with Swiss companiesof having three share categories -- bearer shares, registeredshares and participation certificates -- is too complex forforeign investors. Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss research atBank Julius Baer, says that &quot;doing away with participationcertificates means we are on the way to a single-sharecategory. The Swiss market will become much more liquid.&quot;   On July 1, UBS plans to replace one old share with fivenew ones, bringing down the market price of its bearer stockat today's prices from around 3,790 francs to 758 francs.Sulzer's registered stock will be split 10-for-1, allowingshares to trade around 569 francs, instead of 5,690 francs.   Analysts say that splits are only one aspect of reformsushered in by the revised law. Says Mr. Kaufmann: &quot;the lawbrings significant improvements as far as investors areconcerned.&quot;   According to Mr. Kaufmann, some of those improvements are:   -- A company must disclose the structure of its ownership.   -- It must publish consolidated financial statements.   -- Willful refusal to register new shareholders won't beallowed, though companies still must limit the number ofshares for which one holder or group can be registered.   -- Discrimination of foreign investors is only allowed ifforeign ownership would violate a federal law. For example,this will affect insurance companies with large landholdings, as Switzerland has restrictions on foreignownership of real estate.   -- Shareholders owning 10% of the share capital or stockwith a par value of two million francs have the right todemand a special audit.   -- A shareholder owning stock with a par value of onemillion francs may put an item on the agenda of a generalmeeting.   -- Shareholders will have pre-subscription rights for newissues of convertible or warrant bonds.   Mr. Ledermann says the law is only one example of how theSwiss market is changing. Others are the adoption by manySwiss companies of international accounting standards, whichdemand more disclosure; corporate efforts to build upinvestor relations; increased competition in the financialservices sector; and a plan to combine regional tradingcenters in a national, electronic stock exchange.   &quot;A lot is happening in Switzerland,&quot; suggests Mr.Ledermann. &quot;The end result of all these reforms . . . couldbe very powerful for the market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
