This current is driven by the difference between the depths ofthe potential wells on the two sides of the dinuclear window. It is notincluded in the conventional descriptions of heavy ion processes, whichassume a current dependent only upon the difference between the nucleonicchemical potential energies. Accumulating data on the N- and Z-driftsobserved in deep inelastic collisions also contradict the conventionaldescription. By careful exact calculation with the one-dimensional Schroedingermodel, the permeation current is here quantified and then extended tothree dimensions. The resulting corrections are qualitatively such asto ameliorate the discrepancies between the observations and the conventionaldescription.</TEXT></DOC>
