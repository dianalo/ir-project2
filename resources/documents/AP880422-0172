KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Advocates of redesigning the nation's pennies,nickels dimes and quarters held out the prospect Friday thatexcited coin collectors would hand the Treasury a multi-billiondollar, deficit-reducing, windfall profit.   But the director of the U.S. Mint, testifying before the SenateBanking Commttee, predicted only small-change proceeds ranging inthe millions of dollars, not billions.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said any profit from a redesignedcoin would be welcome.   ``I suspect that glimmer of black ink in our deficit-plaguedworld is, in itself, adequate reason for passage of this bill,'' hesaid.   Sixty-one senators and 90 House members have co-sponsoredlegislation authorizing the most sweeping redesign of the nation'scoinage since the early years of the century.   The bill would require a complete redesign of the tails of thecoins while reserving the heads for the five presidents presentlydisplayed there.   While the presidential portraits might themselves be somewhatredesigned, the coins would retain their present size, shape andcolor.   The bill requires the design of the tail of the quarter to carryfor two years a design commemorating the bicentennial of theConstitution.   Cranston said he would like to make some changes in the plan andsaid he will introduce a pair of amendments to do that.   He would reserve the face of two of the coins for a symbolicdesign and forbid their use to portray any person, living or dead.   That would mean that two of the five presidents now so honored _Lincoln on the penny, Jefferson on the nickel, Roosevelt on thedime, Washington on the quarter and John F. Kennedy on thehalf-dollar _ would lose their places in the nation's pockets andpurses.   Cranston said no president was featured on the nation's coinsuntil 1909 when Abraham Lincoln was granted the honor on his 100thbirthday.   Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower andKennedy got their coins within a year of their deaths, Cranstonsaid.   Cranston said he would also offer an amendment to enhance thevalue of the redesigned coins as educational tools by directingthat they be designed as symbols of such democratic principles asfreedom of speech, freedom of the press, due process of law, trialby jury, the right to vote and the separation of powers.   ``Coins are the most tangible symbols of our nation in our dailylives,'' Cranston said. ``We touch them, examine them, carry themaround in our pockets and purses in all our waking hours. ...People _ particularly young people _ will look at our coins andlearn what they stand for.''   Diane Wolf, a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts who hasbeen campaigning for redesigned coins for more than a year, hassaid the change could result in a $2.3 billion profit over sixyears.   The bill requires all profits be used to reduce the deficit.   David C. Harper, editor of Numismatic News, a coin collector'smagazine, testified that the $2.3 billion estimate resulted fromhis calculation of profits of the release of the coins at facevalue compared to their relatively low production prices and theseparate sales of mint and proof sets to collectors.   ``It is clear to me the government will make money on designchanges,'' he said. ``Only the size of the profit is undetermined.''   But Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, had far lowerestimates.   ``Embellished revenue estimates of $2.3 billion have been citedand some have looked to coin redesign as a panacea for budgetdeficits,'' she said.   ``Based on analyses of past demand patterns we estimate $224million in additional ... receipts will be generated in the firstsix years of the new designs and $18 million in additional profitsover the same period'' from sales to coin collectors.''   The mint director suggested that if a decision is made to changethe design of U.S. coins the changes should be made over a six-yearperiod with a new coin being issued at the beginning of each year.</TEXT></DOC>
