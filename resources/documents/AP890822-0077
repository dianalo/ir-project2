Thornburgh's contention on Sunday's NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''that Supreme Court actions indicate such a search would be permittedunder the First Amendment also drew criticism from Jane Kirtley,executive director of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of thePress.   ``I am repeatedly appalled that the attorney general seems tofeel justified in ignoring guidelines that have served both theinterests of the news media and the Justice Department very well for10 years,'' Kirtley said.   ``I think it shows a total lack of appreciation of the FirstAmendment interests that were recognized by his predecessors,'' shesaid.   Kirtley said the Supreme Court declined to hear a 1978 case thataddressed the issue, Reporters Committee vs. ATandamp;T.   The Justice Department has been investigating a news leak thisspring that led to a CBS News report on an FBI investigationinvolving Rep. William Gray, D-Pa. Various department officials havebeen questioned by FBI agents and at least one has appeared before agrand jury.   As stories about Gray abounded in the midst of the House partyleadership election, the Justice Department took the unusual step ofannouncing that he was not the subject of an investigation.   Gray was elected House Democratic whip.   A source said Monday that the Justice Department was consideringsubpoenaing the telephone records of CBS reporter Rita Braver, whofirst reported the story. The network learned about the possiblesubpoena and contacted the department, the source said.   Tom Goodman, a New York-based spokesman for CBS, said the recordshad not been subpoenaed. Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramiandeclined to comment.   Edwards, chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutionalrights, and Schumer, who chairs the subcommittee on criminaljustice, also denounced the department's plan to prosecutegovernment officials for leaking information.   ``You are invoking the statute on theft of government propertywhich really has nothing to do with leaks,'' Edwards and Schumerwrote. ``Congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks, andcertainly never intended the theft of property law to be used inthis way.''   The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended toprotect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution, was announcedAug. 2 in testimony submitted to Congress.   Thornburgh said Aug. 3 that he wouldn't prosecute reporters whoobtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would chargefederal officials who are their sources.   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved inmisusing sensitive information that comes to them in an officialcapacity,'' Thornburgh said.   Accurate leaks ``have a tendency to compromise ongoinginvestigations,'' he said. ``If they are inaccurate, they have atendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who arethe subject of the leak.''</TEXT></DOC>
