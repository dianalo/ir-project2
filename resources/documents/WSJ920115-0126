The official, Sani Ahmad, headed the Washingtonrepresentative office of Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational but left the U.S. for Pakistan afterinvestigators contacted him in 1990. He was arrested during areturn to the U.S. in which he intended to arrange for thesale of his home in Bethesda, Md.</LP><TEXT>   In an affidavit sworn last week, Christopher Headrick, aspecial agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,indicated that Mr. Ahmad was wanted in connection withinvestigations by a federal grand jury here and a state grandjury in Manhattan. The grand juries, the agent explained, areinvestigating &quot;allegations that former BCCI officers in theU.S. bribed public officials,&quot; among other things.   According to the agent's affidavit, John Moscow, anassistant district attorney in Manhattan, had learned from aninformant that &quot;Mr. Ahmad's duties as head of BCCI'sWashington, D.C., office included the bribery of certaingovernment officials.&quot; The affidavit said the informant alsoidentified Mr. Ahmad as BCCI's coordinator for &quot;certain typesof industrial espionage,&quot; including &quot;the giving and receivingof commercial bribes.&quot;   The affidavit identified the informant only as a&quot;longtime, high-ranking official with BCCI,&quot; and neitheridentified nor speculated on who received any bribes.   Mr. Ahmad was under detention here after his arrest as amaterial witness Friday at the home of a relative inWilliamsburg, Va. He hadn't been charged. He was expected tobe turned over to prosecutors in Manhattan as soon as today.Officials conducted the arrest after learning from theinformant that Mr. Ahmad planned to leave the U.S. over theweekend after a stay of about two weeks.   Authorities have long wondered whether the pattern ofpolitical chicanery that BCCI established elsewhere in theworld -- notably in Pakistan, Africa and Latin America --also reached into the U.S. It's unclear whether Mr. Ahmad'sarrest will push the BCCI case to a new level of scandal andintrigue, or whether it will prove another false lead in theeffort to establish the political dimension of the scandalhere. To date, no public officials in the U.S. have beencharged with receiving bribes from BCCI.   Well before the bank -- which was controlled by BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A. -- was seized by Westernregulators on accusations of fraud in July, speculationabounded about the role of BCCI's Washington office, whichMr. Ahmad headed in the late 1980s. Though it had no officialbanking operations here, the office maintained a staff ofnearly two dozen people and a stable of at least threeMercedes limousines and a Cadillac. In addition to Mr. Ahmad,the senior members of the office included several retiredhigh-ranking Pakistani government officials.   Amjad Awan, who was convicted of money-laundering chargeslast year in federal court in Tampa, Fla., also worked in theWashington office before transferring to BCCI's Miami officein the mid-1980s.   The arrest and joint questioning of Mr. Ahmad furthersignals stepped-up cooperation between investigators at thestate level in New York and the federal level here. RobertMorgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, has previouslyaccused the Justice Department of refusing to cooperate inhis investigation of BCCI.   State and federal officials also recently worked togetheron a plea agreement in which BCCI -- though none of theindividuals who operated it -- pleaded guilty to federalcriminal charges.</TEXT></DOC>
