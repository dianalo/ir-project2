Stock managers turned part of their holdings into cash totrim losses during the stock market slump. As a result, 51%of the $165 billion in stock portfolios tracked by the Indataunit of Gordon, Haskett andamp; Co. was running ahead of theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 Stock Index as of mid-December. Thatwas the best showing for the managers in the firm's annualreport going back nine years.</LP><TEXT>   But while many investment firms did no worse than themarket, and the final loss on stocks wasn't huge, the onsetof the bear market in 1990 jarred pension funds and other biginvestors accustomed to only gains during the market's nearlydecade-long runup.   The 1990 downturn &quot;has thrown real fear&quot; into pension-fundofficials worried that market declines will generate a needfor additional contributions to pension funds, says CharlesH. Salisbury Jr., vice president of T. Rowe Price AssociatesInc. in Baltimore. &quot;The last thing a treasurer wants to do isto go to the board of directors and say we have an unexpectedexpense here,&quot; he says.   After a rocky start, stock prices set records during thesummer, only to plunge in August with the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait, and then recover partially late in the year. &quot;FromBerlin to Baghdad, from the Wall to the fall, it was aterrifically volatile year,&quot; says Sandy Lincoln, president ofKemper Asset Management Co. in Chicago.   Market bright spots included U.S. and foreign bonds and avery few strong U.S. stock groups, such as health care andenergy. &quot;You were OK if you had anything in a vial or abarrel,&quot; says Mr. Lincoln. Short sellers -- who sell borrowedshares hoping to replace them later at a lower price --flourished despite a November hammering; asset allocatorseschewing stocks shone in the third quarter.   But international stocks, while still attracting a floodof money from big investors, produced big losses that morethan offset a fall in the dollar. Declining real estatevalues -- and the difficulty in measuring them -- became anincreasing headache for big investors, and that put thebrakes on new investments for properties.   In the U.S. stock market, bigger was better.Small-capitalization stocks fared poorly, despite buying byinvestors who expect the issues to rebound when the economyimproves. Growth stocks did better than analysts anticipatedin a declining market.   Money managers who emphasize so-called value stocks --those seemingly worth more than their current price and oftencarrying low price-earnings multiples -- were among thebiggest losers in 1990. The biggest pitfall: depressed bankstocks, which many value players thought were deals of alifetime. The investors loaded up on the bank issues,expecting a recovery that has yet to come.   &quot;They bought when these stocks were down, and they justwent down further,&quot; says David O'Donovan, a Chicago-basedconsultant with SEI Capital Resources. &quot;Value {investing} issupposed to protect on the downside, but that hasn't happenedthis time.&quot;   Beginning in July, institutions turned into net sellers ofstock on the New York Stock Exchange. Through October, theysold an average of 100,000 shares a day more than theybought, compared with net purchases averaging 2.8 millionshares a day in all of 1989, according to the SecuritiesIndustry Institute. In the over-the-counter market,institutional buying slowed, but it still outpaced sales in1990. On the American Stock Exchange, institutional netbuying rose 20% over 1989 levels in the first 10 months.   Despite the gloom over stocks, &quot;money managers haven'tbeen hurt that much by this downturn,&quot; according to NortonReamer, president of United Asset Management Corp., a Bostonholding company for 24 money management firms with assetstotaling $41 billion. Compared with investment banking, thebrokerage business and commercial banking, &quot;investmentmanagement is prosperous,&quot; he says.   Several financial institutions in Europe and Japan foundU.S. money management appealing enough to buy into thebusiness. Some cash-hungry U.S. banks and insurancecompanies, meanwhile, sold out their money management units.   Managers specializing in international investments did aboom business despite the poor showing for foreign stocks.&quot;Our clients' placement of assets internationally has beengreater this year&quot; than it was for the previous five years,says Ronald Peyton, president of pension consultants CallanAssociates Inc. in San Francisco.   After concentrating almost entirely on internationalstocks in the past, an increasing number of pension fundsadded foreign bonds in 1990. International bond managers suchas Global Fixed Income Advisors, a Newark, N.J., unit ofPrudential Insurance Co. of America, reported that assetsunder management grew 75% during the year.   Gains for global fixed-income accounts approached 20% in1990, according to Stephen C. Bartow, chief investmentofficer for Boston-based Putnam Cos.' internationalfixed-income group. About 60% of the foreign bond gainsthrough November came from currency gains and the remainderfrom market performance, he says.   A surge of interest in short selling accompanied the bearmarket, but relatively few adventurous institutions plungedinto shorting. &quot;The technique is still regarded with somesuspicion, just like futures were 10 years ago,&quot; says MichaelPhillips, president of consultant Frank Russell Co., inTacoma, Wash.   So-called alternative strategies attracted participants insuch areas as bankruptcy and workout funds, as well astimberland and oil and gas ventures. The collapse of thejunk-bond market hurt institutional holders, includingpension funds.   Investing in leveraged buy-outs dwindled but didn'tdisappear for LBO veterans. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.,moving to replenish its buy-out fund with $1 billion to $2billion in new capital, won pledges of $350 million each fromthe big state pension funds of Washington and Oregon, bothlongtime KKR clients.   KKR rival Forstmann Little andamp; Co. also made progressconvincing numerous big investors to ante up $1.5 billion innew debt financing for future deals. A successfulfund-raising would soften the blow of a failed effort earlierin the year by Forstmann Little to launch a fund to buysignificant stakes in debt-burdened companies.   Lingering LBO fears spawned sweeping state legislation toprotect companies incorporated in Pennsylvania andMassachusetts, passed over the objections of some biginstitutional investors. The Securities and ExchangeCommission's one-share, one-vote rule for proxy matters wasoverturned in a court ruling sought by the BusinessRoundtable.   Activist investors, led by several public-employee pensionfunds, proposed proxy resolutions focusing on such matters ascompensation paid to company executives and the independenceof corporate directors. &quot;There is going to be attention paidto the board of directors like never before,&quot; says Peg O'Haraof the Washington-based Investor Responsibility ResearchCenter.   Some officials in Washington welcomed an increased rolefor investors in the affairs of corporate America.   &quot;If America's corporations desire patient capital tocompete in today's global market, our corporate managers haveto listen to their shareholders' voices,&quot; Assistant LaborSecretary David George Ball told a group of company pensionfund officials in November. &quot;Patient investing requiresparticipation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
