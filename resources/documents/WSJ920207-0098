Seib   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/07/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A2</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><RE>IRAQ (IZ)MIDDLE EAST (ML)NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is accelerating itsdrive to push Saddam Hussein out of Iraq.   In recent weeks the administration has secretly sentCongress a new notification that it will use contingencyfunds available to the Central Intelligence Agency to pursuecovert activities aimed at ousting the Iraqi president. Theprogram would include provision of some military aid,intelligence officials said.</LP><TEXT>   The notification -- known as an intelligence finding -- issaid to be more explicit and broader than prior notificationsof actions aimed against Iraq that were provided by the WhiteHouse since the end of last year's Persian Gulf War.   Preliminary discussions have focused on making availablean estimated $20 million for the program, which goes beyondpreviously reported efforts to aim propoganda at Iraq andsupport political opposition groups. The significance of thenew notice is that it expands the latitude available to theadministration and serves to give notice to Congress in caseovert action is required later in response to a coup attemptby anti-Saddam forces.   At the same time, officials said, Robert Gates, directorof the CIA, is traveling in the Middle East on an inauguraltour of the region in which he is discussing efforts to oustthe Iraqi president with America's Arab allies in the region.   The new moves against Iraq are the result of a weeklongpolicy review by the Bush administration prompted by signsthat increasing internal ferment in Iraq may be making SaddamHussein vulnerable. But officials also said that the newplans, while stepping up the pace of efforts to force achange in Iraq, don't reflect a radical shift in the Americanapproach.   In particular, officials said the U.S. remains leery ofcovertly arming Shiite and Kurdish rebels active in the southand north of Iraq, respectively. Administration officialsthink those rebels could set off a sectarian war that mightrip apart Iraq without succeeding in pushing Saddam Husseinout of power in Baghdad.   Instead, U.S. officials think a successful effort to oustSaddam Hussein must instead originate within the Sunni Muslimminority that runs Iraq's government, army and ruling Baathparty. In particular, the U.S. hopes to encourage an armycoup, and there are exiled Sunni army officers in SaudiArabia and elsewhere who would like covert aid in theirefforts to unseat Saddam Hussein.</TEXT></DOC>
