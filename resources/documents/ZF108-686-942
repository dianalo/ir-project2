Not all piracy is the result of criminalintent: much software is still placed in the public domain ordistributed as 'shareware' and paid for on an honor system.andP;  Userswho tried to write their own software with crude tools gained asense of its value and were more willing to pay for it.andP;  Bundlingsoftware with hardware is one way of discouraging piracy; offering'amnesty' for offenders who come forward and pay is another.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software PublishersSoftware PiracyTrendsManagement of EDP.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>People don't really believe that they have to pay for their PC software.andO;They don't really think that copying software is wrong, or at least no moreso than speeding or going overtime on a parking meter: annoying if you'recaught, but not a moral offense.andM;In earlier days, true hackers treated a piece of software as either avaluable work to be purchased, or (more often) as a favor to the usercommunity, to be returned in the form of one's own efforts.andM;Today, however, most PCs are used as consumer products or office equipment.andO;And despite the trade press' love affair with end-user programming, few userswill ever write a line of code for the benefit of anyone else.andP;  But theythink that software is free, or that its price is at most an &quot;honesty tax.&quot;andM;I've seen it in homes, where the XT clone full of &quot;friendly&quot; copies hasbecome an American institution.andP;  I've seen it in offices, where systems comeout of the box with bootleg software already installed.andP;  I've heard it atparties, where &quot;I don't have the manuals, but .andP;  .  .&quot; opens moreconversations than &quot;What's your sign?&quot;andM;This behavior is not always fueled by criminal intent.andP;  Many people aresincerely confused.andP;  There's public domain software, which you copy and usewithout fee; shareware, which you copy for others but pay for if you use ityourself; crippleware, which is a limited version of a program with theoption to pay for a complete one; and finally, retail software, which you buyif you don't know someone who can make a free copy for you.andP;  Levity aside,isn't that the world of software as seen by the typical PC user?andP;  And, forthat matter, by too many business owners as well?andM;It used to be that users got their sense of software value the hard way, bytrying to write their own.andP;  When I got my first workplace PC in early '83, Ispent three months writing &quot;spreadsheets&quot; with FOR .andP;  .  .  NEXT loops andDATA statements in BASIC.andP;  Then we got Lotus 1-2-3; it was a transcendingexperience.andP;  I immediately bought a copy for home as well, because I knewthat this product would make our PC complete.andP;  Release 1A is alive and welland doing my family's chores.andP;  But we can't send every new PC user throughsoftware boot camp to develop that same perspective.andM;Is there a practical way to change the climate that fosters piracy?andP;  Shouldhardware vendors take a stand?andP;  Should they ask customers what they plan todo with their systems, and sell machines only with appropriate software?andM;Unfortunately, that would be illegal restraint of trade; customers must befree to buy products wherever they can get the best terms.andP;  But there wouldbe a lot less piracy if products such as Microsoft Works came bundled,legally, with more PCs.andM;Another tack is to offer amnesty, where pirates can turn in bootleg copies ofsoftware and get licensed versions for a fraction of the normal fee.andP;  But ithas to be a one-shot deal, or it will lose all credibility.andP;  An even worseproblem with this strategy is that legitimate licensees, who paid full price,will resent being made to feel like suckers.andM;What about scaring the pirates to death, as in the current ads about folkslosing their jobs over illegal copies?andP;  Well, for years they tried scaretactics with cigarettes, and it didn't work.andP;  Smoking didn't lose out tocommon sense; it lost to the outrage of non-smokers who decided they'd hadenough.andP;  And there's no software equivalent of second-hand smoke.andP;  The damageis too hard to see.andM;Maybe software registration could become a status thing: the SoftwarePublishers Association could give you a plaque with hooks on it; every pieceof software you buy could have a little plaque of its own, including itsserial number, hanging in a growing chain of registrations.andP;  (On thepractical side, this could also be a handy display of phone and serialnumbers for vendor support.) But this wouldn't help the legions of laptopusers.andP;  Maybe we could give them charm bracelets.andM;Somehow, vendors have to justify the notion that they are licensing, notselling, software.andP;  You can't sell what people think is free.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
