Mr. Bounpane appeared before reporters yesterday to unveilrevised estimates of the 1990 census undercount. As did anearlier estimate of the undercount, the new findings, basedon a post-enumeration survey conducted in selected areasafter the 1990 census, showed a 2% undercount.</LP><TEXT>   But the refined estimates suggest a slightly differentundercount for certain states. As a result, they could affectallocation of federal aid and congressional reapportionment-- if the Commerce Department and Congress choose to alterthe population tally. That's considered unlikely, though.   The new estimates would give California and Arizona, whichunder the unadjusted census would gain seven and onecongressional seats, respectively, one additional seat each,according to Election Data Services, a Democratic politicalconsulting concern specializing in redistricting. The firmsaid Pennsylvania, which is set to lose one seat, would losetwo under the revised count and Wisconsin, which was notpreviously set to gain or lose, would lose one seat. TheDemocratic firm's estimates were seconded by the NationalRepublican Congressional Committee.   Under a 1989 court order brought by several cities,Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher must decide by mid-Julywhether to adjust the 1990 count based on thepost-enumeration survey. Congress would have the final say asto whether the revised numbers would affect reapportionment.   &quot;My confidence in the post-enumeration survey continues togrow,&quot; said Rep. Tom Sawyer (D, Ohio), who heads the Housecensus and population subcommittee and has been sharplycritical of the 1990 census. But Mr. Bounpane indicated thatthe Census Bureau hasn't yet resolved certain naggingquestions about the quality of the post-enumeration surveyitself.</TEXT></DOC>
