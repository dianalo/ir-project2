The examiner, David I. Shapiro, told a congressional hearingThursday that a union-backed takeover plan to restore the airline tofull operations with former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci asinterim head is not viable.   Eastern owner Frank Lorenzo and the court previously rejected theplan, but the House Public Works and Transportation aviationsubcommittee gave it another airing in the committee's effort tofind a way to restore Eastern as a major carrier.   Carlucci told the panel that turning the airline over to Chicagobusinessman Joseph Ritchie and Eastern unions is the only way tosave the airline as a major carrier. Ritchie had asked Carlucci totemporarily head the airline if the sale is approved.   At the same hearing, Eastern reiterated plans to resume more ofits flights this Sunday and work up to 50 percent of its pre-strikeschedule by August. The airline has been operating only a fewflights since March when a Machinists strike, supported by pilotsand flight attendants, led it to file for reorganization underfederal bankruptcy laws.   Shapiro, who represents and advises the federal bankruptcy courtin New York, told the subcommittee that major Eastern assets must besold to ``reduce the enormous interest burden on the company.''   The airline has debts totalling $3.6 billion.   ``These past months have left me with the reluctant but firmconviction that only two practical alternative remain in thiscase,'' said Shapiro. ``The first is a reorganization plan premisedon a smaller Eastern Airlines; the second is liquidation.''   Shapiro said Ritchie's plan included no firm offer to Lorenzo'sTexas Air in payment for the airline and had no operational planthat would keep the airline flying. He said Ritchie had failed in adozen meetings with court officials to provide a confidential lettershowing he had financial backing for his plan.   ``Ritchie's plan flunked in operational viability and it flunkedin financial viability and is still flunking,'' Shapiro said.   Shapiro said he still sees a ``ray of hope'' in talks he isholding with striking unions, trying to convince them to accept ascaled-down airline and return to work.   The unions, however, repeated that they will not work forLorenzo, head of Texas Air, which owns Eastern and nonunionContinental Airlines.   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, saidLorenzo was maneuvering to sell off Eastern's assets and close itdown. Eastern claims assets of $6 billion, but potential purchaserssay it's worth a couple of billion dollars less.   Phil Bakes, Eastern president, said the airline's training ofpilots and preparations to increase flights show Lorenzo does notplan to sell off any more than the $1.8 billion in assets previouslyannounced.   He said Eastern is losing $1.7 million a day because of thestrike but plans to build itself up to 70 percent of its previouslevel.   Carlucci, defense secretary in the latter part of the Reaganadministration, told the panel he is still willing to act as aninterim chief executive of the airline if Ritchie's offer isaccepted.   ``This approach is the only one that has a chance of restoringEastern to its once proud status,'' he said.   Ritchie, president of Chicago Research andamp; Trading Group, said hisplan calls for $100 million in new money from his own funds, theunions and other investors and $200 million or more in new financing.</TEXT></DOC>
