In the year-earlier period, the maker of gear-production equipment and industrial products had net income of $326,000, or six cents a share.    Third-quarter sales dipped 21% to $43.3 million from $54.8 million.    Gleason acknowledged that the quarter loss was larger than expected. It said sales at its Gleason Works Division were hurt by delays in obtaining customers' letters of credit and import licenses and in developing software for machines scheduled for delivery during the quarter.    In the Components Group, sales about matched year-earlier receipts. But they didn't meet expectations, especially since the company had hired additional employees and boosted capital spending in anticipation of higher volume. Consequently, operating results were hurt. The company also said its Torsen differential product line continued to lose money because of the cost of prototype test programs and of decreased sales to foreign customers.    For the first nine months, Gleason had a net loss of $8 million, compared with year-ago net of $2.5 million, or 43 cents a share, which included a gain of $3 million from an accounting change. Nine-month revenue was $147.2 million, down 12% from $166.5 million a year ago.    James S. Gleason, chairman and president, said he expects &quot;significantly improved results&quot; in the fourth quarter, although he added that some factors which hurt third-period results have carried over into the quarter. In the 1987 fourth period, Gleason had a loss of $3.8 million on sales of $62.9 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gleason closed at $11.625 a share, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
