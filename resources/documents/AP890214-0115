U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh may not file a series of affidavits in ``bits andpieces'' during North's trial.   Gesell said he was inclined to wait until the Supreme Court ruleson the Justice Department request for a stay of the trial. The fullcourt meets privately Friday. The department has sought to delay thetrial until appellate judges can review procedures to protectnational security.   The agreement on how to handle the classified material was struckover the weekend between Thornburgh and the independent counsel.Gesell said it was not satisfactory.   ``I find no basis for giving him (Thornburgh and the JusticeDepartment) a seat at counsel table or the right to intervene by wayof bits and pieces of affidavits whenever the going gets tough,''said Gesell.   He also said he would consider defense objections to an admissionproposed by the government that the Reagan administration gave thirdcountries ``quid quo pro'' inducements to help arm the Nicaraguanrebels when U.S. assistance was banned by Congress.   The judge said he ``had a sense that the quid may beunderplayed'' in the prosecution's proposed description of thearrangements that the defense said were approved by PresidentReagan, who ordered top officials to keep them secret.   Gesell said he would convene a hearing on Wednesday to considerdefense proposals to change the statement about the third-countrycontributions.   In a filing today, North's lawyers said the inducement offered toCentral American nations ``in return for their military support forthe Resistance (Contras) was, in part, CIA covert support.''   ``If the court requires prior notice of this covert support, itwill effectively require prior notice before any exploration of quidpro quo arrangements that are central to this case,'' North'slawyers said.   Gesell already has thrown out the major charges against Northbecause of Justice Department objections to disclosure of certainclassified information.   North attorney Brendan Sullivan is attempting to introduceevidence about the Reagan administration's secret efforts to aid theContras in his defense of North, who is charged with covering up theIran-Contra affair by shredding evidence and lying to Congress.   Sullivan said Monday that Reagan and other top administrationofficials ``participated personally and directly in quid pro quo andother arrangements with Central American and other third countriesas a means of obtaining military assistance'' for the Contras afterCongress banned U.S. aid.   The officials also ``established a policy that those arrangementswould not be disclosed outside a limited group of Executive Branchofficials,'' Sullivan said in a court filing.   Reagan lawyer Theodore Olson declined to comment on Sullivan'sassertions.   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is prosecutingNorth, said in a court filing that he is willing to agree at trialto a ``candid admission ... with respect to quid pro quoarrangements'' under which the Reagan administration steered favorsto nations aiding the Contras.   But Sullivan said a proposed stipulation on the issue by Walsh``is utterly inadequate'' because it doesn't acknowledge that Reaganand other top officials participated in the arrangements anddisclosed them to no one outside a limited group of officials.   ``At the heart of this case,'' said Sullivan, ``are the quid proquo and other third-country arrangements with which the Reaganadministration obtained military support for the Resistance duringthe so-called Boland Amendments.'' That was the period from October1984 to October 1986 when Congress banned military aid to theContras.   Sullivan disclosed that Gesell addressed the possible relevanceof the information to North's case in a closed hearing lastWednesday.   According to Sullivan's filing, Gesell said it was possible that``North was between a rock and a hard place. He's being told on thetop side not to tell anybody and he's being asked a lot of questionsabout it on the bottom side.''   ``And some of those instructions came from people who havemilitary authority over him as well as presidential authority overhim and I have ruled that he should be entitled to have the jury tosee the circumstances under which he acted.''   The allegations concerning Reagan are part of the dispute overthe planned use of classified documents at North's trial, on whichGesell is to hold a hearing today.   The Justice Department wants more stringent limits placed onclassified material that North can use at trial, claiming thatnational security could be hurt by public disclosures. North'slawyers oppose the additional controls and say classified materialcan prove North's innocence.   Sullivan said the government wants to omit any reference to thedirect participation in third-country arrangements by Reagan, CIADirector William Casey, national security adviser Robert McFarlane,Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary of Defense CasparWeinberger and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, JohnVessey.   Reagan's involvement in third-country contributions for theContras was publicized in some detail in the 1987 Iran-Contrahearings. But his alleged involvement in providing favors and incovering up the arrangements is new.   An instance of quid pro quo efforts involving North surfaced inthe Iran-Contra congressional hearings in 1987. North wantedfalsified documents from Central American countries to concealshipments going to the Contras.   On March 5, 1985, he proposed that Guatemala be rewarded for itsassistance in providing false end-user certificates so that morethan 98,000 pounds of East European munitions could be made bychartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to a Central Americancountry for the Contras.   End-user certificates are documents certifying that the arms arefor the exclusive use of the country to which they are being sent.The Contras could not issue such certificates because they were nota recognized government.   In a memo to then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane,North suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and Vesseybe asked to grant Guatemala additional security assistance.   The real purpose of the memo, said North, was to ``find a way bywhich we can compensate'' Guatemala ``for the extraordinaryassistance they are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.''   North said he was attaching ``end-user certificates'' whichGuatemala ``provided for the purchase of nearly $8M worth ofmunitions to be delivered'' to the Contras.   Sullivan also said he wants to cross-examine McFarlane about amessage he wrote on Nov. 8, 1986, saying: ``I hope to daylights thatsomeone has been purging .... files on this episode.''   Sullivan said that under the government's proposed agreement onthe use of classified information, the use of this computer messageis now in doubt.   North is charged, among other things, with shredding documentsthat month to conceal the Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
