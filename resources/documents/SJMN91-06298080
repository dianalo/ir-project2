One can findbooks critical of any country and its people and indeed find as many bookspraiseworthy of the same country and the same people.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PERIOD OF TRANSITION IS DIFFICULT FOR KOREA  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     We could not help but wonder whether all the books she had read on thesubject were written by &quot;colonial&quot; Japanese because it was said in the articlethat she had lived and worked in Tokyo.;   Bachman also mentions &quot;a Confucianbelief that the man who backs down and compromises shows his weakness.&quot; Doesshe have any idea what the Confucian belief is all about? The main message ofthe Confucian philosophy is about maintaining harmony in human relationships.;  Korea and the Korean people are experiencing a period of transition.Thirty-six years of Japanese occupation and Korean Civil War, followed bysuccessive totalitarian governments, have destroyed many of its social valuesand high standards of conduct inherited from the Confucian teachings.;   Koreais also going through a difficult transitional period due to its recenteconomic growth unprecedented elsewhere. Korea's social values have not caughtup with the rapid advancement in the national economy and technology. Theviolent student demonstrations against the government, often resulting inhuman fatalities, and the rudeness of the people in service industries (whichin itself may be the manifestation of the people's frustration over the unjustdistribution of wealth between haves and have nots), are examples of the manysocial problems the country is facing today.;   It is true that Americanstraveling in Korea these days more often than not encounter rudeness andstrong anti-American sentiment -- an unfortunate byproduct created bypoliticians of both countries. It is very likely that Bachman had indeedexperienced a series of unpleasant incidents as described in her article.;  What disturbed us the most about her article, however, was not whether theunpleasant incidents were true or not, but the fact that a supposedly seasonedwriter would allow her personal reactions to these isolated experiences toinfluence a very important commentary on a country of over 40 million peopleand over 4,000 years of history. We could not help but feel that hercharacterization of the Korean people was comparable to a foreign reportercharacterizing the American people as rude and uncivilized based on his or herunpleasant experience with a bad New York cab driver.;   -- Jeong-Bin andMee-Joo Kim; Los Altos  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911024  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  432  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 24, 199100298080,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
