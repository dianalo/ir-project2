The Cincinnati-based grocery chain's first-quarter resultscompared with an after-tax profit of $40.3 million, or 48 cents ashare, in the first quarter of 1988.   Kroger said it recorded the first-quarter loss despite strongsales during the period. Revenue totaled $4.5 billion, up from $4.3billion in the comparable 1988 quarter.   Kroger launched a $4.6 billion restructuring last fall to fendoff takeover threats from two interested parties. The restructuringhas included sales of stores and food processing plants and thelayoff of 300 headquarters employees.   Kroger officials said operating cash flow from units not beingsold by the company totaled $192.4 million for the quarter, up 27.3percent from $151.2 million in the year-ago first quarter.   Lyle Everingham, Kroger's chairman and chief executive officer,said the company helped its first-quarter results with aggressivemarketing programs and by holding down operating costs.   Kroger announced that a $250 million divestiture loan it tookout as part of its restructuring will be substantially repaidwithin 45 days upon completion of the previously announced sale ofKroger's Price Savers wholesale stores unit.   The company also said it has hired Bankers Trust Co. to serve asagent in arranging long-term financing of Kroger's real estateholdings. Proceeds from those transactions are projected to exceed$500 million, which Kroger said it will use to further reduce a$2.7 billion loan. That loan has already been reduced to $2.4billion, Kroger officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
