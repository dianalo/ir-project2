Miller, assistant vice president and executive director ofuniversity information systems at Boston University.andM;Several agencies want to move toward unattended operations but feel limitedin their ability to proceed, Farber said.andP;  Technical personnel are in highdemand, so agencies have to find the best way to use the staffs they have.andM;If managers are willing to put in the effort, time and commitment, they mayfind moving to unattended operations is no worse then getting through otherkinds of red tape, said Rosemary LaChance, co-founder of Farber/LaChance.andM;Bringing up unattended operations at a remote site is a safe way for anagency to start because it can alleviate some of the fears of such anoperation, Farber said.andM;The government has been exploring unattended operations because of budgetaryrestraints that force agencies to pay closer attention to how they usetechnology, LaChance said.andM;A large federal agency site in Maryland that Farber would not identify is inthe first phase of a phase-three unattended operations project.andM;The first phase calls for unattended operations from 4 a.m.andP;  to 6 a.m.andO;During the last phase, the midnight to 6 a.m.andP;  shift will be unattended, hesaid.andM;The hub of automation is the combination of an advanced scheduling system anda product control system that can trap and reroute problems, Farber said.andO;Such a system eliminated the need for a console management system that waitsfor a problem to occur, he said.andM;Farber emphasized that the agency's data center hardware and software were nodifferent from what other agencies have.andM;Robotics, which will speed up the move to unattended operations, has gainedcredibility in the last year and large vendors, such as Memorex and IBM Corp.andO;&quot;have changed their tune and are getting intoit,&quot; Farber said.andM;Automated console management is an important step toward automated operationsand significantly decreases human intervention, but it is not the solutionfor unattended operations, Farber said.andM;&quot;If you think data processing is like it used to be, it is time to wake upand get in step,&quot; Farber said.andP;  Operations personnel used to try to &quot;protectthe users from themselves,&quot; but users now are computer literate and have thepower with their desktop machines to do what a data center used to have to dofor them, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
