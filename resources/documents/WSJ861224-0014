The bid, made Monday by Chas. P. Young Co., has an estimated value of $305 million. Pandick's board already has approved an earlier $25.50-a-share leveraged buyout proposal by some Pandick executives.    Both Pandick and Young are financial printers. Service Resources provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies.    Pandick also said its chairman, Edward G. Green, who isn't part of the management group that made the leveraged buyout offer, hasn't engaged in any discussions with Service Resources about its proposal. As previously reported, Service Resources said it planned to ask Mr. Green to head the combined financial printing operation that would be created in the acquisition.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
