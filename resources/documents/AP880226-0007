TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli analysts say riots in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip began spontaneously 11 weeks ago, but the PLOand Islamic groups are playing an increasing role in the unrest.   President Reagan said at a news conference Wednesday that``terrorists'' and ``outsiders'' were behind much of the violence.   Yasser Arafat, chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization,said in an interview with Swedish television earlier this monththat he planned and controlled the Palestinian uprising.   All indications point to a spontaneous beginning of riots Dec.8, when an army truck killed four Palestinians outside the Jabaliyarefugee camp in the Gaza Strip.   The accident occurred the day after an Israeli was fatallystabbed in Gaza City, and rumors swept the camp that the truck hitthe Arabs on purpose.   Israel's U.N. Ambassador Benyamin Netanyahu told reporters therumor was helped along by a PLO broadcast on Baghdad radio.   Jabaliya residents held an overnight march and the firstcasualties were recorded Dec. 9: two Arabs killed and 18 wounded byIsraeli soldiers.   Journalists on the scene discover that many clashes are startedby such local incidents as army arrest raids or the funerals ofArabs shot during protests.   Ohers begin after announcements from the loudspeakers ofmosques, usually untrue, that say Jewish settlers are headed forvillages or towns on vigilante rampages.   Brig. Gen. Arieh Shalev, military governor of the West Bank in1974-76, said control of the protests was split among severalgroups: Arafat's mainstream PLO, Syrian-backed Palestinian groupsand local Islamic fundamentalist organizations.   They use leaflets, radio broadcasts from Iraq and Syria, andorders relayed by telephone to activists in the West Bank and Gaza,he said in an interview.   Shalev said the PLO had strong influence as a symbol but itsorganizational structure was weak in the territories, partlybecause of an army crackdown that has jailed nearly 2,000 activistssince December.   As a result, he said, local groups would follow PLO directivesonly if they were deemed reasonable.   ``If they ordered people to stop working at jobs in Israelaltogether, people would not pay attention because they have noalternative,'' the general said.   Reporters sometimes have seen highly organized local responsesby Palestinians.   At Gaza City's Shifa hospital in December, community leaders metin the director's office to plan strategy while youths piled upstones in the courtyard. Demonstrators handed reporters printedlists of grievances.   In Jerusalem, journalists saw Arab medical teams arrive fromneighboring areas as youths set up makeshift barricades andprepared to attack soldiers with stones.   Amnon Linn, chairman of a parliamentary subcommittee on the WestBank and Gaza Strip, said 80 percent of the riots now result fromPLO leaflets.   ``They call on people to revolt and kill anyone who makes anattempt to negotiate with Israel or has any relations with Israeliauthorities,'' said Linn, former head of the Labor Party's Arabdepartment.   Nahum Barnea, editor of the leftist magazine Koteret Rashit,said: ``The PLO was suprised by the start of the riots. It was notinitiated by the PLO.''   Barnea said in an interview the PLO stepped in later withdirectives for commercial strikes and boycotts.   He said PLO influence sometimes helped restrain young Arabs fromescalating the violence with knives, guns and bombs, so ``in a wayit is a positive sign. The PLO has never before had the power tocontrol events.''   Col. Yoni, an Israeli commander in the West Bank whose full namecould not be used in keeping with army regulations, told a reporterlast week: ``Most of the disturbances are now deliberate attacks onsoldiers.''   The army has reported attacks in the past week that indicatePalestinians may be moving up from stones to knives and otherdeadly weaspons.   A military vehicle was ambushed Tuesday night in the Gaza Stripby Arabs who exploded a roadside bomb and opened fire with guns. Noone was hurt.</TEXT></DOC>
