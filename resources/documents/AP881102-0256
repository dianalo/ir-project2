Bush was battling not only Dukakis, but a Reagan administrationrecord that environmental groups contend was often inimical to thecauses of clean air, land and water.   But the vice president proclaimed himself an environmentalist andtook the battle to Boston Harbor, blaming the Massachusetts governorfor the squalid state of the harbor.   Dukakis ridiculed Bush's ``election-year conversion'' and saidthat Boston Harbor has ``been polluted for hundreds of years, andI'm very proud to be the governor who's cleaning it up ... no thanksto Vice President Bush and the administration he is part of.''   Dukakis won the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters,which gave him a grade of B versus a D-plus for Bush.   Some environmentalists said Dukakis' record was not unspotted,but it was a lot cleaner than that of the Reagan-Bush administration.   ``Boston Harbor is not Michael Dukakis' shining moment,'' saidJeff Webb, a Friends of the Earth lobbyist. ``But that's one issuein one state. What about eight years of neglect?''   Arlene O'Donnell of the Massachusetts Audobon Society saidDukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental issues,although ``he still tends, on bulldozer-vs.-trees kind of things, totake the business side.''   Bush, citing the drought, forest fires and medical wastes thatwashed up on beaches, called 1988 ``the year Earth spoke back.'' Hecalled for an international conference next year to discuss globalwarming and ozone depletion.   Bush said, ``In the past few years, we have not done enough toprotect the environment. I will do more.''   Bush claimed he was always an environmentalist, and said therehas been a long tradition of support for the environment within theGOP ``from Abraham Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Richard Nixon.''   But it was the record of another Republican president, RonaldReagan, that gave environmentalists pause.   Dukakis charged Bush was ``a charter member of the environmentalwrecking crew'' of former Interior Secretary James Watt and othercontroversial Reagan administration appointees.   Environmentalists faulted Reagan for his handling of theSuperfund to clean up toxic waste, for not acting to curb acid rainand for vetoing a $20 billion authorization to clean up U.S.waterways.   Environmentalists say it was Bush's de-regulation task force thatenabled the Office of Management and Budget to secure veto powerover environmental and other regulations. Dukakis has promised torevoke the Reagan executive order that allows that.   Bush has backed a goal of ``no net loss of wetlands.'' Hesupported a ban on ocean dumping of sludge, which Congress now hasordered.   Dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands and restoring``part of the vast endowment of wetlands that America has lost.''But his administration approved filling a swamp for a shoppingcenter near Attleboro, a development that the Reagan EnvironmentalProtection Agency went to court to block.   As governor, Dukakis fought to block licensing of the stillbornSeabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire and to bar oil drilling inthe Georges Bank off the New England coast. As president, hepromises to block drilling off the Northern California coast and theFlorida Keys.   Bush, a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry, last springendorsed a moratorium on drilling in ``many'' sensitive areas offthe California coast.   On nuclear power, Dukakis opposes construction of new commercialreactors until a new, safer design is developed and ways are foundto treat and dispose of nuclear waste.   Bush says, ``I believe nuclear power must be a part of our energymix,'' and says he will ``insist on the highest safety standards.''   On acid rain, Bush promises to ask Congress to cut millions oftons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2,000 and to reducenitrogen oxide emissions.   Dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law toforce industrial states ``that are major contributors to the acidrain problem to find solutions within three years.''   Both favor ``clean coal'' research to tap the nation's abundantsupply of fossil fuel.   Both support a global ban on chlorofluorocarbons, which aredestroying the ozone layer.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
