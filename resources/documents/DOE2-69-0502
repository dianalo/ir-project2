The variants are distinguished by theratios of coal, oil, and natural gas quantities in use. Using a carboncycle model, the partial pressure of CO{sub 2} in the atmosphere is calculatedfor all five variants. The spread of predicted concentrations for thefive scenarios, accounting for uncertainties in the values of model parameters,is less than that based on data from the 1985 international conferenceat Villach, Austria. 16 references.</TEXT></DOC>
