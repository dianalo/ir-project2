Meanwhile, stocks rose in London and fell in Frankfurt.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei index dropped 352.41 points to close at 27548.58, its lowest level in two weeks. Volume on the first section was estimated at a moderate one billion shares, unchanged from Monday's estimated figure. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section dropped 28.22, to 2123.64.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were weaker. The Nikkei index was down 75.99 points to 27472.59.    In the bond market Tuesday, the benchmark No. 105 issue due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.17%, up 0.075 percentage point, representing a price of 98.93, off 0.47.    Stocks were buffeted throughout the day by reports about the emperor's condition that at times were reassuring and at times indicated the monarch's condition was critical.    Both markets were weakened by a drop in New York's financial markets overnight and by selling ahead of the September fiscal year end of some Japanese financial institutions.    But the dominant factor in the market appeared to be uncertainty surrounding the 87-year-old emperor's condition. A trickle of news from the Imperial Palace suggested that the health of the emperor, who has occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1926, deteriorated sharply over the past few days.    Although the emperor has no formal responsibilities in the government, observers said his demise could affect Japan's economy. If the nation were to go into mourning and declare holiday observances, industrial output probably would decline. In addition, analysts said, the Diet, Japan's parliament, might not be able to finish debate on a tax reform plan this year, since the emperor's death would impose a heavy burden of ceremonial tasks.    &quot;That could create the biggest problem,&quot; said Kazuhisa Okamoto, chief strategist at Nikko Securities Co.    Anticipating the unease the emperor's death would cause, investors trimmed positions in the stock market, selling heavily capitalized stocks, such as steel and shipbuilding companies, which have been popular recently.    Many investors shifted their money into stock in paper and printing companies, which will have a crush of business when the emperor dies. Money, calendars and many corporate documents in Japan would have to be reprinted if Hirohito dies and is succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Akihito.    Buying interest in paper shares picked up overnight in London, where investors started snapping up equity-warrants giving them the right to purchase the stocks. Activity then picked up in Tokyo, and grew so heavy that the Ministry of Finance was rumored to have asked securities firms to slow the pace of orders.    Honshu Paper surged 100 yen to 928 yen ($6.95) on volume of 33.4 million shares, while Jujo Paper was up 65 to 1,050 on volume of 20.1 million, and Mitsubishi Paper Mills rose 50 to 1,170 on volume of 21.4 million.    While most traders said that Tokyo stock trading probably won't be interrupted after the emperor's death, as it was the last time an emperor died on the throne in 1920, some said that the outside chance that the exchange may shut down was enough to encourage some investors to clear some of their positions.    The Tokyo Stock Exchange said a decision on whether or not to suspend trading if the emperor dies would be made only after the monarch's death is announced.    London share prices finished firmer in calm trading, supported by news of slower than expected growth in U.K. bank lending during August.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 11.3 points at 1429.9. Volume remained light, with just 309.2 million shares changing hands, compared with 326.7 million Monday. The 100-share index closed 12.2 points higher at 1772.1.    The U.K. bank lending figures released earlier in the day helped allay some concern that Britain's interest rates might have to move higher over the short term in response to inflationary pressures.    The data showed that M-4 bank lending, the most widely watched indication of domestic lending, rose #5.8 billion ($9.73 billion) in August, less than July's #9.2 billion rise, and less than the #7 billion to #10 billion rise expected by the market.    &quot;It's beginning to look as if {U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel} Lawson's actions earlier this summer in heaving interest rates higher are beginning to have some effect,&quot; one dealer said.    Several dealers said the market's gaze now has shifted to next Tuesday's U.K. balance of payments data for August.    Lonrho shares closed up 21 pence at 290 pence ($4.85) as a heavy 12 million shares changed hands. The company disclosed late in the day that New York arbitrager Asher B. Edelman and associate groups have purchased a 3.8% holding.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed broadly lower in relatively calm trading amid widespread profit-taking on the market's recent gains.    But the sell-off was more moderate than some analysts had feared, and most stock prices recovered during the session from their depressed opening levels, they said.    &quot;The opening quotes were the weakest -- from then on the market livened up,&quot; one broker on the Frankfurt exchange said. He predicted a continuation of the rally this week.    Other market operators cited the drop in trading volume from Monday, which showed little selling pressure, as a sign that the upward trend is still intact.    In the automobile sector, Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 4 marks to 505 ($270) and Daimler-Benz fell 3.7 to 700.5. Volkswagen, which Monday launched a three-currency bond issue with equity warrants, dropped 3.9 to 259.3.    Among banks, Dresdner Bank dropped 3.5 to 289.5. The bank rose sharply Monday on rumors that insurer Allianz is buying a stake in it. Deutsche Bank fell 3 marks to 515, and Commerzbank fell 1.5 to 243.5.    Elsewhere, shares closed mostly lower in Paris and Zurich, but the Brussels bull market continued. Prices closed mixed in Milan and Amsterdam.    Share prices closed lower in Seoul, Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore and Wellington and were higher in Sydney. The Taipei market rose to a record.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                     % This                               Sep 19     Sep 16      Year    U.S. .......................248.0      249.5    +  8.1    Britain ................... 531.3      532.6    +  3.0    Canada .................... 352.8      353.6    +  0.6    Japan .................... 1279.4     1278.0    + 25.1    France .................... 381.1      380.5    + 32.1    Germany ................... 193.9      191.5    + 23.9    Hong Kong ................ 1801.9     1807.3    +  9.6    Switzerland ............... 159.8      158.1    + 13.6    Australia ................. 306.3      310.1    + 18.2    World index ............... 441.7      441.6    +  8.3</TEXT></DOC>
