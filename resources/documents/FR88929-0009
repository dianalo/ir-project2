Instabilities have occurred inthe pitch axis resulting in stop-to-stop excursions of the flight controls.These were determined to be the result of insufficient stiffness of thetrim tab. This condition could lead to loss of control or structural failure.The actions described in this AD will preclude this structural failureor loss of control.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2><T3>Effective Date:</T3> October 27, 1988.<T3>Compliance: </T3>As described in the body of the AD.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Partenavia Costruzione Aeronautiche, S.p.A, ServiceBulletin No. 73, Revision 1, dated July 11, 1988, applicable to this ADmay be obtained from Partenavia Costruzione Aeronautiche, S.p.A., 80026Casoria (NA) Via G.

The manufacturer has determined that these occurrences werecaused by insufficient stiffness of the trim tab structure. Flexibilityin the trim tab or pitch control surface system can alter the aerodynamiccharacteristics of the control surface resulting in an unstable aerodynamiccondition. As a result, Partenavia has issued Service Bulletin Number 73,Revision 1, dated July 11, 1988, to repair and modify the stabilator, andstabilator trim tabs. The FAA has reviewed the action surrounding thiscondition and the remedial measures taken by the manufacturer and the RAIand has concluded that the modification or replacement of the stabilator,and stabilator trim tabs will prevent pitch instability induced by trimtab flexibility.The Registro Aeronautico Italiano (RAI) has also issued RAI telegraphicAD No. 88-10 mandating compliance with the actions of the Partenavia ServiceBulletin. On airplanes operated under Italian registration, this actionhas the same effect as an AD on airplanes certificated for operation inthe United States. The FAA relies upon the certification of RAI combinedwith FAA review of pertinent documentation in finding compliance of thedesign of these airplanes with the applicable United States airworthinessrequirements and the airworthiness and conformity of products of this designcertificated for operation in the United States.The FAA has examined the available information related to the issuanceof Partenavia Costruzione Aeronautiche, S.p.A., Service Bulletin No. 73,Revision 1, dated July 11, 1988, and the mandatory classification of thisService Bulletin by the RAI. Based on the foregoing, the FAA has determinedthat the condition described herein is an unsafe condition that may existor develop on other products of the same type design certificated for operationin the United States.Therefore, an AD is being issued requiring inspection and modification,or replacement of the stabilator and stabilator trim tabs on certain PartenaviaCostruzione Aeronautiche S.p.A., P 68 series airplanes. Because an emergencycondition exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impractical andcontrary to the public interest, and good cause exists for making thisamendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not major under Section 8 of Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a signficant regulation, a final regulatory evaluation or analysis,as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise,an evaluation is not required). A copy of it, when filed, may be obtainedby contacting the Rules Docket under the caption ``<T2>Addresses</T2>'' at the location identified.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe FAR as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
