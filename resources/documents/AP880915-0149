The center, normally open for visitors every day but Christmas,was closed at noon. All but a core group of employees were allowedto go home and told they didn't have to come back until Monday,spokesman James Hartsfield said.   If the hurricane causes little or no damage at the space center,Hartsfield said, it would probably have no affect on the expectedlaunch of the first post-Challenger flight at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,later this month.   There are more than 9,000 workers at the space center, includinggovernment employees and people who work for private companies thathave contracts with the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.   NASA officials wanted to allow employees time to secure theirhomes, get supplies or leave the area if they chose to do sobecause of the threat Gilbert posed to the Texas coast. The spacecenter is about 25 miles from the coast.   A core group will remain throughout the weekend at MissionControl, the strongest building at the center and the place whereshuttle missions are controlled, Hartsfield said. Mission Controlhas concrete walls and no windows.   ``If the storm hurts that, we're really in trouble,'' he said.   Past storms have caused flooding at the center, disruptingcommunications and computer operations.   The long-awaited launch of Discovery is expected to take placesometime in late September, but NASA officials said Wednesday theywould wait to set an exact date until they knew more about wherethe storm would go. They may announce a launch date Friday.   At Cape Canaveral on Thursday, engineers corrected a tiny leakin Discovery's engine system. The leak, traced to a valve, was theonly unresolved technical problem when more than 150 shuttlemanagers and engineers concluded a flight readiness review onWednesday.   If a later hurricane headed for the Space Center area during ashuttle flight, NASA is prepared to fly a group of flightcontrollers to White Sands Missile Range, N.M., so the shuttlecould be controlled from there. The flight controllers could get toWhite Sands within a few hours.   Hurricane Gilbert was in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday andseemed headed for the south Texas coast, but weather forecasterswarned it could turn northward and hit the Galveston area. Thespace center is located between Galveston and Houston.   Even if the storm did not hit the Galveston area, there stillcould be heavy rains and winds in the area and possible flooding.</TEXT></DOC>
