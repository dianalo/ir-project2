Trammel Crow declined to give the price, but First Wisconsin said it will receive $195 million for the 42-story building, the tallest in Wisconsin.    The closely held real estate development company said it plans to build an office tower containing luxury condominiums and retail stores on the rest of the eight-acre site once &quot;demand catches up with supply&quot; in the booming Milwaukee real estate market. About one million square feet of real estate are under construction in downtown Milwaukee.    The company said it would begin construction on the site east of downtown on the shore of Lake Michigan in the next three to five years, or earlier if it could find an interested anchor tenant for the building.    First Wisconsin, which will continue to occupy the building, said it will show a $77 million after-tax gain from the sale. Of the gain, $36 million will be posted in 1987 and the rest will be amortized over the next 10 years. The sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, the bank holding company said.    In the second quarter, First Wisconsin earned $13.1 million, or 61 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
