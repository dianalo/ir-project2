(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A trader implicated in Wall Street'sinsider-trading scandal was accused Friday of plotting to shootfinancier Ivan Boesky and charged with weapons possession andtrying to intimidate a government witness.   John A. Mulheren, a general partner in the firm Jamie SecuritiesCo., was arrested near his Rumson, N.J., home Thursday inpossession of an Israeli-made semiautomatic rifle, said MonmouthCounty Assistant Prosecutor Alton Kenney.   The loaded rifle and Army fatigue-type clothing were found inhis car, authorities said.   Mulheren was ordered held at Monmouth County Jail on $17,500bond Friday on charges of illegal weapons possession.   A complaint filed against Mulheren alleged the weapon was to beused ``against the person or property'' of Boesky, who is at thecenter of an insider-trading scandal that has shaken the financialworld.   The complaint also mentioned a possible attack against MichaelDavidoff, a former head trader for Boesky who is cooperating in aninvestigation of the financial scandal.   Authorities declined to say why they believed Mulheren wasplotting against Boesky and Davidoff. Mulheren once was a closeassociate of Boesky and has been implicated in the government'sinvestigation of Wall Street corruption.   In September, the Wall Street Journal quoted unidentifiedsources as saying Mulheren was cooperating with the government as aresult of Boesky's disclosures. It said the investigation couldlead to charges against Mulheren.   Meanwhile in New York City, federal prosecutors charged Mulherenwith attempting to intimidate a government witness formerlyemployed by Boesky.   The witness was identified in court papers only as ``WitnessX.'' Prosecutors refused to say whether the witness is Davidoff.   The complaint quoted Mulheren's wife as telling police he hadbeen ``extremely upset by the Boesky situation'' and ``was armedand was going to get'' the witness.   Kenney said police went to Mulheren's home Thursday and seized a9mm pistol, a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and a shotgun from thefamily car, but Mulheren was not arrested then because he waslicensed for the weapons.   In April, Boesky pleaded guilty to a criminal charge in theinsider-trading scandal and was sentenced in December to threeyears in prison. He is scheduled to begin serving the sentence nextmonth.   His whereabouts were not immediately known Friday. His attorney,Harvey Pitt, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.   Fred M. Stone, a lawyer for Jamie, said the company's partnersare discussing possible action as a result of Mulheren's arrest.   Stone also released a statement from Mulheren's attorney OttoObermaier, who said: ``It is known that John Mulheren has beenupset by the investigation by regulatory authorities of securitiesactivities and by the rumors and publicity which developed which hefelt unfairly impugned his honesty and integrity.   ``The important thing now is for him to get help and support topermit him to resume a normal and constructive life. He is in theprocess of seeking required medical assistance.''</TEXT></DOC>
