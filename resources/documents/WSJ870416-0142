In fact, the shortage appears to be an artifact of government regulation, in particular the state laws forbidding the sale of babies. The fact that . . . the costs of production to natural parents are much lower than the value that many childless people attach to children, suggests the possibility of a market in babies.    This is Prof. (now Judge) Richard Posner's notorious case for selling babies, published (with an illustrative supply-and-demand graph) in his textbook, &quot;Economic Analysis of Law.&quot; Posner is dean of the conservative &quot;Law and Economics&quot; movement out of the University of Chicago that has influenced so many Wall Street Journal editorials. President Reagan appointed Mr. Posner to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and he is often mentioned for the Supreme Court if the market for justices falls into disequilibrium over the next couple of years.    I naturally thought of this passage when I read the Journal's surprisingly censorious April 2 editorial on the conclusion of the Baby M surrogate-motherhood case. (&quot;Beyond Baby M,&quot; it was called. The &quot;Beyond&quot; formulation is one I also have resorted to on occasion for a headline that implies profound thoughts without undue specificity.) Ordinarily, the Journal's editors are great enthusiasts for &quot;freedom of contract.&quot; They even argue that it should be read into the Constitution. Here, though, they are &quot;troubled by attempts to reduce a fundamental biological function . . . to the level of contract law.&quot; They see surrogate motherhood as part of a cultural trend toward &quot;trivializing&quot; procreation and turning sex into &quot;nothing more than a means of gratification.&quot;    The politics of the surrogacy controversy have been odd. At first there was general sympathy for the infertile couple, the Sterns, and a general feeling that the surrogate mother, Mrs. Whitehead, was a bit nutty. As the trial progressed the Zeitgeist shifted. The Sterns' litigation steamroller, their seeming -- almost preening -- perfection as upper-middle-class professionals, created a backlash of sympathy for the underdog. By the end, a bizarre anti-surrogacy consensus had grown between liberals and feminists siding with Mrs. Mary Beth Whitehead on class and sex grounds, and social conservatives upset at the general implications of messing around with procreation.    Many people were repulsed by Judge Harvey Sorkow's heavy emphasis on enforcing the contract in awarding Baby M to the biological father and his wife. But why? The basic moral case for contract law, and indeed for capitalism itself, rests on the voluntary nature of exchange. Commercial trade is good for all the parties involved, or else they wouldn't engage in it. And in the vast majority of commercial transactions -- including the vast majority of surrogate-motherhood contracts -- the deal goes through with no problem, suggesting that both parties do indeed consider themselves better off.    Of course, contracts require enforcement by the state only when one of the parties is no longer content with the deal. But you need a way for people to bind themselves in advance in order for markets to function properly, and market-economy societies have decided -- quite rightly -- that the blessings of trade are worth the infringement on freedom. Defenders of surrogate motherhood who deny the commercial nature of the transaction (who say surrogate mothers are doing it out of love, and not for money) are being coy, and throwing away their strongest argument. The question, especially for conservatives, is why the essential moral logic of capitalism does not apply in this case.    After all, enforcing surrogate-motherhood arrangements is a much less radical step than legalizing an open market in babies. The &quot;product&quot; is arguably half-owned by the &quot;buyer&quot; already. Every baby &quot;produced&quot; is known to have a &quot;customer&quot; in advance; there is no danger of people manufacturing babies &quot;for inventory&quot; or &quot;on speculation.&quot;    Of course, society won't enforce all kinds of contracts. Even Judge Posner, presumably, agrees that you shouldn't be allowed to enslave yourself, even voluntarily. For this reason, I think that Prof. Hadley Arkes is probably wrong in suggesting in these pages recently (&quot;Judge Sorkow May Have Overstepped His Bounds,&quot; April 9) that a father constitutionally could do what a state legislature cannot and prevent a surrogate mother from having an abortion. But there is no issue of enslavement once a baby has been produced.    Society also regulates contracts, sometimes inserting mandatory terms, and there certainly is room for some of this as the practice of surrogacy evolves. Such terms might even include a statutory period in which the surrogate mother can change her mind. (Buyers of condominiums in the District of Columbia get 48 hours. Mothers giving up their babies probably deserve at least as long.) But should the state-imposed terms be so onerous that they send a message of social disapproval (or bare toleration) of this sort of thing, or should they be designed, like all good regulation, to help the benefits of market capitalism to flower?    In short, what good reason is there to thwart the wishes of two people to make this deal? One suggested reason is concern over &quot;exploitation&quot; of poor women by prosperous couples. Roman Catholic commentator Joan Frawley referred in these pages April 7 to &quot;the distasteful class war that seemed to dominate the custody fight for Baby M.&quot; But no one is forcing women to do this, and no one who wants to deny them the opportunity is offering them an alternative source of funds. This, once again, is the powerful logic of capitalism. And, once again, almost all surrogate mothers are apparently quite pleased with the arrangement.    But the satisfaction of the parties involved is not compelling to some conservative opponents of surrogacy (apparently including the Journal), who see this as part of a general trend they don't care for involving working women, divorce, abortion, untraditional families, welfare, and so on. I wouldn't argue that all these concerns are trivial. What I would argue is that the search for personal &quot;gratification&quot; with which some of these developments may be connected isn't merely &quot;trivial&quot; either. The Declaration of Independence calls it &quot;the pursuit of happiness.&quot;    A premise of our society -- our economic system, too, as the Journal often points out -- is that the total sum of human happiness is most likely to be maximized if people are permitted to pursue their own paths toward happiness with minimum interference, even (or especially) if those paths are eccentric. A vague foreboding about where all of this might be leading is not a good enough reason to get in the way.    ---   Mr. Kinsley edits The New Republic. </TEXT></DOC>
