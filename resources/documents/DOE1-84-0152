Examples of such rhodium carbonylclusters built from fused octahedra include the 'biphenyl analogue' [Rh/sub11/(CO)/sub 30/]/sup -2/, the 'face-sharing naphthalene analogue' [Rh/sub9-/(CO)/sub 19/]/sup 3-/, and the 'perinaphthene analogue', [Rh/sub 11-/(CO)/sub23/]/sup 3-/. More complicated anionic rhodium carbonyl clusters treatedin this paper include the [Rh/sub 13/(CO)/sub 24/H/sub 5-q/]/sup q-/anions (q = 2, 3, 4) having an Rh/sub 13/ centered cuboctahedron, the[Rh/sub 14/(CO)/sub 25-/H/sub 4-q/]/sup q-/ (q = 3, 4) and [Rh/sub 14/(CO)/sub26/]/sup 2-/ anions based on a centered pentacapped cube, the [Rh/sub15-/(CO)/sub 30/]/sup 3-/ anion having an Rh/sub 15/ centered 14-vertexdeltahedron, the [Rh/sub 15/(CO)/sub 27/]/sup 3-/ anion having a tricappedcentered 11-vertex polyhedron, the [Rh/sub 17-/(CO)/sub 30/]/sup 3-/anion having a tetracapped centered cuboctahedron, and the [Rh/sub 22/(CO)/sub37/]/sup 4-/ anion having a hexacapped centered cuboctahedron fused toan octahedron so that the octahedron and the cuboctahedron share a triangularface. Analyses of the bonding topologies in [Rh/sub 9/(CO)/sub 19/]/sup3-/, [Rh/sub 17-/(CO)/sub 30/]/sup 3-/, and [Rh/sub 22/(CO)/sub 37/]/sup4-/ indicate that a polyhedral network containing several fused globallydelocalized polyhedral chambers will not necessarily have a multicentercore bond in the center of each such polyhedral chamber. This observationis of potential importance in extending topological models of metal clusterbonding to bulk metals.</TEXT></DOC>
