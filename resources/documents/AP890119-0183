Justice Minister Fernando Nogueira said Portugal would receive a``substantial'' package of military equipment and increased U.S.cooperation in business, health, education and housing in return forcontinued use of the Lajes base.   The countries have been negotiating new terms for the base, onthe Azores island of Terceira, for almost a year.   Diplomatic sources previously said the U.S. side wanted toformalize an agreement before President-elect George Bush tookoffice.   Under the Lajes Accord, first signed in 1951, U.S. forces use thebase as a refueling point for the Air Force and as a submarinewarfare center. In return, Washington grants Portugal economic andmilitary aid.   The agreement was revised in 1983 with the understanding therewould be a ``rising trend'' in U.S. assistance to Portugal.   But fiscal 1988 saw $115 million in U.S. aid flowing into Lisbon,compared with $117 million in 1987 and $208 million in 1985.   Talks began last year after Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva,worried about the decreasing aid, formally requested a review of theaccord.   This month, Washington announced it would increase aid toPortugal to about $150 million.   Although the increase is not formally linked to the basenegotiations, Portuguese diplomatic sources have said theyinterpreted it as a ``gesture of good will.''   After Cavaco Silva called for a revision to the accord,government officials said they had asked the United States to equiptheir armed forces with F-16 fighter bombers, hawk missiles, combathelicopters and other military hardware to offset the shortfall inaid since 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
