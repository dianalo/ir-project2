LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets intoKabul on Friday, killing 10 people, and Foreign Minister AbdulWakil accused the United States and Pakistan of preparing a majoroffensive to oust his government.   Bakhtar state news agency reported 17 surface-to-surface rocketshit residential areas of the Afghan capital, killing 10 people andinjuring 19.   Wakil told reporters the United States and Pakistan are talkingpeace but preparing for war against his Soviet-backed government.   He urged the two countries to stop arming Afghan rebels ``andtake some effective, practical steps toward a political solution.''   He expressed hope that U.S. and Soviet diplomats will focus on acomprehensive political settlement of Afghanistan's 11-year civilwar when they meet Monday in Stockholm.   As Wakil left the airport after returning from a 12-day trip toEthiopia and India, a rocket exploded less than a mile away,churning up a cloud of dust. The extent of damage or casualties wasnot known immediately.   Several other rockets later struck the same Microrayon area, aresidential district for government employees that once housedSoviet officials before the last Red Army troops withdrew Feb. 15.   In the past month, fundamentalist Moslem guerrillas have beenlaunching long-range rockets from behind the hills that ring themile-high capital. More than 200 people, nearly all civilians, beenkilled in the attacks and a car bombing.   Wakil was asked whether he has discerned any progress toward apolitical settlement following last month's Washington meetingbetween President Bush and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ofPakistan.   The two agreed for the first time to press for a politicalsolution in Afghanistan but said they will continue arming theguerrillas and seeking to oust President Najib, a former secretpolice chief who is staunchly backed by Moscow.   ``I think they verbally speak of political settlement, but inpractice they have concentrated all their efforts to intensifyaggression and war,'' he said.   The foreign minister cited reports quoting unidentified Bushadvisers as saying Washington will arm the guerrillas with advancednew weapons to combat high-altitude bombing attacks by the Afghanair force.   ``We are of the opinion that the United States of America isgetting prepared for the battle season and for the extensiveoffensive in the coming months instead of preparing for a peacefulsolution,'' he said.   The foreign minister said the Afghan government considers theU.S.-Soviet meeting in Stockholm useful. The U.S. delegation willbe led by John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Near Easternand South Asian affairs, and roving Ambassador Nikolai I. Kozyrevwill guide the Soviets.   ``The most important thing that the United States and the SovietUnion should do ... (is) encourage hostile groups to find thepossibility for starting dialogue, talks and negotiations,'' Wakilsaid.   ``I think the United States and the Soviet Union in the meetingshould talk over an extensive, comprehensive program for theRepublic of Afghanistan for the settlement of the problem becausethe cessation or stopping of the supply of weapons is not enough.''   Wakil said the United States won't succeed in a militarysolution. The Kabul government did not collapse after the Sovietpullout, as Western governments predicted, and it won't fall in thefuture, he said.   He also said the Afghan leadership's desire for a settlement hasdictated its great patience in dealing with Pakistan, which hecharged is openly at war with Kabul.   In Addis Ababa, Wakil said, he received support forAfghanistan's peace initiatives from 30 leaders of the Organizationof African Unity meeting there.   He said he also held talks in New Delhi on Thursday with IndianPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who has discussed a politicalsettlement in Afghanistan with Ms. Bhutto, Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.</TEXT></DOC>
