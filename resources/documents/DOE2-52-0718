This decline was remarkable in the survivorswho were older than 15 at the time of the bomb (ATB). The results suggesta possible relationship between the recovery of T-cell-related functionand the thymic function which processes mature T-cells for the immunesystem. Thus it may be that, in the advanced age ATB group, the thymusfunction has started to involute allowing less recovery of T-cell functioncompared to young survivors who have adequate processing T-cell activity.</TEXT></DOC>
