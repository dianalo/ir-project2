Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Hot, dry weekend weather and forecasts for continuing heat sparked a rebound in corn and soybean futures, pushing prices higher by as much as the permissible daily limit.    Expected rains failed to fall over the weekend, and grain traders worried that the soybean crop would be further damaged during the last days of a critical growing period. Most of the soybean crop must form beans in the pods in the next week or so, or die sterile. Because of below-normal rainfall, soybeans haven't been getting enough moisture to form beans.    Traders also noted the unusually high temperatures in much of the farm belt. &quot;You have to remember that here in Chicago, we were in the 90s today,&quot; said Jon Davis, an agricultural meteorologist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;As traders walk to and from the trading floor, they can feel the heat. It's a heck of a psychological impact.&quot;    Weather conditions aren't expected to improve soon. After the futures markets closed yesterday, the National Weather Service's six-to-10-day forecast called for continued hot and humid weather with only scattered rainfall over much of the Midwest, and normal to above-normal temperatures in the southern Great Plains states.    As the critical growing period for soybeans ends this month, analysts said traders will be less concerned with weather conditions. &quot;The market came back roaring today,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;But the weather is becoming less and less important with every week.&quot;    Despite a sharp drop in price Friday, soybeans for November delivery rose by the permissible daily limit of 30 cents to $8.865 a bushel. Corn for December delivery soared its limit of 10 cents a bushel, settling at $3.055. Wheat also rose sharply, although prices stopped short of the 20-cent-a-bushel permissible daily limit for that commodity.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Hog and cattle futures rose moderately before the release late yesterday of an Agriculture Department cattle inventory report. The report, a monthly survey of cattle on feedlots in seven major beef-producing states, was expected to show a significant drop in the number of young animals channeled onto feedlots last month. While the report did show a 2.2% decline in placements from a year ago, that drop was far smaller than many traders expected, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with G.H. Miller, a Chicago-based unit of LIT America, London. Slaughterings during the month rose 3.6% from year-earlier levels, reflecting the difficult conditions caused by the drought.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose on a revival of concerns about inflation. The December gold futures price rose $1.70 to $442.90 an ounce, while September silver futures advanced 4.5 cents to $6.7850 an ounce. October platinum was up $5.30, to $536.30 an ounce. A buying flurry early in the session was stimulated by a Federal Reserve Board report that U.S. industrial production rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in July, following increases of 0.4% in June and 0.5% in May. The news followed other recent indications of economic strength that have triggered inflation concerns. One analyst noted that the grain and soybean markets also provided a lift to precious metals by opening higher, instead of lower, as had been expected. A cautious rebound in crude oil futures from initial weakness that enabled that market to end on the plus side was a supporting factor, too, he said, and so were the rise in the Commodity Research Bureau Index, which traders watch as an inflation indicator, and a slight softening of the dollar after its early rise. The outlook for the Peruvian miners strike remained cloudy. Traders called attention to an AP-Dow Jones Economic Report story that said Peruvian President Alan Garcia on Sunday raised the possibility of declaring a state of emergency in the nation's mining industry in an attempt to break the 27-day-old deadlock. But a mineworkers' spokesman said the strike would continue until the government responded to workers' demands, the AP-Dow Jones reported.    COCOA: Futures prices declined in reaction to continued selling of cocoa beans by the Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer. The September contract fell $46 to $1,327 a metric ton. One analyst observed that price trends this year have been determined by whether or not the Ivory Coast has been willing to sell cocoa. Since mid-July, when the West African nation began stepping up its offerings, the price has dropped more than $340 a metric ton, he noted. Another analyst, Sandra Kaul, of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York, commented that it was particularly significant that the Ivory Coast has been selling during the summer, a period of seasonally slow demand. This has been a price depressant because &quot;it has eased concerns that supplies of higher quality cocoa would remain tight until the harvest of cocoa,&quot; beginning in October, she said. </TEXT></DOC>
