In the first case, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it hadcompleted an agreement for the sale of American Savings and LoanAssociation of Stockton, Calif., to an investment group headed byTexas billionaire Robert M. Bass.   According to the details of the sale, the bank board, whichregulates the country's 3,100 savings and loans, will inject as muchas $1.7 billion in federal aid.   As costly as the American Savings bailout will turn out to be, itwas dwarfed by the announcement concerning the Texas institutions.   The bank board said it will provide $5.1 billion in governmentassistance over the next 10 years to assist in the takeover of fiveof the most financially troubled Texas institutions.   The Texas Sandamp;LS are being taken over by the investment group ofMacAndrews andamp; Forbes Holding Inc., which is headed by Ronald O.Perelman, the takeover specialist who is the head of Revlon Inc.,the cosmetics company.   As costly as the rescue packages will be, bank board chairman M.Danny Wall said that the cost to the government of simply closingthe insolvent institutions and paying off depositors would have beenfar higher.   In the case of the California institution, Wall estimated thecost of closing the institution and paying off depositors would havecost the insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp., $3.3 billion, compared to a cost of $1.7 billion for the saleto the Bass group.   With today's actions, the government has resolved the case of 181failed Sandamp;Ls this year, up from 48 last year.   Wall said today that he still expects to meet his estimate ofsettling 200 cases before the end of the year.   The board is rushing to complete transactions because tax breaksfor institutions getting government assistance will be reduced afterJan. 1.   The purchase agreement for American Savings, the country's secondlargest Sandamp;L and the biggest one that was classified insolvent, willrequire the Bass Group to invest $350 million in cash and addanother $150 million over the next three years.   In return, the government will provide an estimated $1.7 billionin financial aid.   Today's announcement culminates months of negotiations betweenthe bank board and the Bass Group.   In a statement, Bass said, ``I am delighted that our months ofhard work with the bank board and its staff have resulted in a newstart for American Savings. The employees and customers of AmericanSavings can start the new year knowing that they are now associatedwith one of the healthiest institutions in the country.''   More than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more areclose to insolvency.   Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry range from $50billion, made by the bank board, to $112 billion, the recentestimate by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm ofCongress.   Even with the rapid pace of rescues in recent week, analysts saythe problem is getting worse by more than $1 billion a month.   Congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout ofFSLIC when it convenes in January.</TEXT></DOC>
