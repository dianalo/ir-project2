Wayne Shiveley, director of the Justice TelecommunicationsServices Staff.andM;He said the General Services Administration is &quot;well into taking care of thecontractual issues.&quot;andP;  GSA administers the federal FTS 2000 contract forvoice, data and other intercity communications services.andP;  Justice has helpedto test the newer encryption technology on FTS 2000 packet-switched datanetworks.andM;Until the changeover, sensitive but unclassified departmental data willcontinue to travel across the country on dedicated lines through a series oflink encryptors.andM;Some people worry about the addresses being in the clear on the end-to-endencrypted public data network service, Shiveley said.andP;  But he expressedconfidence in the encryption technology offered by companies such asTechnical Communications Corp. of Concord, Mass., which makes the CipherX5000 to be used on the FTS 2000 network.andM;The closed user-group addressing on FTS 2000 packet-switched services offeredby US Sprint helps to reduce the worry about unencrypted addresses, Shiveleysaid.andP;  With everything multiplexed, a message cannot be stolen simply bycapturing a stream of traffic: &quot;They've got to be able to jump from onestream to another to pick it up, so it's not trivial.&quot;andM;Shiveley said the need to guard data is growing in response tocounter-narcotics activities at agencies like the Drug EnforcementAdministration.andP;  &quot;It's important that we protect our personnel.andP;  You'refighting a group of people that can do eavesdropping and taps.&quot;andM;Recent hands-on testing of end-to-end encryption gave officials some idea ofthe kind of network performance to expect.andP;  &quot;The setup is a littledifferent,&quot; Shiveley said.andP;  &quot;You have to wait a little longer to establish aconnection&quot; compared with the behind-the-scenes trunk encryptors on somedepartment subnets today.andM;&quot;We would like the performance to be a little better, but it's likeeverything else -- you don't get anything for nothing.&quot;andM;Besides DEA, the U.S.andP;  Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons and the FBI alsouse encryptors.andM;The Data Encryption Standard algorithm guards all encrypted Justicecommunications circuits that do not carry national security information.andM;Vendors who make electronic key management equipment are working with theTreasury Department, GSA and the National Institute of Standards andTechnology to get approval of an electronic key management standard.andP;  &quot;Wewould be reluctant to take on anything without approval,&quot; he said.andM;Justice officials are studying ways to design a &quot;next generation&quot; backbonenetwork with new technology that can isolate and handle several levels ofsecure data within a single processor or switching node.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
