EPA believes that emergency review andapproval is appropriate because: the information in the ICR is essentialto Agency's mission; it can only be obtained through the Department ofEnergy's (DOE) Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS);and it must be cleared by OMB by July 14, 1989, if EPA is to participatein the CBECS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Sandy Farmer at EPA, (202) 382-2740).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>EPA requests that OMB act on the ICR by July 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances</ITAG><T3>Title:</T3> EPA's Asbestos-Related Supplement to the Department ofEnergy's Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (ICR andplusmin;1502).<T3>Abstract:</T3> The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration,at the request of EPA, has agreed to add supplemental questons on asbestosto their triennial Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey. Buildingowners and operators will provide EPA with summer, 1989 data on the presenceand abatement of asbestos in commercial buildings. EPA will use this informationin its Asbestos in Buildings program.<T3>Case for Emergency Clearance: </T3>EPA considers the acquisition ofinformation on asbestos in commercial buildings essential to its missionto protect human health and the environment. Asbestos is a known humancarcinogen and its presence in public buildings represents a potentialhealth hazard. Without the information from this survey, EPA will be seriouslyhampered in its efforts to assess the risks from exposure to asbestos incommercial buildings, and may be unable to satisfactorily fulfill a promiseto report its assessment to Congress.The DOE's CBECS is the only nationwide, periodically updated (every threeyears) source of building characteristic data. The CBECS is well-designed,tried and tested, and has cleared OMB. It therefore offers EPA a uniqueopportunity to obtain reliable information on asbestos that can be extrapolatedto commercial buildings nationally. EPA plans to add to the CBECS fivesimple yes or no questions on the presence and abatement of asbestos inpublic hearings.If EPA were to ask these questions independently, we would have to developour own survey instrument and methodology, and repeat many of the questionson the CBECS. A second survey would be inefficient and costly, and wouldresult in needless duplication of effort by both EPA and the public. Infact, the costs of conducting our own survey on the scale of the CBECSwould likely be prohibitive.To join the DOE survey, however, we must act quickly. EPA has recentlylearned that DOE will begin to train personnel to administer the CBECSon July 14, 1989, and that we must have OMB clearance by that date if surveypersonnel are to incorporate our questions into the base questionnaire.Hence, our request for emergency processing and approval by July 14.<T3>Burden Statement:</T3> The public reporting burden for this collectionof information is estimated to average 6 minutes per response.
