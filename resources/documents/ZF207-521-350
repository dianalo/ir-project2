Winders andamp; Geist;and Wiremold.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     DirectoriesCablesCommunications EquipmentCatalogsBooks.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A CATALOG OF CATALOGSandM;AMPandM;The AMP catalogs are an encyclopaedia of wire and cable.andP;  The volumes areorganized topically, e.g.andP;  &quot;For Local Area Networks and ConstructionApplications.&quot;andP;  But each book is three-hole punched so that the reader canorganize them in a binder for convenient reference.andM;AMP has designed a new &quot;Siamese&quot; cable for use with AMP's CommunicationsOutlet.andP;  The cable is manufactured by Montrose Products to AMP'sspecifications and is sold through selected distributors.andM;The term &quot;Siamese&quot; comes from the dual jacket design that unites twotwisted-pair cables within discrete separable jackets.andP;  One half of the twincable carries voice or other low speed data over four 100 ohm unshieldedtwisted pair.andP;  The other half carries high speed data over two 150 ohmshielded twisted pairs.andP;  All signal pairs are 24 AWG solid copper conductors.andM;AnixterandM;Anixter's Wire and Cable catalog is truly a magnum opus.andP;  Almost as thick asa phone book of a major metropolitan area, this edition includes power andcontrol products, instrumentation, electronics, telephone wire and cable,data and computer lines and fiber optics.andM;Anixter recently announced that they'll market Proteon's complete line of PCnetworking solutions.andP;  &quot;Anixter's marketing objective is to provide systemsolutions to our customers,&quot; said Roland Watkins.andP;  Anixter provides multiplewarehousing facilities, same day shipment and other value added service.andM;ATandamp;TandM;ATandamp;T's catalog is really helpful.andP;  It's a very professionally done book witha fine table of contents and a forward in living color with generalinformation about the company's wiring offerings.andM;ATandamp;T electronic wire-and-cable designs range from traditionalsingle-conductor hookup wire found in small custom control applications toARTM Riser Cable.andP;  These are available in up to 3,600 pairs and are speciallydesigned to be used in vertical distribution shafts.andP;  These wires carry theanalog signals, digital pulses and power necessary for whatever you're doing.andO;They're good for telecommunications, computers, instrumentation, audiobroadcast, terminal wiring, LANs, hookup and plenums.andM;Not to play the big guy's today, ATandamp;T does have a load of innovative designslike: dual foam insulation that improves electrical performance and permitstransmission of higher data rates over longer distances; and irradiated PVCinsulation that provides tougher wire protection.andM;Champlain CableandM;Champlain's Plenum cable catalog includes cabling for computer communicationscontrol, fire protection and -- our favorite -- telephone uses.andM;Their 15-page catalog describes the company's offerings including informationon insulation, core wrap, jacket and options.andP;  Charts show important infosuch as pair color codes.andP;  The inside back cover sports a photo ofChamplainhs 188,000 square foot plant near Winooski, VT, and some of thebeautiful surrounding countryside.andM;Champlain's NEC 800-3(b)(3) communications circuits have a solid bare copperconductor, EXAR crosslinked polyolefin insulation and PTFE impregnated glasscore wrap on five-pair and larger circuits.andP;  The jacket is gray fluoropolymerwith band coding, sequential footage marking and jacket print marking.andM;ComCabandM;ComCab's 15th Anniversary Edition catalog contains 41 pages of buildingcabling stuff like switches, panels, pack mountable shelves, wall plates,cables and IBM Cabling System items.andM;The full-color cover shows some of ComCab's products.andP;  Interior pages featuretwo-color printing and clear drawings of the products listed.andP;  IBM CablingSystems products are illustrated with photographs.andM;Products include a Telco Modular Octopus with 26-gauge stranded, flatunshielded line cord with 2, 4, 6 or 8 conductors and optional twisted-pairwire.andP;  CAble accessories include D subminiature hoods in plastic or metal,gender changers, male and female D subminiature contacts and modular and Dsubminiature crimps.andP;  Sounds like fun.andM;ComservandM;The Comserv Integrated Cabling System Handbook and Catalog covers all thecabling aspects of voice and data systems integration including coax andtwinax link testers, distribution panels, RS-232 modular adapters, jacks,racks, cabinets, shelves, modems, multiplexers and more.andM;The catalog/handbook is about 59 pages long and contains pictures andthorough descriptions of the products listed.andP;  Each section of the catalog isintroduced with an overview of the products that are available with anexplanation of the different types of product and which types are best forcertain applications.andM;Comserv's Ethernet Thin Wire Cabling System sends data at 10 megabits overunshielded twisted-pair cable.andP;  The system includes the Comserv THN-11 balunand Comserv LAN distribution panels.andM;The company's Twinax Link Tester System checks out twinax pair cablecertification on construction sites or cabling that is already in place.andP;  Ittests for continuity problems, polarity reversals and checks for pulsedistortion, correct parity, conductivity, connectivity and excessive noise.andM;DiversibitandM;Diversibit makes all kind of bits useful for installing wiring and cable.andO;Instead of a bound catalog, these guys have a fold out brochure whichdemonstrates how their 130 or so products are used.andP;  The fold out is done inclassic black and white and has diagrams and line art to illustrate theproducts.andP;  A separate sheet lists the products with their suggested listprices.andM;Diversibit is always adding new drill bits.andP;  They're now offering a highspeed drill bit to the line.andP;  What really makes Diversibit's products usefulis the flexible shaft that lets the installer go inside covered walls (andother hard to reach places) to retrieve wire.andP;  The high speed bit is set in agrip which allows the bit to turn without twisting the wire.andP;  Obviously, astroke of genius.andM;General CableandM;General Cable doesn't like to overwhelm their customers.andP;  So they break uptheir line of products into small catalogs organized by subject.andP;  Forinstance, the Premise Wiring catalog is only about 10 pages long.andP;  Thecatalog, though small, contains such valuable information as NationalElectric Code charts, diagrams of typical premise wiring systems and the ULrating of each wire and cable.andM;General Cable's PVC Plenum Cable, is part of this company's state-of-the-artoffering.andP;  It's UL listed type CMP, low cost, low smoke PVC insulation cablewith high quality transmission.andP;  The cable is flame retardant and PVCinsulated.andP;  Up to 200 pairs are available.andM;GMPandM;GMP has one catalog with 11 sections.andP;  The section of special interest totelephone installers is a 12 page spread in two colors.andM;GMP recently introduced a comprehensive family of connector products.andP;  Thechief components in this family are a special connector presser,interchangeable dies, modular plugs, cordage and reel.andP;  These components canbe combined in any number of ways to make almost any kind of modularconnection currently available.andM;We especially like GMP's durable hand-held presser.andP;  It's cast fromprecision-machined 4100 series steel alloy and allows users to make fast,low-effort modular plug connections with a single hand.andP;  A unique linkage inthe presser's mechanism multiplies the operator's clamping effort by 20 timesat the point of compression.andP;  This provides enough crimping power to makereliable terminations onto solid wire.andM;All of GMP's plugs are molded from fire-resistant (UL 94V-) polycarbonatewhich is color coded for fast identification.andP;  Each phosphor-bronze contactis plated with 50&quot; (2 microns nominal) of pure gold for an extraconductive,high-luster surface that minimizes contact abrasion during insertion andremoval.andM;GNWCandM;GNWC's Industrial Wire and Cable catalog includes building cabling as well asother types of cables -- diesel locomotive and magnet crane cable are justtwo exmples..andM;The 18-page catalog has a full color cover and is printed on heavy, coatedstock.andP;  It's packed with cable specs and charts showing AWG sizes, ampacityand other vital cable info.andM;Their tray cable is approved for use in cable traya and conduits.andP;  It can beused where it is exposed to direct sunlight or for direct burial.andP;  It'srecommended for industrial control circuits where small diameter cables thatare highly flame-retardant are needed.andM;Leviton TelecomandM;Leviton's got a new Communications Wiring Products catalog.andP;  It's glossy.andO;It's big.andP;  It'll take care of your wildest wiring and cabling needs.andM;Leviton provides a unique service through their Applications Engineeringdepartment for custom job requirements.andP;  Product solution for specialapplications can be shipped overnight for customer approval prior toordering.andP;  Leviton will then assemble the modular components for a quickturnaround.andM;As for new products, Leviton just released a new Mounting Adapter, a bracketspecially designed to solve the problems of wiring a modular office fortelecommunications.andP;  This adapter fits a variety of modular office units,including the Steelcase Series 9000, Haworth, Knoll Morrison, Allsteel,Westinghouse and others.andM;It snaps easily into the slot of a modular office partition, allowing theinterface devices to be surface mounted using screws provided with theMounting Adapter.andP;  A cutout allows rear cable entry for a clean, unclutteredlook and tangle-free installation.andM;Nevada WesternandM;Nevada Western is a wholly owned subsidiary of Thomas andamp; Betts.andP;  Their heftyWire Management Solutions #7 catalog contains information on modular patchpanels, baluns, modular breakout boxes, information outlets, cabinets andracks, bulk inside wire, modular IDC splitters and much more.andM;The 97-page catalog has a full-color cover and introductory section whichincludes &quot;The Wire Management Story,&quot; information about the company and an&quot;Interview With An Electrical Contractor.&quot;andM;Nev-Star Twinax baluns and panels eliminate twinax cable and daisy chaining.andO;They convert twinax cable to twisted pair with termination in either an RJ-11or RJ-45 modular jack.andP;  Their modular breakout boxes are available inharmonica or box styles and port sizes ranging from 25 to four.andM;Newton InstrumentandM;CompanyandM;Newton gets our vote for the most practical catalog.andP;  Their entire line offine wiring is presented in a pocket-sized edition.andP;  The contents are nononsense diagrams that give the reader just what he needs to know.andP;  The bookis organized into four categories: auxiliary-framing cable racks;miscellaneous hardware; equipment racks; and frames and terminal blocks.andO;Newton also has a companion guide to prices.andM;Cable racks, in fact, are Newton's specialty.andP;  They've got bar type cableracks, channel type cable racks, trough type cable racks and last, but farfrom least, tubular side bar type cable racks.andP;  Newton will make any of theirracks to your special size and color.andM;North SupplyandM;North Supply's general catalog is 950 pages long.andP;  We are grateful that theysent us their Integrated Network Solutions catalog which weighs in at a&quot;mere&quot; 144 pages.andP;  It's still chock full of products, but it's a lot easierto lift.andM;The Integrated Network Solutions catalog has nine pages of wire and cableproducts, five pages of wiring systems and seven pages of fiber optic pagesand equipment.andM;There is a &quot;Housekeeping&quot; section, but it doesn't describe mops and featherdusters.andP;  Housekeeping includes important cable-related stuff like cablestrippers, crimping tools, line protection products, 66 blocks, cable ducts,cable clips and racks and panels.andM;Their Article 800 multi-pair cable is available in shielded and unshieldedversions.andP;  There are several choices of insulation material, jacket material,shielding material and it comes in 22 or 23 AWG BC.andM;PanduitandM;Panduit's Communication and Premise Wiring Products catalog describes surfacemounted boxes, wall plates, snap-in connector modules and other productsdesigned to be used with Pan-Way surface raceways or in-wall wiring.andM;The 44-page catalog features clear drawings and photos of the productsdescribed, many in full color.andP;  Full-color photos of Panduit's Pan-Ty cableties, Pan-Ty marker ties and Pan-Mark identification products let you see thevariety of colors these products are available in.andM;The last page shows a photo of a humongous building that is just some ofPanduit's one million square feet of plant and office space.andP;  They have fivefacilities in the US and plants overseas.andM;The products described include low profile surface-mount boxes in high impactplastic.andP;  They have a base and a cover and hold up to four connector modules.andO;Flush-mount wall plates with the same interchangeable models also appear inthe catalog.andP;  The boxes and wall plates come in an Electrical Ivory color.andM;SuttleandM;Suttle is truly &quot;an old friend with new ideas.&quot;andP;  They've got an extensiveline of catalogs to keep up the acquaintance across the miles and through theyears.andP;  Their comprehensive guide to telephone station apparatus is typicalof the company's literature.andP;  Black and white photos with all the essentialinformation is there for each product.andP;  Best of all, the catalog has anumerical index in the front.andM;Suttle's 1200 Balun series is available as adapters or in flush and surfacemount enclosures.andP;  These make data transmission on twisted-pair wiringeconomical and reliable.andP;  Plates and surface mount enclosures match and colorand dimension of standard telephone jack assemblies.andP;  It's pretty!andM;TransitionandM;EngineeringandM;Transition Engineering does not have a building cabling catalog, but theywill put together some building cabling product-sheets for you.andP;  Their lineof building cabling products includes baluns, twisted pair and balun testers,AS/400 two-pair cabling system and patch panels.andM;Their PortStar is a balun/concentrator for the IBM AS/400 and System 3X.andP;
