Government spokesmen said the Central Committee of the People'sDemocratic Party of Afghanistan would meet Monday to discuss``important matters,'' including efforts to bring the guerrillasinto talks with the government.   Vice President Abdul Rahim Hatif, in an interview Thursdayduring a flight from New Delhi to Kabul, said ``a concerted effortof all mentalities and from all walks of life is urgently needed.''   However, he called the guerrillas ``irresponsible people withcomplicated weapons'' and accused Pakistan and the United States ofcontinuing to the guerrillas, who are seeking to topple theSoviet-backed Marxist government.   On Thursday, Kabul police escorted three Western reporters tohomes they said were hit by guerrilla rockets the previous day. Atotal of 42 rockets hit Kabul in less than three hours Wednesdaymorning, killing 13 people and wounding 34, according to QurbanShayrzad, the city's deputy police chief.   One home shown to reporters was occupied by a soldier, MohammadShah, who said four women and one boy in his family were killedwhen a rocket hit the wall around their home on the north edge ofKabul.   At another nearby house, four girls between the ages of 2 and 9were killed by a rocket, according to their uncle, Mohammad Karim.   On Sept. 28, at least 33 people were killed and more than 130wounded in the worst round of rocket attacks on Kabul in recentmemory.   In other attacks around the country, anti-government guerrillasfired rockets at the southern city of Kandagar, hitting a hospitaland killing dozens of people, Tass reported Thursday.   The Soviet news agency, quoting its Afghan counterpart Bakhtar,said three patients and a nurse were among those killed inWednesday's attack.   On Thursday, a rocket attack killed a woman and her fourchildren in their house in the city of Charinkara in Parvanprovince.   A mine planted by terrorists tore apart a bus Wednesday inNangarhar province. Twenty-three passengers were killed and 13seriously injured, Tass said.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reportersat a Moscow news briefing that Soviet troops had broken a guerrillablockade of the city of Paghman in Kabul province. He said thesiege was ended after several days of fighting.   Despite government assertions, several Kabul civilians, speakingon condition of anonymity, expressed belief that some of therockets have been fired by Soviet or Afghan troops, who then blamedthe guerrillas in an effort to alienate their supporters.   The guerrillas, who call themselves Mujahedeen or Islamic HolyWarriors, have steadfastly refused to deal with the government ofPresident Najib.   Hatif, who said he does not belong to the Marxist People'sDemocratic Party, is one of four vice presidents named by Najibfour months ago in a show of broadening the base of his government.   However, key positions in the Soviet-backed government _including the presidency _ are held by the party or by politiciansclosely associated with it.   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to replaceone Marxist government with another and fight the nationwideinsurgency.   The Soviets agreed April 14 in Geneva to withdraw their morethan 100,000 troops from Afghanistan but said last week theysuspended the pullout because of U.S. and Pakistani violations ofthe pact. Pakistan also supports the guerrillas.   Hatif, a 63-year-old businessman, said Thursday that anygovernment should have both public support and the means to defenditself.</TEXT></DOC>
