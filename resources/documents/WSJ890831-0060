Alvin A. DeShano agreed to pay $24,772 in fines and restitution, without admitting or denying charges he used insider information in selling some of his stock in the Anaheim, Calif., fast-food chain.    Last June, a jury acquitted Mr. DeShano of securities fraud and insider trading, the only criminal charge in a case that had led the SEC to charge 16 people with civil allegations. Karcher's founder and chairman, Carl N. Karcher, and six family members settled with the SEC last month, but are still awaiting court approval. </TEXT></DOC>
