The closely watched trial, which began here last week, hadbeen seen by some as a test of First Amendment rights ofoperators of electronic &quot;bulletin boards,&quot; computers thatstore and forward text over phone lines.</LP><TEXT>   But the case was dropped after testimony showed thedocument wasn't the potentially dangerous and proprietaryinformation that the government had said it was, said SheldonZenner, attorney for the defendant, 20-year-old CraigNeidorf, of Chesterfield, Mo.   Mr. Neidorf was charged with conspiring with three Georgiamen who admitted breaking into Southern Bell Telephone Co.'scomputer systems. The three pleaded guilty to computer fraudlast month and are scheduled to be sentenced in September.   Mr. Neidorf's case differed from the Georgia cases in thathe wasn't accused of &quot;hacking,&quot; or illegally entering theSouthern Bell computers. Prosecutors instead focused on hisrole as an operator of the electronic bulletin board on whichthe document had appeared.   The focus of the case was a Southern Bell documentdescribing the administration of its emergency 911 telephonesystem. The government alleged that electronic publication ofthe document by Mr. Neidorf could have led to a disruption ofthe system. But the defense showed that the documentcontained information commonly available and could not havebeen used to endanger the 911 system.   A spokeswoman for the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. AttorneyWilliam Cook, said, &quot;We received information during thecourse of the trial that changed our case drastically, and weno longer felt that felony charges were appropriate.&quot; Shesaid the defendant agreed to submit to pre-trial diversion, aform of court supervision similar to probation. &quot;If he keepshis nose clean for a period of time, he won't have a criminalrecord,&quot; the spokeswoman said. She added that &quot;the trialnever got to the First Amendment issues.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
