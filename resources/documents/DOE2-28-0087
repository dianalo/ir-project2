Recent advances in the technology of several compositematerials prompted the Department of Defense to request that the Institutefor Defense Analyses undertake a study of the international state ofthe art in composite-materials and the export control of composite materialstechnology. This report presents the results of an 18-month study ofU.S. and foreign technology in organic matrix, metal-matrix, carbon-carbon,and ceramic-matrix composite materials and a critical review of the U.S.export control regulations. The report consists of three volumes, asfollows: Volume I - Main body of report (Unclassified, proprietary information).Volume II - Appendices (Unclassified) Volume III - Foreign Technology(Secret, intelligence sources andamp; methods involved). Emphasis was placedon the identification of critical technology items in which the U.S.has a decided lead and which might be used by an adversary to the detrimentof the national security of the United States. Information was providedby more than 80 industry and Government organizations abroad in Europeand Japan. An overall comparison of the technological status in the majorindustrial countries of the world has been made. For the most part, thetechnology has been advanced further on a broad front in the U.S., withsome significant contributions to the technology from foreign sources.</TEXT></DOC>
