Trading volume on the Seoul Stock Exchange was exceptionally light Monday, with only about 20 million shares changing hands. Volume was about one-fourth the level of activity just three weeks ago, when the government stepped in to cool the market with a series of new restrictions.    The exchange's composite price index slipped 1.5 points to 355.86 as nervous investors sold on worsening news about Pan Ocean Shipping Co. and Korea Shipbuilding andamp; Engineering Corp.    The companies, two of South Korea's biggest concerns, were placed under the court-ordered management of their banks as they teetered on the brink of financial collapse.    Korea Exchange Bank took over Pan Ocean last week, days after the company's chairman, Park Ken Suk, killed himself, and its president, Han Sang Yon, resigned. Both men were under investigation for alleged illegal diversion of foreign currency.    Mr. Han was arrested Monday on charges of tax evasion and capital flight, the government said.    The government at first handed management of Pan Ocean, with its estimated $1.16 billion of debt, over to Bank of Seoul andamp; Trust Co., the company's prime creditor. Two days later, it stymied the business community by transferring control to Korea Exchange Bank and announcing a plan to rescue the company, which it said is technically insolvent, as it expands its investigation into possible wrongdoing by Pan Ocean executives.    Disclosures during the weekend that Korea Exchange Bank is considering dismantling Pan Ocean and selling off its profitable subsidiaries, coupled with the resignation of eight company directors, increased investor anxieties, traders said.    The case surrounding Pan Ocean has also touched off an angry public outcry because the company was bailed out only a few months ago under a massive government program to rescue the shipping industry.    The effect of Pan Ocean's difficulties on the market, traders said, was exacerbated by news that foreign creditors of Korea Shipbuilding, which has $675 million of debt, were raising questions about the general credit-worthiness of South Korea's private sector. Korea Shipbuilding, the nation's oldest and biggest shipyard, unexpectedly was placed in receivership April 16.    &quot;Suddenly we are faced with the possibility that many companies in South Korea are not as sound as they appear on their books,&quot; a broker said. &quot;That's enough to worry any sensible investor.&quot;    But some traders disagreed with that assessment. &quot;I don't think the fact that two more companies go belly-up is having too much of an effect, except perhaps psychologically,&quot; said a broker for a leading securities house.    He and other brokers attributed the market's continuing bearishness to government limits, announced April 3, on the holdings of institutional investors.    &quot;I think the main reason for the slump,&quot; the broker said, &quot;is that the government has tried to cool off the market. The investors know that, and they're holding back because they don't think it's reached the bottom.&quot;    He added, &quot;Some of the big names are taking their money out of the market and are looking for places to put it temporarily. That's why we have low volume. And until we have a rise in volume, we're going to have a drifting market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
