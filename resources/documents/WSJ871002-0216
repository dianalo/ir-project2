The resignations reflect the continued conflict between the large real estate developer's regional offices and its Dallas headquarters over the company's efforts to adjust to increased competition and to tighten control of its growing business.    Warren E. Spieker, former regional partner for commercial real estate in Trammell Crow's Menlo Park, Calif., office, said he and the other 10 partners who resigned last week &quot;decided it would be more appropriate to return to a smaller operation.&quot; Mr. Spieker said the parting was &quot;amicable.&quot;    Trammell Crow said the resignations are a normal reaction to its recent restructuring. &quot;When you have this much change at once,&quot; a spokesman said, &quot;some people are going to decide to go their own way.&quot;    Eleven of the regional office's 12 partners left to form the new company. In addition to Mr. Spieker, the new company consists of four other former partners in the Menlo Park office, as well as former partners in Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.    Trammell Crow said it named Joel Peterson, one of the company's two national managing partners, to succeed Mr. Spieker as head of the Northwest regional office. The company's Los Angeles office was not affected by the resignations.    Under Trammell Crow's regional system, the partners hold an equity stake in properties developed by the offices in their region, and the national office holds the rest of each property. The new company, Spieker Partners, will continue to own a majority of the $1.2 billion portfolio of properties developed in the Northwest by Trammell Crow.    Spieker will also manage 75 of the 140 properties jointly owned with the company. The properties include the 26-story Montgomery Washington Tower in downtown San Francisco, as well as office buildings, warehouse and shopping centers in the Northwest.    Last March, Mr. Spieker and three other Trammell Crow partners in the Northwest regional office told the company that they planned to retire. At the time, people at the company suggested that the partners objected to the company's efforts to streamline its operations and give more control to Trammell Crow's Dallas headquarters.    Mr. Spieker declined to confirm the objections, saying only that &quot;the reorganization highlighted some philosophical differences between us and the company.&quot; He added, &quot;We wanted a little more freewheeling, personal type of atmosphere.&quot;    In January, eight partners in the company's Chicago regional office left Trammell Crow, citing their displeasure over the reorganization. </TEXT></DOC>
