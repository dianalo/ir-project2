In a banquet speech for visiting Ethiopian President MengistuHaile-Mariam, Kim also denounced U.S. plans to reinforce itsmilitary presence in and around South Korea during the Sept.17-Oct. 2 Olympics in Seoul, the communist North's official KoreanCentral News Agency reported.   The KCNA English-language report, monitored in Tokyo, wastransmitted late Thursday night. No immediate reaction came fromSouth Korean officials.   Last week, North Korea proposed that legislators from the twoKoreas meet in Pyongyang, the North's capital, to discuss anon-agression pact. In a second letter Tuesday, it said it wasready to consider ending its boycott and entering the Olympics ifthe South would consider its demand to act as host at the Games.   South Korean officials have said they were studying the lettersand would respond ``affirmatively,'' but they want to meet in thetruce village of Panmunjon in the Demilitarized Zone that dividesthe two Koreas.   Said Kim: ``These days, the United States is reinforcing massivearmed forces in and around South Korea on the plea of guaranteeing`Olympic safety,' and at the instigation of the United States, theSouth Korean authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than everto keep our nation divided forever.   ``What is needed ... is a dialogue for great national unity andreunification ... and the co-hosting of the Olympics,'' Kim said.   The International Olympic Committee has rejected North Korea'sdemand to act as co-host at the Games, saying they are awarded toonly one city.   The Korean Peninsula was divided into communist North andpro-West, capitalist South in 1945 at the end of World War II. Thetwo halves fought the bloody Korean War from 1950 to 1953 andremain bitter rivals.   Kim added without elaborating that ``the standing committee ofour Supreme People's Assembly has decided to send a letter ofproposal to the U.S. Congress for negotiations.''   It was this assembly, North Korea's rubberstamp parliament, thatsent the two letters to South Korea's National Assembly throughPanmunjon.   Kim noted that Marxist Ethiopia has ``taken the same stand withus in the struggle to realize Olympic co-hosting.''   Cuba, Albania, Nicaragua and the Seychelles also are boycottingthe Games, but 161 nations plan to attend in what will be thelargest Olympiad, with about 12,000 athletes competing.</TEXT></DOC>
