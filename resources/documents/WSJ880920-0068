Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., will buy a minority interest in an IBM unit that owns three communications satellites. Hughes will also take over all the marketing of the satellites, which are owned by IBM's Satellite Transponder Leasing Corp. Neither company would elaborate on the terms.    The companies reached the arrangement despite their well-publicized fight in recent weeks over the Federal Aviation Administration's decision to award IBM a 12-year contract to modernize the nation's air-traffic control system. Hughes accused IBM of all sorts of nefarious behavior, including inflating prices on IBM equipment that would be used in any system Hughes built. IBM has denied the charges. The General Services Administration has set aside the contract award pending a review.    &quot;This (announcement) has nothing to do with that argument,&quot; an IBM spokesman said. A Hughes spokeswoman concurred, noting that different parts of the companies were involved in the two issues.    IBM initially had big plans for its satellite operations, through a joint venture in transmission services. But after sinking more than $1 billion into Satellite Business Systems without ever making much headway, IBM and its partners sold out to MCI Communications Corp. in 1986. IBM held onto the three satellites, but through the arrangement with Hughes it will be backing even further from the long-distance telephone market.    The venture gives a big boost to Hughes's efforts to market private business communications networks using Very Small Aperture Terminal, or VSAT, technology, the spokeswoman for the GM unit said.    Previously, Hughes had been designing private voice, data and video systems for businesses, then leasing satellite time from the IBM satellite unit. Now Hughes will control the use of the two satellites IBM's unit has in the air, as well as a third scheduled to be launched in 1990 or 1991. IBM and Hughes -- which, in fact, built the three satellites for IBM -- said they have a combined asset value of more than $250 million.    &quot;This is very strategic for us,&quot; the Hughes spokeswoman said. &quot;This is the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle for us to be a full-service provider for VSAT&quot; communications networks, she said.    ---   Joseph B.
