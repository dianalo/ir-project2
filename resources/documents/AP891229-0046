Florida Gov. Bob Martinez declared his entire state a disasterarea Thursday and sought federal help, while Texas officials workedto open relief centers for farm workers displaced by the worstfreeze to hit the lower Rio Grande Valley in six years.   Elsewhere in the Deep South, crews worked to restore waterservice after the past week's freezing weather burst pipes andmains.   Somewhat more moderate temperatures were returning to the South,though at 5 a.m. EST today it was only 36 degrees in Jacksonville,Fla., 33 degrees in Macon, Ga., and 26 degrees in Knoxville, Tenn.Cities in the North were being spared the arctic blasts of recentweeks, though snow fell from Salt Lake City to the Dakotas thismorning.   The hard freeze Saturday and Sunday nights damaged oranges andgrapefruit in Florida's 700,000-acre citrus belt as well as wintervegetable crops. The dollar value of the loss had yet to bedetermined.   The state's tropical fish industry, sugar cane crops and plantnurseries also were hurt badly.   After visiting several freeze-damaged farms, Martinez signed anexecutive order declaring the disaster in all 67 Florida counties.The move opens the way for a possible federal disaster declarationby President Bush.   ``From what I have seen, there is no question that Florida hassuffered devastating losses and that our state is a disasterarea,'' Martinez said. ``We must now do everything we can to helpthose whose lives and livelihoods have been ravaged by theunmerciful weather.''   In a letter, Martinez asked Agriculture Secretary ClaytonYuetter to approve Farmers Home Administration loans for growers.Unemployment assistance, direct grants and other help also couldbecome available if Bush declares a disaster.   State agriculture officials will assess each county to compileloss estimated, which would be needed before a federal declarationis made. That could take two or three weeks.   A freeze in 1985 freeze cost the Florida citrus industry aloneabout $255 million.   Higher vegetable prices have already been reported, but theimpact on citrus prices could be minimal because of a large juicereserve and the quick processing of frostbitten fruit into juiceconcentrate.   Florida's 33 citrus processing plants were pushed to the limitThursday in an effort to salvage frozen fruit and squeeze it intojuice before it spoils.   ``We'll be open 24 hours per day, seven days a week during thesalvage process,'' said Steve Caruso, assistant general manager atCitrus World, a processing plant in Lake Wales that produces about400,000 gallons of fresh juice daily.   In Texas, officials estimated that 60 percent of the lower RioGrande Valley's $80 million citrus crop and 80 percent of itsvegetable crop was lost when temperatures dropped into the teensand 20s last weekend.   There are 15,000 farmworker families in the Rio Grande Valley,and Hidalgo County Judge Edgar Ruiz expects many to seek helpbecause without crops, they won't have work. The American RedCross, the Texas Department of Human Services and Hidalgo Countyplan to open four relief centers.   In Jackson, Miss., where an estimated 60,000 people were withoutwater or had greatly reduced pressure earlier this week, city crewsfinished repairing 28 remaining breaks in the city's 900 miles ofpipes and mains.   City officials asked some businesses to conserve water, but toldresidents Thursday night they could safely use tap water for thefirst time in nearly a week.   Jackson officials also reported two cold-related fatalities,including a 62-year-old man who died of heart problems when he fellin a lake while trying to collect water to flush his toilet.   At least 104 deaths nationwide since Dec. 15 have beenattributed to the cold. Several of the victims were children inSouthern states who fell through ice on ponds or lakes.   The cold killed fish in Louisiana bayous and is threatening seaturtles around Florida. The cold-blooded reptiles are sensitive totemperatures and the cold makes them lethargic. Also in Florida,the cold chased endangered manatees into pockets of warm water nearpower plants.</TEXT></DOC>
