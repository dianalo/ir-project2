Polls show large majorities inevery demographic group think that term limits would limitthe baleful influence of professional politicians and injectnew blood and competition into the system.

Taxpayer groups had forced a vote on aninitiative to limit the mayor and City Council to two termsof two years each. Business leaders, labor unions and bothmajor newspapers campaigned against the idea. But when thevotes were in, term limits won with 65%. They were approvedeasily in the council districts with large Hispanic and blackpopulations.</LP><TEXT>   San Antonio marks the ninth straight victory for termlimits since the idea first caught on eight months ago.
