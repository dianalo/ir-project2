Sources include ``Biotechnology and GeneticDiversity,'' by Steven C. Witt, director of California AgriculturalLands Project, and material from the U.N. Food and AgricultureOrganization.</TEXT><TEXT>   1770: Benjamin Franklin, then a colonial agent in England, sendshome America's first soybeans.   1845-9: The Irish potato famine kills more than 1 million peopleand turns 2.5 million others into emigrants. Scientists cite it asone of history's prime examples of the genetic vulnerability ofagricultural crops.   1898: U.S. Department of Agriculture opens its ``Section of Seedand Plant Introduction.''   1917: Stem rust destroys more than 2 million bushels of U.S.wheat; government orders two ``wheatless days'' a week.   1925: Soviet scientist Nikolai Vavilov, modern history's greatestseed hunter and plant geneticist, leads first global seedexpeditions. Imprisoned by Stalin in 1940, he dies three years later.   1930: U.S. Plant Patent Act is passed, providing protection forplant cuttings of new crop varieties.   1945: The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization is founded.   1958: The National Seed Storage Laboratory opens in Fort Collins,Colo.   1970: Southern corn leaf blight, called the ``genetic shot heard'round the world,'' destroys U.S. corn worth $1 billion and raisesworld consciousness about genetic diversity and importance ofpreserving germplasm.   1970: Congress passes Plant Variety Protection Act, extendingpatent rights to new varieties propagated with seeds as well as withplant cuttings.   1973: First successful experiments with genetic engineeringgreatly increase potential value of plant germplasm, enablinggermplasm to be spliced directly into crops, saving years of tediousbreeding.   1974: International Board for Plant Genetic Resources is foundedto coordinate collection of germplasm and preservation in seed banksaround the world. USDA establishes the National Plant GermplasmSystem.   1979: Researchers publish report on the discovery of Zeadiploperennis, a perennial wild relative of corn with valuabledisease resistances.   1980: U.S. Supreme Court, in Diamond vs. Chakrabarty, extendspatentability to genetically altered bacteria, suggesting that it'spossible to patent genetically engineered plants.   1981: General Accounting Office issues report sharply critical ofU.S. seed bank system.   1983: An FAO commission enacts the International Undertaking onPlant Genetic Resources, extending principle of free internationalflow of germplasm to patented commercial seeds.   1987: FAO commission establishes international fund to channelmoney from industrialized nations to training and conservationprograms for germplasm in developing countries.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, March 27</NOTE></DOC>
