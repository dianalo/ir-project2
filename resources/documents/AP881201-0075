At 35, she also becomes one of the world's youngest heads ofgovernment and the first woman prime minister to lead a Moslemnation in modern times.   Ms. Bhutto, who was educated at Harvard and Oxford, inherits thepolitical mantle of her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar AliBhutto, who was ousted by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq in a 1977 coupand hanged two years later.   Zia's death in an Aug. 17 plane crash made Ms. Bhutto, who hadpledged to restore democracy, the nation's only nationallyrecognized political leader.   Although a daughter of affluence, Ms. Bhutto's appeal lies mainlyamong the poor masses of this country's 107 million people. They arethe strength of her left-leaning Pakistan People's Party, whichcaptured the most seats in the Nov. 16 National Assembly elections.   Ms. Bhutto drew massive, adoring crowds during her campaign forthe country's first free elections since her father's death.   Mindful of Moslem and local custom, she always is clad intraditional clothes with a scarf draped over her head.   The poised and articulate leader, who speaks English fluently,shocked her Western friendsby consenting to an arranged marriagelast December with Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari.   Ms. Bhutto, who has kept her maiden name, was groomed forpolitics by her doting father as the eldest of his four children. Hesent her to study government and politics at Harvard in the UnitedStates then at Oxford.   It was at the British university that she tasted her firstpolitical success when she was elected president of the prestigiousOxford Union debating society in 1976.   The prime minister's post is Ms. Bhutto first paying job. Heronly previous employment began in early 1977 as a non-paid traineein the Foreign Ministry.   It was short-lived, however, as Zia toppled her father'sgovernment a few months later on the pretext that elections thatyear were rigged.   Bhutto was hanged in 1979 after his conviction for helping plotthe murder of a political foe, a charge his family has denied.   Despite years of detention and foreign exile during Zia'sauthoritarian rule, Ms. Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat, kept theparty alive as Zia's disenfranchised opposition.   Ms. Bhutto's party critics claim she has inherited her father'sdomineering ego but has renounced his socialist ideals.   Her supporters say that with Zia gone, she is Pakistan's onlynationally recognized political leader and a unifying force in thecountry's volatile ethnic mosaic.   Her party commands 105 votes in the 237-seat National Assembly,and Ms. Bhutto says she has enough support from independents andminor parties to command a majority.   Ms. Bhutto espouses prosperity for the poor but has appeased thebusiness community with promises of a market-oriented economy, andthe military by pledging to continue Zia's staunch backing with theUnited States of Moslem anti-communist rebels in neighboringAfghanistan.   She started her election campaign in late October, following theSept. 21 birth of her first child, a son named Bilawal.   Ms. Bhutto rarely has appeared with her husband in public and hasnot yet allowed public photographs of their baby.</TEXT></DOC>
