Gallup Pakistan recently surveyed 1,300 of the more than 2.1 million Afghan refugee families in Pakistan. It concluded that some 9% of the population, or 1.5 million people, probably has been killed. Marek Slewinski, a scholar at Geneva University who worked on the survey, reports that casualties actually have increased during Mikhail Gorbachev's era of glasnost. </TEXT></DOC>
