<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-1035 </DOCNO><TEXT>From a detailed combustion testing program and earlier experience withLeigh Creek coal, the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) gaineda wide insight into the use of low rank coal fired boiler plant. Thiswork is fundamental for the selection of boiler design parameters andother details which in turn determine the correct coal deposit selectionfor future power station development. In addition it gives boiler designersa good indication of the measures required to give reliable plant operation.Extrapolation from experience with existing plant, the designers mainsource of information, was not considered appropriate because of thelack of experience with similar coals. Brown coal beneficiation is alsobeing assessed by ETSA in an attempt to improve the coal quality by thepretreatment of the raw coal prior to combustion in future coal firedboilers. ETSA is also involved in the development of circulating fluidbed and gasification processes to determine whether these alternativeprocesses are a more viable method of utilising the South Australiancoals than pulverised fuel firing. 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
