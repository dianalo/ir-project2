Tracing the Hanau scandal the book tries to reveal theoverall factual background of the complex risk involved. Light is thrownon the most threatening aspects placing emphasis on the final disposalof radioactive wastes and the abuse of fission material useable in nuclearweapons. A government making common cause with the nuclear industry andhiding the risks involved from the public will fail both in the dutyof inspecting and controlling affairs and in the elementary duty of informingthe public.
