GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TAUNGGYI, Burma (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At a news conference staged to persuadeforeign journalists that Burma's military junta is dealingmagnanimously with the opposition, a student leader suddenlychallenged an army officer.   It is not true, shouted Myo Win Htun, that students attackedtroops in Taunggyi during last year's pro-democracy demonstrationsas the officer claimed. It was the army _ he asserted to applausefrom his colleagues _ that fired into crowds, killing students intheir early teens.   The outburst appeared to reflect what many Burmese say is adefiant mood and a widespread, smoldering hatred of Burma's powerfulmilitary _ which had turned its guns on students, Buddhist monks andothers agitating for an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule.   The deep rift in Burmese society, with its potential for renewedviolence, is but one of a host of problems facing this impoverishedsoutheast Asian nation now shunned by the international community.   ``The current situation is complex. The future is bleak anduncertain,'' said one Burmese journalist.   The same military that crushed the uprising in September haspromised general elections and allowed more than 180 politicalparties to register. It has also attempted to woo the population bysweeping streets, whitewashing pagodas and providing basiccommodities to the poor at special stores.   Many of Burma's 38 million people have reacted to such moves withderision and are watching the power holders for signs of meaningfulchange.   ``If there are no elections we will demonstrate again,'' studentAung Myint Soe told reporters in the town of Loikaw. ``We have notgiven up the struggle for democracy.''   Such critical statements, made in the presence of officialsduring a three-day visit by 46 foreign journalists this month, wouldhave been unthinkable prior to the upheaval.   Possibly fearful of another revolt, the military rulers areallowing more freedom of expression than in the days of retiredstrongman Ne Win.   Although clearly designed to improve Rangoon's tarnished humanrights image, the visit by journalists was also unprecedented in acountry that had virtually barred all foreign reporters and seemedto care about outside opinion.   ``We are moving towards an open society. We need foreignbusinessmen, investors. And of course journalists must come,'' saidone official who accompanied the press trip.   However, the new leaders stress that change must come slowly andview the brutal repression last year as the military eliteexercising its rightful role in saving the country from``unpatriotic and destructive elements.''   ``Every country controls mobs. And if they refuse to actaccording to the law, you shoot them,'' said one senior militaryofficer.   The government says 500 people were killed in September'sviolence. Western diplomats put the death toll at double that amount.   Four months after the Sept. 18 coup by Gen. Saw Maung, a curfewremains in force along with a ban on public gatherings and tightcontrol over mass media. With the exception of nursery schools, thecountry's educational system has been closed for more than a year.   Saw Maung has spurned calls for dialogue by opposition partyleaders and rejected one of their major platforms _ reconciliationwith a dozen ethnic minority insurgents who have been battling thegovernment for decades.   Instead, the Rangoon military has mounted a major campaignagainst one of the strongest rebel groups, the Karen National Union,and is using up what little foreign currency it earns from the saleof teak and fish to buy guns and bullets.   The country's long-suffering economy slid deeper into ruin lastyear as the international community, outraged by human rightsabuses, cut off aid. A number of Western analysts say a furtherdeterioration of living standards could reignite protest as surelyas the negation of political freedoms.   ``An economic revival under current conditions is almostimpossible. The economy just manages to keep breathing,'' said oneknowledgeable Burmese.   Most major industrial enterprises remain closed and privateforeign investors are reluctant to enter a politically volatilesituation despite the recent reversal of the country's closed doorpolicies. Burma is currently unable to repay the interest on its $4billion foreign debt.   Many Burmese say they are putting their hope in the promisedelections although there are serious questions about when they willbe held, whether they can be free and fair and whether the militarywould accept any victor who might threaten its power and privilege.   ``I'm not sure whether the government is sincere about holdingelections,'' said 26-year-old student Aung Htu. ``For 26 years themilitary has been on top. I don't think they want to give up theirstatus.''</TEXT></DOC>
