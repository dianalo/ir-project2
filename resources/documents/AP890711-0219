The department is in the early stages of a projected $5 billionprogram with private industry to develop those ``clean coal''technologies.   The technologies are not expected to be ready for commercial usebefore the turn of the century.   The department said Monday that a draft analysis of theenvironment effects of the new technologies concludes that theycould reduce national emissions of sulfur dioxide from existing coalplants by as much as 45 percent by the year 2010.   Nitrogen oxide emissions could be cut by as much as 33 percentover the same period, it said.   Both pollutants are precursors of the acids that form and fall asacid rain when smokestack gases are carried long distances by thewind.   The analysis said clean coal technologies could result in a 5percent to 12 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions whenused to refurbish older conventional power stations. Carbon dioxide,an inevitable combustion product from any carbon-based fuel, is themajor gas responsible for the predicted ``greenhouse effect''trapping of heat in the atmosphere and warming of the earth.   While the air pollutants could be reduced, the Energy Departmentstudy said the effects on solid waste were less clear. It said theamount of solid waste generated could range from a 22 percentreduction to a 23 percent increase.   It did not explain the disparity in projected solid wastegeneration, but said these wastes would be in a dry form that ismore easily handled than the wet sludge generated by the scrubbersused to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestack gases of newercoal-burning power plants.   ``The commercialization of clean coal technologies would have asubstantial beneficial effect on air quality in the year 2010compared to the no-action alternative,'' the study said.</TEXT></DOC>
