On a voice vote, the panel approved a budget resolutionthat sets federal outlays at $1.46 trillion and anticipates anear-record deficit of $289.6 billion for the year thatbegins Oct. 1. The outlays would grow by $66 billion from thecurrent year, for which the deficit is projected to hit arecord $299.9 billion. The resolution, which isn't binding,is expected to be approved by the House as early as nextweek.</LP><TEXT>   Before passing its measure, the committee yesterdayrejected the president's budget proposal as well as two otherplans that would have cut projected spending more deeply thanthe adopted version.   The committee's resolution adheres to the strict spendingceilings imposed by last year's budget accord and doesn'tcall for any tax increases to narrow the deficit. The measuredoes project that the annual deficit will be graduallyreduced over time because of the spending limits.   The document, whose outline was drafted by the committee'sDemocratic majority, reflects significant restraint onspending. Cuts of 1% were applied to selected housing,transportation and agriculture programs, for example. Inaddition, some programs, such as those for space exploration,would get smaller increases than the president proposed.   Spending growth above the levels sought by the presidentwas proposed for various programs that the Democrats hope touse for political advantage. These include education,nutrition and anti-drug abuse programs.   But the changes from the president's proposals wererelatively small -- a fact that Republicans on the paneldelighted in highlighting. Of the roughly $200 billion indomestic spending appropriated annually, the committee's billrecommends that only $10 billion, or 5%, be placed incategories other than those the president chose.   The budget resolution doesn't foreclose the possibility oftax increases later in the year to pay for specific newprograms or tax breaks. But committee Chairman Leon Panetta(D., Calif.) has said that by failing to mandate any tax risein the budget resolution, the chances for raising new taxesare diminished.   The Senate Budget Committee is expected to draft its ownbudget resolution soon.</TEXT></DOC>
