(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cooler temperatures were helpingtoday as firefighters from four states battle blazes that haveburned over 12,000 acres of forest and grassland, officials said.   The largest fire, at Lost River near Warroad, was 80 percentcontained this morning, according to Jean Bergerson at the stateDepartment of Natural Resources information office here.   ``Everything is in various stages of mop-up and cleanup today,''she said.   Firefighters from Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire arrivedSunday and will be helping Minnesota firefighters, she said.   About 200 fires, many of them small, had broken out over theweekend across northern Minnesota, but Bergerson said there were nomajor new fires this morning.   ``We expect cool weather to hold for the next couple of days,but there's still no rain so the fire danger will remain high,''said support dispatcher John Olson at the Northern Fire Center herelate Sunday night.   Eighty U.S. Forest Service firefighters from Wisconsin andMichigan arrived in Duluth on Sunday and were dispatched to firezones, said Thomas Kroll at the Fire Center.   A crew from White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshirearrived late Sunday night, Olson said.   The Lost River fire, which began Saturday, has consumed 7,100acres.   ``It's burning in lowland bog, so there's not too much potentialdamage,'' Kroll said. ``There's some farms that could be threatenedif the fire burned quite a bit longer, so we're taking action on itnow.''   A picnic area at the Huntersville State Forest in Wadena Countywas destroyed by a fire that burned 570 acres. The fire, which wascontained Saturday night, burned outhouses, tables and trees in thepicnic area, he said.   No other buildings were destroyed, but Kroll said there weresome close calls.   A fire near Brainerd came within feet of one home, and threehomes in the Rutledge area had to be evacuated, but firefightersstopped all the fires before they got to the buildings, he said.   Kroll said fires burned 10,000 acres of Forest Service propertySaturday, and over 2,000 acres on farm property.</TEXT></DOC>
