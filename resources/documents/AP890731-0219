Egyptologists say Zoser's pyramid, the world's first majorbuilding in stone, was considered a staircase to heaven. Somemodern designers say the use of stone simulations brings an touchof richness and grace to the modern home.   ``This is the age of faux finishes _ the look of marble, stone,even wood achieved through creative techniques _ on everything fromwalls and floors to fabrics and accessories,'' says designer JanetCarter.   ``The design emphasis for the 1990s is on texture and creatingan illusion of depth. The popularity of stone simulations has ledto numerous fabric and furnishing accessories that add distinctionand polish.''   Carter adds that with today's new faux finishes, floors, wallsand furnishings can have the look and durability of stone withoutthe hassles.   ``Simple painting techniques, for those even a little handy witha paint brush, allow you to create the elegance of stone for one orall walls in a room,'' explains Carter, a member of the ColorMarketing Group and American Society of Interior Designers.   Real stone, from solid marble to delicate slate, she says, ishard to care for, expensive to replace and often too heavy forresidential walls and floors.   ``There is a strong trend toward contemporary designs in sheetvinyl floors. Stripes, chevrons and banding combined with the lookof stone capture a contemporary elegance for any environment,''says Gerald Ewan, director of styling for Mannington ResilientFloors.   Some designers note that while the look of stone may be classic,the homeowner should remember not to get carried away with a trend.   Stone looks can either make a strong statement on walls, floorsand furnishings, or create a subtle effect with accessories, linensand pillows.   ``Stone maintains its elegance when strategically placed tocomplement its surroundings,'' says one industry observer.</TEXT></DOC>
