About 4.5 million workers now face exposures above the newlimits, the Labor Department said in completing a two-year projectthat represents the first large-scale changes to exposure standardsin nearly two decades. Employers have until September to comply.   ``We are literally taking a 20-year technological leap,'' saidPendergrass, head of the department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration. ``This is the biggest action OSHA has taken in itshistory.''   OSHA estimated that in addition to preventing about 700 deaths ayear, the tighter limits should prevent 55,000 illnesses and 500,000lost workdays each year attributed to workplace exposure tohazardous and toxic materials. Rough estimates provided by theagency indicated the new standards could cut exposure-related deathsby one-fifth, illnesses and lost workdays by one-fourth.   The reductions in maximum exposure limits cover some of the mostcommonly used industrial materials and byproducts, includingacetone, carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, chloroform, hydrogencyanide, perchloroethylene and styrene.   Substances regulated for the first time include wood dust andgrain dust, acrylic acid, butane, gasoline, paraffin wax fumes,tungsten and welding fumes.   Some substances are known or suspected carcinogens; others canhave narcotic-like effects on humans. Still others are blamed forkidney, liver, heart and respiratory ailments while some are majorskin and eye irritants.   The limits cover the maximum amount of a substance a worker canbe exposed to at any given time and during an eight-hour workday.   OSHA said it needed to conduct further review before settinglmits for exposure to asphalt, fibrous glass dust and mineral wool.Those substances had been subject to new standards under theagency's draft regulations, but conflicting data presented duringpublic hearings prompted OSHA to delay final decisions.   The changes announced Friday could cost employers on average$6,000 a year for each affected workplace, though that would varygreatly, the government said. Costs could range from $77,400 a yearfor petroleum refineries to $360 annually for auto dealers. Theaverage per-worker cost is $150.   The department considered limits for more than 400 industrialchemicals and substances in a single review, departing from a policyof case-by-case study that had produced new, comprehensive standardsfor just 24 substances in 17 years.   After the review, the government decided to let stand existinglimits on 52 substances. The new limits on the others take effectMarch 1 and employers must be in compliance by Sept. 1.   Exposure limits will remain unchanged for 169 additionalsubstances not covered by the two-year review. Some of them arecurrently being reviewed on an individual basis.   The new standards apply only to general industry but will beextended, following additional proceedings, to construction andmaritime industries as well.   New limits were first suggested two years ago. A draft wasreleased last summer followed by 13 public hearings and a publiccomment period during which more than 90 companies, tradeassociations and labor unions testified and submitted documents forOSHA to consider.   The new federal guidelines will require 23 states and theterritories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to checkOSHA-approved local standards they have adopted to make sure theymeet the new regulations.   Those states are:   Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina,Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,Washington and Wyoming. Affected to a lesser extent are Connecticutand New York, which have state exposure standards for localgovernment employees.</TEXT></DOC>
