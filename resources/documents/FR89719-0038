The principal thrust of theproject is an integrated facility which will produce medium-BTU gas. Initially,a majority of the gas will be available to support facility operations;however, a portion of the gas should be made available for experimentalpurposes, such as, cleanup for use as synthesis gas, shift to adjust hydrogen/carbonmonoxide ratios, and synthesis reactions for the production of methanoland other liquid fuels. Further, the facility should be constructed suchthat on-site experiments leading to methanol synthesis may be conductedin the future. Proposers may propose to utilize a feedstock consistingof a combination of different biomass feedstocks including municipal solidwaste. Fossil fuel(s), either alone or in a mixture with biomass, may notbe used as a feedstock.Proposer must be a United States citizen (if proposing as an individual);or a U.S. business organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S.;or a state, local government, or other jurisdiction within the U.S., oran instrumentality thereof. If the proposer is a domestic corporation whichhas foreign ownership, then the controlling interest in the corporationmust be held by a U.S. citizen, corporation, or governmental unit. If theproposer is a partnership, then the controlling interest in the corporationmust be held by a U.S. citizen, corporation, or governmental unit. Theproposer must make a commitment to construct and operate the proposed projectwithin the United States, i.e., the 50 United States or the U.S. territorialpossessions. DOE expects at least 50% cost sharing of the project, althoughthis is not a firm requirement. The share of the costs to be contributedby the proposer, and the amount of DOE funding requested, are importantselection considerations. DOE has funds available in the amount of $5,000,000.The resultant agreement will be managed by the DOE Chicago Operations Office/SAOand is expected to have a five year period of performance. Proposals willbe due 120 days from the release of the solicitation. A preproposal conferencewill be held 20 days after issuance of the FASCAP. If you are interestedin receiving the FASCAP and in attending the preproposal conference, contactPatricia Russo Schassburger at the above address or phone number. All responsiblesources may submit a proposal which will be considered.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Chicago, Illinois, on June 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy S.
