The National League team assured fans that the walkout will notdisrupt operations at the ballpark this season, which opens in threeweeks.   The groundskeepers began picketing outside the field at midnightafter contract talks with the Cubs broke down Monday, said RichardMalkowsky, union secretary-treasurer. The old contract expired Dec.31.   Construction workers getting skyboxes ready for the NationalLeague opener April 4 joined the picket line when they arrived forwork in the morning, said police Sgt. Ed Kehoe. He estimated morethan 150 persons picketed or honored the lines.   Malkowsky said about 300 building-trades workers refused to crosspicket lines. The 24 groundskeepers are paid an average of $21,000 ayear, he said.   ``They (Cubs management) didn't have enough time to slot us infor scheduled talks because they were busy giving millions ofdollars away to the ballplayers,'' he said.   Union attorney Don Cohn said the ballplayers union also will beasked to join in when they return from spring training in Mesa,Ariz., but Malkowsky said, ``I'm hoping we can resolve it before theseason starts.''   The groundskeepers walked out over a management effort to cutnearly in half their $14-an-hour wage and win other concessions,said Sam Bongiorno, a 23-year veteran of the groundskeeping crew.   The team said in a statement, ``The Cubs are certainly willing tocontinue negotiations but, in any event, we assure our fans thatthis will not disrupt operations at the ballpark this season.''   Cubs officials declined to discuss the strike further.   No new talks were scheduled, Cohn said.</TEXT></DOC>
