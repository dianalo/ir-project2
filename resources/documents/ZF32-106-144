Allen today told Congress it would putconsumers and the telecommunications industry at potential risk by approvinglegislation to allow the Bell Operating Companies to manufacturetelecommunications equipment.andM;Allen, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, saidlegislative proposals to combine manufacturing and local telephone companymonopoly operations &quot;would cripple today's competitive industry, not help itflourish.&quot;andM;He added the proposals &quot;would recreate the very structural relationship thatstagnated the industry in controversy for nearly three decades--arelationship where local monopolies own their own manufacturer.&quot;andM;Allen said the Department of Justice under Republican and Democraticadministrations in the past contended &quot;that this relationship wasanti-competitive.&quot;andP;  He said the government, in splitting apart ATandamp;T and theBell Companies in 1984, decided that &quot;severing the bond (was) the only way ofprotecting consumers from problems inherent in having local telephonemonopolies owning captive manufacturing suppliers.&quot;andM;Allen said Congress should recognize the positive impact of public policiesin place since the Bell System break-up.andP;  He said global and domesticcompetition in manufacturing communications equipment has intensified,investment in research and development has increased, U. S. equipment exportshave risen 29 per cent and the trade deficit for telecommunications equipmenthas dropped 70 per cent.andM;By contrast, Allen said, &quot;legislating a return to yesteryear, with all thepossibilities for abuse, will wash out these gains.andP;  Worse, it will takeAmerican jobs--and American high-tech leadership--with it, as the RegionalBell Operating Companies inevitably partner with foreign competitors.&quot;andM;Commentary: Again, though not asked by anyone, EDGE agrees with Allen'sposition.andP;  The last thing we need is for the seven rich monopolies to controlmanufacturing.andP;  They already support (financialy), Bellcore, which sets thestandards of what products are certified for use by the twent-one Telcos.andP;  Ifthe RBOC's were allowed entry into manufacturing, it is absurd to think thatthey would, on their own, fund manufacturing start-ups in the U.S.andP;  Rather,they'd likely partner with those manufacturers already in the business, andthat includes all of the foriegn companies.andM;Since divestiture, the cost of long-distance has plummeted.andP;  Not so the costof local phone bills.andP;  The opposite is true.andM;The average stock price of the RBOCs steadily improved and that only meansthat profits are good!andP;  If the RBOCs were so concerned about the &quot;loss ofU.S.andP;  Randamp;D capacity,&quot; why don't they propose NON-PROFIT U.S.andP;  Randamp;D andmanufacturing companies, funded by LOANS from the RBOCs?andP;  Let Bellcoreparticipate in strategic direction and certification.andP;  That would satisfytheir professed nationalism but, wouldn't improve the bottom-line.andM;With the ability to control manufacturing, the opportunity to overprice, and&quot;pass-along&quot; would be enormous.andP;  Wasn't that what the MFJ was all about?andM;See next story for a contrary view.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
