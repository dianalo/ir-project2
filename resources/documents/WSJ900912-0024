Negotiations between Algoma and the steelworkers unionbroke off on Aug. 24, and both sides said it is unlikely thetalks will resume anytime soon. The 6,000 Algoma steelworkershave been on strike since their contract expired July 31.</LP><TEXT>   The move to retrieve the dies, an effort to honor acontract with the General Motors of Canada Ltd. unit ofDetroit-based General Motors Corp., outraged union officials,who resorted to calling Algoma &quot;a bunch of liars.&quot; A unionofficial said the trucks' markings were covered up to preventidentification. The company, a unit of Dofasco Inc., declinedto comment on that issue. Dofasco, Canada's largeststeelmaker, is based in Hamilton, Ontario.   An Algoma spokesman said, &quot;We've shipped these parts outof the plants to ensure GM a continued supply of theseunfinished auto parts.&quot; Some of the parts go to GM directly,while others are sent to third parties for finishing beforebeing sent on to GM, he said.   The spokesman said Algoma has a longstandingcustomer-supplier relationship with GM. &quot;If we did nothing,GM would manufacture new dies, which would be used byAlgoma's competitors, and Algoma would lose that business,and that would result in lost jobs,&quot; he said.   A GM official said that, while the company owns some ofthe dies, its only role in the events is as a customer.   Union officials said the company didn't have any right tomove in while the strike is under way. &quot;We think that this isa low blow,&quot; Doug Watt, vice president of Local 2251 of theUnited Steelworkers of America, said. &quot;The company isn'twinning any friends.&quot; He said that Algoma is the onlysupplier of the parts to GM, and that this is &quot;a major GMcontract.&quot;   The Algoma spokesman wouldn't discuss the value of thecontract and wouldn't say where the 30 dies would be shipped,though a person close to the company said some of the dieswould go to Dofasco plants.   Meanwhile, talks between the United Steelworkers andStelco Inc., a Toronto-based steelmaker, continued with theaid of a mediator. Officials on both sides refused to commenton the talks. The union represents more than 10,000 Stelcoemployees who have been on strike since July 31.</TEXT></DOC>
