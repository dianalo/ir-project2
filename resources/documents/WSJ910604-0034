The July contract fell 1.08 cents a pound to 84.50 cents.October cotton fell by the two-cent limit then recoveredsomewhat to end at 77.05, down 1.78. December cotton, thefirst contract to reflect the &quot;new crop&quot; 1991-92 harvest,finished 1.62 cents lower at 73.17 cents.</LP><TEXT>   The heavy rains that have deluged the Mississippi Deltaregion for weeks and kept farmers out of the fields let upover the weekend, said Peter Leavitt, executive vicepresident of Weather Services Corp., a Bedford, Mass.,consulting firm. He forecasts favorable weather conditionsfor planting through the rest of the week in the delta.   The West Texas region, which has been too dry to plantcotton, received moderate to heavy showers over the weekend-- enough to encourage planting by cotton farmers, Mr.Leavitt added.   As expected, planting progressed last week. As of June 2,Mississippi had 69% of its crop in the ground, compared withjust 45% the week before, according to William Dowdy,agricultural statistician at the National AgricultureStatistics Service, an agency of the Department ofAgriculture.   Louisiana was 74% planted, up from 62% the week before.Last year at this time Louisiana was finished planting, andMississippi was 97% completed.   Still far behind the pace was Tennessee, with just 50% ofits acreage planted, compared with 90% planted last year.Texas stood at 65% planted, compared with 83% a year earlier.   All told, 74% of U.S. cotton acreage was in the groundlast week, compared with 89% the year before, according toMr. Dowdy.   The cotton that has been planted in the Mississippi Deltaarea looks very good, said O.A. Cleveland, economist atMississippi State University. Some farmers are saying thecotton is coming up &quot;so fast they can almost see it growing,&quot;he said in a telephone interview.   But another 850,000 to one million acres remain to beplanted, and farmers will be making the big push to get it inthe ground before this weekend, he said.   Assuming normal weather from here on, about 70% of thecrop will produce a normal yield, Mr. Cleveland forecast,adding that the remaining acreage will suffer between a 25%and 40% yield reduction.   &quot;We don't have much margin for error as far as MotherNature is concerned,&quot; Mr. Cleveland said. &quot;She has to berather kind to us.&quot;   Sharon Johnson, cotton specialist at Cargill InvestorServices, noted that there was an absence of buying by peopleand companies in the cotton trade to support the price whenit began to fall yesterday. By contrast, such buyingmaterialized during similar market tumbles recently.   &quot;The party was over,&quot; she said.   Domestic mills have largely taken care of their cottonneeds for the time being, she said. Moreover, any pricemovement above 90 cents a pound historically has beenshort-lived. Since July cotton hit its peak of 94.45 centstwo weeks ago, the price has fallen 10 cents.   She expects yesterday's fall to be followed by a &quot;bounceof some consequence,&quot; but doesn't think the liquidation byspeculators is over. July cotton could trade as low as 82cents over the next several trading sessions, she predicted,and December as low as 71.50 cents.   Mr. Cleveland expects prices will be weak today, then will&quot;gingerly try to climb back up.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices rose on wetweather worries and anticipation that an announcement of acredit package for the Soviet Union is imminent. PresidentBush yesterday waived for one year the law stipulating thatno nation that restricts emigration can receive credits tobuy U.S. grain. Traders interpreted this as a necessary steptoward an expected announcement this week that the U.S. willgrant export bonus credits -- perhaps totaling as much as$1.5 billion -- to help alleviate food shortages in theSoviet Union. In addition, persistent rains in grain-growingregions raised worries for some crops -- and helped pushfutures prices higher. In Iowa and parts of Nebraska, wetweather has significantly delayed corn planting. In southernIllinois, mushy fields are creating conditions that lead todisease in the crop of hard red winter wheat. The price ofthe corn contract for July delivery rose four cents to$2.4975 a bushel; the July soybean contract rose 3.5 cents to$5.8525 a bushel; and the July wheat contract rose 5.75 centsto $2.9275 a bushel.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures prices rose. Hogslaughter was lower than normal and lower than a year ago,and traders anticipated that the weekly cold storage reportdue out today would show net outward movement of porkbellies, or uncured bacon, from cold storage. This wouldindicate smaller supply than demand, a condition that exertsupward pressure on futures prices. The July contract rose1.20 cents to settle at 59.35 cents a pound.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rallied. Sugar for July deliveryended 0.42 cent a pound higher at 8.47 cents. Analysts saidthere wasn't any news to account for the rise, althoughrumors circulated about delays in Thailand and Cuban sugarshipments caused by weather and other problems. Also helpingraw sugar prices has been firm prices of refined, or white,sugar, said Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch.But most of yesterday's rise in sugar futures prices wastechnical in nature, said Scott Servetah, a floor broker atCargill Investor Services. Standing buy orders, particularlyfrom commission houses, were executed when the price hit 8.25cents and 8.38 cents, probably to cover short positions, hesaid. Traders cover short positions, or bets that the pricewill fall, by buying offsetting contracts. Any further rallywill run into strong resistance between 8.59 cents and 8.66,he said. If prices fail to rise above that range, they willprobably fall to at least 8.25, he predicted. James Steel,analyst at Refco Inc., thinks prices will move higher inearly trading today, but expects the rally to lose steam bythe end of the session. &quot;There's too much sugar out there,&quot;he said, and selling by the sugar trade will weaken any priceadvance.</TEXT></DOC>
