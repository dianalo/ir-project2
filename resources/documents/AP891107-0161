(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state's second annual alligatorhunt netted nearly 130 more gators than the first season andofficials expect healthy catches for years to come.   During the month-long hunt in September, 222 licensed hunterscaught 3,117 gators, including a 13-foot-6 monster bagged on thenorth side of Lake Okeechobee and a 685-pounder from Lake Georgenear Ocala.   The catch represents about 91 percent of the quota and compareswith 2,988 caught in 1988, the first state-sanctioned alligatorhunt in 26 years.   Part of the reason officials renewed the hunts was theburgeoning alligator population, believed to exceed 1 million inFlorida.   ``We're not trying to reduce the alligator population,'' saidMike Jennings, a wildlife biologist with the Florida Game and FreshWater Fish Commission. ``We want to have these hunts years afteryear.''   A study of this year's catch indicated the alligator populationis generally healthy and growing well, said Jennings.</TEXT></DOC>
