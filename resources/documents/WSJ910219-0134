Those words aren't easy to write. When he didn't like a1982 article I'd written, according to the Greensboro, NorthCarolina, Daily News, the North Carolina Republican attackedme as an &quot;ultraliberal&quot; with a mission &quot;to destroy RonaldReagan and Jesse Helms.&quot; In the quarter-century I've beencovering Washington, Sen. Helms is among only a handful ofpoliticians with whom I've developed a mutual animus.</LP><TEXT>   But as the Senate Ethics Committee investigates the fivesenators accused of influence-peddling on behalf of infamoussavings-and-loan boss Charles Keating, Sen. Helms and his GOPcolleague from Mississippi, Trent Lott, are justifiablyoutraged. Sen. Helms has expressed incredulity at theexplanations offered by some of the Keating Five, whom he haslikened to &quot;Keystone Kops running around bumping into eachother.&quot;   His attitude sharply contrasts with that of most of theDemocrats on the ethics panel -- particularly the juniorsenator from North Carolina, Terry Sanford, who from day onehas thrown softballs at the accused. If there's an appearanceof conflict here, he has said, &quot;the remedy rests with theinstitution, not the individuals.&quot;   The committee Democrats are playing political games. Theyare trying to hold the one Republican, John McCain ofArizona, hostage to ensure easier treatment of two Democrats,Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald Riegle of Michigan. Itwill be travesty if they get their way and these DemocraticSenators get off with only a slap on the wrist.   What happened here was a disgrace. Five senators held aprivate session -- all staff barred -- to browbeat regulatorsover a continuing investigation. The subject, CharlesKeating, had such a sleazy reputation that the Reaganadministration -- yes, the Reagan administration -- refusedto appoint him to an ambassadorship he sought. But he had oneimportant asset: He was doling out well over $1 million tothe five senators. Mr. Keating's failed Sandamp;L eventually hascost the taxpayers $2 billion.   The senators' basic defense is that this is the wayWashington works -- that everybody does it. That argument wasdemolished by the Ethics Committee's outside counsel, RobertBennett: &quot;I do not accept that explanation from my threechildren. . . . Courts do not accept it, and the Senateshouldn't.&quot;   Even the two least culpable lawmakers, Mr. McCain andDemocrat John Glenn of Ohio, didn't act admirably. Sen.McCain took more than $100,000 from Mr. Keating, let thebusinessman pick up the tab for his family vacations and usedhis corporate plane as a personal taxi service. Sen. Glenn'spolitical action committee got some $200,000 from Mr.Keating, who also hired three former Glenn aides to assist inhis influence peddling and got the senator to arrange aspecial session with House Speaker Jim Wright.   But they were plainly the two less active participants inthe effort to win Mr. Keating special consideration fromregulators, and backed away as soon as they heard he was thesubject of a criminal investigation. Mr. Keating then calledhis old vacation friend, Sen. McCain, a &quot;wimp.&quot;   At the other extreme is Sen. Alan Cranston. Mr. Keatinggave the California Democrat more than $850,000 for politicalactivities; the senator in turn pressured the feds on hisbenefactor's behalf right up until the Keating empirecollapsed -- and well after he knew a criminal investigationwas under way.   The case against Sen. Cranston will be taken to the fullSenate, where he will deservedly be punished. But to limitthe punishment to him would be pure political cynicism. Mr.Cranston is undergoing cancer treatment and is retiring fromthe Senate. What better sacrificial lamb? As Ethics CommitteeDemocrats privately bargain to keep the other cases away fromthe full Senate -- using threats against Republican McCain asleverage on behalf of Democrats Riegle and DeConcini -- theywill cite the action against Sen. Cranston as proof thatthere's no partisan whitewash.   But even a cursory look at the Riegle and DeConcini casessuggests that is exactly what is going on.   Sen. DeConcini was the ringleader of the Keating Five. Heheld the initial session to plan the intervention with theregulators in his office. According to the regulators, heapplied pressure on behalf of Mr. Keating right up through1989 -- two years after he was told that the thrift executivemight face criminal charges.   Sen. Riegle, in line to become chairman of the BankingCommittee, got $78,000 from Mr. Keating and his associatesalmost exactly at the time that the initial session was beingscheduled. Mr. Bennett, the ethics committee's councilrevealed that Mr. Riegle had numerous other sessions withFederal Home Loan Bank Board officials on the Keating matter.Yet his lapse of memory during the Ethics Committee hearingswas so extraordinary that two explanations are possible:Either he has an early case of Alzheimer's disease, or hewasn't telling the truth.   If committee Democrats have their way, however, Sens.DeConcini and Riegle will receive only admonitory letters,the matter will never go to the full Senate, and they willcorrectly claim they received only a minor wrist-slap. Awrist-slap is what Sens. McCain and Glenn deserve; to treatany of the others the same is unconscionable.   Some Democrats think they can get away with thispolitically, but their confidence may be misplaced. Twocomparisons will be made immediately. One will be to theHouse, which displayed guts and integrity in dealing with thecase of Speaker Wright in the previous Congress. The otherwill be to the words of one senator last year during thedebate over punishing Republican David Durenberger forfinancial irregularities: &quot;It is imperative that the Senate .. . rule and judge and exact a just penalty for actions whichreflect poorly on the integrity of the Senate.&quot;   That senator was Terry Sanford. If this distinguishedformer governor and president of Duke University abandonsthat standard in the Keating Five case, he will sign hisre-election death warrant for 1992.   To say that the cases against Sens. Riegle and DeConcinideserve a stern justice isn't, as syndicated columnist EdwinYoder contended, a &quot;goo-goo view that the Senate shouldconsist of platonic guardians prayerfully deliberating in afinancial vacuum.&quot; This unparalleled, private gang assault byunited senators on behalf of a well-known, sleazy characterwho happened to be a big campaign contributor may not havebeen bribery in the legal sense.   But that certainly was the spirit of what happened. And itclearly disgraced the Senate.   Don't let them get away with it, Jesse.   ---   Mr. Hunt is the Journal's Washington bureau chief.</TEXT></DOC>
