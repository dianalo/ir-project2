The licenseeproposes: (1) A new intake/outlet structure at the Lewiston Reservoir;(2) two new 22-foot-diameter steel lined and concrete-reinforced powertunnels approximately 700 and 725 feet long connecting the new intake structureto the proposed powerhouse; (3) two new 30-MW pump-turbine units in a commontrench installed in a low-profile powerhouse, 96 feet wide by 310 feetlong; (4) a new tailrace channel, approximately 140 feet deep and varyingin width from 60 feet at the powerhouse to 140 feet deep at the forebay;(5) upgrading of each of the existing 175 MW generating units at the RobertMoses Niagara Plant with new units capable of 200 MW; (6) a new 1,500-foot-long,230-kV overhead transmission line crossing the forebay and connecting tothe existing 230-kV switchyard; and (7) other appurtenances. The licenseeestimates that this expansion would generate an additional 965 GWh of peakdaytime energy, a reduction of off-peak energy, and total annual energycould vary between an increasing of 30 GWh to a reduction of 120 GWh dependingon the actual efficiency of the new runners.l. <T4>Purpose of Project:</T4> The additional project energy would be soldto the licensee's customers.m.
