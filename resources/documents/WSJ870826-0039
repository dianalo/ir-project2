He also confirmed that he and another Minneapolis investor have, over the past six months, accumulated a hefty position in New York-based publisher McGraw-Hill Inc. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, McGraw-Hill shares soared $7 to $79.50, following a published report in USA Today of Mr. Jacobs holdings.    Although Mr. Jacobs for months has been known to be holding a large stake in Gillette, until now he has been reluctant to talk about his purpose. &quot;We are carefully looking at the situation right now,&quot; he said, indicating that &quot;whatever decision we'll make will be made in the short term.&quot;    On Monday, Gillette's board refused a $47 a share bid from Revlon Group Inc. That bid carried an indicated value of $5.41 billion in cash and securities.    &quot;I'm not telling you $47 is or isn't the right number, but they (Gillette's management) won't even give these people the right to come forth,&quot; Mr. Jacobs said. &quot;They're doing nothing but protecting their entrenched management,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm incredibly disappointed.&quot;    A Gillette spokesman said last night the company hadn't any comment on Mr. Jacobs' remarks. He noted that the company earlier this week explained its reason for rejecting Revlon's proposal.    As previously reported, Gillette's board, in rejecting the Revlon proposal, said it believes its future is bright as an independent concern. It had also rejected an earlier bid of $40.50 a share. Last year, after Revlon made a $32.50 a share tender offer for Gillette, it dropped the bid, sold a 13.9% stake back to the company and signed a standstill agreement that permits any future tender offers only with the consent of Gillette's board. The board has refused to grant that consent.    Mr. Jacobs said he hadn't talked with Revlon about its repeated unsuccessful bids for Gillette, but was becoming increasingly unhappy with Gillette's position. While critical of Gillette's rejection of Revlon's bids, Mr. Jacobs said he respects the company's efforts to remain independent &quot;if they're dealing with the best interests of their shareholders . . . But they aren't giving any alternatives to shareholders. I as a shareholder would like to see another option.&quot;    In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Jacobs said he doubted that Gillette could remain independent.    Short of launching his own effort for Gillette -- something that could prove taxing to finance -- Mr. Jacobs has several courses of action. He may seek to put enough pressure on Gillette's management to drive it into the arms of a friendly suitor, boosting the price of its stock in the process. That's what occurred with Borg-Warner Corp., which spurned takeover efforts by Mr. Jacobs and GAF Corp. only to be acquired by an investor group led by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    Or he may call for a special shareholders meeting to consider Gillette's future -- a strategy he employed in seeking to bring about management changes at Walt Disney Productions in 1984. Mr. Jacobs also applied pressure to ITT Corp.'s management by attending its 1985 annual meeting. ITT subsequently announced a significant restructuring, and Mr. Jacobs sold his 4.5% stake for what was believed a tidy profit.    Meanwhile, Mr. Jacobs and Carl Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball team, together have been accumulating a large stake in McGraw-Hill, but it remains under 5%. That is the level at which investors must disclose their holding to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Mr. Jacobs said that while he considers the magazine publisher to be &quot;grossly undervalued,&quot; he indicated willingness to wait and see what the market does in pressuring management there to act. Mr. Jacobs said that to improve its value, McGraw-Hill could either restructure the company or sell the New York concern. &quot;I'm not demanding what they should or shouldn't do,&quot; Mr. Jacobs said.&quot; The marketplace will tell them. That's my assumption.&quot;    He said he's had no conversations with McGraw-Hill and has no plans to initiate contact.    McGraw-Hill didn't have any comment on Mr. Jacobs's position in its stock.    John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that if the company chooses to restructure, its options include a buy-back of stock and sale of its broadcasting operations, which he values at $550 million to $600 million. McGraw-Hill is primarily a publisher of textbooks and periodicals, including Business Week magazine. The company also owns Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., a major credit-rating concern.    In recent months, McGraw-Hill has been the subject of takeover speculation because of rising interest in publishing stocks. It is one of a few large, publicly held publishers, and although the McGraw family controls about 20% of the stock, it is seen as more vulnerable to a takeover than some other family-dominated publishing companies. McGraw-Hill, for example, doesn't have two classes of stock, a system adopted by some publishers to thwart takeovers.    In 1979, McGraw-Hill fought off an acquisition bid by American Express Co. after an unusually acrimonious takeover battle. One of McGraw-Hill's tactics was a public campaign suggesting that the editorial independence of its business periodicals and Standard andamp; Poor's would be threatened if American Express's bid succeeded.    ---   Minstar Acquisition Pact   MINNEAPOLIS -- Minstar Inc. said a definitive agreement was reached on its previously announced acquisition by its majority-owned unit, Genmar Industries Inc.    Minstar, Irwin Jacobs' primary investment vehicle, said the boards of both companies approved the agreement, which has been modified since being announced earlier this month.    The acquisition of Minstar will be made by Genmar through a newly formed holding company, Genmar Holdings Inc.    Under the proposed transaction, in addition to receiving 0.75 share of Genmar Holdings common for each common share of Minstar, Minstar holders will have the option of receiving $23.50 in cash, or $23.50 principal amount of increasing-rate senior notes of Minstar, or any combination of cash and notes totaling that amount.    When the agreement was originally announced, holders were to receive $11 in cash and $12.50 in notes.    Minstar said the purchase is being financed through a $250 million bridge loan and a $180 million five-year term and revolving loan with six banks.    Mr. Jacobs, chairman of both Minstar and Genmar, said it is intended that the increasing-rate notes and the bank bridge financing will be retired by proceeds from the sale of Minstar's Energy and Sports Product Group.    The transaction is subject to approval by holders of both companies. A meeting is expected to be held in November.    Genmar is a boat maker. Minstar is a leisure-products and moving concern. </TEXT></DOC>
