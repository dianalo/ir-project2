The Fed nudged down its target for a key short-terminterest rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4 1/2%, governmentofficials said.</LP><TEXT>   Two hours after the Fed pumped credit into the bankingsystem, Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a speech that &quot;theeconomic recovery, which seemed to be gathering momentum andspark during the summer, more recently has shown signs offaltering.&quot;   Many analysts anticipate another move by the Fed, perhapsas soon as next week when the Fed's policy-making open marketcommittee is scheduled to meet. &quot;My expectation is we'llprobably get further ease from the Fed before the year isover,&quot; said Darwin Beck, an economist who tracks the Fed forFirst Boston Corp.   The latest Fed move -- a cut in the federal funds rate,which banks charge each other on overnight loans -- came onthe heels of the Labor Department report that employerstrimmed their payrolls substantially in November, one of theclearest signs so far of economic weakness.   The bond market reacted to the employment report bybidding down interest rates, in part in enthusiasticanticipation of a Fed easing move. The yield on the benchmark30-year Treasury government bond ended Friday at 7.80%, downfrom 7.82% the day before.   Mr. Greenspan didn't refer specifically to the employmentfigures in his remarks to the Securities Industry Associationmeeting in Boca Raton, Fla., pointing instead to thefinancial factors restraining the economy. He said that &quot;aheavy overhang of debt, an accumulation of bad loans anddoubts about the future have produced an unusual degree ofcaution among many key lenders, as well as on the part ofbusinesses and consumers.&quot;   The Fed chairman also made clear that in his view thevarious technical explanations for the sluggish growth of themoney supply aren't sufficient to justify a standpat Fedpolicy.   &quot;On balance, the extraordinarily slow pace of money anddebt growth, although partly a product of financialrestructuring with only limited implications for the economy,also has indicated that financial conditions have beenconstraining the economy's ability to expand,&quot; he said.   Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has cut thefederal funds rate by more than two percentage points. Whenthe Fed eases its grip on credit, interest rates generallyfall and the growth of the money supply accelerates. Despitethe Fed's action, however, money supply is currently growingat the very bottom of the 2 1/2%-6 1/2% target range that theFed set for itself at the beginning of the year.   The latest Fed move puts the federal funds rate and thehighly visible discount rate, which the Fed charges on loansto financial institutions, at 4 1/2%. Based on past practice,the next Fed move, if there is one, will be to cut thediscount rate by 1/2 percentage point and the federal fundsrate by 1/4 percentage point. Such a move could prompt banksto cut their prime lending rate, which is now at 7 1/2%, thelowest level in more than five years.   The Fed move came about a month after the Fed last acted.At the end of October and beginning of November, it cut thefederal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point in two 1/4-pointinstallments and reduced the discount rate by 1/2 percentagepoint.   The first quarter-point move came just before a meeting ofthe Fed's open market committee and the second cameimmediately afterward. Some analysts anticipate a similarpattern this month.</TEXT></DOC>
