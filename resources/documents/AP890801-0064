Col. William Higgins by Lebanesekidnappers, faces the frustration his predecessors experienced indeciding how to international terrorists, experts say.   One administration source said today that a military responsewas ``in the realm of the possible,'' but that Bush had not decidedon a course of action among the options before him.   ``No one is tilted in that direction,'' the source, who declinedto be identified, said of some sort of armed intervention. ``It'son the menu. No one's ordered it ... We're not leaning necessarilytoward anything. People are discussing the options. We are not atthe specific choosing stage.''   A second official, who also demanded anonymity, said the problemwith a military strike is that some of the U.S. or foreign hostagesare likely being held ``at the sites you might strike'' toretaliate against their terrorist captors.   And he said of a possible rescue attempt, ``most people havethought that's kind of ruled out'' in part because the hostages arebelieved held at different sites by different groups.   ``It's very clear the options are not attractive for the UnitedStates,'' this official, adding that the diplomatic approach seemsthe most viable.   Private analysts note there are no easy answers to America'slatest terrorist challenge.   ``Rhetoric is cheap, but decisive action is difficult. I don'tknow if there is very much we can do in the short term,'' saidGeoffrey Kemp, a former Reagan administration official who worksfor the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   President Reagan pledged at the time of his inaugural more thaneight years ago to take ``swift and effective retribution'' againstterrorists but often backed away from bold action, worried that thecure might be worse than the disease.   He was concerned that the United States might strike at thewrong target, kill innocent civilians and jeopardize the lives ofthe remaining Americans held hostage in Lebanon. With the reporteddeath of Higgins, eight American hostages remain.   According to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Bush told congressionalleaders Monday night that it's a ``98 percent probability'' thatHiggins was slain as his Shiite Moslem captors claimed.   ``The options for retaliation are virtually non-existent,'' saidNoel Koch, a former Pentagon official and terrorism expert.   L. Paul Bremer, who headed the State Department'scounter-terrorism office under Reagan, said Bush's problem has beenthe absence of adequate intelligence from Beirut's shadowyunderworld, where the American hostages are believed held.   He said the administration should not rule out the abduction ofterrorist ringleaders as punishment for Higgins' reported execution.   Very little is known about the group that claimed to have killedHiggins, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.   James Blackwell, deputy director for political military studiesat Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, ``We arereally caught between a rock and a hard place.''   ``The military option is there but it is a limited one,'' hesaid, because the U.S. must avoid hurting innocent people anddoesn't want to harm the other hostages.   Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren, D-Okla.,said after the meeting with congressional leaders that Bush wasconsidering several options but he declined to identify them.   ``I don't think anything has been ruled out at this point,''Boren said.   Complicating the quest for an appropriate response were doubtsabout whether Higgins was killed Monday or months ago. Israeliofficials strongly suspect that Higgins's death may date as farback as July or December 1988.   Higgins' kidnappers maintained the purported execution was inretaliation for the kidnapping by Israeli commandos of Sheik AbdulKarim Obeid, a Lebanese Shiite leader who was seized at his home 72hours before the announced hanging of Higgins.   Shortly before Higgins' execution was reported, Israeliofficials said their government was offering to exchange its ShiiteMoslem captives from Lebanon for Israeli prisoners of war and allforeign hostages held by Shiite groups.   But after the meeting with Bush, Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell, D-Maine, indicated that the president does not considernegotiating with terrorists to be an appropriate option.   Mitchell said Bush ``strongly reaffirmed his belief in theappropriate policy of not negotiating with terrorists in anycircumstances.''</TEXT></DOC>
