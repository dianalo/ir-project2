JamesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BCW NWENTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><TEXT>   Becor Western Inc., already the object of a management-led buyout bid, said it received a $255.8 million acquisition proposal from another investor group.    The $15.50-a-share proposal was made in a letter to South Milwaukee, Wis.-based Becor by Investment Limited Partnership of Greenwich, Conn., and Randolph W. Lenz. Mr. Lenz is chairman of Green Bay, Wis.-based Northwest Engineering Co., which purchased Becor's construction-machinery parts business two years ago.    Analysts said the all-cash bid appeared more attractive than last month's proposal from a management-led group that includes William B. Winter, Becor's president. The management-led group agreed to acquire the mining-machinery and aerospace parts maker for cash and debentures with an indicated value of $238.1 million.    Under the management-led proposal, holders of Becor's 16.5 million common shares outstanding would receive $10.45 in cash and $4 face amount of senior sinking fund debentures for each share. The buyout proposal is contingent on Becor's planned sale of its Western Gear Corp. aerospace unit for $117 million to Lucas Industries PLC of England.    Details regarding the management-led group's financing arrangement and potential response to the latest bid aren't yet clear, analysts said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Becor shares rose 75 cents to close at $15.625.    Norris K. Ekstrom, Becor's chairman, said the company would evaluate the latest bid. Mr. Ekstrom isn't part of the management-led group that made the earlier proposal. The company also said it has received other &quot;expressions of interest,&quot; but declined to be specific.    The new proposal is contingent on Becor receiving at least $110 million in proceeds from the Western Gear sale. It also hinges on the &quot;satisfactory outcome of a due diligence investigation,&quot; in which the potential buyer gets to examine nonpublic corporate data, Becor said.    Becor said it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission preliminary proxy materials for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the Western Gear sale and management-led leveraged buyout proposal. &quot;The first offer is a firm offer,&quot; said Mr. Ekstrom. &quot;We don't know if the new one is firm,&quot; he added.    Andrew Silver, a securities analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said he doesn't expect the latest proposal to result in a bidding war because both bids are at the high end of the company's value.    Analysts have said demand for mining machinery is expected to be flat this year. Helen Walters, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said: &quot;Mining is a tough business. If I were a shareholder of Becor, I'd be happy to get what they (the two bidders) are offering.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
