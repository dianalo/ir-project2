In a method to use Na{sub2}CO{sub 3}, when CO{sub 2} in the waste gas reaches 25% or more, Na{sub2}CO{sub 3} reacts with CO{sub 2} with priority and is converted intoNaHCO{sub 3}, greatly reducing the H{sub 2}S absorbing capacity. In thisinvention, because the temperature of aqueous Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3} solutionis kept above 65{sup 0}C, NaHCO{sub 3} which was formed by the reactionof Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3} and H{sub 2}S regenerates into Na{sub 2}CO{sub3} which efficiently absorb and remove H{sub 2}S. Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3}which thus absorbed H{sub 2}S is then returned into the ground from thereinjection well together with the turbine condensate. (2 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
