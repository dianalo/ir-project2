The Department of the Air Force responded to the Notice onJuly 15, 1988. In its response, the licensee denied one violation, statedthat it can neither admit nor deny that a second violation occurred, andset forth several reasons why in its view the civil penalties should notbe imposed. The NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the licensee'sarguments are as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Violation A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Restatement of Violation A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10 CFR 20.403 (b)(3) and (b)(4) require the licensee to contact theNRC within 24 hours of discovery of an event involving licensed materialpossessed by the licensee that may have caused or threatens to cause aloss of one day or more of the operation of any facility affected, or damageto property in excess of $2,000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Contrary to the above, the licensee failed to notify the NRC within24 hours of discovery of an event involving licensed material possessedby the licensee that may have caused or threatens to cause a loss of oneday or more of the operation of any facility affected, or damage in excessof $2,000. On September 19, 1986, members of Wright-Patterson's Bio-EnvironmentalEngineering Group initially concealed from both NRC and Air Force personnelan americium-241 spill, which occurred on September 18, 1986 in a facilityused as a waste storage area. Although the licensee did contact NRC officialson September 26, 1986, the Air Force did not relay to the NRC accurateinformation, which was known to Brooks Air Force Base, so that the NRCcould make an accurate assessment of the event. Moreover, on October 6,1986 an entry was made into the same facility which resulted in the overexposurecited in Violation B and additional contamination. Nevertheless, neitherthe initial event nor the second event was accurately reported to the NRCuntil November 7, 1986. These events caused the licensee to take actionto prohibit the use of its waste storage area for more than one day andcaused damage to property as demonstrated by the decontamination costsin excess of $2,000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is a Severity Level I violation (Supplement IV) Civil Penalty_$100,000</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Summary of Licensee's Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The license denies that a report was required with regard to the matterswhich occurred on either September 18 or October 6, 1986. In this connection,the licensee argues that the reporting regulation is ambiguous regardingwhat constitutes an ``event,'' ``loss of facility,'' and ``damage to property.''The licensee further argues that the regulation is unenforceably vague,and that there was no need to report the incident since the facility continuedto be used as a storage facility and the costs required for cleanup didnot constitute ``damage.'' The licensee also denies that there was an intentor attempt to deliberately provide inaccurate or incomplete informationto the NRC or to mislead NRC officials with respect to either incidentor an intent to restrict NRC personnel from receiving information germaneto the performance of NRC duties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">NRC's Evaluation of Licensee's Response</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NRC disagrees that the reporting requirements as applied to theseincidents are vague, and maintains that the events which occurred on September18 and October 6, 1986 did indeed constitute events which required 24 hournotification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On August 20, 1986, an NRC Region III (NRC-RIII) special inspectionwas conducted to evaluate allegations by John C. Haynes. The allegationswere that: (1) During a 1972-1974 time period, Haynes transferred an unknownquantity of unencapsulated americium-241 to the Radiation Safety Officer(RSO) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) without the knowledgeof WPAFB management; and (2) the RSO informed Haynes that during the 1972-1974time period, 100 curies of americium-241 were found and transferred tothe Monsanto Corporation of Dayton, Ohio.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During an August 20, 1986 interview, the WPAFB RSO stated that hehad never received any radioactive material for disposal from the allegerand denied that americium-241 was found and transferred to the MonsantoCorporation. The RSO also provided a written statement to NRC inspectorsconfirming his oral statement. The inspectors reviewed waste handling recordsin an attempt to validate the RSO's testimony. No indication was foundof transactions with Mr. Haynes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On September 18, 1986, the RSO, along with other WPAFB personnel,entered Building 4060, a radioactive waste storage building, to conductan inventory. During this entry, an americium-241 release occurred whileopening a barrel to identify its contents. That barrel contained the materialthat had been illegally received from the alleger by the RSO. The entryresulted in personnel contamination that required several showers for decontamination.Both the Director and Deputy Director, WPAFB Bio-Environmental Engineering(BEE) Group, were notified of the event on September 18, 1986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A meeting of the BEE Group took place on September 19, 1986. Duringthat meeting, the event, its reportability, and methods for cleanup werediscussed. The Director, BEE, instructed the other members not to reportthe event to anyone, including other groups in the Air Force. A plan forillicit disposal of the material, consisting of mislabeling waste barrels,was also discussed. When the Director, BEE, learned during the meetingthat the meeting was being tape recorded for the purpose of preparing meetingminutes, he ordered that the portion of the tape dealing with the contaminatonevent be destroyed. Outside the meeting, the Director, BEE, requested theDeputy Director, BEE, to consult with the WPAFB Medical Physicist regardingappropriate followup activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On September 22, 1986, the Deputy Director, BEE, assumed command ofBEE Group as the Director was on temporary duty in St. Louis, Missouri.As instructed that day by the Director, the Deputy Director discussed theevent with the Medical Pysicist for WPAFB Medical Center and asked forhis recommended course of action. The Medical Physicist suggested thatBEE should notify the Base Commander and determine the identity of theisotope. On September 26, 1986, the Medical Physicist realized that theDeputy Director had not made any notifications and had not determined theisotope. The Medical Physicist took it upon himself to identify the isotopeand report the event to the Base Commander and the Medical Center Director.Later that day, it was determined that the isotope was americium-241. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After the Base Commander was briefed on September 26, the Base Commanderinitiated a comprehensive reponse to the event. The following actions weredirected by the Base Commander: (1) Immediately determine if contaminationexisted external to the building; (2) seal the building; (3) cordon offthe area; (4) restrict access to the building; (5) contact the USAF RadioisotopeCommittee by telephone for notification purposes; (6) acquire the use ofthe Air Force Radiological Assistance Team (AFRAT) for cleanup operations;and (7) prepare a suitable decontamination plan for implementation, includingtimes and milestones. It was also directed that the appropriate authoritiesand organizations should be informed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At 3:30 p.m., on September 26, 1986, the Medical Physicist, WPAFBinformed the Executive Secretary of the USAF Radioisotope Committee atBrooks AFB of the problem and the Executive Secretary assured him thatthe required notifications to the NRC would be made. The Executive Secretaryhad been informed by the Medical Physicist that the event was a high-levelspill of radioactive material in a building and that the material was americium-241,but might also include plutonium-239. The Executive Secretary then directeda staff member to inform the NRC Region IV (NRC-RIV) about these facts.Although a telephone call to NRC-RIV was made, the information providedto NRC officials was that the event consisted of leakage of low-level wastedrums and was scheduled to be minor. NRC officials were also told thatthe event was under review and more details would be forthcoming. The identityof the isotope and high-level nature of the spill was not mentioned.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On September 29, 1986, as determined from interviews and the notesof individuals, the Director and Deputy Director of the BEE Group, wereaware of the involvement of Haynes and the illicit nature of the materialthat had been spilled. The Base Commander stated that the number one priorityof WPAFB at that time was the contamination event. Also, on September 29or October 2, 1986, the Executive Secretary briefed his replacement onthe event, as he was reporting to a new duty assignment.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On October 3, 1986, an NRC-RIV official who had been involved in theSeptember 26, 1986, phone call contacted the new Executive Secretary, sinceno further information had been received from NRC. The event was describedby the new Executive Secretary to the NRC official as being minor in nature.He also told the NRC official that the contamination was localized andthere did not appear to be a major problem. At this point, the new ExecutiveSecretary knew that the cleanup operation would cost at least $100,000,yet he did not mention this to the NRC representatives.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another telephone call to NRC-RIV officials was made on October 6,1986. Again, Air Force personnel contacted described the events as minorin nature and did not mention the isotope. Also, on this date, Air Forcehealth physics personnel entered Building 4060 to evaluate radiaton levels.A significant uptake of americium-241 to one individual (8.07 nanocuries)and additional contamination resulted from this entry.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of continuing escalation of the event, the new Executive Secretarydecided to call NRC-RIV on October 10, 1986, and discuss the event in furtherdetail. Although during this telephone call he informed NRC-RIV of theidentity of the material, he did not discuss the extent of the spill andthe amount of money needed to clean up the problem. The NRC-RIV officialasked the new Executive Secretary if NRC reporting requirements had beenreviewed and was told that they had been reviewed and a report was notrequired.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Neither the September 18 nor the October 6, 1986, event was accuratelyreported to the NRC until November 7, 1986, and these events caused theloss of operation of Building 4060 for more than one day and resulted indamage to property, as demonstrated by the decontamination costs, in excessof $2,000. The licensee argues that the storage aspect of the facilitycontinued to be unaffected. NRC disagrees with the licensee's conclusion.Routine use, as understood by NRC, consisted of waste barrels entering,being stored, and exiting the facility. Individuals would enter and exitthe facility with minimal anti-contamination clothing. After the eventsof September 18 and October 6, 1986, the licensee controlled the facilityin the following manner: (1) On Octer 4-5, a security watch was providedto prevent individuals from even approaching Building 4060 and measureswere taken to prevent reentry, and (2) from October 14-23, the licenseehad to order new equipment necessary for reentry. Such equipment was previouslyunnecessary. No barrels were added or removed after the September 18 eventuntil the new equipment necessary for reentry was received.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Barrels were eventually removed in response to the event. The moststriking argument for loss of the facility is the final determination bythe licensee that the building could no longer serve a useful purpose andhad to be destroyed. Although this action occurred some time after theevent, sufficient information immediately following the event demonstratedthat Building 4060's function as intended prior to the event was clearlylost.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, NRC officials were misled by USAF officials. Personnelfrom the Radioisotope Committee did not provide adequate information tothe NRC Region IV office and the Director of BEE, and upper-level baseindividual, instructed his employees not to discuss the event with anyoneoutside the BEE Group. Such actions on the part of the licensee, throughits employees, are unacceptable and were in disregard of the NRC's responsibilityfor public health and safety.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Violation B  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Restatement of Violation B  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10 CFR 20.103(a)(1) limits the quarterly uptake of radioactive materialsin air by individuals in restricted areas to amounts derived from the concentrationlimits in 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix B, Table I, Column I, using the formulain 10 CFR 20.103(a)(1) Footnote 3. The derived quarterly limit for uptakeof soluable americium-241 in air is 3.8 nanocuries. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Contrary to the above, on October 6, 1986, an individual working ina restricted area inhaled or ingested approximately 8.07 nanocuries ofsoluble americium-241.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is a Severity Level III violation (Supplement IV). Civil penalty_$2,500. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Summary of Licensee's Response  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The licensee claims that at the time of its response (July 15, 1988)it could neither admit nor deny that an individual in a restricted areareceived an exposure to radiation in excess of the regulatory limits setforth in 10 CFR 20.103(a)(1). Its basis for making this claim is that anindependent contractor had been obtained by the Air Force to assess bioassaydata for the individual in question and to date the results of the assessmentare pending.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">NRC's Evaluation of Licensee's Response  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NRC conclusion that the individual in question exceeded the regulatorylimits of exposure to americium-241 by a factor of approximately two wasbased on information received from the licensee. Specifically, on December7, 1987, a formal report from the licensee was sent to the NRC statingthat the report was a final summary report of bioassay results. The licensee'sown report stated that the individual did exceed the quarterly MPC limitsby a factor of approximately two. The NRC's review of the data at thattime confirmed the licensee's conclusion. Therefore, based on the informationcurrently available, the NRC maintains that the individual received anexposure to americium-241 in excess of the regulatory limit. If, at sometime in the future, further data are submitted in conflict with this information,the NRC may reevaluate its conclusion. To date, no further assessment datahave been submitted to the NRC.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Summary of Licensee's Arguments for Mitigation or Elimination of theCivil Penalty  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The licensee makes several assertions in support of its argument thatthe civil penalty should be mitigated or eliminated. These can be summarizedas follows: (1) The level of the penalty for Violation A, without considerationof the factors provided in the Enforcement Policy, is arbitrary and capricious;(2) Mr. Lewis, who accepted and stored waste at Wright-Patterson Air ForceBase, acted in a purely personal capacity, and without the knowledge ofhis superiors, and his conduct has never been condoned by the licensee;(3) imposition of civil penalties upon the Air Force would punish the victimof the misconduct, and serve no valid purpose, and it is unfair to theAir Force, previously a highly satisfactory licensee, to term the Air Force``deceptive'' under the ambiguous circumstance which existed; (4) creditshould be given for the licensee's prompt identification and reportingof both events (as soon as management became aware of the events, theywere reported and each significant change in the situation was promptlypassed on the the NRC), corrective action, and exemplary past performance;(5) since Region III failed to inform Region IV or the Radioisotope Committeeof allegations by J.C. Haynes that americium-241 had been delivered toMr. Lewis, the Radioisotope Committee was not sensitive to Region III'sconcern that they could not account for several curies of americium-241,and this contributed to Lewis' having unsupervised access to Building 4060;and (6) the levying of a civil penalty by one federal agency upon anotheris unconstitutional.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">NRC's Evaluation of Licensee's Arguments  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Violation A is Arbitrary and Capricious  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The level of the penalty for Violation A is not arbitrary and capriciousbut is in accordance with the NRC's Enforcement Policy 10 CFR Part 2, AppendixC (Policy). Violation A, the failure to file a report, would normally becategorized at Severity Level III in accordance with Supplement IV.C.3of the Policy. However, that severity level was increased to Severity LevelI pursuant to Section V.B of the Policy which states that ``in cases involvingwillfulness, flagrant NRC-identified violations, repeated poor performancein the area of concern, or serious breakdown in management controls, NRCintends to apply its full enforcement authority where such action is warranted,including issuing appropriate orders and assessing civil penalties forcontinuing violations on a per day basis, up to the statutory limit of$100,000 per violation, per day.'' Thus, the staff concluded that ViolationA involved a willful attempt to conceal these events by a number of USAFpersonnel and that the NRC should exercise its enforcement discretion andincrease the penalty for Violation A to $100,000.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Mr. Lewis Acted in a Purely Personal Capacity  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NRC does not agree that Mr. Lewis acted in his own capacity withoutknowledge of his superiors. Based upon statements made during the NRC investigation,the NRC has determined that Mr. Lewis was accompanied by his superior,now retired Colonel Milner, during the receipt of the material. Furthermore,even if Mr. Lewis had acted alone, as stated in Section V.A of NRC's EnforcementPolicy, the NRC holds licensees responsible for the actions of their employees.This is especially appropriate where the person is the Radiation SafetyOfficer who is responsible for radiation protection. In addition, withrespect to the reporting violation, it is clear that several USAF officialswere responsible for failing to adequately inform NRC.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Imposition of Civil Penalties Upon the USAF Would Punish the Victim</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The failure of USAF officials to provide adequate information to theNRC Region IV office did not involve lower level base personnel, but personnelfrom the Radioisotope Committee. Additionally, on September 19, 1986, theDirector of Bio-Environmental Engineering, an upper-level base individual,when questioned as to the reportability of the September 18 event, statedthat he was not going to inquire as to whether the event necessitated reporting.He also instructed his employees not to discuss the event with anyone outsidethe BEE Group. The Deputy Director, BEE, when instructed to report theevent and determine the isotope, made no attempt to follow such instructions.Individuals at Brooks Air Force Base clearly had information which NRCofficials needed in order to respond properly to the event, but failedto communicate such information to the NRC in a timely fashion. Such actionson the part of the licensee, through its employees, are not acceptableand were in disregard of its and the NRC's responsibility for public healthand safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Credit Should be Given for Reporting, Corrective Actions and PastPerformance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NRC also does not find that the licensee's reporting of the events,corrective actions, or prior performance warrant mitigation of the civilpenalties. With regard to the licensee's reporting of these events, neitherthe September 18 nor the October 6, 1986 event was accurately reportedto the NRC until November 7, 1986. As stated above, the NRC concluded thatViolation A involved a willful attempt to conceal these events by a numberof USAF personnel and it should exercise discretion and escalate the basecivil penalty. In reaching the decision to exercise this discretion, theNRC recognized the licensee's corrective actions and its prior good enforcementhistory. While the Enforcement Policy allows for mitigation of civil penaltiesfor such factors as corrective actions and enforcement history, becauseof the seriousness of this matter, mitigation is not considered appropriatein this case.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Contrary to the licensee's assertion that it kept the NRC appraisedof any changes in the situation, the NRC was not informed that bioassaydata was still being reviewed until the licensee filed its response tothe NOV in July 1988. Until then, the NRC was of the impression until receiptof that response that a final determination had been made of the individual'sexposure. In particular, on December 7, 1987, a formal report from thelicensee was sent to the NRC stating that the report was a <T3>final</T3> (emphasis added) summary report of the bioassay results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Region III Did Not Notify Region IV or the Radioisotope Committeeof the Haynes-Lewis Connection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to the licensee's allegations that Region III did notnotify the Radioisotope Committee of the Haynes-Lewis connection, NRC didnot notify the Committee of the allegations because it did not appear tohave an immediate impact on health and safety. During the Haynes confiscationin 1985, the NRC believed that the majority of the americium-241 in Haynes'possession had been accounted for based on scientific analyses conductedon the confiscated material and estimates from the many radiological surveysconducted. In addition, the NRC believed that the material, if indeed transferred,was in small quantities and had been disposed of through the Air Force.Although the regulatory responsibility for the broad scope license didnot become Region IV's until October 1, 1986, Region III should have advisedRegion IV of the allegations and the subsequent findings. However, hadNRC Region III discussed this matter with Region IV, Region III would havetold Region IV that the majority of the radioactive material had been recovered,but that there were reservations about the RSO's statement concerning whetherhe had received material from Haynes. The NRC had no reason to believethat curie amounts of radioactive material were unaccounted for, as allegedby the United States Air Force.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, NRC believes that it is erroneous to state that the licenseewas not informed of the Haynes-Lewis allegation. During the August 20,1986 inspection prior to the event, NRC inspectors questioned WPAFB officialsabout the allegation. Before the NRC inspectors left the base, they discussedthe matter with high-level base officials. It was clearly understood bythe Deputy Base Civil Engineer, acting for the Base Commander, that NRCwas concerned about the Haynes-Lewis connection and tried to obtain informationto substantiate the allegation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On October 1, 1986, several days after the base commander had beeninformed of the contamination event, the Region III Branch Chief in chargeof the inspectors who performed the August 20, 1986 inspection called todiscuss the inspection. The base commander informed the Branch Chief thatUSAF was, indeed, contemplating further investigation of the allegations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NRC believes that high-level officials at the specific USAF base connectedwith the allegations were adequately informed in advance of the events.It appears that base personnel failed to adequately brief RadioisotopeCommittee personnel about NRC concerns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Imposition of a Civil Penalty by One Federal Agency Upon Another isUnconstitutional</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to the licensee's generalized statement and its March17, 1989 letter to the Department of Justice that imposition of a civilpenalty by one federal agency upon another is unconstitutional, the civilpenalty action taken against the United States Air Force was in accordancewith the NRC's Enforcement Policy which is based on the Atomic Energy Actof 1954. The Act gives NRC the authority to regulate all activities underits jurisdiction in order to protect the public health and safety. TheAtomic Energy Act of 1954 does not differentiate between Federal and privatelicensees in NRC's authority to issue civil penalties. The language ofthe Atomic Energy Act authorizes civil penalties against any ``person,''which is defined to include ``any * * * government agency other than theCommission.  * * *''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Atomic Energy Act in our view is not unconstitutional. The applicabilityof section 234 of the Act to Execute Branch agencies is discussed in somedetail in the letter and memorandum sent by the NRC's General Counsel tothe Department of Justice on April 18, 1989, copies of which were sentto the Air Force's General Counsel. Therefore, consistent with prior NRCenforcement actions regarding other federal agencies and the Atomic EnergyAct, the civil penalty is being imposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">NRC Conclusion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After reviewing the licensee's response to the Notice of Violationand Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty, the NRC staff has concluded thatthe violations occurred as stated in the Notice, and that the licenseehas not provided a basis for mitigation of the civil penalties. Accordingly,a civil penalty in the amount of One Hundred Two Thousand Five HundredDollars ($102,500) should be imposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-14370 Filed 6-15-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7590-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
