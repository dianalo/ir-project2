International Business Machines Corp. grants new mothers leaves of as much as three years with benefits and guarantees their jobs. Merck andamp; Co. has donated land and money for a child-care facility and allows mothers to work at home.    They're among the top 10 of the 60 U.S. companies considered best for working mothers by Working Mother magazine in its October issue.    The magazine said companies were chosen based on salary, advancement opportunity, support for child care, and a benefits package that included maternity leave, parental leave, adoption aid, flexible schedules, part-time work, job sharing and support for care of elderly dependents.

By the year 2000, the Labor Department estimates, 84% of all women of childbearing age will be working.    Here are the top 10 companies, listed alphabetically: Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif.; Beth Israel Hospital, Boston; Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del.; Fel-Pro Inc., Skokie, Ill.; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J.; IBM, Armonk, N.Y.; Merck andamp; Co., Rahway, N.J.; Morrison andamp; Foerster, San Francisco; SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.; and Syntex Corp., Palo Alto, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
