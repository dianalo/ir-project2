 The European Community's (EC) link with Japan isthe weakest of the technology-transfer connections that willdevelop under this system.andP;  Japanese semiconductor vendors havebecome more optimistic about the EC than in the past, but problemsremain with the reciprocity principle and with discriminatory ECrestrictions on Japan.andP;  Reciprocity is not inherently a badprinciple, but tends to result in one-sided judgments.andP;  The EC hasabolished restrictions on 40 out of 131 items.andP;  Standardizationand certification issues impede removal of the other 91.andP;  Japan ispromoting a strengthening of its relationship with the EC and aneffort to become an EC 'insider' through transfer of hightechnology.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Single European marketComputer industryInternational TradeStandardizationForecastingJapan.andM;</DESCRIPT><NOTE>Only Text is presented here;

 By the tri-polar system, I mean the United States(U.S.), the European Community (EC), and Japan.andP;  Japan's population numbers120 million, the U.S.andP;  numbers about 240 million, the EC numbers 320 million.andO;The GNP of Japan [is] $3.8 trillion, the U.S.andP;  $4.8 trillion, and the EC $4.7trillion.andP;  The growth rate of the GNP of the EC from 1986 to 1988 averagedthree percent; the U.S./Japan combined five percent; and Asian countries(ASEAN and NIES) 10 percent growth rate.andP;  With regard to the amount of trade,imports and exports combined, Japan/EC had $58 billion, Japan/U.S.andP;  $129billion, the U.S./EC $168 billion, Japan/Asian $89 billion, [and] U.S./Asian$105 billion.andP;  With regard to the flow of investment, measured in terms ofaccumulated total at the end of the 1988 fiscal year, the flow from Japan tothe U.S.andP;  was $70 billion, from the U.S.andP;  to Japan $6 billion, from Japan tothe EC $30 billion, and from the EC to Japan $3 billion.andP;  So you see that inthis tri-polar system, the Japan/EC link is the weakest.andP;  In terms of theamount of trade, the EC/Japan amount is half of the U.S./Japan and one thirdof the U.S./EC.andP;  Nevertheless, if you compare the trade figures from 1970,you will see that the EC/Japan trade grew by a factor of 14, the U.S./Japantrade grew by a factor of 10, and the U.S./EC grew by a factor of 6.andP;  If youlook at ASEAN and NIES countries, Japanese trade with this region grew by afactor of 14, and U.S.andP;  trade with that region grew by a factor of 17.andM;EURO-OPTIMISM: BASIC JAPANESE VIEW ANDandM;SOME PROBLEMSandM;Regarding the basic Japanese view of the EC, I think we have changed toEuro-optimism from Euro-pessimism.andP;  We hope-that the EC's view of Japan alsochanges from &quot;The Japan Problem&quot; to &quot;The Opportunity Japan.&quot;andP;  We think, giventhe weak link between the EC and Japan, that we should strengthen this link.andO;But in doing so, there are a couple of problems with the EC '92.andP;  The firstwould be the reciprocity principle in the areas of finance, governmentprocurement, and telecommunications.andP;  The principle itself is not wrong orbad, but in actual execution or operation, the judgments tend to be one-sidedand to take somewhat a result-oriented approach.andP;  The Japanese think thatthey should be successful in setting up new international rules togetherthrough the negotiation of the Uruguay Round.andM;The second problem we have is the discriminatory, quantitative restrictionson Japan.andP;  There were 131 items on the list, and the EC abolished 40 items sofar; so we have 91 left.andP;  There are problems of product standardization andcertification and testing.andP;  We think that the process of setting up unifiedcode standards is not transparent, and we are worried that the companiesoutside of the EC--including Japanese firms--may have difficulty in copingquickly with the new standards and so forth.andP;  We also have some apprehensionfor the actual protectionist execution of past anti-dumping regulations.andP;  Andwe have an additional problem of automobile import restrictions.andP;  Weunderstand that the European Commission is now considering a commonautomobile policy, and we are watching carefully and hoping theserestrictions will be abolished.andM;We have a semi-conductor problem.andP;  The European Commission appealed to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on the Japan/U.S.andO;semi-conductor arrangement.andP;  The Japanese presented the compliance measurelast March to the GATT board; but the European Commission started theanti-dumping procedure in July, and the Japanese submitted the undertaking tothe European Commission in August.andP;  We settled it.andM;JAPANESE RESPONSES TOWARD FURTHERandM;COOPERATIONandM;The first point we have been promoting is the strengthening of the trade andinvestment relationship with the EC.andP;  We now face a situation where firmsoutside the EC have undertaken mergers and acquisitions of EC firms.andP;  FromJanuary to September of 1988, U.S.andP;  companies acquired 35 companies; EFTAcompanies acquired 47; New Zealand and Australian companies [acquired] 14;and Japanese companies acquired five.andP;  Other than that, EC countries andJapan have been sponsoring trade fairs and buying and selling missions, whichare called &quot;Opportunity Japan.&quot;andM;The second point is an effort to be an insider of the EC.andP;  Japanese companiesare trying to raise the domestic supporting industries, and they are alsotrying to set up an EC main office and to have EC people as managers.andP;  Theywant to have good corporate citizenship with the local communities.andM;With regard to the transfer of high technology, the Japanese have a specialpolicy of not transferring military technology abroad except to the U.S.andP;  So,there will be no military technology cooperation between Japan and the EC.andO;But the so-called dual-use high technology could be transferred from Japan tothe EC, and there are some EC companies that are interested in Japanesetechnology.andP;  But the European Commission and [its] countries require to startthis technology transfer at the stage of research and development up tomarket level development.andP;  We are responding to that type of request.andM;Historically speaking, at the first stage, Japanese companies exported theirproducts to the EC, and the response by the EC was in some cases anti-dumpingregulations.andP;  Then, Japanese companies started to set up factories in the EC,and the EC countries raised the local content issue and technology transfer.andO;And next, Japanese companies proceeded to mergers and acquisitions anddevelopment of products from the research and development stages up to marketdevelopment.andP;  Now, EC countries have been somewhat worried about theprotection of high technology.andM;The Japanese also believe that we need cooperation between governments.andP;  TheJapanese have been taking part in research and development programs in theEC.andP;  The programs include nuclear fusion, biotechnology, fine chemical, andthe exchange of young researchers.andP;  We have been cooperating in these fourareas.andP;  Other than that, including the U.S., we have been working onso-called human frontier science.andM;At any rate, we think that the unification of the EC market is a historicalnecessity, and we expect that this will contribute not only to therevitalization of Europe, but also to the world economy and to thestrengthening of the Western world as a whole.andP;  To that end, we are firmlyconvinced that EC '92 should be open-ended in reality.andM;EIICHI ONO is currently Minister in Charge of Commerce at the Embassy ofJapan in Washington, D.C.andP;  He has worked in the field of economics since 1963primarily with his government's Ministry of International Trade and Industryand was director of both the Coordination Division for the Japanese DefenseAgency's Systems and Technology Bureau and the General Affairs Division ofthe Small Business Agency in the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry.andP;
