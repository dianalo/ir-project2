Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> SYN </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   A new synthetic hormone controlled endometriosis without the severe side effects of older drug treatments, researchers reported.    Endometriosis is a common, painful gynecological disorder afflicting about 5% of pre-menopausal women and is a major cause of infertility in young women. It occurs when fragments of endometrium, the special tissue that lines the uterus, migrate to other tissues, such as the ovaries, cervix, vagina or large bowel, and begin to grow there.    The new hormone, nafarelin, was developed by Syntex Corp. and is administered as a nasal spray. It is one of a new class of drugs, under development by several drug makers, that temporarily interrupt the pituitary gland's control of the production of female sex hormones and the menstrual cycle.    Known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, this new class of drugs is considered by some hormone specialists as &quot;the most important advance in the hormonal therapy of gynecologic disorders since the development of synthetic estrogens and progestogens,&quot; declared Robert L. Barbieri, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School, in an editorial accompanying the new report. The synthetic estrogens and progestogens are the main constituents of birth control pills and are used in treating a wide variety of menstrual and reproductive disorders.    The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are being tried in endometriosis because the growth of the mislocated tissues seem dependent on the estrogen produced during one phase of the menstrual cycle. Normally, the disorder subsides after menopause when natural estrogen production ceases. The agonists, by suppressing the production of estrogen, create a temporary menopause during the six months or so of treatment.    Until now, endometriosis has been treated either by surgery to remove the mislocated tissues, or with danazol, a synthetic version of a male sex hormone that overpowers the effects of estrogen. Danazol, which is taken by mouth, is produced by Sterling Drug Inc. of New York under the brand name Danocrine.    In the newest report, by researchers from Syntex and 18 American, Canadian and Swedish scientists, 236 women were treated for endometriosis. One-third received the standard danazol treatment while two-thirds received either of two dosage levels of nafarelin via nose spray twice daily.    Both drugs were equally effective in either clearing up the endometriosis or sharply reducing its extent and symptoms in 80% of the patients. Of 149 of the women who subsequently tried to become pregnant, 58 were successful.    The main difference in the two treatments was in the side effects. The hot flashes, headaches and nervousness typical of menopause occurred with both drugs. The women on nafarelin also suffered a decreased libido, nasal irritation and vaginal dryness. The women on danazol, however, suffered weight gain, water retention, muscle aches and showed signs of liver damage.    More important, perhaps, the danazol altered the makeup of the different types of cholesterol in the blood in a way that increases the risk of heart disease. Such cholesterol changes weren't seen in the women taking the nafarelin nose spray.    In his editorial, Harvard's Dr. Barbieri noted that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists also are being tried in male prostate cancer and other prostate conditions, as well as in treating female ovarian cysts, pre-menstrual syndrome and other gynecological conditions.    In addition to Syntex, such companies as Abbott Laboratories in Chicago, Hoechst AG in West Germany, and Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain are believed to be developing versions of the agonists. A spokeswoman for Syntex in Palo Alto, Calif., said Syntex hasn't yet applied for U.S. Food and Drug Administration marketing approval of nafarelin. </TEXT></DOC>
