Penney Co.'s newest lines of women's clothingreplaces zippers with Velcro. Nordstrom Inc. is puttingdiaper-changing tables in men's restrooms in its departmentstores. And Hyatt Hotels Corp. is mulling a price cut toattract more traveling singles.   All of these moves signal changing times as marketersscramble to keep pace with demographic shifts of the 1990s: apopulation that is older and growing more slowly, anincreasing number of minority-group members, and changingfamily structures. Marketers say they can ignore these trendsonly at great peril.</LP><TEXT>   A closer look at the demographic trends:                                                                                                          SLOWER GROWTH: Perhaps the biggest demographic changefacing marketers is also the most basic: Household andpopulation growth are slowing. In the 1980s, the U.S.population grew by 9.8%; that will fall to an estimated 7%growth in the 1990s.   One strategy to offset the slower growth is to instillbrand loyalty at an earlier age. This year, Eastman Kodak Co.will give a 35mm camera to every baby born in its hometown ofRochester, N.Y. And the company now provides some freephotographic materials to elementary-school photographyclubs, rather than just high-school clubs. &quot;We have toestablish an interest earlier than in the past,&quot; says PeterM. Palermo, a Kodak vice president.   Key Centurion, a Charleston, W.Va., bank, is using moredirect mail to entice college students to use the bank'scredit card. The bank hopes they will keep the accounts aftergraduation out of a &quot;sense of gratitude,&quot; says BeverlyMcKinney, marketing director.   But the most obvious counter to slower growth is to findnew markets. One example: Weight Watchers, a unit of H.J.Heinz Co., is targeting more men to increase enrollment atits weight-loss programs. Generally, Weight Watchers' classeshaven't appealed to men because the men &quot;feel threatened by aroomful of women,&quot; says Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, Heinzchairman. So the company is testing such programs as apersonal weight-loss center -- where a person can shed weightprivately rather than in front of dozens of other dieters.                                                                                                          OLDER POPULATION: In 10 years, the median age of the U.S.population will be 36 years old, three years older than it isnow. The big baby-boom generation is hitting middle age, atime when spending peaks for cars, furniture and other goods.And a growing number of people are over the age of 85.   Aging consumers create some obvious product extensions,such as Penney's Easy Dressing clothes, a catalog line ofVelcro-fastened clothing for women with arthritis or otherailments who may have difficulty with zippers or buttons.Sales from the first catalog last year were three timeshigher than expected, Penney says.   General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. are adding&quot;older&quot; features to their cars. Toyota is installing simpleraudio systems with fewer gadgets in its Camry sedans. Some GMcars now offer a &quot;headup display&quot; that flashes vehicle speedand other signals on the front windshield, making them easierto read.   Selling to an older population can be tricky, though,because age is often a state of mind. Indeed, 80% of people40 to 60 years old look and act 15 years younger, accordingto BrainReserve, a New York research firm.   Because so many older people don't act their age, it canbe difficult to understand what they want, especially whenmarketing and advertising plans are developed by youngerpeople. &quot;You have brand managers who are 24 years old saying:`What does a 35-year-old want?'&quot; says John Kaar, ademographics specialist at Procter andamp; Gamble Co. Pandamp;G has acompany newsletter on demographic trends, which coachesyounger troops on the needs of older consumers.   Advertising campaigns increasingly include olderconsumers, but they have miles to go because &quot;Americansociety still has a love affair with youth,&quot; says JudithLanger, president of Langer Associates Inc., a New Yorkmarket-research firm.   Hyatt Resorts, looking to attract more affluent seniors,will soon test several programs, including spas tailored forolder guests. &quot;The key is not treating them like broken-downversions of young people,&quot; says Marc Yanofsky, senior vicepresident marketing for Hyatt Hotels. &quot;These are people withexperience.&quot;                                                                                                          MORE MINORITIES: At the beginning of the 1980s,minority-group members accounted for 20% of the population.By 2010, that is expected to climb to more than 30%.   Many companies have limited their minority-marketingprograms to blacks and Hispanics, the largest non-whitegroups in the U.S. A lot of the growth in those groups hasbeen regional and centered on large cities, making it easierto target markets.   But targeting certain products to minorities can backfire,as seen by last year's crash of Uptown, an RJR Nabisco Inc.menthol cigarette aimed at black smokers. The product nevermade it to market because of pressure from health andreligious groups, which protested the blatant targeting ofblacks by the cigarette maker.   That episode left marketers skittish. &quot;They're being verycautious,&quot; says John Ruf, a principal at New EnglandConsulting, a Westport, Conn., marketing-consulting firm.&quot;There's a real dilemma about what to do.&quot;   Sometimes advertising aimed at minority groups simplytakes into account social or cultural differences. Forinstance, Ford Motor Co.'s advertising stresses the family,more than singles, in ads aimed at Hispanics.   Minority marketing in the next decade probably will beexpanded to other groups, such as the growing Asianpopulation. Asians have been overlooked, perhaps becauseunlike Hispanics, there isn't one common language. Butmarketers will have to focus more on Asians because theirnumbers are &quot;growing fast and their incomes are higher,&quot; saysRoger Blackwell, professor of marketing at Ohio StateUniversity.                                                                                                          CHANGING FAMILY STRUCTURES: The decline of the traditionalhousehold -- one with a father, mother and two or threechildren -- has been one of the prime motivators of marketinginnovations for a couple of decades. Demographers say thatwon't change. They predict that the number of people livingalone -- now about 25% of the population -- will continue torise, as more people are widowed, divorced or just skipmarriage altogether.   Hyatt sees the growing number of singles as a primetarget. The hotel chain figures singles have paid adisproportionate amount for rooms, and it is considering aprogram of special prices for those travelers. &quot;They'vetraditionally gotten a bad deal when traveling,&quot; says Mr.Yanofsky.   Marketers still have to cater to families with children,especially those baby boomers who delayed having childernuntil their late 30s or early 40s. In those and otherhouseholds, there's less time for housework, sopremium-priced convenience products will continue to gainshare. &quot;We're undergoing an enormous compression in thefamily structure and their activities,&quot; Mr. Blackwell says.   These families' values also differ from those of theprevious generation. For instance, their parents may have&quot;looked at the size of a car as key determinants of whetheryou were successful,&quot; says Vince Barabba, executive directorof research and planning at GM and a former director of theCensus Bureau. Now, some consumers shun bigger cars becausethey fear being viewed as &quot;less socially conscious.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
