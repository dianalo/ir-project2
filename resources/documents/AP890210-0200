The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,said the Army made considerable changes in the acquisition strategyfor the light helicopter, or LHX, to reduce development costs from$5.4 billion to $3.9 billion.   ``The Army has chosen a higher risk acquisition strategy that maynot provide decision-makers with critical information _ such asdemonstrated performance and validation of cost estimates _ whenneeded for key decisions,'' the GAO said.   ``This information is pivotal for the LHX program, given theadvanced technology involved and the demonstrated impact of costgrowth on the program's affordability,'' the report said.   The LHX represents the Army's next generation of scout and attackhelicopters and the service envisions having the aircraft replaceits fleet of aging helicopters.   The Army expects the LHX to perform a number of missions,including battlefield reconnaissance, locating and attacking armoredtargets, striking deep against enemy positions and engaging enemyhelicopters in air combat.   The LHX program, begun in 1983, is estimated at more than $40billion.   The report, titled, ``Light Helicopter Program: Risks Facing theProgram Raise Doubts About the Army's Acquisition Strategy,'' saidthe altered strategy eliminates the testing and evaluation ofcompetitive prototypes of the LHX before the Defense Departmentawards a winning contract and full-scale development begins.   This strategy runs counter to Defense Department policy, whichcalls for adequate test and evaluation to establish realisticperformance thresholds and to reduce risk and uncertainty. Inaddition, the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on DefenseManagement recommended in 1986 that a high priority be given tobuilding and testing prototypes.   The Defense Department defines prototypes as ``an original ormodel on which a later item is formed or based.''   The report also said that technical risks still remain, includingthe development of advanced technology such as more advanced threatsensors. The Army also must make additional reductions in the lighthelicopter's empty weight.   The GAO recommends that the department reassess whether the lighthelicopter should receive more research and development funds for anacquisition strategy that matches Pentagon policy.   The Defense Department agreed in principle with the GAO'sconclusions and recommendations, but noted the amount of moneyavailable limits the strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
