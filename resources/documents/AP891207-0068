The program was announced as representatives of the Communistsand opposition opened talks on the country's future.   The Communists held a monopoly on power in East Germany for 40years, but two months of political upheaval have resulted in theloss of its guaranteed leadership role.   On Wednesday, former party leader Egon Krenz stepped down fromhis last official post, the presidency, and was replaced by anon-Communist, Manfred Gerlach, for the first time in the country's40-year history. Gerlach will be president until Parliament choosesa permanent replacement.   Krenz's Politburo and Central Committee resigned Sunday and werereplaced by a 25-member panel of party reformers, who drew up thenew program to be discussed at an emergency party congress Friday.   ``We support free and secret elections as early as possible, ata time to be set jointly by all political forces,'' said the partyprogram, which was published by the official ADN news agency. Itdid not suggest a date for elections.   The program proposed that all ``newly formed democraticpolitical movements and forces'' work together until the elections.That was a reference to opposition movements such as New Forum thathave sprung up in recent weeks.   The program also called for a new consitution and new penal andadministrative codes.   The party newspaper Neues Deutschland has indicated that theCommunists' traditional leadership hierarchy _ the Politburo andCentral Committee _ will be abolished at the congress. Several EastGerman officials have said the Communists plan to change theparty's name to the Socialist Party, as was done in Hungaryrecently.   The 25-member panel conceded the party is ``responsible for thedeepest crisis in the history of the German Democratic Republic''and accused ``a certain circle of party functionaries'' of takingpart in criminal and unregulated actions,'' according to ADN.   ``Only a radical break with (the party's) Stalinist basicstructures can create a new political home for those in our partywho favor a free, just and solidarity-oriented society,'' the panelsaid.   The talks today involved Communist officials and representativesof the main opposition group New Forum and four small politicalparties that had been Communist allies but broke with the party inrecent days.   About 300 demonstrators gathered outside the church where thetalks were going on, demanding the talks be broadened to includeother groups.   A trade union representative complained that labor leaders hadnot been invited to the talks.   Krenz took power Oct. 18 after hard-line leader Erich Honeckerwas forced to resign amid rising calls for reforms. Krenz openedthe country's borders and promised sweeping reforms, but hislong-time association with the Honecker government and growingpressure from the opposition and party ranks finally forced him out.   The upheaval set into motion investigations into abuses of powerby the ousted Communist elite, whose members allegedly exploitedtheir high position to rob public coffers and live lavishlifestyles.   Honecker and others are under house arrest, and criminal probesare under way. Three former Politburo members, including formereconomics czar Guenter Mittag, have been arrested.   Early today, West Berlin police spokesman Helmut Hinz announcedthat Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, a former leading East Germantrade official, was in a West Berlin prison following aninternational manhunt. Schalck-Golodkowski is accused of pocketingmillions of dollars in illegal arms sales.   Groups of demonstrators have been surrounding secret policestations in recent days to prevent former officials from spiritingaway incriminating documents that may be used for investigations offormer leaders.   On Wednesday, the government appealed for ``calm and restraint''after reports of pro-reform activists seizing secret policefacilities in the cities of Leipzig and Gera.   A recently formed citizens action group headquartered in EastBerlin claims numerous officials under probe by an officialinvestigative committee have managed to destroy evidence that couldbe used against them.   ADN reported late Wednesday the suicide of an official who hadbeen caught trying to leave a government building in East Berlin onMonday with two suitcases stuffed with state funds.   The news agency said the man was arrested after trying to removefunds stashed by Schalck-Golodkowski.</TEXT></DOC>
