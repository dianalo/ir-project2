Now the newly naturalized U.S. citizen, who has taken the firstname Eugene from a character in a the novel ``Look Homeward,Angel,'' is bound for the U.S. Naval Academy.   He hopes to become a pilot, a dream since he watched Americanplanes streak over his Saigon home, but says he never consideredjoining the Air Force.   ``The Navy rescued me. If it hadn't been for that destroyer, Iwould probably be dead,'' Nguyen, 20, said in an interview justbefore Independence Day.   After Saigon fell to the communists in 1975, the family moved tothe coastal city of Nha Trang. Nguyen's father, who had served inthe South Vietnamese navy, was sent to a ``re-education'' campintended to indoctrinate him in communist thought. He wasn'treleased until 1982.   He and his father and a brother made several attempts to flee insmall boats. Twice they were turned back by government ships andother times they were chased off the beach by gunfire.   Finally, in September 1983, the father and two sons made it tothe open ocean with 35 other people in a fishing boat, hoping toreach the Philippines. Five days later they were picked up by a U.S.destroyer. Nguyen remembers it well: the U.S.S. Benjamin Stoddard.   ``The flag was what I saw first,'' Nguyen said. ``I don't think Iever saw my father so happy.''   Nguyen's mother, a younger brother and a sister are still in NhaTrang.   The three refugees settled in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross andNguyen started eighth grade, learning English along the way.   He did well at Sequoyah High School, especially in math. He madethe soccer team, worked for the school newspaper and joined the BetaClub, an honor society. This spring, he graduated fourth in hisclass of 350.   But after taking Naval Academy entrance exams, two things stoodin his way: his height _ 5-foot-1}, a quarter-inch shy of the Navyrequirement _ and a mediocre verbal test score.   Nguyen contacted Sens. Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler of Georgia forhelp. Fowler's committee on military academy appointments agreed tomeet with him last November.   ``I was kind of scared about it. If I failed that, I wouldn't getanother chance,'' Nguyen recalled.   Fran Weiss, a Fowler staffer, said the youth's eloquence anddesire to serve the United States swayed committee members intonominating him. ``The story that he told, it moved us,'' she said.In May, Naval Academy officials agreed to approve the appointment.   Nguyen recalled that when he heard the news, ``My head was justexploding. It just went apart.''   Help from Fowler's office also helped Nguyen get a swearing-inscheduled promptly after he first became eligible to become a U.S.citizen last month. On June 23, Nguyen took the oath of allegianceto the United States and gave a speech to the 150 other new citizens.   ``I told them there couldn't be a greater title than the title ofcitizen of the United States,'' he said.   Nguyen becomes a midshipman this month. And he plans to stay inthe Navy beyond the five-year service requirement after he iscommissioned.   ``Somebody picked me out of the ocean, got me here, educated me,and gave me a chance,'' he said. ``This is my country.''</TEXT></DOC>
