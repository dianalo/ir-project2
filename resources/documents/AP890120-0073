Let those people go,'' a former captive said eightyears to the day after he was released by Iran.   ``The release of those hostages would be a magnificent signal,would be something that I think would trigger all manner of thingshere in this new administration,'' said L. Bruce Laingen, who was incharge of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran when it was stormed on Nov. 3,1979.   Laingen recalled during an interview on ABC's ``Good MorningAmerica'' the release of himself and 51 other American hostages onRonald Reagan's inauguration day in 1980 after 444 days of captivity.   But, he said, ``today is not the day to remember us. It's a dayto remember nine Americans who are denied their freedom in Beirut.''   He noted that Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press, has been a captive almost four years, ``farlonger than any of us.'' He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   ``And I would say this morning to those who hold them and tothose governments who can influence them, if they ever wanted tosend a signal to this government at a time of change in the MiddleEast, this is an opportunity. Let those people go.''   Laingen said incoming President Bush ``is not going to makeconcessions to terrorists. But George Bush, like all of us today, Ithink, are open to change in the Middle East.''   President Reagan said Thursday he was frustrated over hisinability to free the American hostages. ``We don't know where theyare,'' he said, but officials were continuing to explore ``quietlyand privately'' how to win their freedom.</TEXT></DOC>
