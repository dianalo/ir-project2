State Family Planning Commission head Peng Peiyun said more than23 million babies will be born in 1989, about 1.18 million morethan in 1988, the official China Daily reported Monday.   Peng, speaking to family planners, said this year's birth ratewill exceed 21 per thousand, and natural population growth 15 perthousand. Last year the birth rate was 20.8 and the growth rate14.2 per thousand.   China's population growth, which reached as high as 33 perthousand in 1963, decreased dramatically when the government in the1970s inaugurated a family planning policy based on one child perfamily.   The natural growth rate fell to 10.8 per thousand in 1984 and11.2 per thousand in 1985. But it has since been rising again aswomen born in the baby boom period of the early 1960s reachchildbearing age and more people in rural areas defy the one-childrule.   A growth rate of 15 per thousand would be the highest since 1975.   China's population, which stood at 540 million when Communistrule began in 1949, hit 1.1 billion in April this year. China hadhoped to keep population down to 1.2 billion at the end of thecentury, but demographers now say it will be closer to 1.3 billion,about one-fifth of the world's people.   ``One must keep a sober mind over the country's seriouspopulation issue and make greater efforts to publicize theimportance of family planning,'' Peng said.   She said programs had fallen short in rural areas, where thereinstitution of family farming under China's economic reforms hasencouraged farmers to have more children to help in the fields.   Affluent farmers also are able to pay fines imposed for havingmore than one child, and many rural areas, bowing to the strongdesire for sons to carry on the family name, are allowing farmerswhose first child is a girl to try again.   Peng said better publicity and education are needed at thegrassroots level, especially in areas where poverty is high, sayingsuch methods work better than tough policies and fines.</TEXT></DOC>
