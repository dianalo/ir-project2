Firm positions are taken in the massive new Oxford Shakespeare, formally called &quot;William Shakespeare: The Complete Works&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1482 pages, $45, illustrated), general editors, Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor. The editors have no truck with theories about the plays being written by anyone other than the &quot;Sweet Swan of Avon&quot; (Ben Jonson's words), the son of a respectable tradesman and town officer of Stratford. Questions of authorship apply only to a few possible or probable collaborations.    There is a one-page &quot;Brief Account&quot; of a lost comedy, &quot;Love's Labours Won.&quot; Also, we find a single-page &quot;Short Account&quot; of the lost &quot;Cardenio,&quot; called a tragicomedy. The latter might have been a collaboration with John Fletcher. Both plays have only feeble claims to be listed in the Shakespearean canon.    There is also the full play &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen,&quot; upon which Shakespeare is given second billing as collaborator to John Fletcher. On &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (in this volume entitled &quot;All is True&quot;), Fletcher is given second billing. The text of &quot;Pericles&quot; is called &quot;reconstructed,&quot; with second billing given to a distinctly minor writer, George Wilkins, who may have been, among other occupations, a brothel keeper.    The familiar text of &quot;Macbeth&quot; is said to be &quot;adapted by Thomas Middleton.&quot; A page of comment plus a single leaf of dialogue is devoted to &quot;passages attributed to Shakespeare&quot; in a play, &quot;Sir Thomas More.&quot; Five pages of &quot;Various Poems&quot; include unfamiliar short verses attributed to Shakespeare, together with &quot;The Phoenix and the Turtle&quot; and poems from &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim,&quot; a collection not considered to be entirely his. Of course the &quot;Sonnets,&quot; &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; are in the book.    An excellent general introduction gives compactly comprehensive historical, biographical and textual information. A preface of a single page or less accompanies each play. There is a glossary, and for the &quot;Sonnets&quot; an index of first lines. Otherwise there are no notes. The reader finds an uncluttered two-column page, the open, clear typography leaving good space between the lines. My only surly complaint is that it is about as comfortable to hold on one's lap as a pulpit Bible. It is best read at a desk.    Uniquely, it includes two complete texts for what was called in the first quarto &quot;The History of King Lear&quot; and in the folio &quot;The Tragedy of King Lear.&quot; There are considerable differences. The editors say the commonly accepted text of &quot;Lear&quot; is a &quot;conflation,&quot; a blending of the two. They believe the two forms represent Shakespeare's original text, prior to performance, and his own revision into a &quot;more obviously theatrical text.&quot; Anyone devoted to that great play will enjoy comparing them.    ---   Recent additions to The Library of America offer works by Frank Norris and Willa Cather. &quot;Norris: Novels and Essays,&quot; 1252 pages, edited by Donald Pizer, presents &quot;Vandover and the Brute&quot; (written in 1895 but published posthumously in 1914), &quot;McTeague&quot; (1899) and &quot;The Octopus&quot; (not a sea critter, but the railroads, 1901). There are also 22 brief essays.    Like his contemporaries Jack London and Stephen Crane, both of whom were better writers, Norris (1870-1902) was among America's early realistic -- some would prefer naturalistic -- novelists. He believed in a mishmash of environmental, economic, so-called &quot;scientific&quot; determinisms. He is often compared to Emile Zola, who influenced him. In an essay, &quot;Zola as a Romantic Writer,&quot; Norris argues paradoxically, &quot;Naturalism, as understood by Zola, is but a form of romanticism. . . . The world of M. Zola is a world of big things; the enormous, the formidable, the terrible, is what counts.&quot; The comment fits Norris's own novels. Call them socialist romanticism.    The essays are the book's most revealing part. Yet the novels have raw force and can be grouped with some by London, Crane, Theodore Dreiser and Upton Sinclair. Norris died of peritonitis at 32. Given a longer life he might have been a larger literary figure. Even so, Stephen Crane, who died of tuberculosis at only 29, was a finer writer.    The reputation of Willa Cather (1873-1947) rises steadily. &quot;Cather: Early Novels and Stories,&quot; 1338 pages, contains &quot;The Troll Garden&quot; (seven stories, 1905), and the novels &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; (1913), &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; (1915), &quot;My Antonia&quot; (1918) and &quot;One of Ours&quot; (1922). Although the last won her a Pulitzer Prize it is not the best of these excellent books. &quot;My Antonia,&quot; and &quot;O Pioneers!&quot; two of her powerful portraits of strong women, stand near the top of her achievement. Sharon O'Brien, a biographer of Cather, edited the volume and wrote the concise chronology, which is highly interesting. Another volume of Cather is scheduled.    The Norris and Cather volumes are available at $21.95 each by subscription from The Library of America, 14 E. 60th St., N.Y., N.Y. 10022, or at $27.50 each in bookstores. </TEXT></DOC>
