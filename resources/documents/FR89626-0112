The finding is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 105c(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, providesfor an antitrust review of an application for an operating license if theCommission determines that significant changes in the licensee's activitiesor proposed activities have occurred subsequent to the previous constructionpermit review. The Commission has delegated the authority to make the ``significantchange'' determination to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.Based upon an examination of the events since the issuance of the ComanchePeak Steam Electric Station construction permits to TU Electric Co., <T3>et al.,</T3> and the consummation of the settlement agreement beforethe Commission, the staffs of the Policy Development and Technical SupportBranch, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and the Office of the GeneralCounsel, hereafter referred to as ``staff'', have jointly concluded, afterconsultation with the Department of Justice, that the changes that haveoccurred since the construction permit review are not of the nature torequire a second antitrust review at the operating license stage of theapplication.</ITAG>In reaching this conclusion, the staff considered the structure of theelectric utility industry in northeastern and north central Texas, theevents relevant to the Comanche Peak construction permit review and theantitrust settlement subsequent to the construction permit review.The conclusion of the staff analysis is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to the antitrust settlement agreement before the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC), competition for the purchase or sale of power and energyand related ancillary services in the Texas bulk power market was primarilylimited to intrastate power transactions. This intrastate power networkhas remained intact for many years_notwithstanding the fact that some powerentities doing business on the perimeter of the state of Texas as wellas some systems within the state have expressed interest in interstatebulk power transactions for a number of years. Although the Texas bulkpower market has remained primarily intrastate in nature, there have beenseveral changes since the NRC settlement in 1980 that have provided competitivestimuli to this market.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change that has had the greatest impact in the Texas bulk powermarket has been the implementation of the joint settlement agreement, i.e.,before the NRC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This settlementagreement required TU Electric, <T3>et al.</T3>, to make their transmission facilities more available topower systems in Texas and thereby promote competition between intrastateand interstate power systems with the construction of two DC transmissionlines. Although both of the direct current (DC) transmission ties withthe Southwest Power Pool (SWPP) have not been completed, the North tiehas been completed and the Central and South West operating systems areexchanging power and energy over this tie. Plans have been developed toexpand the North tie (as contemplated in the settlement agreement) to accommodatea significant power transfer by a Texas co-generating entity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Capacity (15 percent) in both DC interties has been reserved for non-ownerswho wish to engage in firm power transactions in the interstate market.Moreover, wheeling to, from or over the DC interties is now an availableoption to many power systems in Texas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To remedy a growing need to redistribute power from co-generatorsconcentrated in industrialized pockets in the state, the Texas Public UtilityCommission promulgated rules requiring mandatory transmission or wheelingof co-generated power in Texas. These rules have enabled corporate entities,which heretofore have not participated in the Texas bulk power market,to market their by-product power and energy, i.e., barriers to entry intothe production and sale of bulk power in Texas have been lowered as a resultof the newly adopted wheeling rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Increased coordination and cooperation among bulk power suppliershas resulted in a more open market in the state of Texas. TU Electric hasimplemented numerous transmission and scheduling agreements which haveenabled a variety of power systems to shop for alternative power throughoutthe northern portion of the state.*<NOTE/> Moreover, a computer controlled bulletin board, advisingall members of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) of availablepower and energy in the state is now in place, making ``shopping'' forpower and energy easier for more power systems in the state_thereby enablingpower systems to better meet the individual needs of their customers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>*Although there have been allegations made recently by anelectric cooperative power system in TU Electric's service area that TUElectric has not provided transmission and coordination services upon request,staff believes, in light of the Commission's <T3>Summer</T3> decision, that the issues raised by the cooperative arenot germane to the Commission's ``significant change'' review, but maybe more appropriately addressed in the context of a compliance proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="21">All types of power entities in Texas, i.e., municipal, cooperativeand investor owned, are beginning to explore joint generation projectsboth within and outside the state. The concept of interstate planning andparticipation in interstate power projects is a new one for most Texaspower entities. Although the movement to interstate cooperation and competitionis still in its embryonic stages in Texas, this movement was contemplatedby and provided for in the antitrust settlement agreement before both theNuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.(The settlement agreement provides for requests for capacity increasesand ownership purchases in the DC interties at intervals of every 3 yearsbeginning in June of 1986 and lasting until June of 2004.) It is anticipatedthat this movement toward increased cooperation and competition will continueamong intrastate power systems within Texas and also between intrastatepower systems wishing to engage in joint power supply planning and powersupply transaction across state borders. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although there are still physical impediments to complete synchronousoperations between most Texas power entities and systems outside of Texas,i.e., there are no major alternating current interconnections between ERCOTand the SWPP, the settlement agreement provided power systems inside ofTexas, as well as in surrounding states, the opportunity to exchange powerand energy and engage in bulk power transactions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The staff views the settlement agreement as a major first step inopening up power supply options to a broad spectrum of power entities inERCOT and the SWPP. The staff's analysis of the changes in the licensees'activities since the antitrust settlement has not identified any changedactivity envisioned by the Commission as set forth in its <T3>Summer</T3> decision. Consequently, the staff recommends that no affirmativesignificant change determination be made pursuant to the application foran operating license for Unit 1 of the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station.</ITAG>Based upon the staff analysis, it is my finding that there have been no``significant changes'' in the licensees' activities or proposed activitiessince the completion of the previous antitrust review. Signed on June 16, 1989 by Thomas E. Murley, Director of the Office ofNuclear Reactor Regulation.
