Carlucci onSaturday wrapped up his visit to China, leaving the Chinese happyabout a U.S. decision that could permit Chinese rockets to launchU.S. satellites.   Carlucci also said he was satisfied that the Chinese wouldexercise prudence in their arms sales to the Middle East and otherareas of the world.   Carlucci said he conveyed the U.S. decision about satellites toNational Defense Minister Qin Jiwei.   ``He was most pleased with that,'' Carlucci told reporters atthe Wusong Naval Facility in Shanghai.   The Reagan administration on Friday announced it would giveexport licenses for satellites manufactured by Hughes Aircraft thatare scheduled to be launched for Australian and Hong Kong companieswith China's Long March rocket.   The decision must be approved by the U.S. Congress and a groupof Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers.   Hong Kong-based AsiaSat is to put a satellite in orbit nextyear, while AusSat from Australia will launch two satellites in1991 and 1992 using the Chinese service.   Carlucci said he had recommended to Washington that the licensesbe approved.   The settling of the satellite issue was the second major area offriction solved during Carlucci's first trip to China.   In Beijing, on Thursday, he told a news conference that he was``fully satisfied'' with China's statement that it would exerciseprudence in its arms sales to the Middle East and other areas ofthe world.   Carlucci and Defense Department officials did not elaborate.   He said his talks were ``the best discussions we've had'' on thesubject.   The United States was concerned that Chinese sales ofmedium-range missiles to Saudi Arabia and proposed sales to otherMiddle East countries would upset the regional military balance.   Qin Jiwei told reporters that Chinese arms sales were smallcompared to those of the United States and were carried outresponsibly.   Carlucci was led by navy Cmdr. Zhang Lianzhong on a 50-minutetour of the Wusong base. He called the visit ``a sign of efforts tohave exchanges with the entire range of the Chinese military.''   The defense secretary left after the tour for a flight to HongKong.</TEXT></DOC>
