Police also said the one-day show was ``activity incompatiblewith your status as journalists,'' said Jaime Florcruz, presidentof the Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing.   Florcruz, a reporter for Time magazine, said three uniformedpolice officers and a plainclothes officer gave the artists 40minutes to remove their oil paintings from a room at the Great WallSheraton, a U.S.-China joint venture hotel.   The Correspondents Club was allowed to hold a show in 1988 atthe hotel as a way for journalists to meet young artists.   However, freedom of expression for artists, writers and othershas been strictly limited since the June crackdown on thepro-democracy movement here.   ``Everyone is just flexing their muscles during martial law,''said Meg Maggio, also a Time staffer and the organizer ofSaturday's exhibition of 40 works by six artists.   She said police ``never looked at the paintings.'' Many wereavant-garde or abstract but did not appear to carry politicalmessages.   Ms. Maggio said she was aware that under martial law, in effectin Beijing since May, the club needed authorization for theexhibit. But, she said, ``there is no procedure. We didn't know howto get permission.''   Florcruz said he called the Beijing Cultural Bureau on Fridaybut was not told how to obtain the needed authorization.   He said he told police the paintings were not for sale and therewould be no commercial activity at the exhibit. The policeresponded, ``There's no room for discussion,'' he said.   In November, the Ministry of Culture forced the French Embassyto cancel a nine-day exhibit of the works of a 28-year-old Chineseartist.   ``We were told that foreign embassies are not allowed to sponsorexhibitions by artists _ whether singers, painters, whatever,'' aFrench Embassy official said on condition of anonymity.   Culture Ministry officials told French diplomats at the timethat the ministry planned to distribute a circular informingembassies of the policy. Several embassies said they had notreceived such a notice.   Since the military marched on Beijing June 3-4 and crushed thestudent-led pro-democracy movement, writers have been told theymust discard ``bourgeois liberal tendencies'' and produce works insupport of socialist ideas.   Film directors who had done works about the darker aspects oflife in China have stopped directing or have returned togovernment-sanctioned films.   Most of the young artists who a year ago astonished the nationwith the first public shows of nude and avant-garde works have goneunderground. Artists can earn little or no money for their worksdomestically and those who once sought foreign buyers have beencensured.   The official China Daily on Saturday criticized some art storesand individuals who ``manage artwork sales without licenses, doingillicit trade in black markets or profiteering through undergroundchannels.''</TEXT></DOC>
