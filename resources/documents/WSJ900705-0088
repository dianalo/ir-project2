The move is designed to compensate top-level employeesbecause they didn't get their customary cash bonuses thisyear, even though Chrysler had $22 million in its executivebonus pool. Chrysler's contract with the United Auto Workersunion prevents the company from paying executive bonuses foryears, such as 1989, when rank-and-file workers don't getprofit-sharing payments.</LP><TEXT>   Omitting bonuses placated the UAW but angered high-levelmanagers, many of whom get half their total compensation fromthe bonus. In the first quarter of 1990, turnover of&quot;bonus-level&quot; employees hit three times the normal level, aChrysler spokesman said.   &quot;Part of the problem is that they didn't get a bonus,&quot; thespokesman said. &quot;All of a sudden the total compensationpackage became noncompetitive, and you had people looking.&quot;   Chrysler wouldn't disclose how much stock it had set asidefor the executives. But the company said all its topexecutives, including Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, were awardedshares. Executives will get the stock in January with norestrictions on its sale.   Three top executives -- including Vice Chairman GeraldGreenwald -- have either resigned or announced plans to leavethe struggling auto maker in recent months. Pay was a keyfactor in only one of those departures: that of Michael N.Hammes, who resigned as vice president of internationaloperations to take a top job with Black andamp; Decker Corp.   But taking a de facto pay cut has caused a surge indefections among middle- and upper-middle managers who areeligible for bonuses. Many of these people were angry becausetop management had repeatedly promised them some sort ofbonus, albeit reduced from prior years, sources inside thecompany said.   Chrysler's bonus formula assigns a 20% weighting toprofits and another 20% weighting to market share -- twoareas where the company fell well short of its goals.However, another 20% depends on &quot;customer satisfaction&quot; and40% depends on vehicle quality. The idea is to inducemanagers to focus on more than short-term profits.   Chrysler met its customer satisfaction and quality goalslast year. But net income dropped 66% to $359 million, or$1.55 a share, not enough to permit profit-sharing under theformula agreed on with the UAW.   The union, which had praised Chrysler's earlierwithholding of cash bonuses, criticized the stock awards ascreating a loophole in the contract. &quot;In this day, when we'resupposed to be a team against competition, that esprit decorps is only in the board room, it does not extend to theshop floor,&quot; said Aaron Taylor, president of UAW Local 7,which represents workers idled by the closing of Chrysler'sJefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday,Chrysler closed at $15.50, unchanged.   A year ago, Chrysler announced a $1 billion cost-cuttingprogram (later raised to $1.5 billion) that included an 8%reduction in the white-collar ranks by the end of 1989. Alongwith that, Chrysler announced a &quot;voluntary&quot; program in whichexecutives could &quot;bet&quot; on Chrysler's performance bytransferring as much as 10% of their salary to a specialescrow account.</TEXT></DOC>
