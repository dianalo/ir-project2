ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gold prices soared past $400 an ounce Tuesday,crossing that psychologically important barrier for the first timesince late January.   Meanwhile, the dollar fell sharply amid speculation thatinterest rates might rise in West Germany.   Gold prices have been inching upward in recent weeks, but whenthey crossed the $400 a troy ounce level Tuesday, buyersenthusiastically began to snap up the metal.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of goldsurged $5.50 to $403.70, while Republic National Bank quoted a latebid of $403.50 for a troy ounce, also up $5.50 from late Monday.   ``Gold and silver all of a sudden are back in favor,'' saidSteven Pepper, a precious metals analyst with Republic.   Silver picked up 14.6 cents to close at $5.834 a troy ounce onthe Commodity Exchange, although it fell earlier in London to alate bid price of $5.71 a troy ounce from late Monday's $5.74.   In earlier overseas trading, dealers said gold benefited fromthe dollar's fall and from the turmoil in Eastern Europe.   Gold jumped more than $6 in London to a late bid price of$402.75 a troy ounce, compared with $396.50 bid late Monday, and inZurich, the metal rose to a bid of $399 from late Monday's $396.65.   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.21 to close at a bid $398.61 a troyounce.   The dollar slumped as speculation grew that West Germany'scentral bank, the Bundesbank, would be forced to raise interestrates because the influx of East Germans into the country mightboost economic growth.   When foreign interest rates rise and U.S. rates do not keeppace, the dollar becomes less attractive to overseas investors.Speculation that interest rates might go up abroad often sparksselling of the U.S. currency.   Overseas, the dollar reached its lowest level since lateFebruary against the West German, French, Dutch and Italiancurrencies. In New York, its tone was stronger because the domesticmarket was reluctant to turn bearish on the U.S. currency, saidLinda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical New York Capital MarketsGroup.   However, the dollar still suffered sharp losses on domesticmarkets. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday'sprices, included: 1.81375 West German marks, down from 1.8338;1.6130 Swiss francs, down from 1.62975; 6.1775 French francs, downfrom 6.2435; 1,336.00 Italian lire, down from 1,350.00; and 1.16995Canadian dollars, down from 1.17105.
