Scientists call it the &quot;Black Hole,&quot; so slim are the chances they will ever learn the secrets within.    Once computer tapes are stored in the dark, cool caverns of the Washington National Records Center, stacked among three million cartons of federal documents, they are seldom seen again. &quot;There's a lot of science in there,&quot; says Lloyd A. Treinish, a computer scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center here. &quot;Most of it never gets touched.&quot;    The U.S. has spent billions on space exploration the past two decades, searching out the secrets of the moon and Venus, of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn and galaxies beyond. But the little-known secret is that scientists have looked at only 10% of the data that spacecraft have sent back to earth. They have closely analyzed only 1% of the mountain of tape.    The rest ends up at places like the Black Hole, stored in what some scientists derisively call &quot;tape landfills.&quot; About 73,000 tapes are stacked in the records center, which spans an area the size of 18 football fields. Hundreds of thousands more fill labs across the U.S. The space agency isn't even sure how many tapes it has; over 60% haven't even been located or cataloged.    Science, in other words, has a problem. Big-bucks technology, great at gathering raw data, isn't good at making use of what it gathers. The power of high-tech equipment to spew out billions of &quot;bits&quot; of information has outrun software's ability to make sense of it all. There aren't adequate tools available to sift through huge amounts of information, pick out what is important and translate it into useful pictures and graphs.    &quot;It's a crisis situation,&quot; says Robert S. Wolff, an astrophysicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. &quot;What are we doing spending all sorts of money on new equipment to produce this data when we have no way of handling it?&quot;    Taxpayers &quot;ought to be miffed the government is spending billions on data&quot; that never get analyzed, says Thomas A. DeFanti, who directs a lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago and was part of a committee of scientists who recently studied the problem. What's more, the crisis will soon worsen exponentially when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration starts collecting huge amounts of new data a few years from now.    The mismatch between raw data and real analysis, worst in space science, also shows up in energy exploration, aircraft design, medical imaging, engineering and other fields. &quot;Everybody has the same problem, NASA's just ahead of the rest,&quot; says Mr. Treinish.    No one knows for sure what secrets go undiscovered in the data glut. Researchers use intuition to skim off what they think is the best 1% -- but they aren't certain. Some say important discoveries are lost.    In 1986, for example, scientists grew alarmed after a team at the South Pole took readings overhead and learned the &quot;hole&quot; in the earth's ozone was getting worse. Two dozen countries have since agreed to curb use of some chemicals that deplete the ozone layer, which screens out radiation harmful to people, crops and livestock.    But it turns out action could have been taken perhaps a decade sooner. The hole in the ozone, which appears every spring over Antarctica, showed up 10 years ago in raw data from the Nimbus 7 satellite. Yet no one ever sifted it out of the tangle of tape.    The reason: Scientists had a blind spot. The tapes of satellite data don't show pictures of the globe and the ozone. They instead hold millions of numbers, from 0 to 255, rating the brightness of sun rays reflected off various parts of the ozone layer. Fancy graphics software would have let scientists translate the numbers into a picture of the globe and the ozone's varying thickness, spinning the image around to see the hole hidden at the South Pole.    &quot;It's been in our archive for years. How come they discovered it only last year?&quot; asks a frustrated James L. Green, the head of NASA's National Space Science Data Center, which has the primary job of making sense of the data morass. &quot;It's one of probably hundreds of important discoveries we have sitting in the basement.&quot;    Learning exactly what is in the basement through better analysis of old computer tapes is more critical now than ever. That's because NASA has sharply scaled back plans for all sorts of future missions since the January 1986 explosion of the shuttle Challenger. The way things look now, says Mr. Green, &quot;NASA isn't going to be flying missions to some of these places ever again, at least not in my lifetime.&quot;    Mr. Green is mounting what he calls a &quot;rescue mission&quot; to recover and analyze old tapes and to prepare for the future. But he admits NASA probably will never catch up and says long-term solutions are a long way off. He says scientists must try anyway if they are to &quot;survive what's going to happen next. NASA's going to dump a tremendous amount of data on us.&quot;    Indeed, in the five years between 1990 and 1995, spacecraft will churn out as much information as they did in the previous two decades. After that, the volume will double every two years. The single biggest source of the avalanche will be the multibillion-dollar space station, a football-field-sized laboratory NASA plans to launch into orbit in the mid-1990s. The space lab will send down raw data in amounts never before imagined: 10 trillion bits every day. That's enough to fill 5,000 laser disks daily (each disk can hold a complete set of encyclopedias) or a computer tape long enough to wrap around the earth.    Yet little progress has been made to brace for the onslaught. A recent report by the General Accounting Office says NASA &quot;still lacks an overall vision&quot; of what it needs to handle the coming data explosion. It says that NASA lags five to 15 years in leading-edge technology, that its efforts to prepare for the overload &quot;may not go far enough,&quot; and that it may lack needed equipment. NASA responded that it is studying the problem.    Only in the past few years has new technology, in the form of sophisticated software, high-detail screens and more powerful computers, advanced to the point that it can handle huge sets of raw data. But space scientists doubt they will get the money for these things. Congress, they argue, is quick to spend billions on the gear that spits out numbers ($1.2 billion for Voyager, for example, $2 billion for Viking, and $14.6 billion to develop the space station). Big pieces of iron such as spaceships and satellites create good publicity and thousands of jobs. Software, on the other hand, doesn't rank very high on the glitz index, the scientists contend.    &quot;You tell Congress we're racing against the Russians and they will fund a space telescope,&quot; says Barry E. Jacobs, a NASA data-base expert. &quot;But if we say we have this warehouse and we want to dust off old tapes, they're not interested. It isn't sexy enough.&quot;    NASA scientists have a tough time convincing even their own bosses that a problem exists. In NASA's annual $7.8 billion budget, only $2 million or so is earmarked for new software techniques, studied mainly at the data center based at Goddard. &quot;This is peanuts,&quot; contends William J. Campbell, who heads an artificial-intelligence project at the center. &quot;There is a perception at the highest levels that there isn't a problem. And there is.&quot;    Just as technological advances created the data crunch, they offer a way out. One solution: &quot;visualization,&quot; turning numerical readings on, say, the magnetic field of Uranus into revealing graphs and video simulations. Computers think in numbers, but people comprehend pictures more easily. An on-screen image can, at a quick glance, draw the eye to an unusual spike of red or dash of blue, revealing patterns that numbers need thousands of rows to show.    Business software has for years converted figures into graphs. But science problems use billions of calculations, a daunting load for graphics technology. Even though computers can now process huge amounts of data, the science market has proved too fragmented for computer makers to come up with a few basic graphics systems that can be used in all research fields.    &quot;Science is outrunning tools it can get off the shelf,&quot; says Laurin Herr of Pacific Interface, a consulting firm. He believes government needs to stimulate this part of the market by vastly increasing financing for software development.    Still, given recent advances, computer graphics systems in science are slowly becoming more available -- and affordable. &quot;When it finally moves out to every science, it will be a whole new era,&quot; says Sylvie Rueff, who works with graphics star James F. Blinn at the graphics lab at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.    She and Mr. Blinn, for instance, found surprising details on the behavior of Uranus's magnetic field by turning a physicist's equations into a video. It shows Uranus spinning on its side and encircled by magnetic-wave lines, squiggling like a bouncing octopus.    Elsewhere at JPL, a team working with Mr. Wolff, the astrophysicist, experiments with data that map the terrain of Miranda, a Uranus moon. The group has produced a color video -- &quot;Miranda: The Movie&quot; -- that takes the viewer on an imaginary ride, zooming along accurately placed cliffs and craters as if in a spaceship. Other researchers at JPL are translating raw data into pictures and videos depicting smog patterns over Los Angeles, the formation of clouds and storms, and the swirling of the jetstream.    At the NASA data center, a thin staff works on a skinny budget to develop experimental graphics and data-sifting tools in a belated attempt to save the agency from smothering in computer tape.    Lloyd Treinish, the computer scientist who strolled in amazement among the cartons at the Black Hole, has come up with eight generic ways to visualize data -- no matter what the topic. His multi-color graphs and three-dimensional images track the movement of the ozone hole over the South Pole, how aurora light flashes and other phenomena recorded on the ground and above the earth.    High-tech library science also holds some hope for the beleaguered space scientists. Data-base expert Barry Jacobs is developing an electronic catalog of tapes that better describes their contents so scientists can sift out what they want. Right now, finding old tapes is a nightmare. They are listed in a catalog thousands of pages long, and scientists can't tell what the reels hold without examining them. It also takes the data center weeks to mail out requested tapes.    But Mr. Jacobs's effort is a mission impossible. Only 1% of the tapes have been cataloged so far, and his project can afford to focus on only a slice of the newest data. He says most of the tapes gathered in the past two decades of space exploration may never get logged into the new electronic catalog.    Hence, while efforts like his are crucial, NASA scientists are nonetheless fighting a sense of futility. Current spacecraft continue to send down ever more data and upcoming projects promise to unleash a new flood. &quot;At the same time we're making progress,&quot; Mr. Treinish says resignedly, &quot;we're falling farther and farther behind.&quot;    ---                  NASA's Data Avalanche   NASA's data-gathering technology is outstripping the ability to analyze the data.
