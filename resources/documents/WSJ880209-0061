In fact, only &quot;immediate, firm policy intervention&quot; can overcome the deficiencies in the yearlong program and enable it to reach its goals, Doris M. Meissner, the 1981-82 acting commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in a study released yesterday.    Providing amnesty for longtime illegal residents was a key compromise in Congress' acrimonious, 10-year debate over how to stem the flow of illegal immigration while preserving the nation's immigrant heritage. Besides offering amnesty to illegal immigrants, the 1986 law established the first federal fines against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.    Ms. Meissner's report, published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called attention to the disappointing results to date. Thus far, 1.2 million immigrants have come forward for legalization, with one-fifth of them applying under a separate amnesty program for farm workers. Anywhere from 1.8 million to 2.6 million immigrants are estimated to be eligible for the general amnesty program, according to the report. The report estimates that 1.3 million to 1.4 million immigrants will ultimately apply for the general legalization program, while twice that number will remain illegal.    By trying to reach illegals through the mass media rather than through churches, employers and other groups, the INS's public-information campaign was &quot;seriously inadequate,&quot; according to the report, co-authored by Demetrios G. Papademetriou, a population researcher. As a result, too many illegal immigrants have failed to get the message that the government is inviting them to legalize.    Although the INS is satisfied with the progress of the program, a debate looms in Congress over whether to extend the May 4 application deadline. The agency asserts that extensions would be costly, and claims &quot;there is no basis for arguments that there will be a significant shortfall of eligible applicants.&quot; The Carnegie report also opposes an extension, saying it would dilute the &quot;frenzy&quot; of last-minute applications other nations have experienced in similar programs.    Thus, the authors recommend a big, final-quarter dose of marketing to draw more applications, particularly from Asian and European immigrants, which the report says have been &quot;surprisingly underrepresented&quot; in the applicant pool.    In addition, the confidentiality provisions of the new law should be heavily promoted to employers, who have been &quot;extremely reluctant&quot; to provide workers with the documentation necessary to help them prove they fulfill the law's requirement of nearly continuous residency since Jan. 1, 1982. A few employers, such as Levi Strauss andamp; Co. and a number of California growers, organized programs to help employees apply. But far too many employers, often on the advice of attorneys, have resisted assisting immigrants in fear of exposing their businesses to tax and other employment-related liabilities, the authors note.    At the local level, at least, INS officials have been gearing up for a last-minute publicity blitz. In San Antonio, Texas, Efren Herrera, a former illegal who became place-kicker for the Dallas Cowboys, has appeared in radio and television spots exhorting illegals to apply. In Los Angeles and Hawaii, plans are under way to enlarge Lincoln's birthday into a &quot;Legalization Day.&quot;    But applicants' stories bear out the report's findings that the amnesty process has hurdles. Israel Opico, who has buffed the chrome doors of Houston's Texas Commerce Tower for the minimum wage for six years, delayed applying until recently because he mistrusted la migra. &quot;I thought they would send me back to El Salvador,&quot; he explains.    Stringent documentation rules have been another widespread problem. Twenty-eight-year-old Herman Martinez of South Florida, the father of three U.S.-born children, was disqualifed from the general legalization program because his eight years in the U.S. were interrupted by a stay of several months in Mexico. He had, however, harvested okra and oranges in the U.S., qualifying him under the more liberal farm worker program. Still, his paper work has been delayed by his boss's traveling.    The report includes a close examination of the performance of immigrant-assistance groups, many of which have been caustic adversaries of the INS. Certain immigrant advocates &quot;failed at times to draw and honor the necessary demarcation line between advocacy and service,&quot; the report asserts. </TEXT></DOC>
