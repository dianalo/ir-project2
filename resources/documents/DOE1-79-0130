In orderto step across the 80% efficiency threshold, a new approach was neededwhich would utilize the latent heat of condensation. The problems ofcorrosion, condensate disposal, and the need to provide mechanical ventilationneeded to be solved. A research and development program was undertakento develop a high-efficiency condensing boiler to meet the very specialneeds of the United Kingdom. The program of work was aimed at achievinga dimensionally compact design since, unlike heating systems in bothmainland Europe and in the USA, the central heating boiler is installedin the kitchen in the vast majority of cases. For the same reason, alow noise level was required if consumer complaints were to be negligible.It was important to assess whether high-efficiency condensing boilerscould be used in the boiler replacement market without the need to increaseradiator surface area. Other topics covered are the effects of laboratoryair conditions on measured efficiency and the effect this has on standards,and the advantages of drawing combustion air from outside the building.The results of laboratory and field testing are discussed, showing thathigh-efficiency condensing boilers can give bench efficiencies in excessof 90% (higher heating value) and year-round efficiencies of approximately85% in normal sized systems.</TEXT></DOC>
