BussStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GM GMEAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> MADISON, Wis.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp.'s $700 million buyout of H. Ross Perot served &quot;a fundamental business purpose&quot; because the auto maker's crucial relationship with Mr. Perot had broken down irreparably, said Roger B. Smith, chairman.    Mr. Smith also said he believes shareholder concern over the buyout of Mr. Perot has begun subsiding. &quot;Judging from my mail, it has peaked, and we're going to go on to other issues,&quot; he said. But Mr. Smith added that GM intends to confront any shareholder unease over the transaction &quot;until there is not one single question left.&quot;    Mr. Smith presented his first public defense of the Dec. 1 buyout of the billionaire Texan here yesterday before the Wisconsin Investment Board, holder of about 2% of GM's Class E stock. The board previously had condemned the buyout of Mr. Perot, founder of GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, as &quot;discriminatory&quot; against other shareholders.    But judging by the comments of investment-board members during and after the proceedings, Mr. Smith's personal appearance here apparently eased significantly their initial outrage over GM's purchase of Mr. Perot's Class E stock and contingent notes.    &quot;The explanation really helped to clarify what went on in the Perot affair,&quot; said Edward Hales, chairman of the Wisconsin board, at a news conference after the panel's two-hour public session with Mr. Smith and four other top GM executives. He added that it &quot;was difficult to say&quot; whether the board, which manages government workers' pension funds, had &quot;acted too hastily&quot; in filing with GM last month a shareholder resolution, to be considered at the company's annual meeting in the spring, that would ban similar buyouts of certain groups of holders.    Among shareholders still critical of GM's buyout of Mr. Perot are some members of the National Council of Institutional Investors, whose members are large institutional holders. Mr. Smith has agreed to meet with the group after having bowed out of a scheduled personal session with them last month.    Members of the Wisconsin board raised several concerns with Mr. Smith. Those issues included whether GM may have erred in stifling such a strong independent voice on GM's board, whether GM had paid Mr. Perot too high a premium for his 11.4 million Class E shares and contingent notes and whether GM could regain its former high standing with investors.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the Class E stock, which is tied directly to the financial performance of EDS, closed at $24.125 a share, down 62.5 cents. That compared with a closing price of $31.375 Nov. 28, the Friday before the Dec. 1 buyout.    Also in Big Board trading yesterday, GM closed at $69.125 a share, up 37.5 cents.    Mr. Smith and the other executives basically reiterated previous statements by GM officials about their rationale, with some embellishments. Mr. Smith insisted that it wasn't Mr. Perot's increasing public criticism of GM management that caused the company to buy him out, but rather the fact that Mr. Perot had &quot;flouted&quot; GM's rules of &quot;corporate governance&quot; by refusing to allow GM's auditors free access to EDS's books and by battling GM's right to determine the compensation of EDS executives.    &quot;Ross Perot couldn't accept the fact that he had sold EDS to GM and it was his corporate parent,&quot; Mr. Smith said. &quot;The actions that Ross took couldn't be tolerated.&quot;    Leon J. Krain, GM's treasurer, conceded that GM's price to Mr. Perot of $61.90 a unit -- which consisted of $33 for each Class E share, $23.50 for the contingent notes that accompanied each share and $5.40 for &quot;special interest&quot; to offset negative tax effects -- included a &quot;modest premium.&quot; But he insisted that there was a solid business reason to pay the premium: to rid GM of Mr. Perot.    Added Elmer W. Johnson, GM's group vice president and its chief counsel: &quot;The business purpose was to remove a serious obstacle to the smooth functioning of the auto maker's management.&quot;    Mr. Smith said that &quot;delivering high quality products&quot; eventually would prove to Wall Street and the public that &quot;what we did was right.&quot;    At his news conference, Mr. Smith also was peppered with questions from local reporters about whether the Wisconsin Investment Board's stance regarding the Perot affair would affect whether GM commits to producing a new line of pickup trucks at the company's Janesville, Wis., facility. Mr. Smith said repeatedly that there would be &quot;no connection.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
