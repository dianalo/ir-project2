The raid on the freighter left one crewman dead and two injured.   The British-flagged tanker, the 258,979-ton Esso Demetia, wasset ablaze at 6:05 p.m. southeast of the Saudi oil port of RasTanura, according to gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   It was not known if the attack by two Iranian gunboats or theresulting fire caused casualties aboard the Esso Demetia.   Four hours earlier, two Iranian gunboats attacked the 11,744-tonWest German vessel Dhaulagiri 300 miles to the south as it sailedinto Hormuz, the waterway connecting the Persian Gulf and the Gulfof Oman.   The freighter was manned by a crew of five Germans and 14Filipinos, the sources said. The seaman who was killed took adirect hit, but it was not known whether it was from a grenade ormachine-gun fire, they said. Two crewmen were injured by shrapnelfrom the rocket-propelled grenades, the executives said.   A man with a Filipino accent was heard radioing from thefreighter for assistance. ``He was begging, almost crying forhelicopter assistance to remove the wounded,'' said one executivewho monitored the radio call.   An Omani patrol boat later carried the injured to a hospital,they said.   The executives said the freighter was punctured with holes, butno fire broke out. It was heading for the Saudi Arabian port ofDammam, they said. The vessel was chartered by the AmericanPresident Lines Ltd. of San Francisco, to carry containers of cargoto Arab ports in the gulf.   The freighter's engine was not damaged, and it was expected togo to the southern gulf port of Dubai for repairs, the sources said.   The Iranian attacks were their first in two weeks and the fifthand sixth since May 3, when the U.S. Navy broadened its protectiverole to non-U.S. flagged vessels in the gulf.   On Thursday, Iraqi warplanes shattered a two-week lull in the``tanker war'' by attacking a salvage tugboat, the 742-tonSingapore-flag Salverve. The raid killed two seamen, shippingofficials reported.   On Friday, Baghdad Radio reported another Iraqi air raid hit a``large maritime target'' off the Iranian coast. But there has beenno independent confirmation of that raid.   Iran and Iraq, at war since 1980, have attacked more than 500merchant ships in the gulf since early 1984. More than 300 seamenhave been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
