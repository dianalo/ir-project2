<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-1006 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some basic mathematical features of covariance matrices are reviewed,particularly as they relate to the property of positive difiniteness.Physical implications of positive definiteness are also discussed. Considerationis given to an examination of the origins of non-positive definite matrices,to procedures which encourage the generation of positive definite matricesand to the testing of covariance matrices for positive definiteness.Attention is also given to certain problems associated with the constructionof covariance matrices using information which is obtained from evaluateddata files recorded in the ENDF format. Examples are provided to illustratekey points pertaining to each of the topic areas covered.</TEXT></DOC>
