(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A drifter accused of killing two people ona municipal bus in Florida had a concealed-weapon permit from thatstate, a newspaper reported.   Joseph Besaraba, who was arrested in Nebraska and is fightingextradition to Florida, obtained a Florida concealed-weapon permitin September 1988, listing a church's soup kitchen as his mailingaddress, the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported today.   Besaraba was accused of boarding a municipal bus in HollywoodSunday and fatally shooting driver Sydney Granger and passengerWesley B. Anderson with a 9mm semiautomatic pistol.   Besaraba then allegedly commandeered a getaway car, criticallywounding driver Scott Yaguda, 31, a bakery manager from Alexandria,Va., with gunshots to his back and legs. Yaguda was in stablecondition today at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, said spokeswomanCynthia Wine.   Since 1987, when the Florida Legislature made sweeping changesin the state's gun laws, concealed weapons permits have been issuedby the state instead of counties, and background checks done by theFlorida Department of Law Enforcement usually involve only acomputer check for felony convictions.   Since the relaxed requirements of the state law took effect,thousands of concealed-weapon permits have been issued in SouthFlorida, where only a few hundred had been issued before.   The 1987 law pre-empted tough local standards, said state Sen.Howard Forman.   ``In Broward County, for example, you had to not only have a joband an address but your occupation had to be one in which your lifewas in danger on a regular basis,'' said Forman, a former BrowardCounty commissioner. Hollywood is in Broward County.   Besaraba, 44, is being held in lieu of $1 million bail after hisdecision on Thursday to fight extradition to Florida. He wasarrested Wednesday as he lunged for the suspected murder weapon ina car stolen from the shooting scene, police said.   Florida has issued an arrest warrant on two counts offirst-degree murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder.He could face the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder.   He is facing Nebraska felony charges of attempted assault on apolice officer and possession of stolen property.   Keith County Attorney Deborah Gilg offered to drop the chargesif Besaraba would accept extradition to Florida. If convicted ofthe Nebraska charges, he faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a$25,000 fine, said Judge C.G. Wallace of Kimball County, whopresided over the Keith County Court hearing.   Wallace scheduled an Aug. 22 preliminary hearing.   Besaraba has long been a gun fancier, said his father, JosephAlexander Besaraba Sr., 69, of New York City.   The elder Besaraba said his son had been arrested several timesand had been convicted of a crime in Boston several years ago, buthe was uncertain of details. Police said a national crime computersystem showed that Besaraba had no criminal record.</TEXT></DOC>
