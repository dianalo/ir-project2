White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><DATELINE> CLARKSBURG, W.Va.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Good jobs have been disappearing from this hard-scrabble river town for years. Coal mines closing. Factories dying. Nobody liked it, but everyone accepted it.    Then Newell Co. executives blew in from their Midwest base last summer to announce they were shutting the city's last big glass plant, eliminating 942 more jobs. Suddenly all the old chin-up stoicism ended. Clarksburg got mad as hell.    &quot;Carpetbaggers,&quot; snorted Vice Mayor Robert T. &quot;Tom&quot; Flynn. &quot;We need to get angry. We need to go after these people.&quot; About 200 workers and business leaders rallied with him at the county courthouse. A state legislator was ready to blockade the factory doors with a bulldozer, if need be, to keep Newell from ripping out its glassmaking machinery. Finally, politically nimble Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. smacked Newell with a $614.6 million breach-of-contract lawsuit.    The Battle of Clarksburg reflects an emerging militancy in industrial America. From Kenosha, Wis., to Freehold, N.J., factory towns losing major plants are fighting back. After throwing money and favors at companies to win or preserve jobs, these communities now want their due. Maybe they can't force open bolted plant doors, but they are using public outrage, political pressure and legal leverage to extract compensation well above what union contracts and employee picket lines have yielded before.    Here, the public tantrum had an impact. Newell eventually closed the 87-year-old hillside factory west of town in November, but not on its own terms. It has had to pony up $1 million to aid workers and is discussing other reparations with the state, including possibilities for reopening the plant. Meantime, much of its equipment remains locked inside.    &quot;There is an important and very innovative principle here,&quot; says Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at San Diego. &quot;Companies used to seek incentives to move into an area. Now, they're paying incentives to move out.&quot;    This is the grubby side of the restructuring of corporate America. It is a backlash to the deluge of factory shutdowns and heavy layoffs flowing from the feverish takeovers, near-takeovers, mergers, buy-outs and spinoffs of recent years. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 2.8 million experienced workers lost jobs between 1981 and 1985 because their factories were closed. By January 1986, almost a third either were still searching for work or had given up or retired.    As such closings continue, the backlash grows. It's the stuff of Jesse Jackson's campaign tirades against corporate &quot;merging and purging.&quot; And it's behind language in the current Senate trade bill that would require a 60-day warning before a plant with 100 or more workers could be closed. Business has beaten back such measures before, but each time the idea reappears. Plant closings are &quot;perceived as much more of a national issue&quot; than before, says a Senate staffer.    Leaving town after partaking of public largess is becoming more than just rude. It may be actionable. Outfits that accept loans or other incentives and don't stick around are increasingly being sued for breach of contract. Companies &quot;have the freedom to come and go,&quot; concedes Dan Boroff, the city manager of Clarksburg. But he warns, &quot;Don't accept taxpayer dollars to subsidize these moves.&quot;    That's what galls people here, and it is behind the state's huge suit against Newell. Anchor Hocking Corp. originally owned the glass plant and happily scooped up $3.5 million in state loans at interest rates of 4% or less over the past decade. Then last July, Newell, of Freeport, Ill., acquired Anchor Hocking in a hostile takeover and later revealed its closing plan.    &quot;These conglomerates,&quot; says Mr. Flynn, the vice mayor. &quot;You don't know who they are.&quot;    Even outfits known to everyone in town can't take the money and run anymore. Norwood, Ohio, sued General Motors Corp. for $318.3 million last summer alleging breach of contract after GM said its 64-year-old car-assembly plant there was doomed.    Norwood is smarting from just spending $750,000 and sacrificing several streets for a railroad underpass to the plant, helping GM buy land to expand, &quot;and in general doing anything General Motors requested.&quot; It figures to lose $15.7 million in taxes by 1991 and has already fired policemen and firemen, raised water rates, and slashed other services.    GM says it tries to help communities in which it closes plants, and notes that Norwood workers will get more than $100 million in severance benefits. But since the flap began, GM has gotten more helpful. It has hired a developer to come up with a plan to make use of the site, and has also declared it won't seek a lower tax assessment on its now-idle plant. What it says it can't do is reopen.    Not that the new activism always works. Employees at a Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. recording-tape plant in Freehold, N.J., got native son Bruce Springsteen and other recording artists, many of them users of 3M tape, to publicly condemn a planned closing there. &quot;The Boss&quot; raised $5,000 for the cause in a local benefit and kicked in $20,000 of his own. But eight months later, 3M closed the plant right on cue. (Mr. Springsteen has since helped finance Hometowns Against Shutdowns, which consults with workers fighting shutdowns elsewhere.)    But protesters at Chrysler Corp. recently hit the jackpot. Plans to close most of an aging auto plant in Kenosha and lay off 5,500 people kicked up so much dust that a few weeks ago Chrysler tried to buy a little peace with a multimillion-dollar employee aid fund. And last week it gave up on selling its 20-factory Acustar parts-making subsidiary because of pressure from the United Auto Workers. Among the union's big fears was that a new owner would order wholesale shutdowns.    One big reason Chrysler is so vulnerable is none other than Lee A. Iacocca, America's straight-talking man of the people. To him, personal credibility is everything -- it once saved his company. It still sells his cars.    When Chrysler acquired American Motors Corp. last year, Wisconsin gave it pollution waivers worth $10 million. In exchange, the state felt it got a promise of three to five more years for the Kenosha complex.    Thus, when the word came, angry workers strutted sweatshirts depicting Mr. Iacocca with a Pinocchio nose. Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson started talking lawsuit -- an idea he got from West Virginia's Gov. Moore. Worse, in Kenosha people stopped buying Chryslers. &quot;We're right in the eye of the hurricane,&quot; says Ronald Palmen, a dealer whose January business plunged 60%. For a while a state senator tried to scuttle a $3.8 million state order for 393 new Chryslers.    &quot;Blame us for being dumb managers, but don't call me a liar,&quot; sputtered Mr. Iacocca as he announced he would surrender all profits earned from Wisconsin this year -- possibly $20 million -- to a housing and education fund for the idled workers. Mending fences with Rep. Les Aspin, Kenosha's congressman and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Iacocca next hinted that Chrysler might move some defense-contract work into Kenosha.    On Acustar, activists landed a rare preemptive blow. Closings, they figured, always follow sales. So forget about selling, they told Chrysler. Otherwise, workers will find ruses for striking local plants. Participation in joint programs with management will end. There will be a sales boycott -- pickets at the showrooms.    As always, victory has a price. Chrysler is keeping the subsidiary but will itself sell or close four plants employing 2,000 workers over the next 18 months. Still, the UAW is happy. At least one Chrysler insider, surprised by the recent outbreak of accommodation, is unhappy: &quot;This is Munich, peace in our time.&quot;    The Clarksburg glass-factory fracas shows just how unhappy people can get. At the time of Newell's takeover, spirits were high. Employment was up 80% from 1986, and glassware decorated with the cartoon cat Garfield was being pumped out to McDonald's restaurants.    &quot;When we heard the people from Newell were coming down, we thought, Good! They're taking an interest,&quot; says Robert Trent, a former personnel manager. Instead, Newell envoys curtly told the plant manager and union leaders the plant would close in 12 weeks. &quot;The meeting lasted 15 minutes,&quot; says union official Roger McIntyre.    One white-collar worker claims he became &quot;physically sick.&quot; Mr. Trent compares the company's severance offers to a slap in the face. Plant worker John Alexander says he got $1,100 for his 37 years. Townfolk got angry. &quot;It's the little guy who gets stepped on,&quot; says Mike Dyer, a local insurance agent.    Newell's chief executive officer, Daniel C. Ferguson, was, in turn, stunned by the backlash. &quot;We weren't prepared for it,&quot; he admits. &quot;We didn't anticipate the reaction we got.&quot; It seemed clear to him that closing down here and moving equipment elsewhere would greatly enchance the newly acquired unit's efficiency.    Meetings between Mr. Ferguson and a committee of Clarksburg leaders fighting the closing got testy. Workers watched the plant to make sure the company didn't remove equipment. &quot;We had the whole county police force alerted one night&quot; because it was thought Newell was trying to remove something, says John Jorgensen, union council president.    Later on, state lawyers won a federal-court injunction preventing Newell from transferring equipment to its other plants. Newell counterattacked. It had the case moved to state court and during a two-hour gap between federal and state injunctions hustled a $500,000 transformer out the door.    Newell countersued Gov. Moore personally for $30 million, charging he was disrupting the company's business &quot;through an intentional campaign of misinformation and distortion.&quot;    The two sides even engaged in a comic financial tiff. Newell sent the state checks for exactly $2,448,400.66 to discharge its loan obligations. The state cashed the checks before Gov. Moore could stop it. So he ordered the money sent back.    Newell and Gov. Moore are negotiating and may yet settle their differences. The company mostly disliked &quot;being hauled into court,&quot; Mr. Ferguson says. He calls the community &quot;great&quot; and the people &quot;super.&quot;    Meantime, closing the plant is costing Newell dearly. City officials think that Newell may owe as much as $250,000 in back wages under terms of an old federal grant to Anchor Hocking. A group of 59 white-collar workers is challenging the severance package. And, with the plant's machinery impounded, Newell hasn't been able to expand its glassmaking capacity elsewhere as planned to meet orders.    &quot;We've suffered quite a few millions in damages,&quot; says Mr. Ferguson. &quot;We ran out of a lot of stuff in January.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
