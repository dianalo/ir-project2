 Proponents such as the lobbyingorganization Computer Systems Policy Project (formed by IBM, HP,DEC and eight other firms) encourage the federal government tohelp them stop Japan's perceived dominance of high-technologymarkets.andP;  One argument is that a stronger electronics industrywould contribute to the reduction of the US trade deficit and thebudget deficit.andP;  Skeptics wonder about the implementation of apolicy similar to the US-Japan semiconductor agreement, whichharmed the US semiconductor industry instead of helping it and hadnegative ramifications for the computer industry as a whole.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Electronic IndustryInternational TradeGovernment RegulationForeign CompetitionTrade DeficitComputer Systems Policy Project.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Recommended Trade Policy Would Turn the TablesandM;Industry spokesmen, economists and some elected officials in theadministration and in Congress have urged the adoption of an &quot;industrialpolicy&quot; to remedy the perceived ills afflicting the electronics setor of oureconomy.andM;Its advocates claim that such a policy would recuce significantly the hugeU.S.andP;  trade imbalance, a major cause of our intractable budget deficit.andO;Rebalancing, if not restoring, the United States' hegemony in criticalhigh-tech product design and manufacture by aggressively establishing anindustrial policy is the only way to forestall the threat from the Pacificrim, it is argued.andM;Japanese ModelandM;The recommended policy's features would resemble those that Japan has pursuedso successfully for decades.andP;  Key aspects of the policy would target sectorsof the high-tech industry for special government assistance in the form ofsubsidies, antitrust exemption or import restrictins on competing products.andM;The opponents of an industrial policy contend that any such policy wouldrequire ineffective and heavy-handed bureaucrats at agencies such as theTreasury and Commerce departments, the Office of the U.S.andP;  TradeRepresentative and the Council of Economic Advisors to agree on who should bethe winners and the losers.andM;There seems to be a stand-off within government circles on what, if anything,to do, while the Japanese threaten to take over significant portions of thehigh-tech market, particularly dynamic memory chips, laser printers andsupercomputers.andM;The damaging fallout from the ill-conceived 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductoragreement, which mercifully expires next year, has seriously undermined thecase for such a policy.andP;  That pact was formed by our government underpressure from the beleaguered U.S.andP;  semiconductor companies and was virtuallyforced upon the Japanese.andM;The agreement did little to give the U.S.andP;  companies meaningful access to theJapanese market, nor did it restore truly competitive conditions here, whichwas its avowed purpose.andM;Controlling the SupplyandM;Instead, by virtue of their ability to control the supply of state-of-the-artchips, thanks to advanced design and production capabilities, the Japaneseraised prices and made more money than ever.andM;In the process, U.S.andP;  computer manufacturers were hurt.andP;  Their costsincreased, and in a period of slowing demand they could not pass theincreases along to their customers.andM;Like most U.S.andP;  government programs intended to help or guide businesses, thesemiconductor industry rescue initiative not only failed to achieve its goalsbut also left damage in its wake.andM;It seemed last year that the industrial policy debate might be taking a newturn when IBM Corp. spearheaded formation of the Computer Systems PolicyProject (CSPP).andP;  This organization with offices in Washington is a top-levellobbying group composed of 11 computer makers such as Digital EquipmentCorp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Unisys Corp.andM;Its mission is to persuade the government to adopt policies or maybe let IBMand its partners develop programs to blunt Japanese penetration of high-techmarkets here and in Eureope, while seeing to it that U.S.andP;  computer companieswill obtain more access to Japanese markets.andM;Among other measures, CSPP might agitate for minimum levels of Japanesepurchases of certain U.S.andP;  products such as supercomputers.andP;  It might seekselective antitrust exemptions, direct or indirect Randamp;D support, safeguardsfor intellectual property and imposition of targeted customs duties.andM;Is IBM stepping into the breach and providing the wherewithal to keepindustrial segments here and in Europe from being eaten alive by the Japanese-- and eventually the South Koreans?andM;IBM's True ColorsandM;IBM's real motives are not readily discernible.andP;  Such policy decisions aremade at the highest level of management, and few are made privy to thecompany's true intentions.andM;But I doubt that IBM in fact has made a conscious decision to take the leadin developing an industrial policy specifically for the computer industry.andM;To be sure, particularly in light of its own diminished prospects, it is inIBM's interest to seek removal or modifiation of roadblocks to its business.andO;And certainly the company does not want a repetition of the 1986 U.S.-Japansemiconductor agreement.andM;On the other hand, overt IBM lobbying for active restraints on Japanesehigh-tech-related business initiatives, even in concert with the otherleading computer firms via CSPP, strikes me as implausible.andM;Importantly, IBM's wholly owned, fast-growing Japanese subsidiary with annualrevenues exceeding $5 billion is a valuable asset.andM;It is important that IBM management would risk this crown jewel by allowingIBM to be identified with the recommendation for an anti-Japanese industrialpolicy.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
