West Jr. Now, Tesoro's fate may depend on his performance as a courtroom witness.    After years of having his $1.5 billion-a-year oil company attacked for alleged corruption, Mr. West recently told his side of the story in two weeks of often-combative testimony in federal court here.    Plaintiffs, who are Tesoro shareholders, allege he and other executives bribed foreign officials, violated federal securities laws and engaged in racketeering to build and maintain control of the company. They also allege that Tesoro officials, as part of an effort to avoid criminal prosecution, concocted a &quot;sham&quot; restructuring plan to drive down the price of Tesoro shares in an abortive attempt to take the company private in 1982. They are asking the six jurors to award $900 million in damages -- four times the company's current net worth -- and remove Tesoro's directors.    Tesoro's attorneys, besides stressing that Tesoro was never charged with criminal wrongdoing despite a six-year-long grand jury investigation, have tried to make the plaintiffs out as the real malefactors in the case. They argue that the class-action suit was organized by speculators who tried to obtain inside information to make a killing in Tesoro stock -- and who are now trying to loot Tesoro's treasury.    But in denying the allegations of securities fraud and racketeering on which Tesoro is now standing trial, Mr. West contradicted other witnesses, documentary evidence and even his own testimony at least a dozen times.    A long list of other witnesses have also testified in the trial, now in its fourth month. But it is Mr. West upon whom the outcome probably depends most. Testimony concluded this week, and closing arguments are scheduled to begin Monday.    Whatever the verdict, the trial has forced Mr. West to explain in detail how he built an international oil company during the late 1960s and early 1970s using undocumented cash &quot;finders fees&quot; and numerous &quot;gratuities&quot; to gain valuable foreign oil concessions. Mr. West acknowledged involvement in &quot;embarrassing&quot; situations, such as ordering Tesoro's investment banker to hire a prostitute to entertain an official of Trinidad and Tobago.    But Mr. West defended Tesoro's foreign payments, saying that most were innocent &quot;good will&quot; payments that benefited -- not hurt -- shareholders. For example, he said he was awarded a medal by the Bolivian navy after Tesoro contributed $21,000 to help transport two U.S. surplus patrol boats to the South American nation. Tesoro needed such good will to secure foreign oil properties, Mr. West suggested, because in the U.S., &quot;We have never been a huge success in finding oil and gas.&quot;    Judge H.F. &quot;Hippo&quot; Garcia has repeatedly threatened both lead defense attorney Richard Miller, Texaco Inc.'s attorney in its $10 billion court defeat by Pennzoil Co., and plaintiff's attorney Paul Rosen with fines and jail terms for their frequent clashes. Many occurred with Mr. West on the stand, where plaintiffs accused him of changing his story to fit his defense.    For example, Mr. Miller depicted Mr. West as a workaday oilman with a net worth of barely $1 million -- with most of that in Tesoro stock. On cross-examination, Mr. West, whose cash salary is $525,000 a year, was forced to read private 1986 banking records -- obtained days before -- listing his net worth at $7.7 million.    Mr. West acknowledged enmeshing himself in &quot;embarrassing&quot; situations during the early 1970s, before investigations into foreign payments by U.S. companies began. In other instances, however, he maintained he was careful not to ask too many questions.    In one case, Mr. West portrayed himself as a victim of circumstances. James Morgan, a weapons inventor who helped Tesoro arrange lucrative Bolivian oil-drilling rights, had told a grand jury that Mr. West gave him a briefcase stuffed with a $200,000 bribe for a Bolivian oil official. Mr. West contended the money was purely a finders fee, and that he never asked why Mr. Morgan wanted the money in cash.    Mr. West admitted that he, Mr. Morgan and the cash wound up in the same Los Angeles home with the Bolivian. But he said he never saw the briefcase containing Mr. Morgan's &quot;finders fee&quot; handed over to the Bolivian. Mr. West said he left the meeting quickly because he was uncomfortable.    While the foreign payments occurred during the early 1970s, the plaintiffs allege they weighed heavily in Tesoro's decisions for years afterwards because the company was under repeated investigations until 1984. Mr. Rosen, the shareholders' attorney, claims Tesoro fended off a takeover offer from Diamond Shamrock Corp. in 1980 because Mr. West and other board members were afraid they would lose corporate perks and the company's backing for their criminal defense.    Mr. West and other directors claim that Tesoro never got a firm offer from Diamond Shamrock. But Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, a former Tesoro director who left the board after tangling with Mr. West, testified that he was told Diamond Shamrock offered a premium price of $35 a share at a time when Tesoro stock was selling below $22 a share. Diamond Shamrock officials haven't been called as witnesses to confirm or deny the bid.    At the time, Mr. West told the jury, he was trying to protect shareholders, not his own salary. But the plaintiffs' lawyers produced a confidential memo written to the head of Tesoro's compensation committee in which Mr. West requested a so-called golden parachute worth nearly $1.8 million and expressed his concern that the benefits package &quot;was now questionable or in jeopardy&quot; because of the hostile bid.    After Diamond Shamrock dropped its bid, Tesoro's stock price sank $10 into the low $20's, and the company's problems with dissident shareholders increased. &quot;We got a lot of unhappy arbitragers and speculators who got caught at $30 a share, and we got a lot of H-E-L-L out of that,&quot; Mr. West testified.    Pressured by the criticism, Mr. West began working with investment bankers in 1981 to study a plan to spin off part of Tesoro's assets and to take the rest private through a leveraged buyout. Mr. West said he was trying to improve values for shareholders, but a lawyer hired by a committee of outside directors wrote in a memo that Mr. West believed the continuing grand jury inquiry &quot;could be handled more effectively by a low-profile, private company.&quot;    The restructuring never came off. Several Tesoro directors testified the plan was killed by slumping energy prices and skittish investors. But the plaintiffs contend that the leveraged buyout died because outside directors insisted that it would require detailed disclosures about the grand jury's investigation -- disclosures Mr. West was unwilling to make.    But when the buyout plans fizzled, Mr. West still wanted to take Tesoro private, plaintiffs argue. In notes taken by Tesoro advisers at the time, Mr. West was still stating that his &quot;principal goal in life&quot; was to take Tesoro private. And he said on cross-examination that Tesoro's investment banker still &quot;hoped at some future date it might be revived.&quot;    At that point, while the public anticipated a going-private plan, Tesoro instead announced a watered-down restructuring plan that disappointed investors, driving down the price of Tesoro stock by $5 a share. Weeks later, Tesoro abandoned the restructuring plan altogether and announced a share buyback.    The plaintiffs argue that Tesoro never intended to carry out the restructuring, and that Tesoro had developed the &quot;sham&quot; plan only to cut Tesoro's stock price. The drop in the stock price made the share buyback cheaper -- and, plaintiffs contend, made any future going-private plan more affordable. </TEXT></DOC>
