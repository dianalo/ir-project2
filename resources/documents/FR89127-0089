Corporation also provides post-issuance creditmonitoring for obligations covered by financial guaranty contracts writtenby Capital Guaranty Insurance Company, as well as contracts written byunaffiliated third parties, through Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary,Capital Guaranty Service Corporation.Financial guaranty insurance is designed to enhance the marketability ofcertain debt obligations by reducing the risk of loss to the holders ofthe obligations through guaranteed payment of the obligation in the eventa demand for payment is made under the financial guaranty contract. TheBoard has not previously approved the activity of financial guaranty insuranceunder section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may,with Board approval, engage in any activity ``which the Board after duenotice and opportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation)to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks asto be a proper incident thereto.'' A particular activity may be found tomeet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated thatbanks have generally provided the proposed activity; that banks generallyprovide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to theproposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide theproposed activity; or that banks generally provide services that are sointegrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provisionin a specialized form. <T3>National Courier Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition,the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activityhas a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controllingbanks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 <T3>Federal Register </T3>806 (1984).Applicant states that financial guaranty insurance activities are closelyrelated to banking and are a proper incident thereto because (1) the proposedactivities constitute an extension of credit, which is a classic bankingfunction, and (2) banks in fact conduct the proposed activities in otherforms and provide services that are operationally or functionally similarto the proposed activities so as to equip Applicant with the skills neededto provide the proposed activities through Corporation. Applicant contendsthat financial guaranty insurance contracts are the functional equivalentof letters of credit, citing <T3>American Insurance Association </T3>v. <T3>Clarke, </T3>656 F. Supp. 404 (D.D.C. 1987), 854 F.2d 1405 (D.C. Cir.1988), affirmed in part, vacated in part, No. 87-5128 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 6,1989) (per curiam), in support of its contention. In addition, Applicantargues that Congress did not intend by Title VI of the Garn-St GermainAct (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) to restrict the Board's discretion to approvethis type of activity because Congress did not treat other functionallyequivalent forms of credit enhancement as restricted ``insurance.'' InApplicant's view, the characterization of financial guaranty contractsas ``insurance'' under the laws of certain states is irrelevant to whetherthe Board retains discretion to approve this activity.Applicant also contends that credit monitoring is closely related to bankingbecause banks and other commercial lenders monitor a borrower's creditand financial condition throughout the life of the borrowing in order toreduce the lender's exposure. According to Applicant, credit-monitoringactivities are permissible under a bank holding company's express authorityto make, acquire or service loans or other extensions of credit for itsown account or for the account of others, as well as Board precedent permittingbank holding companies to arrange, and to give advice with respect to,extensions of credit. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 225.25(b)(1). Applicant also analogizes credit monitoringto the permissible activities of operating a credit bureau, assisting inloan collections and providing information to third parties for a fee.<T3>See </T3>12 CFR 225.25(b) (23) and (24); <T3>Mellon Bank Corporation, </T3>74 Federal Reserve Bulletin 773 (1988);and <T3>Reagan Bancshares, Inc., </T3>72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 669 (1986).In determining whether a particular activity is a proper incident to banking,the Board considers whether the performance of the activity by an affiliateof a holding company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits tothe public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gainsin efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentrationof resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, orunsound banking practices.Applicant maintains that its proposal would be pro-competitive and wouldenable it to provide greater convenience and increased services to customers.In addition to expanding the role of Applicant in an existing, though relativelysmall, market participant, Applicant will be able to broaden the base ofexperience for Corporation's targeted market of smaller regional issuersthat are predominately located in the Western United States. Applicantalso argues that the proposal would not result in adverse effects becauseabusive practices such as ``tying'' or conflict of interests are very remotepossibilities under the proposed activities.In publishing this proposal for comment, the Board does not take any positionon issues raised by the proposal under the BHC Act. Notice of the proposalis published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons onthe issues presented by the application and does not represent a determinationby the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standardsof the BHC Act.Any request for a hearing on these questions must, as required by andSection;262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompaniedby a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not sufficein lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact thatare in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing,and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approvalof the proposal.The application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governorsor the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing andreceived by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than February 27, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jennifer J.
