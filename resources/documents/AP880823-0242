Birmingham Steel, based in Birmingham, Ala., and anotherunidentified group offered to buy the plant for $115 million in adeal for the building, property and equipment.   Company officials said Iraq's offer of $100 million was forplant and equipment. The Iraqis are interested in dismantling theplant to be shipped home in pieces and reassembled.   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, is opposing the Iraq deal, saying thesale would reduce this country's steelmaking capabilities andincrease domestic steel prices.
