One single-processor machine, called the ETA-10 model P, would cost $995,000 for a system including disk drives and operating software. A second, slightly more powerful, model, the Q, is priced at $1.2 million. Both models are air-cooled and can run in an ordinary office, Minneapolis-based Control Data said.    While the introduction of the machines had been expected, their price tags were lower than most industry analysts had predicted, and they are half that of Cray's least-expensive model. Moreover, unlike the Cray models, Control Data's latest machines don't require special coolants to protect circuitry from high temperatures generated during computational runs.    Both of the Control Data machines are made by ETA Systems Inc., a unit formed four years ago after the company had relinquished its lead in supercomputers to Cray in the 1970s.    Such low-end machines are viewed as &quot;starter sets&quot; intended to woo users of smaller, slower computers into supercomputing, in which machines do massive computations at high speed. Earlier this year Cray, which dominates the high-end supercomputer market world-wide, introduced a machine costing $2.5 million.    Control Data said yesterday its &quot;starter set&quot; prices reflect the capabilities of its highly automated manufacturing plant in St. Paul, Minn., where the breadboard-sized central processors can be turned out in volume. Until now, most supercomputers have been custom-made, involving hundreds of hours of wiring by hand; indeed, Cray, which is also based in Minneapolis, is only now moving into automated manufacturing.    Performance tests on the ETA low-end model peg the P's top speed at 375 million instructions per second, or MIPS. The MIPS rate is several times faster than minisupercomputers, although much slower than full-sized multiprocessor supercomputers.    Analysts who viewed the ETA unveiling here said the stated performance was impressive, although some cautioned that, as with most computers, their utility would be determined largely by software applications. Supercomputers are designed to tackle certain types of problems that lend themselves to highly repetitive processing and, thus far, have been aimed primarily at the scientific and engineering markets.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Control Data shares closed at $35, up 25 cents, while Cray fell $1.50 to $90.75. </TEXT></DOC>
