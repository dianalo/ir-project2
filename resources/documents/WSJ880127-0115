Posner </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   Mark Kelman's &quot;A Guide to Critical Legal Studies&quot; (Harvard, 360 pages, $30) is a comprehensive and vigorously written survey and synthesis of Critical Legal Studies by a partisan of the movement who teaches at the Stanford Law School. Although I take umbrage at being falsely accused by the author of sins ranging from &quot;unconscionable red-baiting&quot; to &quot;the denial of contradiction in discourse, here through recourse to false vacuum boundaries,&quot; my overall impression is of a book of genuine scholarship, though one marred by stridency and turgidity, as well as by exaggeration and a patronizing tone. Despite serious flaws it is probably the best book to have emerged from the CLS movement, a movement that has a growing following in American law schools.    Mr. Kelman mounts an all-out attack on efforts both old and new to depict law as a reasonably objective, reasonably disinterested, reasonably nonpartisan, reasonably civilized method for resolving conflicts and securing liberty, efficiency and other widely shared values. All these efforts, he argues, have been wretched failures. To him, American law is a predominantly conservative ideology dedicated to shoring up the false dichotomies on which classical liberalism rests -- such dichotomies as public vs. private, voluntary vs. involuntary (or chosen vs. determined), self vs. other, rule vs. discretion, court vs. legislature, making policy vs. interpreting authoritative texts. By presenting these dichotomies as natural, law makes &quot;counterhegemonic thoughts . . . harder to think.&quot;    The charge has a kernel of truth. There is a fair amount of mystification in legal discourse, especially at the judicial and professorial levels. The pooh-bahs of the legal profession exaggerate the neutrality of legal doctrines and institutions; understate the law's political and contingent nature; inflate the competence and disinterest of judges, jurors, legislators and other legal actors; and make unfounded claims for the cogency of legal reasoning. Mr. Kelman's book is a massive antidote to inflated Bicentennial rhetoric about the rule of law, and that is all to the good.    But he goes way overboard. He is too quick to find contradiction, too dismissive of efforts to reconcile apparent conflicts, too contemptuous of practical reason. Although he considers mainstream legal thought little better than a snow job, his book invites characterization in similar terms (showing that people are most sensitive to their own faults found in other people). His method is to depict mainstream thinkers not as people with whom one might disagree but as people who cannot think -- who make arguments that are &quot;truly bizarre,&quot; &quot;ludicrously general,&quot; &quot;hopelessly confused,&quot; &quot;clearly sloppy and inapt,&quot; &quot;obviously naive,&quot; &quot;transparent failures.&quot;    When mainstream legal thinkers are not dumb, they are vicious: The framers of the Constitution are &quot;not an especially attractive group of people to use as models, but rather an overtly racist, slaveholding or slavery-tolerating group of privileged white males.&quot; Denunciation so scathing that it carries the reader along against his or her better judgment enables Mr. Kelman to shift inquiry almost imperceptibly from whether mainstream legal thought is really so incoherent as he thinks to how anyone could be fooled by such rubbish; the answer is ideology, from which he himself happily is free.    Mr. Kelman's determination to debunk every proposition associated with Western liberals (a group that extends all the way from &quot;anarchic libertarians&quot; on the right to &quot;New Deal apologists&quot; on the left) or with their paladins, the mainstream legal thinkers, leads him repeatedly to take extreme positions, as when he says with apparent seriousness, &quot;Rules are the opiate of the masses.&quot; (In remarks such as these one senses the unreconstructed 1960s radical -- the &quot;trasher&quot; who coexists uneasily with Mr. Kelman's alternative persona as sober scholar.) He thinks marital rape may well be a more serious crime than rape by a stranger; even that making rape a crime may have been a device for fooling women into thinking they have rights. He thinks the decision in Roe vs. Wade may have been intended to give men freer access to women by reducing the consequences of an accidental pregnancy. Common sense is not Mr. Kelman's strong suit.    Mr. Kelman scores many of his points simply by demanding of his opponents a degree of rigor that is unattainable when analyzing social phenomena, such as law; he plays to the hilt the mainstream lawyer's game of defeating an opponent by shifting the standard of proof. Mr. Kelman believes that if he can demolish (or as he likes to say, &quot;trash&quot;) the intellectual foundations of Western liberalism as they are revealed in the writings of mainstream jurists, something better will rise from the ashes, but he makes no effort to justify that faith, instead ending the book with this wistful sentence: &quot;The Critics try to retrace, hoping to see where we first got lost.&quot; He has, however, succeeded in establishing his credentials as a powerful critic of mainstream legal thinking, and that is a genuine achievement.    ---   Mr. Posner is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. </TEXT></DOC>
