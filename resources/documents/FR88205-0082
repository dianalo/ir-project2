The following summary also contains a list of submissions thatwere dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals</ITAG>Coalition for Safe Power, 12/11/87, KFA-0141The Coalition for Safe Power (Coalition) filed an Appeal from a denialof a Request for Information submitted by the Coalition under the Freedomof Information Act (FOIA). The Coalition had sought a copy of a reportfrom Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories regarding the feasibilityof converting a partially completed commercial nuclear reactor to a federallyowned reactor which would produce weapons grade nuclear material. The AssistantManager for Information of the Richland Operations Office withheld thereport in its entirety as a deliberative document under Exemption 5 ofthe FOIA. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that the report waspart of the deliberative process, even though it had been prepared by attorneysoutside the government. The DOE also found that sharing the document withCongressmen and state officials, or possible limited unauthorized disseminationdid not extinguish the privilege of withholding under Exemption 5. Finally,the DOE found that the report contained segregable factual material whichthe Assistant Manager had improperly failed to release. Accordingly, theAppeal was granted in part and remanded to the Assistant Manager to releaseany segregable factual material.Judith M. Gibbs, 12/8/87, KFA-0139Judith M. Gibbs filed an Appeal from a denial by the Assistant Managerfor Administration, Richland Operations Office (Authorizing Official) ofa Request for Information which she had submitted under the Freedom ofInformation Act (FOIA). Ms. Gibbs sought sections of a policy guide preparedby a DOE contractor (Battelle Memorial Institute) dealing with the terminationof employees. The DOE found that the Authorizing Official had properlydetermined that the materials sought were not ``agency records'' subjectto the FOIA and that Ms. Gibbs' Appeal accordingly should be denied. Importantissues considered in the Decision and Order were whether the Battelle MemorialInstitute is an ``agency'' for purposes of the FOIA and whether the requestedmaterials had been acquired by the DOE and thereby had become ``agencyrecords.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG>B.A. Mehmert, et al., 12/10/87, RF272-1031, et al.The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting refunds from crude oil overchargefunds to 47 applicants based on their respective purchases of refined petroleumproducts during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981.

Good Hope Refineries/Tenneco Oil Company, 12/7/87, RF189-10 The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from the Good HopeRefineries consent order fund to Tenneco Oil Company. The DOE stated thatsince Tenneco was a spot purchaser of Good Hope petroluem products, thefirm was required to overcome the presumption that it was not injured bythose Good Hope spot purchases. For a majority of its purchases, Tennecofailed to rebut that presumption. In fact, the DOE found that Tenneco soldat a profit a majority of the motor gasoline which it purchased from GoodHope. However, the DOE found that during two months of the consent orderperiod, Tenneco sold Good Hope motor gasoline at less than its purchaseprice. The DOE also found that during those same two months, Tenneco hadimposed allocation fractions of less than 100 percent. Based on those findings,the DOE concluded that Tenneco had overcome the spot purchaser presumptionfor its purchases of Good Hope motor gasoline during those two months.Accordingly, the firm was granted a refund of its full allocable shareof the Good Hope refund pool for those purchases.
