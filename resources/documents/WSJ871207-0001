The KIO, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, said Friday it owns 622.5 million BP shares, valued at #450 million ($811.8 million), and analysts said the agency might boost its stake further if the BP share price remains sluggish. Last month, the KIO unexpectedly emerged as the biggest investor in Britain's biggest company, by buying 600 million shares, or a 10.1% stake.    Heavy London trading in BP after the KIO announcement stirred speculation by analysts that the agency may have further increased its stake, and that other investors were buying BP shares on the strength of the KIO interest. Under British regulations, the KIO has several working days to disclose any additional stake.    The KIO usually keeps a low profile. Nothing on the outside of its headquarters building facing St. Paul's Cathedral indicates it is home for anything other than a tuxedo-rental shop. But the KIO's investment power commands considerable attention.    The agency and its parent, the Kuwait Investment Authority, manage an estimated $85 billion. This makes the Kuwaiti agency among the world's 10 biggest investors, on a par with such giants as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. Most of Kuwait's investing is in Europe, but it also has been a big player in U.S. equities, traders say.    &quot;The KIO goes where it likes,&quot; Mehdi Varzi, an oil analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson, says. &quot;And they can afford a long-term point of view.&quot;    With BP, the Kuwaitis apparently decided that the British government's sale of 2.19 billion shares of the oil giant presented a &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; opportunity to buy a major stake without boosting the stock price, says David Gray, oil analyst at London stockbrokers James Capel.    Kuwait established the KIO in London in the 1950s, with a mission to invest oil profits for the benefit of future generations when the oil runs out. The KIO won't disclose finances or grant interviews. But according to Kuwait's central bank, investment income now contributes more than oil to national revenue. Kuwait's current indicated annual oil revenue, based on the nation's production quota and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' benchmark price of $18 a barrel, is about $6.5 billion.    The KIO grew into a heavyweight in the 1970s, as then-booming oil prices poured billions into its coffers. Generally, the agency has focused on long-term investing, keeping its distance from companies in which it invests. It has held 14% of Daimler-Benz AG since the 1970s without trying to influence management, a spokesman for the West German car maker says.    But in recent years, the KIO has begun moving in and out of other stocks more quickly. It has often bought stakes in possible British takeover targets and subsequently announced those purchases, apparently hoping its presence might put the company into play.    Earlier this year, the KIO nettled the Bank of England by using an anonymous account there to accumulate quietly almost 5% of an English merchant bank. Such accounts, by custom, are provided as a service to royalty and sovereigns.    And in 1985, it bought nearly 8% of Hanson PLC from underwriters stuck with an undersubscribed share issue. Analysts estimate the KIO made at least a #20 million profit when it later sold the shares. Now, the KIO is moving boldly in Spain, acquiring stakes in industrial companies and banks viewed as takeover targets.    The KIO's strategy is to &quot;take quite sizable positions,&quot; says David Malcolm, deputy group general manager of Royal Insurance PLC, in which the KIO once held the biggest single stake. &quot;If they see a good profit, they get out.&quot;    Such maneuvering makes the KIO conspicuous, a state it is usually scrupulous to try to avoid. The office's general manager, Fouad Jaffar, has diplomatic status and supervises a staff of about 120 people. Trading is led by half a dozen British fund managers and several Kuwaiti staffers.    Mr. Jaffar declined to be interviewed. Earlier this year, a KIO executive explained that the Kuwaitis &quot;don't like to see stories about all this money floating around that could be used on hospitals back home.&quot; The agency also is conscious that every investment &quot;has a political aspect,&quot; says Michael Unsworth, an oil analyst at London stockbrokers Smith New Court. &quot;They are very careful not to make political waves.&quot;    Still, some investment ideas do go haywire. The KIO's U.K. fund managers were rebuked by their Kuwaiti bosses in 1985 when they bought shares in Scotch whisky maker Arthur Bell andamp; Sons PLC despite Moslem restrictions on alcohol.    Even a previous KIO maneuver in oil stocks shows the agency doesn't &quot;have a monopoly of wisdom,&quot; Kleinwort Grieveson's Mr. Varzi says. Last December, he recalls, the KIO sold a large load of BP shares prior to an OPEC meeting. &quot;They were worried that oil prices would fall,&quot; he says.    Instead, oil prices subsequently roseas did BP's share price. If the Kuwaitis had only held on to their BP, Mr. Varzi says, &quot;They would have had a windfall.&quot;    Tokyo shares closed slightly higher Saturday after closing down 205.41 points Friday, when investors reacted bearishly to the dollar's somewhat weak gyrations on the currency markets and a statement by Japan's finance minister, regarding prospects for another Japanese discount rate cut, saying he didn't see any need for a change in monetary policy now.    The 225-stock Nikkei average, which declined Friday in moderate profit taking, ended Saturday's light half-day trading session at 22673.41, up 70.66 points.    In early trading Monday in Tokyo, stock prices continued to rise. The Nikkei average was up 27.98 to 22701.39 at the end of the morning session.    Brokers said concerns over Wall Street's future direction and the yen-dollar rate put institutional investors on the sidelines. One major security-house analyst said the investors weren't likely to participate in the market with substantial volume &quot;until the announcement of the U.S. Trade balance&quot; on Thursday.    London stocks eased Friday but closed above the day's lows, as participants reacted to a steadier dollar and a recovery on Wall Street.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed off 0.9 point at 1262.7. Volume was 596.9 million shares, up from 494.4 million shares a day earlier.    Dealers said trading volumes remained thin, though above the low levels of recent weeks; analysts said U.K. institutions still are holding back from the market, to build cash reserves. The 100-share index was off 5.6 points at 1582.8 at the close, the day's best level.    The market remained in negative territory all day Friday, following Wall Street's 72.44-point plunge Thursday and decline on opening Friday, but London shares recovered toward the close, as Wall Street curbed some of its early losses. Sentiment also was helped by a rise in the dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in the currency markets.    Major issues were mixed at the close, with the majority of the 100-share index stocks showing losses.    Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed sharply lower, sparing no sector, in slack trading Friday. Brokers cited disappointment about the weak results of Thursday's concerted European rate cuts, the weakness of the dollar, and Thursday's drop on Wall Street.    Stocks closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong and Singapore, and were mixed to weaker in Manila. Prices fell across Europe, dropping in Paris, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.    % This                             Dec 3      Dec 2      Year    U.S. ................... 210.2      217.8     -  7.8    Britain ................ 474.1      475.2     -  4.7    Canada ................. 324.8      334.3     -  2.5    Japan ................. 1096.2     1103.5     + 16.0    France ................. 296.3      298.6     - 27.4    Germany ................ 160.0      160.4     - 38.4    Hong Kong ............. 1459.2     1488.7     - 18.0    Switzerland ............ 142.7      144.6     - 28.9    Australia .............. 246.1      251.5     -  6.8    World index ............ 385.3      392.3     +  8.0</TEXT></DOC>
