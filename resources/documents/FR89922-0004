Both the 72 COLREGS and the 1981 amendmentswere proclaimed by the President and were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (42 FR 17112, March 31, 1977, and 48 FR 28634,June 23, 1983). On November 19, 1987, the Assembly of the InternationalMaritime Organization (IMO) adopted additional amendments to the 72 COLREGSwhich will enter into force for the United States of America on November19, 1989.33 U.S.C. 1602 provides that amendments to the International Regulationsfor Preventing Collisions at Sea be proclaimed by the President and thatthe Proclamation with the annexed international regulations amendmentsbe published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This rule, therefore, publishes the President'sJune 29, 1989, Proclamation and the 1987 amendments to the 72 COLREGS.Appendix A to 33 CFR part 81 contains the text of the 72 COLREGS as amendedin 1981. This rule amends appendix A to include the amendments adoptedin 1987, which become effective on November 19, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Amendments/Changes</ITAG>There are nine amendments to the 72 COLREGS. Each of these amendments arediscussed below:Rule 1(e)_The amendment to Rule 1(e) for vessels of special constructiondeletes the phrase ``without interfering with the special function of thevessel.'' This amendment simplifies the government's determination thata vessel complies as closely as possible with the Rules.Rule 3(h)_The amendment to Rule 3(h) adds a new consideration, width ofnavigable water, when determining if a vessel is constrained by her draft.Rule 8_The amendment to Rule 8 adds a new paragraph (f) which defines theconduct required by the terminology ``not to impede'' in passing situations.Rule 10(a)_The amendment to Rule 10(a) adds the phrase ``and does not relieveany vessel of her obligation under any other rule.'' The amendment makesit clear that the 72 COLREGS apply in addition to the special rules forvessels in traffic separation schemes.Rule 10(c)_The amendment to Rule 10(c) adds the phrase ``on a heading.''The amendment clarifies the rule by inserting the words ``on a heading''which are implied in the present language of the rule.Annex 1, section 2(d)_The amendment applies the height requirement formasthead lights to the optional all-around light of Rule 23(c)(i).Annex 1, section 2(i)(ii)_The amendment substitutes the phrase ``abovethe gunwale'' for ``above the hull''. The amendment better defines thelocation from which the masthead light is measured when two or three lightsare carried in a vertical line on a vessel less than 20 meters in length.Annex 1, sections 10 (a) and (b)_The amendments add the word ``underway''after the words ``sailing vessels'' to clarify the applicability of theannex.Annex IV, section 1_A new paragraph (o) is added (Distress signals)_Theamendment adds ``approved signals transmitted by radiocommunication systems''to the list of approved distress signals. The new signals include the InternationalMaritime Satellite Corporation (INMARSAT) system and the Digital SelectiveCalling (DSC) system.Since this revision is concerned with a foreign affairs function of theUnited States, it is excepted from the rulemaking requirements under 5U.S.C. 553 and may be published without notice and opportunity for publiccomment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. PeterPalmer, Project Manager, Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services,and Christena Green, Office of Chief Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 81</ITAG>Navigation (water), Treaties.In consideration of the foregoing, the President's Proclamation of June29, 1989, and the 1987 Amendments to the 72 COLREGS are set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.W.
