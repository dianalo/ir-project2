Currently, this supply is measuredby the amount of remaining established reserves. If prices were to changedrastically, the amount of reserves which could actually be recoveredmay be substantially different. This study constructed a model to helpanalyze the effects of price changes on established reserves, and alsoreserves additions from both new discoveries and extensions of olderpools. The model employs the Saskatchewan government well data base andresearch on the royalty rates, taxes, and operation costs. The resultsshow that the short-run supply of crude oil, defined as supply withoutfurther exploration or development, does not change dramatically unlessprices fall well below $10/bbl. The model was run over a 19-year periodto obtain these results. If the base case were run for a longer period,the added production would approximate the added reserves estimate. However,if prices were to fall to the lower price forecast for an indefiniteperiod, up to 20 million cubic meters of established reserves could belost. The long-run analysis includes both current established reservesand those likely to be discovered in the future; an interesting resultof this section of the study is that most future reserves additions arelikely to come from extensions of already-discovered pools. 22 refs.,9 figs., 30 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
