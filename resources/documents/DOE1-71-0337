<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-0337 </DOCNO><TEXT>In March 1985 British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan signed the WesternAccord, an agreement concerning oil and gas pricing and taxation, withthe federal government. One of the almost immediate effects of the Accordwas the deregulation of oil pricing, but the agreement had import fornatural gas as well. Under the system of natural gas pricing and marketingin place prior to deregulation, natural gas was purchased by TransCanadaPipeLines from western producers and resold to distributors in centralCanada under long term contracts. Gas was priced in both transactionswith reference to an Alberta border price which was fixed through agreementbetween Alberta and the federal government. The October 1985 Agreementdid away with the Alberta border price, leaving gas prices to be negotiated,and provided that TCPL would no longer enjoy a monopoly in central Canadiangas markets. With the Agreement in place, it became possible for endusers to purchase gas directly from producers and use TCPL only for transportationservice. The NEB denied the Manitoba Oil and Gas Corporation's applicationfor an order compelling transportation of its direct purchases of gas.The Board's reasoning was: MOGC's proposal amounted to self-displacement;self-displacement was contrary to the intent of the Agreement and thereforenot in the public interest; the transportation order was denied. Subsequentto the NEB's decision the Manitoba gas utilities and Western Gas MarketingLtd. (the marketing branch of TCPL) entered into a one-year contractthat has Manitobans paying about $2.30/Mcf, down from about $3.00, butstill more than the price of gas in direct sales. Notwithstanding thistemporary compromise, the MOGC has applied to the Federal Court of Appealfor leave to appeal the Board's dismissal of its application. 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
