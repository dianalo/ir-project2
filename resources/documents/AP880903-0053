About 250 dirty and unshaven workers left the July Manifestocoal mine, where they had been holed up since Aug. 16. They carriedtheir belongings in plastic bags and sang the national anthem asthey walked through a heavy drizzle to a nearby church.   Solidarity activist Jan Litynski said the miners agreed to haltthe strike early today after a night of talks with Solidarityleader Lech Walesa.   The end came on the eighth anniversary of the end of anotherstrike by Jastrzebie coal miners during the upheaval that gave riseto Solidarity.   Earlier, more than 2,000 port and transit workers in Szczecinleft the work sites they had occupied since Aug. 17. Artur Balasz,a member of the strike committee there, said they ended the sit-indespite worker allegations that the government had backed down onpromises of job security for strikers.   The miners walked two miles to a Jastrzebie church, where apriest celebrated Mass for them, their families and supporters fromother mines. Other miners waiting at the church chanted, ``Thankyou, thank you!'' as the July Manifesto miners arrived.   A string of police vehicles pulled out of the city, road blockswere dismantled and no strike banners remained at the mine.   The nationwide strikes for legalization of Solidarity, higherpay and better working conditons began at July Manifesto.   At its peak, the unrest involved 20 enterprises employing100,000 workers, including the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk whereSolidarity was born and where Walesa works as an electrician.   On Wednesday, Walesa appealed for an end to the strikes so thatpromised talks with the government could begin on the strikers'demands. The July Manifesto workers demanded that Walesa explainhis appeal in person.   The opposition and authorities were preparing lists of proposedparticipants for the talks, said Roman Catholic mediator JacekAmbroziak in Warsaw.   Walesa, who rose before dawn Friday and drove seven hours fromhis Baltic coast home in Gdansk to the mine, pressed through theafternoon until early today with miners to end the strike.   A new round of negotiations with management was launched withWalesa's participation and lasted into early today, said officialsat the mine.   ``Everybody was very nervous throughout ... Walesa helped us outa lot. He helped map the way out of our situation,'' said GrzegorzSawski, a member of the strike committee.   The haggling concerned winning guarantees of job and personalsecurity for strikers, said a Polish journalist at the mine, whoasked not to be identified.   The 1,800 dock workers and 600 bus depot workers in Szczecinoffered to end their strike as soon as job security was guaranteedfor strikers.   ``This is an expression of support for Lech Walesa. We justwanted to follow his suggestions,'' said Balasz, explaining why theSzczecin workers were willing to end their strike.   The Szczecin port and bus depot and the July Manifesto mine werethe only facilities still on strike as of Friday.   Shipyard and port workers in Gdansk and steel workers in thesoutheastern city of Stalowa Wola ended strikes Thursday after theappeal from Walesa.   At a meeting Wednesday with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczakand Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek, Walensa's firstwith senior authorities since 1982, they agreed to discussSolidarity's future and other issues shortly after the strikesended, Walesa said.   Miners at the July Manifesto mine started to strike 19 days agoafter they received their paychecks. They demanded higher wages tocompensate for 60 percent inflation and incessant price inreases,and they also demanded better working conditions.   But like other strikers around the country, the No. 1 demand wasthe restoration of Solidarity's legal status.   Communist authorities first guaranteed the right to free tradeunions in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, giving rise toSolidarity. But the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union wassuppressed in the December 1981 martial law crackdown.   Although formally outlawed in October 1982 it has survived,first mainly as an underground organization and more openly inrecent years.</TEXT></DOC>
