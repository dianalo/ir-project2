Rafsanjani said hostage-taking is an ``inhuman action'' hat canproduce no positive political results. Eighteen Westerners,including eight Americans, are believed to be held by pro-Iraniangroups in Lebanon.   While Rafsanjani said his government was maintaining indirectcontacts with Washington, his offer and demands were not new.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Rafsanjani'scomments did not change the U.S. position.   ``We do not link the Iranian assets to the hostages and we donot make deals for hostages,'' he said.   Rafsanjani spoke at a three-hour news conference attended byabout 50 foreign media representatives issued visas specificallyfor the event. Sitting behind a small table in the high-ceilingedhall of the presidential office in downtown Tehran, Rafsanjanispoke in a soft voice, smiling frequently as he played with astring of worry beads.   Responding to a question from a U.S. reporter, Rafsanjani saidhe had proposed ``two methods'' that the United States could use tofacilitate release of the hostages:   ``The first is that as a sign of goodwill, you release ourassets. This is something that you will have to do, and sooner orlater you will be forced to do it. So do it now.   ``Secondly, if you do not want to give us our money, at leastyou can get your agents, your lackeys in Lebanon to release ourhostages. If you say they are not alive, at least you can give usback their bodies or show us their graves.''   The assets, estimated at at between $9 billion and $12 billion,have been frozen since the U.S. Embassy was seized by students inTehran in November 1979, nine months after the Islamic revolutionseized power, overthrowing the pro-Western monarchy.   Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen kidnapped the threeIranians in north Lebanon in July 1982. The missing are AhmadMotevaselian, commander of the contingent of Iranian RevolutionaryGuards based in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon; Iranian Charged'Affaires Hussein Musavi; and Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent forthe Islamic Republic News Agency.   Their Lebanese Shiite driver, Rastegar Moqadam, who also held anIranian passport, was grabbed with them at at a Lebanese Forcescheckpoint 25 miles north of Beirut. All four are believed dead.   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea said in August 1988 thatafter he took over the militia in 1986 he found no trace of themissing men and blamed his predecessor, Elie Hobeika, for theirdisappearance and apparent murder.   Geagea's disclosure was the first formal comment by the LebaneseForces that it had been involved in the seizure of the missingIranians.   Rafsanjani earlier had argued that the United States was keepingthe issue of the American hostages in Lebanon alive ``mainly as abridge in order to approach us and establish relations with theIslamic Republic of Iran, and this is a mistake.''   At one point during the news conference, Rafsanjani said: ``Thething is that your governments are not as much interested as youforeign journalists are in the question of hostages. You'd bettermake your governments interested in the matter.''   In addition to the Americans, the hostages are four Britons, twoWest Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. Held longestis American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Speaking through an interpreter, Rafsanjani made contradictorystatements on the hostage issue.   Though at one stage he said Iran could assist in the release ofthe hostages, he later declared that ``we do not want to becomeinvolved in this issue'' and denied that Iran could exert anyinfluence on the captors.   He admitted Iran has close relations with Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, widely believed to be behind the hostage taking. But hemaintained that the kidnappers were outside Hezbollah.   Asked about prospects of improving relations with Washington, hesaid there had been no direct contacts between the two governmentssince a secret visit by former U.S. National Security AdviserRobert McFarlane in 1986.   Three American hostages were released between November 1985 andSeptember 1986. In return, Iran secretly received weapons and spareparts from the United States.   ``But there have been indirect contacts,'' Rafsanjani said. ``Wehave received messages through two neighboring countries from theUnited States.'' He did not identify the countries.   ``In these messages they told us they have no ill-will toward usand want to solve the problem with us,'' he said. ``But we stillhave no confidence in what they say. We ask for signs andindications of goodwill on their part.''   Rafsanjani said these views had been relayed to the UnitedStates through the unspecified neighboring countries.   He ruled out any participation by U.S. corporations in Iran'spost-war reconstruction, saying: ``I don't think American companiescan play any role in Iran.''</TEXT></DOC>
