Thomas Cimeno, senior vice president of the Boston Fed,predicted to a group of economists meeting here, &quot;We'll haveenough failures to equal in {asset} size the failures we'vehad to date&quot; in 1991. He said that so far this year 36 NewEngland banks with combined assets of about $29 billion havefailed, with Bank of New England Corp.'s failure accountingfor about two-thirds of those assets.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cimeno emphasized that he isn't saying there will beanother large bank failure in the region, but that thefailure of &quot;20 mid-sized institutions isn't out of thequestion by any means. . . . That's not unreasonable.&quot;   His comments apparently are the first by a senior Fed bankofficial to publicly predict the magnitude of future failuresin the region. While the problems of New England banks arewell-known and analysts have forecast more failures,regulators traditionally have shied away from makingpredictions.   Mr. Cimeno didn't name any specific institutions, but hedid refer to publicly available information showing that mostof the largest independent banks in New Hampshire are introuble. &quot;New Hampshire is an absolute basket case. . . .It's pretty well understood that a lot of those companies areinsolvent or on the road to insolvencies,&quot; he said.   Some form of open-bank assistance -- in which acombination of public and private capital is injected into abank to return it to health without closing it -- is likelyin New Hampshire &quot;very soon,&quot; he noted. &quot;Open-bank assistanceis an idea whose time has come. . . . The FDIC (FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.) can take them one by one or dosomething more creative and less expensive to the {insurance}fund&quot; than closing the institutions and disposing of theassets, he said.   But New Hampshire alone doesn't have enough medium-sizedbanks to even approach Mr. Cimeno's estimated figure offuture bank failures of combined assets of nearly $30billion. The top five independent banks in New Hamsphire, allof them troubled, each have assets ranging from about $900million to $1.5 billion.   Bank analysts expect failures in other states,particularly Connecticut, which has more non-performingassets as a percentage of all loans -- 10.4% -- than anyother state in the nation.   Many banks in the region have posted steep losses in thepast couple of years as a result of mounting problems intheir real-estate loan portfolios. &quot;If New England were onebig bank, it would be a problem bank and it would be losingmoney,&quot; Mr. Cimeno noted, explaining that banks in the regionas a whole are losing money.   While he sees &quot;some very modest signs of improvement&quot; anddoesn't expect that non-performing assets in the region are&quot;going too much higher,&quot; Mr. Cimeno said he doesn't see aquick turnaround either. He added, &quot;It's not realistic toexpect much improvement {in earnings} at all in the next 12months. Eighteen to 24 {months} would be a better view.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
