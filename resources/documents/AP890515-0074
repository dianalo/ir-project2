Sunday's election marked Argentina's first transfer of powerbetween civilian governments in 61 years and capped a long comebackfor the populist Peronists, who had been banned for 25 of the past34 years.   With 90 percent of the vote counted, Menem received 7,206,916,or 47.2 percent, to the 5,663,175, or 37 percent garnered byMenem's strongest competitor, Eduardo Angeloz of the ruling RadicalCivic Union. There were 12 candidates in all.   Those votes earned Menem 309 of the 600 Electoral College votes,eight more than needed, according to projections by the independentnews agency, Diarios y Noticias.   Angeloz, Menem's former law school classmate, conceded defeat.   ``I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend,''Menem said.   Menem, the charismatic 58-year-old governor of La Riojaprovince, called for national unity immediately after declaringvictory.   The campaign had been divisive and he must cope with a countryin economic decline and a restive military.   ``I am not more capable than anyone else, but I'm not lesscapable,'' Menem said. ``The important thing is to get the countrymoving.''   The Interior Ministry estimated that 82 percent of the 20million eligible voters cast ballots.   Voters also chose a vice president, half the members of theChamber of Deputies, one senator, legislatures in 14 of thenation's 22 provinces and several thousand municipal officials.   In Sunday elections, Peronists took 66 of the 127 seats at stakein the National Chamber of Deputies and with 124 seats total,Peronists were just four seats short of a majority, according toDiarios y Noticias.   The Peronists already control the biggest bloc in the Senate andmost provincial legislatures and governorships.   The presidential inauguration was set for Dec. 10, the last dayof the six-year term of President Raul Alfonsin, who is barred bythe constitution from seeking re-election.   Alfonsin took office in December 1983, ending a brutal militarydictatorship that lasted nearly eight years.   Angeloz, 57, governor of Cordoba province, said he wished Menem``all the luck possible ... I leave defeated but will continueworking in my province and later I'll see what I can do on thenational level.''   Voting was calm and orderly in the South American nation of 31million. Some polling stations opened late and some lacked ballots,but there were no charges of fraud.   Polls had predicted that the center-left Peronist Party wouldwin. Party supporters danced in the streets outside Menem'scampaign headquarters in Buenos Aires even before victory wasassured.   Menem, who encourages people to call him ``Carlitos,'' isextremely popular among the working class.   Menem and Angeloz had offered different proposals for howArgentina _ once one of the world's wealthiest nations _ mightovercome a chronic budget deficit, triple-digit inflation, highunemployment and a $59 billion foreign debt.   Menem pledged to dramatically improve wages and said he mightnegotiate to suspend payments on the foreign debt.   He has spoken vaguely of a ``productive revolution'' and``social pact'' to spur employment, slash the budget deficit, raisethe value of the national currency and curtail inflation.   Angeloz, the candidate of the middle class, pledged to sellinefficient state industries, maintain a free exchange rate, spurexports and diminish the power of the 4 million-strong GeneralLabor Confederation union, the cornerstone of the Peronist Party.   Elements in the armed forces have staged three insurrectionsagainst Alfonsin. Menem endorsed the concept of ``reconciliation''but said he would not pardon officers convicted of human rightsabuses for their actions during the 1976-83 military dictatorship's``dirty war'' on leftist subversion, or block pending trials ofother officers.   The Peronist Party was founded by Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, whocame to power in 1946 and was ousted by a military coup in 1955.The military banned the party and jailed or exiled many of itsleaders until 1973, when Peron returned from Spain and was electedby an overwhelming margin.   Following his death on July 1, 1974, his wife, Isabel, took overas president. She was deposed by a coup in March 1976 and themilitary rulers jailed Menem.</TEXT></DOC>
