The regulations, which became effective Oct. 1, prohibitprescribing drugs commonly used to treat psychiatricdisorders for nursing-home patients unless the patients havebeen diagnosed with such maladies. The rules were establishedin response to broad concerns that such drugs are oftenprescribed not to treat illness, but simply to sedatetroublesome patients -- with sometimes harmful effect.</LP><TEXT>   In the latest study, researchers applied the newregulations to the practice at 60 nursing homes in eightwestern states between 1976 and 1985 to estimate the scope ofthe problem if the same practice patterns existed today.   They found that powerful tranquilizers were prescribed for17% to 21% of patients and that the medical records of halfof those patients showed no clinical justification for thedrugs. They also found that 59 of the 60 nursing homes had atleast one patient who would be ineligible for the treatmentunder the current rules.   &quot;We can't say if it's clinically inappropriate or justlousy documentation,&quot; said Judith Garrard, professor andpsychologist at the University of Minnesota's School ofPublic Health in Minneapolis, and lead author of the report.Either way, she said, if the study reflects currentconditions, &quot;I would say we have quite a task on our hands&quot;to remedy the problem.   By some measures, the rules, which were published severalmonths before taking effect, are already having an impact.William Kavesh, medical director of the PhiladelphiaGeriatric Center, said that 179 of 1,200 residents in sixPhiladelphia nursing homes were on antipsychotic drugs as oflast Oct. 1, down from 292 patients in January 1990.   &quot;There has been a significant reduction,&quot; said Dr. Kavesh,who organized a recent symposium on the new regulations forthe Gerontological Society of America. &quot;People are reportingsalutary effects&quot; for their patients. But he cautioned thatsome doctors are switching to Valium and other mildertranquilizers that also can have damaging consequences forolder patients. In addition, some doctors have vehementlyprotested the rules as interfering with their practice ofmedicine.   The study, published in today's Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, was funded by the U.S. Health CareFinancing Administration, which developed the newregulations. The findings were based on a review of a randomsample of 5,752 patients admitted to nursing homes and anadditional 3,191 patients who already were patients when thestudy began. Records were examined within two weeks ofadmission or at the beginning of the study period, and againwithin six weeks to two years.   The researchers looked at three drugs, Melleril, marketedby Sandoz Ltd., a Swiss drug company, Thorazine, sold bySmithKline Beecham PLC, London, and Haldol, made by theMcNeil Pharmaceutical unit of Johnson andamp; Johnson, NewBrunswick, N.J. Together, they make up 78% of such drugs usedin nursing homes, the study says.</TEXT></DOC>
