Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said before the House voted,371-43, to approve the bill.   However, President Bush and many Republicans say Congress mustdo more than pass a mere statute, and they have been pressing for aconstitutional amendment to outlaw flag destruction or desecration.The Senate will take up that issue next week.   Still, 154 Republicans joined 217 Democrats in supporting thestatutory ban on Thursday, while only 18 Republicans and 25Democrats opposed it. The bill passed the Senate 91-9.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the WhiteHouse had not yet received the bill but when it arrives ``we'llhave to have a legal review take place.''   Fitzwater declined to say whether Bush would veto it or sign it.However, administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity,said the president was expected to let it go into effect withouthis signature.   ``The president obviously agrees with its general purpose butfeels a constitutional amendment is required to survive legalchallenges,'' Fitzwater said of the bill.   Bush said last week that a new statute would not be adequate toget around the Supreme Court decision, which threw out theconviction of a Texas flag burner.   Bush backed earlier congressional proposals for a constitutionalamendment but Congress scrapped them in favor of the legislativeapproach.   The bill on its way to Bush would revise existing federal lawand provide up to a year in a jail and a $1,000 fine for anyone who``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns,maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of theUnited States.''   The one-sided votes in Congress reflected the power of the flagas a political symbol, as demonstrated by a public outcry followingthe Supreme Court decision in June.   Derrick told the House that the court's decision, throwing outthe conviction of Texas flag burner Gregory Lee Johnson on groundsthat his right to free speech was violated, hit Americans like ``aslap in the face.''   Bush joined the call for a constitutional amendment, butDemocratic leaders said changing the Constitution would be toodrastic an action in response to an isolated case.   ``Amending the Constitution as some would advance should be alast resort and not a first resort,'' said Rep. William J. Hughes,D-N.J. He said the issue should ``be addressed in a much lessdramatic manner.''   However, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said, ``Tothose who believe we can overturn a Supreme Court decision at thistime by statute, I can only repeat the immortal words of the farmerwho, asked directions, said, `you can't get there from here.'''   Supporters of the bill approved Thursday said the wording hadbeen carefully fashioned to withstand court challenges, banningflag defacement regardless of whether it involved political protest.   ``It is the act of harming the physical integrity of the flagrather than any message that the action might convey that is to bepunished,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, toldthe House.   Brooks said the bill has been framed in a ``content neutralmanner.''   But that idea drew scoffing from some Republicans, who said thatany bill to ban flag burning by simple statute would be overturnedfor the same reasons as the Texas case.   ``Approval of this bill will send a fatally flawed statute ...to the president of the United States,'' said Rep. JamesSensenbrenner, R-Wis.   Sensenbrenner pointed in particular to an amendment attached bythe Senate last week at the urging of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Itadded the words ``physically defiles'' to the list of prohibitedacts.   Critics said anyone who physically defiled the flag wouldobviously have an attitude toward it and thus the measure would endup punishing political protest, no matter how carefully sponsorsmay have sought to avoid it.   As in the Senate, many House lawmakers clearly planned to votefor both the bill and the constitutional amendment, a strategyconsidered politically safe.   A number of Republicans who voted against the bill, calling itinadequate, were joined by a smattering of Democrats who said thatneither the amendment nor the bill should be approved.</TEXT></DOC>
