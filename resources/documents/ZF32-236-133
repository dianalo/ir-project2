 At $199, XPort is small in bothconception and performance.andM;With support limited to CGM, DXF and GEM (in addition to Micrografx's ownproprietary DRW format), XPort fails to convert two of the most important PCvector graphics standards: EPS and .WMF.andP;  The latter omission is especiallymystifying because XPort runs under Windows and should support its nativefile format.andP;  It's the only one of these programs that attempts to tackle thevector information in Macintosh Pict files.andP;  But on-screen file viewing,direct printer output, and clipboard support are all absent.andM;Because Micrografx chose to remove many of the program's processingparameters from user control, Xport is also short on some importantconversion options.andP;  Though it converts text in editable form from one formatto another, the system by which it matches equivalent fonts is notuser-definable.andP;  And XPort always gives you the highest number of colors fromthe source file that the destination file can support; you can't selectivelyconvert a color image to gray scale or black and white.andM;SIMPLICITYandM;The options that XPort does offer are easy to use, though, thanks to thesimplicity of XPort's interface.andP;  And its batch processing mode isexceptionally flexible.andP;  A list box contains all of the files you have chosento translate.andP;  Each item in the list box can contain different file types(both for input and output), as well as different subdirectory locations, anddifferent processing options-a great help in batch operations.andP;  One simplepreference setting lets you save any error messages that may be generated toan error log for future inspection.andM;To translate a file, you simply choose the source file type from the Inputmenu, the destination file type from the Output menu, and the variousprocessing options from the Setup menu.andP;  Most of the options areself-explanatory, and vary according to the file format; for instance, youcan choose to export either Artline or Draw flavors of GEM, and either Pict1or Pict2 flavors of the Macintosh standard.andP;  Others control the tradeoffbetween image accuracy and file size; for instance, if you opt to simulatethe symbols in a source file as polygons, you can generate more precise (butlarger) destination file.andM;Appropriately, XPort pays the most attention to CGM and DXF files.andP;  If yourgraphics program proves to be incompatible with one of the five flavors ofCGM that XPort can read and write (CALS, Lotus Freelance, Harvard Graphics,PageMaker, or Zenographics' Pixie), you can create and edit an custom versionof the file specification by choosing between abstract or metric scalingmodes, direct or indexed color specification, and 16-, 32-, or 64-bitcoordinate systems.andP;  Creating your own flavor of CGM in this way doesn'trequire that you understand the programming concepts behind all thesechoices.andP;  All you really have to do is to ask the tech support department ofthe company that makes your software to tell you whether you have clicked onthe right radio buttons.andM;TRANSLATION PROBLEMSandM;In theory, XPort allows you to determine the quality of a simulated curve ina CGM destination file.andP;  In our tests, however, this feature didn't work.andO;The Bezier curve in our .GEM test file was recreated by XPort as the sameseries of coarse lines, regardless of whether the option was set at thelowest,(1) or highest (10) quality level.I also found XPort's use ofdifferent CGM sizing methods confusing.andP;  For CGM input, you must understandhow to manipulate preset resolutions, but for output you must specifypercentages instead.andP;  XPort's Macintosh Pict conversion was also highlyproblematic in practice.andP;  A patch provided by the vendor helped the initialquality problems, but did not fix them entirely.andM;Though XPort does not support three-dimensional objects in DXF files(converting 3-D files results in strange, ghostly shapes), it does supply ahost of other options.andP;  The DXF file format supports the use of externalshape libraries, and XPort can use these.andP;  It accepts dimensioninginformation, lets you reverse black and white to improve legibility, and letsyou show invisible lines and block attributes.andM;Even for the formats it does support, XPort is a questionable value.andP;  Itfails to take full advantage of the Windows environment, and the results ofour test conversions, especially those from the Macintosh Pict format, weresometimes of inferior quality.andP;  XPort's basic conversion functions are aduplicate of those found in Micrografx's other products, Designer andCharisma.andP;  On their own, they're hardly worth $199.andM;PROBLEMS OF VECTOR CONVERSION: Two ExamplesandM;Though vector images are made up of the basic entities, the gritty detailscan cause problems in conversion.andM;THROWING CGM A CURVE The better vector drawing programs on the market todayuse Bezier curves, a highly efficient method of describing free-form curvesmathematically.andP;  But older formats like CGM and HPGL don't support Beziercurves.andP;  When images are translated into these formats, such curves must besimulated by using a series of arcs or line segments.andP;  This greatly increasesthe number of objects in the file, as each curve  defined by just two anchorpoints and two control points) is replaced with a large number of tinysegments.andM;To cut down on file sizes, vector conversion utilities allow you to choosethe quality of the curve-that is, to control the relative number of segmentsthat will be used to simulate it.andP;  With Hijaak's CGM export facility, forinstance, you can choose curve qualities ranging from ultrafine to coarse.andO;The highest quality setting produces results that look very close to theoriginal (Figure 1), but such a file can be monstrous in size.andP;  Reducing thequality setting to medium (Figure 2) cuts down the number of objects, but atthe cost of less-than-appetizing appearance.andP;  Until Bezier or other complexcurves are widely supported in standard vector file formats, however, thisdilemma is inescapable.andM;TROUBLE WITH FILLSandM;Gradient fills are widely used in slides, adding interest to backgrounds andaccents to foreground objects.andP;  A vector format that supports gradient fillsneeds to store only the starting and ending color, and the direction or typeof shading.andP;  The target application or output device then derives the properfill at the highest resolution and number of colors it is capable ofhandling.andM;Since CGM files don't understand gradient fills, vector file-conversionprograms have to improvise when converting them to this format.andP;  The mostcommon method is to replace a filled object with a large number of smallerobjects, each with a slightly different color.andP;  This greatly increases thenumber of objects that must be stored in the file, since a single fillattribute is replaced by a large number of narrow rectangles or concentriccircles.andP;  The results often have an unpleasant banded quality, which is alltoo apparent regardless of the quality of the output device.andP;  Gradient fillson irregular objects (Figure 3) can also cause problems when converted to CGMformat; notice how the fill in the CGM file (Figure 4) does not stay withinthe bounds of the irregular shape but appears as a rectangle superimposed onthe outline.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
