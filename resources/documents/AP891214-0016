There was no indication of who fired the grenades, whichexploded about noon at the Seafront compound. But the incidentoccurred following threats against U.S. interests by rebel soldierswhose coup attempt failed last week.   A U.S. Embassy statement said the grenades were fired``indiscriminately'' at the compound, which includes the Americanclub, an embassy commissary and housing areas for embassy andmilitary personnel.   Embassy spokesman David Andriessen said Americans had beenwarned to avoid travel to the embassy compound and other U.S.installations in the capital for the next few hours.   During the recent coup attempt, hundreds of American familieswere evacuated to Seafront to escape fighting between mutineers andgovernment forces in the financial district, Makati.   Rebels who sought to topple President Corazon Aquino expressedanger at the United States after American F-4 Phantom jets flew aircover for government forces on Dec.1, the first day of the coupattempt.   U.S. jets did not fire a shot but their presence was consideredcrucial in turning the tide against mutineers, who had launched airattacks against Malacanang Palace and military camps.   Rebels gave up their last position Saturday when about 400mutineers surrendered at an air base near Cebu, 350 miles south ofthe capital.   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said remnants of therebel force still retain the capability to launch ``terroristattacks, sabotage and assassination.''   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of the Capital Command, saidthere ``are indications that they are moving'' toward terrorism tocontinue the struggle against Mrs. Aquino.   ``I hope they will be reasonable enough that they will be men ofconscience,'' Aguirre said. ``They should not resort to terroristacts that will prejudice innocent lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
