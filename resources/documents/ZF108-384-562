 But AppleShare'srequirement of a dedicated Macintosh has irked network managers who feelthey're wasting budget dollars buying an expensive machine with a graphicalinterface tailored for individual use to do a multi-user network job.andM;Nowadays network managers have several choices besides a dedicated Macintoshwhen setting up an AFP file server.andP;  One of the most intriguing is DaynaNET,a hardware and software product from Dayna Communications Inc. that convertsan IBM PC- or AT-compatible into a serviceable AFP file server.andM;We evaluated the DaynaNET file server for several weeks to see how it wouldfly on large, mixed networks of Macs and PCs.andM;How it works.andP;  From the user's perspective, DaynaNET works almost like anAppleShare file server.andP;  The Chooser is used to select the server from itszone, and a normal user name and password are entered to gain access.andP;  Aftera server volume is selected, it mounts on the desktop and may be used likeany shared volume on a Macintosh.andM;Dayna pulled off this neat trick by putting an AppleShare face onto a Novellfile server.andP;  Novell Inc. is the leader in IBM PC LAN file servers, providingclient and server interfaces for a variety of hardware and softwareenvironments.andP;  In the past couple of years Novell has concentrated onpromoting its LAN server software, NetWare, as a common denominator betweenPCs, Macs, VAXes, Unix workstations and mainframes.andP;  NetWare is currently thede facto LAN standard.andM;DaynaNET's masquerade is accomplished by special AFP translators written byDayna.andP;  These translators monitor network activity and convert any AFP callsdirected at the server into Novell NetWare calls.andP;  Thus, either AFP orNetWare may be used to access a DaynaNET file server, providing a common fileenvironment for both the PC and Mac.andM;Documentation, installation.andP;  The multivolume DaynaNET documentation guidedus through the installation process without any problems.andP;  The instructionswere well-written, and graphics and example screens were used effectively.andO;Although we felt that some of the documents could have been combined, wefound that the documentation set was well-designed to support the needs ofboth user and network administrator.andP;  However, Dayna did not provide a quickreference card or &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for use by clients.andM;We tested the $3,595 DaynaNET XL, which supports up to 100 users on aLocalTalk network.andP;  Smaller four- and eight-user licenses also are availablefor less than $2,000.andP;  The $3,995 XLE version supports a direct connection toEthernet.andP;  All prices include the appropriate network adapter card.andM;The version of NetWare used in Dayna-NET, 2.15, requires at least an IBM PC-or AT-compatible computer with an 80286 processor.andP;  The hard disks on theserver are reformatted to a special format that only NetWare understands.andO;Besides functioning as a file server, DaynaNET servers also can handle othernetworking chores, such as print spooling and bridging Ethernet and LocalTalknetworks, through software add-ons.andM;The installation process begins by reformatting all the disk drives that areinstalled in the server computer.andP;  NetWare formats the disk with its own filestructure, bypassing DOS' 32-Mbyte limit, and performs several extensivetests on the disk media.andP;  If you select all the recommended testingparameters, this process can take several hours on a 90-Mbyte drive.andP;  Weallowed the media surface tests to work overnight.andM;We had problems trying to get the server to boot with only 2 Mbytes of RAM.andO;After calling Dayna we learned that 2 Mbytes is truly the minimum amount ofRAM that can be used.andP;  And a server with only 2 Mbytes will not support theuse of multiple network adapter cards or any add-on software options.andP;  Werecommend 3 Mbytes of RAM as the practical minimum for multifunction DaynaNETservers.andP;  After a RAM upgrade, installation proceeded without a problem.andM;Administration.andP;  AppleShare requires a network administrator to physicallyaccess the server console to add users and perform other maintenance chores.andO;A nice feature of DaynaNET is its ability to perform user and securitymaintenance from a client Mac.andP;  The NetWare Control Center applicationprovides an easy-to-use, Maclike user interface to define new users, updateuser information, create new groups and assign users to groups.andM;Although NetWare and AFP are similar enough for one to masquerade as theother, there are many features of NetWare that have no analog in AFP.andP;  Thesefeatures include some rather sophisticated security settings and thecapability to create a &quot;trustee&quot; privilege on a folder.andP;  Trustee rightsenable administrators to vary a user's security status on a folder-by-folderbasis.andM;Dayna supports all the NetWare security features with a special file thatneeds to be copied into each user's System folder and with a desk accessory.andO;Although the NetWare DA is not required, Dayna recommends you install it onclient Macs.andP;  Unfortunately, the need to install additional software on eachclient eliminates some of the convenience of using an AFP server.andM;Performance.andP;  We compared the performance of our DaynaNET file server runningon a 20-MHz AST Premium 386 with that of an AppleShare server running on aMac SE/30.andP;  Our main test consisted of copying a 2.3-Mbyte folder with manysubfolders from the server to a client Mac and then copying it back again.andO;This test evaluates the real-world tasks of disk reads and writes,transmitting data across the network, and creating complex directorystructures on the fly.andM;Over LocalTalk it took about two minutes, 40 seconds to copy the test folderfrom either the AppleShare or DaynaNET server to our local hard disk.andP;  Ittook about the same time to copy the folder from the local disk to theSE/30-based AppleShare server.andP;  Copying the same folder from the client Macto the Dayna-NET server took more than four minutes.andM;We tested DaynaNET's AFP compatibility with a number of tasks, including thecommon case of trying to access a single file from two separate clients usingMicrosoft Corp.'s Word and Wingz from Informix Software Inc.andP;  Our tests weresuccessful, producing appropriate error messages that the file was busy.andM;Conclusions.andP;  We found DaynaNET to be a well-documented file server systemthat performed within expectations.andP;  Dayna's technical support was more thanadequate, which will be of some importance to Mac administrators trying tomanage a PC-based server.andM;We were not too fond of the security enhancements added by working in theNetWare environment; supporting these additional features probably willcomplicate the installation of DaynaNET on a network of users alreadyfamiliar with AppleShare.andP;  In our tests, DaynaNET's performance was almostequal to that of an AppleShare server but suffered when writing newinformation to disk.andP;  This result did not surprise us much, based on previousexperience with NetWare and Mac clients.andM;Using an AFP-compatible NetWare-based server will benefit managers who needto share information between IBM PCs and Macs.andP;  This integration is what youare buying if you choose DaynaNET over the much less expensive AppleShare,although there is considerable cost savings in hardware when buying a'386-based IBM PC-compatible over a similarly powerful Macintosh.andM;Dayna Communications Inc. is located at 50 S.
