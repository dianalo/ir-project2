Under the review, one of a series of Air Force assessments of defense contractors, the division was rated marginal in product integrity, quality assurance, manufacturing and contract management.    The Air Force said the San Jose, Calif.-based unit's engineering problems involved &quot;weak program management,&quot; late deliveries and a lack of aggressive corrective actions.    A spokesman for the unit said it &quot;is taking or has completed corrective action in all areas in which we were considered to be deficient by the audit team.&quot;    The unit makes parts for the space shuttle and for the Tomahawk, Minuteman, Trident and Titan missile programs. Of 162 parts that were checked, 20% didn't meet Air Force standards, the report said.    A spokesman for the parent company said: &quot;Most of the defects noted in the core review were minor in nature and wouldn't have resulted in missile failure.&quot;    Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies makes jet engines, helicopters, elevators and defense products. </TEXT></DOC>
