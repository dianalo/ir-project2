Some of the criteria given for the studywere that it be designed with the potential for cogeneration, stagedto match the growth phases of the Township, designed to employ initiallyoil-fired boilers and then coal-fired boilers of specified outputs, andcompared with alternative, conventional energy sources for the supplyof heating. The financial analysis was performed by computer using avery flexible arrangement of inputs and programme enabling the effectof varying the major parameters to be studied. Capital costs were estimatedusing proposals from equipment suppliers, operating costs took into accountfuel prices, transport, labor and materials. The power plant design decribedin this report is based on good, thermal power engineering principleswith suitable plant redundancy to meet upset and partial load conditions.The distribution system uses loops to ensure minimal supply disruption.The results of the study show that district heating has a positive netpresent worth of several million dollar if the energy is sold at thesame equivalent cost as electricity. Alternatively the energy could besold at at price 82-92% of that of electricity with the project self-financing.This shows that district heating of Tumbler Ridge is feasible to theTownship, providing the margin is sufficient to offset any cost to consumersfor more expensive on-premises heating equipment. Substantially greatermargins appear achievable through reduction in capital cost and/or fuelprice, financing consumer equipment similar to the rest of the project,and cogeneration. 17 figs., 35 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
