The board meeting, which began Tuesday, had been scheduled to resume yesterday.    Meanwhile, the union representing Pan Am's pilots announced it had reached a tentative settlement on a new contract with the company. As previously reported, the Air Line Pilots Association agreed to wage and cost concessions amounting to savings of $55 million a year for three years.    The union representing Pan Am's flight engineers was also negotiating with Pan Am management yesterday, and a union source said an agreement was expected.    Braniff Chairman Jay A. Pritzker and his family control 94% of Braniff's voting stock. Braniff's offer to acquire Pan American World Airways would give union employees 20% of the merged airline's stock in exchange for wage savings of $200 million a year over four years. </TEXT></DOC>
