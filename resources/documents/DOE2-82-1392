Examples of abruptclimate changes, occurring within several years or decades, are presented.Water vapor contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect. Its contentincreased in parts of the tropics during the last 20 years by 20-30%,probably as a result of a warming of the sea surface. Stronger releaseof latent heat leads to a warming of the tropical atmosphere, which isalso observed. This may indicate that - opposite to results of many climatemodels - the signal of the greenhouse effect is to be found in the tropicsfirst, instead of the high latitudes.</TEXT></DOC>
