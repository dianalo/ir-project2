Hundreds of riot police in green fatigues and black visoredhelmets detained the students as they marched toward the U.S. 8thArmy headquarters in southern Seoul. The students, who tried tostage a peaceful sit-down protest, were forced into police buses.   The dissidents also demonstrated to mark the 35th anniversarytoday of the end of the Korean War, begun in 1950 by communistNorth Korea's invasion of the south.   About 1,000 students and dissidents later marched toward theU.S. Embassy after a rally at Korea University.   Thousands of riot police followed the march through the city andblocked the students' way less than a mile from the embassy. Therewere no clashes and police persuaded the protesters to move into anearby park.   Forces from the United States and 15 other nations intervened onthe side of South Korea during the war and China fought alongsidethe north. The war ended July, 27, 1953 in stalemate with the twosides signing an armistice.   The students called for removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops stillbased in South Korea under a defense treaty, and they carriedbanners denouncing the American military presence.   ``Down with the United States, which forced partition of theKorean peninsula,'' protesters shouted.   Radical students claim the United States is responsible for thecontinued division of the Korean Peninsula and rules the south as avirtual colony. Radicals have called for immediate reunificationwith the communist north.   Most South Koreans fear the north remains determined to conquerthe south and are vehemently opposed to the totalitarian regime inthe north. The radicals have virtually no public support.   The peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet forces that endedthe Japanese occupation at the end of World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
