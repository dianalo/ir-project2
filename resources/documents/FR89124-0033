Therefore, we are proposing to add thefacility operated by Stevedoring Service of America, located at 3615 11thAvenue SW., Seattle, WA 98134, as an animal export inspection facilityat the port of Seattle, Washington.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>The telephone number of Seattle's existing animal export inspection facility,operated by Sandamp;W Export Ltd., is incorrectly listed in andSection; 91.14as (206) 248-2360. We are proposing to correct the number to read (206)241-1837.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Period</ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that this rulemaking procedure should be expeditedby allowing a 15-day comment period on this proposal. Stevedoring Serviceof America meets the requirements contained in andSection; 91.14(c) for approvalas an animal export inspection facility. The addition of this facilityshould be made promptly in order to inform exporters so that they can makeappropriate plans to export their animals, and avoid unnecessary restrictionson the exportation of animals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.The addition of another animal export inspection facility at the port ofSeattle, Washington, would facilitate the export of livestock from theUnited States. However, we believe the addition of this facility wouldhave little or no economic impact on animal exporters, the majority ofwhom are small businesses. The primary impact would be the increased convenienceof having two animal export facilities from which to choose.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this proposal contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with state and local officials.
