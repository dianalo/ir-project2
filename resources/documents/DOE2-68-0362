A fundamental question is whether themarker, for example, HLA-B27 in the case of ankylosing spondylitis, isthe protein molecule directly affecting incidence of the disease or whetherthe gene for the serologic marker is linked to an unidentified gene whoseproduct is more directly responsible for disease propensity. The possibilitythat a nearby gene in linkage disequilibrium with a particular serologicmarker is actually involved in the disease process is enhanced by theobservation, in both mouse and man, that extended clusters of genes maybe inherited together with less frequent crossover than predicted fromestimated genetic distance. To provide a basis for investigating thesepossibilities, the authors undertook the cloning and characterizationof the class I major histocompatibility genes of man.</TEXT></DOC>
