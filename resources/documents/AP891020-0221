The pilots union at UAL's United Airlines, which along withmanagement is leading the buyout attempt, quickly announced it wasdeveloping a new plan that would include for the first timeUnited's flight attendants as partners.   But some analysts and United's Machinists union, which hasopposed the buyout plan, said British Airway's departure may doomthe proposal.   In a brief statement Friday in London, British Airways said it``does not intend to participate in any new deal for theacquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future.'' It didn't givereasons, but said its marketing agreement with United would remainin effect.   ``We're obviously disappointed. However, we do plan to moveahead with our new partners, the flight attendants, who joined withus yesterday,'' said Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the Unitedchapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. ALPA represents 7,000of United's 70,000 workers.   The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 14,000workers at United, issued a statement saying it would participatewith ALPA and UAL management in discussions about any new proposal.   Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL, said the companyhad no comment on British Airways' withdrawal.   The original pilot-management buyout proposal approved by UAL'sboard of directors called for UAL workers to own 75 percent of thecompany, management 10 percent and British Airways 15 percent.   It would have been the largest employee-led buyout of a U.S.company.   British Airways' announcement came one week after thepilot-management group said it had failed to secure financing forits original $6.75 billion, $300-a-share offer, contributing to aFriday the 13th selloff on Wall Street that resurrected fears ofthe 1987 stock market crash.   While the stock market overall has rebounded since last week,UAL shares have continued spiraling lower, reflecting growingpessimism among investors that any debt-financed takeover proposalof the airline will succeed.   UAL tumbled $21.62{ to finish at $168.50 a share Friday in NewYork Stock Exchange trading, bringing its decline for the week toabout $110.   Airline analysts in London were pessimistic about the remainingpartners' chances for success.   ``For the time being, I think it's dead, to be honest,'' saidNick Cunningham, of the investment firm Laing and Cruickshank.   A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists andAerospace Workers at United agreed.   ``It was not a viable proposal that would have done theemployees any good,'' said spokesman Jim Conley from the Washingtonheadquarters of the union, which represents 25,000 United workers.   ``We're hoping that'll be the end of it,'' said Conley, whoseunion has maintained the pilot-management proposal would saddle UALwith a dangerous debt load.   But airline analyst Stephen Dexter, of Kemper Financial ServicesInc. in Chicago, said British Airways may not necessarily havepulled out for good.   He said British Airways, which prides itself on being afirst-class carrier, is unaccustomed to the indignity of whipsawingtakeover efforts.   But ``they have invested very, very heavily in theirrelationship with United,'' Dexter said.</TEXT></DOC>
