A revised 1,000 barrel, or 42,000 U.S. gallon, Brent Blend North Sea crude-futures contract will trade June 23, said Derek Whiting, exchange chairman. Brent is the international benchmark oil for crudes traded in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.    Mr. Whiting said it will be &quot;the best instrument for trading and hedging oil in the international market.&quot; West Texas Intermediate, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange is &quot;only a domestic oil&quot; that applies to U.S. producers and consumers, he said.    The exchange introduced Brent crude-oil futures in November 1985. That contract was such a dismal failure that dealings became virtually dormant, dealers said. &quot;The timing was wrong; the contract began trading just before the oil-price collapse in late 1985 and early 1986,&quot; said Peter Wildblood, chief executive of the exchange.    The exchange is also offering trading permits at $1,000 each to 35 &quot;locals,&quot; or floor speculators, on the condition that they actively speculate in the market.    The introduction of &quot;locals&quot; should increase liquidity on the exchange and encourage producers and consumers around the world to trade crude-oil futures in London, Mr. Wildblood said.    New York Merc officials weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
