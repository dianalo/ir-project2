U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch rejected the DefenseDepartment's attempt to have the suit by Joseph C. Steffan thrownout of court.   Steffan, of Warren, Minn., resigned from the academy in March1987, six weeks before he was scheduled to graduate. He had beenthe subject of an investigation of his alleged homosexuality.   He told academy officials that he was a homosexual and was toldthat service officials would seek his dismissal. Instead, heresigned.   Steffan is seeking to be readmitted to the Naval Academy inAnnapolis, Md. His suit seeks to have declared unconstitutional theacademy's regulations barring homosexuals.   Gasch's order offered no opinion on the merits of Steffan's case.   The Navy had sought an order from Gasch throwing the case out ofcourt because the service claimed Steffan had voluntarily resignedand also had not exhausted all his administrative remedies.   But Gasch said the resignation was not truly voluntary becauseSteffan resigned in the face of pressure from academy officials.   Sandra Lowe, Steffan's attorney, said ``I am delighted with theruling because it means we can now argue the case on its merits.''   Navy officials, asked for comment, did not immediately returntelephone calls.</TEXT></DOC>
