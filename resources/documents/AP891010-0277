Fred C. Lee, a fugitive believed to be in Taiwan, was chargedwith 493 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, securities fraud, wirefraud and fraud in connection with a tender offer.   The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattanalmost a year ago but remained under seal as investigatorscontinued their search for Lee, U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said.   The $16.5 million in illegal profits described in the indictmentmakes the case the second largest insider-trading case behind theIvan Boesky scandal in 1986. Boesky, the now-jailed stockspeculator, agreed to return $50 million in alleged illicit profitsand pay $50 million in penalties to the government.   Authorities decided to unseal the charges against Lee in hopespublicity surrounding the case would help apprehend him, Romanosaid. He added that the United States does not have an extraditiontreaty with Taiwan covering the offenses in the indictment.   Lee faces up to five years in prison on each of the 493 criminalcharges and tens of millions of dollars in fines, Romano said.   The prosecutor also said Lee, through his attorneys, agreed topay $25 million to settle a civil complaint brought by theSecurities and Exchange Commission in June.   Lee, 39, was accused of paying the Morgan Stanley analyst,Stephen S. Wang Jr., $200,000 for non-public information aboutupcoming mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts involvingcompanies represented by the investment firm.   The indictment identified 16 deals between June 1987 and July1988, long after the Wall Street insider trading scandal madeheadlines, in which Lee earned more than $16.5 million.   Lee allegedly carried out the illegal transactions by trading inmore than 40 accounts at eight foreign and domestic brokers, theindictment said. Some accounts were in Lee's name but most werelisted in the names of relatives and other third parties.   Wang entered into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors inSeptember 1988 and pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud inconnection with his scheme with Lee.   Wang, 25, who no longer works for Morgan Stanley, originally wassentenced to three years in prison but his term was reduced toeight months and he was recently released.   He joined Morgan Stanley in June 1988, working in leveragedbuyouts before transferring to mergers and acquisitions.</TEXT></DOC>
