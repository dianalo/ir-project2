In recent weeks, price tags on some personal computers have dropped as much as 35%, continuing an industry trend of bringing consumers increasingly powerful computers for less money, while some mail-order companies already offering cut-rate machines are sharply boosting service.    Much of the impetus for the latest round comes from International Business Machines Corp., which last month slashed prices for several existing machines to clear the shelves for a series of new products. The move unleashed price cuts by several makers of IBM-compatible computers, the so-called clones, while other companies have shaved prices recently because improved technology or production efficiencies have lowered their costs.    The action shows how &quot;the PC industry has been continually able to offer declining prices for a given level of capability,&quot; says Peter Teige, a microcomputer market analyst for Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif.-based unit of Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. &quot;IBM just gave further momentum to the downward movement of prices.&quot;    Bargain hunters will face some dilemmas, however, and not all prices are falling. Some of the deepest cuts are for older IBM clones, but some of those machines won't be powerful enough to run the new industry-standard software being planned for IBM's new Personal Service/2 line. Moreover, while some prices may decrease further, the overall cost of computing, especially for corporate customers, may rise somewhat, reflecting pricier and more sophisticated new machines.    Most of the cuts appear to be concentrated among mid-priced-clone producers, including Wyse Technology, Tandon Corp. and Leading Edge Hardware Products Inc. Wyse, which unveiled new products of its own earlier this month, marked down older models by as much as 20%. Tandon, citing lower overhead and costs from offshore production, made reductions of as much as 25%. Like many producers, Leading Edge is equipping machines with new features, such as expanded memory, instead of making major cuts, but the strategy hasn't been entirely successful.    &quot;It is a domino effect,&quot; says John Sullivan, marketing vice president for Canton, Mass.-based Leading Edge. &quot;We have to cut prices to protect market share.&quot; Raising prices would be &quot;ludicrous,&quot; he says, and there are even signs of further erosion. IBM, which lopped as much as 35% off certain machines, just last week marked down one of the discounted models for a second time.    But some prices haven't budged. Tandy Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. have held prices firm, citing strong demand. And prices have held steady at Apple Computer Inc., which isn't directly affected by swings in the IBM-compatible market. Prices also haven't fallen enough to force reductions among mail-order companies, which offer the cheapest machines, but these firms are taking other steps to lure new customers.    &quot;Their pricing still isn't in our ballpark,&quot; says Michael Dell, president of PC's Limited Inc., an Austin, Texas, mail-order firm whose prices are still about a third of the IBM level, even after the latest cuts. Nonetheless, last month the firm offered customers on-site service for the first time for a minor fee.    The price cuts also are bolstering already strong personal-computer sales this year. Several dealers say sales have picked up recently, indicating that many businesses were putting buying plans on hold until the IBM announcement. &quot;There is a very strong run on the old technology,&quot; says Seymour Merrin, a Southport, Conn., consultant and former retailer.    For first-time buyers, however, the price cuts and the myriad number of manufacturers can be befuddling. Sellers are offering different features to distinguish their machines from competitors, which makes comparison-shopping difficult. Moreover, there appear to be inconsistencies within some companies' own product lines.    IBM, for example, still sells a version of its PC-XT that includes 640,000 characters of memory and a 20 million-character hard-disk drive for $2,660. But even the company says its new Model 30 PC, which includes similar features, is a better buy at $2,295.    Tandon and Wyse offer less-expensive versions of the PC-XT, with the hard disk but just 256,000 characters of memory. At $1,399, Tandon's price is about $500 less than the Wyse machine, but Wyse says its version is faster. All the machines include keyboards; but monitors are extra, often beginning at about $200.    Leading Edge, meanwhile, undercuts both, pitching a $1,495 machine with double the memory and a TV monitor -- a 17% price reduction compared with last fall. Several mail-order companies continue to sell similar packages for less than $1,000.    But even as prices decline, some consumers are looking at features other than price in making their choices. Nancy Krause, director of finance and operations at the Institute for Transpersonal Psychology, a Menlo Park, Calif., graduate school, bought Leading Edge through a dealer because she was a first-time buyer, &quot;knew absolutely nothing about computers&quot; and needed quicker service than mail-order firms could provide.    The cheaper machines present other potential pitfalls. The price cuts continue to bring powerful machines once aimed for office use well within the budget of individuals, but not all of the machines are configured for fun. Analysts say buyers with children who want to play games should keep an eye on such features as color monitors and graphics, joy sticks and game ports, which are usually optional.    In addition, many consumers will have to wrestle with obsolescence. Because it isn't as powerful as the new IBM machines, the PC-XT and its clones won't be able to run state-of-the-art software in the future. However, &quot;plenty of situations don't require the most advanced systems,&quot; says Mr. Teige of Dataquest. With literally tens of thousands of software programs written, the older models &quot;should be enough to carry most people well into the 1990s.&quot;    Adds Chuck Peddle, Tandon's sales chief: &quot;There will always be a new and more wonderful computer.&quot;    ---                  Recent Price Cuts                        New       Old           % Model                Price      Price      Change IBM XT 268*          $1395      $2145        35% Tandon PCA-20**       1999       2495        20 Wyse SY-2200-20***         2499       2999        17 Leading Edge D#       1495       1795        17 *Includes 256 kilobytes of memory and one 360 kilobytefloppy disk drive. **IBM PC AT-compatible with one megabyteof memory and 20 megabyte hard disk drive. ***IBM PC AT-compatible with 640 kilobytes of memory and 20megabyte hard disk drive. #IBM PC AT-compatible with 512 kilobytes of memory, 20megabyte hard disk drive.
