<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-0840 </DOCNO><TEXT>A three-dimensional CAD system for plant layout of nuclear power plantshas been developed, adopting the latest technologies of knowledge engineering,CAD/CAM, and interactive computer graphics. With this system, Hitachiis now able to plan plant layout more effectively, reduce design timeand cost, and detect defective designs before actual construction problemsoccur. Hitachi is planning to enhance this three-dimensional CAD systemto a plant total life computer-aided engineering (CAE) system. This systemwill include a construction CAE system, a test operation and in-serviceinspection control system, and a plant maintenance system. After completionof this system, Hitachi will be able to plan, monitor, and control allmajor aspects in the life of a nuclear power plant from the very firststage of the planning to its decommissioning.</TEXT></DOC>
