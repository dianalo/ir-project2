The tax would beexpected to raise $3.9 million for the district's operating budget in threeyears. At the end of that time, it would need to be resubmitted to the votersfor renewal.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  East Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  3 SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASK VOTERS FOR FUNDINGAID  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Also ran in EX4/1  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Our income is way, way below the income of other elementary schooldistricts in Santa Clara County, and we have made very significant reductionsin our operating budget,&quot; said James Hastings, assistant superintendent ofadministrative services, in explaining the need for Measure C.;    Also on theballot are bond measures from two other San Jose school districts to raisemoney to fix aging schools and build new classrooms. Measure B is beingsubmitted by Alum Rock Union Elementary School District, and Measure A by EastSide Union High School District.;    Unlike the Oak Grove measure, these twomeasures would not raise taxes, but would rather extend each district'scurrent bond tax rate.;    All three measures will require a two-thirds voteto pass. None of the measures has drawn any organized opposition, districtofficials said.;    It is difficult to predict what will happen on electionday, district officials said, because they have done no formal polling duringthe campaign. However, each district did commission its own survey beforestarting its campaign.;    Judging from the results, the outcome could beclose for Oak Grove. Its survey showed support for a $68 parcel tax to be 60percent to 70 percent.;    &quot;We're definitely holding our breath and workinghard,&quot; Hastings said.;    In East Side Union, a hefty 85 percent of voterssurveyed said they would support a bond measure such as the one the districtis submitting, which maintains existing taxes.;    Exact results from AlumRock's survey were not available, but campaign consultant Carol Beddo said thesurvey did show a two-thirds vote could be achieved -- if people understoodMeasure B would not raise taxes and that, like Oak Grove, Alum Rock is one ofthe county's poorest districts.;    Of Santa Clara County elementary schooldistricts, Oak Grove ranks as the third poorest, and Alum Rock as the fifthpoorest.;    If passed, money from Oak Grove's parcel tax would go into thedistrict's operating budget. It would be used for instructional supplies,services for remedial students, building maintenance, energy conservation --and to restore services that have been cut.;    For the past four years, statefunds for education have not been keeping pace with inflation, and thedistrict has had to cut more than $3 million from its budget, Hastings said.Next year, Oak Grove is projecting another $1.2 million in cuts, or about 2percent of its current budget.;    Alum Rock's Measure B bond measure wouldraise $47 million for the district by extending the district's current taxrate. Most of that money would go to fix the district's aging schools.;   Carpets and locks would be replaced; wiring, plumbing and lighting fixturesredone; bathrooms remodeled; more storage for teachers and handicap accessadded, said Deputy Superintendent Keith Cakebread.;    Of the district's 25schools, 19 are reaching or have already passed 30 years of age. At41-year-old Linda Vista School on Kirk Avenue, many classrooms have only twoelectrical outlets. With the computers, televisions and other gadgetryproliferating in today's classrooms, circuits get overloaded easily and extraextension cords pose a safety hazard, Cakebread said.;    Cakebread alsopointed out a bathroom at Linda Vista where the drain is corroded and severaltiles are chipped or cracked. Down the hall was a classroom with two storagecabinets, each about the size of a hallway closet. Overflow supplies werebeing stored in stacks of brightly colored boxes against one wall.;    EastSide's Measure A bond measure would raise $108 million for the district byextending the district's current tax rate. East Side would also use its fundsto fix deteriorating schools, and to build additional classrooms and a newhigh school. The high school district is expecting the number of students torise by 3,000 during the next nine years, or a 14 percent growth.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MAYA SURYARAMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  735  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058143,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
