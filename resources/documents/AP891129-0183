Its investigative agency, the General Accounting Office, saidproblems exist in every major federal department and agency. TheGAO said the shoddy government oversight of how its money is spentis years' old in some cases and blamed Reagan administrationderegulation and staff cutbacks for much of the problem.   The GAO also said that an ongoing audit of the Air Force hadfound its financial statements ``dead wrong ... in practicallyevery area'' and cautioned that conditions likely were worse in theArmy and Navy because the Air Force is believed to have superiorrecords.   ``There is a seemingly never-ending and costly trail ofmismanagement, abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs,''the GAO said in the report to the Senate Government AffairsCommittee. ``Most of the problems are known, and in many instanceshave been known for years, but they remain uncorrected.''   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who heads the GAO, said thegovernment has wasted hundreds of millions of millions of dollarson systems designed to improve accounting that proved virtuallyuseless.   What's more, he said, many identified problems remainuncorrected because government managers charged in a 1982 law withidentifying flaws treat them ``just as a paperwork exercise.''   He said the government needed to make a major investment instate-of-the-art accounting and financial-management systems butsaid he did not know how much that would cost.   He recommended the appointment of a government-wide ``chieffinancial officer'' to oversee government spending, with deputiesat each major agency who would be required to file detailed monthlyand annual financial reports.   The chairman of the committee, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said hewould press for passage of legislation creating those posts whenCongress returns next year. ``This (government) being one of thebiggest businesses in the world, we've just got to do it,'' Glennsaid.   Bowsher said the multibillion dollar scandals involving thesavings and loan industry, the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment and the Energy Department's troubled nuclear plantswere likely to be followed by billions more in fraud, waste andabuse for a common reason: lousy management.   ``We have every major agency in the federal governmentacknowledging that they have weak financial management sytstems,''Bowsher said, adding that the government was ``bound to end up withscandals and fraud and mismanagement.''   Bowsher said the Office of Managment and Budget, a White Houseagency, recently had improved its efforts to identify problemsareas. He said the GAO too was launching a government-wide reviewto identify the potential for costly waste and abuse.   He said the Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service;NASA; the Medicare system; the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., thegovernment insurer of private pension systems, and student loanprograms already had been placed on GAO's priority watch list.   Likely to be added, he said, were a host of governmentinsurance, credit and financing programs, including the ExportImport Bank, the Farmers Home Administration, foreign militarysales accounts and the new agency set up to bail out failing Sandamp;Ls.   He said $150 billion ``was not unrealistic'' as an estimate ofwaste and fraud likely to occur in the near future, a figure thatdid not include the two-year Air Force audit, which Bowsher saidhad not reached the point at which he could put a price tag on theproblem.   That report is due in January and the GAO plans a follow-upaudit before moving on to the Army and Navy, Bowsher said.   Bowsher said Reagan-era deregulation and staff reductions weremade at a time the government ``had no plan to achieve the cutbacksand not lessen our oversight and control. ... We have been pennywise and really pound foolish.''   Complicating poor oversight and accounting has been the rapidturnover among senior agency political appointees and thereluctance of Cabinet members to tackle complicated managementproblems, he said.   ``The great turnover of the presidential appointees is a greatproblem for our government,'' he said.   Congress also has contributed to the problem by placing certainprograms _ including the savings and loan bailout _ ``off budget''to keep their costs from affecting the federal deficit.   ``We see a trend here of going `off budget' but not for a momentreducing the risk to the American taxpayer,'' he said. ``The hollowgovernment is really happening and I'm afraid it's going to getmore hollow because of the budget deficit.''   Bowsher delivered to the Senate a GAO report on compliance withthe 1982 Financial Integrity Act, which required agency managers toreport annually on potential weaknesses in government management.Half of those managers have not been trained to prepare therequired reports, the GAO found.</TEXT></DOC>
