A dissident called thepro-democracy movement ``unstoppable.''   The rally Friday began as a memorial service at the city'sVysehrad Cathedral for a student killed by the Nazis 50 years ago.   Reporters said tens of thousands of people were at the rally.The state news agency CTK estimated the crowd at 15,000.   Five hours later, riot police attacked the demonstrators as theytried to march from the memorial service to downtown WenceslasSquare. Witnesses said police used tear gas and filled more thanthree buses with those arrested.   At least 13 people were reported admitted to one Prague hospitalwith concussions, and others were brought to at least two otherhospitals, where officials were ordered to withhold further details.   As the demonstrators marched, they chanted slogans criticizinghard-line Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. ``Dinosaurs, resign!''they shouted. ``We want freedom and free elections! Communists getout! End to one-party rule!''   It was the largest public protest since August 1969, when crowdsgathered in downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasionsmashed the reformist ``Prague spring'' led by Alexander Dubcek,then Communist Party leader.   Karel Srp, leader of the dissident Jazz Section, called therally the ``biggest and best demonstration I have ever seen, betterthan in 1969 because the atmosphere is much better. We know that wecan win. This is unstoppable.''   The memorial was organized by the official students'organization in honor of Czech student Jan Opletal, killed duringan uprising 50 years ago against the Nazi occupation.   Michael Schwarz, a staff photographer of The Atlanta Journal andThe Atlanta Constitution, said he went with the crowd trying tomarch to downtown Wenceslas Square but was beaten on the head bypolice and chased away.   ``Many people were bleeding,'' said Schwarz, who saw about 12ambulances taking people to hospitals. He also said he saw at leastthree busloads of people being taken away by police. Rude Pravo,the Communist Party daily, said about 100 people were taken topolice stations.   Schwarz said police seized his camera and chased him away.   Paula Butturini, a Warsaw-based correspondent of the ChicagoTribune, required 15 stitches on her head, the paper said inChicago. She was treated at Prague's Na Frantisku hospital and thenreleased.   Martin Klima, an independent student who addressed the rally,declared: ``Oppression is worse than death! We should not onlyremember the past with piety, we must care for the present and evenmore for the future!''   ``We must fight for freedom because you cannot live withoutit,'' Klima said.   Speakers representing the official student organizations urged``constructive cooperation'' and were booed when they said thepeople should ``rectify past mistakes.''   Almost in unison, the crowd called out the question, ``Who is toblame'' for the mistakes?   When the crowd started moving toward the cathedral and itscemetery, where the laying of flowers and candles was scheduled,many students began shouting slogans against Jakes and others ofthe aging leadership.   ``You have lost already!'' the crowd yelled.   State TV said some of the participants ``misused the massgathering for anti-socialist performances.''   Some students at the rally shouted ``Masaryk!'' for TomasGarrigue Masaryk, who was Czechoslovakia's first president and iscredited with founding the country after the Austro-HungarianEmpire collapsed in World War I.   They also chanted the name of Jan Palach, a student who burnedhimself to death to protest the Soviet-led invasion.   On Wednesday, police permitted a demonstration by 1,000environmentalists in downtown Prague but prevented 300-500 peoplefrom marching to government headquarters.   Czechoslovakia's hard-line leaders, who were installed after the1968 invasion, have generally resisted the kinds of reforms adoptedin neighboring Communist nations. Earlier this week, they announcedthat travel restrictions would be eased to allow people freermovement to the West.</TEXT></DOC>
