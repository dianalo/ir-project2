A new proposal from Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee andthree activist House members has increased pressure oncongressional leaders to continue the fight for such taxrelief. They vowed to do so after they successfully pushedthe issue against Republicans in last fall's budget summit.The latest proposal, among other things, would create a new35% top income-tax rate and impose an 11% surtax on therichest taxpayers to give more generous tax credits toworking parents.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is Round Two of the battle we had last October,&quot;said Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), a co-sponsor with Reps.Thomas Downey of New York and George Miller of California.&quot;We said then that the Democrats would be back.&quot;   Since last fall, Democratic leaders have been distractedby the war in the Persian Gulf, cowed by President Bush'shigh poll ratings and stymied by their own internal divisionsover tax policy. But the initiative from the rank-and-filemembers was well-received by Sen. George Mitchell of Maineand Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Senate and Housemajority leaders, who have been working separately on asimilar tax package. &quot;I'm for it as soon as possible,&quot; Sen.Mitchell said, speaking of tax relief generally.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of thetax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said he would work withsenators to cut taxes for middle-income Americans. But, headded: &quot;As long as the president opposes an increase inincome-tax rates on the wealthiest Americans . . . it will bevery difficult to enact something like this.&quot;   The same argument about the president's opposition wasmade by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman DanRostenkowski (D., Ill.), who as the House's chief tax-writerhas been most reluctant to reopen the debate. Moreover, hesaid, many Democrats would be loath to support a tax proposalfor fear of reviving the &quot;tax-and-spend&quot; label.   &quot;Do they want to accomplish something, or do they justwant to talk about it?,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski asked, referringto Sen. Mitchell and Rep. Gephardt. &quot;I don't want to be in aposition of just making political statements.&quot;   Sen. Gore, a possible presidential contender, and hisHouse allies said their plan would give some tax relief to 35million families, and remove two million poor families fromtax rolls. With the tax increases on top-income taxpayers,the proposal wouldn't add to the deficit, they assert.   It would give all taxpayers an $800 tax credit for eachchild, indexed to rise with inflation, in place of thecurrent personal exemptions for dependents; the exemption, bycontrast, would be worth about $345 for taxpayers in thelowest 15% tax bracket in 1992. The proposal also wouldincrease the earned-income tax credit, a refundable creditfor low-income working parents, to account for largerfamilies.   To pay for the proposed tax breaks, the sponsors wouldincrease taxes on six million families who rank in the top10% in terms of income. The new 35% top marginal rate wouldapply to families with taxable incomes above $110,000 a year,according to a summary. The 11% surtax would be imposed onthose with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 a year. Inaddition, the alternative minimum tax, which is assessedagainst those who benefit most from tax breaks, would rise to29% from 24%.   But richer taxpayers would receive some breaks as well.The package would repeal last year's limit on itemizeddeductions and restore personal exemptions for upper-incomepeople. That would allow taxpayers to fully deduct charitablecontributions and state and local taxes, a change that isespecially important to lawmakers such as Reps. Downey andMiller, who represent high-tax states.</TEXT></DOC>
