(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart says hisscandal-rocked ministry has been saved by supporters who answeredhis plea for donations to keep his television programs on the air.   On Feb. 12, Swaggart said that his daily and weekly TV showswould go off the air on Feb. 26 unless he received hefty donations.During his program last Sunday, Swaggart said the ministry had lost$1.5 million in January.   During Wednesday night services at his Baton Rouge church,Swaggart said a telethon to raise funds had been successful.   ``If there are any newsmen out there _ and I know that there are_ I want to announce that the telecast will go on the air Sunday,continuing to tell the world that Jesus Christ is coming,'' he said.   Swaggart confessed to an unspecified sin before his congregationlast year, and that was followed by a New Orleans prostitute's claimthat she had sexual affairs with the evangelist. He was laterdefrocked by the Assemblies of God denomination.   Swaggart also commented Wednesday on a full-page advertisement inthe Feb. 20 issue of Time magazine, purchased by Planned Parenthood.Half of the page is covered by a photograph of Swaggart when heconfessed before his congregation.   The ad asks readers to join Planned Parenthood's Campaign to KeepAbortion Safe and Legal.   ``America has always been blessed with characters who claim tohave all the answers,'' the ad says. ``The problem is, they don'talways practice what they preach. And hypocrisy can be extremelyharmful.''   Swaggart said his son Donnie told him the organization had``directed a $2 million campaign against us.'' He said theadvertisement cost $250,000.   ``They've got $1,750,000 left, and I'm going to get that,''Swaggart said.   William Treeby, an attorney for Swaggart, said the remark wasmade in jest and Swaggart had no intention of filing suit over thead.   In January, Penthouse magazine published a story that quoted NewOrleans stripper Catherine Mary Kampen as saying she had an affairwith Swaggart. Swaggart has threatened to sue the magazine.   Kampen has been arrested in New Orleans on allegations ofshoplifting a $40 dress from a department store nearly a year ago.   Detectives said Wednesday that Kampen, 38, was booked with theftwhen she surrendered Tuesday and later was released on bond. Policesaid a guard saw her photo in a newspaper Jan. 31 and recognized heras the woman who stole the dress.</TEXT></DOC>
