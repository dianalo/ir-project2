Ron Brown said that when Jackson broke off the negotiationsWednesday, the platform was ``close to completed. We had dealt withmost of the issues.''   If the talks resume, Brown said in an interview in Atlanta,``we'd be close to signing off on it.''   In Washington, sources on the Platform Committee said theDukakis and Jackson campaigns had been seeking a compromise on theMiddle East that would speak of human rights for all under the CampDavid Accords, and make a specific reference to the Palestinians.   Dukakis platform representatives rejected out of hand last monthin Denver Jackson's call for self-determination for thePalestinians.   The sources, who asked not to be identified, said it was likelythat the Dukakis forces would accept a Jackson minority plank onchild care and family issues, while voting down Jackson's call forhigher taxes and a military freeze.   Jackson has reserved the right to take as many as 13 issues tothe floor for votes Tuesday when the convention takes up theplatform.   But his negotiators said from the outset it was unlikely theywould pursue them all.   Brown said that most of the work that remains to be done on theplatform deals with the format and how it will be presented to theconvention.   Brown said he is in touch with Susan Estrich and Paul Brountas,Dukakis' campaign manager and chairman, but they were discussingthe larger questions of Jackson's role in the fall campaign, notthe specific platform and convention matters.   Michael Barnes and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the chief platformnegotiators for the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns respectively,left Washington Friday for Atlanta.   Four years ago in San Francisco, the Democrats rebuffed Jacksonby lopsided votes on three minority planks _ a call for a policy of``no first use'' of nuclear weapons, ``substantial'' cuts indefense spending, and elimination of runoff primaries _ whileaccepting a compromise Jackson proposal on affirmative action. Thatconvention also adopted Gary Hart's call for limits on use of U.S.military forces overseas.   Jackson has nearly 1,150 delegates going to the Atlantaconvention, three times as many as he had in San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
