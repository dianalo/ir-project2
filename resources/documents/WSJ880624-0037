Drought fears drove soybean futures prices sharply higher in early trading, as the July contract at one point rose to its 45-cent daily limit. But midday forecasts for rainfall across portions of the Midwest today and tomorrow turned the rally into a rout as soybean contracts closed with hefty losses.    Profit-taking by traders locking in their gains added momentum to the price reversal, analysts said.    Corn futures prices followed a similar route, although prices ended mixed since the underlying crop is in imminent danger from the drought as it nears its crucial tasseling phase.    As soybean and grain futures prices traced vertiginous paths on the Chicago Board of Trade, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng met with farm state governors at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport to express concern and counter increasing drought hysteria.    Mr. Lyng, in an unintentional pun, told the governors that the drought &quot;situation is still somewhat fluid.&quot; He said that rainfall over the next two weeks could lead to significant improvements in estimated crop yields across much of the Midwest.    Charles Notis, a weather forecaster with Freese-Notis Weather in Des Moines, Iowa, was one of several private forecasters whose 24-hour to 48-hour forecast included increased chances for rain in eastern portions of the Grain Belt.    &quot;The jet stream is dipping a bit into the Great Lakes region&quot; and bringing moisture with it, Mr. Notis said. He predicted that one-fourth of an inch to a half-inch of rain could fall across portions of eastern Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, northern Illinois, northern Indiana and on into Ohio by noon tomorrow.    &quot;But longer-term, the drought is still intact&quot; and the withering, hot weather is far from over, he warned. Even with overcast skies, &quot;it could still hit 100 degrees in Des Moines&quot; today, he said.    Despite the increased likelihood of rain in the next few days, some analysts continued to cut crop estimates. Some estimates of soybean yields, already reduced by 10% from last year, were slashed another 10% to about 27 bushels an acre compared with 33 bushels an acre in 1987.    Adding downward pressure on soybean futures prices in Chicago was weakness in the European cash market for soybean meal, said Jerry Gidel, a futures analyst with G.H. Miller andamp; Co. in Chicago. He said a lot of Chicago futures traders have been tracking European soybean meal prices as a &quot;signal&quot; for which way the Chicago market is headed.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   SUGAR: Futures prices declined, as soybeans continued as a major influence. October delivery sugar fell 0.20 cent a pound to 10.78 cents. An analyst noted that as soybeans declined, so did sugar because soybean traders who also trade in sugar were selling in both markets. &quot;This goes to show that a lot of the recent strength in sugar can be attributed more to the soybean market than sugar factors, although sugar has price-supporting fundamentals of its own that traders have tended to overlook in their focus on soybeans,&quot; he said. One potential bullish rumor yesterday was that Mexico has asked permission from customers to postpone shipments of sugar from the fourth quarter of this year to the first quarter of 1989. No reason was given for the reported request for postponement, analysts and trade sources said, although at least one dealer noted that physical supplies of sugar in the world market are relatively tight. However, another dealer noted he had no evidence that Mexico actually had contacted its customers to ask for postponements. &quot;As far as I know at the moment, it's strictly a rumor, without verification,&quot; he said. There also was a rumor that Brazil's northern sugar harvest was running about a month behind, but no details or confirmation were available.    COTTON: Futures prices fell as much as their daily permissible limit, as forecasts of rain in soybean-growing areas prompted selling of cotton contracts. October and December contracts, which fell their permissible limits, settled at 65.80 cents a pound and 64.81 cents, respectively. Other 1988-89 delivery months were down from 0.45 cent to 1.90 cents. According to one analyst, yesterday's action simply extended the market's recent pattern. &quot;There has been an overly intensive concentration on the possibility that cotton-growing areas will experience the same weather as soybean areas, and prices have fluctuated along with the forecasts, up on drought and down on the possibilities of rain,&quot; he said. However, James Roemer, meteorologist for Weather Trades Inc. of Des Moines, said: &quot;There's a battle going on among meteorologists about weather in the Mississippi Delta.&quot; The National Weather Service forecasts have been wrong for the past week or more, Mr. Roemer said. &quot;We see the dry weather in the Delta, and now in southern Texas, continuing the rest of this month and possibly into July.&quot; He said the southern part of Mississippi and southern Louisiana have had up to one inch of scattered rains, &quot;but 75% to 80% of the Delta has remained dry and it looks like it's going to stay that way. Dry weather is also affecting the Texas cotton crop from Abilene down into Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande area. I know we disagree with other weather people, but that's what we see.&quot;    COFFEE: Futures prices declined. There weren't any new developments and the weather continued to be mild in Brazil's coffee-growing areas. September delivery coffee eased 2.96 cents a pound to $1.3452, ending near the lows of the day. According to Joel Burgio, meteorologist for Weather Services Corp., of Bedford, Mass., Brazil's coffee regions have been relatively warm over the past week to 10 days and the forecast calls for similar conditions through the end of this week. A high pressure area will move into Argentina from the Pacific Ocean today and tomorrow, Mr. Burgio said, and then sweep across lower Brazil and Uruguay. &quot;Temperatures in Parana, the most southern coffee growing area in Brazil, will range from about 45 degrees to 50 degrees and in the more important, more northern coffee areas, such as Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, they will be mostly in the 50s,&quot; Mr. Burgio said. </TEXT></DOC>
