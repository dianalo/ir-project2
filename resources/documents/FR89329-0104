DPR-24 andDPR-27, issued to the Wisconsin Electric Power Company for operation ofthe Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in ManitowocCounty, Wisconsin.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications(TS) relating to the design and operation of the Point Beach fuel cyclewith upgraded core features and at higher core power peaking factors (F<T2>Q</T2> and F<T2>H</T2>) than are currently permitted by the plant TS.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated August 26, 1988, as supplemented by letters dated October28, November 30, and December 23, 1988; and as modified January 17, 1988(sic).The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed change to the TS is required in order to permit the licenseeto incorporate higher core power peaking factors which will allow the useof a low-low leakage loading pattern (L4P) fuel management strategy andwill result in decreased neutron fluence to the reactor vessel. This fluencereduction will help address reactor vessel irradiation damage issues suchas pressurized thermal shock, low upper shelf material toughness and pressure-temperaturerestrictions on heatup and cooldown. The higher core power peaking factorswill allow additional fluence reduction measures, such as the use of peripheralpower suppression assemblies, to be pursued.In addition to the increase in core power peaking factors, the proposedchanges would permit the use of an upgraded fuel product features package.The upgraded fuel product features include: removable top nozzles, integralfuel burnable absorbers, axial blankets, extended burnup geometry, andinclusion of a debris filter bottom nozzle. Finally, the reanalysis forthis proposed amendment supports the removal of the fuel assembly thimbleplugging devices and the elimination of the third segment of the K(z) curve.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and concludes that operation of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant with thehigher core power peaking factors and with the upgraded fuel features isacceptable. The evaluation demonstrates that acceptable thermal limitsare not exceeded with the proposed changes. Normal operations as well asthe accidents and transients which required reevaluation remain withinacceptable bounds. Use of the upgraded fuel features does not involve signficantmodifications to the Point Beach reactor cores. Neither the nuclear physicsnor the thermal-hydraulic parameters are significantly affected by thetransition to the upgraded fuel features. Finally, sufficient conservatismhas been demonstrated to permit the removal of the thimble plugging devicesand the elimination of the third segment of the K(z) curve without compromisingsafety.The environmental impacts of operating the Point Beach Nuclear Plant inthe proposed manner are within the bounds of those impacts previously evaluatedin the Final Environmental Statement with the exception of the Steam GeneratorTube Rupture (SGTR) Accident. The SGTR accident was reevaluated to reflectan update to the safety injection termination requirements used in thecurrent Point Beach SGTR recovery procedures. Although slightly higherbecause of higher calculated primary-to-secondary leakage during the transient,the doses calculated for the reevaluation of the SGTR accident remain a``small fraction'' of the 10 CFR Part 100 exposure guidelines. The amendmentdoes not otherwise affect radiological plant effluents during normal operationsand occupational radiation exposure is unaffected. Accordingly, the Commissionconcludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiologicalenvironmental impact.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 6, 1989 (54 FR 5707). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS will in no way affect environs located outside the restricted areaas defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological planteffluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the Point Beach Nuclear PlantUnit Nos. 1 and 2, dated May 1972.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of no Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated August 26, 1988 as supplemented by letters dated October28, November 30, and December 23, 1988; and as modified January 17, 1988(sic), which are available for public inspection at the Commission's PublicDocument Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the Joseph P.
