The move came after an Afghan government official said Mondaythe three-week guerrilla attack around Jalalabad was collapsing andthe rest of the country was quiet.   ``There has been terrible coordination in Jalalabad,''acknowledged a guerrilla source today, speaking on condition ofanonomity.   He said the guerrillas' strength lies in harassment, notlaunching a conventional attack on an urban center. To return theJalalabad fight to a hit-and-run battle, he said ``would be abetter strategy.''   Western diplomats, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,today reported a lull in battle for control of Jalalabad. Aguerrilla victory would give the insurgents control of their firstmajor city and provide a base for the interim government theyelected Feb. 23 in Pakistan.   The diplomats said the fighting had dropped off because theU.S.-backed insurgents are trying to coordinate their militarystrategy.   However, the insurgents are also moving more supplies toward thebattlefront and trying to negotiate the surrender of governmenttroops, diplomats said.   Casualty reports in the fight for Jalalabad have varied widely.Official government sources put the guerrilla death count at morethan 4,000. Guerrillas and Western sources said about 300insurgents have died and another 900 have been injured.   Mohammad Nabi Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman in theAfghan capital of Kabul, said 190 guerrillas were killed betweenSunday night and Monday night. He said two government soldiers andthree civilians also died.   Amani said guerrillas fired 250 rockets and shells at Jalalabadduring that time, compared with 12,000 in the previous 24 hours.   ``We're of the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion thatthey cannot achieve any success through military means,'' he saidof the guerrillas.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldierswere killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting aroundJalalabad.   The guerrillas launched their offensive on Jalalabad March 6. Atits peak the fighting, was said to be the heaviest in thedecade-long war.   The insurgents have been fighting the Afghan government since1978. The Soviet Union, which sent troops into Afghanistan inDecember 1979 to support the Moscow-allied government, withdrew thelast of its soldiers Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
