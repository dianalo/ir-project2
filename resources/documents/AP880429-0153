The protest came after underground leaders of the Arab uprisingcalled for marches and symbolic funerals on Friday, the Moslemsabbath, to honor 175 Palestinians killed in five months of unrestin the occupied territories.   In a new underground leaflet, Palestinian leaders called formore commercial strikes and protests against the Israelioccupation. But the West Bank and Gaza Strip remained mostly quieton the Sabbath, the second during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.   In southern Lebanon, two militiamen from the Israeli-backedSouth Lebanon Army were killed when their vehicle ran over a landmine on a side road in Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,''which stretches from six to 10 miles north of the border, the armycommand said.   Israel radio said troops entered the villages of Kfar Hamam andRachaiya El Foukhar, respectively four and six miles north of theIsraeli border, to interrogate dozens of residents about twoguerrilla infiltrations into Israel Tuesday and Wednesday.   Two Israeli soldiers and five Palestinian guerrillas were killedin clashes following the infiltrations.   Security sources in Lebanon said the troops, aided by theirLebanese militia allies, focused the searches on the rocky terraineast of where the guerrillas infiltrated.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they weretold five Lebanese villagers had been detained. The militarycommand would not comment on the report.   Military officials have linked the recent guerrilla raids to the5-month-old uprising in the occupied lands and said they expectmore raids aimed at supporting the protesters.   In Jerusalem, several hundred Moslem worshipers emerged fromnoon prayers on the sacred Temple Mount waving outlawed Palestinianflags and chanting: ``Jews leave! The prophet Mohammed's army iscoming.'' A police helicopter hovered above.   Another chant glorified Khalil Wazir, the PLO military leaderwho was gunned down April 16 in Tunis. Israeli sources haveimplicated Israel in the killing but the government has refusedcomment.   Military police, who were stationed on nearby rooftops, did notintervene and the protest dispersed peacefully.   Inside the Al Aqsa mosque, a Moslem prayer leader called onArabs to ``attack the enemies, attack the non-believers.''   ``More martyrs for God and the homeland!'' Sheikh Mohammed Siamtold about 7,000 worshipers. ``Our only weapon is Islam. Millionsof eyes are watching us.''   In the walled Old City in Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinianshopkeepers opened their stores promptly at 2 p.m., the hour thatunderground PLO leaders have instructed shops to open duringRamadan.   Israeli police, trying to thwart the PLO instructions, havetried forcing Arab merchants to open all day or preventing themfrom opening at all. Fourteen shopowners are awaiting trial forviolating army orders to open. They could receive two-year jailterms.   In the Gaza Strip, small disturbances were reported followingnoon prayers in several areas. Initial reports said there were noinjuries.   The latest underground leaflet, signed as usual by the ``UnitedNational Leadership of the Uprising,'' called on Arabs to practicecivil disobedience and form self-governing bodies to replaceIsraeli-appointed Arab officials.   ``The road to civil disobedience lies through the formation ofmore local committees,'' the leaflet said. It called onPalestinians to strike ``the severest blows'' at Arab officialsviewed as collaborators with Israel.   The leaflet also called for more commercial strikes, days oftribute to victims of the uprising and ``days of Palestiniananger.''   This week's relative calm in the territories led Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir to proclaim that the ``intefadah'' _ Arabic foruprising _ was fading.   But an unidentified defense official was quoted in the dailyJerusalem Post Friday as saying the army did not expect theuprising to die out soon.   ``Despite the enormous pressures we have been putting on theinhabitants of the territories, despite the unprecedented massarrests and despite the death toll ... the inhabitants still feelthe uprising is on,'' the official was quoted as saying.   ``And what matters more than anything else is their own feelingsabout it.''</TEXT></DOC>
