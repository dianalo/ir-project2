Half the animals were subsequently exposed to cigarettesmoke. Animals were sacrificed at 1 day, 7 days, and 1 month after exposure.Lungs were lavaged and macrophages separated from the lavage fluid. Lungfiber concentration, numbers of fibers in macrophages, and fiber sizesfrom tissue (TFs), macrophages (MFs), and macrophage-free lavagate (FFs)were determined by electron microscopy. Smoke-exposed animals retainedgreater numbers of fibers in lung tissue by 1 month but had greater totalnumbers of fibers in macrophages at all time periods. In both smokersand nonsmokers, fibers in the three morphologic compartments had distinctlydifferent lengths: the longest fibers were found associated with thelung tissue; the macrophages always contained the shortest fibers; andthe macrophage-free lavagate had fibers of intermediate size. However,fiber widths and aspect ratios did not show the same clear separationby anatomic compartment, suggesting that in both smoking and nonsmokinganimals length is the size parameter which is most important in determiningfiber clearance. Smoking did not affect the lengths of MFs but did producea progressive reduction in the lengths of FFs and TFs with time. Thesedata indicate that smoking causes a marked increase in the number offibers retained in the lung within macrophages and suggest that eithermacrophage removal via the mucociliary escalator or macrophage mobilityis impaired by cigarette smoke. However, smoking does not change thesizes of fibers in macrophages and does not appear to depress phagocyticcapacity.</TEXT></DOC>
