 However, computers must be monitored by humantranslators since their average success rate is only 70 to 80percent.andP;  Although artificial intelligence has long been seen asideal for translation work, Japan is far ahead of both the US andEurope in language-translation research.andP;  The US has only fourmajor players in the market for machine translation products andservices.andP;  European researchers involved in the Eurotra project,funded by the EEC, are designing a multilingual system to handlethe nine major EEC languages.andP;  In Japan, however, prototypesystems are capable of translating 20,000 to 60,000 words perhour, and Japanese researchers are already at work on a systemthat will automatically translate communications signals.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Language TranslationResearch and DevelopmentForeign CompetitionArtificial IntelligenceAutomation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lost In The TranslationandM;Bach in the early days of AI, when researchers tried to make machines doalmost everything people could do (just short of making breakfast in bed),using computers to translate information from one language to another washigh on everybody's priority list.andP;  But, as legend has it, someone triedtranslating &quot;The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak&quot; into Russian.andP;  Asthe story goes, the end result produced a somewhat idiosyncratic phrase: &quot;Thevodka is strong, but the meat is spoiled.&quot;andP;  Evidently this translation bummedeverybody out so bad that they gave up on machine translation.andM;Such is the stuff of myth, except for the result: the U.S.andP;  has the weakestlanguage-translation effort underway of all the high-tech countries.andP;  Mayberesearchers did get bummed out by the poor Russian translation, or maybe theywere just bummed that somebody would spread such a trite story.andP;  Mature adultacademicians have killed themselves for less.andM;Machine translation is the use of a computer to translate text from onelanguage to another.andP;  This technology falls primarily in the category ofnatural language because it uses grammar and adapts grammatical structuresamong different languages.andP;  Most translation work is done by individualtranslators and is very time-consuming; even the most skilled need up to anhour to translate 100-500 words.andM;In contrast, computers can translate 1,000-10,000 words an hour, 24 hours aday, using a standard format that prevents inconsistencies.andP;  At an averagesuccess rate of 70%-80%, these machine translations still require monitoringby human translators.andP;  The story about the computer translating the Englishphrase into the garbled Russian one may seem somewhat hackneyed (unless itwas your system that produced that translation), but such a translation canhave extreme side effects when the machine determines whether &quot;Bugs in thesystem; service immediately&quot; requires a call to a software programmer or to apest-control agency.andM;The U.S.andP;  and Japan are the two largest developers of machine-translationproducts and services; Europe has the largest research effort in a projectcalled Eurotra.andP;  The Japanese, who have projects scattered through many (ifnot most) of their larger corporations, are developing programs to translatekanji, the Japanese symbol language, into English.andP;  The U.S.andP;  is making alimited effort in machine translation consisting of four companies: Logos,Automated Language Processing Systems (ALPS), Systran, and SmartCommunications.andP;  A fifth organization, WCC (for Weidner or WorldwideCommunications Corp.), was shut down in September 1988 by primary investorBravice International.andM;Thus, four U.S.andP;  players compete in a market the Japanese are spendingmillions of dollars on annually.andP;  Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, NEC, and Sharp havecommercial products under development, and Fujitsu's is already available inJapan.andP;  It is expected that IBM will attempt to enter this arena in 1990.andP;  Ifyou ask me, this market is ripe for startups.andM;During the summer of 1989, Fujitsu previewed a prototype of amachine-translation system called SCANFILE, an online database translatorthat allows users to tap into technical databases in Japan.andP;  Users can inputEnglish commands and retrieve translated information in about 80 seconds.andO;Fujitsu has already demonstrated a German version, and the company claimsthat SCANFILE is the world's first online translator.andP;  The product requiresno knowledge of Japanese and combines intelligent text retrieval withtranslation to perform its operations.andM;After scanning the database (using keyword search methods), the systemtranslates the retrieved data into English and forwards it to the user.andO;SCANFILE runs through a Fujitsu computer system called the Facom InformationProcessing system.andP;  One of the prime beneficiaries of the product will beFujitsu itself, which employs 4,500 people in North America.andM;Europe has a few machine translation programs; the most notable is Eurotra.andO;Funded by the EFC (but not under ESPRIT), its goal is to develop amultilingual system that can translate between any two Common Marketcountries.andP;  Initiated in 1985, the system is designed to handle the nineprimary EEC languages (or a total of 72 translation pairs).andP;  Twelve countriesand close to 100 researchers are involed in Eurotra, which is administeredfrom Luxemburg.andP;  Plans are for a working prototype by the early 1990s.andM;Most companies interested in machine translation have a high degree of papertraffic international markets.andP;  An obvious example is Xerox, which usesmachine translation for almost 50,000 documents a year.andP;  Xerox justintroduced a desktop application in conjunction with Systran, which allowsfor translation complete with graphics: charts and tables don't have to beremade after the translation system is finished.andP;  Xerox claims that the$3,500 system can translate up to 2 million words per CPU hour, with 95%accuracy.andP;  (I'd have to see it to believe it.)andM;Other companies such as NEC, IBM, UNISYS, and Nixdorf use machine translationbecause of the sheer size of their operations, both internally andexternally.andP;  Services from each of the developers usually range from$3,000-$5,000 per month, partly due to the supervision of the machine's finaloutput by human translators.andM;The machine-translation companies are relatively small despite the worldwideneed for translation services.andP;  Logos was founded in 1969 by Bernard E. Scottto provide automated translation from English-Vietnamese for use by the U.S.andO;government (initial contracts called for wartime translation of manuals andtexts).andP;  Since the mid-1970s, Logos has concentrated on the Europe market,where it is one of the strongest machine-translation companies around.andP;  Logosreceived venture-capital funding in 1981 and developed its primary product, aGerman-to-English and English-to-German software system.andP;  The companygenerates about $5 million annually (on par with ALPS and Systran), which hasremained essentially unchanged in the last five years.andP;  It has also absorbedmore than $35 million in venture capital from BMW (an investor in Gold Hill)and Drexel Burnham.andM;WCC, known in its final days as Worldwide Communications Corp., offered aproduct line consisting of two products (Micro and Macro-Cat) and atranslation service bureau that translated for clients in all majorlanguages.andP;  ALPS, which is publicly held and one of the only AI companies inUtah, has also had a somewhat static revenue growth in recent years.andP;  SmartCommunications, the only company based in New York, was founded by John Smartin 1973.andP;  Systran, one of the oldest machine-translation vendors, is a U.S.andO;subsidiary of the French firm Gachot S.A.andP;  (whose primary business isindustrial valve manufacturing).andP;  It has eaten up $30 million in funding, yetmaintains an annual revenue stream of approximately $3 million.andM;I think the origins of machine translation have produced some of the beststories of any emerging technology.andP;  The roots of U.S.andP;  machine-translationcompanies party derive from government efforts during the Vietnam War (suchas Logos).andP;  The National Science Foundation and the U.S.andP;  Air Force undertooka massive translation effort in the early 1960s in an attempt to translatehuge amounts of Russian and Vietnamese text, especially in manuals andjournals.andP;  However, after millions of dollars had been spent with fewresults, the NSF pulled out in 1966.andM;Weidner Communications and ALPS were formed as a spinoff of the Brigham YoungUniversity machine-translation project in 1977.andP;  The project was part of anundertaking by the Mormons to translate the Book of Mormon into thousands offoreign languages for missionary purposes.andP;  The project gradually came to astandstill, and two commercial organizations resulted: Wiedner and ALPS.andO;ALPS maintained close ties to the project, but Weidner set up itsheadquarters in the Midwest.andP;  Both companies maintained facilities in Utah,though, due to their involvement in the project.andM;The Japanese have been far more aggressive in provoking machine-translationdevelopment than Americans.andP;  Japanese companies have shown prototype systemssupposedly capable of translating Japanese to English at 20,000-60,000 wordsper hour, but incredible translation speeds produce less accurate text thatrequires more modification from human translators.andP;  The Japanese are alsoworking on a 10-year project to translate communications signalsautomatically (telephone, telex, and so on) into the language of the countryreceiving the signal.andP;  Like strict natural-language interfaces in a narroelydefined environment, machine translation is ideal for converting technicaldocuments and references from one language into another.andP;  Technicalinformation tends to be factual with little concentration on style, and factsare easily translated.andM;Wide-scale machine translation is difficult partly because of the differencesthat occur between types of languages.andP;  Translations between romancelanguages (English, French, Spanish, Italian) are easier to achieve thanromance to oriental because of cultural and structural similarities.andP;  But anEnglish-to-French translation does not help an English-to-Japanese system inany way, just as the Japanese developments for kanji-to-English will not helpin setting up a kanji-to-Urdu system.andP;  Each new system, therefore, does notlend itself to propagation of other systems, and thus the number of machinetranslators remains small.andM;If you have ever been frustrated trying to decipher the botched Englishinstructions on your Korean VCR, you can thank the inadequacies of currenttranslation teams.andP;  With an increasingly global market and more productsgoing from country to country and language to language, it astounds me thatmore work isn't done in this area.andP;  Still, it's nice to know that no matterhow bad the translation is from language to language, the vodka is alwaysstrong.andP;  I'll drink to that.andM;HArvey P.
