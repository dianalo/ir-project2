Several ministers confirmed on their arrival yesterday that their main concern involves OPEC's continuing high level of output, which reached the year's peak last month, and which could increase further once the Iran-Iraq war ends, as the belligerents try to export more oil to finance their reconstruction.    &quot;Prices are too low,&quot; said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister. But he said the reason is that production is too high. &quot;If we can curb production, we can see some increase in price,&quot; he said.    Neither Mr. Ginandjar nor Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the president of OPEC, ruled out calling an emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers to address the production problem. Calling such a special meeting is just about the only official action the price-monitoring committee can take.    The world's oil industry, including OPEC, is divided over the effects on the cartel of an end to the Iran-Iraq war, which has cast a shadow over OPEC decision-making for eight years. One view is that the two countries will flood oil markets. The other view is that the cessation of hostilities between the two OPEC members will help unify the cartel, making it capable once again of controlling world oil prices.    While not playing down the importance of the issue, some members of the price-monitoring committee questioned whether they should try to address it here. &quot;We will be talking about everything,&quot; said Mr. Lukman, but he added that the effect of a resolution of the war is not a &quot;mandate&quot; for the meeting. Others said the committee can't avoid the subject.    Iran's recent announcement that it would accept a U.N.-sponsored ceasefire came after today's meeting had been scheduled. The meeting had been planned -- secretly, at first -- mainly for jawboning OPEC members that are exceeding their production quotas, specifically the United Arab Emirates. OPEC's new secretary general, Subroto, will report today to the ministers on his recent trip to the emirates, where he won the president's pledge to support OPEC decisions.    Asked yesterday about prior promises of the emirates to adhere to the quotas while continuing to overproduce, Mr. Subroto replied: &quot;Let's give the benefit of the doubt to what the president said.&quot;    The last industry estimate suggests that the United Arab Emirates continues to produce near its targeted level of 1.5 million barrels a day, some 500,000 barrels a day above their OPEC quota. Total OPEC production has declined in recent days to between 18 million and 19 million barrels a day after reaching the year's high of 20.2 million barrels a day at mid-July. </TEXT></DOC>
