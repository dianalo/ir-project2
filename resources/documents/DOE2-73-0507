The local community contributedover $62,000 to the Clatsop Economic Development Committee FisheriesProject in 1986. That amounted to about 30% of the overall budget. Smoltmigration from the earthen rearing ponds was accomplished volitionally.The larger smolts (13 fish/pound) left the ponds more readily, and alsocontributed to the various fisheries at a higher percentage than didsmaller smolts (15 fish/pound). In 1986, the CEDC Fisheries Project rearedand released a total of 3.7 million salmon. Approximately 400,000 ofthe total were coho, 3 million were lower Columbia stock chinook, and250,000 were Rogue River stock fall chinook.</TEXT></DOC>
