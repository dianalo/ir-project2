Such Wall Street giants as Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., MorganStanley Group Inc., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc. began extensive internal reviews last week oftheir Treasury securities trading operations. The reviewsbegan in the wake of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s disclosure thatit repeatedly violated bidding rules at the Treasury'smultibillion-dollar note auctions.</LP><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission has so far sentsubpoenas to most of the 40 primary dealers, large commercialand investment banks that are authorized to trade Treasurysecurities directly with the Federal Reserve and that agreeto bid regularly at Treasury auctions.   The SEC subpoenas indicate that the federal agency istrying to find out whether other dealers committed the samesort of violations to which Salomon acknowledged. The SEC isrequesting information on whether the dealers had eversubmitted unauthorized bids in customers' names and whetherthey had violated Treasury rules that bar anyone from buyingmore than 35% of a single issue at a Treasury auction.Salomon has said that it engaged in both practices. The SECalso asked for information on the firms' internal controlsfor spotting violations, and, in some instances, for tradingrecords dating back to January 1990.   Individuals familiar with the investigation said that theSEC had also sought information from more than two dozeninstitutions that had bid for Treasury notes through Salomon.Those clients were asked to submit trading records relatingto those bids by the end of this month.   &quot;It appears {the regulators} are trying to establish howwidespread the Solly conduct was in the industry,&quot; saidEugene McInerney, an executive vice president of DeutscheBank who heads the government-securities bidding operationsat the bank's unit. The SEC, he said, &quot;is asking the dealercommunity whether anyone violated the rules.&quot;   The Department of Justice also appears to be stepping upits investigation into Salomon, which has admitted violatingbidding rules in at least four auctions. More than 10 federalantitrust lawyers are investigating the securities firm,along with lawyers from the Justice Department's criminaldivision. A Justice Department official said yesterday, &quot;Thisis a very high-priority matter now.&quot;   Also, Salomon said it is being investigated by the NewYork Stock Exchange. Salomon is a Big Board member.   In recent weeks, Justice Department lawyers have talkedwith attorneys and principals of at least three Salomonclients who participated in an auction of two-year Treasurynotes in May. Individuals familiar with the investigationsaid those clients include Steinhardt Partners, a NewYork-based hedge fund; Quantum Fund, led by New York investorGeorge Soros; and Tiger Management Co. Salomon submitted abid on behalf of Tiger without Tiger's knowledge, along withanother bid that was authorized, the people said. None ofthese clients has been told it is under investigation or hasdone anything wrong.   A spokesman for Salomon said: &quot;The new management of thefirm is helping the government in every way possible in itsinvestigations.&quot; The spokesman said that Salomon executivesfor years have been urged to invest their money with privatefund managers in discretionary accounts to avoid distractionsand conflicts of interest. These accounts have includedSteinhardt Partners.   Salomon has admitted to acquiring 44% of the notes at theMay auction. Salomon has said that one client appeared tohave sold back to Salomon some $500 million of notes soonafter the auction, an action that enabled Salomon to exceedthe 35% limit.   Attorneys for Steinhardt and a spokesman for TigerManagement declined to comment, and an attorney for Mr. Soroswasn't available.   The Treasury has studied all of its note and bond auctionssince 1986, a total of more than 200 auctions, to determinewhether dealers might have colluded with customers to exceedthe 35% limit. But so far, Treasury officials have foundlittle evidence that firms other than Salomon submitted bidsthat exceeded 35% of an issue, even if customer bids areincluded. &quot;We think the Salomon situation was isolated,&quot; saidone government official with knowledge of the study.   Meanwhile, a large Salomon client withdrew itsgovernment-bond business yesterday. The $63 billionCalifornia Public Employees Retirement System, citing its&quot;outrage and disappointment in the illegal activities&quot; ofSalomon, said it wouldn't trade government securities throughSalomon while the government continues to investigate thefirm's auction practices.   The California fund, known as Calpers, said it was placingSalomon on probation, meaning that it could sever all itsbusiness ties with the firm. &quot;It's a warning that you havedone wrong, and that you had better correct your ways,&quot; saidDeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer of Calpers, thenation's largest public employee pension fund.   Salomon accounts for about 15% of Calpers' trading ingovernment bonds. But Salomon does far more business withCalpers in other areas, such as trading mortgage-backedsecurities. The suspension won't affect those other areas.   As reported, the $26 billion Wisconsin Investment Boardsaid last week that it had suspended all its business withSalomon and its affiliates until questions about the auctionviolations are resolved. Some other pension funds have saidthey are considering such actions.   But the number of known defectors among Salomon'sinstitutional investors remains very small. &quot;It's wait andsee for us,&quot; said a spokesman for the $10.5 billion Coloradostate employee pension fund in a comment echoed by severalother Salomon customers.   Salomon said it regretted the Calpers decision,&quot;particularly in view of our new management and improvedcontrol procedures.&quot; Salomon has instituted a variety ofchanges to its Treasury-auction procedures in the past week,and named new top officers, including investor Warren Buffettas chairman.</TEXT></DOC>
