WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Richard von Weizsaecker wasre-elected today to a second term as head of state in the firstuncontested presidential vote in the nation's history.   A special assembly of legislators and appointed electors that isconvened every five years re-elected the 69-year-old ChristianDemocrat with 881 votes of the 1,022 cast, or 86.2 percent.   Each of the five political parties represented in the federalparliament was entitled to nominate a candidate. That none did waslargely a reflection of the respect Weizsaecker has won.   He was endorsed by all but the far-left Greens Party.   Weizsaecker, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservativeChristian Democratic Union, has transformed the largely ceremonialpost of president into an influential position of elder statesman.   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth opened the federalconvention in Bonn's sprawling Beethoven Hall with words of praisefor Weizsaecker, the sixth man to serve as West German presidentsince the nation was founded on May 24, 1949.   Today was the eve of West Germany's 40th birthday celebration.   Ms. Suessmuth said the mandate of the federal presidency was toshape ``a common democracy that binds the confrontational powers inthe government and opposition.''   ``These are serious responsibilities and I wish for us thestrength to bear them successfully,'' Weizsaecker said in a shortacceptance speech.   Among the delegates sent by West Germany's 11 states were formerchancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, actors, artists andelected officials.   Weizsaecker won worldwide praise for his effort to bring fellowGermans to terms with the holocaust in a 1985 address marking the40th anniversary of the German capitulation in World War II.   Weizseacker also has called for a fair assessment of theaccomplishments of a nation built on the ruins of Nazi Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
