The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court inManhattan, alleged that Mr. Lewis committed fraud andviolated record-keeping rules in connection with AmericanExpress Co.'s sale of part of its Fireman's Fund Corp. stakein 1986. The SEC accused Mr. Lewis of manipulating the priceof Fireman's Fund stock with the help of Jefferies andamp; Co., aLos Angeles brokerage firm.</LP><TEXT>   Last August, Mr. Lewis, 50 years old, pleaded guilty tothree felony counts in connection with the stock-manipulationscheme. He was sentenced to three years' probation and fined$250,000.   In settling the SEC civil suit, Mr. Lewis neither admittednor denied the allegations. His attorney, Theodore Wells Jr.,said, &quot;Although we believe no one was hurt by the trades inquestion and there were no financial losses by investors inthe marketplace, the settlement was made to avoid lengthy andcostly litigation with the government.&quot;   The SEC said that the $475,000 is meant to partially makeup for the effect of Mr. Lewis's actions on the market priceof Fireman's Fund stock at the time.   As part of the settlement, Mr. Lewis also agreed not toviolate any securities laws in the future. Mr. Lewis, ofShort Hills, N.J., was formerly head of S.B. Lewis andamp; Co., asecurities broker and dealer.   The SEC said that in the stock-manipulation scheme, Mr.Lewis arranged for Jefferies to cause the price of Fireman'sFund stock to close at a certain level on May 8, 1986, sothat American Express could sell its stake at a moreadvantageous price. In return, Mr. Lewis told Boyd Jefferies,then chairman of the brokerage firm, that he would make upfor any loss that Mr. Jefferies sustained on the transaction.   At the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Lewis said he made thearrangement with Jefferies in an attempt to counter theefforts of so-called short sellers who were trying to drivedown the price of the stock before a planned secondaryoffering.   ---   FREEZE ON SPENDING by Manville trust is extended untilSept. 6.   The order by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court inBrooklyn, N.Y., gives the asbestos personal-injury trustadditional time to restructure its financing. Last month thejudge had set yesterday as the deadline for the trust to comeup with financing changes to solve its cash shortage. But heagreed to extend the deadline after hearing a report frombankruptcy-court special adviser Leon Silverman, who saidprogress was being made in solving the trust's money woes.   The trust, which is independent of Denver-based ManvilleCorp., was set up in 1986 to pay all asbestos personal-injuryclaims against the company. The trust was the cornerstone ofManville's bankruptcy-court reorganization plan.   At a joint hearing before Judge Weinstein and New Yorkstate Justice Helen Freedman, Mr. Silverman said discussionsare under way to come up with cash for the trust and toreduce its operating expenses. Although he wouldn't disclosedetails, Mr. Silverman said, &quot;We have identified means forrefinancing the trust to provide meaningful funds for theshort term&quot; without jeopardizing the trust's long-termfinancing.   Mr. Silverman said at the hearing that other changes arebeing made to reduce the likelihood that asbestos victimswill take the trust to court, rather than settle theirclaims. That would translate into major savings for thetrust, since litigation costs are its largest expense. Forinstance, changes are likely to be made in determining whichclaims are paid first, and the trust is seeking tostandardize the amount it pays on certain asbestos claims.   After the hearing, Mr. Silverman said he thinks anagreement in principle can be reached on the refinancing bySept. 6.   Despite Mr. Silverman's report, Judge Weinstein criticizedthe company's response so far to the trust's problems. &quot;I'mnot convinced that management understands the seriousness ofthis matter,&quot; said Judge Weinstein, who has authority overall issues arising out of Manville's bankruptcy-lawreorganization. &quot;{Manville's} management may not act as ifthey are bound only by the letter of those agreements thatset up the trust.&quot;   Thomas Stephens, Manville's chief executive officer,declined to say what steps the company is considering takingto aid the trust. But he said, &quot;There is no higher priorityto the company, and we are giving it our full attention.&quot;   Also, Judge Weinstein said he will rule on a motionseeking a class action for all asbestos personal-injuryclaims after a meeting of federal judges in WashingtonFriday.   The judges are meeting to come up with a national approachto easing the backlog of asbestos cases in the courts.   ---   A FORMER BROKER WINS $23.4 million defamation award fromDean Witter.   The former commodities broker, who was fired from DeanWitter Reynolds Inc. in 1982, successfully claimed that theSears, Roebuck andamp; Co. unit had libeled and slandered him infilings with securities exchanges and in a statement to apotential employer.   The jury verdict, which includes more than $15 million inpunitive damages, is believed to be one of the largestdefamation verdicts in Texas. Two Dean Witter employees werealso defendants.   Daniel Waite, who his lawyer says earned approximately$400,000 a year, alleged in state district court in Houstonthat Dean Witter filed false termination forms with theCommodities Futures Trading Commission, the ChicagoMercantile Exchange and other securities and commoditiesexchanges. On the form, called a U-5, Dean Witter claimedthat Mr. Waite had violated a New York Mercantile Exchangeregulation requiring the brokerage firm to know the locationof the commodities covered by the commodities contract,according to Michael D. Sydow, Mr. Waite's lawyer in Houston.   But, according to Mr. Sydow, a New York MercantileExchange official testified that the regulation was only aproposed rule. On the U-5, the company also wrote that Mr.Waite was fired &quot;as a result of this incident anddemonstrated inability to follow other company policies.&quot;   In a statement, Dean Witter spokesman James M. Flynn saidthe company is &quot;disappointed and surprised&quot; about theverdict. &quot;It has always been our policy to comply with allregulatory requirements and to conduct our business in thebest interests of our clients. After careful review of theseresponsibilities and requirements, we believe our actionsregarding this matter were taken in good faith.&quot;   He said Dean Witter planned to appeal the verdict.   ---   A CAR DEALER FILED an unusual suit blaming GM for hisfirm's collapse.   The dealer, who had filed for bankruptcy-court protection,alleges that General Motors Corp.'s GMAC finance arm set upthe &quot;financial dismantling&quot; of his 35-franchise empire bypushing him to expand rapidly by taking on heavy debt andthen tightening the credit reins.   In the lender-liability suit, Richard T. Pepe of Vineland,N.J., is trying to establish that GMAC, in effect, became hispartner by arranging loans that covered more than 100% of theprice he paid for additional franchises in the 1980s. Mr.Pepe, who said he paid himself $3.5 million a year, isseeking $115 million from GMAC for his business failure.   Industry officials fear such suits may become more commonas car dealers who became overextended in the booming salesyears of the late-1980s increasingly fail in the currentclimate of lower sales, lower margins and higher interestrates.   General Motors declined to comment on the suit.   ---   Bradley A. Stertz contributed to this column.</TEXT></DOC>
