As previously reported, the divestiture is required by a Connecticut law under which a New England banking concern can't merge with a bank outside the area and still own a Connecticut bank. Fleet-Norstar was formed Jan. 1 when Fleet Financial Group Inc. of Providence, R.I., acquired Norstar Bancorp, Albany, N.Y.    The Connecticut banking department also gave Fleet-Norstar until today to provide it with a formal plan of divestiture for the unit, First Connecticut Bancorp. In Providence, a spokesman for Fleet-Norstar said the company will file the divesture plan today, but he wouldn't disclose details.    The spokesman added that Fleet-Norstar remains optimistic that the Connecticut Legislature will revise the state law to allow the company to retain the unit. </TEXT></DOC>
