(formerly Cities Service Oil and Gas Corporation, successorin interest to Cities Service Company) (``Cities Service''). The agreementproposes to resolve matters relating to Occidental's compliance with thefederal petroleum price and allocation regulations for the period October1, 1979 through January 27, 1981. If this Consent Order is made final,Occidental would pay to the DOE two hundred five million eighty thousanddollars ($205,080,000). Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date of theConsent Order, Occidental shall make an initial payment to the DOE of fortymillion dollars ($40,000,000), and thereafter eight (8) equal annual paymentsof twenty million six hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($20,635,000)each, including interest. Payments made pursuant to the Consent Order willbe distributed by the DOE pursuant to the special refund procedures prescribedby 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. This Consent Order would not affect theConsent Order between Cities Service and DOE dated October 31, 1979, which,except as otherwise provided therein, covered the period August 19, 1973,through September 30, 1979. DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) will be petitioned to implementSpecial Refund Procedures for distributing moneys received from Occidental.Any persons who claim to have suffered injury from Occidental's allegedovercharges would have the opportunity to submit claims for payment insuch proceedings. Pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199J, ERA will receive written comments on the proposedConsent Order for thirty (30) days following publication of this Notice.ERA will consider all comments received from the public in determiningwhether to accept the settlement and issue a final Order, renegotiate theagreement and issue a modified agreement as a final Order, or reject thesettlement. DOE's final decision will be published in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> along with a summary and analysis of the significantwritten comments, as well as any other considerations that were relevantto the final decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Dorothy Hamid, Economic RegulatoryAdministration, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington,DC 20585, (202) 586-1699.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:</T2> <ITAG tagnum="25">I.

Resolution of Regulatory Issues </ITAG>Occidental is a successor in interest to Cities Service Company (CitiesService), which was a refiner, producer, and reseller subject to the auditjurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with the Federal PetroleumPrice and Allocation Regulations. During the period covered by this proposedOrder (October 1, 1979 through January 27, 1981), Cities Service engagedin, among other things, the production, importation, purchase, sale, exchangeand refining of crude oil and the purchase and sale of refined product.As a result of its audits, the DOE raised certain issues with respect tocertain related purchases and sales of crude oil in which Cities Servicesold price-controlled crude oil to resellers and concurrently purchaseddiscounted exempt-certified crude oil from those resellers. On March 5,1985, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Cities Service allegingovercharges resulting from these transactions. On September 30, 1988, theDepartment of Energy's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) issued thePRO as a Remedial Order (RO) for $263.8 million, plus interest which wouldcurrently total approximately $450 million. The RO is currently on appealbefore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Determination of Reasonable Settlement Amount </ITAG>To discharge in full Occidental's potential liability for the period October1, 1979 through January 27, 1981 under the price and allocation regulations,\1\<NOTE/> the settlement calls for Occidental to pay a total of $205.08million, including interest at the rate of 10.02 percent per annum.\2\<NOTE/> The Consent Order requires Occidental to make an initialpayment of $40 million within ten days of the effective date, and eightannual payments of $20.635 million each thereafter. Under the terms ofthe proposed Consent Order, the ERA would petition the OHA to implementSpecial Refund Procedures for disposition of the settlement funds pursuantto Subpart V.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In a previous Consent Order dated October 31, 1979, andgenerally covering the period August 19, 1973 through September 30, 1979,Cities Service agreed to price rollback, refund and bank reduction remediestotalling $177.4 million. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ At the same per annum discount rate, the present valueof the agreement is approximately $150 million.ERA has preliminarily agreed to the settlement amount after consideringthe factual aspects related to the various issues currently in disputein the litigation, assessing the litigation risks associated with establishingthe alleged overcharges, and considering the benefit to the public froma significant settlement of a number of issues which would take years ofcontinued litigation to resolve. Additionally, there are equitable andlegal considerations specific to the Cities Service litigation.The PRO specifically concerns 91 reciprocal crude oil transactions betweenCities Service and thirteen crude oil resellers during the periods October1979 through April 1980, and September 1980 through January 27, 1981. Ineach of the tied transactions, Cities Service sold a reseller primarilyprice-controlled crude oil (lower tier, upper tier, or a combination ofthe two) and purchased from the same reseller an equal volume of stripper-,foreign-, or upper tier-Alaskan North Slope crude oil at substantial below-marketdiscounts. The PRO alleges that Cities Service charged for its price-controlledcrude oil a price in excess of that permitted by 10 CFR andSection; 212.183(b),the price rule applicable to crude oil resales by a refiner, through itsreceipt from its reseller trading partners of discounts on stripper-certifiedand other entitlements purchase-exempt crude oil. The PRO also allegedthat Cities Service's conduct violated the anti-circumvention rules at10 CFR 210.62(c) and 205.202.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In April 1988, ERA sought to amend the PRO to charge thatCities Service in the subject transactions also violated 10 CFR 211.66,which governed a refiner's preparation of its Refiner Monthly Reports,and therefore detrimentally impacted the crude oi1 entitlements program.The OHA, in its RO decision issued on September 30, 1988, granted the motionto amend, but remanded to ERA that portion of the PRO with respect to theissues raised by the amendment. Thus, OHA permitted a new PRO proceedingin which Cities Service would be given further opportunity to fully litigatethose issues. For settlement purposes, the ERA took into consideration those policy issuesand litigation risk factors present in all settlement negotiations. Thetotal amount of Occidental's potential liability resulting from the subjecttransactions could only be recovered by the government if, in litigation,all issues were resolved in the DOE's favor. The risks inherent in suchlitigation make such an outcome uncertain. In assessing those litigation risks, the ERA considered Cities Service'scontentions that: (1) The enforcement proceeding is barred by (a) judicialestoppel, by reason of the Government's representations to the federaldistrict court in Cities Service's 1981 declaratory judgment action againstDOE,\4\<NOTE/> and by (b) collateral estoppel, by reason of the DOE GeneralCounsel's position in <T3>Cities Service Co.,</T3> Interpretation 1980-43, 45 Fed. Reg. 82575(December 15, 1980), that DOE was unable at that time to determine thelawfulness of Cities Service's proposed crude oil transaction outlinedin the firm's request for interpretation; (2) ERA delayed in commencingenforcement action against Cities Service due to its inability to determinethe lawfulness of the transaction in question; (3) the 91 transactionsat issue in the PRO were ``matching purchases and sales'' in the natureof ``exchanges'' and therefore not subject to the crude oil resale priceregulations in 10 CFR Part 212, Subpart L; (4) DOE regulations did notprohibit ``tier trading''; (5) Cities Service's net benefit from its ``tiertrades'' was substantially less than the overcharge amount alleged by ERA.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>Cities Service Co.</T3> v. <T3>DOE,</T3> 520 F. Supp. 1132 (D. Del. 1981), <T3>aff'd per curiam,</T3> No. 3-28 (TECA August 27, 1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Cities Service's ``net benefit'' argument involves complexeconometric models utilizing multiple regression analysis, the expert testimonyof economists and statisticians, and extensive documentary materials. Whilethe RO decision issued by OHA rejected Cities Service's arguments in thisregard, consideration of the benefit actually received is appropriate inthe context of settlement, along with litigation probabilities. More recent developments that ERA took into consideration include an adverseMagistrate's report and recommendation (hereinafter Magistrate's report)in another case, <T3>Canal Refining Co.</T3> v. <T3>DOE,</T3> Civil Action No. 87-C-294-E (N.D. Okla.) (hereinafter <T3>Canal</T3>). The Magistrate's report in the <T3>Canal</T3> case made a determination which, if accepted by the districtcourt, would have found that no violations existed for the same kind oftransactions that are at issue between the DOE and Cities Service.\6\<NOTE/> The Magistrate refused to accept ERA's position on the applicationof 10 CFR 212.183(b) to so-called tier trading, and instead recommendedthat the district court reverse in its entirety the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission's decision upholding the Department's Remedial Order issuedto Canal. The Department sought and was granted expunction of the Magistrate'sReport on January 5, 1989. While the Department was successful in its effortsto have the Magistrate's report expunged, thereby avoiding the risk thatthe recommended decision could be cited or relied upon as precedent, thecompromise resolution proposed today reflects the DOE's concerns aboutthe implications of such an adverse rationale for the case against CitiesService, which is still in the administrative appeal stage.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Cities Service had sought intervenor status in the case,but a decision on the request had not been made before the <T3>Canal</T3> matter was resolved between the parties. Nevertheless, theMagistrate relied heavily on the <T3>amicus curiae</T3> briefs filed by Cities Service in making his reportand recommendation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Of related concern is the fact that upon a decision bythe FERC favorable to DOE, Cities Service could appeal the decision tothe same federal court, the Northern District of Oklahoma. In its preliminary assessments of reasonable settlement value, the mostsignificant factors considered by the ERA were: the perceived risks inthe litigation, including the potential for a lesser remedial award thanthat sought in the current litigation; the early efforts by Cities Serviceto obtain clarification of the DOE's legal position regarding the transactionsnow at issue; the fact that formal action was not initiated for nearlyfive years after the questions arose; and in the context of this particularcase, in which legal clarification was sought and enforcement action didnot commence until some years later, the fact that the interest soughtin the litigation (calculated at prime rates and compounded quarterly)comprises nearly two-thirds of the total current claims.Based on all of these factors, ERA's preliminary determination is thatOccidental's agreement to the terms of a proposed Consent Order constitutesa settlement which is in the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Terms and Conditions of the Consent Order </ITAG>If the Consent Order is made final, Occidental will pay DOE a total of$205.08 million. The text of the proposed Consent Order is published herewith.ERA will petition OHA to implement Special Refund Procedures under theprovisions of Subpart V of the regulations. In these proceedings, OHA woulddevelop procedures for the receipt and evaluation of applications for refundin order to distribute the settlement moneys. To ensure that OHA has sufficientinformation to evaluate the claims, the proposed Consent Order requiresthat Occidental provide customer identification and purchase volume informationto OHA upon request. Occidental and DOE mutually release each other from claims and actionsarising under the subject matters covered by the proposed Consent Order.The proposed Order does not affect the right of any other party to takeaction against Occidental, or of Occidental or the DOE to take action againstany other party. <ITAG tagnum="84">Submission of Written Comments </ITAG>The proposed Consent Order cannot be made effective until the conclusionof the public review process, of which this Notice is a part. Interested parties are invited to submit written comments concerning thisproposed Consent Order to: Occidental Consent Order Comments, RG-30, EconomicRegulatory Administration, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC20585. Any information or data considered confidential by the person submittingit must be identified as such in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR205.9(f). All comments received by the thirtieth day following publication of thisNotice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>will be considered before determining whetherto adopt the proposed Consent Order as a final Order. Any modificationsof the proposed Consent Order which significantly alter its terms or impactwill be published for additional comments. If, after considering the commentsit has received, ERA determines to issue the proposed Consent Order asa final Order, the proposed Order will be made final and effective by publicationof a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on May 19, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Chandler L. van Orman, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Consent Order </ITAG>I. Introduction 101. This Consent Order is entered into between Occidental Petroleum Corporation(``Occidental''), including its wholly owned subsidiary OXY USA, Inc. (formerlyCities Service Oil and Gas Corporation, successor in interest to CitiesService Company) (``Cities Service''), and the United States Departmentof Energy (``DOE''). Except as otherwise provided herein, this ConsentOrder settles and finally resolves all civil and administrative claimsand disputes, whether or not heretofore asserted, between the DOE, as hereinafterdefined, and Occidental, as hereinafter defined, relating to Occidental'scompliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations,as hereinafter defined, during the period October 1, 1979, through January27, 1981 (all the matters settled and resolved by this Consent Order arereferred to hereinafter as ``the matters covered by this Consent Order'').This Consent Order does not affect the Consent Order between Cities Serviceand DOE dated October 31, 1979, which, except as otherwise provided therein,covered the period August 19, 1973, through September 30, 1979.II. Jurisdiction, Regulatory Authority and Definitions 201. This Consent Order is entered into by the DOE pursuant to the authorityconferred upon it by sections 301 and 503 of the Department of Energy OrganizationAct (``DOE Act''), 42 U.S.C. 7151 and 7193, Executive Order No. 12009,42 FR 46267 (1977); Executive Order No. 12038, 43 FR 4957 (1978); and 10CFR 205.199J. 202. For purposes of this Consent Order, the. phrase ``federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations'' means all statutory requirements andadministrative regulations and orders regarding the pricing and allocationof crude oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids, and naturalgas liquid products, including the entitlements and mandatory oil importprograms, administered by the DOE. The federal petroleum price and allocationregulations include (without limitation) the pricing, allocation, reporting,certification, and recordkeeping requirements imposed by or under the EconomicStabilization Act of 1970, the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973,the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, the DOE Act, any and allamendments to said acts, Presidential Proclamation 3279, all applicableDOE regulations codified in 6 CFR Parts 130 and 150 and 10 CFR Parts 205,210, 211, 212, and 213, and all rules, rulings, guidelines, interpretations,clarifications, manuals, decisions, orders, notices, forms, and subpoenasrelating to the pricing and allocation of petroleum products. The provisionsof 10 CFR 205.199J and the definitions under the federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations shall apply to this Consent Order except tothe extent inconsistent herewith. Reference herein to ``DOE'' includes,besides the Department of Energy, the Cost of Living Council, the FederalEnergy Office, the Federal Energy Administration, the Office of SpecialCounsel, the Economic Regulatory Administration and all agencies succeedingto the DOE's authority to administer or enforce the federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations. References in this Consent Order to ``Occidental''shall include: (I) Occidental Petroleum Corporation, its subsidiaries andaffiliates, and its and their predecessors, Cities Service Company andCities Service Oil and Gas Corporation, and their subsidiaries and affiliates,(2) all of Occidental's petroleum-related activities, whether as a refiner,producer, operator, working interest or royalty interest owner, reseller,retailer, natural gas processor, or otherwise, and (3) Occidental's presentand former directors, officers, and employees. III. Facts The stipulated facts upon which this Consent Order is based are as follows:301. During the period covered by this Consent Order, Occidental was a``refiner'', ``producer'' and ``reseller'' as those terms are defined inthe federal petroleum price and allocation regulations and was subjectto the jurisdiction of the DOE. 302. On October 31, 1979, Cities Service and the DOE entered into a ConsentOrder which settled alI claims and disputes against Cities Service by theDOE, except as otherwise provided therein, for the period August 19, 1973,through September 30, 1979, with respect to the statutory and regulatorypetroleum programs administered and enforced by DOE and its predecessoragencies. 303. Following the 1979 Consent Order, the DOE audited Cities Service'scompliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulationsfor the period after September 30, 1979. As a result, the DOE raised certainissues with respect to certain related purchases and sales of crude oilin which Cities Service sold price-controlled crude oil to resellers andpurchased exempt-certified crude oil from those resellers. The DOE initiateda formal enforcement action alleging that these transactions violated certainprovisions of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. CitiesService maintains, however, that its conduct with respect to these transactionswas in all respects lawful and in accordance with the federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations. The DOE and Cities Service have eachasserted its belief that its respective legal and factual positions regardingsuch transactions are meritorious. These positions were emphasized in theintensive review and exchange of information conducted during the audit,during litigation of those issues, and during the settlement negotiationprocess. However, in order to avoid the expense of protracted and complexlitigation and the disruption of its orderly business functions, Occidentalhas agreed to enter into this Consent Order, which, among other things,resolves both the principal and interest component of the claims that theDOE has asserted against Cities Service in connection with the above- describedtransactions. The DOE believes this Consent Order constitutes a satisfactoryresolution of the matters covered herein and is in the public interest.IV. Remedial Provisions 401. In full and final settlement of all matters covered by this ConsentOrder and in lieu of all other remedies which have been or might be soughtby the DOE against Occidental for such matters under 10 CFR 205.199I orotherwise, Occidental shall pay a total amount, including interest, oftwo hundred five million eighty thousand dollars ($205,080,000.00) to theDOE in the manner specified in paragraphs 402, 403, 404, and 405. 402. Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date of this Consent Order,Occidental shall make an initial payment to the DOE of forty million dollars($40,000,000.00). 403. Beginning one year after the Effective Date of this Consent Order,Occidental shall make eight (8) equal annual payments to the DOE of twentymillion six hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($20,635,000.00) each,which amounts include the payment of interest calculated at the rate of10.02 percent per annum. The foregoing payments shall be made on successiveanniversaries of the Effective Date of this Consent Order, unless any suchanniversary is not a business day, in which event payment shall be dueon the first business day following such anniversary. 404. Payments received after the due date shall include additional interest,calculated at the rate of 10.02 percent per annum for the first fifteen(15) days after the due date and 20.04 percent per annum thereafter. 405. The payments pursuant to paragraphs 402 through 404 shall be madeby wire transfer in accordance with instructions furnished to Occidentalby the DOE in a timely manner. 406. Payments made pursuant to this Consent Order shall be distributedby the DOE pursuant to the special refund procedures prescribed by 10 CFRPart 205, Subpart V. V. Issues Resolved 501. All pending and potential civil and administrative claims, whetheror not known, demands, liabilities, causes of action or other proceedingsby the DOE against Occidental regarding Occidental's compliance with andobligations under the federal petroleum price and allocation regulationsduring the period covered by this Consent Order, whether or not heretoforeraised by an issue letter, Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of ProposedDisallowance, Proposed Remedial Order, Remedial Order, actions in courtor otherwise, are resolved and extinguished as to Occidental by this ConsentOrder. This Consent Order, however, does not resolve, extinguish, or otherwiseaffect DOE's claims against any other party. 502. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, compliance by Occidentalwith this Consent Order shall be deemed by the DOE to constitute full compliancefor administrative and civil purposes with all federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations for matters covered by this Consent Order. Inconsideration for performance as required under this Consent Order by Occidental,the DOE hereby releases Occidental completely and for all purposes fromall administrative and civil judicial claims, demands, liabilities or causesof action, including, without limitation, claims for civil penalties thatthe DOE has asserted or might otherwise be able to assert against Occidentalbefore or after the date of this Consent Order for alleged violations ofthe federal petroleum price and allocation regulations with respect tomatters covered by this Consent Order. The DOE will not initiate or prosecuteany such administrative or civil judicial matter against Occidental orcause or refer any such matter to be initiated or prosecuted, nor willthe DOE or its successors directly or indirectly aid in the initiationof any such administrative or civil judicial matter against Occidentalor participate voluntarily in the prosecution of such actions. The DOEwill not assert voluntarily in any administrative or civil judicial proceedingthat Occidental has violated the federal petroleum price and allocationregulations with respect to the matters covered by this Consent Order orotherwise take any action with respect to Occidental in derogation of thisConsent Order. However, nothing contained herein shall preclude the DOEfrom defending the validity of the federal petroleum price and allocationregulations. (b) This Consent Order settles and finally resolves all aspects of Occidental'spotential liability to the DOE under the federal petroleum price and allocationregulations, including but not limited to its capacity as an operator orworking interest or royalty interest owner of a crude oil producing property.In addition, if Occidental was the operator of a property that producedcrude oil for all or part of the period covered by this Consent Order,the DOE shall not initiate or prosecute any enforcement action againstany person for noncompliance with the federal petroleum price and allocationregulations during such period relative to such property. Otherwise, theDOE reserves the right to initiate and prosecute enforcement actions againstany person other than Occidental for noncompliance with the federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations, including suits against operators forovercharges for crude oil when Occidental is a working interest or royaltyinterest owner in such crude oil production. In that connection, Occidentaland the DOE agree that the amount paid to the DOE pursuant to this ConsentOrder is not attributable to Occidental's activities as a working interestor royalty interest owner on properties on which it is not the operator.Furthermore, Occidental and the DOE agree that the Consent Order and thepayments hereunder do not resolve, reduce or release the liability of anyother person for violations on properties of which (but only for the timesduring which) Occidental is or was a working interest or royalty interestowner (and not the operator) or affect any rights or obligations betweenOccidental and the operator or any other working interest or royalty interestowner. (c) The DOE will not seek or recommend any criminal fines or penaltiesbased on information or evidence presently in its possession for the matterscovered by this Consent Order, provided, however, that nothing in thisConsent Order precludes the DOE from (1) seeking or recommending such criminalfines or penalties if information subsequently coming to its attentionindicates, either by itself or in combination with information or evidencepresently known to DOE, that a criminal violation may have occurred or(2) otherwise complying with its obligations under law with regard to forwardinginformation of possible criminal violations of law to appropriate authorities.Nothing contained herein may be construed as a bar, estoppel or defenseagainst any criminal or civil action brought by an agency of the UnitedStates other than the DOE under (i) section 210 of the Economic StabilizationAct of 1970 or (ii) any statute or regulation other than the federal petroleumprice and allocation regulations. Finally, this Consent Order does notprejudice the rights of any third party or Occidental in any private action,including an action for contribution by or against Cities Service. (d) Occidental releases the DOE completely and for all purposes from alladministrative and civil judicial claims, liabilities or causes of actionthat Occidental has asserted or may otherwise be able to assert againstthe DOE relating to the DOE's administration of the federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations. This release, however, does not preclude Occidentalfrom asserting any factual or legal position or argument as a defense toany action, claim, or proceeding brought by the DOE, the United States,or any agency of the United States. Nor does it preclude Occidental fromasserting a defense, counterclaim or offset to any action, claim or proceedingbrought by any other person. Further, Occidental waives all claims thatit has asserted or may assert in proceedings before the Office of Hearingsand Appeals (``OHA'') pursuant to 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. Occidentalalso agrees that, within fifteen (15) days following the Effective Dateof this Consent Order, it shall (1) cause the withdrawal of the requestmade by its attorneys Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim andamp; Ballon, onJuly 20, 1988, for documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act,5 U.S.C. section 552, <T3>et seq.</T3>; and (2) provide to the Permian Corporation or its successorin interest (``Permian''), in a form acceptable to DOE, written noticeto Permian that Occidental will not assert against Permian, in responseto a claim by Permian for reimbursement or indemnification for any judgmentthat might be entered against it, or any settlement that might be reached,in <T3>Amber Refining, Inc., et al. </T3>v. <T3>The Permian Corporation</T3>, No. C.A. 4-83-443-K (N.D. Tex.), thatFermian should have sought reimbursement or indemnification from the escrowfund established in the Consent Order entered into on March 5, 1982, betweenPermian and the DOE and made effective on June 25, 1982. 503. (a) Within fifteen (15) days after the execution of the Consent Orderby both parties, DOE agrees to join with Occidental in written notificationto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') of the fact of suchexecution, which notice shall request that said administrative tribunalstay all further action in the proceeding styled <T3>Cities Service Oil and Gas Corporation</T3>, No. RO-89-2-000, untilsuch time as the Consent Order has become effective or has been withdrawnpursuant to Article IX of this Consent Order. (b) Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date of this Consent Order,Occidental and the DOE will file or cause to be filed appropriate pleadingsand will take all other steps necessary to withdraw all claims and dismisswith prejudice all proceedings covered by this Consent Order then pendingbefore the DOE's OHA or the FERC, and to dismiss with prejudice any courtproceeding then pending involving an appeal from or seeking review of adecision by the OHA or the FERC in any such proceeding. 504. Execution of this Consent Order constitutes neither an admission byOccidental nor a finding by the DOE of any violation by Occidental of anystatute or regulation. The DOE has determined that it is not appropriateto seek to impose civil penalties for the matters covered by this ConsentOrder, and the DOE will not seek any such civil penalties. None of thepayments or expenditures made by Occidental pursuant to this Consent Orderare to be considered for any purpose as penalties, fines, or forfeituresor as settlement of any potential liability for penalties, fines or forfeitures.505. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, with respect to the matterscovered by this Consent Order, the DOE reserves the right to initiate anenforcement proceeding or to seek appropriate penalties for any newly discoveredregulatory violations committed by Occidental, but only if Occidental hasconcealed facts relating to such violations. The DOE also reserves theright to seek appropriate judicial remedies, other than full rescissionof this Consent Order, for any misrepresentation of fact by Occidentalmaterial to this Consent Order during the course of the audit or the negotiationsthat preceded this Consent Order or upon discovery of information thatis materially inconsistent with the information which has been furnishedby Occidental upon which this agreement is based. VI. Recordkeeping, Reporting and Confidentiality 601. Occidental shall maintain such records as are necessary to demonstratecompliance with the terms of this Consent Order. Except for such records,Occidental is relieved of its obligation to comply with the recordkeepingrequirements of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulationsrelating to the matters settled by this Consent Order. 602. Except for formal requests for information regarding compliance byother firms with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations,Occidental will not be subject to any audit requests, report orders, subpoenas,or other administrative discovery by DOE relating to Occidental's activitiessubject to such regulations relating to the matters settled by this ConsentOrder.603. The DOE shall treat all sensitive commercial and financial informationprovided to it by Occidental pursuant to negotiations which were conductedwith respect to this Consent Order as confidential and proprietary andwill not disclose such information unless required to do so by law, includingpursuant to a request duly authorized by a committee or subcommittee ofCongress. If a request or demand for release of any such information ismade pursuant to law, the DOE shall claim any privilege or exemption reasonablyavailable to it. The DOE shall provide Occidental with ten (10) days' actualnotice, if possible, in advance of any pending disclosure of such information,unless prohibited or precluded from doing so by law or request of Congress.The DOE will retain the audit information which it has acquired duringits review of Occidental's compliance with the federal petroleum priceand allocation regulations in accordance with the DOE's established recordsretention procedures. Notwithstanding the confidential treatment that mightotherwise be afforded such information by the terms of this Consent Order,the DOE will make such information available to the Department of Justice(``DOJ'') in response to a request pursuant to the DOJ's statutory authorityby a duly authorized representative of the DOJ. If requested by the DOJ,the DOE shall not disclose that such a request has been made. Nothing inthis paragraph shall be deemed to waive or prejudice any right Occidentalmay have independent of this Consent Order regarding the disclosure ofsensitive commercial and financial information. VII. Contractual Undertaking 701. It is the understanding and express intention of Occidental and theDOE that this Consent Order constitutes a legally enforceable contractualundertaking that is binding on the parties and their successors and assigns.Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Occidental (and its successorsand assigns) and the DOE agree that the sole and exclusive remedy for abreach of this Consent Order shall be the filing of a civil action in anappropriate United States district court, and the DOE also reserves theright to seek appropriate penalties and interest for any failure to complywith the terms of this Consent Order. The DOE will undertake the defenseof the Consent Order, as made effective, in response to any litigationchallenging the Consent Order's validity in which the DOE is named a party.Occidental agrees to cooperate with the DOE in the defense of any suchchallenge. VIII. Final Order 801.
