 My own interestin data transmission began when I attended a conference in Delft, TheNetherlands, in September 1960.andP;  The meeting was organized by the Instituteof Radio Engineers, which was then the leading institute concerned withcomputer hardware.andP;  A few years later it was to join forces with the AmericanInstitute of Electrical Engineers to form the IEEE.andP;  Interest in datatransmission grew rapidly and received a stimulus from the development oftime sharing in 1963.andP;  Since then, there has been steady progress towardsbetter reliability and wider bandwidths.andM;Initially, there were doubts about the adequacy for data transmission ofcontemporary telephone lines.andP;  It was feared the lines would turn out to betoo noisy and too liable to interruption.andP;  At Delft, statistics were quotedfor noise on telephone lines and there was much speculation about its variouscauses.andP;  It was clear that a good deal of the noise was caused by maintenancework being done in cable ducts and elsewhere.andP;  It was noted that the Hawaiicable, which lay undisturbed at the bottom of the ocean, was relativelynoise-free.andP;  One speaker remarked that if only the maintenance workers wouldkeep out of the way, the situation would be improved!andM;However, it soon appeared that early fears about the inadequacy of telephonelines were exaggerated and that, by the use of error control techniques basedon redundancy, even noisy lines were perfectly usable, and could in fact bemade to yield as low an error rate as was necessary.andP;  The effect of noise wasto reduce the rate of transmission, not to make the circuit unusable.andM;Telephone lines have improved over the years, and mechanical switching hasgiven way to electronic switching.andP;  A modern adaptive modem can squeeze agreat deal of bandwidth out of a voice-grade line.andP;  Further improvements maybe expected.andP;  These will be welcome for data, but probably not be noticed byordinary telephone users.andM;For a time, people were generally comfortable with the bandwidth provided bya voice-grade line.andP;  By the late 1960s, however, the need for widerbandwidths was being felt.andP;  The ARPANET used lines having a data rate of 56Kbits/sec.andP;  The demand for higher data rates continued and was more thancould be met.andP;  The result was a bandwidth famine which has continued withsome recent relaxation to the present day.andP;  It has been a true famine in thesense that it has not been possible to acquire enough bandwidth for allpurposes, no matter how much one was prepared to pay.andM;Until the middle 1970s, the computer community was content to use thetelephone company's offerings for local areas as well as for wide areas.andO;Around this time the Ethernet was announced and interest in rings for datacommunication was revived.andP;  From the beginning, both approaches emphasizedwide bandwidths, which were achieved as a natural consequence of usingcomputer engineering techniques in place of telecommunication techniques.andM;The Ethernet created for itself an ecological niche into which it fitperfectly; its advantages and limitations closely matched what the communitycould use.andP;  The contention principle, on which it was based, appealed topeople's imagination and the bandwidth was more than adequate for the time.andO;Limitation to a relatively small geographical area was not seriously felt.andM;The overwhelming attraction of the early Ethernets and rings was theirsimplicity.andP;  They were not networks in the true sense although the term LocalArea Network (LAN) was adopted early.andP;  They were one-level interconnectsystems, with flat addressing and no routing problems.andP;  As soon as Ethernets(or rings) are interconnected to give a genuine network, simplicity vanishesand all, or nearly all, of the problems associated with wide area networkscome rushing in.andP;  This is particularly true if the resulting LAN is multiplyconnected.andP;  Nevertheless, methods of interconnecting Ethernets are available,and while not without problems, are perfectly adequate for present dayrequirements.andM;LANs will inevitably move to wider bandwidths, but it is not entirely clearhow this will happen.andP;  Ethernets have already reached their potential.andP;  Ringsoperating in the range 50-100 Mbits/sec have been in use for some time and astandard (FDDI) exists.andP;  We are beginning to see experimental versions ofrings operating in the gigabit/sec range.andP;  The use of fiber optic cables asthe transmission medium enables rings to cover a wide geographical area--wellbeyond a local area as that term is usually understood.andP;  However, large ringsare unwieldy and packets take a long time to go round.andP;  Rings are perhapsbest adapted for use in a backbone interconnect role.andP;  There is a growinginterest in LANs based on VLSI crosspoint switches.andP;  At one time it hadseemed that VLSI was not well adapted to the fabrication of crosspointswitches, because of the large number of pins required.andP;  This problem is nowin the past and at least one 64 channel crosspoint switch is available.andM;The decision as to what should be centrally located, and what should belocated in the user's office, depends on the speed of the LAN.andP;  Opinion onthis matter has swung from side to side as users have weighed the advantagesof independence against the need to have access to central services.andP;  As LANsmove to higher speeds, it will become possible, if so desired, to separatethe display processing from the display itself, and there will be no need forthe user to have more than the bare display hardware on his desk.andP;  There isan obvious advantage in locating equipment that is noisy, gives off heat andrequires maintenance in a central computer room.andP;  Installing workstations inan office building can lead to expenditure on improved air-conditioning thatcan exceed the cost of the workstations themselves.andM;Long distance data transmission is also getting faster.andP;  This is largely aresult of fiber optic cables coming into use on a wide scale.andP;  The use ofpulse code modulation by the telephone company has made a data rate of 64Kbits/sec the norm for a voice channel, although at present the ordinarysubscriber does not see those bits; what he gets is an analog voice gradeconnection.andP;  Leased circuits of one Mbit/sec are no longer uncommon, and evenhigher bit rates are coming into use.andP;  We may expect dramatic improvement inthe availability and cost of wide bandwidth rented lines as the long hauldata business becomes more competitive.andP;  It is not too much to hope that weare moving away from a famine situation towards something approaching a freemarket situation in which those prepared to pay will be able to get what theyneed.andM;New activities, based on wide-band digital technology, are growing all thetime.andP;  Not all of them make demands on telecommunication bandwidth.andP;  Forexample, we are witnessing the birth of a new industry seeking to exploit theenormous storage capacity of CD-ROMs, a data version of the familiar compactdiscs used for audio recording.andP;  The Oxford English Dictionary has beenavailable in this form for some time, and it has been possible to exploit itsresources in new and imaginative ways.andP;  For example, whereas formerly it wasonly possible to access an entry under its head word, it is now possible tosearch for key words within the entries themselves.andP;  CD-ROMs can also be usedto store digitized video, and before very long it will be possible to buytelevision entertainment in that form.andM;Parallel developments are taking place in computer research laboratories.andP;  Itis not uncommon to see a television image displayed in a window on aworkstation, while other windows display text, graphics, programs, and datain the usual way.andP;  At the present time, the television pictures are usuallyin analog form and are incapable of being manipulated by the processor.andO;However, advanced research is being done with digital representation and thisopens up endless possibilities for the editing and merging of images.andO;Desktop editing of images may become an important computer application in theway desktop publishing has done.andP;  Since the borderline between editing animage for legitimate reasons and editing it for purposes of misrepresentationis not easy to draw, these developments are likely to present judges andlawmakers with some interesting challenges.andM;Coming into use are databases for personnel records in which biographicalsummaries along with a digital photograph can be displayed on a computerterminal.andP;  I recently witnessed one such database with a difference.andP;  Anentry for one of my old friends was turned up and a picture of him wasdisplayed.andP;  I was not particularly impressed, until suddenly the man in thepicture began to move.andP;  The effect on me was electric!andP;  It was no longer justa picture; it was the man himself!andP;  Without seeing this demo, I would nothave believed that motion could add so much value to a photo.andM;We may undoubtedly expect to see, alongside the computer documents that weknow today, a new kind of document in which text, voice, and images will beintegrated.andP;  Images, especially moving images, require a vast number of bits,even if compression techniques are employed.andP;  If the passing of multimediadocuments between one computer site and another becomes a frequent operation,then the load imposed on computer networks will be considerable.andM;It is not yet clear whether the use of multimedia documents will be confinedto certain restricted application areas, or whether their use will becomewidespread.andP;  Progress in other areas is also tending to increase the trafficon computer networks.andP;  There has been a steady growth in the number ofprocessor cycles devoted worldwide to numerical calculation.andP;  The increasinguse of modeling and simulation in engineering and in science contributes tothis trend.andP;  The results of such calculations, often displayed in graphicalform, constitute an increasing amount of the traffic carried by computernetworks.andP;  The growing use of automatic methods for acquiring data issimilarly leading to new traffic.andP;  NASA, working with various other spaceagencies, has announced plans for putting up an Earth Orbiting System (EOS),comprising a group of satellite sensors.andP;  By the mid 1990s these will beginto send an alarming amount of data to the earth every second.andP;  It is likelythat in future advances in telecommunications, the use of optical fibers inparticular, will provide plenty of bandwidth for traditional computernetworking with its emphasis on resource sharing.andP;  The networks we now haveare designed for this sort of traffic, in which the slick handling of shortmessages is of paramount importance.andP;  However, there is likely to be a majorgrowth of bulk data traffic, arising from the activities of thesupercomputing world, from NASA, and from similar sources.andP;  This will beaugmented by document traffic, in which I include reference material andmultimedia documents, although I suspend judgment as to how important thelatter will be.andM;The current computer networks were not designed for document traffic and, ifthis is allowed to flood in, the networks will become useless for theiroriginal purpose.andP;  The solution will be to build, alongside the existingnetworks, new networks optimized for bulk data, not all of which will beclosely related to computers.andP;  Perhaps it is not too much to hope thatoptical fibers will provide enough bandwidth for both types of network,provided that junk data does not grow to major proportions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
