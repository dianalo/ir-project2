He touts as hischief achievement an amendment that would exempt small manufacturers from abill that would make it easier for discounters to sue manufacturers onprice-fixing charges.

Helped preserve program that allows fourSan Jose health clinics to provide subsidized care to low-income seniors.;Impact: Using his chairmanship of a key House subcommittee, the veteranlegislator pared down a Bush administration proposal to curtail the appealrights of death-row inmates, then staved off amendments on the House floor. Inlate November, President Bush promised to veto the entire crime bill becauseit included Edwards' handiwork. Now the issue will return during an electionyear, when Edwards will find it tougher to push an unpopular cause.; Votesmissed: 12 of 444.; Rep. Norman Mineta; D-San Jose; Tenure: 17 years; Majoraccomplishment: Wrote key portions of a $151 billion transportation bill thatshifts emphasis away from interstates and toward mass transit.; Bringing homethe bacon: Obtained more than $500 million for a Santa Clara County light-railspur and a BART extension, and $35 million for a Highways 17-85 interchange.Battled bureaucrats over an extra $25 million for the Guadalupe River floodcontrol project in downtown San Jose.; Impact: After failing in a late 1990bid to head the House Public Works Committee, Mineta managed to play a keyrole in this year's transportation bill. But he and chairman Robert Roe,D-N.J., spent much of their time on a failed effort to raise the gas tax.Their Senate counterparts focused on shifting federal transportation dollarsfrom interstate highways to urban areas -- and won the acclaim when Bush wentalong.; Votes missed: 11 of 444.; Rep. Leon Panetta; D-Monterey; Tenure: 15years; Major accomplishment: Held together bipartisan budget agreement,preventing divisive debate on taxes and social spending.; Bringing home thebacon: Forced deadline on preliminary environmental cleanup studies of FordOrd site. Helped extend oil drilling moratorium off central California coast.;Impact: As chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, Panetta used hisconsiderable muscle to keep a five-year budget agreement intact -- avoiding arepeat of last year's partisan slugfest over taxes and social programs.Panetta also unveiled a 10-year budget plan that calls for defense cuts andnew taxes to help bring down the deficit. He couldn't keep Fort Ord off thePentagon's base closure list, so he pushed through time limits on cleanupstudies.; Votes missed: 6 of 444.; Rep. Pete Stark; D-Hayward; Tenure: 19years; Major accomplishment: Continues building reputation as one of the fewHouse experts on health care issues.; Bringing home the bacon: One, of severalmembers who worked to prevent shutdown of the Alameda Naval Air Station.Successfully pushed for more customs officials at Bay Area airports, includingSan Jose.; Impact: Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the Ways andMeans Committee, used that forum to push health care reform and battle theAmerican Medical Association. With health care becoming a campaign issue,he'll have to fend off other members' agendas while pushing his own. As amember of the Ways and Means Committee, Stark is part of the debate onreducing the tax burden for middle-income Americans.; Votes missed: 39 of444.; Sen. Alan Cranston; D-California; Tenure: 23 years; Majoraccomplishment: Avoided a full Senate censure vote after Keating Fiveinquiry.; Bringing home the bacon: Wrote mass-transit section of thetransportation bill, which could bring California as much as $12.7 billion infederal funds over five years. Successfully lobbied for designation of atleast $10 million for property maintenance at the Presidio in San Francisco.;Impact: Cranston, 77, suffered his most difficult year in the Senate. Heunderwent surgery and radiation treatment for prostate cancer while the Senateethics committee debated his fate for intervening with federal regulators onbehalf of convicted financier Charles H. Keating Jr. Cranston's periodicabsences because of illness, coupled with an ethics investigation that led toa reprimand, stunted his influence. He is expected to spend his final yearlobbying for a bill to protect more than 7 million acres of Californiadesert.; Votes missed: 46 of 280.; Sen. John Seymour; R-California; Tenure: 1year; Major accomplishment: Wrote five amendments to the crime bill, includingtougher drug paraphernalia provisions and a federal study of battered womansyndrome; bill itself did not pass.; Bringing home the bacon: One of severalmembers who worked to prevent shutdown of Alameda Naval Air Station. Obtained$15 million worth of government surplus food for distribution to beleagueredfarmworkers in the Central Valley.; Impact: Seymour has performed capably onparochial issues where his aggressiveness can carry the day. On larger issuessuch as water distribution and desert preservation, he has blocked plans hedislikes but hasn't found politically viable alternatives. That's not unusualfor a member of the minority party, but he could use a major accomplishmentsuch as a desert bill to help his election campaign next year.; Votes missed:12 of 280.;   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;Coming public appearances;   Rep.
