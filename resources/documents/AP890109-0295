This year there are only a few changes _ and most of them arebeneficial.   There's another bit of good news. Because April 15 falls on aSaturday, you have two extra days to file your 1988 return.   Most of the changes enacted by Congress in 1986 were in effectwhen returns were filed last year. Deductions for sales taxes andfor two-earner couples were repealed; the preference for capitalgains was wiped out; Individual Retirement Accounts were limited,and new restrictions were placed on deductions for consumer interestand medical and miscellaneous expenses.   Those changes paid for lower tax rates and for higher exemptionsand standard deductions.   For 1988 returns, exemptions and standard deductions are higherstill, and most people will find their rates have dropped again. Themost significant change that could bring higher taxes for somepeople is a further tightening of the deduction for consumerinterest.   The major changes:   PERSONAL EXEMPTION: You may exempt from taxation $1,950 foryourself, your spouse and each dependent, up from $1,900 last year.A student or other person who can be claimed as an exemption byanother _ such as a parent _ may not take an exemption on his or herown return.   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: A couple that does not itemize deductionsmay reduce income subject to taxation by $5,000; for a singleperson, the deduction is $3,000; for a head of household, $4,400;for a married person filing a separate return, $2,500. In each case,a person over 65 or blind gets a higher deduction; for example, amarried couple over 65 with one spouse blind and filing jointly isallowed $6,800. A person who can be claimed as a dependent isallowed as little as $500, depending on type and size of income.   TAX RATES: Last year, there were five rate brackets, from 11percent to 38{ percent. Now there are four: 15 percent, 28 percent,33 percent, and 28 percent again. For most taxpayers, it makes nodifference how many rates there are, since they still determine howmuch they owe by looking at a tax table. The net result is thatunder the new law, most people will pay a smaller part of theirtaxable income to the government _ although more of their income maybe taxable.   MORTGAGE INTEREST: A homeowner now may deduct interest on up to$1 million of debt used to acquire one or two homes plus up to$100,000 of home-equity loans. There are no restrictions on how theequity loan can be spent.   CONSUMER INTEREST: Only 40 percent of interest paid on loans foreducation, automobiles, credit cards and other personal debt isdeductible on 1988 returns, down from 65 percent the previous year.   INVESTMENT INTEREST: Deductible interest paid to make investmentsis limited to net investment income plus $4,000. Any excess may be``carried over'' into future years and deducted against investmentincome.   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: This benefit for lower-income workingfamilies with dependent children has been increased to a maximum of$874, up from $849. Families with earned income as high as $18,756may qualify, up from $15,432 in 1987.   MUTUAL FUNDS: Publicly offered mutual funds will not reportcertain operating expenses as income to shareholders for 1988 and1989; thus, shareholders will not have to report such amounts asincome or write them off as miscellaneous deductions. This is thesame treatment allowed for 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
