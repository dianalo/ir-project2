The full Senate is expected to confirm Mr. Taylor,currently chief of bank supervision at the Federal ReserveBoard, this week. The 52-year-old Mr. Taylor will succeedWilliam Seidman, whose term ended Wednesday.</LP><TEXT>   When Mr. Taylor reaches the FDIC, he will face two toughproblems. First, FDIC officials are worried that the sloweconomic recovery will provoke a new round of bank failuresand drain the bank deposit insurance fund more quickly thanexpected. If Congress doesn't act soon to adopt a proposal toboost the FDIC's borrowing authority by $70 billion, theagency may have to postpone the closure and sale of failedbanks, Mr. Seidman warned last week.   Second, the agency will have to decide by Nov. 1 whetherto boost the premiums that banks pay to finance depositinsurance. Congressional leaders are calling for an increasefrom the current 23 cents for each $100 of domestic deposits,but many banks warn that the increase will hurt an industrythat's already weak.</TEXT></DOC>
