The procedures followed by theLinn County Board of Health in adopting the revised ordinance satisfiedthe notification and hearing requirements of 40 CFR 51.102. Air pollution control activities in Linn County, Iowa, are the responsibilityof the Linn County Health Department. The Health Department operates theair pollution control program under a letter of agreement with the IDNR.The state retains concurrent authority. This includes prevention of significantdeterioration (PSD) permits; permits pertaining to new source performancestandards (NSPS); and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutantsinsofar as such authority has been delegated to the state. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is processing new source permitapplications for Linn County until EPA approves the county's permit rules.For that reason, Linn County cannot collect new source permit fees. Thestate does not have a permit fee system. Approval of the county permitrules will enable it to comply with the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(K)of the Clean Air Act, as amended. <ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Ordinance Provisions </ITAG>Section 10.1 contains definitions applicable to the air pollution controlordinance. The following discussion pertains to the major items defined.Air pollution means the presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or moreair contaminants in sufficient quantities, and of such characteristicsand duration as is or may reasonably tend to be injurious to human, plant,or animal life, or to property, or which unreasonably interferes with theenjoyment of life and property. This is approvable. The ordinance defines air pollution alert, air pollution emergency, airpollution episode, air pollution forecast, and air pollution warning. Theseterms are used in conjunction with air pollution episode planning whichis required as part of the state plans under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Theterms relate to pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditionsconducive to air stagnation which would contribute to increasing pollutantconcentrations and increasing health risks to the general public. The definitionsused are approvable. The county's definition of emission limitation and emission standard iscompatible with EPA's definition at 40 CFR 51.100(z) and is approvable.Fugitive dust means any airborne solid particulate matter from any sourceother than a flue or stack. This is acceptable. Major stationary sourcemeans any stationary source which emits or has a potential to emit 100tons per year (TPY) of any regulated pollutant, or any physical changethat would by itself constitute a major source. A major source of volatileorganic compounds (VOC) is defined as a major source of ozone. This isapprovable. A major modification is any physical change in the method ofoperation of a major stationary source that would result in a significantnet emissions increase of any regulated contaminant. This definition isconsistent with the EPA regulations. Particulate matter means any materialexcept uncombined water that exists in a finely divided form as a solidor liquid at standard conditions. This definition is acceptable as a definitionof total suspended particulate (TSP) matter; however, this definition shouldbe revised to be consistent with EPA's PM<T2>10</T2> definition at 40 CFR 51.100(oo). The ordinance definition ofsignificant is consistent with EPA's regulations except that it does notcontain an emission rate for PM<T2>10</T2>. This definition should be revised to be completely consistentwith EPA's definition. The stationary source definition is consistent withEPA requirements and is approvable. Section 10.2 of the ordinance establishes the Air Pollution Agency as adivision of the Linn County Health Department. This is approvable. Section 10.3 contains permit requirements for new and modified sourcesand annual operating permits. Section 10.3(2) identifies the basic informationrequired for a permit to install (or construct). A 30-day notice of intentto issue a new source permit is required under the ordinance and providesfor an opportunity for public hearing. This is approvable. Annual operating permit requirements are contained in section 10.3(3).This section provides for annual inspections to assure that a source continuesto operate within the applicable emission rate. EPA is approving the county'soperating permit program with the provision that any permit which changesany requirement of the Iowa SIP, including requirements in any constructionpermit, must be submitted to EPA, and approved, as a SIP revision. Section10.3(4) requires action on a permit application within a reasonable time.Permit denials are provided for in section 10.3(5). Written notice is requiredon denials. Steps needed for application reconsiderations are also outlined.This is approvable. Section 10.3(6) requires posting permits in a prominentlocation near the permitted equipment or device. Section 10.3(7) prohibitsthe transfer of permits. Section 10.3(8) requires the air pollution control officer to certify uponrequest of a permittee that the required control equipment was purchasedand/or installed as required. Section 10.3(9) requires that a permit holder maintain testing facilitiesthat were required by the permit to install or operate.Section 10.3(10) allows exemptions from the installation and operatingpermits. These are generally gas-fired units less than 50 million Btu heatinput; coal-, oil-, or wood-fired units less than one million Btu heatinput; and mobile sources. This is approvable. Section 10.3(11) adopts provisions for emission offsets for nonattainmentareas contained in the state rule 567-22.5(455B) by reference. The state'srule was approved by EPA as part of the Iowa Part D SIP on September 12,1985 (50 FR 37177). This is approvable. Section 10.3(12) adopts the Iowa stack height regulations in State Rule567-23.1(4)(455B) by reference. This is approvable. EPA approved this stateregulation on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41600). Section 10.4 provides for permit fees. Fees are required for new sourceconstruction or modification, as well as annual permit renewals. The permitfee provisions are consistent with the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(K)of the Clean Air Act, as amended. As noted previously, certain definitions should be revised to be consistentwith the PM<T2>10</T2> requirements. The state committed to the revision of the LinnCounty ordinance definitions of particulate matter and significant forconsistency with the definitions promulgated by EPA on July 1, 1987 (52FR 24712). Under terms of the authority granted by the state, the countyair program operates as an agent of the state and enforces state regulations.The state revised its SIP in a manner consistent with EPA's PM<T2>10</T2> promulgation of July 1, 1987. EPA is approving the state'sPM<T2>10</T2> SIP revision elsewhere in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Until the local agency adopts the required PM<T2>10</T2> revisions and those revisions are approved by EPA, the statewill remain responsible for approving permits relating to PM<T2>10</T2> emission sources in Linn County.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ACTION: </T2>EPA approves the permit regulations contained in Chapter10 of the Linn County Ordinance, Air Pollution Control. This includes thepurpose, definitions, and permit requirements. EPA is approving the county'soperating permit program with the provision that any permit which changesany requirement of the Iowa SIP, including requirements in any constructionpermit, must be submitted to EPA, and approved, as a SIP revision. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective October 16, 1989, unless, within 30 daysof its publication, notice is received that someone wishes to make adverseor critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawnand two subsequent notices will be published prior to the effective date.One notice will withdraw final action and another will begin a new rulemakingby announcing a proposal of action and establishing a comment period. Ifno such comments are received, the public is advised that this action willbe effective October 16, 1989. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing orestablishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP.Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately inlight of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and inrelation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.) This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administratorunder the procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables 2 and 3 SIPrevisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of ExecutiveOrder 12291 for a period of two years. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, petitions forjudicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Courtof Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days of the date of publication.This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.(See section 307(b)(2).) <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons, Incorporation byreference, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone,Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and Sulfuroxides.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of Iowa was approved by the Director of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William Rice,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Regional Administrator.</ITAG>40 CFR Part 52 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 52_[AMENDED]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart Q_Iowa </ITAG>1.
