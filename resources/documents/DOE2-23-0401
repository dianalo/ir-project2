From 293 to 20 K, yield strength, tensile strength, and elongationincreased with decreasing temperature. Fracture toughness did not significantlychange. Two vessels of different thickness for containing liquid oxygenwere designed. The manufacturing process included blanking, stretching,machining, welding, heat treatment, nondestructive evaluation, and prooftesting. Proof and fatigue tests and tests to failure of the vesselswere conducted at room temperature and at 153 K. The dependence of rupturestrength on vessel and weld thickness was evaluated and the fracturebehavior was analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
