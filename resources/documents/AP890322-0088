(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sale of PTL's assets is jeopardized byan 8-year-old lawsuit claiming that a vast area of South Carolina isthe historic preserve of the Catawba Indians.   The dispute over 225 square miles, including the cities of RockHill and Fort Mill and highly developed areas outside Charlotte,N.C., has made it difficult for property buyers to obtain titleinsurance to protect their ownership rights.   Among those affected by the Catawbas' claim is Canadianbusinessman Stephen Mernick, whom a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judgeselected in December to buy the land in Fort Mill where Jim Bakkerbuilt his religious television empire.   Mernick assumed joint management of the property with abankruptcy trustee on Feb. 13, but no date has been set to close thesale.   ``As of this point, we have not had a national title insurancecompany willing to commit,'' Glen Hardymon, Mernick's attorney, saidTuesday. But Hardymon added that Mernick is ``not the least bitworried. It can be worked out.''   One option is for the Catawbas to transfer their claim from theland to the proceeds of the sale, said Don Miller, attorney for thetribe.   That option, however, could affect the amount of money from thesale that would be left for PTL creditors, said PTL bankruptcyattorney Brad Leggett.   Bakker, who built the Heritage USA Christian retreat and themepark in Fort Mill, left PTL in a sex and money scandal in 1987. Theevangelical empire entered bankruptcy reorganization three monthslater.   The lawsuit has clouded more than $200 million in real estatetransactions and has harmed economic development in the area,according to the York County Council, Tega Cay City Council and RockHill Area Chamber of Commerce.   The local councils want state and federal authorities tonegotiate a cash or land settlement with the Catawbas.</TEXT></DOC>
