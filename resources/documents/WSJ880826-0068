Although wielding only one of 13 votes in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Saudis can single-handedly balance or unbalance supply with demand in world oil markets.    But soon, the Saudis may be joined at the pinnacle of the world of oil. Peace in the Persian Gulf, if it sticks, may elevate Iraq as the new petroleum powerhouse, keeping a lid on oil prices in the short term and possibly reshaping political alliances in the Arab bloc over the long term.    &quot;The Iraqis are going to emerge as the dominant military power in the Persian Gulf region over time because of the oil wealth they are going to have,&quot; says Charles K. Ebinger, a Mideast expert at International Resources Group, a Washington consulting firm.    The eight-year war of attrition with Iran long put a cap on Iraqi oil production. But with the ink barely dry on the ceasefire accord, which went into effect last Saturday, the Iraqis are resuming plans to exploit reserves that they had just begun to tap when the war erupted. And those reserves appear to be enormous. Even with many oil fields presumably still undiscovered, Iraq now claims recoverable reserves of 100 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia's 169.5 billion barrels and quadruple what remains in the pickedover, rapidly declining U.S.    &quot;Iraq is a boom waiting to happen,&quot; says Frederick Axelgard, an expert on Iraq at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.    After being shut out for years, Western oil men are lining up to help the Iraqi industry grow. &quot;We would love a chance to explore in Iraq again,&quot; says Basil Butler, the managing director for exploration at British Petroleum Co.    The consequences of Iraq's emerging power, though impossible to predict with certainty, are intriguing political and energy experts. Neither Saudi Arabia, with its own oil revenues and its economy weakening, nor any other OPEC member is seriously inclined to curb its own output to make room for all the additional oil Iraq wants to pump. The world oil glut that has kept gasoline prices low and bank-failure rates high will therefore be extended -- perhaps for years but surely for however long it takes for world-wide demand to absorb the new Iraqi production.    Having a lot of oil in the ground diminishes Iraq's own incentive to seek higher oil prices now; less-endowed exporters, such as Nigeria, want to stretch out their smaller reserves and raise prices. But for cash-strapped Iraq, pumping oil hard can make up for low prices. And in peacetime, with shipping channels open and new refineries being built, the country can milk its fields much harder and export oil as both crude and refined products.    Nevertheless, the world oil markets, in the confusion over what peace between Iraq and Iran will bring, have reacted with overwhelming bullishness. The theory is that as the passions of war cool and OPEC becomes more unified, Iraq will rejoin the cartel's production-quota system and reduce its output. Thus, the theory goes, the cartel will regain its grip on oil prices.    But many in the industry, as well as some outside experts, scoff at such forecasts. &quot;I am fascinated, if not astonished, the way the market responded to such a fairy tale,&quot; says Joe Roeber, a London-based energy consultant. And Melvin A. Conant, the editor of Geopolitics of Energy and a Washington-based consultant on Mideast oil affairs, even expects a protracted oil &quot;war&quot; as Iraq, in the wake of the cease-fire, raises production. The financial burdens that the war has left Iraq could give the country more incentive than ever to step up its exports, which currently bring in $1 billion a month.    Iraq is burdened with a staggering $65 billion of debt -- half of which is owed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Arab states that supported it during the war -- and with $8 billion of war damages to its oil facilities alone. In addition, the appalling human cost of the war drained Iraq of many of its young, potentially productive people. So, the country faces a huge rebuilding job with limited resources, and Iraq's dream of becoming an oil Goliath could be thwarted for some time.    Iran, too, remains an obstacle to Iraq's ambitions. The war may not really be over. Further tensions could keep Iraq -- currently, in effect, a landlocked nation -- still blocked from exporting its oil through the Persian Gulf. And even after the fighting ends, Iraq will still have to contend with Iran -- as a formidable competitor in world oil markets, a debt-free country that at one time produced nearly twice as much petroleum as Iraq did.    Under the shah -- before the 1979 revolution -- Iran produced as much as six million barrels a day, while Iraq's prewar output peaked at 3.5 million barrels a day. During the war, production plummeted in both countries. Iraq harassed Iranian tankers, and it itself couldn't ship through the gulf. In addition, Syria, an ally of Iran, closed the Syrian-Iraqi pipeline.    But Iraq is using an expanding network of new pipelines to the Red Sea and the Mediterranean -- as well as trucks -- to edge ahead of Iran on exports. Moreover, Iran's fields are old and on the decline, and they aren't expected to be able to produce more than four million to five million barrels a day in the future. Iraq, in contrast, has new fields to be developed as well as promising areas to explore.    Signals from Baghdad indicate that Iraq wants renewed Western participation in its oil development. Iraq's oil minister recently visited the U.S. to talk to American oil companies. And although foreign companies are prohibited from holding equity interests in Iraqi fields, many are keenly interested in other arrangements.    &quot;There should be a role for Western internationals in Iraq,&quot; says an executive of a major U.S. oil company. Several oil companies, including Mobil Corp. and British Petroleum, already are providing seismic and other technical services to Iraq and confirm that they want to do more.    In one respect, however, the Iraqis need little outside help. Amid the current world oil surplus, they have been among the world's most aggressive oil salesmen, and they are considered to be among the world's best oil traders. They have had plenty of practice.    Seepages of petroleum in the land formerly called Mesopotamia have been known since Biblical days. Oil, in the form of pitch, is said to have been used as a mortar in the Tower of Babel and in the walls of Babylon. Noah is supposed to have caulked the Ark with it.    More than 60 years ago, a well was drilled at Kirkuk, in northern Iraq near the mountainous borders with Iran and Turkey, to try to tap the underground deposit whose seepages fueled the Eternal Fires of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king who conquered Jerusalem. The result was one of the world's great gushers, roaring in at 90,000 barrels a day -- equivalent to nearly four million gallons of gasoline. That well, drilled several years before petroleum was even discovered in Saudi Arabia, helped launch the modern era of Mideast oil.    But despite such historic beginnings, Iraq's petroleum industry languished for years. A succession of unpredictable revolutionary regimes discouraged foreign investment. And friction constantly marred relations between the Iraqis and the initial developers of their oil, a British-French-American consortium called Iraq Petroleum Co. Iraqis still take as an article of faith the notion that the Western companies purposely neglected their oil interests in Iraq to favor new prospects in the Mideast and Latin America.    These resentments partly accounted for the birth of OPEC in 1960 -- and not in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, but in Baghdad, at a meeting called by Iraq. The following year, the Iraqi government seized 99% of Iraq Petroleum's concessions.    From then until the 1970s, when the consortium's remaining facilities were nationalized, not a single exploratory well was drilled in Iraq. After 1979, Iraq became a bit of a political outcast, even in the Arab world. Its hard-line dictator, President Saddam Hussein, bickered with Kuwait over territory, chided the Saudis as &quot;reactionaries&quot; and aligned the Iraqis with radical groups. And only then, when word of Iraq's vast oil resources began to spread, did oil men begin to pay serious attention to it.    Then, under tight restrictions, a few new foreign concerns were invited in to assist the national oil company. Some of them, such as Petrobras of Brazil, found major new fields. French companies have been active, too, and the Soviets helped Iraq develop some southern fields believed to be significant.    But the Iran-Iraq war interrupted these ventures. Some new fields were overrun by Iran's army and later retaken by Iraq.    How much oil does Iraq have today, and how rapidly can it be pumped? The answers will help determine the balance of supply and demand throughout the industry world-wide, as well as the long-term diplomatic and strategic implications of the birth of a new oil power.    Iraq's oil base is unquestionably huge. The existing fields -- and some promising unexplored regions -- reach from the rugged mountains of the north to the dry, dusty plains of the south, near Kuwait, in an oil belt roughly parallel to the Tigris River. Some say the areas may be an extension of the prolific oil formation underlying Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.    However, not even the Iraqis know how much oil they really have. They were just beginning to gauge their potential when the war began, and, until recently, they have released infrequent, conservative estimates. In a major Venezuelan study of world oil prospects some 10 years ago, &quot;Iraq suddenly stood out,&quot; a Venezuelan oil official recalls. &quot;Without a doubt, its potential is incredible.&quot;    More recently, a few years ago, a previously unreported geophysical survey conducted for Iraq by a Soviet team concluded that 14 developed Iraqi fields had total recoverable reserves of 71.83 billion barrels. Moreover, the Soviets also identified 30 undeveloped fields, with 21.83 billion barrels considered recoverable. That calculation put Iraq's recoverable reserves, in 44 then-known fields, at about 93 billion barrels. And last year, a Western oil company is said to have run a statistical study of Iraqi reservoir structures that suggested 100 billion barrels of proven reserves.    That total is, in fact, what Iraq now claims -- a 100-year supply at current production rates. And Issam Abdul Rahim Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, says a further 50 billion barrels of reserves might be added. If it is, Iraq's known reserves would surely trail only Saudi Arabia's.    Only yesterday, in London, the Iraqi ambassador to Britain called these comparisons of reserves only &quot;the published figures.&quot; He added: &quot;There are many areas (in Iraq) not officially tapped.&quot;    Even some Western oil men skeptical of Iraq's official figures concede that Iraq has a lot of undiscovered oil. &quot;If you are talking about elephants&quot; -- giant oil fields&quot;you have to rank Iraq very high,&quot; says a senior official of a major U.S. oil company formerly based in the Mideast. &quot;On a pure exploration play, it has more oil to be discovered than Saudi Arabia.&quot;    Currently, Iraq is producing up to 2.8 million barrels a day. Oil Minister Al-Chalabi puts the country's production capacity at four million barrels a day and says that will be increased by 500,000 barrels with just the fields already under development. In as little as a year, he adds, Iraq could have port and pipeline facilities for exporting as much as seven million barrels a day -- though some experts doubt that that level could be achieved so quickly. The non-Communist world's finely balanced oil markets, currently consuming about 48 million barrels a day, couldn't absorb that much extra oil.    Yet, before the war, Iraq had planned to export that much eventually. At that time, Iraqi officials were determined to match Saudi Arabia's production, then exceeding eight million barrels a day. However, Iraqi officials concede that their targets are lower today.    Mr. Al-Chalabi says Iraq has specific plans to increase its production capacity to about 6.5 million barrels a day. But some of this expansion has been postponed because of weak oil markets and the war. &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he says, &quot;the efforts and investments needed to raise the existing capacity are minimal. . . . Most of the prerequisites had already been carried out.&quot;    ---            The World's Leaders In Oil Reserves    (Estimated proven oil reserves, in billion of barrels)          COUNTRY                      TOTAL      (Top 10 by rank)          (As of January 1988)        1.
