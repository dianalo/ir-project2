McFarlane left congressionalIran-Contra investigators in little doubt last spring that he haddeliberately misled Congress about efforts inside the Reaganadministration to sidestep a ban on aid to Nicaragua's Contrarebels.   Some committee members said at the time they felt the formernational security adviser's under-oath testimony must have beentrue because it was so self-damaging.   McFarlane put the seal on that judgment Friday when he pleadedguilty to four misdemeanor charges accusing him of withholding fromCongress the fact that the administration had helped the Contramovement stay alive, in part through soliciting secretmulti-million dollar contributions from third countries.   By pleading guilty, McFarlane in effect admitted he made falsestatements in letters sent in 1985 to the House Intelligence andForeign Affairs committees and in testimony in December 1986 beforethe Foreign Affairs panel.   In that testimony McFarlane made this statement: ``I did notsolicit any country at any time to make contributions to theContras. I have seen reports that various countries have.''   That was challenged by John Nields, chief counsel of the HouseIran-Contra panel, who referred to the country involved as``Country 2'' although it had been independently identified asSaudi Arabia.   ``Now in fact, you did have a pretty good idea of Country 2'sfunding of the Contras, didn't you?'' Nields asked.   ``Yes,'' McFarlane replied.   Nields: ``In fact, as you've testified yesterday and today, youhad a hand in obtaining contributions totaling approximately $32million from country two?''   McFarlane: ``Yes.''   Nields: ``But you did not tell that to the Foreign AffairsCommittee at that time?''   McFarlane: ``No, I was trying to use some tortured language,inappropriately I think. ... It wasn't a full account. ... Thisisn't as full an account as I could have given.''   Later, he said that testimony and his statements in the 1985letters were ``clearly too categorical on my part.''   In other portions of his Iran-Contra testimony, McFarlane saidhe had helped alter documents, failed to shut down anout-of-control covert operation and did nothing when Marine Lt.Col. Oliver L. North told him he planned to hold a ``shreddingparty.''   McFarlane said repeatedly that if anyone was at fault in all ofthis, it was he.   Summing up, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Housecommittee, rejected McFarlane's attempt to take all of the blame.   ``As the national security adviser you are the spokesman for thepresident of the United States,'' Hamilton told the witness.   ``And when we write to you, we do not write to Mr. McFarlane, wewrite to you as the representative of the president.   ``And when you spoke to the Congress and when you wrote to theCongress, we accepted your words and your assurances as those ofthe president.   ``You spoke for the president,'' Hamilton said. ``And theresponsibility must rest with him, as well as with you. You cannot,it seems to me, accept responsibility for mistakes, as admirable asthat may be, and thereby absolve the president of anyresponsibility.''   ``There is no rebuttal,'' McFarlane replied.   McFarlane, who has testified at length before the grand juryempaneled by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, attemptedsuicide last year by swallowing 30 to 40 Valium tablets one daybefore his scheduled testimony before a presidential commissionthat also investigated the Iran-Contra affair.   Walsh was not permitted to use McFarlane's testimony before theIran-Contra panel as evidence in his case, since McFarlanetestified before the congressional committee under a grant oflimited immunity.   After resigning as national security adviser on Dec. 4, 1985,McFarlane was asked the following May to lead a secret mission toTehran to open contact with so-called moderate Iranians thought tohave influence with Lebanese radicals holding several kidnappedAmericans.   With North as a member of the party, the group traveled aboardan aircraft carrying spare parts for Hawk missiles previouslyshipped to Iran by Israel.   The cake and the Bible signed by President Reagan, whichMcFarlane also carried as gifts, were to become celebrated symbolsof the affair.</TEXT></DOC>
