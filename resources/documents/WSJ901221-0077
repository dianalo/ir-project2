Daimler is scheduled to release its 1990financial results sometime in February.   Mr. Reuter also expects 1991 will be a good year, butdeclined to elaborate. However, he said he is concerned aboutthe strong mark, which has led to currency conversion losseson dollar- and yen-denominated sales, and economic weaknessamong Germany's trading partners.   Germany's economy is expected to grow, but Mr. Reuterwarned of excessive wage demands by workers throughout formerWest Germany.   He said that in the long term, the company might have toswitch some of its production into the &quot;dollar realm&quot; so thatproduction costs and sales are made in the same currency andless revenue is lost in the conversion.   Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H., the German partner in the AirbusIndustrie consortium, is making losses on its airplane sales.The results of Deutsche Airbus aren't factored into theconsolidated group results. Mr. Reuter said that talks willbe held with the German government to discuss the losses. TheGerman government subsidizes currency-related losses onAirbus jets.   Mercedes-Benz AG, the vehicle-making arm of the concern,increased passenger car production by 6% to 572,000 vehiclesthis year. In the U.S., despite economic weakness there, thecompany sold 75,000 cars in the year, an improvement on lastyear. Japanese sales of Mercedes vehicles rose 25% to 40,000.For 1991, about the same production level as 1990 is planned.   At AEG AG, the big electronics subsidiary of Daimler-Benz,1990 sales rose 9% to 13 billion marks in certain key growthareas like electronics, automation and railroad systems.</TEXT></DOC>
