Naturally, there are scientists,legislators, and laymen who view such an action with concern. Among theirconcerns are what the potential danger to human and animal health mightbe. Fortunately, a fair amount is known about the factors that are involvedin microbial pathogenicity. Can we use this knowledge to design geneticallyengineered microorganisms (GEMs) destined for release into the environmentto have a minimal impact on animal or plant health? How can we applythe lessons learned from the study of microbial pathogenicity to theconcerns that have been voiced about the release of GEMs into the environment?One scenario that is often voiced is that some minor genetic change ina nonpathogenic microbe would result in the creation of a new pathogen.Pathogenicity is multigenic and not accidental. In addition, the studyof the ways in which microorganisms bring about disease has led us todesign microorganisms at the genetic level to behave in expected, ratherthan unexpected ways. Understanding biological mechanisms, and manipulatingthem in the most minimal way possible, is the key to reducing any risksassociated with the release into the environment of genetically modifiedorganisms. The release of GEMs is not to be taken lightly, but we neednot unnecessarily fear doing so, either.</TEXT></DOC>
