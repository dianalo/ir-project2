Their testimony will be given at the trial of Mohammed AliHamadi, who is accused of air piracy and murder.   The trial resumes Tuesday after a four-week recess.   Thirty-nine U.S. passengers were held captive for 17 days, and aU.S. Navy diver was killed during the hijacking.   Some passengers were beaten and many said they were tormentedwith death threats after the Athens to Rome flight was commandeeredon June 14, 1985.   Hamadi, who already admitted in court that he was one of thefour men who took part in the hijacking, is expected to testifyTuesday before the judges hear from the two U.S. citizens, whosenames have been withheld.   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Monday the U.S.government was flying the two U.S. witnesses to Frankfurt aboardmilitary aircraft for security reasons.   ``That's why from tomorrow on, security level No. 1 will be inforce at the Rhein-Main Air base,'' the newspaper said. ``The U.S.government is having the witnesses brought to the Hamadi trial withmilitary aircraft.''   Asked about the Bild report, base spokesman Lt. WilliamDillingham told The Associated Press: ``I have not heard anything.''   Security level No. 1 is the highest possible at a U.S. militarybase.   The pilot of flight 847, John Testrake, already has told the APfrom his home in Missouri that he probably will sleep at theRhein-Main base just outside Frankfurt when he comes to Germanylater this month to testify.   ``They will first testify about the identification of thesuspect,'' court spokesman Falk Thomas said of the two Americanwitnesses. ``And they'll also testify about the horribleexperiences during the hijacking.''   The hijackers beat 23-year-old Robert Stethem, a U.S. Navydiver, before he was fatally shot and his body was thrown onto therunway at Beirut airport.   West German officials arrested Hamadi on Jan. 13, 1987 atFrankfurt airport, when customs inspectors found explosives in hisluggage.   His trial began July 5 in a specially built courtroom insideFrankfurt's Preungesheim prison.   He has testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force therelease of Lebenase Shiite Moslems imprisoned in Israel. Shortlyafter the ordeal was over, Israel released about 700 Shiites.   In a surprise move Aug. 9, Hamadi admitted he had taken part inthe TWA hijacking but denied killing Stethem.   Under West German law, the Frankfurt court can convict Hamadi ofmurder even if he did not pull the trigger. Hamadi, who West Germanofficials say is 24 years old, faces a maximum sentence of life inprison.   U.S. officials also have indicted Hamadi on air piracy andmurder charges, but West Germany has refused an extradition requestfrom Washington.   In April, a Duesseldorf court sentenced one of his brothers,Abbas Hamadi, to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two Germanbusinessmen in Beirut in an unsuccesful bid to force West Germanyto free Mohammed from prison.
