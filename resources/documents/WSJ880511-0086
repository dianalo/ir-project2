In March, it also made him managing editor of the morning Clarion Ledger. On the same day, a black became executive editor of Gannett's Lansdale, Pa., daily.    Two decades after the Kerner Commission Report implicated the dearth of black journalists as one cause of the race riots of the 1960s, black and other minority reporters still make up only a tiny percentage of the country's journalists. More than half of the 1,600 or so U.S. dailies have no minority reporters at all.    Gannett, the country's biggest newspaper chain, is an exception. While other papers have tried with little success -- or haven't tried at all -- to hire minorities, Gannett has placed a significant percentage of them in its news rooms and elsewhere in the company. This record is largely the result of an early emphasis on such hiring, formalized and aggressive recruiting and promotion programs, and financial incentives for managers who help meet equal-opportunity goals.    Attention to minority representation, some say, helps in addressing minority issues that many people feel the white-dominated press often ignores. Gannett has been diligent in this regard, too, making sure its papers cover minority issues and tap minority sources for stories.    &quot;They have outpaced&quot; the industry, says Ivan A. Jones, assistant vice president, personnel, at rival Knight-Ridder Inc.    Minorities make up 22% of the U.S. population, but they account for only 7% of the country's 55,300 journalists, up from about 4% in 1978, the year the American Society of Newspaper Editors made its first count. At Gannett's 90 papers, however, one-fifth of all employees are minorities, as are more than 15% of the managers, professionals, technicians and sales personnel. Blacks are managing or executive editors at three Gannett papers and publishers at four others. Two of the eight managing editors at USA Today, the chain's flagship, are black. Only two of Gannett's papers have no minorities.    &quot;If there are six job openings, there is almost no chance they will go to six white males,&quot; says Philip Lerman, a white sports editor at USA Today.    Although Gannett's accomplishments have been hailed widely by both insiders and outsiders, praise hasn't been universal. Some white employees grumble that merit has given way to race in staffing decisions. &quot;There is talk in the bathrooms, in the bars here -- 'Did he get the job because he's black?'&quot; says Mr. Lerman.    At the same time, some blacks say the company still isn't doing enough. And there are also critics who dismiss Gannett's methods as merely an extension of its by-the-numbers management style.    Gannett executives agree that there is more to be done. But they insist that they promote solely because of merit, not race, and deny charges of reverse discrimination. &quot;Until the numbers (of minorities) look dramatically different, I can't find any basis for that kind of talk,&quot; says Madelyn P. Jennings, Gannett's senior vice president, personnel and administration.    Gannett's push toward equal opportunity was begun by Allen Neuharth, the company's chairman. In 1979, he launched a campaign called Partners in Progress, which set a broad agenda for the hiring and promotion of minorities and women. Mr. Neuharth's relentless support of the campaign -- along with the commitment of other top executives -- is a big reason it has worked. John Curley, Gannett's chief executive, notes that when he attends meetings now, he looks around &quot;to see what the mix is and remind managers whether they are making progress or not.&quot;    Another reason for the campaign's success is the way it systematizes minority recruiting efforts, the results of which are evaluated by a peer-review committee of eight to 10 Gannett publishers. A &quot;management-by-objective&quot; manual spells out hiring goals. Managers get equal-employment training in a program called Competitive Edge. Each paper has to report equal-employment figures monthly or quarterly, and gets an annual report card of sorts, grading such things as how hiring goals have been met. Gannett also attends scores of job fairs, advertises in magazines aimed at minorities and often won't fill a job until non-whites apply.    &quot;The question is always, 'Who on the list is a minority or a woman?'&quot; says Alice Bonner, a black who coordinates news-staff recruiting and helps draw minorities to papers in such largely white states as Iowa and Nebraska. &quot;We don't want any of our papers to have all-white staffs.&quot;    But Gannett's most effective tool for encouraging managers to remember equal opportunity is bonuses, says Ms. Jennings, the personnel chief. The extent to which hiring and development goals count in the annual payout varies, she explains. Some managers may already have good records, while others with poorer records might have had few if any job openings to fill.    &quot;You have to look at a bunch of factors to decide what weighting to put on&quot; minority hiring in determining the size of bonuses, Ms. Jennings says. But the linkage is &quot;critical,&quot; she adds, because &quot;when (managers') pocketbooks are involved, things get done.&quot;    Gannett's attitudes are reflected editorially as well. In a practice the chain calls &quot;mainstreaming,&quot; for instance, reporters are required to seek out minorities for comment on a broad range of news stories, including many that aren't strictly about minority issues.    Corporate headquarters monitors the results. In an annual evaluation, each paper sends in samples of how it has included minorities in its coverage. &quot;Editors who decide they are doing a good job because they are covering Martin Luther King's birthday are well off the mark,&quot; says Charles Overby, Gannett's vice president of news. Besides mainstreaming, last year's scoring also addressed how well the news staffs reflected the racial and ethnic makeup of the communities the papers serve and the numbers of minorities hired in the previous 12 months.    An example of how minority hiring has affected coverage is the experience of Norman Lockman, a black reporter Gannett hired away from the Boston Globe four years ago to be managing editor of the Wilmington Morning News. To many blacks in Delaware's largest city, the paper had seemed more interested in the white suburbs than in the black inner city, except for black crime, Mr. Lockman says.    Under Mr. Lockman, the paper has stepped up inner-city coverage, including softer feature pieces he says probably wouldn't have been done in the past. One story, &quot;Reunion of a Corner,&quot; told of several black men, now successful, who reunited to reminisce on the Wilmington corner where they used to hang out.    &quot;What little I knew of Gannett before taking the job was that it was more aggressive at making some efforts&quot; to hire minorities, says Mr. Lockman. Now, he adds, he sees that the chain is interested not only in &quot;bringing people in but (in) bringing them along.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
