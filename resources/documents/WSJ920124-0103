Stephen P. Yokich, UAW vice president and the union's topnegotiator at GM, criticized the auto maker's plan to cutcosts by closing 21 more North American factories andeliminating 74,000 hourly and salaried jobs over the nextthree years.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Yokich sharply criticized GM's labor relations, sayingthe company could save &quot;billions&quot; of dollars by workingtogether with the union on programs ranging from ergonomicsimprovement to halting the outflow of jobs from the company.   But Mr. Yokich effectively denied the No. 1 auto maker'srequest for a major money-saving move. That is a proposalthat UAW workers in GM's 150 U.S. factories take vacation atthe same time in the summer. The move would save GM as muchas $200 million a year.   Mr. Yokich said GM officials would have to gain approvalfor a companywide vacation from workers in each factory, onelocal at a time. Workers aren't likely to accept the changewithout strong support from the union leaders because itwould amount to a $900-a-year pay cut, GM officials concede.Workers wouldn't receive the unemployments benefits they nowdo when plants are closed for normal model changeover.   UAW officials last year also declined the company'srequest to forgo a $600-a-person Christmas bonus last year,which could have saved the auto maker $15 million. Analystsnow expect GM to post a net loss of $2.7 billion for all of1991.   Mr. Yokich said one way GM could improve its results wouldbe to work harder at improving safety in its factories andlowering the stress and strain of various tasks to cuthealth-care costs.   GM officials concede they haven't made as much progress onhealth and safety issues as they would like. But privately,GM officials say the company's fundamental problem is that ithas too many workers, and takes one-third more hours toproduce each car than its best competitors.   GM officials also believe Mr. Yokich was speaking as muchto the union rank and file as to the company. Mr. Yokich, UAWPresident Owen Bieber and all of the union's other topleaders are up for election this year in voting that willtake place in the spring.</TEXT></DOC>
