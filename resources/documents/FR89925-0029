The most significant change isthat certain Regional Divisions and Offices, which formerly reported tothe Regional Director, are now under ``straight line'' authority, meaningthat these units within each Regional Office report to the appropriateAssociate Administrator (or Chief Counsel) in charge of the function performedby that unit.Within part 11 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), various elementsof the FAA have been delegated rulemaking authority by the Administrator.These delegations need to be updated. In addition, throughout the FederalAviation regulations references are made to offices that have been renamedor are no longer in existence as a result of reorganization.Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations must therefore be amended toreflect the reorganizations and changes that have taken place.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The paperwork requirements in sections being amended by this document havealready been approved. There will be no increase or decrease in paperworkrequirements as a result of these amendments, since the changes are completelyeditorial in nature.<ITAG tagnum="84">Good Cause Justification for Immediate Adoption</ITAG>This amendment is needed to avoid possible confusion about the FAA reorganizationand to hasten the effective implementation of the reorganization.In view of the need to expedite these changes, and because the amendmentis editorial in nature and would impose no additional burden on the public,I find that notice and opportunity for public comment before adopting thisamendment is unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the National government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>The FAA has determined that this document involves an amendment that imposesno additional burden on any person. Accordingly, it has been determinedthat: The action does not involve a major rule under Executive Order 12291;it is not significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and because it is of editorial nature, noimpact is expected to result and a full regulatory evaluation is not required.In addition, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>14 CFR Part
