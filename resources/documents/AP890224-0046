He said he left home after being arrested andbeaten for marching against Nicaragua's Sandinista government.   ``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but forpolitical reasons and I think they will come if I tell them thateven if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' hesaid.   But for now, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's toughnew asylum policy has achieved its goal: a sharply reduced flow ofCentral Americans across the Texas border. Patrol officers all alongthe border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase inillegal immigration, despite rumors that immigrants were shiftingtheir point of entry westward to Laredo and El Paso.   ``We're keeping an eye on the situation,'' said Jaime Arras ofthe U.S. Border Patrol Office in El Paso.   Border Patrol officers in Laredo also said they had seen nounusual activity.   But many Central Americans are presumed to be in Mexico, waitingtheir turn to make it past Border Patrol checkpoints and to theirdestinations in the interior.   ``They are not stupid. They're lying low,'' said Silvestre Reyes,Border Patrol chief for the McAllen sector. ``They're probably witha sympathizer, on their own or with an alien smuggler in hs through theRio Grande Valley aroundBrownsville, including 40,000 who have sought political asylum.   To control that flow, an army of INS workers and additionalborder patrol officers descended on the Texas border this week tocarry out the tougher rules for asylum-seekers.   At the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, where an influx ofasylum applicants was expected, giant tents were pitched to housedetainees and dozens of typewriters were shipped to processapplications. So far, none of the tents and few of the typewritershave been needed.   INS officers processed 233 applications for asylum on Tuesday,the first day of the new policy, but just 51 on Wednesday and 10 onThursday. Only two of the more than 300 applicants were grantedasylum.   ``Nobody is coming to apply for asylum and that's sort ofpredictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jailhere, so obviously people are going underground and they are notgoing to be going through the system anymore, which is a tragedy,''said Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based ProyectoLibertad, which represents Central Americans.   Under the old INS procedures, immigrants applying for asylum hadto wait weeks while their applications were processed, during whichthey were released on their own recognizance.   Under the new policy, applications are processed on the spot butthose whose applications are denied are being held on bonds between$1,000 and $4,000. They are housed at an indoor detention center atPort Isabel, 15 miles northeast of Brownsville, or at a Red Crossshelter near the Texas-Mexico border.   Thursday night, more than 400 people stayed at the shelter, only130 of whom were sent by the INS. The others showed up on their ownto await processing of their applications, according to Jim Buck,deputy commissioner of the INS.   Buck said immigration agents are posted at the shelter but not inan adversarial role.   ``We want these people to have a place to stay. We don't wantthem out in the streets,'' he said. ``We will have daily roll call,but we won't have any ... heavy armaments and they'll have freemovement.''</TEXT></DOC>
