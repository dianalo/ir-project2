The technique's usefulnessis enhanced by a novel computer program for optimizing clean coal samplingfrequency. This program analyzes a plant's current sampling scheme, modelsalternatives, and compares results. The user is presented a menu of feasiblesampling schemes which can improve plant economics significantly. Adoptionof these improved sampling programs provides the plant operator witha clearer view of the cleaning potential of the plant, permitting tighterquality control of clean coal output. 14 refs., 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
