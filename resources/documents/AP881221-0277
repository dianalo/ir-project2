The refinery sale, which includes $30 million in working capital,is part of a $7.3 billion divestiture designed to pay for Tenneco'srepurchase of 20.9 million shares of its stock and pay down thecompany's outstanding debt.   Net proceeds from all oil company sales after taxes and expensesare expected to total $6.4 billion, Tenneco said.   ``When we announced the sale in October, we had expected to closeall the parts of the total package by the end of the year, and wehave accomplished that goal,'' said Tenneco spokeswoman M.A. Shute.``The overall sale has gone well and according to expectations.''   Tenneco, a diversified corporation with major interests innatural gas pipelines, farm and construction equipment, automotiveparts and chemicals, was the nation's 10th largest oil company whenit announced the results of bidding two months ago.   The success of that sale at a time the industry is sufferingdepressed oil prices surprised many analysts, who had predicted theholdings would fetch between $5 billion and $7 billion.   Analysts said the ability to package the oil company holdingsapparently helped boost the price for Tenneco, which had about $8.5billion in outstanding debt when it announced the sale.   Other companies that have bought chunks of Tenneco Oil includedChevron Corp., which purchased Tenneco's Gulf of Mexico oil andnatural gas reserves, production facilities and lease interests fornearly $2.6 billion.   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited Partnership boughtthe mid-continent division oil and gas subsidiary for $715 millioncash.   Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd., part of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group,bought Tenneco's Colombian operations for $500 million, and BritishGas PLC spent $194.5 million on a variety of Tenneco's internationaloil and gas interests.   In a separate move, Tenneco has put its 1,900-mile LouisianaIntrastate Gas Corp. pipeline and related facilities up for sale.Ms. Shute said Wednesday that sale is pending.   The pipeline was purchased from Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. for$456 million in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
