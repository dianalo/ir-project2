The Soviets liked Japanese technology even more. On most days, they presented lists of items they wanted to buy. Often mixed in with the mundane construction cranes and squid catchers on those lists were items that the Japanese businessmen suspected might be illegal to export, such as scientific testing equipment, high-tech composite fibers, even armored vehicles.    So, one day in late autumn of 1980, when a Soviet official asked Wako Koeki to find a sophisticated robotized milling machine capable of making large ship propellers, Mr. Kumagai and his bosses didn't think it unusual. Despite their suspicions, Wako Koeki went ahead and, along with C. Itoh andamp; Co., a giant Japanese trading house, helped Toshiba Machine Co. sell milling machines that, the U.S. believes, the Soviets used to make their submarines quieter and thus harder to track.    &quot;Sometimes we had to break the regulations,&quot; says Mr. Kumagai, who, five years later, quit Wako Koeki in a tiff with his boss and informed authorities of the transaction. His revelations have ignited intense anger in the U.S. and gut-wrenching apologies and soul-searching in Japan. They may temporarily dry up trade with the Communist bloc but also may force Japanese companies to think twice about putting sales ahead of national security.    Although the Japanese government's laxity in policing Communist-bloc trade played a major role in the scandal, the Japanese companies' tendency to ignore security issues in the pursuit of deal-making is as much, if not more, to blame. &quot;Japanese have considered it a taboo since World War II to think about national defense and have grown accustomed to thinking that the U.S. will defend the country,&quot; a Foreign Ministry official explains. &quot;National security simply is never thought about by businessmen.&quot;    Indeed, the reasons Wako Koeki pursued the sale tell a lot about why the Soviets seem to score such coups in Japan.    &quot;It was as if they dangled a delicious fruit in front of a hungry man,&quot; says Mr. Kumagai in Russian-accented English. &quot;My company demanded results. I have a conscience, but I also have a family on my shoulder.    &quot;Other companies were under the same pressures. Others were doing that, too,&quot; adds the unemployed 51-year-old, who learned Russian in college and then spent almost 22 years handling Soviet trade and pinning his hopes for advancement on Soviet largess. &quot;Toshiba is only the tip of the iceberg.&quot;    U.S. authorities, and a growing number of Japanese investigators, suspect that Mr. Kumagai is right. The whistle-blower has told police of other incidents, although he concedes that he has little evidence because he didn't save documents. And in many cases, Japan's three-year statute of limitations has expired.    However, a U.S official says that in the past year, the Americans have gone to Japanese authorities with as many as half a dozen cases of export violations by Japanese companies. One, the official adds, is &quot;almost as significant as Toshiba.&quot; In Washington, rumors are circulating that five giant Japanese companies are thought to have violated the rules in the past.    The Japanese government denies that the problem is that big, but, when pushed, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry admits to cracking down on two export violations in May, after the Toshiba case broke. In addition, Japanese police have expelled Poles suspected of stealing computer software secrets and have linked Soviet trade officials with illegal sales of aircraft-instrument technology.    The Japanese government, which at first sent out a hodgepodge of statements waffling on the importance of the Toshiba case to national security, now is closer to speaking with one voice. It is beefing up the staff that scrutinizes export licenses, although the staff remains small by U.S. standards and still isn't expected to pursue rigorously diversions of technology to third countries. And Japan is considering proposed legislation that would increase the maximum fines and prison terms for people convicted of exporting restricted technology to the Soviet bloc.    Japanese companies also are reacting to the scandal involving Toshiba Machine, which is 50.1%-owned by Toshiba Corp. They are more cautious about exports to the Soviet Union, which in the first five months of 1986 had already dropped 67% from a year before. Matsushita Electric Trading Co. says three deals that it had been negotiating with the Soviet Union have been suspended. Japan's beleaguered machine-tool makers say exports to the Communist bloc could slump as much as 70% this year.    However, the Soviets deny being worried about any trade slowdown. &quot;I don't believe this incident will have a great effect on Soviet trade,&quot; says Yurii P. Tchegodar, the director of the economic department of the U.S.S.R. trade office. What can't be bought in Japan, &quot;we will buy from West Germany, England, Italy or the U.S.,&quot; he says, adding, in regard to one of the deals canceled by Matsushita, &quot;We bought it from France already.&quot;    Perhaps more worrisome to the Soviets in the long term is that company attitudes seem to be slowly changing here, toward a broader view of the world. &quot;We Japanese who put our companies' fortunes in front of our country's are beginning to realize that the security of our nation is the security of our company,&quot; says an executive of a major machine-tool maker.    The shift apparently isn't entirely for altruistic reasons. Many fear that the backlash will hurt their business with the U.S. Toshiba faces the threat of tough sanctions prescribed by Congress with only a few dissenting votes. An amendment to the Senate trade bill would give President Reagan the option of banning imports from Toshiba or any of its subsidiaries for as long as five years if he deems such punishment suitable. The House has voted to ban the sale of all Toshiba products at U.S. military stores all over the world.    &quot;Companies can't risk losing 100 yen for one additional yen,&quot; Mr. Kumagai says.    Japan's trade with Communist nations isn't large compared with its trade with the West. Exports to the Communist bloc, including China, totaled about $16.5 billion last year, about 7% of Japan's total exports. The outlook for growth looks pallid, although Japanese executives continue to harbor high hopes for China. The problem is that the Communist bloc is short of foreign currency, and the Soviets, especially, don't want a trade deficit with Japan; thus, trade is choked back because they have few goods that Japan needs.    The Soviets say their imports from Japan are down only 25%, mainly because they are buying less steel pipe and because two major trade agreements have lapsed and are being negotiated. The Toshiba case appears to have little bearing on the negotiations, say some parties involved.    Nor is it straining Soviet-Japanese relations, which seem to be warming up. Last January, Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone invited Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, for a visit, and although the invitation was turned down then, talk of a visit has recently revived. Meanwhile, Soviet proposals to reduce nuclear missiles have been warmly received in Japan. The only nettlesome issues are, for the Japanese, the Soviet refusal to return several northern islands that the Soviets seized from Japan at the end of World War II and, for the Soviets, Japan's attempts to improve relations with China.    There aren't any trade disputes. That's because much of what Japan sells the Soviets is dull fare-steel pipe, drilling equipment, bulldozers and dump trucks for construction and mining. But a partial list of legal exports last year also includes scientific testing equipment, super-cooling devices and even noise-measuring gear along with the machine tools.    &quot;There will be a lot more&quot; crackdowns on Communist-bloc trade, says a U.S. official in Tokyo. &quot;The Japanese now know they have been too lax.&quot;    Soviet trade officials in Tokyo, who refer to the Toshiba case as the &quot;notorious incident,&quot; say they think that they are being made scapegoats in an economic war being waged by the U.S. to weaken Japan's economy. And they make no apologies for seeking high technology in Japan.    Even news reporters from Communist countries keep an eye on high-tech. Whenever the Japanese government press center organizes a tour of a high-tech factory or research facility, the reserved spots are quickly snatched up by Communist-bloc reporters.    &quot;Naturally, every country is interested in modern equipment. We don't buy machines that are no good,&quot; Mr. Tchegodar says.    The Soviets scoff at Japanese and American allegations that many Soviet trade officials in Japan work for the Soviet secret police. Mr. Tchegodar says sardonically that trade officials don't know what is on the Cocom list, the agreement between Japan and several Western nations that restricts high-tech exports to Communist countries. &quot;That is not our function. We are free to ask for everything,&quot; Mr. Tchegodar says. A. Rodionov, another Soviet official, says, shrugging his shoulders, &quot;If the Japanese companies want to send us such things. . . . &quot;    Little distinction is drawn between commercial andmilitary applications. &quot;I believe all machinery can be usedfor military use,&quot; Mr. Tchegodar explains.   Few manufacturers want to talk about their trade with Communist nations. No trading house would agree to an interview, not even the giants whose Soviet trade accounts for less than 1% of their revenues. And an organization of 150 companies that deal with the Soviet bloc refuses to disclose its membership. &quot;There are no Japanese stupid enough to take the trouble to speak out at a time like this,&quot; says an official of the small Kurimoto Trading Co.    But some manufacturers did say it is hard to pass up Soviet orders. The National Policy Agency, Japan's Federal Bureau of Investigation, says the Soviets paid triple Toshiba's list price for the propeller-milling machine.    Even when the Soviets aren't raising the price to get what they want, the trade looks good. The Japanese companies don't have to set up service networks, as they do in the U.S. and Europe. Sales costs are low because few companies need to have large staffs in Moscow. The Soviets know what they want and when they want it. Japanese find the 74 Soviet trade people here easy to deal with because almost all of them, unlike Americans and Europeans, are fluent in Japanese, and most know English, too. And payment is guaranteed.    &quot;There is a lot of profit&quot; in Soviet sales, says Masaya Tsuchiya, an expert on Soviet-bloc trade with the Japan External Trade Organization.    So, while the high yen and trade friction are impeding trade with the West, Japanese companies, especially in declining industries such as shipbuilding, steel and machine tools, find that market appealing. Mr. Kumagai, the Wako Koeki whistleblower, says the Soviets have exploited that by offering lucrative deals to small, weak trading concerns only if they helped them with more difficult projects.    The toughest problems are posed by legal commercial goods that the Soviets divert for military use. In such cases, the companies are supposed to police themselves. But there are a lot of diversions.    Japanese press reports say the Soviets used special ball bearings in the Toshiba-milled propellers. And Toshiba Machine has admitted that it sold two other propeller-milling units to the Soviet Union as early as 1974, but it says these didn't violate existing Cocom laws. MITI acknowledges that it is investigating the sales.    In addition, Nissan Diesel Motor Co., an affiliate of Nissan Motor Co., stopped shipments of flatbed trucks to North Korea after reports that the trucks were being converted to mobile missile launchers. According to other reports, Japanese room air conditioners are being used in Soviet tanks, automobile air conditioners are going into military vehicles, and computer chips purchased in Tokyo's Akihabara electronics district are being carried to the Soviet Union.    Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. had a bad experience with a major diversion some years ago, and the huge shipbuilder and industrial-products company has changed its attitude toward Soviet trade. In 1978, it sold the Soviet Union a dry dock, a gigantic floating repair yard capable of lifting 80,000-ton ships out of the water. No one at the company heard anything about it for several years. Then, a U.S. spy photo spotted it repairing an aircraft carrier.    &quot;We were shocked,&quot; says Koki Kinoshita, an IHI spokesman. &quot;We had dealt with the Soviets for 30 years. We thought the dry dock was another routine matter.&quot;    Although IHI hadn't broken any laws, the incident touched off an internal debate on how to deal with the Soviets. The company decided to keep trading with them -- it still sends them ships and other products -- but every sale is considered in light of alternative uses of the product. &quot;Anything can happen when you deal with the U.S.S.R.,&quot; Mr. Kinoshita says.    And when the U.S.S.R. asked for a second dry dock, IHI politely said it was too busy. An order for computer controls for an aluminum-rolling machine in Hungary also was turned down, but IHI later learned that the Hungarians managed to get the system elsewhere.    &quot;Our company now considers the broad principles of Cocom rather than narrow particulars&quot; of the trade-regulating agreement. &quot;You can be free from legal restrictions but still have moral responsibilities,&quot; Mr. Kinoshita says, adding: &quot;Perhaps you need a bad experience, but now we think we have more self-control.&quot;    ---              Composition of Japanese Exports                To the Soviet Union in 1986                 (In thousands of dollars)  Light industrial products   (including textiles)                   $225,144  Chemicals                                299,066  Steel                                  1,142,584  Other metal products                      81,859  General machinery   (including machinery for   engines, textiles, construction,   mining, heating, cooling and tools)     834,475  Electric machinery   (including machinery for   electric, electric curcuit,   telecommunication, TV and radio   receivers)                              192,174  Transportation machinery   (including rolling stock parts,   trucks, cranes, auto parts and ships)   257,349  Precision machines   (cameras, etc.)                          32,745  Other exports                            154,151  TOTAL                                 $3,149,547</TEXT></DOC>
