Many analysts already were nervous about the fast-growingThai economy, amid speculation-driven stock and propertymarkets, higher inflation and heavy dependence on foreigncapital.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the military revolt that ousted the government ofPrime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan has added furtherquestion marks.   Although the 34-member cabinet named Wednesday is composedlargely of well-respected technocrats and bureaucrats --fulfilling the military's promise to name acivilian-dominated government -- shaky global and domesticenvironments will make it difficult for even the bestmanagers to bring about a soft landing for the still-boomingeconomy.   &quot;I'm deeply fearful for Thailand, but that's only becausethey've been so successful&quot; at encouraging growth in thepast, said one London-based economic analyst. &quot;Thailand hasbeen growing above sustainable levels for the past fouryears, and that can't go on without tearing the economicfabric of the country.&quot;   Economists' worries about Thailand's pattern of growth aremany and varied. Growth estimates for 1991 range between 5.5%and 9%. But analysts see potential problems that plannersmust tackle to avoid repercussions in coming years.   Thailand has had the world's fastest-growing economy since1987, with gross domestic product (output of goods andservices, less foreign income) expanding an average of nearly11.5% a year. Increasingly, that growth has been financed byforeign capital, making economic activity more vulnerable toforeign sentiment.   &quot;Banks continue to be comfortable with their exposure toThailand, but they were already becoming increasinglyobjective in the credits that they were extending,&quot; saidRobert Wallace, manager of Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.in Thailand. &quot;Thailand's not quite the flavor of the month itused to be.&quot;   Whatever the ultimate reaction of foreigners, strains inthe economy had already begun to appear last year. Thailand'scurrent-account deficit in 1990 widened to 156 billion baht($6.23 billion) from 65.6 billion baht in 1989. The 1990figure represented 7.5% of GDP, the highest level in adecade.   Export growth dropped markedly during the year, largelybecause of sluggish agricultural sales. Imports, mainly ofcapital goods and oil, fell only slightly. And lowerremittances from workers in the Middle East, who weredisplaced by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, helped widen thedeficit.   At the same time, inflation was picking up. Officials atthe Bank of Thailand, worried that the economy wasoverheating, finally overcame political opposition and beganto tighten monetary policy.   However, higher interest rates brought mixed results. InDecember, consumer prices rose 6.7% from a year earlier,while prices of industrial products increased by a muchgreater 13.4%. The inflow of foreign capital continued.Domestic demand also remained strong, and tariff cutsbolstered imports. By year's end, bank lending had ballooned33% from a year earlier, while the money supply had grown29%.   The economy received an unwelcome shock early this yearwhen tourism, the country's chief foreign-exchange earner,plummeted. U.S. warnings in January that Bangkok could be anarena for terrorist action virtually emptied hotels. Thatmonth alone, tour-group arrivals slumped 28% from a yearearlier, and more than 80% of lucrative incentive-travelgroups scheduled for the month ended up canceling, accordingto Roberto S. Jotikasthira, president of the Association ofThai Travel Agents.   In addition, as the extent of the worldwide credit crunchand slowdown in economic growth became evident, prospects forexports this year also grew bleak.   Now, with the Gulf war over, many in Thailand nourishhopes that oil prices will fall, tourists will return, riceexports to the Middle East will pick up and Thai workers willreturn to Kuwait and Iraq.   However, the war-related uncertainties have largely beenreplaced by new ones in the wake of the military coup.</TEXT></DOC>
