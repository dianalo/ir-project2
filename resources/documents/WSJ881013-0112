Mr. Iorio, a 47-year-old worker in a factory that makes torpedoes and airplane parts, was able to buy a house during the Reagan years. &quot;Ordinarily, I'd vote for a Democrat,&quot; says Mr. Iorio, a former shop steward for the aircraft workers' union. &quot;But the economy is making me think about voting for George Bush.&quot;    That same economy, however, is making Mrs. Laffey move toward Mr. Dukakis. She says that her husband, an electrician, &quot;has been out of work on and off, and I think Dukakis might be better for the economy.&quot;    Workers in the plants that make machinery, autos and aircraft in this city of brick bungalows are a critical prize in the final weeks of the campaign. As the election nears, they are struggling with the tug of their Democratic traditions and the allure of the Republican recovery.    The challenge in this region is considerably easier for Vice President Bush. He probably can win the election if he does no better than split the six states of the industrial heartland, which stretches from Pennsylvania to Missouri and accounts for 115 electoral votes. Gov. Dukakis has almost no room for error: He must sweep this region, except for Indiana, which may be the only place where Dan Quayle, who represents the state in the Senate, is an asset to the GOP ticket.    As of today, Mr. Bush is in a position to carry the South and most of the Border States, the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountain West, along with a handful of other dependable GOP redoubts -- enough, in other words, to give him about 230 electoral votes. By picking up several smaller states and one or two of the industrial-heartland states, Mr. Bush can reach the 270 electoral votes needed for victory.    Polls throughout the region suggest a very close contest. The Bush-Quayle ticket is well ahead in Indiana but holds a tenuous lead in Missouri and Ohio and is engaged in seesaw battles in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Michigan. Democrats, however, know that they must do better than a dead heat.    Moreover, Mr. Dukakis is fighting historical trends. The Democrats have lost Illinois and Indiana in each of the past five elections and have prevailed in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio just once in two decades.    The Republicans' appeal in the industrial belt is understandable. Average income increased here faster than across the country during the Reagan years and new businesses have sprouted.    The decline in unemployment is particularly striking. In Ohio, the jobless rate last month was 5.8%, compared with 10.4% when the GOP took office in January 1981. In Pennsylvania, the rate has fallen to 5.4% from 9.1%. Even in Michigan, where the rate is 7.3% -- well above the national average -- it is still little more than half its January 1981 level.    &quot;Dukakis is running against peace and prosperity,&quot; says Joseph Schlesinger, a political scientist at Michigan State University. &quot;All year long, people have said they want change, but in the end, even the blue-collar workers who mistrust Bush may be uneasy about change.&quot;    Thus, the difficult Dukakis task over the next four weeks is to erode the Bush argument that those workers never had it so good. Last week, Mr. Dukakis went to Detroit to try to undermine that notion, warning workers that their children may be &quot;unable to enjoy the same standard of living as their parents.&quot;    Democrats think they can capitalize on the distress still felt in the region. The Northeast/Midwest Coalition, a bipartisan congressional group, estimates that 1.8 million people left the industrial belt in the Reagan years. In Missouri, according to the group's figures, average income slipped from $623 less than the national average to $803 less.    &quot;Dukakis has the right message for the Midwest,&quot; says Missouri state Democratic chairman Karen Schafer. &quot;We've got to do a better job of getting it out. It isn't too late.&quot;    Euclid illustrates the difficulty of that task. On paper, the Democrats ought to have enormous appeal here, where a large factory that manufactured copying and paper-handling machines was bulldozed and replaced with a 24-hour discount store. The big Chase Brass andamp; Copper plant was sold to its employees. Many of the city's older residents -- hyphenated Americans whose ancestors came from Poland, Italy, Slovenia, Lithuania, Greece -- remember picking coal off the railroad tracks during the Depression in order to heat their homes. &quot;There are no yuppies in Euclid,&quot; says Democrat Dennis Eckart, who grew up here and now represents a neighboring area in the House of Representatives.    Democrats such as Gary Higgins, who runs a structural-engineering office here, associate an improvement in their lives with the Reagan years. Mr. Higgins says he's for Mr. Bush because &quot;I like the way things are going -- and the alternative is a bleeding-heart liberal.&quot;    But others, including John Faber, a 35-year-old cook, worry that the GOP ticket &quot;doesn't seem to see that poverty . . . is rampant.&quot;    Dukakis strategists also are banking on the growing unease about GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, which they say may undermine Mr. Bush's support in every Midwestern industrial state save Indiana. &quot;I wanted to vote for Bush, but after the debate, Quayle really worries me,&quot; says Mary Yanchar, who sells Avon products and considers herself a Democrat.    The Dukakis economic appeal resonates elsewhere in the region as well. &quot;There isn't one of us that I work with who isn't making less than we made in 1980,&quot; says Shannon Duffy, a baggage handler at the St. Louis airport. &quot;How can we vote Republican? Our people are going to hit the 'donkey' big on Election Day.&quot; Mark Franciscovich, a steam fitter in Peoria, Ill., says he favors Dukakis because &quot;I'm trying to keep my wage established where it is and my pension strong.&quot;    So far, though, Democratic politicians acknowledge that Mr. Dukakis's warnings haven't moved waves of voters into his camp.    &quot;A lot of people now are complacent,&quot; says Anthony Guinta, a Democrat who was Euclid's mayor for eight years. &quot;They're sitting at home being told how good they've got it. Where are the Dukakis people {to tell} us that things aren't so great?&quot;    At the same time, Democratic leaders throughout the region are disappointed in the Dukakis campaign for its failure to shore up its electoral base, to strike back at Mr. Bush's attacks and to develop a compelling case for the Democrats. &quot;It's not a lack of position papers,&quot; says Sharon Carpenter, the recorder of deeds in St. Louis and the chairman of the city's Democratic committee. &quot;It's a lack of passion.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has succeeded in raising doubts about Mr. Bush and the future of Social Security benefits. &quot;I'm worried Bush is going to play around with Social Security,&quot; Louis Luzar, an unemployed factory worker in Euclid, says amid the baskets of hard-boiled eggs and the posters for the Klub Drustev Sweet Heart Ball in the basement of the Euclid Slovenian Society.    But Democratic leaders are distressed that the Dukakis campaign has let the GOP define the Massachusetts governor for voters such as Kellie Ray, who is about to get married and buy a home. &quot;Dukakis worries me,&quot; says the 25-year-old bartender. &quot;He reminds me a little bit of a soft heart, and I don't want the economy to get any worse or taxes to go up.&quot;    Such negative sentiments trouble Democratic insiders, eager to break the current GOP hold on the White House. &quot;It's the Democrats' race to lose, and they're working on losing it,&quot; says Robert Kelley, the president of the St. Louis Labor Council and a member of the Democratic National Committee. &quot;Bush's people are zealots -- they're pro-guns or pro-life or pro-something -- and ours aren't as enthusiastic. Apathy is Bush's friend, and Dukakis is determined to create it.&quot;    The advantage for Mr. Bush is that the economic card Mr. Dukakis counted on playing in the industrial belt so far has helped the Republicans, not the Democrats. &quot;This is blue-collar America, and we're sold on the Reagan policies,&quot; says David Lynch, Euclid's Republican mayor.    The Democrats believe the tide still can turn. Edward Eckart, a city councilman for 18 years, insists Mr. Dukakis can make a comeback if he manages to convince the public that he would help revive the region's manufacturing base and make jobs more secure.    But the GOP has begun an offensive to win the blue-collar voters Mr. Dukakis needs if he is to keep his election prospects alive.    In Missouri, state party leaders are actively courting Democrats who voted for Mr. Reagan. &quot;I think we'll keep most of the Reagan Democrats,&quot; says Sissy Chamberlain, Mr. Bush's St. Louis-area director. &quot;There's unrest, but we're not going to lose them to Dukakis.&quot;    The Missouri GOP has used computers to identify 557,000 swing voters and is sending them special mailings characterizing Mr. Dukakis's views: &quot;These aren't the values of Missouri and Missourians. They're the values of a Northeastern Liberal. Are they the values you want in our next president?&quot;    Here in Ohio, some Democrats worry that Mr. Bush's dismissal of his opponent as a Massachusetts liberal may drown out the Democrat's message on the economy. &quot;We've got a situation here,&quot; says Oliver Henkel, a Cleveland lawyer who ran Gary Hart's 1984 presidential campaign, &quot;where a lot of people are going to vote for the most liberal senator in the universe -- Howard Metzenbaum -- and then for George Bush.&quot;    Democrats hope that tonight's debate in Los Angeles and a late Midwestern offensive will put new emphasis on economic issues and bring more voters under the Dukakis umbrella in places like Euclid.    The Dukakis campaign knows, as Democratic Rep. Edward Feighan puts it, that Euclid is &quot;a Democratic town that finds a lot of appeal in the Reagan message.&quot; Still, in the final weeks of the campaign, the Dukakis people are hoping that Mr. Feighan is right about this, too: Euclid voters might &quot;like the Republicans on social questions-but on hard-core economic issues, they're hard-core Democrats.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
