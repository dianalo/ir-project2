The 32-year-old lawyer said she would go back to Colombia nextweek after concluding discussions with the Bush administration abouther request for additional aid.   ``I am determined that the integrity of our justice systemsurvives this crisis and I hope to play my full part in assuringthis,'' Mrs. de Greiff said.   The justice minister, who met Monday with Attorney General DickThornburgh and other top Justice Departments aides, continued talksTuesday with the Bush administration about her request for another$19 million to protect Colombia's judges from assassination.   The administration only last week approved a $65-million militaryaid program, and the Pentagon said Tuesday that disbursement offunds under that program is awaiting Colombia's list of needs.   At the news conference, Mrs. de Greiff told reporters, ``We mustuphold the rule of law, and regrettably at this moment that requiresintensive physical protection of our judges.''   The Bush administration has already promised $5 million over twoyears for training programs to bolster judicial security.   ``We have asked the United States for more support not only inwords but in resources,'' she told reporters. ``I am very pleasedwith what we have done, I think we can do more, but I think we canwork out things.''   Mrs. de Greiff, her country's eighth justice minister in threeyears, said she told Thornburgh that Colombia needed the additionalaid to buy armored cars, metal detectors and other security devicesto protect judges from the wave of assassinations mounted by thedrug cartel.   ``Both our countries are countries of laws even at a time whenour enemies are operating against us with no respect for law or eventhe minimal standards of decency,'' she said.   The State Department, meanwhile, updated its warning againstnon-essential travel for U.S. citizens in Colombia and suggested,for the first time, that American citizens living there considerleaving.   ``Although Americans have not yet been the target of anyviolence, visitors and Americans resident in Colombia shouldcarefully re-evaluate whether it is essential that they travel to orremain in Colombia at this time,'' said the new statement. ``Thedepartment believes it would be prudent for those who deem theirpresence non-essential to seriously consider leaving.''   The last travel advisory, issued last weekend, was limited torecommending that travel to Colombia be postponed for several weeks.In addition to raising the possibility of resident U.S. citizensleaving the country, the update also recommended that new travel toColombia be postponed indefinitely.   President Bush, who discussed his anti-drug strategy with topCabinet officials at his Maine seaside retreat, said theadministration ``will cooperate with Colombia to the best of ourability.''   The president declined to comment specifically on Mrs. deGreiff's request for more money but added that ``it's being workedout now, the details.''   The Pentagon said it will begin delivering military equipmentunder the $65 million aid package as soon as it receives a list ofmateriel sought by the Colombian government.   ``When the list is returned to the United States delivery willbegin,'' Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.   ``Officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs,''the spokesman said, adding, ``The DOD is ready to provide immediateairlift.   Williams declined to say what type of equipment would beprovided, noting in general terms it would be aircraft, weapons,ammunition, personal gear, communications equipment and medicalsupplies.   The Justice Department, meanwhile, raised the possibility thatits request to extradite drug trafficker Eduardo Martinez Ramirezcould be delayed while Colombia's Supreme Court reviews emergencyextradition procedures promulgated by President Virgilio Barco.   ``Those extradition procedures are complicated, and I think thereis a possibility there may be a decision to have the Supreme Courtin Colombia rule on those new procedures,'' said spokesman DavidRunkel.   Runkel backed away from Thornburgh's earlier prediction thatMartinez would be turned over to U.S. authorities this week, sayingthe procedure could take another week.   Nevertheless, he said, ``we have every hope and expectation ofgetting custody of Mr. Martinez.''   Mrs. de Greiff, asked about Runkel's comments, said she did notknow about a possible Supreme Court review of the emergencyextradition procedures. In 1987, the court set aside Colombia'sextradition law.   In a related development, the Justice Department persuaded theSenate Judiciary Committee to cancel a hearing set for Wednesday onthe Colombian drug crisis out of concern that publicity couldendanger law enforcement efforts.   Runkel said the department advised the panel that ``because ofthe sensitive nature of the situation in Colombia at this time thatit would not be appropriate to have an open hearing.''   David Westrate, the assistant administrator of the DrugEnforcement Administration was set to testify.   The panel's chairman, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said in astatement that committee members would be briefed privately thisweek.   Runkel said the Justice Department was also drafting extraditionrequests for 12 other Colombian drug traffickers under federalindictment.   The department wanted Colombia ``to have the paperwork so thatwhen someone is captured we would be in a position to haveeverything signed sealed and delivered to the United States.''   Mrs. de Greiff was asked about whether her son understood thedanger posed by her continuation as justice minister.   ``My son is three years old, I think he doesn't understand all ofthe problems that's involved,'' she replied. ``But he knowssomething about it. I explained to him some things. So I hope he issafe and we are all safe.''</TEXT></DOC>
