The union made the request of the National Mediation Board evenas it continued negotiations with Eastern in talks ordered by thebankruptcy judge overseeing the airline, which filed for courtprotection from its creditors after its Machinists union struck inMarch.   A Mediation Board spokesman said the request had not been loggedin as of the close of business Tuesday. But the union provided acopy of the filing, which the union said was delivered to the boardTuesday afternoon.   Most pilots have honored Machinists' pickets lines and underlabor law are considered legal sympathy strikers.   But the request for mediation could trigger a pilots' strike aswell. Nearly 300 ALPA pilots have crossed Machinists picket linesbut ALPA officials contend most of them would refuse to work iftheir union struck Eastern.   Mediation also would add a number of legal and jurisdictionalquestions that are likely to further complicate Eastern's legalodyssey.   Airline disputes are regulated by the Railway Labor Act, whichgives the mediation board broad powers to try to resolve contractdisputes. Unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless releasedfrom mediation, a situation which occurred prior to the Machinistsstrike. Mediation requests generally are granted as a matter ofroutine.   Eastern last week sough bankruptcy court permission to cancel itscontract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and work rulesit said it needed to reorganize as a smaller carrier.   Parties engaged in federal mediation, however, are prohibitedfrom altering terms of their contracts. Mediation Board spokesmanDavid Bushnell said he believed a mediation request involving acompany in bankruptcy proceedings was unprecedented and could notsay what it would mean for Eastern's bid to abrogate the pilots'contract.   ``If in fact mediation is granted, that issue would probably endup in court,'' said Bushnell.   Board procedures call for the appointment of a mediator and afact-finding process that takes several weeks. The mediator thenwould arrange sessions between the parties, which already areinvolved in bankruptcy court proceedings and the contract talksordered by that court.   If the mediator declared an impasse, a 30-day cooling off periodwould begin after which the union would be free to strike and theairline free to change provisions of existing contracts.   Union spokesman Ron Cole said the union decided to seek mediationafter Eastern officials refused to schedule future negotiatingsessions under terms of the Railway Labor Act. Those sessions wouldbe separate from the bargaining ordered by the bankruptcy judge. Asecond meeting under that process was held Tuesday but resulted inno progress, Cole said.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said company officials believedthe bankruptcy court proceedings would supersede the authority ofthe Mediation Board.   He disputed the union's assertion that Eastern had refused tobargain under the Railway Labor Act, saying Eastern declined to meetwith the union because it has not made a counter-offer to a proposalEastern made three weeks ago.   ``We don't know what they are trying to accomplish with themediation,'' he said. ``We believe that the bankruptcy court and theexaminer are better able to handle bankruptcy-related laboragreements.''   Also Tuesday, ALPA and Eastern exchanged a new round of chargesand contract charges about whether the carrier will be able torecruit and train enough new pilots to meet its planned summerschedule.   The union said its analysis of new pilot hiring and trainingindicated that Eastern would fall at least 236 pilots short, perhapsas many as 358, of the 837 it would need to fly the August scheduleit has presented to its creditors.   Eastern dismissed the union's conclusions as the product of``voodoo arithmetic'' and the overall report as part of attempts bythe pilots and Eastern's other unions to force Texas Air Corp. tosell the airline.   ``We have no shortage of employees or other staff to fly theschedule,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Cermesak. ``The criticismof insufficient resources will continue as long as they are on theoutside looking in.''   She said Eastern had told the creditors committee it would fly221 flights a day in July but had revised the schedule to 226flights because of progress in training replacements.   Eastern figures indicate that 276 of its pre-strike pilots havebeen crossing picket lines and about 100 replacements have completedtraining and begun carrying passengers. More than 500 pilots are intraining.   Industry analysts have said the airline will be hard-pressed torecruit and train enough pilots to reach 1,700 by the end of theyear, the number it would need to meet its reorganization goal.</TEXT></DOC>
