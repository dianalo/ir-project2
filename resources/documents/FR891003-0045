Prior to the amendments, taking could beallowed incidentally to most Federal activities and federally regulatedor funded activities under section 7 of the ESA, but could not be allowedincidentally to strictly private activities. The 1982 amendments authorizethe Secretaries to issue permits, under limited circumstances, allowinga taking of endangered species incidentally to an otherwise lawful activity.These regulations propose procedures for issuing permits for the incidentaltake of endangered species under the jurisdiction of NOAA Fisheries, Departmentof Commerce. These species are identified in 50 CFR 222.23(a), and arereferred to in this document as endangered marine species. All other endangeredspecies are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Department of the Interior, and are subject to the incidental taking provisionsat 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.32. Section 10(a)(l)(B) of the ESA authorizes NOAA Fisheries to permit a takingof an endangered marine species otherwise prohibited by section 9(a)(1)(B)of the ESA if the taking is incidentally to, and not the purpose of, anotherwise legal activity. Section 9(a)(1)(B) prohibits the taking of anyendangered species within the United States or its territorial sea. Thus,ESA section 10 incidental take permits can be issued only for activitieswhich may incidentally take endangered marine species within the UnitedStates or the U.S. territorial sea. These permits will not be issued foractivities, such as commercial fishing, that occur outside the territorialsea. Section 10(a)(2)(A) requires each applicant for an incidental take permitto submit a conservation plan that specifies (i) the impact which willlikely result from such taking; (ii) what steps will be taken to minimizeand mitigate such impacts, and the funding that will be available to implementsuch steps; (iii) what alternative actions to such taking have been consideredand the reasons why such alternatives are not being used; and (iv) suchother measures that NOAA Fisheries may require as being necessary or appropriatefor purposes of the plan. The proposed regulations would establish two categories of permits: anESA section 10 individual incidental take permit and an ESA section 10general incidental take permit. The individual permit would cover the activitiesof a single applicant, such as a corporation, that resulted in the incidentaltake of an endangered marine species. A general permit would cover theactivities of members of a group or organization, such as a fishing association,who wish to conduct activities in a specific geographical area that havesimilar impacts on endangered marine species. After a general permit isissued, members of the group, as well as unaffiliated individuals suchas fishermen who were not members, could obtain coverage under its termsby applying for and receiving a certificate of inclusion. An applicantfor a certificate of inclusion must agree to comply with the terms andconditions of the general permit and the conservation plan. As required by section 10(a)(2)(B), NOAA Fisheries will issue the permitif it finds, after notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> and opportunity for comments, that (i) the takingwill be incidental; (ii) the applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable,minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking; (iii) the applicant willensure that adequate funding for the plan will be provided; (iv) the takingwill not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recoveryof the species in the wild; and (v) any additional measures required byNOAA Fisheries as being necessary or appropriate for the purposes of theconservation plan will be met. NOAA Fisheries will prescribe terms andconditions to ensure that appropriate conservation measures are taken,including reporting requirements, and may revoke the permit if the termsand conditions of the permit are not being complied with.<ITAG tagnum="84">Relation to Section 7 of the ESA </ITAG>The incidental take provisions of section 10 parallel certain provisionsof section 7 of the ESA. Section 7(a)(2) requires all Federal agencies,in consultation with NOAA Fisheries, to ensure that any action authorized,funded, or  carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of any endangered or threatened marine species or result in thedestruction or adverse modification of the critical habitat of that species.Under section 7(b)(4), when an agency action that may involve incidentaltaking is found to be consistent with section 7(a)(2), NOAA Fisheries issuesan incidental take statement authorizing an incidental take and specifyingthe terms and conditions necessary to monitor the taking and minimize theimpact of such taking. Thus, Federal agencies and private entities regulatedor funded by the Federal agency may carry out activities resulting in theincidental take of endangered species consistent with the incidental takestatement without violating the ESA and without a section 10 permit. Congress amended section 20 of the ESA to address incidental taking associatedwith actions that are not covered by section 7. Under section 10, individualsor entities not otherwise covered by a section 7 incidental take statementcan apply for incidental take permits. These permits would provide exemptionsfrom the taking prohibitions similar to those made under section 7 incidentaltake statements given to Federal agencies. Since the section 7 incidental take statement only covers activities wherethere is continuing Federal involvement or control, section 10 incidentaltake permits may be appropriate for certain Federally regulated or fundedactivities where there is no continuing Federal involvement over a projectonce the Federal permit, authorization or funding is made. Federally regulatedor funded projects that sustain Federal involvement throughout the lifeof the project remain subject to the provisions of section 7 of the ESA.Section 10 permits may also be issued in cases where a section 7 incidentaltake does not appear to be provided for, such as the taking of marine mammalsincidentally to commercial fishing operations within the U.S. territorialsea. A section 7 incidental take statement cannot be issued in this casesince in order to issue an incidental take statement for marine mammals,the taking must be authorized under section 101(a)(5) of the Marine MammalProtection Act which applies to activities other than commercial fishing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pre-application Assistance </ITAG>Any person considering applying for an ESA section 10 incidental take permitmay contact NOAA Fisheries for assistance before submitting an application.To the extent practicable, NOAA Fisheries will (1) review the requirementsof these regulations and determine if a permit is necessary; (2) identifyand provide information on listed and proposed species that may be presentin the vicinity of the proposed action; (3) identify possible alternativesto avoid an incidental take; and (4) identify possible mitigating measures.Persons engaging in pre-application discussion are in no way required toapply for a permit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conservation Plan </ITAG>In developing a conservation plan, the applicant must use the best scientificand commercial data available to identify potential impacts to the endangeredspecies and to incorporate the most effective use of research and technologyto monitor, minimize and mitigate such impacts. The applicant has the responsibilityfor securing appropriate data for the preparation of a conservation planalthough NOAA Fisheries will provide assistance to the extent practicable(see ``Pre-application Assistance'' above). All information requirementsmust be satisfied before NOAA Fisheries will process a permit application.The conservation plan need only address listed species, although the applicantmay include species that have been proposed for listing to facilitate earlyresolution of potential endangered species conflicts. This may avoid delaysin processing or the need to revise the conservation plan and modify thepermit should the species become listed after the permit is issued. However,failure to include proposed species will not be a factor in deciding whetherto issue or deny a requested permit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Duration of Permits </ITAG>Since some projects may take many years to complete, applicants may needlong-term permits. To provide sufficient incentives for the private sectorto participate in the development of long-term conservation plans, NOAAFisheries has the discretion to issue ESA section 10 incidental take permitsthat run for periods significantly longer than are commonly provided forunder current administrative practices. In determining the duration ofa permit, NOAA Fisheries will consider the duration of the proposed activitiesas well as the possible positive and negative effects associated with issuinga long-term permit, including the extent to which the conservation planis likely to enhance the habitat of the endangered species or increasethe survivability of the species. Since circumstances and information may change over time, the originalplan might need to be revised. Therefore, any plan approved for a long-termpermit must contain a procedure by which NOAA Fisheries and the permitholder will deal with unforeseen circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="84">Terms and Conditions of Permits </ITAG>Permit conditions will be based on the extent of a project's anticipatedimpacts on the species at issue. In establishing terms and conditions necessaryand appropriate to minimize adverse impacts to endangered species, NOAAFisheries will consider the scope, magnitude and duration of a proposedproject, the anticipated level of take, and the availability of technologicallyand economically feasible methods of avoiding or reducing incidental takings.Examples of possible mitigating measures include restricting the time orarea of certain activities (such as the use of explosives), relocatingindividual animals from designated sites, and modifying techniques or equipment(such as fishing gear or water intake structures). <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>NOAA Fisheries has determined that this action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment and has prepared an environmental assessmentfor this proposed rulemaking. Therefore, an environmental impact statementis not required. The environmental assessment is available upon request(see <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>).  The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, Department of Commerce,determined that this is not a major rule requiring a regulatory impactanalysis under E.O. 12291. The proposed regulations are not likely to resultin (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries or governmentagencies; or (3) significant adverse effect on competition, employment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities because the rule reflects changes made to the Endangered SpeciesAct and is intended to provide guidance for potential applicants concerningprocedures and requirements for obtaining permits to take endangered speciesincidentally to an otherwise lawful activity. This proposed rule contains a collection of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for approval. The proposed rule contains three sets of informationcollections subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act: (1) Applications forincidental take permits under andSection; 222.22(b); (2) applications forcertificates of inclusion under andSection; 222.22(g)(1); and (3) reportingrequirements of issued permits under andSection; 222.22(d)(1). Public reportingburden for this collection of information is estimated to average 80 hoursfor permit applications, .5 hours for certificate of inclusion applications,and .5 hours for reports. These estimates include the time for reviewinginstructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theseburden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of ProtectedResources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East West Highway, SilverSpring, MD 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 (Attn: PaperworkReduction Project_0648-XXXX). This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 222 </ITAG>Endangered and threatened wildlife; Administrative practice and procedure;Exports; Fish; Imports; Marine mammals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulation Promulgation </ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 222 is proposed tobe amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 222_ENDANGERED FISH OR WILDLIFE </ITAG>1.
