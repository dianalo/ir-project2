More than 40 people suffered mostly minor injuries in the 1 p.m.accident when the two trains drove into each other two miles east ofGlasgow center, said Scotrail.   The last two injured _ a train driver and a passenger _ weretaken from the wreckage about four hours after the accident, saidBilly Caldwell, a spokesman for the state-owned company. Killed werethe other driver and a passenger.   The 44 injured were taken to hospitals, where five were admittedfor the night, Caldwell said.   On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured in a collisionof two British Rail trains near Purley Station on London's southernoutskirts. The ``preliminary conclusion'' of an investigation intothat crash said human error was the cause, the company said.   Scotrail is a division of British Rail, whose safety records havebeen under assault since December when a three-train crash killed 35people at Clapham Junction near London.   In the House of Commons, the opposition Labor Party's transportspokesman and other lawmakers attacked the government TransportSecretary Paul Channon on the railroad's safety record.   The Scottish crash ``confirms ... that we have been puttinginsufficient resources into preventing these accidents,'' saidlawmaker John Prescott, Labor's transport spokesman.   ``The government's policy is clearly on trial,'' he said.   Scottish National Party lawmaker Jim Sillars said, ``it is timewe did not have single inquiries into accidents of this kind, but acomprehensive review of the standing of BR (British Rail) inrelation to government policy as it relates to safety,'' he said.   Channon acknowledged concern but denied government budget-cuttingwas a factor.   ``The fact that there have been two serious accidents on BritishRail and now a third within three months is naturally a cause forconcern,'' Channon said.   He said inquiry boards into the latest two accidents will beordered to report quickly, and he added: ``I agree there is publicconcern about British Rail and about safety on the railways.''   He said investment in the state-run railway is at a record $963million this year due to rise to an average $1.29 billion annuallyfor the next four years.   In the Glasgow accident, the two short trains carrying about 70passengers were traveling between the suburbs of Springburn andMilngavie when they collided. Each was going about 30 mph, he said.   A warning explosive went off on the track before the accident,apparently triggered by a signalman in a box at the side of thetrack, but ``it was too late,'' said Caldwell.   That section of the track had been converted several years agofrom a double to a single track to save money, said Scotrail, but itinsisted it should have been safe.   ``We were all sitting down in the train, and suddenly there was alarge bang. People were thrown about all over the place,'' saidColin Smith, a student who was on one train.   After Saturday's crash, investigators found signs the driver ofone passenger train tried to stop at a red signal before his trainstruck another London-bound train.   British Rail said Monday a technical examination supported ``apreliminary conclusion that the accident was caused by human erroron the part of the driver.''   The driver was one of 94 people injured when his train, travelingfrom Littlehampton to London, hit a train traveling from Horsham tothe capital. Police said Monday that 31 people remainedhospitalized, 10 in serious condition.   Six cars rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash, andseveral came to rest in the yards of homes.   On Dec. 12, three trains crashed near busy Clapham Junctionduring rush hour, killing 35 people. Railway officials believe amalfunctioning signal caused that crash.   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Channon saying she was``greatly distressed'' to learn of the third accident Monday.Princess Diana, wife of Prince Charles, visited survivors of thePurley crash at a London hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
