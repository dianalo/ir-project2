The military said legal action would be taken against anyone whofailed to report for service.   Leaders of the End Conscription Campaign released names of theconscientious objectors at news conferences in six cities.Organizers said the protest was part of a nationwide defiancecampaign waged by anti-apartheid groups since early August.   As part of the campaign, about 9,000 people of all races stagedan anti-government march in Pietermaritzburg, one of many massdemonstrations staged since President F.W. de Klerk said hisgovernment will allow peaceful protests.   Police said when the crowd dispersed there was stonethrowing,several shop windows were broken and goods valued at severalthousand dollars were looted from stores. Police said no one wasarrested and there were no injuries reported.   Several major protests have taken place without incident sincethen, but Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the trouble inPietermaritzburg ``can in no way be compared with peaceful andorderly protests and will not be tolerated.''   In the nearby port of Durban, police arrested 38 high schoolstudents and teachers when they broke up a march of about 400 mostlyblack people protesting the acquittal of a black civic leadercharged with murdering a schoolboy.   Riot police in Johannesburg turned back several hundred studentsfrom the University of the Witwatersrand who wanted to march to alocal police station to protest the detention of fellow students.   Teachers and students in mixed-race areas of Cape Town heldseveral demonstrations, but no incidents were reported.   In Pretoria, Chief Justice Michael Corbett swore in the newCabinet a day after de Klerk's inauguration.   A pro-government Afrikaans newspaper, Beeld, said in a front-pagestory the Cabinet probably will decide within a week or so on thepossible release of Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other jailedleaders of the outlawed African National Congress guerrillamovement. Mandela is serving a life sentence since his 1962conviction for sabotage.   The draft resisters include many who have yet to be drafted andothers who have completed their two-year training but say they willnot attend mandatory call-up camps.   ``We are not prepared to serve in a racist defense force touphold a racist system,'' said Chris de Villiers, a lawyer andacting chairman of the End Conscription Campaign.   The military said it will take legal action against those whofail to report for service.   Military service is mandatory for all able-bodied white menunless they qualify as religious objectors or win delays, forexample to attend college.   Draft resisters face jail terms of up to six years, and severalmen have been sentenced in the past two years, including two whoreceived the maximum penalty.   A press statement said the new draft resisters includedprofessors, clergymen, executives and engineers.   ``We will respond to the call-up in different ways,'' thestatement said. ``Some will go to jail. Others will opt forreligious objector status. Many of us will choose between a life inexile or constant evasion of call-ups.''   De Villiers, a former army lieutenant, urged the government tointroduce a non-military alternative for political objectors.   The government does not release information on the manpower ofthe armed forces. But an estimated 68,000 conscripts are on activeduty and about 325,000 men are in the reserves at any one time.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28-million black majority has novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites, about half male,control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools andhealth services.</TEXT></DOC>
