(hereinafter called ``Facet'')carburetor models MA-4-5, MA-5, and MA-6AA manufactured after April 1984.This AD requires replacement of the air metering stop pin, P/N 62-226,within the next 200 hours time in service, or when the carburetor is removedfrom the engine, whichever occurs first, in accordance with Facet ServiceBulletin (SB) A1-88, dated August 1988. Also, a typographical error involvinga serial number, which appeared in the NPRM, has been corrected. This AD is needed to prevent a potential risk to the safety of flight,due to the possibility of the engine throttle becoming jammed inside thecarburetor if the air metering stop pin becomes loose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2><T3>Effective_</T3>March 8, 1989. <T3>Compliance_</T3>As required in the body of the AD. <T3>Incorporation by Reference_</T3>Approved by the Director of the FederalRegister as of March 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable Facet SB may be obtained from FacetAerospace Products, Co., 1048 Industrial Park Road, Bristol Virginia 24201.A copy of the SB is contained in Rules Docket No. 88-ANE-39, Office ofthe Assistant Chief Counsel, Federal Aviation Administration, New EnglandRegion, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803,and may be examined between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday, except federal holidays.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Pat Perrotta, Propulsion Branch,ANE-174, New York Aircraft Certification Office, Engine and Propeller Directorate,Aircraft Certification Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 181 SouthFranklin Avenue, Room 202, Valley Stream, New York 11581; telephone (516)791-7421.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations to adopt a new AD requiring replacement ofthe air metering stop pin, P/N 62-226, within the next 200 hours time inservice, or when the carburetor is removed from the engine, whichever occursfirst, in accordance with Facet Service Bulletin (SB) A1-88, dated August1988, was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 4, 1988, (53 FR 44612).The proposal was prompted by two cases of the air metering stop pin comingloose, and in one case preventing the throttle from being advanced. A totalof 189 available carburetors were inspected by Facet and twenty-three (23)units were found to be nonconforming; i.e., the retention fit of the pinto carburetor housing was below design requirements. This manufacturingdeviation could be present in any of the subject model carburetors manufacturedafter April 1984, and these carburetors have been identified by specificserial numbers. Also, in the proposal the following typographical errorwas noticed and is hereby corrected: Serial Number BD-5-1000 should beBD-5-10000. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. No comments were received and, consequently,except for the above correction, the proposal is adopted without change.The FAA has determined that this condition of a loose air metering stoppin is likely to exist or develop on other Facet carburetors, Models MA-4-5,MA-5, and MA-6AA. Therefore, this AD will require replacement of the pin,P/N 62-226, with another pin, P/N 62-F1, in accordance with Facet SB A1-88,within the next 200 hours time in service, or when the carburetor is removedfrom the engine, whichever occurs first. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The FAA has determined that this regulation involves approximately 2,050carburetors that must be modified at an approximate total cost of $400,000.Therefore, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) does notwarrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impactis so minimal; and (4) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Engines, Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation byreference. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) amends Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations (FAR) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
