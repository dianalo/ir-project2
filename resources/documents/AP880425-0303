The justices said they will use the case to decide a proceduralpoint on the relationship of federal and state court rulings incases based on state law.   Standby letters of credit are common in the business world. Theyare issued by banks to assure the prompt payment of money to onesigner of a contract if the other signer fails to live up to thecontract's terms.   The bank issuing such a letter of credit is required to makepayment only if it is presented with specified documents within aspecified time.   Exxon in 1981 contracted with Houston Oil andamp; Refining Inc. tomake reciprocal deliveries of crude oil.   Exxon agreed to ship 558,000 barrels of oil to Houston Oilduring July 1981, and Houston Oil agreed to ship an equal quantityof oil to Exxon from September through December of that year.   Houston Oil was issued a $19.3 million standby letter of creditby Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) that said $19.3million would be payable upon certification that Houston Oil failedto deliver the promised oil between September and December 1981.   But the certification had to be presented to Paribas ``not laterthan October 1981'' _ an inconsistency with the contract's terms.   Exxon, which delivered 558,000 barrels of oil to Houston Oil inJuly 1981, learned sometime in November 1981 that Houston Oil wouldnot be delivering any oil to it.   Exxon requested payment from Paribas on the letter of credit butthe bank refused, contending that Exxon's request was too late.   Exxon sued in federal court even though its lawsuit, allegingthe wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit, was based on Texascontract law. Exxon could do that so-called ``diversityjurisdiction'' rules because Paribas is not based in Texas.   A federal trial judge ruled for Exxon but the 5th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals last Oct. 8 reversed that ruling. ``We find thatthe obligation of the issuing bank had terminated even though itmight not have been possible to present to the bank the documentsrequired for payment bvefore the expiry date,'' the appeals courtsaid.   While Exxon's request for a rehearing was pending before the 5thCircuit court, a Texas appeals court ruled in a very similar casethat under such circumstances a letter of credit's expiration dateis unenforceable.   In the appeal acted on today, Exxon is asking the justices torule that the federal appeals court _ faced with a clearerdefinition of state law _ should set aside its October ruling andreconsider the case in light of the state court's intepretation ofTexas law.   Lawyers for Paribas argued that the 5th Circuit court's rulingwas based on ``well-settled principles of Texas law'' and shouldnot be reviewed.   The case is Exxon Company U.S.A. vs. Banque de Paris et desPays-bas, 87-1467.</TEXT></DOC>
