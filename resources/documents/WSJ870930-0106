Indeed, with little public attention, this city has become a magnet over the past five years for a new wave of Irish immigration to this country.    The difference this time is that virtually all the newcomers are here illegally and the new immigration law is raising anxiety levels even higher than before.    These illegals are far different from the traditional stereotype of the Hispanic slipping across the Rio Grande at night. Most of the Irish arrive in 747s bearing passports with six-month tourist visas and a list of friends or relatives to stay with. Driven from Ireland by a 19% unemployment rate and taxation that can take up to 60% of wages even when work is available, the visitors often overstay their visas and end up lingering in the U.S. for months or years. Benefiting from the English language and the superb Irish school system, they blend in easily and have little difficulty finding work in a metropolitan area with an unemployment rate of 3.3%.    &quot;Back home, there is absolutely no work to be had,&quot; says a 26-year-old hardware store clerk who will give his name only as Eoin. &quot;Here, there's plenty of work and the money is decent. All we want is work.&quot;    Numbers are always tricky when dealing with illegal immigrants, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates there are 10,000 Irish illegals in Boston. Those who work with the illegals say the numbers run between 20,000 and 30,000 in Boston, 50,000 to 75,000 in the New York area, and at least 100,000 nationwide.    The columns of local Irish newspapers here attest that, whatever the actual figures, the problem is substantial. There are ads from immigration lawyers promising help obtaining green cards, amnesty, visa extensions or postponing deportation. Ads for &quot;childminders,&quot; domestics, auto repairs and other job categories frequently filled by illegals are also common.    The lot of illegals has never been easy. They have always been reluctant to report crimes against them for fear the police will discover their status and deport them. Such everyday items as driver's licenses and checking accounts are denied them. To these traditional worries, however, have now been added the problem of what to do when changing jobs, since all employees hired after Nov. 6, 1986, have to prove they are in this country legally and can work.    Denise, a college graduate with a computer science degree, was in line for a promotion at the high-tech firm where she works, but felt obligated to tell her employers of her illegal status. &quot;Now I don't even know if they'll keep me on,&quot; she says, adding that she knows numerous Irish university graduates who are in the U.S. either working or looking.    To get around the problem of documentation, many young Irish men enter the construction trades. There are many contractors in the Boston area owned by second- and third-generation Irish-Americans who are willing to &quot;forget&quot; to ask about green cards, no matter what the law says. The workers end up doing quite well. Even if they are paid only half the $14 to $18 an hour that an American construction worker can command, the fact that they work &quot;off the books&quot; and are paid in cash means no income taxes. With overtime, their take-home pay can average between $400 and $600 a week, which is high even by U.S. standards.    &quot;They may be getting by, but being illegal is no good for the long haul,&quot; says Frank Costello, a scholar of Irish history and Boston Mayor Ray Flynn's adviser on Irish-American affairs. &quot;It hurts us too. We lose the taxes they would be paying otherwise, we lose their entrepreneurial talents because they can't start their own businesses. They can't advance themselves. It's hard on the immigrants, sure, but it's definitely a two-way street.&quot;    Because the wave of new Irish immigrants really began only when the Irish economy took a downturn in 1982, few of the illegals qualify under the amnesty program for longtime illegal residents. The large and politically influential Irish-American community, however, has awakened to what it sees as an intolerable situation and last June founded the Irish Immigration Reform movement, which now has chapters both here and in New York.    The goal of the organization is to open up the U.S. for more immigrants from Ireland and the inhabitants of 35 other, mostly European, countries adversely affected by the 1965 U.S. Immigration Act. A bill recently introduced by two members of the Massachusetts delegation, Sen. Edward Kennedy and Rep. Brian Donnelly, would end what they call discrimination against European immigrants. Last year, only 515 immigrant visas were allocated to Ireland out of a total of 270,000. Although Irish people received 3,112 out of 10,000 special visas granted when the new immigration law was passed last year, it was a one-time only offering and came nowhere near satisfying demand. The Kennedy-Donnelly bill would increase the number of permanent-residence visas by 50,000 to 320,000 a year on a point system that would largely favor Europeans.    This wouldn't help those already living and working in this country, however. A solution suggested by Mr. Costello, the mayor's adviser, is extending the new immigration law's &quot;guest worker&quot; provision -- designed mostly to benefit Hispanics in the Southwest -- to European immigrants. The mechanics, however, have not yet been worked out. Mr. Costello also has suggested resurrecting a system that would permit the Irish to serve in the military and then apply for citizenship -- a path taken by this writer's father in the early 1950s.    In the meantime, the Irish come anyway, regardless of the law. And independent evidence suggests that -- barring a dramatic turnaround in the Irish economy -- they will keep on coming. A recent poll published in the Dublin-based Irish Independent newspaper shows that 62% of all Irish between the ages of 15 and 24 say they are &quot;likely&quot; to leave. Nearly half of those who said they were planning to emigrate report they had a close relative (brother, sister, spouse) who had already gone abroad. Only 15% said they would stay put in Ireland no matter what.    The Irish experience belies the hoary notion that immigrants come to this country to &quot;get on welfare.&quot; Ireland has a complete welfare state that provides generous unemployment and welfare benefits along with free medical care and subsidized housing. The lure of plentiful work in the U.S. is so strong, however, that Irish immigrants are willing to leave all that behind and risk defying not only the immigration laws but the far more immediate hazards of American urban life such as crime, low vacancy rates and high medical bills.    The general attitude of many Irish illegals was summed up by a young Irish man who was warned by his father that the immigration authorities would eventually catch up to him. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Listen dad. I don't feel that I'm doing anything illegal. I'm trying to make a future for myself.&quot;    ---   Mr. Barnes is chief editorial writer for the Boston Herald. </TEXT></DOC>
