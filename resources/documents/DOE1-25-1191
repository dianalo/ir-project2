<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-1191 </DOCNO><TEXT>Osmotic coefficients for aqueous (lithium sulfate + cesium sulfate), (sodiumsulfate + cesium sulfate), and (potassium sulfate + cesium sulfate) at298.15 K have been measured isopiestically. Parameters of Pitzer's modelhave been calculated from these measurements. The predicted solubilityfor the above mixtures using Pitzer's approach showed good agreementwith experimental results. 3Li{sub 2}SO{sub 4} radical Cs{sub 2}SO{sub4} radical 2H{sub 2}O and Li{sub 2}SO{sub 4} radical Cs{sub 2}SO{sub4} were found to crystallize from (lithium sulfate + cesium sulfate)(aq)at 298.15 K. Based on solubilities, calculated activity coefficients,and measured enthalpies of solution of crystalline compounds, thermodynamicquantities were determined.</TEXT></DOC>
