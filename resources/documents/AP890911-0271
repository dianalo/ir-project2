The 32-bit i960CA chip, smaller than a dime but more than twiceas fast as the i486 chip Intel introduced last spring, packs 600,000transistors and is the first commercial chip to employ``super-scalar'' technology.   Super-scalar design allows a chip to execute more than oneinstruction for each tick of its internal clock.   Instead of cramming more transistors onto the chips to get themto work faster during each cycle _ the i486, for example, has 1.2million transistors _ Intel appears to have solved the elusiveproblem of how to get the chip to carry out two instructions percycle.   ``Imagine a car wash that can run two lanes through at a timeinstead of one,'' said Michael Slater, editor of MicroprocessorReport, an industry newsletter in Palo Alto. ``The car wash with twolanes can obviously get more cars through in the same time.''   Intel's speed rating for the i960CA chip is derived from takingthe chip's clock speed _ 33 million cycles per second _ and doublingit.   Many other chipmakers are working on super-scalar designs, saidSlater, who expects to see several of those products next year andmany more in 1991.   Millard H. Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist in SanFrancisco, said the i960 shows that ``we're going into a new era''of microprocessors.   ``Computers have been doing multitasking and multiprocessing andwe're going in that direction right down to the chip itelf,'' Phelpssaid. ``That's quite a departure.''   Intel, the company that invented the microprocessor, says thei960CA is the fastest 32-bit chip yet. But the chip, which isexpected to be priced at about $300, isn't compatible with MS-DOS orother software commonly used in desktop computers and isn't expectedto have an immediate impact on that market.   Instead, the chip is aimed at laser printers, robot controllers,telephone switching systems and automobiles of the future. The autoindustry, which is largely using 8-bit chips, is slowly moving intofaster 16-bit chips and may be several years away from using thesuper-fast 32-bit chips to control brakes and engines.   The i960 design has been endorsed by a group of avionics systemssuppliers, and could have a significant impact in that field, saidThomas A. Thornhill of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in San Francisco.   ``That's a pretty strong endorsement for the architecture,''Thornhill said.   ``What I think is interesting beyond the product itself,''Thornhill said, ``is that some of the design techniques used toachieve the super-scalar architecture may be applicable to Intel'sother chips and may show up in other products, like the i860 andfuture versions of the 486. In the past Intel has tended to do someof its design work in modular form, so can be applied or altered forother chips.''   Intel's i860 chip, introduced earlier this year, also is capableof doing certain types of operations two at a time, but doesn'temploy the super-scalar design. The i860, a 64-bit microprocessorwith more than 1 million transistors, is capable of performing up to80 million calculations per second. The $750 chip is designed forhigh-end workstations and is more math-intensive than the i960CA.</TEXT></DOC>
