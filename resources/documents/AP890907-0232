The chip, no larger than a fingernail, was developed by Air Forceresearchers. Air Force and Department of Energy researchers willconcentrate on joint study to develop chips to detect poison gasesand degrading detonators.   ``I think what we've developed is a very sound scientifictechnique that can be used for detecting very small concentrationsof gas,'' said Kolesar. The chemical-sensitive membrane lets gasthrough to trigger an electronic signal.   Such chips could be installed in nuclear warheads to detect thechemicals given off by the degradation of chemicals in the warheads,he said. ``What we really see though is that because the technologyis generic, by putting down different membranes ... it's essentiallylimitless.''   For example, the devices could be used by workers to signalunacceptable levels of hazardous materials, Kolesar said.Dosimeters, which are used in many cases to detect toxic materials,only reveal exposure after the fact.   Another possible application is in developing lighter andstronger metals by combining existing metals, he said. ``There is anoptimum cure temperature and cure length cycle,'' which the chipcould be used to pinpoint.   It also could be used to ferret out bombs by the chemicals theyemit. Current detectors for measuring contaminants are mostly bulkyand vulnerable to being confused by the presence of more than onechemical, he said.   The microchips so far have been developed to detect only organicphosphate and nitrogen dioxide, said Kolesar, who has been workingon the process for 12 years. It will take another three to fiveyears for commercial development.   ``It's very rewarding to change something quite dramatically,''he said. ``You probably get only one of those opportunities inlife.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
