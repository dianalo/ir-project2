The moves by the nation's third-largest bank bring some ofChase's pricing policies more in line with those of banksacross the country and could foreshadow future fee increasesby other big New York banks. Chase is also encouragingcustomers to increase deposit balances as a way of avoidingthe fee increases.</LP><TEXT>   For the first time, Chase will charge more for cashwithdrawals made through ATMs of other banks than forwithdrawals from its own machines. Customers of Chase, likethose of many other banks, can withdraw cash from ATMs ofother banks through networks known as the New York CashExchange and Plus System.   The major competitors of Chase, the main unit of ChaseManhattan Corp., have varying ATM fee policies.   Nationwide, most banks charge fees for withdrawals madethrough machines other than their own, according to MarciaSullivan, legislative counsel for the Consumer BankersAssociation. It is much more common than charging fortransactions at a machine of the institutions, she says.   If Chase customers maintain average monthly balances inall of their accounts at certain levels, generally $3,000 or$5,000, Chase won't impose a monthly fee or fees for check orATM transactions. If a customer's average balance falls belowthe required level, Chase currently imposes a fee of 25 centsper check or ATM withdrawal. The ATM fee is the same nomatter which machine is used. But effective April 1, Chasewill impose a fee of 75 cents for any ATM withdrawal madethrough a non-Chase machine in the ATM networks.   The networks charge each bank a fee when their customersuse machines operated by other banks. A Chase spokesman saidthe increase in its fees was based on an analysis of therevenue that Chase receives from the ATM networks and thefees it pays out. In addition, he said, &quot;we spent a lot ofmoney in the last year or so upgrading our own ATM system andwe hope people will make use of it.&quot;   On savings accounts, Chase will increase the minimumaverage monthly balance required to avoid fees to $1,000 from$500. The fees will increase to $5 a month from $2.50 amonth. Accounts for children less than 18 years old or seniorcitizens over 65 are exempt from the minimum balancerequirements.</TEXT></DOC>
