But there is mounting concern thatairlines are resorting to sophisticated and illegal tacticsto subvert the fare competition that deregulation hadencouraged.   The Justice Department has begun four separateinvestigations of possible antitrust violations in theindustry. The investigations focus on suspected collusion,predatory pricing and efforts by airlines to blockcompetition in certain markets. The industry has denied anywrongdoing.</LP><TEXT>   In the newest development, the government has sentairlines formal requests for information on theirrelationship with Airline Tariff Publishing Co., the industryclearinghouse for fares. It has been learned that majorcarriers have begun receiving what are known as civilinvestigative demands from the department. The 18-pagerequest states that the government is investigating possibleprice-fixing.   Trust-busters appear most concerned with industryconcentration at airports dominated by only one or twoairlines. In cities such as St. Louis, Minneapolis andPittsburgh, a single carrier now boards more than 70% ofpassengers. Studies have shown such dominance results inhigher fares.   Many of the near-monopolies were created by airlinemergers in the 1980s. But airlines also have developed noveland complex tactics for defending their turf -- some of whichthe government may decide to challenge. Investigators areexamining, among other things, the control of airport gatesand takeoff and landing slots. In Pittsburgh, the JusticeDepartment is looking at whether an agreement to build a newairport terminal effectively locks in USAir's 80%-plus shareof that market. USAir denies any wrongdoing, but itsagreement has drawn fire because it prevents other carriersfrom moving into the old terminal it will vacate.   The most controversial practices, however, have to do withthe way carriers publish prices through a commonly ownedcomputer network. Operated by Airline Tariff Publishing,based in Washington, D.C., the system was designed to provideinstantaneous transmission of more than 100,000 domestic farechanges that take place each day in the industry.Centralizing this information makes it easier for airlines toenter the data in their computer reservations systems fortravel agents.   But critics in and out of government believe it alsoprovides a behind-the-scenes system that enables airlines tocommunicate pricing intentions to one another. According toformer and current airline pricing officials, fare changesand computer coding sometimes contain signals to othercarriers.   The Wall Street Journal has found evidence of such&quot;conversations&quot; by arranging to tap directly into ATP'selectronic database. The crucial signals between carriers,people in the industry say, translate as follows: &quot;Let medetermine the prices at my hub airport and I'll let you dothe same at yours.&quot;   Says Donald Garvett, a former vice president of revenuemanagement at Pan American World Airways: &quot;It's almost likeelectronic negotiation.&quot; But, he says, &quot;I wouldn't like tosuggest that anyone is doing anything illegal. It's normalprocedure to defend your turf.&quot;   All of the major carriers except Eastern Airlines refusedrequests for interviews on the subject. Several said it wastoo sensitive in light of the Justice Department'sinvestigations.   David Kunstler, vice president of planning at Eastern, asubsidiary of Continental Airlines Holding Inc., said in aninterview that he has &quot;no knowledge&quot; that carriers signaleach other through ATP.   &quot;The word signalling implies an element of collusion, andwe set prices independent of any other airline,&quot; he said. &quot;Ifanybody at Eastern Airlines were engaging in that kind ofactivity, I would absolutely tell them to cease and desist.&quot;   Others, however, say signalling does take place, and itamounts to a subtle version of the type of price-fixing thatonce took place in smoke-filled rooms. &quot;It's a seriousproblem,&quot; says Ian Ayers, a specialist on antitrust issues atNorthwestern University's law school. The use of the computernetwork &quot;is a way of facilitating collusion,&quot; he says. &quot;It'seasier to reach agreements. It's easier to detect breaches ofan agreement.&quot;   Before Braniff went into bankruptcy proceedings last year,pricing officials at the carrier became so concerned aboutthe communications they were seeing on computer terminalsthat they began keeping a log of suspected antitrustviolations. The log has since vanished, former Braniffemployees say.   The most common -- and perhaps most questionable --&quot;discussion&quot; between airlines is played out like this:Carrier A -- often a smaller operator such as Midway Airlinesor America West -- attempts to boost its business by loweringticket prices. It enters lower fares in the industry'scomputer system. In response, Carrier B -- the dominantcarrier at the affected airport -- not only matches the newfares, but lowers them in other markets that are served byCarrier A.   Carrier B may also attach special codes to its new faresto get its message across. Pricing executives say somecarriers have been known to prefix new fares with the letters&quot;FU&quot; to indicate an indelicate imperative. The end result isthat Carrier A often cancels its reduction, deprivingconsumers of a lower fare.   This pattern has occurred many times.   Last summer, for instance, America West Airlines tried toattract more business in several markets, includingMinneapolis, with lower fares payable 21 days in advance.Bargain-hunting vacationers typically respond to such deals.   America West's reductions might have pressured NorthwestAirlines to cut fares on its busy Minneapolis-Los Angelesroute to $258 a round trip from $308 to match the AmericaWest fare. Instead, Northwest set a new fare that struckdirectly at America West's hub in Phoenix. Northwest loweredits cheapest fare between Phoenix and New York to $168 around trip from $208 -- but initially made the low fareavailable for only two days.   That, people in the industry say, was sufficient todeliver to America West a signal. Five days after institutingits bargain fares, America West abandoned them. Northwestsays it makes about 20,000 fare changes a day and cannotreconstruct them a year later, but it says &quot;competitiveinitiatives and responses&quot; are a constant part of itspricing.   Such exchanges take place in the context of a broad,continuing dialogue within the computer system -- wherecarriers have developed a language for talking to each other.Former and current airline pricing officials say that when acarrier wants to communicate its displeasure with aneighbor's fare cut, it sometimes matches the new fare for ashorter lifespan. That, they say, is a warning to remove thenew fare from the system.   Last summer, both Northwest Airlines and Midway Airlineswere offering bargain fares on the Chicago-Grand Rapids,Mich., route, effective until July 31. Continental andAmerican had matched the fares, but set their expirationdates earlier, for July 17. People in the businessinterpreted this as a warning to Northwest and Midway to endtheir bargain fares earlier, too. Northwest moved up itsexpiration date to July 21, and Midway to July 18.   Another tactic is more subtle. When any fare is changedeven slightly, the electronic tariff program highlights it inthe computer system. Sometimes a carrier will make a weird ornonsensical change in a fare just so that analysts at anotherairline will see the fare highlighted. The message: &quot;Get ridof this fare.&quot;   Antitrust law makes it illegal for companies to conspireto fix prices or even attempt to do so. Proving that this hashappened is easier when prosecutors can show evidence of aface-to-face meeting or telephone call.   The law is less clear when indirect signaling could beinvolved. One test is whether a company's actions appeareconomically sound. In 1974, the Second Circuit Court ofAppeals in New York ruled that it was important to determinewhether &quot;a seller's conduct . . . is contrary to itsindependent self-interest&quot; in a price-fixing case. Cuttingfares more deeply than necessary to undercut the competition,for example, would seem intended as a warning to thecompetition rather than a genuinely competitive and economicreduction, especially if fares quickly return to a higherlevel.   Many of the back-and-forth fare tactics in the airlineindustry appear to have little economic relevance to themarket involved. To critics, this supports the notion thatairlines are often signalling each other rather thanpermitting supply and demand alone to dictate fares.   Last year, according to a person close to the situation,United Airlines pricing officials were miffed when Braniffcut fares on flights between Chicago and Los Angeles, alucrative route for United. In response, according to thisperson, United introduced a $99 one-way fare between LosAngeles and Kansas City, which was then Braniff's hub. TheUnited price cut, from a starting fare of $149, seemedextreme; United was charging almost three times as much tofly from Kansas City to Denver. But Braniff, desperate tostay in business, failed to back down, even after Unitedagain reduced the Los Angeles-Kansas City fare to $94.&quot;United Airlines declines to comment other than to state itspricing decisions are based on the competitive marketplace,&quot;the UAL unit said in a statement yesterday.   Fares in and out of Kansas City have risen considerablysince the Braniff bankruptcy. Last year, travelers could flybetween Kansas City and St. Louis for $78 round trip.Yesterday, the lowest fare was $135.   In coding its new Los Angeles-Kansas City fare on thecomputer system last year United inserted as part of the codethe letters &quot;FLYUA.&quot; Critics suspect that this and similarcoding shows that carriers sometimes are only interested insending each other a message. Last November, ContinentalAirlines used the letters &quot;HP&quot; in the combination of lettersand numbers used to code new, lower fares on flights betweenPhoenix and Omaha, Wichita, Baltimore and New York City; thelowest round-trip fare between Phoenix and New York wasreduced to $218 from $228. &quot;HP&quot; is normally the industry codefor America West, which a few days before had invadedContinental's turf in Houston with new service and low fares.   After America West withdrew its low introductory fares,Continental withdrew its &quot;HP&quot; fares. A Continental spokesmansays, &quot;Continental does not engage in or endorse any type ofsignaling concerning air fares.&quot;   The Justice Department request that was sent to carriersrecently asks for detailed information on how airlines usethe computer system to &quot;implement fare changes, monitorfares, {and} make decisions on fares,&quot; and on how they mightoperate without access to the system.   It also requests all information about the carrier'srelationship with the ATP system dating back to Jan. 1, 1988.The government is seeking all documents, training manuals andnewsletters related to ATP, as well as the name and positionof all employees who handle pricing decisions. The JusticeDepartment is also requesting documents dating back to Jan.1, 1986, on ATP's role in how carriers monitor, influence andreact to fare changes.   In an incident last September, it took the nation'sairlines only nine days to match an American Airlinesproposal to raise many fares. That incident, too, is beinginvestigated by the Justice Department.   It involved the controversial practice of announcing fareincreases through the computer system in advance, or&quot;pre-announcing.&quot; While this gives consumers advance noticeof fare increases, it may also insure that no carrier standsalone with higher fares. &quot;It's an abuse of the system,&quot; saysJohn Timmons, minority counsel on the U.S. Senate aviationsubcommittee. &quot;The information age has redefined antitrust.We don't need Mr. Smith to call Mr. Jones.&quot;   American denies any wrongdoing. &quot;We have followed thespirit and the letter of the law,&quot; a spokeswoman says.   Last August, United proposed increasing fares by $20 onmany flights in and out of Chicago. The increases were totake effect in September. American, United's biggestcompetitor in Chicago, matched the proposed increases, whichbecame effective in September.   Some of the airlines' computer exchanges raise questionsas to whether they are using their fares to disciplinecompetitors who are out of step. When Northwest slashed faresout of Chicago last August, a pricing executive at a rivalcarrier privately threatened to &quot;trash&quot; Northwest'sMinneapolis hub if Northwest didn't retreat. When Deltawouldn't go along with a fare increase in January 1989, apricing executive at a competing airline privately spoke of&quot;bombing&quot; Delta's Atlanta hub of operations. A spokesman forDelta says, &quot;They can do what they want. We don't have anycontrol over what another carrier does or says.&quot;   By trashing and bombing, airlines executives mean punitivefare-cutting with &quot;torture&quot; fares. Midway Airlines, people inthe industry say, has been repeatedly &quot;disciplined&quot; by othercarriers for trying to go its own way on fares. Midway, apost-deregulation startup, is one of the last survivinglow-fare airlines. Pricing, says Sen. John Danforth ofMissouri, &quot;cries out for scrutiny.&quot;   ---           Powerful on Land as Well as in the Air                                                                                                          Market share of selected airports, based on 1989 data ofenplaned passengers, in percent                      Chicago O'Hare                                                                                                          United                                     48.0%   American                                   34.4%   Air Wisconsin                               3.8%   Delta                                       3.2%   Northwest                                   3.2%                                                                                                                           Dallas/Fort Worth                                                                                                          American                                   63.9%   Delta                                      28.8%   Continental                                 1.3%   United                                      1.2%   Northwest                                   1.0%   Other                                       3.8%                                                                                                                          Minneapolis/St. Paul                                                                                                          Northwest                                  79.5%   United                                      4.6%   American                                    3.1%   Delta                                       3.1%   Continental                                 2.6%   Other                                       7.1%                                                                                                                              Pittsburgh                                                                                                          USAir*                                     87.8%   American                                    3.0%   Delta                                       2.3%   United                                      1.6%   TWA                                         1.2%   Other                                       4.1%                                                                                                          *Includes Piedmont</TEXT></DOC>
