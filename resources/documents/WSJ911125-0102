Legalized gambling started in Cripple Creek, Black Hawkand Central City Oct. 1.</LP><TEXT>   In August, the state Division of Gaming projected thestate would collect $181,000 from the first month ofgambling. Revenue collected was $495,753, the division said.   But, the gambling division and casino owners warned thatthe October results don't indicate how well the casinos willdo in the future. The nearly yearlong process of setting upgambling in the towns caused a great deal of pent-up demandand anticipation that wore off after the first month, saidDavid Wahl, chairman of the gambling owners' association.&quot;We've seen the toe of an animal. Everybody thinks it's anelephant, but it might be a rabbit,&quot; he said.   Business in November was considerably slower than it wasin October, Mr. Wahl said, partly because of heavy snows andnews forecasts of bad weather.   The average amount of money collected from each gamblingdevice in the state was $219.27 a day. The state's 21 casinosoperated 1,920 devices in October, all but 31 were slotmachines. All devices weren't in operation for the entiremonth.</TEXT></DOC>
