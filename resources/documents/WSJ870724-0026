In the year-earlier quarter, the bank holding company earned $8.8 million, or 17 cents a share.    Regarding the reserve addition, the company said its agreement to be acquired by Marine Midland Banks Inc., New York, was amended to account for the reserve's impact on earnings. As previously reported, the banks agreed to merge after March 4, 1990, when interstate banking laws take effect. Marine Midland is 52%-owned by Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp., which has bid for the remainder it doesn't own.    Under the amended transaction, the unused portion of First Pennsylvania's reserve addition will be returned to cumulative consolidated pre-tax earnings when determining whether First Pennsylvania has met required earnings criteria. First Pennsylvania said the merger price will remain $11 a share plus two times the increase in its adjusted retained earnings.    For the six months, First Pennsylvania had net loss of $79.2 million, compared with net income of $16.6 million, or 30 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
