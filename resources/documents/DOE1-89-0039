Evidently, the level of hydrocarbonpotential is controlled by differences in the size and history of thezone of petroleum generation. This conclusion was originally drawn fromhistorical methods applied to various basins. To refine the conclusionsand define the significance of the individual factors controlling hydrocarbongeneration, it is of interest to examine the petroleum potential fora fairly extensive system. Here the authors consider the Morocco basin,in the passive-margin basin system of the East Atlantic, which has veryscanty oil and gas reserves. The proven reserves at the start of 1978were only 20.55 million metric tons of oil and 1.2 billion m{sup 3} ofgas. 16 references.</TEXT></DOC>
