It amends the Privacy Act of 1974 to add certain protectionsfor the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automatedmatching programs. These protections are essentially threefold:andbullet; <T3>Procedural uniformity: </T3>In carrying out matching programs, agenciesare required to comply with the specific procedures the Act sets out; andbullet; <T3>Due process for subjects: </T3>The Act gives individuals certain dueprocess rights including advance notice that their records may be matched,notice of any adverse data found, and a chance to rebut this evidence;andbullet; <T3>Oversight of matching: </T3>The Act establishes oversight mechanismsto ensure agency compliance. These include reports to OMB and Congress,publication of notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and the establishment of Data Integrity Boardsat each agency engaging in matching to monitor the agency's matching activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Act goes into effect 9 months after it became law, or July 19,1989. Public Law 100-503 requires OMB to ``develop guidelines and regulationsfor the use of agencies in implementing the amendments made by this Actnot later than 8 months after the date of enactment * * *,'' or June 19,1989. The proposed guidance that follows is intended to meet this requirementand will, in final form, replace previous guidance OMB issued on May 2,1982 (see 47 FR 21656). One of the forces driving the Privacy Act of 1974 into existence was Congressionalconcern about the government's use of computers in which to keep recordsabout individuals. The Act's preamble points to the possibility of automatedrecordkeeping ``greatly magnifying'' the potential harm to record subjects.In reality, in the era in which the Act was implemented, most Federal recordswere kept on paper and stored in file cabinets. Now, however, due to the steady automation of government programs, automatedrecords play a much more significant and more pervasive role in Federalrecordkeeping. It is apparent that the structure of the Privacy Act isstraining to accommodate this kind of recordkeeping. Public Law 100-503is the first amendment of the Privacy Act to attempt to deal with the issueof automated records, albeit in only one area: computer matching. However,because it amends the Privacy Act without changing that Act's basic structure,there are real questions about how the Privacy Act's provisions, especiallythe definitions, should be interpreted. Thus, OMB is especially interested in obtaining comments on the followingpoints: andbullet; <T3>What constitutes a matching program within the meaning of the ComputerMatching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988? </T3>The Act defines a matchingprogram as ``any computerized comparison of [either] two or more automatedsystems of records or a system of records with non-Federal records.'' Asthe Guidelines interpret this definition, the following would be examplesof covered matching programs for the reasons given: <ITAG tagnum="15">_The Department of Education sends a tape of student loan defaultorsto the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which then performs an automatedmatch against its Federal employee data base to identify and locate Federalemployees who have defaulted on loans. This is a covered match becauseit involves the automated comparison of two automated systems of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A clerk employed by a State agency enters data about an applicantfor a Federal benefit program into an automated data base. At the end ofthe day, the State agency forwards the tape to a Federal agency which runsthe tape against an automated system of records containing informationabout individuals who have defaulted on a Federal obligation. The purposeof the match is to identify applicants who are ineligible for the benefitbecause of their previous default. This is a covered match because it involvesan automated comparison of non-Federal records with a Federal system ofrecords.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A clerk employed by a State agency sends a paper listing containinginformation about applicants for a Federal benefit program to the Officeof Personnel Management to determine whether any applicants are Federalemployees whose salaries would render them ineligible. The OPM makes acomputerized comparison of this list with its automated Federal employeesystem of records. This is a match because it involves the automated comparisonof non-Federal records with a system of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A State benefit program clerk directly accesses a federal systemof records and enters data into it from an applicant's form to make aneligibility determination. This is a covered match because it is an automatedcomparison of non-Federal records with a Federal system of records.</ITAG>The following are situations where the Act's reach is less clear:<ITAG tagnum="15">_A State benefit clerk accesses a Federal system of records and entersinformation received orally from an applicant in order to perform an immediateeligiblity check. In this case, there appear to be no records involvedat the State end, and yet the situation is essentially the same as theone described immediately above where the clerk enters data from an applicant'sform.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">OBM invites comments about whether this kind of access should be coveredand under what theory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A Federal agency maintaining a paper record system of records sendsa listing from that system to another Federal agency. The recipient agencyautomates the listing and performs a computerized comparison with its ownautomated system of records containing information about a Federal benefitprogram. The wording of the Act suggests that this would not be a coveredmatch since only one Federal automated system of records is involved.</ITAG>OMB specifically solicits comments on whether the automation of a paperlisting and subsequent automated comparison should be covered under theAct and under what theory of coverage.  andbullet; <T3>What routine administrative matches using Federal employee recordsshould be excluded from the Act's coverage?</T3> The act permits OMB toidentify examples of routine administrative matches for which agenciesneed not meet the requirements of the Matching Act. The guidelines lista few examples of such matches. OMB is interested in obtaining a broaderrange of examples to include and invites commentators to submit candidates. andbullet; <T3>When should Data Integrity Boards be permitted to waive the benefit-costrequirement?</T3> The Computer Matching Act permits Data Integrity Boardsto waive the requirement that a benefit-cost analysis be done, as wellas the requirement that matches may proceed only when analysis producesa favorable benefit-cost ratio. Waivers in these circumstances are to besubject to guidance from OMB. The Guidelines discuss this issue generally,but OMB would welcome commentaters' advice on this subject, including relevantexamples.  <ITAG tagnum="6">Jay Plager,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on the Conduct of MatchingPrograms  </ITAG>1. <T3>Purpose:</T3> These Guidelines augment and should be used with the``Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines on the Administrationof the Privacy Act of 1974,'' issued on July 1, 1975, and supplementedon November 21, 1975, and Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, publishedon December 24, 1985, (see 50 FR at 52738). They are intended to help agenciesrelate the procedural requirements of the Privacy Act (as amended by Pub.L. 100-503, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988_hereinafterreferred to as the Computer Matching Act), with the operational requirementsof automated matching programs. These are policy guidelines applicableto the extent permitted by law. They do not authorize activities that arenot permitted by law; nor do they prohibit activities expressly requiredto be performed by law. Complying with these Guidelines, nonetheless, doesnot relieve a Federal agency of the obligation to comply with the provisionsof the Privacy Act, including any provisions not cited in these Guidelines. 2. <T3>Authority:</T3> Section 6 of Pub. L. 100-503, The Computer Matchingand Privacy Protection Act of 1988, requires OMB to issue implementationguidance on the Amendments.  3. <T3>Scope:</T3> These guidelines apply primarily to all Federal agencysubject to the Privacy Act of 1974. For this purpose, the Privacy Act reliesupon the definition in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. 552at (e): ``any executive department, military department, government corporation,government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executivebranch of the government (including the Executive Office of the President),or any independent regulatory agency.'' For the purposes of these guidelines,components Departments, e.g., the Health Care Financing Administrationof the Department of Health and Human Services, are <T3>not</T3> considered individual agencies.  Note that the definition incorporates the ``agency'' definition used inthe Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 at (1)) which also containsa series of categories that are not covered, including State and localgovernments.  The Computer Matching Act amendment, however, brings State and local governmentswithin the ambit of the Privacy Act when they are engaging in certain typesof matching activities; <T3>but only in conjunction with a Federal agency that is itself subjectto the Privacy Act, and only when a Federal system of records is involvedin the match</T3>.  In general, a State or local agency or agent thereof, that is either (1)providing records to a Federal agency for use in a matching program coveredby the Act; or (2) receiving records from a Federal agency's system ofrecords for use in a matching program covered by the Act, must comply withcertain of the Act's provisions. What State and local governments mustdo to meet the requirements of the Act is explained in paragraph 9 below. 4. <T3>Effective Date:</T3> These guidelines will be effective on the dateof issuance in final form.  5. <T3>Definitions:</T3> The Computer Matching Act is an amendment of thePrivacy Act of 1974 and the provisions of the former should be read withinthe context of the latter, and all the terms originally defined in thePrivacy Act of 1974 apply.  It is especially important to note that the Computer Matching Act doesnot extend Privacy Act coverage to those not originally included. Thus,the subjects of Federal systems of records covered by the Computer MatchingAct are ``individuals,'' i.e., U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admittedfor permanent residence.  Two definitions that are especially relevant to matching programs are: _``<T3>Record</T3>'' which the Privacy Act defines as an item of informationabout an individual, including his or her name or some other identifier;and,  _``<T3>System of Records</T3>'' which is a collection of such ``records''from which an agency retrieves information by reference to an individualidentifier.  In addition, the Computer Matching Act provides the following new terms: a. <T3>Matching Program.</T3> At its simplest, a matching program is the comparisonof records using a computer. The records must themselves exist in automatedform (or be put in automated form in order to perform the match). Manualcomparisons of, for example, printouts of two automated data bases, are<T3>not</T3> included within this definition.  The Computer Matching Act covers two kinds of matching programs: (1) matchesinvolving Federal benefits programs and, (2) matches using records fromFederal personnel or payroll systems of records.     (1) <T3>Federal Benefits Matches.</T3> The Act defines a Federal benefits matchingprogram as: <ITAG tagnum="25">``any computerized comparison of two or more automated systems ofrecords, or a system of records with non-Federal records, by applicantsfor, recipients or beneficiaries of, participants in, or providers of serviceswith respect to, cash or in-kind assistance or payments under Federal benefitprograms * * * [i.e., any program administered or funded by the Federalgovernment, providing cash or in-kind assistance in the form of payments,grants, loans, or loan guarantees to individuals], * * * for the purposeof establishing or verifying the eligibility of or continuing compliancewith statutory and regulatory requirements, or [for the purposes of] recoupingpayments or delinquent debts under such Federal benefits programs.'' (See5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(8) and (12).) </ITAG>The elements of this definition are discussed below:  (a) <T3>Computerized Comparison of Data.</T3> The record comparison must bea computerized comparison involving records from:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_Two or more automated systems of records (i.e., systems of recordsmaintained by Federal agencies that are subject to the Privacy Act); or, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A Federal agency's system of records (whether automated or not) andrecords maintained by a non-Federal (i.e., State or local government) agency(whether automated or not). To be covered, </ITAG><T3>matches</T3> of these records <T3>must be computerized</T3>.  (b) <T3>Categories of Subjects Covered.</T3> The Computer Matching Act provisionscover only the following categories of record subjects:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_Applicants for Federal benefit programs (i.e., individuals initiallyapplying for benefits);  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Program beneficiaries (i.e., individual program participants whoare actually receiving benefits);  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Providers of services to support such programs (i.e., those who arenot the primary beneficiaries of Federal benefits programs, but may deriveincome from them_health care providers, for example).  </ITAG>(c) <T3>Types of Programs Covered.</T3> Only Federal benefit programs providingcash or in-kind assistance to individuals are covered by this definition.State programs are not covered. Federal programs not involving cash orin-kind assistance are not covered. Programs using records about subjectswho are not individuals as defined by section (a)(2) of the Privacy Act_U.S.citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence_are not covered. (d) <T3>Matching Purpose.</T3> The match must have as its purpose:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Establishing or verifying initial or continuing eligibility for Federalbenefit programs; or,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Verifying compliance with the requirements_either statutory or regulatory_ofsuch programs; or,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Recouping payments or delinquent debts under such Federal benefitprograms.</ITAG>It should be noted that all four of these elements must be present beforea matching program is covered under the provisions of the Computer MatchingAct. Thus, for example, if the Department of Education matched a studentloan recipient data base with a Veterans Administration (VA) educationalbenefit recipient data base for the purpose of ensuring that both agencieswere maintaining the most current and accurate home address information,that would not be covered since the ``matching purpose'' is not one ofthe three enumerated above. If, however, the purpose of the match wereto identify recipients who were receiving benefits in excess of those towhich they were entitled, the match would be covered.  Moreover, elements that are peripheral to the match, even if within thedefinitions above will not raise a match to the Act's coverage. For example,the Federal Parent Locator Service conducts matches to locate absenteeparents who are not paying child support. Such matches may result in theidentified spouse being ordered to commence payments, and some of thosepayments may go to recoup payments made from a Federal benefit programsuch as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Because the recoupmentis not the primary purpose of the match, but only an incidental consequence,such matches would not be covered.  (2) <T3>Federal Personnel or Payroll Records Matches.</T3> The Computer MatchingAct also includes matches comparing records from Federal personnel or payrollsystems of records, or such records and records of State and local governments.Again, it should be noted that regardless of whether the records are automated,the comparison must be done by using a computer; manual comparisons arenot covered. Matches in this category must be done for other than ``routineadministrative purposes'' as defined in paragraph 5a(3)(e) below. In someinstances, a covered match may take place within a single agency. For example,an agency may wish to determine whether any of its own personnel are participatingin a benefit program administered by the agency, and are not in compliancewith the program's eligibility requirements. This internal match will certainlyresult in an adverse action if ineligibility is discovered. Therefore,it is covered by the requirements of the Computer Matching Act.  (3) <T3>Exclusions from the Definition of a Matching Program.</T3> The followingare not included under the definition of matching programs. Agencies operatingsuch programs are not required to comply with the provisions of the ComputerMatching Act, although they may be required to comply with any other applicableprovisions of the Privacy Act.  (a) <T3>Statistical Matches Whose Purpose is Solely to Produce Aggregate DataStripped of Personal Identifiers.</T3> This does not mean that the databases used in the match must be stripped prior to the match, but only thatthe results of the match must not contain individually identifiable data.Implicit in this exception is that this kind of match is not done to takeaction against specific individuals; although, it is possible that thestatistical inferences drawn from the data may have consequences for thesubjects of the match as members of a class or group. For example, a continuingmatching program that shows one geographical area consistently experiencinga higher default rate than others may result in a more rigorous scrutinyof applicants from that area, but would not be a covered matching program. (b) <T3>Statistical Matches Whose Purpose is in Support of Any Research orStatistical Project.</T3> The results of these matches need not be strippedof identifiers, but they must not be used to make decisions that affectthe rights, benefits or privileges of <T3>specific</T3> individuals. Again, it should be noted that this provisionis not intended to prohibit using any data developed in these matches tomake decisions about a Federal benefit program in general that may ultimatelyaffect beneficiaries. This exclusion could also cover so-called ``pilotmatches,'' i.e., small scale matches whose purpose is to gather benefit/costdata on which to premise a decision about engaging in a full-fledged matchingprogram. Of course, if agencies used any of the information obtained tomake an adverse determination, they would be required to meet the fullrequirements for indepedent verification and notice and opportunity torefute that apply to covered matching programs.  (c) <T3>Law Enforcement Investigative Matches Whose Purpose is to Gather EvidenceAgainst a Named Person or Persons in an Existing Investigation.</T3> Certainmatches performed in support of civil or criminal law enforcement activitiesthat otherwise would be covered because they seek to establish or verifyFederal benefit eligibility or use of Federal personnel or payroll records,are excluded from coverage by this section. To be eligible for exclusion,the match must be done by an agency or component whose principal functioninvolves the enforcement of <T3>criminal</T3> laws, i.e., an agency that is eligible to exempt certainof its record sytems under section (j)(2) of the Privacy Act. Thus, anagency that is not itself <T3>principally</T3> a criminal law enforcement agency, such as the Departmentof Justice, may have one or more components, e.g., the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation or the Drug Enforcement Administration, that are.  The match must flow from an investigation already underway which focuseson a specific person or persons; ``fishing expeditions'' in which the subjectsare identified generically as ``program beneficiaries,'' are not eligiblefor this exclusion (note that the investigation may be into either criminalor civil law violations). The use of the phrase ``person or persons'' inthis context broadens the exclusion to include subjects that are otherthan ``individuals'' as defined by the Privacy Act. Thus, for example abusiness entity could be the named subject of the investigation, whilethe records matched could be those of customers or clients. This does notmean however, that the rights afforded by the Privacy Act are extendedby this section to other than ``individuals.''  Finally, the match must be for the purpose of gathering evidence againstthe named person or persons.  (d) <T3>Tax Administration Matches.</T3> There are four specific categoricalexclusions for matches using ``tax information.'' While that term is notdefined in the Computer Matching Act, the Report accompanying the Houseversion of the Act, H.R. 4699, cites ``tax returns'' and ``tax return information''as the tax information that is covered by the exclusion. Those terms aredefined in section 6103 of Title 26 U.S.C. at (b)(1)-(b)(3). It is clearfrom these sections that the information covered is under the control ofthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the Department of the Treasury sincethe definitions speak of information that is ``filed with the Secretary''or ``received by, prepared by, furnished to, or collected by the Secretary.''Moreover, section 6103(a) prohibits Federal, State and local governmentalemployees from disclosing tax information except as authorized by the InternalRevenue Code. This is not to say that all information in the possessionof the IRS is covered by the exclusion; only tax information. Thus, forexample, personnel records relating to the management of the IRS workforcewould not be covered.  The exclusion covers the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Matches done pursuant to section 6103(d) of the Tax Code. These matchesinvolve disclosures of taxpayer return information to State tax officials.For matches covered by this exclusion, neither the Federal disclosing entitynor the State recipient need comply with the provisions of the ComputerMatching Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Matches done for the purposes of ``tax adminstration'' as that termis defined in section 6103(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code: ``The term`tax administration' means the administration, management, conduct, direction,and supervision of the execution and application of the internal revenuelaws or related statutes (or equivalent laws and statutes of a State) andtax conventions to which the United States is a party; and the developmentand formulation of Federal tax policy relating to existing or proposedinternal revenue law, related statutes, and tax conventions; and includesassessment, collection, enforcement, litigation, publication, and statisticalgathering functions under such laws, statutes or conventions.'' While thisdefintion is very broad and covers a great deal of discretionary activitieson the part of IRS management, it is not intended to exempt all IRS activitiesfrom the Act's coverage; only those that truly relate to administrationof the nation's tax system (as opposed to management of the IRS workforce,for example). Thus, the exclusion will permit the IRS to continue to matchtax returns with interest and dividend statements, for example.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Tax refund offset matches done pursuant to the deficit ReductionAct of 1984 (DEFRA). That Act amended sections 464 and 1137 of the SocialSecurity Act and the procedures for affording matching subjects due processare contained in those sections.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Tax refund offset matches conducted pursuant to statutes other thanthe DEFRA provided OMB finds the due process provisions of those statutes``substantially similar'' to those of the DEFRA. A list of such programsis contained in Attachment 1 to this guidance. OMB will amend this listas necessary to keep it current with existing legislation. Agencies shouldnotify OMB promptly when they think an existing statute provides an exemptionin this category.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Routine Administrative Matches Using Federal Personnel Records. </T3>Theseare matches between a Federal agency and other Federal agencies or betweena Federal agency and non-Federal agencies for administrative purposes thatuse data bases that contain records predominantly relating to Federal personnel.The term ``federal personnel'' is defined by the Act as: ``officers andemployees of the Government of the United States, members of the uniformedservices (including members of the Reserve components), individuals entitledto receive immediate or deferred retirement benefits under any retirementprogram of the Government of the United States (including survivor benefits).''Matches whose purpose is to take ``any adverse financial, personnel, disciplinaryor other adverse action against Federal personnel * * *'' whose recordsare involved in the match, are not excluded from the Act's coverage.Examples of matches that are excluded include an agency's disclosure oftime and attendance information on all agency employees to the Departmentof the Treasury in order to prepare the agency's payroll; or disclosureof Department of Defense (DoD) Reserve Officer identifying informationto a State in order to validate and update addresses of Reservists residingin the State.Note that this exclusion does not bring under the Act's coverage matchesthat <T3>may </T3>ultimately result in an adverse action. It only requires thattheir purpose not be intended to result in an adverse action. Thus, inthe DoD/State reservist match example, the consequence of the match maywell be that a reservist is dropped from the program because no addresscan be found for him or her. This result, however, negative, would notbring the match under the Act's coverage since its primary purpose wasonly to update an address listing.(f) <T3>Internal Agency Matches Using Only Records From the Agency's Systemof Records. </T3>Internal agency matching is excluded on the same basisas Federal personnel record matching above: provided no adverse intentas to a Federal employee motivates the match. Section (b)(1) of the PrivacyAct permits agencies to disseminate Privacy Act records to agency employeeson an official need-to-know basis. This exclusionary provision does notdisturb that principle, except where Federal personnel records are involved.Thus, for example, the Social Security Administration could match withthe Health Care Financing Administration to detect and ultimately recoupoverpayments for a specific Department of Health and Human Services program.That match would not be covered by the provisions on the Computer MatchingAct.Moreover, the mere presence of Federal employee records in the data basesbeing matched would not necessarily bring the match under the Act's coverage.To be covered, the records would have to be predominantly those relatingto Federal employees_a personnel system of records, for example_and theprimary intent would have to be to take an adverse action of some kindagainst the Federal employees specifically. If the Department of Educationmatched its student loan defaulter file against its own employee data basein order to detect and take action against Education employees who havedefaulted, that match would be covered by the Act. The same departmentmatching its undergraduate student loan defaulter file against its medicalschool loan defaulter file in order to determine the incidence of repeatdefaulters, would not be covered, even though some of those in the database might be Federal employees.(g) <T3>Background Investigation and Foreign Counter-intelligence Matches.</T3>Matches done in the course of performing a background check for securityclearances of Federal personnel or Federal contractor personnel are notcovered. Nor are matches done for the purpose of foreign counter-intellgience.b. <T3>Recipient Agency. </T3>Recipient agencies are Federal agencies (ortheir contractors) that receive records from the Privacy Act systems ofrecords of other Federal agencies or from State and local governments tobe used in matching programs.c. <T3>Source Agency. </T3>A source agency is a Federal agency that disclosesrecords from a system of records to another Federal agency or to a Stateor local governmental agency to be used in a matching program. It is alsoa State or local governmental agency that discloses records to a Federalagency to be used in a matching program. The Computer Matching Act doesnot cover matching between non-Federal entities.d. <T3>Non-Federal Agency. </T3>A non-Federal agency is a State or local governmentalagency that receives records contained in a system of records from a Federalagency to be used in a matching program. e. <T3>Federal Benefit Program. </T3>See paragraph 5a(1)(r) above.6. <T3>Conducting Matching Programs: </T3>The following applies to Federalagencies. Requirements pertaining to non-Federal agencies are in paragraph9 below.Agencies undertaking matching programs covered by the Computer MatchingAct will need to make sure that they comply with the following requirements:a. <T3>Prior Notice to Record Subjects. </T3>There are two ways in which recordsubjects can receive notice that their records may be matched:<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>By direct notice </T3>when there is some form of contact between thegovernment and the subject, e.g., information on the application form whenthey apply for a benefit or in a notice that arrives that a benefit thatthey receive;<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>By constructive notice, </T3>e.g., publication of systems notices,routine use disclosures, and matching programs in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>For front-end eligibility verification programs whose purpose is to validatean applicant's initial eligibility for a benefit and later to determinecontinued eligibility, agencies should provide direct notice by amendingthe application form where necessary to enlarge the statement providedpursuant to section (e)(3) of the Privacy Act so that applications areput on notice that the information they provide may be verified througha computer match. Agencies should also provide periodic notice wheneverthe application is renewed, or at the least, during the period the matchis authorized to take place, in a notice accompanying the benefit. Providersof services should be given notice on the form on which they apply forreimbursement for services provided.In some cases, constructive notice may have to suffice. For example, aFederal agency that discloses records to a State or local government insupport of a non-Federal matching program is not obligated to provide actualnotice to each of the record subjects; <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication in this instance is sufficient. Moreover,in some instances, it may be possible to provide actual notice_in matchesdone to locate individuals, in emergency situations where health and safetyreasons argue for a swift completion of the match; or in investigativematches where direct notice immediately prior to a match would providethe subject an opportunity to alter behavior.  In any case, notice to the record subject should be done well before amatching program commences. It should be part of the normal process ofimplementing a Federal benefits program.  b. <T3>Matching Notices_Publication Requirements. </T3>Agencies must publishnotices of the establishment or alteration of matching programs in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> at least 30 days prior to conducting such programs.The recipient Federal agency in a match between Federal agencies or ina match in which a non-Federal agency discloses records to a Federal agencyis responsible for publishing such notices. Where a State or local agencyis the recipient of records from a Federal agency's system of records,the Federal source agency is responsible for publishing such notices. Wherea State or local agency is the recipient of records from a Federal agency'ssystem of records, the Federal source agency is responsible for publishingthe notice. Where more than one agency is involved in a matching program,agencies are encouraged to publish a consolidated notice. Such noticesshould contain the following information:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_Name of participating agency or agencies;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Purpose of the match;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Authority for conducting the matching program. (It should be notedthat the Computer Matching Act provides no independent authority for carryingout any matching activity);  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Categories of records and individuals covered;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Inclusive dates of the matching program;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Address for receipt of public comments or inquiries.  </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Copies of proposed matching notices must accompany reports of proposedmatches submitted pursuant to section (r) of the Privacy Act as amended.See OMB Circular No. A-130, Appendix I, as amended.  c. <T3>Preparing and Executing Matching Agreements. </T3>Agencies should allowsufficient lead time to ensure that matching agreements can be negotiatedand signed in time to secure Data Integrity Board decisions. Federal agenciesreceiving records from or disclosing records to non-Federal agencies foruse in matching programs are responsible for preparing the matching agreementsand should solicit relevant data from non-Federal agencies were necessary.In cases where matching takes place entirely within an agency under theFederal personnel or payroll matching provisions, the agency may satisfythe matching agreement requirements by preparing a Memorandum of Understandingbetween the system of records managers involved, and presenting that tothe Data Integrity Board for consideration.  Agreements must contain the following:  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Purpose and Legal Authority. </T3>Since the Computer Matching Act providesno independent authority for the operation of matching programs, agenciesshould cite a specific Federal or State statutory or regulatory basis forundertaking such programs.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Justification and Expected Results.</T3> An explanation of why computermatching as opposed to some other administrative activity is being proposedand what the expected results will be.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Description.</T3> An identification of the system of recordsor non-Federal records, the number of records, and what data elements willbe included in the match. Projected starting and completion dates for theprogram should also be provided.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Notice Procedures. </T3>A description of the individual and generalperiodic notice procedures. See paragraph 6.a., above.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Verification Procedures. </T3>A description of the methods the agencywill use to independently verify the information obtained through the matchingprogram. See paragraph 6.f., below.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Disposition of Matched Items. </T3>A statement that information generatedthrough the match, will be destroyed as soon as it has served the matchingprogram's purpose and any legal retention requirements the agency establishesin conjunction with the National Archives and Records Administration orother cognizant authority.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Security Procedures. </T3>A description of the administrative and technicalsafeguards to be used in protecting the information. They should be commensuratewith the level of sensitivity of the data.  <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Usage, Duplication and Redisclosure Restrictions. </T3>A descriptionof any specific restrictions imposed by either the source agency or bystatute or regulation on collateral uses of the records used in the matchingprogram. In general, recipient agencies should not put the records obtainedfor a matching program and under the terms of a matching agreement to otheruses absent a specific statutory requirement, or where there is a directconnection to the conduct of the matching program. The agreement shouldspecify how long a recipient agency may keep records provided for a matchingprogram, and when they will be returned to the source agency or destroyed. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Records Accuracy Assessments. </T3>Any information relating to thequality of the records to be used in the matching program. Record accuracyis important from two standpoints. In the first case, the worse the qualityof the data, the less likely a matching program will have a cost-beneficialresult. In the second case, the Privacy Act requires Federal agencies tomaintain records they maintain in systems of records to a standard of accuracythat will reasonably assure fairness in any determination made on the basisof the record. Thus an agency receiving records from another Federal agencyor from a non-Federal agency needs to know information about the accuracyof such records in order to comply with the law. Moreover, the PrivacyAct also requires agencies to take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracyof records that are disclosed to non-Federal recipients.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Comptroller General Access.</T3> A statement that the Comptroller Generalmay have access to all records of a recipient agency or non-Federal agencynecessary to monitor or verify compliance with the agreement. It shouldbe understood that this requirement permits the Comptroller General toinspect State and local records used in matching programs covered by theseagreements.d. <T3>Securing Approval of Data Integrity Boards.</T3> Before an agency mayparticipate in a matching program, the agency's Data Integrity Board musthave evaluated the proposed match and approved the terms of the matchingagreement. (See paragraph 7.d. below, for appeals of Board disapprovals).e. <T3>Reports to OMB and Congress.</T3> See OMB Circular No. A-130, AppendixI as amended. f. <T3>Providing Due Process to Matching Subjects.</T3> The Computer MatchingAct prescribes certain due process requirements that the subjects of matchingprograms must be afforded when matches uncover adverse information aboutthem.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Verification of Adverse Information.</T3> Agencies may not premiseadverse action upon the raw results of a computer match. Any adverse informationso developed must be subjected to investigation and verification beforeaction is taken. In many cases, the individual record subject is the bestsource for determining a finding's validity, and he or she should be contactedwhere practicable. In other cases, the payer of a benefit will have themost accurate record relating to payment and should be contacted for verification.Note that, in some cases, contacting the subject initially may permit himor her to conceal data relevant to a decision; and, in those cases, anagency may elect to examine other sources. Absolute confirmation is notrequired; a reasonable verification process that yields confirmatory datawill provide the agency with a reasonable basis for taking action.As to applicants for Federal benefits programs whose eligibility is beingverified through a matching program, agencies may not make a final determinationuntil they have completed the due process steps the Act requires. Thisdoes not mean, however, that they are required to place an applicant onthe rolls pending a determination, but only that they may not make a finaldecision. For matching subjects receiving benefits, however, agencies may not suspendor reduce payments until the due process steps have been completed.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Notice and Opportunity to Contest.</T3> Agencies are required to notifymatching subjects of adverse information uncovered and given them an opportunityto explain prior to making a final determination. Again, this does notmean that an applicant must be put on the rolls pending his or her explanation,but only that the agency may not make a final determination. Current benefitsrecipients, however, may not have those benefits suspended or reduced pendingthe expiration of this period. Individuals may have at least 30 days to respond to a notice of adverseaction. The period runs from the date of the notice until 35 calendar dayslater. The 5 extra days are intended to cover transit time. If an individual contacts the agency within the notice period and indicateshis or her acceptance of the validity of the adverse information, agenciesmay take immediate action to deny or terminate. Agencies may also takeaction if the period expires without contact. If the Federal benefit program involved in the match has its own due processrequirements, those requirements may suffice for the purposes of the ComputerMatching Act, provided they are at least as strong as that Act's provisions.In any case, if an agency determines that there is likely to be a potentiallysignificant effect on public health or safety, it may take appropriateaction, notwithstanding these due process provisions. 7. <T3>Establishing Data Integrity Boards:</T3> The Computer Matching Actrequires that each Federal agency that acts as either a source or recipientin a matching program, establish a Data Integrity Board to oversee theagency's participation. It should be noted that the fact that records aboutan agency's personnel are used in a matching program does not automaticallytrigger this requirement. Because, for example, the Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) asserts governmentwide ownership of the system of recordscontaining the Federal employee Official Personnel Folder (OPF), disclosuresfrom this system of records involve OPM, not the employing agency. Thereare many small agencies that will never directly disclose records fromtheir own systems of records for matching purposes and they are thus notrequired to establish Data Integrity Boards. a. <T3>Location and Staffing.</T3> While the Act specifies neither the organizationallevel at which the Boards are to be established, nor their makeup (withtwo exceptions), it is clear from the context of the Data Integrity Boardsection that Congress expected agencies to place the Boards at the topof the organization and staff them with senior personnel. It is the intentof these guidelines not to dictate a specific structure but to suggestways of complying with this expectation. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Location.</T3> As to location, because the Boards are to serve a coordinatingfunction, it would be inappropriate to locate them at other than the departmentallevel (or its agency equivalent). This is not to say that subordinate boardsat component levels may not be useful to do the preliminary work necessaryto provide a matching program proposal to the senior Board for approval.Indeed, in large agencies with many matching programs, this will likelybe the rule. But, the approval should come from the top, and this arguesfor the placement suggested above. <ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Staffing.</T3> The Act requires that the Board consist of senior agencyofficials designated by the agency head. The only two mandatory membersare the Inspector General of the agency (if any) who may not serve as Chairman,and the senior official responsible for the implementation of the PrivacyAct who has been designated pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(b). OMB recommendsthat the agency Privacy Act Officer be designated as the Board's Secretary.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Operation.</T3> While much of the work of the Board may be delegatedto less senior members_for example, the compilation of reports, advisingof program officials, and maintaining and disseminating information aboutthe accuracy and reliability of data used in matching_the approval of matchingagreements should not be delegated.The Board should meet often enough to ensure that agency matching programsare carried out efficiently, expeditiously and in conformance with thePrivacy Act, as amended. b. <T3>Review Responsibilities.</T3> Because matching agreements are key tothe implementation of the Computer Matching Act, the Act makes their reviewthe foremost responsibility of the Boards. Boards are responsible for approvingor disapproving matching programs based upon their assessment of the adequacyof these agreements. They should ensure that their reasons for either approvingor denying are well documented. Agency officials proposing matching programsshould ensure that they provide the Data Integrity Board with all of theinformation relevant and necessary to permit it to make an informed decision,including, where appropriate, a benefit/cost analysis.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Review of Proposals to Conduct or Participate in Matching Programs.</T3>The Board must review the matching agreements that support each proposedmatching program and find them in conformance with the provisions of theComputer Matching Act as well as any other relevant statutes, regulations,or guidelines (see the attached checklist). A matching agreement shouldremain in force for only so long as necessary to accomplish the specificmatching purpose; indeed, it automatically expires at the end of 18 monthsunless 3 months prior to the actual expiration date, the Data IntegrityBoard finds that the program will be conducted without change and eachparty certifies that the program has been conducted in compliance withthe matching agreement. Under this finding, the Board may extend the agreementfor 1 additional year. <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>Annual Review.</T3> The Act requires Data Integrity Boards to conductan annual review of all matching programs in which the agency has participatedas either a source or recipient agency. This review has two focuses: todetermine whether the matches have been, or are being, conducted in accordancewith the appropriate authorities and under the terms of the matching agreements;and, to assess the utility of the programs in terms of their costs andbenefits. The Act suggests that this latter review as it pertains to recurringprograms, should result in a basis for continuing participation in, oroperation of, such programs. The Computer Matching Act also requires theBoards to review annually agency recordkeeping and disposal policies andpractices for conformance with the Act's provisions. These reviews shouldtake place within the context of the annual review referenced above. Inaddition, the Boards may review and report on matching activities not coveredby the Computer Matching Act.c. <T3>Benefit/Cost Analysis.</T3> The Computer Matching Act requires thata benefit/cost analysis be a part of an agency decision to conduct or participatein a matching program. The requirement occurs in two places: in matchingagreements which must include a justification of the proposed match witha ``specific estimate of any savings''; and, in the Data Integrity Boardreview process. The intent of this requirement is not to create a presumption that whenagencies balance individual rights and cost savings, the letter shouldinevitably prevail. Rather, it is to ensure that sound management practicesare followed when agencies use records from Privacy Act systems of recordsin matching programs. Particularly in a time when competition for scarceresources is especially intense, it is not in the government's intereststo engage in matching activities that drain agency resources that couldbe better spent elsewhere. Agencies should use the benefit/cost requirementas an opportunity to reexamine programs and weed out those that produceonly marginal results. While the Act appears to require a favorable benefit/cost ratio as an elementof approval of a matching program, agencies should be cautious about applyingthis interpretation in too literal a fashion. For example, the first yearin which a matching program is conducted may show a dramatic benefit/costratio. However, after it has been conducted on a regular basis (with attendantpublicity), its deterrent effect may result in much less favorable ratios.Elimination of such a program, however, may well result in a return tothe prematch benefit/cost ratio. The agency should consider not only theactual savings attributable to such a program, but the consequences ofabandoning it. For proposed matches without an operational history, benefit/cost analyseswill of necessity be speculative. While they should be based upon the bestdata available, reasonable estimates are acceptable at this stage. Nevertheless,agencies should design their programs so as to ensure the collection ofdata that will permit more accurate assessments to be made. As more andmore data become available, it should be possible to make more informedassumptions about the benefits and costs of matching. Because matching is done for a variety of reasons, not all matching programsare appropriate candidates for benefit/cost analysis. The Computer MatchingAct tacitly recognizes this point by permitting Data Integrity Boards towaive the benefit/cost requirement if they determine in writing that suchan analysis is not required. Indeed, the Act itself supplies one such waiver:if a match is required by statute, the initial review by the Board neednot consider the benefits and costs of the match. However, the Act goeson to require that when the matching agreement is renegotiated, a benefit/costanalysis covering the preceding matches must be done. Note that the Actdoes not require the showing of a favorable ratio for the match to be continued,only that an analysis be done. The intention is to provide Congress withinformation to help it evaluate the effectiveness of statutory matchingrequirements with a view to revising or eliminating them where appropriate.Other examples of matches in which the establishment of a favorable benefit/costratio would be inappropriate are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_A match of a system of records containing information about nursesemployed at VA hospitals with records maintained by State nurse licensingboards to identify VA nurses with ``impaired licenses'', i.e., those whohave had some disciplinary action taken against them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A match whose purpose is to identify and correct erroneous data,e.g., Project Clean Data which was run to correct and eliminate erroneousSocial Security Numbers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Selective Service System matching to identify 18 year olds for draftregistration purposes.</ITAG>d. <T3>Appeals of Denials.</T3> If a Board disapproves a matching agreement,the Computer Matching Act permits any party to the agreement to appealthat disapproval to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.While this literally means that a recipient agency (whether Federal ornon-Federal) could appeal the refusal of a source agency to approve anagreement, the actual results of such cross agency appeals, even if successful,are unlikely to result in the implementation of a matching program sincethe source agency may still properly refuse to disclose the necessary PrivacyAct records. Nothing in the appeal process is intended to result in oneagency being able to force another agency to participate unwillingly ina matching program. Accordingly, OMB will only entertain appeals from senior agency officialswho are parties to a proposed matching agreement that has been disapprovedby the agency's own Data Integrity Board. By senior officials, OMB meansthe Inspector General of an agency or the head of an operating divisioncarrying out the matching program. The appeal should be forwarded to the Director, Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503 within 30 days following the Board's writtendisapproval. The following documentation should accompany the appeal:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Copies of all of the documentation accompanying the initial matchingagreement proposal; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A copy of the Board's disapproval and reasons therefor; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of the match; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Any other information relevant to a decision, e.g., timing considerations,the public interest served by the match, etc. </ITAG>The Director will promptly notify Congress of receipt of an appeal andof his or her decision. A decision to approve a matching agreement willnot be effective until 30 days after it is so reported to Congress. Thedecision of the Director shall be based upon the information submitted.OMB expects that this appeal process will be rarely used. One way to ensureits rarity is for agencies to present only well thought-out and thoroughlydocumented proposals to the Boards for decisions. e. <T3>Information Maintenance and Dissemination Responsibilities. </T3>TheAct anticipates that the Data Integrity Boards will be an information resourceon matching for the agency. Thus, while the full Board may actually conveneonly a few times each year to consider matching program proposals, theAct requires a continuing presence to carry out these additional functions.The Board, therefore, should designate a representative to answer questionson matching both from within the agency and from outside entities. Thispoint of contact should be able to advise on what actions are needed tocomply with the provisions of the Computer Matching Act, and to collectand disseminate information on the quality of the records used in matchingprograms. 8. <T3>General Reporting Requirements: </T3>The reporting requirements ofthe Data Integrity Boards will be contained in OMB Circular No. A-130,Appendix I. Matching reports are to be included in the general PrivacyAct implementation reporting requirements outlined in that Circular. 9. <T3>Specific Responsibilities of Non-Federal Agencies: </T3>It is not theintent of this Act to affect, nor do its provisions reach, State and localgovernments using their own records for matching purposes. Nor does theAct reach State or local matching programs using records from Federal systemsof records for purposes other than those defined in the Act as for a ``matchingprogram.''Thus, for example, a Federal agency could disclose information about beneficiariesof a Federal program to a State agency in order to permit the State toconduct a matching program to determine eligibility for a State publicassistance program. So long as the purpose was to validate eligibilityfor the State as opposed to the Federal benefit program, the Computer MatchingAct would not come into play. If however, the Federal agency disclosed the names and income levels ofits own Federal employees to a State under these circumstances, the matchingrequirements would have to be met since this match would be covered underthe ``Federal employee personnel and payroll'' provisions. Non-Federal agencies intending to participate in covered matching programsare required to do the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Execute matching agreements prepared by a Federal agency or agenciesinvolved in the matching program; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provide data to Federal agencies on the cost and benefits of matchingprograms; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Certify that they will not take adverse action against an individualas a result of any information developed in a matching program unless theinformation has been independently verified and until 30 days after theindividual has been notified of the findings and given an opportunity tocontest them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_For renewals of matching programs, certify that the terms of theagreement have been followed.</ITAG>10. <T3>Sanctions. </T3>The Computer Matching Act specifies that neither aFederal nor a non-Federal agency may disclose a record for use in a matchingprogram if either has reason to believe the recipient is not meeting theterms of the matching agreement or the due process requirements of theComputer Matching Act. This provision does not create an affirmative dutyon the part of a source agency to investigate a recipient agency's levelof compliance. However, if a source agency receives information that wouldlead it to conclude that the recipient agency was not in compliance, itmust consult with that agency before continuing to participate in the matchingprogram. Moreover, it should be noted that the civil remedies provisions of thePrivacy Act are available to matching record subjects who can demonstratethat they have been harmed by an agency's violation of the Privacy Actor its own regulations. A successful litigant is entitled under the PrivacyAct to receive <T3>at least </T3>$1,000 and reasonable attorney's fees. Given the largenumbers of record subjects typically involved in a matching program, agenciesshould be especially diligent in guarding against actions that would createliabilities. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-9353 Filed 4-18-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3110-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
