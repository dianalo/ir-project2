Michael Gartner, in a March 17 op-ed piece, says the AMA &quot;can't have it both ways.&quot; In fact, there is no inconsistency.    The First Amendment at its heart protects the freedom of the press -- including medical journals -- and the expression of ideas -- even repugnant ones such as those expressed in the AMA journal story about an act of euthanasia. If, in the words of Justice Lewis Powell, prosecutors can &quot;annex the news media as an investigative arm of the government,&quot; confidential sources will dry up and important facts and ideas will be hidden from the public (as well as from investigative authorities). That's why the leading national press organizations -- and the Cook County Circuit Court last week -- supported the AMA's motion to quash the subpoena for its source.    But commercial speech -- the peddler selling his product -- historically had no First Amendment protection at all, and the Supreme Court continues to recognize the &quot;common sense distinction&quot; between commercial advertising and other forms of speech. Thus, the Supreme Court last term upheld a ban on gambling advertising in Puerto Rico even though gambling is lawful there, and a federal ban of tobacco advertising likely would be upheld as well. There is no &quot;lawful-to-sell, lawful-to-advertise&quot; principle under the First Amendment. As the court stated in the gambling case, &quot;It is precisely because the government could have enacted a wholesale prohibition of the underlying conduct that it is permissible for the government to take the less intrusive step of allowing the conduct, but reducing the demand through restrictions on advertising. . . .&quot;    In this country's continuing debate about virtually every aspect of health care, the AMA exercises its right to speak out for patients and physicians almost every day. The AMA does not take its First Amendment rights, or anybody else's, casually.    KIRK B. JOHNSON   General Counsel   American Medical Association   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
