Stores have lopped an additional 25% to 50% off prices ofalready marked-down goods. They &quot;must be in bad shape becausethey're giving it away this year,&quot; says Thea Wardell, ateacher from Hempstead, N.Y., who bought a wool suit at SaksFifth Avenue in Manhattan marked down to $180 from $700.   For the first time, Loehmann's, an off-price chain,chopped an extra 40% off its regular markdowns for wintermerchandise at its Northeast stores.   &quot;Stores have resorted to firesale tactics this monthbecause they have more inventory than they want to talkabout,&quot; says Alan Millstein, a retail-industry consultant inNew York.   Many stores had expected a weak Christmas season andordered accordingly, but that wasn't enough to preventproblems. Among the overstocked are J.C. Penney, which atmonth's end will have 2% to 3% more inventory than normal,estimates William Howell, Penney chairman.   Retailers aren't the only ones with high inventories. InNew York, Seventh Avenue apparel makers have stepped up theirshowroom &quot;sample sales,&quot; where shoppers can buy greatlydiscounted excess merchandise.   The deep discounts on leftovers have upstaged ads forresort clothes and swimsuits this winter. &quot;It's hard forstores to concentrate on promoting resort {wear} when theystill have winter merchandise they need to unload,&quot; Mr.Millstein says.                                                                                                          Fantasy Gives Ground   To Midrange Apparel                                                                                                          FASHION magazines have traditionally draped theireditorial pages in fabulous runway couture from New York,Paris and Milan. Now, sprinkled in with those $3,500 Chanelsuits are some mass-market clothes.   Fashion spreads in the January issues of Mademoiselle andGlamour, for example, include a $144 blazer by Evan Picone, a$56 J. Crew sweater and a $58 cardigan from J.C. Penney.   &quot;It's true that we're now committed to using moremedium-priced resources,&quot; says Mademoiselle'seditor-in-chief, Amy Levin Cooper. &quot;Readers aren't lookingfor fantasy anymore,&quot; she says. &quot;They want to see somethingthey can buy.&quot; Besides, she adds, mainstream clothes makegood copy: &quot;The top designers aren't making any big news infashion, so price is a good way to bring something new to thestory.&quot;   Vogue magazine incorporates midpriced clothes largelythrough the secondary collections of top designers, such asDonna Karan's DKNY label, while GQ magazine adds $450business suits to spreads on $2,000 versions and publishesstories on accessories such as ties. &quot;It's no secret that menare buying fewer, less-expensive items,&quot; says Arthur Cooper,GQ's editor-in-chief.   For Liz Claiborne Inc., the top-selling women's apparelbrand in the country, the shift toward picturing moremidpriced merchandise means getting &quot;great editorial play inall the fashion magazines,&quot; including Mirabella and Harper'sBazaar, says Wendy Banks, Claiborne's senior vice presidentof marketing. Any item featured in a fashion spread is a&quot;guaranteed sellout in the stores,&quot; she adds.   But with high-fashion firms continuing to advertiseheavily, fashion magazines aren't about to get carried awaywith the price emphasis. &quot;What the readers often want to knoware the discount stores where they can buy Ralph Lauren . . .and that we won't do,&quot; GQ's Mr. Cooper says.   &quot;Dress for Less,&quot; a syndicated newspaper column, made itsdebut this month. The weekly column pictures a high-fashionoutfit next to a budget look-alike, and includes retailreferrals.                                                                                                          Specialty Shops Chase   Sweet Scent of Success                                                                                                          THEY DON'T have the mystique of a Liz Taylor or a CalvinKlein, but specialty retailers such as Victoria's Secret andTalbots are starting to market their own private-labelfragrances. The retailers were spurred by the million-dollarfragrance hits from such retailers as Giorgio, Bijan andTiffany.   &quot;A fragrance is a great image maker&quot; says Allan Mottus, acosmetics consultant, adding that it can help to keepcustomers loyal to a store. He expects more specialty storesand, especially, catalog companies to add private-labelfragrances in the future.   New entrants will be priced to compete with or undercutdepartment-store cosmetics counters, Mr. Mottus says. &quot;Atdepartment stores, the lowest price for most fragrances is$32, which is too high for most middle-class shoppers,&quot; hesays.   Talbots introduced its &quot;white floral&quot; fragrance inNovember after holding focus groups with more than 1,000customers to &quot;develop a fragrance appropriate for them,&quot; aspokeswoman says.                                                                                                          Odds and End                                                                                                          THE U.S. military's standard-issue pilots' sunglasses, asquare-lens, wire-frame model by Randolph Engineering Co.,Randolph, Mass., have become hot items at PX stores aroundthe country. Randolph plans a radio and print ad campaignfocused on college students around spring break. . . . Flowerpower: Earrings, buttons, jeans and T-shirts with daisies androses are among the most popular items ordered by retailersfor the spring, says Barbara Fields Buying Office,consultants in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
