In the past two months, the Greek leader has proposed a sort of Hellenic free-enterprise zone, then set out to effectively nationalize Greece's biggest foreign-owned company. He has sought to mend fences with Washington, then hinted at leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He has nearly gone to war with Turkey, then indicated he might negotiate with that NATO ally for the first time since he became prime minister.    His saber-rattling at the Turks last month made him a headline hero for a few days. But since then, discontent with his economic policies and unpredictable ways has resurfaced, and many Greeks are wondering whether there was really a crisis anywhere except in his political fortunes.    Swept to power in 1981 on a wave of Greek nationalism and reelected with almost as much fervor in 1985, Mr. Papandreou would have trouble winning an election today, his detractors say. In recent municipal, student and professional elections, his Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, has suffered sizable losses.    Government spokesman Yannis Roubatis brushes aside those setbacks as minor. &quot;The erosion of support is natural&quot; for a six-year-old administration, he says, adding that &quot;we will win the next election.&quot;    That isn't scheduled until 1989 but could be called much earlier. If it is, one of the keenest outside observers of the campaign would be the U.S., which views Mr. Papandreou's threats to close U.S. bases, and his quarrel with Turkey, as a disruption of NATO unity.    Hopes of change were high when Mr. Papandreou took office after seven years of right-wing New Democracy rule. And the government's heavy social spending during its first four years did improve education, hospitals and pensions.    But Pasok made a lot of promises it couldn't keep, such as maintaining a system that links wages to inflation and pulling out of both NATO and the Common Market. &quot;Greek people like fairy tales,&quot; says Nasos Athanasiou, a popular television reporter. &quot;But reality gets in the way.&quot;    The government claims it hasn't abandoned its goals but needs more time to implement them. It rejects much of the criticism directed at it as sour grapes by the opposition New Democracy Party, which has been in disarray since its drubbing in the last election. And Pasok is just as capable as its opponents of using rough language: It routinely denounces New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis as a &quot;nightmare&quot; and a &quot;traitor.&quot;    Still, the government has been in power so long it can't put all the blame for Greece's economic troubles on the conservatives. A two-year wage freeze -- enacted last year after the Common Market threatened to withhold the second half of a $1.8 billion loan -- depressed purchasing power by 8% last year and is expected to cut it a further 10% this year. In a society just getting a taste of prosperity, the fall in the standard of living hurts.    Some economic progress has been made under the government's so-called stabilization program, including a sharply reduced budget deficit and curbed inflation. But the economy continues &quot;in a difficult phase,&quot; the government says. Greece's 300,000 manufacturing enterprises showed combined losses last year. Private investment has shrunk to almost zero.    Disenchantment is also growing with what many consider Mr. Papandreou's autocratic style and his penchant for playing politics with foreign policy.    Despite his ratings decline, the 68-year-old politician still elicits passionate support, partly the legacy of his late father, a crowd-pulling prime minister. No one supposes Mr. Papandreou, widely acknowledged as an astute tactician and compelling orator, will give up easily. &quot;He will do anything to stay in power,&quot; says Virginia Tsouderos, a member of parliament for the centrist Social Democrats.    With that in prospect, Greece looks set for a large dose of Papandreou unpredictability. Says Ionnis Paleokrassas, a former New Democracy economics minister, &quot;In January, Papandreou was a conservative,&quot; taking a hard line on strikers and preaching economic moderation. &quot;In February, he went completely the other way.&quot;    Mr. Papandreou's latest maneuver involves the Greek Orthodox Church, a risky step in a country where the 1,800-year-old religion is revered, if not always heeded. Under new legislation, 350,000 acres of church land would be redistributed to farmers, and representatives to parish councils would be elected, rather than appointed by priests.    The bill has provoked an unprecedented outcry; the church has even threatened to realign itself with the orthodox patriarchate of Constantinople -- or modern-day Istanbul. Few things could be more embarrassing for Mr. Papandreou, whose bellicose stand on Turkey won him such popularity.    The government denies suggestions its decision in February to buy out North Aegean Petroleum Co., a Canadian-led oil consortium that has a drilling concession for disputed waters east of Thassos island, was aimed at provoking a crisis. But &quot;given the government's usual Delphic utterances, it was reasonable for Turkey to assume the opposite,&quot; says a Western diplomat.    A recurring theory for Mr. Papandreou's recent footwork is that he would use any rise in popularity for a bid at the polls, perhaps this autumn or next spring.    One reason: a five-year agreement on four U.S. bases that expires at the end of 1988. Although Mr. Papandreou has long pledged to close the bases, many Greeks doubt he'll do so. A fresh election victory, the theory goes, would leave Mr. Papandreou free to renew the lease without triggering a furious left-wing backlash.    While the Aegean episode may have won Mr. Papandreou points at home, it set back relations with the U.S. By portraying Washington as pro-Turkish and demanding that one U.S. naval base temporarily suspend operations, he tested the limits of U.S. tolerance.    Nobody can say with any certainty whether Mr. Papandreou is making mistakes, is prey to internal party politics or is bluffing his way to a few more years in power. &quot;No one can foresee what Andreas will do,&quot; says the Social Democrats' Mrs. Tsouderos. &quot;Anything goes.&quot;    And have the goings-on damaged Greece's image abroad? &quot;I hope so,&quot; says North Aegean Petroleum's managing director, Lutz Speel. &quot;Who can trust such a government?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
