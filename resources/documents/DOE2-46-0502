High-density coal water mixture (CWM) hasproved to be practircal. Researchers have begun demonstration tests on200 kW fuel cells to improve overall efficiency; High energy-densitysodium-sulfur batteries are promising. Their research also covers fundamentaland applied studies of superconducting materials and variable-speed pumped-storagepower generation. Researchers aim to improve the reliability of powertransmission systems, thus meeting the requirements of urbanized, information-orientedsociety, develop and automate large-capacity underground power transmissionsystems and system stabilizing techniques, and improve customer servicesystems. They also aim to save costs in design, construction, and maintenanceto upgrade safety and environmental preservation techniques. They arealso making attempts to improve housing functions by using electricityand apply electricity to the processing of agricultural and fishery products.</TEXT></DOC>
