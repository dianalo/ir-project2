Certain newly-industrializing economies (NIEs) in theAsia-Pacific region have become increasingly important in worldtrade. Although these economies differ in many important respects,they are all characterized by dynamic, export-led growth which hasallowed them to treble their share of world trade since 1960. Otheroutward-oriented Asian countries are also beginning to emerge asrapidly-growing exporters of manufactures. With increased economicimportance come greater international responsibilities and a strongmutual interest in improved constructive dialogue and cooperativeefforts in the near term between the industrialized countries andthe Asian NIEs, as well as the other outward-oriented countries inthe region. The dialogue and cooperative efforts could center onsuch policy areas as macroeconomic, currency, structural and tradeto achieve the international adjustment necessary for sustained,balanced growth of the world economy. We encourage the developmentof informal processes which would facilitate multilateraldicussions of issues of mutual concern and foster the necessarycooperation.</TEXT><HEAD>Developing Countries and Debt</HEAD><TEXT>   22. The performance of developing countries is increasinglyimportant to the world economy. Central to the prospects of thedeveloping countries are a healthy global economic environment andan open trading system, adequate financial flows and, mostimportant, their commitment to appropriate economic reform. Theproblems of many heavily-indebted developing countries are a causeof economic and political concern and can be a threat to politicalstability in developing countries. Several countries findthemselves in that situation in various regions of the world: LatinAmerica, Africa and the Pacific, particularly the Philippines, andthat merits our special attention.</TEXT><HEAD>Middle-Income Countries</HEAD><TEXT>   23. A number of highly-indebted middle-income countries continueto have difficulties serving their external debt and generating theinvestment necessary for sustainable growth. The market-oriented,growth-led strategy based on the case-by-case approach remains theonly viable approach for overcoming their external debt problems.   24. We are encouraged that many indebted countries have begunthe difficult process of macroeconomic adjustment and structuralreform necessary for sustained progress, encouraging the return offlight capital and new investment flows. The success of theseefforts is essential for improving the economic performance andstrengthening the creditworthiness of these countries.   25. Official financing has played a central role in the debtstrategy through the Paris Club ($73 billion of principal andinterest have been consolidated since 1983) and the flexiblepolicies of export credit agencies. The international financialinstitutions will continue to have a pivotal role. We endorse therecent initiatives taken by the International Monetary Fund tostrengthen its capacity to support medium-term programs ofmacroeconomic adjustment and structural reform and to providegreater protection for adjustment programs from unforeseen externaldevelopments. We strongly support the full implementation of theWorld Bank's $75 billion General Capital Increase to strengthen itscapacity to promote adjustment in middle-income countries. We alsosupport greater awareness by international financial institutionsof the environmental impact of their development programs.   26. Commercial banks have played an important role in supportingdebtor countries' reform efforts through an expanded menu offinancing options which has facilitated the channelling ofcommercial bank lending into productive uses. Their continuedinvolvement is indispensable to the debt strategy. In this regard,the World Bank and IMF can play an important catalytic role inmobilizing additional financing from private (and official) sourcesin support of debtor countries' adjustment programs.   27. We note that in recent years there has been increasingrecourse to innovative financing techniques. The importantcharacteristics of these techniques are that they are voluntary,market-oriented, and applied on a case-by-case basis. The ``menuapproach'' has engendered new financial flows and, in some cases,reduced the existing stock of debt. The flexibility of the presentstrategy would be enhanced by the further broadening of the menuapproach and the encouragement of innovative financing techniquesto improve the quality of new lending, but particular initiativeswould have to be carefully considered.   28. International direct investment plays an important role inspurring economic growth and structural adjustment in developingcountries. Thus it contributes to alleviating debt problems.Developing countries should welcome and encourage such investmentby creating a favorable investment climate.</TEXT><HEAD>Debt of the Poorest</HEAD><TEXT>   29. An increase in concessional resource flows is necessary tohelp the poorest developing countries resume sustained growth,especially in cases where it is extremely difficult for them toservice their debts. Since Venice, progress in dealing with thedebt burden of these countries has been encouraging. Paris Clubcreditors are rescheduling debt at extended grace and repaymentperiods. In addition, the recent enhancement of the IMF'sStructural Adjustment Facility; the World Bank and OfficialDevelopment Assistance (ODA) agencies' enhanced program ofco-financing; and the fifth replenishment of the AfricanDevelopment Fund will mobilize a total of more than 18 billion infavor of the poorest and most indebted countries undertakingadjustment efforts over the period 1988-90. Out of this total, $15billion will be channeled to sub-Saharan African countries.</TEXT></DOC>
