(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It took four months, but 82-year-oldWilfrid Berg finished the mural he started 56 years ago in thechildren's reading room of the city's public library.   The Hackley Public Library dedicated on Thursday the29-foot-long mural that had been curtailed when a New Deal programwas cut in 1934.   ``I'm just overwhelmed,'' Berg said, tears welling in his blueeyes. ``I've always wanted to finish it.''   The mural, featuring characters from classic children'sliterature, stands above bookcases and a doorway directly oppositefrom another mural Berg painted in 1934.   They both had been commissioned by the Works ProgressAdministration.   When funding was canceled, Berg's sketches were stored in theMuskegon Museum of Art. They surfaced a few years ago, and theysupporters of the library decided to sponsor the project.   ``I realized that after all this time, there was the possibilityhe couldn't do it,'' said Robert Youngman, the museum's assistantcurator of graphics. ``But he still has a very sure hand.''   Thursday's ceremony was part of the 100th anniversarycelebration of the library.   Berg kept the mural's original design and theme, ``Idle Hourswith Good Books is Time Well Spent.''   The mural depicts two children sitting on a hill reading _portraits of Berg's siblings as children _ with such characters asCinderella, Huck Finn, Pinocchio and Peter Rabbit around them.Geese, frogs and fairies are scattered throughout.   Berg said he was satisfied with the result but was eager to getout of the public spotlight.   ``I'll be glad when this is all over,'' Berg said of theceremony. ``I've got a lot of projects I want to get started on.''</TEXT></DOC>
