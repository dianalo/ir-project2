In the past five months, no fewer than five bids have been made for Becor, a century-old Rust Belt fixture in South Milwaukee, Wis. Becor's excavation equipment lines are well regarded, and they fit well with most of the suitors' businesses. Another big lure is Becor's cash stockpile of about $184 million.    So bidders are out to make a killing. By offering deals that include debentures, preferred stock and stock in the surviving company, all the would-be acquirers have found ways to buy Becor at seemingly little cost to themselves.    &quot;Becor is attractive to some people,&quot; says John Collopy, an analyst with Cleary, Gull, Reiland, McDevitt andamp; Collopy, a brokerage house in Milwaukee, &quot;but not enough to dig into their own pockets and put their own money on the line.&quot;    Analysts say that a management group's $238.1 million leveraged-buyout bid, which drew the flurry of other offers, was generally perceived to be low. In a depressed mining-equipment market Becor is believed to be a bargain-basement buy, they add. Becor's name is well respected in the mining industry, and its spare parts business -- its most profitable operation -- should virtually sustain itself, even without a market upturn, by supplying gear for aging mine equipment.    But nobody is sure whether the competing offers are any better. Most of the offers consist of cash, stock in the surviving company, and debentures or preferred stock that is difficult to value. Becor has hired First Boston Corp., the investment banker, to study the bids. Few analysts offer an opinion.    &quot;You'd need an army of investment bankers to value these bids,&quot; says Andrew Silver, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. Adds Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., &quot;We're all staying away from this one.&quot;    Part of what has allowed such bids is the cash. As part of the management buyout proposal, Becor recently sold its aerospace division, taking in $109.3 million. Added to the $75 million in cash and temporary investments that the company had as of March 31, and any potential buyer has $184 million that it can use to finance the biggest chunk of its purchase.    When pressed, some analysts estimate the offers fall roughly in between $15 to $16 a share, or a total of about $248 million to $264 million. In recent weeks, Becor common has traded just below that range, with a 52-week high of $16. In Big Board trading yesterday, Becor closed at 15 1/8, up 1/4.    One of the suitors has dropped out, but the three non-management groups that remain -- Davis Mining andamp; Manufacturing Inc., a coal mining and explosives firm in Coeburn, Va.; Lynch Corp., a Fairfield, N.J., packaging and manufacturing concern controlled by New York money manager Mario Gabelli; and ICM Industries Inc., a Chicago manufacturing company run by two former International Harvester executives -- all believe they can run the company better than Becor's management.    ICM Industries, which submitted its bid with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., and Davis Mining both say they have track records in acquiring and turning around underperforming companies. A spokesman for Davis Mining says Becor has substantial operating expenses that need to be cut. One example: Becor's Lear jet.    But Becor's chairman, Norris Ekstrom, says the company has been trying to sell the jet for several months. &quot;We're not a fat cat,&quot; he says. &quot;We're running very lean.&quot;    Last week, Lynch amended its takeover offer because Mr. Gabelli said Becor's managers needed &quot;more guidance in terms of financial structuring.&quot; Investment clients of Gabelli Group Inc. control 12.4% of Becor's 16.5 million common shares outstanding. Earlier this month, the group said it thought the Becor management offer was unfair to shareholders. It launched an offer that Mr. Gabelli said &quot;substantially improves&quot; upon the management bid.    Davis also revised its bid, boosting the cash portion, among other changes.    A Becor spokesman said the company wouldn't reply to the criticisms.    Who will prevail? It's anybody's guess, analysts say. Becor's board met yesterday to discuss First Boston's evaluation of the bids, but its ultimate decision may take some time.    One arbitrager believes the winning bid is going to have to go a good deal higher, perhaps to $18 a share. &quot;When you have four bidders, eventually someone's going to have to break away from the pack,&quot; he says. &quot;Management was trying to steal the company for bottom dollar, and with the amount of exposure these deals have caused, they won't be able to.&quot;    ---   Becor Western Inc.
