Known as a marketer of budget-priced family shoes, the 94-year-old Kinney, a subsidiary of F.W. Woolworth Co., will soon begin sharply increasing its reliance on more expensive, all-leather shoes in its women's line.    To battle growing competition from discount stores and athletic footwear, Kinney is repositioning its women's shoes to appeal to the growing ranks of working women who are willing to spend freely on fashionable dress shoes, said Cameron I. Anderson, Kinney's president and chief executive officer. He didn't disclose Kinney's sales, which analysts estimate were $700 million in 1987.    Starting this fall, Kinney's 1,546 stores, which are mostly in malls, will jazz up the styles of women's shoes that currently comprise about 40% of its sales. In an effort to appeal to women's demands for higher-quality shoes, by fall about 95% of Kinney's women's dress shoes will be all leather, up from 60%, said Mr. Anderson. The shoes will sell for $25 to $70 a pair, or 10% to 15% higher than current prices, because of their increased leather content.    &quot;We see some potential in the women's side of the industry and we see weakness in our competitors,&quot; Mr. Anderson said. &quot;Now is the time for us to make some inroads with stronger display presentation and modernizing our stores,&quot; he added.    In recent years, retail analysts say, sales have lagged at family shoe stores such as Kinney and Thom McCan Shoe Co., a division of Melville Corp., because of competition from discount shoe chains and from athletic shoes, which now have a 40% share of the shoe market.    &quot;Kinney, which has had great success with its Foot Locker and other successful athletic shoe stores, knows that they've got a problem with the family shoe stores,&quot; says Barry Bryant, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. &quot;What happens to retail formats that don't change is that they deteriorate.&quot;    He added that manufacturers of name-brand athletic shoes such as Adidas and Reebok don't sell to family shoe stores. And these stores' profits have been eroded by the higher cost of importing shoes, the analyst said. &quot;For a while, the low-priced foreign goods drove the low-priced shoe business, but the weak dollar has hurt that advantage.&quot; Kinney said about 60% of its leather shoes are imported from Taiwan, Italy, Spain and Brazil.    St. Louis-based Edison Brothers Stores Inc., which sells modest-priced women's shoes through its Bakers, Leeds Chandlers, and The Wild Pair stores, has also been emphasizing more all-leather styles. But Edison Brothers believes that the women's shoe business has been hurt by a lack of new styles. Andrew Newman, Edison Brothers chairman, said,&quot;The dress shoe business has been tough this spring,&quot; mainly because most women already have several pairs of the simple pumps that remain fashionable. </TEXT></DOC>
