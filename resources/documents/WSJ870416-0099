Shultz is due in Brussels today to explain to NATO ministers what kinds of arms-control understandings he reached in Moscow this week with Eduard Shevardnadze and Mikhail Gorbachev. The ministers as they listen might want to ponder those words of enticement, attributed to Mr. Gorbachev by Tass, quoted in the headline above.    What is there indeed to be afraid of? Well, start with an agreement incorporating the following bargain: In return for President Reagan's giving up his Strategic Defense Initiative, the Soviets will agree to accept massive conventional-arms superiority in the European theater. To judge by the reports out of Moscow, this is what has been in the air in Moscow after Secretary Shultz agreed to visit despite the affronts of Soviet successes in compromising our embassy there.    We assume that Secretary Shultz will assure the NATO ministers that there is nothing to be afraid of at all. That what is close is an agreement on medium-range missiles, though Mr. Gorbachev had proposed to remove Soviet &quot;short-range&quot; missiles as well from their bases in East Germany and Czechoslovakia. There were even hints of proposed reductions in tactical nuclear weapons, which are numerous on both sides.    Further, that the American proposals on the Strategic Defense Initiative won't delay anything because they last only seven years. If the Soviets say they want to dismantle the nuclear arsenal that threatens Western Europe, surely they must be taken at their word. Mr. Gorbachev had even added: &quot;We are for a reliable agreement with the most stringent and all-embracing control.&quot;    The more skeptical of NATO ministers, however, might wonder whether it isn't too good to be true. Even assuming the Soviets don't cheat, a nonnuclear Europe would leave Moscow militarily predominant, with a general nuclear exchange left as the only Western answer to Soviet arms. A seven-year restriction on strategic defense would, on the precedent of all other arms treaties, become a death sentence for President Reagan's SDI. The West would be fatally inhibited in using its trump card of technology, while the Soviets would have free use of their advantage of mobilizing huge military manpower through something close to slave labor.    As readers of these columns know, we have the most profound skepticism toward any attempt to tame the Russian bear by writing arms-control agreements along the lines of Western contract law. We do not believe the Soviet Union, which has spent 40 years steadily expanding its capacity to project military power throughout the world, has suddenly had a change of heart under Mr. Gorbachev.    Mr. Gorbachev's p.r. campaign notwithstanding, in substance he looks very much like Soviet leaders of the past. Indeed, even his p.r. wore a little thin during the Shultz visit as he attempted to play hard-to-get in response to President Reagan's invitation to visit the U.S. In a clumsy effort to suggest that the president is a lame duck, he remarked: &quot;When I will be nearing retirement, then I may travel just for pleasure, but now I need business.&quot; In our view, a smart-aleck remark like that would be sufficient cause for withdrawing the invitation.    In case anyone believes the Soviets have changed, here are some items from the Associated Press of the past two days:    Islamabad, Pakistan -- Soviet jets bombed and machine-gunned villages in northern Afghanistan in revenge for a guerrilla attack on Soviet territory, and troops blocked roads to prevent civilians from escaping, sources said today.    Moscow-Kuwait will rent three Soviet tankers to carry oil in the Persian Gulf combat zone and also may be given Soviet military escorts, a foreign-ministry spokesman said.    While Secretary Shultz was trading toasts in Moscow, in short, the Soviets were opening yet another merciless attack on Afghan civilians and a wholly new attempt to insert their tankers and navy into the oil-supply lines of Europe.    Implicitly the Reykjavik summit and the &quot;zero option&quot; ask the European allies to take some responsibility for arms control. Instead of appeasing their domestic left demanding that President Reagan prove his &quot;sincerity,&quot; the NATO leaders now must either accept or oppose an agreement they privately find distasteful. But the agreement would go away overnight if Helmut Kohl or Margaret Thatcher stood up in public and said it threatened national security. Why don't NATO leaders say in public what they say in private? As the Soviets asked, &quot;What are you afraid of?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
