Also Saturday, real earthquakes rattled Chile and Guatemala, butthere were no reports of injuries.   Cuba's Civil Defense Department made the bogus reports on anamateur radio frequency, asking for international help for adamaging earthquake in eastern Cuba, said emergency officials andamateur radio operators in the neighboring Dominican Republic.   ``Later, they (the Cubans) gave their excuses,'' said NadimCury, director of the Dominican Red Cross and two amateur radiooperators.   ``We have tapes of the broadcasts,'' said Baldomero Quezada, aformer president of the national Radio Amateur Association.   According to the broadcasts monitored in the Dominican Republic,the earthquake hit three eastern provinces in Cuba: Santiago,Cienfuegos and Palma Soriano. The reports said it killed hundreds,buckled roads and virtually destroyed the coastal town of Santiago.   ``At no time in those first broadcasts did they (Cubans) saythey were carrying out a simulated disaster drill,'' Cury said.   The Dominican Radio Amateur Association will consider protestingthe broadcasts to the international organization, Quezada said.   As a result of the reports, broadcast from Havana over the RadioClub amateur frequency in Santiago, Red Cross and Civil Defenseauthorities in the Dominican Republic were placed on a``first-alert basis until we could determine what we could do tohelp,'' said Cury.   The earthquake reports also prompted international telephonecalls from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Colombia to theCuban Interest section in Washington, Cuba's Foreign Relationsoffice in Havana, and the Sierra Maestra newspaper in Santiago.   Reporters and photographers prepared to make the trip to reporton the earthquake.   Cuban officials and citizens ended the uproar by explaining tocallers that there was no earthquake.   ``There has been no earthquake in Santiago,'' said Ms. Magali deDaigne, a telephone operator at the Santiago newspaper.   Cuban officials in Washington and Havana, who did not identifythemselves, said they knew nothing of an earthquake.   A report by Prensa Latina, the Cuban government news agencymonitored in Mexico City, denied a major earthquake hit the easternprovinces.   ``The only thing that is taking place in Santiago de Cuba arethe Meteoro 88 exercises, which include evacuation drills in theevent of natural disasters,'' Prensa Latina said.   Geophysicist John Minsch at National Earthquake InformationCenter in Golden, Colo., said there was ``no record of a quake inCuba in this morning's records.''   Nelson Montalvo, a second amateur radio operator in SantoDomingo, said, ``I took the report seriously when I attempted tocontact them (in Santiago), and they told me I could not use thefrequency because of the emergency.''   Later Saturday, Santiago radio amateur operators admitted it was``a simulated drill,'' according to Cury.   After giving excuses, the Cubans said, ``We now know what kindof reaction to expect from our radio colleagues and Dominicanauthorities'' in the event of a disaster, according to Montalvo.   Meanwhile, in Santiago, Chile, a strong earthquake caused alarmbut no injuries or damage, authorities said. It measured 5.3 on theRichter scale.   The Seismological Institute of the University of Chile said thequake hit at 10:28 EDT. The epicenter was off the country's centralcoast, 125 miles northwest of Santiago.   In addition, four small earthquakes rocked central Guatemalaover a period of seven hours Saturday, causing no damage orcasualties, authorities reported. Minsch had no record of thosequakes.   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by anearthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on aseismograph. Every increase of one number marks a 10-fold increasein ground motion. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerabledamage in populated areas.</TEXT></DOC>
