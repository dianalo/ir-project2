 Making newslately are Beyond with its BeyondMail and @Mail, Reach Software Corp. withits MailMAN, and Software Publishing Corp., which has bundled e-mail handlinginto its new Windows word processor, Professional Write Plus.andP;  All of theseproducts are part of the evolution of e-mail towards a client/serverarchitecture.andM;In general, the client/server model splits the functionality of softwarebetween a back-end server and a front-end client.andP;  Usually, the term isreserved for those applications intelligent enough to store something on theserver and provide the client only with what it needs.andM;On a simple level, client/server e-mail unbundles the traditional e-mailpackage.andP;  The back-end e-mail engine separates from the front-end userinterface.andP;  Gateways such as those in this review play a prominent role inthe client/server model.andP;  They usually come unbundled, hang off the e-mailengine, and serve as a local e-mail system's interface to the world.andP;  Thismay seem a simple concept, but it has dramatic implications for developers offront-end, back-end, and gateway products.andM;Front-end companies will be able to focus on developing the user interface.andO;They can turn their attention to developing front-end tools that expand therole of e-mail.andP;  Hot topics in this area include user agents, as embodied inBeyondMail, and mail-enabled applications, typified by MailMAN.andM;Meanwhile, back-end companies can concentrate on efficient andeasy-to-administer engines.andP;  The engine must be able to assume responsibilityfor directory services, message storage, and transport services.andP;  Developersof these engines will provide administrators with the tools they need tomanage their mail systems effectively.andM;Since gateways under this scenario typically come unbundled, gatewaydevelopers can focus on connectivity to MHS, X.400, PROFS, and SMTP in thesame gateway.andP;  Standards like MHS and X.400 become even more crucial in theera of client/server e-mail: There can be no surprises between the sender'sfront end and the receiver's.andM;BEYOND MAIL AND @MAIL:andM;TWO STEPS BEYONDandM;Beyond sells two products that push e-mail into the next generation.andP;  @Mail,a $129.95 e-mail front end, works from within Lotus 1-2-3 and Symphony.andO;Another e-mail front end, the $695.00 BeyondMail, offers advanced routingcapabilities and is scheduled for release this summer.andM;@Mail is a niche product that may herald a new category of software add-ons.andO;Because of the way @Mail is integrated into 1-2-3, you can use the menus youknow and love when working with your e-mail messages.andP;  The program also makesit easy to share and collaborate on Lotus files via e-mail while developing1-2-3 models.andM;The best feature of @Mail is its use of the Lotus macro language.andP;  Usingprogrammed macros, you can create a data-driven application.andP;  You could, forexample, automatically congratulate all sales personnel through e-mail oncethe value in a spreadsheet cell goes beyond a certain number.andM;The upcoming flagship of the Beyond line, BeyondMail, will introducetechnology new to the commercial e-mail market.andP;  It draws on researchlicensed from MIT Information Lens and originally used in an MIT projectcalled Object Lens.andM;Beyond heralds its product as the answer to chronic information over-load.andO;BeyondMail uses information in the e-mail header and text as filters to routemail in an intelligent way.andP;  It can place the mail you most want to read inyour Urgent folder, and forward mail for you automatically.andP;  The product letsyou make your e-mail world behave the way you want it.andP;  @Mail uses No-vellMHS as the back-end server; BeyondMail will too, when it ships.andM;MAILMAN: E-MAIL MANAGEMENT UNDER WINDOWSandM;The MAN in MailMAN is capitalized because MANagement is what Reach Softwarestresses.andP;  MailMAN is a $995 Windows-based application designed as a clientfront end to manage work flow.andP;  It provides for such basic e-mail messageservices as the creation and editing of text, the addressing and routing ofenvelopes, and the use of attachments.andP;  When integrated into work-flowmanagement applications, MailMAN serves as an agent for the routing ofelectronic objects such as text or images among various users andapplications.andM;MailMAN relies heavily on the Windows environment to deliver itsfunctionality.andP;  Support for Windows DDE (dynamic data exchange) and OLE(object linking and embedding) form the backbone of MailMAN's object-flowmanagement.andP;  Even its ability to launch applications relies on a Windowsfeature.andP;  Although MailMAN is currently available for VINES networks only byusing Banyan's proprietary back-end engine, Reach promises that upcomingversions will use MHS on NetWare, and popular e-mail back-end engines such asLotus's cc:Mail on LAN Manager networks.andM;CONTINUESandM;PROFESSIONAL WRITE PLUS:andM;E-MAIL FOR WORD PROCESSINGandM;Software Publishing Corp.'s $249 Professional Write Plus demonstrates thatthe company also understands the potential for building e-mail front endsinto applications.andP;  Although SPC's program is a Windows-based word processor,not an e-mail package, the full-featured e-mail front end inside ProfessionalWrite Plus facilitates sending and receiving messages, including ProfessionalWrite Plus documents.andP;  You can also insert graphics or selected text fromyour documents in the message.andM;The e-mail capability works from inside the word processor, using Windowsdialog boxes.andP;  By selecting a menu choice, you can invoke the e-mail frontend.andP;  Professional Write Plus's e-mail functions include all of the featuresthat you would expect in a standalone e-mail package, including mailnotification and an address book.andP;  The e-mail capability works by attachingto Novell MHS.andM;Documents can be group efforts, and users can easily pass them to each otherwhile working within the word processor they use to create and edit them.andO;Missing from Professional Write Plus, however, are any special e-mail editingfeatures, like redlining to keep track of which user made edits in adocument, or any form of version control.andP;  On the other hand, the completee-mail package is yours for the price of the word processor, which isinexpensive to begin with, Client/serv er architecture has been the buzzwordin network databases long enough for people to wonder if the year ofclient/server will prove as elusive as the year of the LAN.andP;  But in thee-mail world, these four packages show that the long-awaited year may be verynear.andM;BeyondMail, Version 1.0andM;@Mail, Version 1.0andM;Beyond Inc., 38 Sidney St., Cambridge, MA 02139; 617-621-0095.andM;List Price: BeyondMail: Server Edition (includes one-user license), $695;5-node expansion pack, $395;
