The candidate promised them he would deliver a major speech outlining his vision for the cities, listeners recall. But the election came and went -- without the speech.    &quot;There was substantial disappointment,&quot; says Richard Hatcher, then mayor of Gary, Ind., who attended the meeting with Mr. Mondale. &quot;This time, we need to get candidates to buy into the urban agenda before the nomination.&quot;    As primaries in New York and other big urban states approach, issues of the cities are beginning to float to the surface like air bubbles. But drawing attention to urban problems has demanded considerable effort on the part of the nation's mayors and other local elected officials. Even then, political observers say, the discussions among the candidates, like the bubbles, lack substance.    The candidates &quot;aren't cooking on the subject,&quot; says Donna E. Shalala, who was assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Carter. Although the problems of the cities are worsening fast, the issues involved are complex and divisive. The debate also suffers from a feeling that the Democrats, particularly Jesse Jackson, have a hammerlock on the inner-city vote. The cities' slow growth over the years, moreover, has diminished their political power.    Many mayors and local officials are annoyed that only Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis showed up at the National League of Cities annual convention last December. While most of the candidates have issued position papers on such city-related problems as drugs, housing and education, none has yet produced a major position paper dealing solely with the cities.    This is a critical election year for the nation's cities as they try to regain standing with the federal government. Under the Reagan administration, federal funding dropped sharply. Community Development Block Grant expenditures have been cut 28% since 1980, Urban Development Action Grants 68% and federally subsidized housing 70%.    The nation's central cities have become more violent, more impoverished and more isolated than ever before. Drug wars have turned neighborhoods into battlegrounds. Housing shortages have helped feed the still-growing homeless population. And 18% of those residing in the cities live below the poverty threshold, up from 15.8% 10 years ago.    These problems &quot;will choke the nation to death,&quot; says Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode. &quot;This is the last chance for the Democratic Party to show what it stands for.&quot;    While the campaign rhetoric flows as freely as the inner-city drug trade, there is a sense of urgency among the cities' leaders. For the first time, the Conference of Mayors drafted an extensive urban revitalization program with the hopes of influencing the candidates. The National League of Cities for the first time is attempting to become a big player in a presidential election. It has put together a bipartisan effort called &quot;Election '88&quot; in the hope of getting local officials to become more politically active. And last fall, New York's Mayor Edward Koch urged other mayors to refrain from endorsing any candidates until the candidates adopt an urban platform.    Most mayors are calling for more federal dollars for their cities. A potential price tag is hard to come by. But the Conference of Mayors estimates that in 1980, when cities felt a more vital part of the national agenda, key urban programs totaled $21.8 billion. That support has since been cut nearly in half.    The mayors want to avoid a rerun of the 1984 campaign. While the Democratic mayors felt snubbed by Mr. Mondale, the Republicans complained bitterly about being neglected by their party's platform committee. Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut remembers sitting in the Dallas convention hall counting the number of times the word &quot;city&quot; was mentioned in his party's platform. &quot;I got to three, if that,&quot; he recalls.    But advocates for the cities face many barriers. Early primaries in the rural states precluded initial discussion of urban issues. And a general feeling that the Democrats -- Jesse Jackson in particular -- have a lock on the big-city vote has kept other candidates away. During the Illinois primary, only Mr. Jackson visited Chicago's poorest neighborhood. In fact, says the area's alderman, Bobby Rush, no candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976 has made a campaign stop in his district.    For the Republicans, the cities can be unwelcome territory. Of the 50 largest cities, only nine have Republican mayors, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. And since 1952, the percentage of votes cast for Democrats in presidential elections has risen in Detroit to 81% from 60%,in Baltimore to 71% from 51%, and in New York to 61% from 54%, according to the Elections Research Center, a nonpartisan research group. &quot;The Democrats pay more attention to the cities simply because they have more control,&quot; says the center's Richard Scammon.    The issues involved, such as the role of the federal government and welfare reform, are complex and divisive. Proposed solutions raise the specter of increased spending, an unpopular prospect, given the huge budget deficit. Some also suggest that a dearth of urban research by policy groups and scholars has left the candidates few policy initiatives to consider.    &quot;There has been a kind of attitude that anything government does makes things worse, so why try,&quot; says Gary Orfield, a professor of public policy at the University of Chicago. And many cities' share of their states' electorate has dropped substantially, particularly with the migration to the suburbs.    Nonetheless, in such big urban states as New York, no Democratic candidate can ignore the problems of the cities and expect to make a respectable showing. After all, New York's seven biggest urban counties, which comprise New York City, Rochester and Buffalo, account for 61.7% of the state's total registered Democrats. &quot;If you don't have an urban program you can defend here, you might as well go home,&quot; says New York's Mayor Koch. &quot;You're not going to be able to dance and diddle here.&quot;    A debate on urban issues among the Democratic candidates at Fordham University in the Bronx kicked off the state's primary season. There, candidates urged a greater federal role in the cities. The forum was viewed so seriously by some that a Dukakis no-show may have cost him at least one possible endorsement: &quot;For a governor who rightly perceives himself to be an urban governor, this debate in my view was indispensable,&quot; says the Bronx's borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who has endorsed Mr. Jackson. A Dukakis aide says he had a schedule conflict.    The mayors and others expect further discussion of the cities with the approach of the primaries in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and California.    But at least one observer advises against offering prescriptions for the inner city. &quot;I despair when {candidates} try to do the 30-second sound bite,&quot; says David Ellwood, a Harvard University assistant professor of public policy. &quot;They either end up sounding like a silly liberal or conversely sounding very insensitive,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm just not sure there are any easy answers or a nice easy slogan.&quot;    ---                  Federal Aid to Cities                 (In billions of dollars) Community Development Block Grants 1988 .................................... $2.9 1980 .................................... $4.0 Urban Development Action Grants 1988 ..................................... $.216 1980 ..................................... $.675 Federally subsidized housing 1988 .................................... $7.9 1980 ................................... $26.7 - General revenue sharing 1988 ..................................
