A new Enserch subsidiary will act as general partner of the limited partnership that will own the plant, but the subsidiary will have only a 1% equity interest.    The two limited partners involved in the project are affiliates of Prudential Capital Corp., a unit of Prudential Insurance Cos. of America, and the Montana Power Co. Financing will be provided by 23 institutions and led by an affiliate of Prudential Capital, Enserch said.    In addition, Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd., the limited partnership which conducts most of Enserch Corp.'s oil and gas operations, will provide 65% of the natural gas to be used by the 255-megawatt cogeneration plant, including an initial sale of 133 billion cubic feet of gas reserves for $158 million.    Enserch said its units involved include: Ebasco Constructors Inc., which will design and construct the plant; Enserch Gas Co., which will provide the gas not provided by Enserch Exploration; Lone Star Gas Co., which will transport the gas; and Lone Star Energy Co., which will operate the plant.    Texas Utilities Co., Dallas, will buy the electricity produced by the plant. Construction is expected to begin by mid-1988 and be completed by the summer of 1989.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enserch was unchanged at $18 a share; Enserch Exploration closed at $12 a share, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
