A proposed revision and restructuring ofPart 790 into Parts 790 and 792 was issued by the NCUA Board on October13, 1988 (<T3>see </T3>53 FR 42955, 10/25/88). The NCUA Board has now adopted theproposed revision in final form with minor modifications described below.Part 790 describes NCUA's organization and addresses public requests foraction by NCUA. Part 792 addresses requests for information under the Freedomof Information Act, the Privacy Act, and by subpoena and contains informationconcerning securities procedures to protect classified national securityinformation.

It had been several yearssince Part 790 was last revised. The revision presents the informationin a more logical order and updates the information found in the rule.The Board issued a proposed rule on October 13, 1988, with a ninety-daypublic comment period. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 42955, 10/25/88.) Only two public comment letters werereceived, one from a Federal credit union and one from a national creditunion trade association. Both commenters fully supported the proposed revisions.The Board has adopted the proposed revision in final form with only minormodifications.The information found in old Part 790 has been divided into Parts 790 and792. Part 790 is now entitled ``Description of NCUA; Requests for AgencyAction'' and contains information concerning NCUA organization and publicrequests for action by NCUA. Section 701.5 (``Other Applications'') waspreviously proposed to be removed from the NCUA Regulations. (<T3>See </T3>52 FR 47014, 12/11/87.) In the proposed revision to Part 790,it was suggested that some of the information found in Section 701.5 beretained in the regulations, but that it fit more appropriately in Part790. The Board proposed that the information in andSection; 701.5 be removedand that the necessary information be placed in andSection; 790.3_Requestsfor Agency Action. The Board has retained this change in the final rule.Part 792 is now entitled ``Requests for Information Under the Freedom ofInformation Act and Privacy Act, and by Subpoena; Security Procedures forClassified Information.'' The title is self-explanatory. The regulationentitled ``Employee Responsibility and Conduct'' was previously found atPart 792. It has been redesignated as Part 796, as proposed.This final revision contains only minor modifications from the proposal.A detailed section-by-section analysis was set forth in the SupplementaryInformation section of the proposal. Only the modifications made to theproposal are explained below.Section 790.2 is entitled ``Central and Regional Office Organization.''It sets forth the organization of NCUA and describes all of the officeswithin the Agency. Section 790.2(b)(4) of the proposal described the Officeof the Internal Auditor. In October of 1988, the Congress passed the 1988Amendments to the 1978 Inspector General Act. These amendments requiredthe NCUA to establish an Office of Inspector General by mid-April, 1989.The NCUA Board established an Office of Inspector General and has abolishedthe Office of Internal Auditor. A description of the Office of InspectorGeneral has been substituted for the description of the Office of InternalAuditor in andSection; 790.2(b)(4). In addition, the reference to the InternalAuditor in the description of the Office of the Executive Director foundin andSection; 790.2(b)(2) has been deleted since, according to the 1988Amendments to the Inspector General Act, the Inspector General must reportdirectly to the NCUA Board.Technical corrections to two proposed sections have been made. First, andSection;790.2(c)(1) sets forth a chart containing the addresses of each of thesix NCUA Regional Offices and the states and territories within the jurisdictionof each of the Regional Offices. Corrections have been made to the addressesfor Regions IV and V. Second, a reference in proposed andSection; 792.41to andSection; 792.42 has been changed to andSection; 792.3. This was a typographicalerror in the proposal. Other typographical errors found in the proposedrules have been corrected.The remainder of the final revision is identical to the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Since this final rule imposes requirements on the NCUA rather than on creditunions, submitters or requesters of information, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the Paperwork Reduction Act and Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism'')are inapplicable.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG> 12 CFR Part 790Credit unions, Description, Organization.12 CFR Part 792Credit unions, Applications, Freedom of information, Fees, Waivers, Subpoenas,Privacy, National security procedures.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on April 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA is amending its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 701.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> [Removed]</ITAG>1.

In paragraph (b) of this section,those systems of records are identified by System Name and System Number,as stated in the NCUA's ``Notice of Systems of Records,'' published inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The provisions from which each system is exemptedand the reasons therefor are also set forth. (b)(1) System NCUA-1, entitled ``Employee Security Investigations ContainingAdverse Information,'' consists of adverse information about NCUA employeeswhich has been obtained as a result of routine Office of Personnel ManagementSecurity Investigations. To the extent that NCUA maintains records in thissystem pursuant to Office of Personnel Management guidelines which requireor may require retrieval of information by use of individual identifiers,those records are encompassed by and included in the Office of PersonnelManagement Government-Wide System of Records Number 4, entitled ``PersonnelInvestigations Records,'' and thus are subject to the applicable specificexemptions promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management. Additionally,in order to ensure the protection of properly confidential sources, particularlyas to those records which are not maintained pursuant to such Office ofPersonnel Management requirements, the records in these systems of recordsare exempted, pursuant to section k(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5)),from section (d) of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)). To the extent that disclosureof a record would reveal the identity of a confidential source, NCUA neednot grant access to that record by its subject. Information which wouldreveal a confidential source shall, however, whenever possible, be extractedor summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary orextract shall be provided to the requesting individual. (2) System NCUA-4, entitled ``Investigative Reports Involving PossibleFelonies and/or Violations of the Federal Credit Union Act,'' consistsof a limited number of records about individuals suspected or involvementin felonies or infractions under the Federal Credit Union Act or criminalstatutes. These records are maintained in an overall context of generalinvestigative information concerning crimes against credit unions. To theextent that individually identifiable information is maintained, however,for purposes of protecting the security of any investigations by appropriatelaw enforcement authorities and promoting the successful prosecution ofall actual criminal activity, the records in this system are exempted,pursuant to section k(2) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)), fromsections (c)(3), and (d)). NCUA need not make an accounting of previousdisclosures of a record in this system of records available to its subject,the NCUA need not grant access to any records in this system of recordsby their subject. Further, whenever individuals request records about themselvesand maintained in this system of records, the NCUA shall, to the extentnecessary to realize the above-stated purposes, neither confirm nor denythe existence of the records but shall advise the individuals only thatno records available to them pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974 have beenidentified. However, should review of the record reveal that the informationcontained therein has been used or is being used to deny the individualsany right, privilege or benefit for which they are eligible or to whichthey would otherwise be entitled under Federal law, the individuals shallbe advised of the existence of the information and shall be provided theinformation, except to the extent disclosure would identify a confidentialsource. Information which would identify a confidential source shall, ifpossible, be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the sourceand the summary or extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.(c) For purposes of this Section, a ``confidential source'' means a sourcewho furnished information to the Government under an express promise thatthe identity of the source would remain confidential, or, prior to September27, 1976, under an implied promise that the identity of the source wouldbe held in confidence.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 792.35</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Security of systems of records.</ITAG>(a) Each system manager, with the approval of the head of that Office,shall establish administrative and physical controls to insure the protectionof a system of records from unauthorized access or disclosure and fromphysical damage or destruction.
