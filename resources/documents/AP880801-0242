During the previous week, the rig count had increased by four tototal 903. A year ago this week, the count totaled 973, the companysaid.   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plungedto less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and therig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughesbegan compiling figures.   Among major oil producing states, Colorado, New Mexico andWyoming saw the biggest increase with five new rigs each whileNorth Dakota increased by one.   Texas saw the biggest decline with nine, followed by Kansas,eight; Oklahoma, five; California and Michigan, three each; Ohio,two, and Pennsylvania, one. Louisiana saw no change from last week.</TEXT></DOC>
