<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0197 </DOCNO><TEXT>Superconducting compositions of the general formula AnQmCu3Oy are preparedby wet mixing a combination organic acid salts, inorganic acid saltsand oxides of A, Q and Cu, wherein at least one salt is an organic acidsalt, drying the mixed salts, and then heating the resultant mixed saltsto a temperature between 500 and 950 C. The temperature is maintainedfor a time sufficient to form a substantially orthorhombic superconductingcomposition. The method achieves good results with only one heating step.The presence of at least one organic salt causes carbonate and nitratesalts of A, Q and Cu to convert to oxides at temperatures between 300and 400 C. With lower processing temperatures, semiconductor materialsand superconducting materials can be processed together.</TEXT></DOC>
