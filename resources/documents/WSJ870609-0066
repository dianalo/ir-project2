Brookehill offered to buy the shares of Holly it and its two affiliates don't already own for $110 a share. Brookehill and its affiliates hold about 12.6% of the sugar producer's 1.1 million common shares outstanding, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing submitted yesterday.    The proposal offers $70 a share in cash and $40 a share in securities, consisting of junior subordinated debt or cumulative exchangeable preferred stock or a combination of both, Holly said.    Brookehill's offer has an indicated value of $107.8 million, but because of the complexities of the offer, analysts differ on its actual value.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Holly Sugar closed at $104.50 a share, up $1.25.    A Holly spokesman said the company's independent committee of its board was reviewing the latest proposal, which Brookehill presented in a letter to the committee.    Holly has received buyout bids from Arcanum I Partners and Shamrock Holdings of California Inc. in the last two months.    Arcanum, an investor group including Holly's chairman, Michael Buchsbaum, and other senior officials last month sweetened its bid to take the company private in a leveraged buyout to $40 in cash and a $90 11.5% subordinated debenture for each of the about 900,000 shares of Holly stock that it doesn't already own. Last December, the group offered $35 in cash and one share of a new issue of preferred stock for the shares.    Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based investment firm controlled by members of the Roy E. Disney family, has offered $45 in cash, a certificate called a &quot;stub&quot; that would pay as much as $70 over 20 years, and either a share of preferred stock valued at $70 or an increasing-rate debenture valued at $35. In April, Shamrock dislosed in an SEC filing that it held a 9% stake in Holly.    Officials representing Shamrock and Arcanum partners weren't available for comment.    Analysts also differ on the actual value of the two proposals.    Last month, Brookehill said it asked Holly to call a special shareholders meeting so that &quot;important matters relating to the sale of the corporation can be addressed by the shareholders.&quot; Brookehill said at the time that it intends at the meeting to &quot;seek the election of directors who will actively seek to maximize shareholder value.&quot; Holly hasn't responded to the request.    Holly said Brookehill's proposal is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of its due diligence review of the company, the receipt of the necessary financing and a definitive merger agreement.    Brookehill said it has a financing proposal from Irving Trust Co. for a $100 million credit facility and said PaineWebber Inc. is &quot;highly confident&quot; that it can obtain commitments for $40 million in senior subordinated debt. </TEXT></DOC>
