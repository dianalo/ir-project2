PeacekeepingForce in Cyprus for six more months, as it has done twice a yearsince dispatching the force in 1964.   Peace talks between the Greek and Turkish sectors of theMediterranean island are stalemated. U.N. peacekeepers separate thefeuding communities.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's latest report onCyprus said no progress on reuniting the island was made in thelast year.   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus and Rauf Denktash, leaderof the breakaway Turkish sector in northern Cyprus, met separatelywith Perez de Cuellar for talks this month but gave no sign ofbudging.   Denktash insists Cyprus must renounce any claim to governing theTurkish Cypriots and recognize his government as legitimate.Vassiliou reiterates his government's claim to authority over thewhole island.   Turkey is the only country that recognizes Denktash's TurkishRepublic of Northern Cyprus.   Vassiliou says Greek Cypriots must have the right to travel,live and own property anywhere on the island. Denktash says theminority Turkish community would lose its identity if it does nothave a protected enclave.   ``For the Turkish Cypriots, the border stands for liberation andsecurity,'' the Turkish Cypriot envoy, Ozer Koray, told the council.   Koray complained that the Vassiliou administration spent``enormous sums'' to buy weapons and no mention was made of this inPerez de Cuellar's report.   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in 1974following a short-lived, Greek-backed coup by supporters of unionwith Greece.   The Turks seized the northern one-third of the island. TheTurkish Cypriot minority proclaimed a breakaway republic there in1983.</TEXT></DOC>
