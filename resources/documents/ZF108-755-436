Steve: Most tutorials on digital technology describe a 64 Kbpscircuit, sometimes referred to as a DSO circuit, as the basic building blockof digital transmission.andP;  The 64 Kbps figure is arrived at by the processknown as Pulse Code Modulation (PCM).andM;PCM converts a voice signal to a digital signal by first sampling the voice8,000 times per second to detect changes in its waveform and then assigningthe sample a value ranging from 0 to 255.andP;  This value is then converted intoan 8-bit binary number represented by a combination of eight 1s and 0s.andM;Since there are 8,000 samples per second and 8-bits per sample, it takes8,000 x 8-bits or 64,000 bits per second (bps) to turn a human voice into adigital signal using PCM.andP;  Where the confusion starts is how this theory isput into practice in the real world.andM;Digital networks use special amplifiers, known as regenerators, to amplifyand re-transmit the digital signal every few miles.andP;  In order to keepsynchronized with the signal being amplified, regenerators use a techniqueknown as &quot;maintaining ones density,&quot; whereby the last bit in every 8-bitdigital word is forced to be a 1.andM;This effectively means that 8 Kbps is dedicated to helping the regeneratorsdo their work and 56 Kbps is left over to carry the voice conversation.andP;  Thelong distance carriers have latched onto the term 56 Kbps to describe theirservices that work in this manner, like ATandamp;Ts Accunet 56, MCI's Vnet 56 andSprint's VPN 56.andM;A recently developed standard, known as Binary Eight Zero Substitution(B8ZS), allows regenerators to keep synchronization without maintaining onesdensity.andP;  By removing the need to dedicate 8 Kbps for synchronization, thefull 64 Kbps channel is &quot;clear&quot; to carry voice or data.andP;  That's why they callit a clear channel.andM;The benefit of clear channel is that it gives you a higher transmissionspeed.andP;  In applications where several slow-speed data circuits aremultiplexed into a DS-0 circuit, clear channel provides an additional 8 Kbpscircuit for free.andM;Clear channel also has tremendous applications for companies that use voicecompression equipment.andP;  The extra speed helps them get a compressed voicechannel on circuits previously used just for data or get an additionalcompressed voice channel on existing DS-0 circuits.andP;  TELECONNECT: We hearabout &quot;switched' 56 Kbps.andP;  But don't you need a  dedicated&quot; line to thelong-distance company's downtown location to get the service? If you do, whydo they call it switched?' Steve: Traditional 56 Kbps lines use a dedicatedconnection from end to end.andP;  Typically, this meant a company had to have adedicated circuit from its location to the long distance carrier'spoint-of-presence POP).andM;The long distance carrier would provide a dedicated circuit from its POP inthe originating city to its POP in the distant city.andP;  And the telco in thedistant city would provide another dedicated circuit to the customer'slocation.andP;  The entire circuit was dedicated to the customer and was availableat a flat price for unlimited usage.andM;But today's &quot;switched&quot; Services don't have to have this completely dedicatedconnection from POP to POP.andP;  They use sophisticated digital cross-connectequipment to establish a connection upon demand.andM;The long distance carriers find this to be a much more economical method ofproviding the 56 Kbps capacity, since most companies can share the samedigital network between cities.andP;  The long distance carriers refer to servicesthat operate in this manner as &quot;switched&quot; even though you still needdedicated lines from the telco to get at the service.andP;  TELECONNECT: Alrightalready.andP;  How about a few applications? Steve: Say, a large distributioncompany has switched 56 Kbps circuits connecting its headquarters to each ofits branch offices in 28 different states.andP;  During the day, the circuit isused to send order information via Group IV fax.andP;  During the evening, thecircuit is used to send data from each branch's AS/400 computer to thecorporate mainframe.andM;And each of the seven regional offices have video conferencing equipment thatoperates off of two 56 Kbps circuits.andP;  Scheduled morning video  conferencesand impromptu afternoon conferences help managers from the different sitesconfer with each other and learn from each other.andM;Then there's the engineering and construction company with a number of highlycomplex construction projects scattered across the country.andP;  Switched 56 Kbpscircuits are installed to each remote job site.andP;  This connects them to thecorporate mainframe and they can send updated blueprints from the field andfreeze-frame video so the staff at the main location can get involved inproblem diagnosis, review diagrams, whatever.andM;How about a chain of department stores? It could install dedicated 64  Kbpscircuits from its regional offices to each of the stores in its region.andP;  Theneach of the regional offices could use its own 64 Kbps circuits to tie intothe corporate office.andP;  A special voice compression mux could them give them acentralized attendant release-loop trunk, two tie-lines and two data lines oneach circuit.andM;An oil-field services firm has a T-1 backbone network between its majorsites.andP;  Dedicated 56 Kbps circuits are used to connect smaller locations intothe T-1 network, letting the smaller sites gobble up the full array of dataservices available from the corporate mainframe.andM;And the medical applications are really neat.andP;  Say a hospital with a renownedpathology group installs switched 56 Kbps to other hospitals and doctorsoffices.andM;Special video cameras are used at the remote sites to photograph, digitizeand transmit the images back to the pathologists for diagnosis.andP;  Speciallymodified personal computers are programmed to receive and store the images sothe pathologists can view, zoom, pan and enlarge the pictures any way theirlittle hearts desire.andM;Yes, you can do a lot with the bandwidth, including saving lives.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
