Shakespeare, whose wisdom did not end with first, let'skill all the lawyers, knew that people who issue the loudestclaims also often know best that they're false. So it is withthe din of assurances by its proponents that the Civil RightsAct of 1991 could never ever result in race, sex andreligious quotas.   There is a lull before the battle resumes on thelegislation President Bush vetoed last year as a quota billand &quot;lawyers' bonanza.&quot; It's a good time to stand back andparse some of the legal technicalities to see why thereintroduced legislation would still force employers tochoose between quotas and ruinous lawsuits.   The civil-rights groups say they want to reverse fiverecent Supreme Court rulings. The Bush administration ishappy to overrule two cases, which excluded some lawsuitsover promotions and seniority. Mr. Bush says it would beunfair to reverse &quot;Martin v. Wilks&quot;, which said that peoplewho were not parties to consent decrees can sue if theysuffer from resulting racial quotas. There's also no reasonto reverse &quot;Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins&quot;, which said anemployer can somehow try to convince a court that it wouldhave made the same promotion decision even if it hadn't usedan unlawful factor such as sex.   The quota-inspiring change comes in provisions thatcivil-rights lawyers say would &quot;only&quot; reverse the case of&quot;Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio&quot;.   To understand what's at stake here, note that the countryhas come so far since the 1964 Civil Rights Act thatintentional discrimination is not the issue. The original lawbanned what civil-rights lawyers call &quot;disparate treatment&quot;;by now, most litigation is instead about &quot;disparate impact.&quot;This refers to the expansion of the civil-rights laws by theSupreme Court in the 1971 case of &quot;Griggs v. Duke Power&quot;,which said that hiring practices that appear fair can stillbe unlawful if they disproportionately harm one group, suchas where a utility company required educational degrees heldby many fewer blacks than whites. &quot;Wards Cove&quot; did notoverturn &quot;Griggs&quot;. The justices still welcomedisparate-impact cases based on statistical evidence withoutany evidence of intentional discrimination. What &quot;Wards Cove&quot;did was clarify that trial judges can recognize there arestatistics and then there are statistics -- and that onlyrelevant numerical evidence can prove &quot;disparate impact.&quot;&quot;Wards Cove&quot; itself showed the slipperiness of numbers games.The family-owned firm hired seasonal workers to process andpack salmon in its Alaska plants. Several minority workers,including Frank Atonio, a Samoan, claimed discrimination.Their evidence was that half of the plant's unskilled workerswere minorities, but that one-quarter of the skilled workerswere minorities. They argued that half the skilled workersshould also be minorities.   There were several problems with this claim. For onething, the relevant labor market in Alaska was 10%minorities. Under a strict statistical approach, Wards CovePacking probably hired &quot;too many&quot; skilled and unskilledminorities already. Also, many of the seasonal unskilledworkers were hired through a minority-run local of a union,which might explain the irony of minority over-representationas the basis for a discrimination lawsuit.   The Supreme Court used the case to clarify the rules fornumbers-based lawsuits: (1) Plaintiffs must identify aspecific hiring practice that has an adverse impact on aminority group; (2) once such a practice is identified, theemployer has the burden of showing that the practice &quot;servesin a significant way the legitimate employment goals of theemployer&quot;; and (3) if the employer can show a legitimatejustification for the hiring practice, plaintiffs can stillwin if they show that the employer could use other factorsthat don't disproportionately disqualify minorities.   The plaintiffs in &quot;Wards Cove&quot; lost, but worthy cases havewon under its three-part test. John Dunne, head of theJustice Department's civil-rights division, told Congressthis month about several of the winning cases. A teacher inAlabama was reinstated when a court found that minoritiesdisproportionately failed a teacher-certification test, analmost all-white New Jersey town had to drop itsresidents-only rule for public employees and Jacksonville,Fla., had to change its exam for firefighters.   The proposed civil-rights bill would go far beyondreversing &quot;Wards Cove&quot;. Plaintiffs would not have to identifyany single factor in hiring or promotion that the employercould then try to defend. The employer instead would have theentirely new task of proving the &quot;business necessity&quot; thatall the objective and subjective requirements for employment&quot;must bear a significant relationship to successfulperformance of the job.&quot; The phrase &quot;successful performance&quot;is especially vague.   Uncertain standards always promote litigiousness, but theproblem is especially severe here because the bill wouldreverse the usual due-process rules to presume that thedefendant is guilty until and unless he can prove himselfinnocent. If in doubt, a defendant is guilty of&quot;discrimination.&quot;   No employer can prove that every requirement for a job isnecessary for successful performance. No Wall Street law firmcan prove that only lawyers from Ivy League-type schools canpossibly do the job, for example. The law would also coverreligion, so employers would have to hire enough -- but nottoo many -- Catholics, Baptists, Jews, Muslims.   The proposed bill also goes beyond the 1964 civil-rightslaw, &quot;Griggs&quot; or &quot;Wards Cove&quot; by replacing the ideal ofmediation with the divisiveness of jury trials and punitivedamages. This year's bill as introduced by Rep. Jack Brookseven put back the provision dropped last year that wouldallow unlimited punitive damages. The bill's section callingfor punitive damages comes under the heading of damages for&quot;intentional discrimination,&quot; but in fact no intention isrequired. All that's needed is &quot;indifference to the federallyprotected rights of others,&quot; whatever that means.   Employers would be left in the position that JusticeSandra Day O'Connor warned against in a recent case limitingdisparate-impact cases. &quot;If quotas and preferential treatmentbecome the only cost-effective means of avoiding expensivelitigation and potentially catastrophic liability, suchmeasures will be widely adopted.&quot;   During the debate on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, HubertHumphrey said that the law guaranteed equal opportunity, andthat no court could &quot;require hiring, firing or promotion ofemployees to meet a racial `quota.'&quot; After all the lawsuitsdemanding goals, timetables and set-asides, any civil-rightsbill should pass a simple test: Congress should be bound byits provisions. As the bill now stands, Congress is the onlyinstitution in the country that Congress would exempt.</TEXT></DOC>
