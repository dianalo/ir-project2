Maariv, a leading Israeli daily newspaper, quoted the aides assaying Shamir may cancel his mid-November trip to Washington if thedivisions persist. One unidentified source in Shamir's office wasquoted as saying, ``We fear that differences of opinion between theprime minister and President Bush, if expressed face-to-face, willcause an explosion.''   However, Shamir said later on Israel army radio, ``I can onlystate there are some disagreements, they are not very sharp and I'mconvinced we can certainly overcome them.''   Speaking on Israel Television, Shamir denied the visit was indoubt. ``We're not running away from our views and the need toexpress them,'' he said. The exact dates of the trip have not beenannounced.   In another development, a senior aide to Finance Minister ShimonPeres said that leader's planned visit to the Soviet Union was indoubt. He indicated Kremlin officials have not responded torequests for top-level meetings.   In more unrest in the occupied territories Monday, Israelitroops shot and killed Mohammed Abu Libde, 19, and wounded at leastsix other people, Arab reports said.   The army confirmed the youth was killed during a militaryoperation at the West Bank refugee camp of Tulkarem.   The death brought to 601 the number of Palestinians killed byIsraeli gunfire in the 22-month-old uprising against Israelioccupation. Forty Israelis have been killed in the violence.   Shamir adviser Avi Pazner confirmed in a telephone interviewthat U.S. and Israeli officials were divided over how to carry outIsrael's proposal for elections in the occupied lands.   ``We hope this will all be straightened out before the meetingwith Bush,'' Pazner said.   Israel's plan calls for elections in the West Bank and GazaStrip to choose Palestinian representatives for negotiations onlimited self-rule for the territories. The status of the occupiedlands would be decided later.   The U.S.-Israeli differences stem from U.S. efforts to arrangean initial meeting with Palestinians to revive the stalled plan.   Shamir told the television the key points in dispute wereIsrael's insistance that no members of the Palestine LiberationOrganizations sit on a Palestinian delegation to talks and thatonly matters related to elections be discussed.   On Monday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the left-of-centerLabor Party opened a fresh Israeli debate about the plan ofSecretary of State James A. Baker III, saying Israel wasconsidering it despite Shamir's objections.   Speaking to high school students in suburban Tel Aviv, he saidBaker's proposals ``have not been rejected or accepted'' and shouldbe considered by the Cabinet.   Shamir also came under fire Monday from the other side of thepolitical spectrum. Ariel Sharon, Shamir's rival in the hard-lineLikud bloc, said Shamir had told Americans one thing and Israelissomething different.   ``This has been a dangerous road from the beginning,'' he said.``There's no place for a conflict with the United States, and Ithink there would have been no conflict if we spoke clearly.''   The Peres aide, meanwhile, said Peres would make a finaldecision in mid-November about whether to make his trip to Moscow.The aide, Nimrod Novick, returned to Israel this week after tryingto work out details of the trip, which has not yet been scheduled.   Peres has been invited to Moscow by the non-governmental SovietPeace Committee. However, the minister, who also serves as LaborParty leader, is reportedly seeking a meeting with PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev or Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   Peres is currently in a hospital recovering from a urinaryinfection.</TEXT></DOC>
