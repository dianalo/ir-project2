Ron Millertold you about that earlier in the week.;    On NBC, you have the story of themysterious death of movie star Thelma Todd, called &quot;White Hot,&quot; which Millerwill detail in Sunday's TV book.;    Which leaves me to spill the beans aboutthe third big movie of the evening, CBS's &quot;Victim of Love,&quot; an even whiter-hotflick with JoBeth Williams and Pierce Brosnan raising the temperatures in afar-fetched yarn featuring all the skin the network will allow, i.e., arms,legs and backs galore.;    &quot;I've forgotten what you look like with clotheson,&quot; she says to him in one of the many birthday-suit scenes.;    Obviouslyshe hasn't been watching her &quot;Remington Steele&quot; reruns, since her partner herebears (and bares) a remarkable resemblance to the well-clothed chap there.;   But all that epidermis and the ending, which leaves you knowing what happenedbut wondering what will happen next, are the best parts of the oftenunbelievable script by Tim Kring and Alison and James Desmarais.;    Whatmakes &quot;Victim of Love&quot; unbelievable is what a dunderhead the Williamscharacter, a therapist named Tess Parker, becomes whenever Brosnan'scharacter, a slick professor named Paul Tomlinson, is around.;    The twist inthis tale is that Tess is treating a young woman named Carla (VirginiaMadsen), who can't get over a guy she's been seeing for three years (two whilehe was married). Now he won't marry her, even though his wife is dead.;    Atthe same time Tess is hearing all this, she meets a dark, handsome stranger ata party, who sweeps her right off her feet and onto the beach.;    &quot;He'sprobably an unemployed actor with a mother fixation,&quot; she tells herself infront of a mirror after their first encounter. &quot;God, I hope his mother was aredhead.&quot;;    We don't know, but does anyone want to bet that his lastgirlfriend was Carla, Tess's patient, who has become suicidal over this guy?;   Which is where things get really interesting and really stupid. Instead ofbelieving her patient, whom she presumably has known for some time, shebelieves Mr. Tall, Dark and Handsome, whom she's just met, about the status ofhis relationship with Carla.;    He says that he does know her, but she'ssuffering from delusions, stealing things from his home to back up herfantasies.;    &quot;I'm so confused, I really believe you,&quot; Tess tells him, whichis true, because only a genuinely confused person would believe him.;    Untilnear the end, when there is more than a flicker of doubt about which one ofthese sickies to believe.;    Brosnan is terrific in the snake's role, and itis easy to see why women fall for both him and his character. He is all thosethings most girls' mothers tell them to stay away from, but they can't.;   More than a little steam rises from his scenes with Williams -- and not justwhen he runs an ice cube up her hot leg a la &quot;9 1/2 Weeks.&quot;;    But for mostof the way, this is just another damsel-in-distress flick, in large partbecause this particular damsel seems to have lost her senses. This is one ofthose movies where you keep talking to the screen, telling her, &quot;Don't dothat.&quot; But she does it anyway.;    The thing is: Even with its faults, &quot;Victimof Love&quot; is probably the strongest of the three network offerings, which saysa lot about the weak competition.;    END NOTES -- ABC experiments with liveentertainment for the stay-at-home set tonight with &quot;American Saturday Night,&quot;an hourlong tour (10 p.m., Chs. 7, 11, 13) of music and clubbery with RichardLewis. Even though he's hilarious, I'm not sure it will work. But if it does,&quot;ASN&quot; could become a weekly show. That would be good for Lewis, since ABCseems intent on killing &quot;Anything But Love&quot; for reasons that escape me. . . .;   He's not the most objective fellow on the subject, but KQED president TonyTiano, whose board of directors gave up the fight for KQEC (Ch. 32) last week,says the new owners will have a tough time achieving their goal of makingtheir station look different from the other three PBS stations in the area.;   &quot;We have more public television service here than anywhere in the country,&quot;he says. &quot;You have to put on programs people enjoy and support. I think it'sgoing to wind up looking an awful lot like the others in the area.&quot; . . .;   And from the local-boy-makes-good file, it should be noted that PaulStojanovich, creator of &quot;American Detective,&quot; which debuted on ABC this week,was a South Bay news cameraman for years at KRON (Ch. 4). The beginning of theend for him there came when he was bopped on the head by a bottle chucked fromthe crowd at a 49er Super Bowl victory parade.;    He also worked with GeraldoRivera on the live drug-bust show of four years ago, which seemed to triggerall this police-reality on the tube, including CBS's &quot;Cops,&quot; of whichStojanovich was a producer before coming up with &quot;American Detective.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  David Rosenthal column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910504  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  952  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 4, 199100125093,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
