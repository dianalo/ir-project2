Bond funds, especially short-term bond funds, may be thebiggest beneficiaries of the $8.8 billion individuals havepulled out of taxable money funds since mid-March.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We haven't seen flows like this . . . since the spring of1987,&quot; says Neal Litvack, marketing vice president atFidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual-fund giant. &quot;Itclearly represents conservative money looking for higheryields than money funds are providing.&quot;   Some of the money is also going into stocks, helping tofuel the market rally that pushed the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage over the 3,000 mark last month. Sales of stock mutualfunds were brisk in March and early April, and are continuingat a healthy pace, fund managers say.   &quot;People are looking for alternatives,&quot; says John Markese,research director for the American Association of IndividualInvestors in Chicago. &quot;The spread between inflation rates andmoney-fund rates is getting close to zero.&quot;   The average yield on money funds began the year at morethan 7%. But after weeks of decline, it's now down to 5.74%.That's almost as anemic as the 5.5% passbook-savings rate,and yields on such no-risk alternatives as short-term bankcertificates of deposit and Treasury bills are alsodisappointing.   The low returns have encouraged some recession-waryinvestors to pay down debts. Government agencies reported abig leap in mortgage prepayments in April, far beyond theusual seasonal increase. And some money-fund withdrawalsprobably went to pay income taxes, which is typical at thistime of year.   But investors have also shown more willingness to take onrisk in pursuit of higher returns. To some extent, that's agood thing, financial professionals say. Money funds, theysay, should be just one part of an investment portfolio.   They caution, though, that investors should be aware ofwhat they're doing. &quot;It's a major mistake not to take intoaccount that there's a lot more risk&quot; if investors hope to&quot;maintain parity with what they used to get&quot; on money funds,says Victor Sperandeo, president of Rand Management, amoney-management firm in Short Hills, N.J.   If interest rates turn up, investors may wish they'd leftsome money in a money fund. And if the stock market falls 10%or 20% in three months, they might want some cash on hand totake advantage of lower prices. &quot;People need to think aboutwhat their objectives are,&quot; says Kurt Brouwer, a SanFrancisco investment adviser. &quot;The time when you feel thepressure to make a move is probably the wrong time.&quot;   Indeed, financial professionals say that if the cash inyour money fund is your short-term emergency fund, or if youexpect to need it within six months or a year, you'reprobably better off leaving it where it is. &quot;Five-and-a-halfper cent is nothing to write home about, but it sure beatsbuying stocks at the top of the market and watching the valueof your principal erode,&quot; says Thomas S. Bjornstad, afinancial planner in Elkhart, Ind.   For those who do feel ready to test the alternatives,here's a look at some that money managers are nowrecommending:                                                                                                          Short-Term Bond Funds. When money-fund investors golooking for higher yields, one of the first things they willfind is that other investments don't offer the fixed assetvalue they're used to. But short-term bond funds may be areasonable alternative. Because these funds typically investin securities maturing in one to five years, compared with ayear or less for money funds, the share price doesn't varymuch in response to market fluctuations.   But because the so-called yield curve is now fairly steep,with long-term interest rates significantly higher thanshort-term rates, even a marginal increase in maturityresults in a higher yield. For instance, while the yield onthree-month Treasury bills is currently just a little over5.5%, the yield on three-year Treasury notes is about 7%.   Moreover, as interest rates have fallen in recent months,the price of short-term bonds has increased -- boosting thetotal return on the mutual funds that buy them.   Mutual fund companies report that there's a great deal ofinvestor interest in short-term bond funds that invest ingovernment securities. Mr. Litvack of Fidelity says thatcompany's Spartan Limited Maturity Government Fund has morethan doubled in assets since the start of the year.                                                                                                          Intermediate-Term Treasurys. The yield on 10-year Treasurynotes is currently just over 8% and Treasurys are guaranteedby the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, acomforting thought for investors used to low-risk moneyfunds.   Investors who need the money in the interim can sell onthe secondary market. While the price of the bonds may fallif interest rates rise, there's far less price volatilitythan on 30-year bonds, which are yielding only about a fifthof a percentage point more.   &quot;For a conservative investor, they're a pretty good bet,&quot;says Ken Gregory, editor of L/G No-Load Fund Analyst, a SanFrancisco-based newsletter. If interest rates fall further,he adds, the price of the bonds will rise, so &quot;there'spractically no risk.&quot;                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds. Yields on munis haven't fallen nearly asmuch as on other investments, and they're tax-free, to boot.As measured by an index of 40 municipal bonds compiled by theBond Buyer, a trade publication, muni yields are now about7.25%, compared with 7.66% a year ago. That's equal to about10.5% for someone paying 31% in taxes, which is even a littlebetter than the 10% or so annual return on stocks over thelong term.   But with a number of states and local governments facingfiscal troubles, it pays to be careful. &quot;Diversify,&quot; says Mr.Sperandeo of Rand Management. &quot;Don't have everything in onestate.&quot;                                                                                                          Junk Bond Funds. Yes, junk bonds, those high-yieldinglow-rated securities that have gotten such a bad name in thelast couple of years.   Stick to the funds that invest in issues rated just belowinvestment grade, financial professionals advise. &quot;They'revery undervalued,&quot; says Norman Fosback, editor of severalFort Lauderdale, Fla.-based investment newsletters. &quot;Thedefault rate has been grossly exaggerated.&quot;   The 85 junk funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services,which tracks mutual fund performance, posted the highesttotal return of any group of mutual funds in the firstquarter -- a whopping 14.11%.                                                                                                          One Other Alternative. If none of this is appealing,here's something to consider that's totally risk-free: Takesome of that money earning less than 6% in a money fund anduse it to pay off that credit-card balance that's costing you18% a year. You're guaranteed to come out ahead.</TEXT></DOC>
