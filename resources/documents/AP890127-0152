Only Romania, increasingly isolated in the Soviet bloc, has notmade a similar announcement.   Czechoslovakia said Friday it will cut defense spending by 15percent and trim its armed forces by 12,000 men, 850 tanks, 165armored vehicles and 51 fighter planes in the next two years.   Hours later, the Bulgarian state news agency announced the StateCouncil and government approved a motion from Communist leader TodorZhivkov to reduce the country's 1989 defense budget by 12 percentand its armed forces by 10,000 men.   By 1991, Bulgaria also will scrap 200 tanks, 200 artillerysystems, 20 aircraft and five naval units, BTA said withoutelaborating.   According to NATO, Bulgaria has 135,000 men under arms andCzechoslovakia 145,000.   East Germany, Hungary and Poland all have announced cuts inmilitary manpower and spending, following the lead of SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev who said Dec. 7 he would reduce theRed Army by half a million men by 1991.   The cuts seem designed to boost new NATO-Warsaw Pact talks onreducing conventional troops and weapons across Europe, to open inVienna in March.   They also benefit the Communist governments by freeing funds forsorely needed economic reforms and by creating pressure for NATO tofollow suit with cuts of its own.   A spokesman at the Western military alliance's Brusselsheadquarters said Thursday the recently announced Soviet blocreductions still leave a ``great imbalance'' in Europe, with Westernground troops outnumbered almost 2-1.   CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, billed the measuresas a unilateral contribution to boost confidence and security inEurope. Prague would contemplate more cuts if the West follows theEast's lead in cutting men and armaments, it said.   The Czechoslovak army's reserve force would lose 15,000 men andthe number of divisions involved in military maneuvers and tacticalexercises would be halved, according to CTK.   It said 20,000 soldiers now on active duty would be transferredto army construction brigades, while the equipment for three moredivisions would be put into storage and most men from thosedivisions diverted to other duties.   The cuts in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary are inaddition to those announced by Gorbachev, who told the UnitedNations on Dec. 7 that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 Soviet tankswould be withdrawn from those nations.   Soviet defense officials have said partial withdrawal could beginas soon as April.   East Germany has said it would cut its armed forces by 10,000soldiers and reduce defense spending by 10 percent. It also willscrap 600 tanks and 50 warplanes.   Hungary already has cut its military budget by 17 percent in realterms from 1988, and in December announced plans to retire more than50 top officers who are over 60 years old, including 10 generals.   Poland said it has reduced its army by 15,000 men during the pasttwo years and would dissolve two divisions in 1989 and reduce twomore by 85 percent.   It also said its military budget for 1989 is $1.9 billion,representing 3.6 percent of this year's national income compared tothe 1988 budget's 3.8 percent of the year's national income.</TEXT></DOC>
