Saudi Arabia's Hisham Nazer fended off questions about increasesin the output ceiling of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   ``We will see when we meet because I haven't seen any of mycolleagues yet,'' he told reporters.   Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Ecuador's Diego Tamariz andVenezuela's Celestino Armas also were early arrivals at the luxuryhotel where OPEC does much of its behind-the-scenes bargaining.   Tamariz said he thought there was room for a fresh increase inOPEC's production ceiling, but offered no figure. The cartel'squota is 20.5 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989.   The ministers were to continue arriving through Thursday, whenthe cartel's monitoring committee was to meet. Although only eightministers are members of the panel, all were expected to attend,officials said.   OPEC's formal winter meeting will begin on Saturday, one of twoconferences held annually.   The ministers' discussions could lead to a new productionagreement that will help determine OPEC's supply of crude to worldmarkets next year.   Analysts estimate the cartel produced more than 23 millionbarrels a day last month, well over the current cap of 20.5 millionbarrels.   Despite the flood of oil, prices have remained fairly stable inrecent months helped by unexpectedly higher demand for OPEC crude,mainly from developing countries.   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkAmerican grade, have fluctuated in the $19 to $20-a-barrel range.Middle Eastern varieties run several dollars a barrel less.   The average price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was $17.76 abarrel last week, just under the cartel's price target of $18 abarrel. Only a year ago, the basket of crudes was priced at $12.34a barrel.   In their discussions, the ministers will have to figure out howmuch they can produce next year and still keep prices firm, orbetter yet, slightly higher to meet the cartel's target price.   The International Energy Agency, made up of 24 Western nations,estimates demand in the first half of 1990 at slightly under 21million barrels a day, more than 2 million barrels under what thecartel is now producing.   In the face of lower demand, the producing nations would have totrim output to keep the market and prices steady and restorediscipline among those members who have been openly violating theirquotas.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been producing morethan 2 million barrels a day, about double their individualallotments, to press their demands for bigger shares of thecartel's production pie, according to analysts.   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer and the world's largestcrude exporter, also recently began exceeding its allocation, amove seen by analysts as a negotiating tactic before this week'stalks.   At a September meeting, the ministers discussed a plan presentedby Iran that addressed the sensitive issue of redistributingproduction shares among the 13 nations.   The plan called for lifting the supply cap to 21.5 millionbarrels a day to meet the demands of Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates for larger shares. Gabon and Ecuador would also get moreunder the proposal.   Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria and Venezuela would lose some oftheir percentage shares as would Iran and Iraq. Saudi Arabia, Libyaand Qatar would maintain their current levels, according to theplan.</TEXT></DOC>
