They are among thousands who have become the first in history toflee one Soviet bloc nation for another. Hungary took theunprecedented step in January of refusing to send these people backto their homeland.   Most refugees are ethnic Hungarians from Transylvania, a regionof mountains and forests disputed for centuries between Hungary andRomania and ruled by Romania since 1918.   Hungary's decision to let the refugees stay has unleashed acharity effort unseen in Soviet bloc history. Budapest firms haveoffered at least 7,000 jobs. Clothing pours into churches and RedCross offices, even from abroad.   As refugees sift through old clothes and wait for work or smallcash handouts, many tell dramatic tales.   A young father who abandoned his child in Romania beseeches aWestern reporter for help. He spends hours, he says, peering acrossthe border from eastern Hungary and contemplating a mad dash to gethis 18-month-old baby.   A teacher sobs as she realizes that her pupils will wait in vainfor her to return from what was supposed to be a short trip toHungary.   On Hungarian TV, a couple touch the nation with their account offleeing from Romania by wading through marshes under cover ofdarkness.   Hungary claims that under Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu,the culture of Transylvania's estimated 2 million Hungarians,Europe's largest ethnic minority, is systematically being squeezedout of existence.   This alleged oppression and the hardships of day-to-day life inshortage-plagued Romania have pushed as many as 20,000 to use shortvisits to stay in Hungary.   A few hundred ethnic Romanians have also made the dash throughHungary's open door, driven by what they describe as extremeprivation.   ``For a family of four, I got 200 grams (7 ounces) of butter amonth,'' said Cornel Rosca, an economist from Timisoara. ``My dreamin Romania was to eat a roast chicken, which I didn't have for ninemonths.''   Ethnic Hungarians interviewed charged they were increasinglydiscriminated against in housing, jobs and education in the lastfew years.   The plight of the ethnic Hungarians has touched a nerve inHungary, which is accused by Romania of whipping up sentiment overTransylvania in order to reclaim the region.   Budapest students tell of groups of women who marry ethnicHungarians in Romania to get them out. Other youngsters journey toRomania with foodstuffs for relatives or acquaintances.   A fund set up in March to aid refugees amassed $24,000 in lessthan a month despite Hungary's economic crisis.   For ethnic Romanians it is harder to obtain the work andresidence permits given to ethnic Hungarians to settle. Most ofthem want to move on to the West, seeing countries like visa-freeSweden as an initial goal.   Even if they have tickets, however, like engineers MariaChiorean and Teodor Petrus, they find themselves stopped at theHungarian border.   This shows Hungary's delicate position as a refuge for peoplefrom another Warsaw Pact nation. As dissident critic SandorSzilagyi puts it, ``It is unimaginable for the comrades that thereexist refugees from a Socialist society.''   His unofficial group helping refugees has urged that a UnitedNations' office be set up in Budapest to handle the refugees,organize emigration to the West and reunite parents with spousesand children still in Romania.   So far Hungary has rejected the idea of foreign aid and refusesofficially even to use the word ``refugee'' to describe the newarrivals.   ``The best solution would be for them to stay at home, even ifthey have temporary difficulties,'' said Interior Ministry officialLaszlo Albrecht.   If more refugees do come, however, Hungary's policy may have tochange, and the popular welcome may run out.   Hungary may also be forced to seek international help inreuniting an estimated 2,000 children with parents. The HungarianRed Cross says it will write to its Romanian counterpart about thechildren this month.   But pastor Geza Nemeth, a main mover behind church aid forrefugees, bluntly tells refugee parents who leave children behindto return to Romania.   ``No pastor is going to help a mother who abandons her child,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
