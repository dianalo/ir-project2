Analysts say the main beneficiaries are likely to be Deere andamp; Co. and Varity Corp., the two biggest companies that depend heavily on farm-equipment sales.    &quot;The farm economy is on the upswing, and Deere is the dominant player. Anything that's positive for farmers should be positive for Deere,&quot; says Steven Colbert, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.    &quot;The signs point to a (farm) recovery. If there is, Varity is one stock that will do well,&quot; says George Dahlman, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood. Varity was formerly known as Massey-Ferguson.    There are still some skeptics, such as Brian Chesnut, an analyst with Richardson Greenshields of Canada, who says he doubts that better agricultural times are at hand. &quot;I haven't seen anything that would substantiate it,&quot; he says. Richard Kodl, an economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, says a reduction of farm acreage &quot;goes against the grain of a long-term rebound in equipment sales.&quot;    But for true believers, signs that the farm economy is about to do better -- including higher sales of tractors and other machinery -- are sprouting everywhere. They include firmer farm prices, record-level farm net income, expectations of higher U.S. grain exports, lower farm debt, and reduced operating costs among farmers who have weathered the tide of farm bankruptcies.    Investors drove the share prices of Deere and Varity to their 52-week highs before October's market crash, which stripped about 30% from the market value of each. Deere closed yesterday at 30, down from its 52-week high of 43. Varity finished yesterday at 2 1/4, off from the peak of 3 3/8 Oct. 9. Bulls think the sharp price drops present an opportunity for longerterm investors to buy.    October sales of two-wheel-drive tractors, which account for most farm-equipment sales, rose about 3% from the year-earlier month, according to the Chicago-based Farm and Industrial Equipment Institute, an industry association. That's the fourth consecutive monthly gain. The institute forecasts a 3% gain next year, which would be the first year-to-year increase since 1979. Combined sales in September and October also exceeded 1986 levels, the institute reports.    Prudential-Bache's Mr. Colbert says new tractor inventories were reduced to a 6.5-month supply at October's end from a 10-month supply early in the year. He forecasts U.S. tractor sales to rise close to 10% next year and further cut inventory, setting the stage for a price increase of 5% to 10% in 1988. Thomas Burns Jr., an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York, sees farm-equipment prices rising 3% next year.    Piper Jaffray's Mr. Dahlman concedes that the recent rise in tractor sales was largely the result of discounting by Tenneco Inc.'s Case-IH unit. Case-IH ranks second to Deere in the farm-equipment sector, but accounts for only about 23% of Tenneco's sales. Farm equipment accounts for about 50% of Varity's sales and about 70% of Deere's.    Prudential-Bache's Mr. Colbert says Deere's monthly sales also rose. &quot;This is a replacement market, and farmers who have to go out and buy new equipment will,&quot; he says. &quot;Replacement demand is high,&quot; agrees David Sutliff, analyst with Salomon Brothers, New York. He says sales are rising &quot;mostly because there is more cash&quot; in farmers' hands.    Deere and Varity became much leaner during the bad years. Varity's work force shrank by almost three-quarters between 1978 and 1987. Goldman Sach's Mr. Burns says Deere can break even at 35% of capacity utilization, down from 75% in 1981. At a utilization level of 50% to 60%, Mr. Burns says, Deere could earn $6 a share.    Assuming 35% capacity utilization for Deere in fiscal 1988, Mr. Burns forecasts earnings of $135.6 million to $169.5 million, or $2 to $2.50 a share, after an estimated net loss of $157.3 million for the year ended Oct. 31.    Mr. Colbert of Prudential-Bache sees net income of $1.90 a share for Deere in fiscal 1988. Deere reported a $229.3 million loss for fiscal 1986.    For the year ending Jan. 31, 1988, Piper Jaffray's Mr. Dahlman expects Varity to earn $41.8 million, or 15 cents a share, after paying preferred share dividends. That's despite a first-half loss of $17.6 million. He forecasts net income of 30 cents to 40 cents a share in 1988. Varity reported a loss of $23.3 million the previous year.    Mitchell Quain, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., New York, says Varity &quot;doesn't have the North American exposure I'd like to see&quot; for it to gain from a big upturn in U.S. farm-equipment sales. Varity sells most of its tractors overseas. But Mr. Dahlman says Varity could shift its marketing focus quickly if U.S. sales continue to rise. </TEXT></DOC>
