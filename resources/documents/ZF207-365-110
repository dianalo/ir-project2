 IBM has settleda patent infringement suit out of court by purchasing a patent, which couldbe broadly interpreted to cover most publishing systems on the market today.andO;We felt it desirable to avoid prior mention of this matter because JohnSeybold had agreed to testify with respect to &quot;prior art&quot; and felt itinappropriate, under those circumstances, to make any public comments.andM;In the early 1970s, a group founded by Arnold Berkeley, a patent attorney,developed a special-purpose piece of word processing equipment.andP;  Berkeleyreceived a patent on the basis of a series of broad claims that may or maynot have covered the use of control codes consisting of characters generallyavailable on a typewriter-like keyboard that invoked various processes, suchas text input, editing or printing--in short, what are commonly known asmenus on today's systems.andP;  The patent in question was granted to Berkeleypursuant to a patent application filed in 1969.andP;  The patent was issued in1972, and its 17-year lifespan will expire in the fall of this year.andM;In 1987 the case was filed by &quot;Berkeley Limited Partnership,&quot; a Rockville,Maryland-based group formed for the express purpose, as we understand it, ofseeking royalties for alleged patent infringement.andP;  Other manufacturers ofhardware and software had been notified by Berkeley that they, too, wereconsidered to be in violation of the patent and liable for the payment ofsignificant royalties.andM;Frivolous claims.andP;  Those who read the patent claims were surprised that thePatent Office granted the patent in the first place.andP;  It seemed quite clearto John Seybold, for example, that prior art, well-established before 1969,incorporated all of the features--and more--that the patent sought toaddress.andP;  Rocappi included technology that went far beyond that described inthe patent claims, and Seybold felt that IBM's Datatext or AdministrativeText Management System, widely used as early as 1965, also represented priorart, as did the software of the RCA Graphic Systems Division and othersimilar applications programs for the IBM 1130, RCA 301 and Digital EquipmentPDP-8 computers.andM;John Seybold formed the Rocappi typesetting company in 1963, well before theRCA Graphic Systems Division was launched, but subsequent to the developmentof single-pass, paper-tape oriented batch processing composition programs forthe IBM 1620.andP;  At the time, programming ideas of a general nature were widelyborrowed with no thought of patent protection or litigation.andP;  JonathanSeybold found it ironic that the very patent issued in the Berkeley case wasprobably input, typeset, and printed by technology developed by a FortWashington, Pennsylvania-based company that clearly could not have performedthese services for the Patent Office had such &quot;prior art&quot; not existed.andM;To indicate its opinion that the claims were frivolous, IBM filed acountersuit for treble damages under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations (RICO) Act, alleging that the inventors and their patentattorney attempted to extort money from IBM by trying to force it to licenseBerkeley's technology.andP;  However, according to an article in The Daily Record(a Maryland legal and business publication), a federal magistrate recommendedin October 1988 that the RICO claim be dismissed.andP;  That recommendation waspresumably based on findings with respect to the motives of the Berkeleypartners, rather than the validity of their claims.andM;The Daily Record went on to comment that &quot;the magnitude of the litigationcame to light last summer when it was learned that IBM had subleased over33,000 square feet of office space,&quot; expecting that for some part of theone-year lease its attorneys would &quot;use some or all of that space inconnection with the Berkeley litigation.&quot;andP;  Improvements had been made to theleased property--desks moved in, PCs and telephones installed--and staffmoved in before the settlement was reached.andM;That same article reported that Berkeley Partners were seeking more than $100million in lost royalties as well as an injunction preventing IBM frommanufacturing and selling its personal computers until Berkeley's patentexpired on October 31, 1989.andM;Edward Goldstein, of the Houston firm of Arnold, White andamp; Durkee, evidentlyinformed The Daily Record that the dispute arose in 1984 when Arnold Berkeleyread about the logic incorporated into the IBM Personal Computer in PeterNorton's book Inside the IBM PC.andP;  According to John Seybold, it would appearthat any software application involving a menu offering processing optionsmight have been held to infringe on the patent.andM;Court battle averted.andP;  While employees of Seybold Publications do theirutmost to avoid getting themselves involved, presumably as expert witnesses,in such legal matters, John and Jonathan felt so strongly about what theycall &quot;the outrageous nature&quot; of the claims that they agreed to testify andJohn provided a deposition.andP;  Other old-timers likewise agreed to take part,but the case was settled out of court when IBM agreed to purchase the patentin question for an undisclosed sum.andP;  While we have not been informed of theamount of the settlement, we believe that, while it was substantial, it wassignificantly less than the cost had litigation continued.andM;Although IBM found it expedient to purchase the domestic and foreign patentsto assure its own protection, the industry as a whole benefits by IBM'spurchase, because IBM considers the claims utterly frivolous and has nointention of pursuing the patent infringement allegations against othervendors.andM;Attorneys in the case for IBM included the New York firm of Cravath, Swaine andamp;Moore, special patent counsel from Cella, Harper andamp; Scinto and the Baltimorefirm of Tydings andamp; Rosenberg.andM;As we understand such litigation, after extensive argument had taken placethe decision would have been made by a six-person jury selected from thegeneral public, unschooled in patent law or technology.andP;  Had that jury beensympathetic with the litigating &quot;underdog,&quot; and awarded accordingly, anappeal might then have been taken to a special panel in District Court, whereexperts presumably would have had an opportunity to review the decision,several years and perhaps more millions of dollars down the road.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
