SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Parliament voted to change the country'sofficial name Friday and to eliminate the constitutional provisionguaranteeing the Communist Party's leading role in the goverment.   The constitutional changes were adopted 374-1 with 11abstentions. The majority of the lawmakers immediately rose andbegan to sing the national anthem.   The move changes the nation's Communist-imposed name, thePeople's Republic of Poland, to the pre-World War II Republic ofPoland.   The amendments incorporate into the constitution the reforms wonby the Solidarity-led opposition movement, which won partially freeelections in June and assumed dominance of the government in August.   Soviet-backed Polish communists changed the country's name tothe People's Republic of Poland when they proclaimed a newgovernment on July 22, 1944, while the country was still ravaged bywar.   Both Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime MinisterTadeusz Mazowiecki, head of the Solidarity-dominated government,were present for the evening debate on the constitutionalamendments.   The amendments eliminated the phrase that mandated the leadingrole of the Communist Party in state affairs and changed a phrasethat called Poland a ``socialist society'' to a ``citizens'society.''   The pre-war crown that graced the head of the eagle on thenational emblem also was restored. The crown symbolizes Polishsovereignty and unity.   The amendments also introduced a provision giving citizens theright to create political parties and other organizations. Untilnow, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and the PeasantParty were officially the only legally recognized parties in Poland.   Also introduced was a clause guaranteeing protection of privateproperty.   The amendments were adopted following a daylong debate, withlawmakers often haggling over one or two words.   Earlier, Cardinal Jozef Glemp wished lawmakers strength Fridayfor the hard tasks ahead. It was the first visit by a Polishprimate to Parliament in the country's Communist history.   Glemp met with senators and members of all politicalorientations in the Sejm, as the lower house of Parliament iscalled, during a midday break in debate over amendments to theconstitution and a possible change in the country's national emblem.   The lawmakers sang traditional Polish Christmas carols as Glempentered the building. ``I address all gathered here with greatrespect and I would like to express my frank, patriotic and heartywishes,'' Glemp told the lawmakers.   ``I wish you enough strength for the coming year and that thelink between the nation and the parliament will become stronger andmeet with greater understanding. Please accept those best wishesfrom the church of which I am an abject servant,'' he said.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa used a series of strikes to forcethe Communists to the bargaining table this year, winningguarantees for a role in the government in exchange for cooperationon Poland's economic problems.   But popular support for Solidarity among the masses andrepudiation of the Communists forced them to ultimately grant theopposition a dominant role in the government. Reform movementssubsequently swept the rest of the East bloc, toppling the oldguard Communist governments in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, EastGermany, Bulgaria and Romania.</TEXT></DOC>
