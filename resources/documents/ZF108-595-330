(table)PC Week poll: word-processing packages retailing for $300-$600.andO;(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Closely Vying Word Processors All Have Their PointsandM;&quot;All PCs should have word-processing packages installed on them--even thosein the accounting department,&quot; declared Pamela Hauth, a management systemsengineer for West Valley Nuclear Services Co., a division of WestinghouseCorp. that cleans up nuclear waste for the Department of Energy.andM;Everyone seems to have a word-processing package they swear by, whetherthey're end users who have substituted software for a favorite pen, or volumebuyers who must attempt to bypass personal idiosyncrasies and focus on suchbroader corporate concerns as reliability, output flexibility and fileimport/export ease.andM;This week's Poll of Corporate Satisfaction explores corporate buyers'preferences and purchasing influences for stand-alone word-processingpackages that retail for $300 to $600.andM;Many of the buyers PC Week spoke with support various brands of wordprocessors.andP;  When asked why, J. Douglas Crowder, senior PC LAN consultant atHughes Aircraft Co., which supports all seven packages included in the Poll,said:  &quot;We inherited this mess.andP;  Someone in a group or organization says,'Oh, I like MultiMate--that's what I know,' and then everyone in that groupuses it.andM;&quot;All of sudden, what you've got is large concentrations of people using apackage.andP;  They're trained and know what they're doing.andP;  They're working onimportant stuff,&quot; so no one wants to force them to adopt a new package atthat point, he explained.andM;Close Scoring Among ContendersandM;Given the mission-critical nature of the application, close competition amongindustrial-strength word-processing packages comes as little surprise.andM;Indeed, of the seven packages included in the Poll, the four highest-scoringproducts fall within five points of each other.andP;  Further, each achieved atleast one top score among the 11 product traits used by buyers as a basis forrating the products.andM;&quot;Within my department, everybody likes a different package,&quot; said KristinVachuda, an analyst for the marketing arm of Texaco Inc. who supports AmiProfessional, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and DisplayWrite.andP;  &quot;There aredifferent ones for different needs.&quot;andM;&quot;Some are good at some things.andP;  For example, Ami Professional works well withmy other Windows packages,&quot; Vachuda said.andP;  &quot;Each package has somethingdifferent that we like about it.&quot;andM;The top score of 81 went to Ami Professional 1.1 from Samna Corp. of Atlanta,followed closely by WordPerfect 5.1 from WordPerfect Corp. of Orem, Utah,Word 5.0 from Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash., and XyWrite III Plus 3.55from XyQuest Inc. of Billerica, Mass.andM;Four points later came OfficeWriter 6.1, from Software Publishing Corp. inMountain View, Calif., which outscored MultiMate 4.0 from Ashton-Tate ofTorrance, Calif., by another four points.andP;  DisplayWrite 4.0 from IBM inArmonk, N.Y., scored lowest overall, nine points under the next-higher scoreand 22 points less than the highest overall score.andM;WordStar 6.0 from WordStar International Corp. and Samna Word IV 3.0 fromSamna Corp. had not been on the market long enough for inclusion in thisPoll.andM;Different StrengthsandM;&quot;Ami Professional is the most flexible with graphics, but not everyone usesgraphics,&quot; said a microcomputer support manager for a Fortune 100 company whoasked not to be identified.andM;&quot;Word is better with graphics than WordPerfect, but it's not as flexible asAmi.andP;  Ami users like the interface--it's easy to use,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;However,WordPerfect is faster than Ami.andP;  Word is the easiest in terms of itsdocumentation.&quot;andM;&quot;I like WordPerfect because of the different fonts it lets you use withinit,&quot; said Texaco's Vachuda.andP;  &quot;I like the split screen where you can see allthe commands written out below.&quot;andP;  She also acknowledged that &quot;it's hard tolearn.andP;  You have to memorize the keys for specific functions.andP;  I prefer Ami.andO;It's easier to remember.&quot;andM;&quot;I'd go with WordPerfect,&quot; said Crowder, of Hughes Aircraft.andP;  &quot;It has thebest support of anybody.andP;  Ninety-nine percent of the time, its technicalsupport has resolved any problem we've brought up.andP;  Word is a pretty goodproduct too.&quot;andM;Reliability Ranks HighestandM;More than 1,100 corporate buyers responded to the Poll, citing overallreliability as the central influence on the purchase decision.andP;  Close behindthat concern was overall performance, the ease of using the user interface,and text-formatting capability and flexibility of output.andM;&quot;To me, reliability means that if I push the buttons and follow theinstructions, the package will do what it's supposed to do.andP;  I haven't foundany word-processing programs that have crashed,&quot; said the microcomputersupport manager.andM;In addition, he calls a package reliable if &quot;a change made in one placedoesn't screw me up in another place.andP;  Also, foolproofness is another elementof reliability.andP;  I like programs that don't allow a user to send a file offinto space,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;It either works or it doesn't,&quot; said Hauth, of West Valley Nuclear Services.andO;&quot;Our current concern is the ability to move files between differentword-processing packages.&quot;andM;Crowder has a slightly different view:  &quot;Ease of use is most important.andP;  Ithas to be something I can get a user into, and get him going quickly.&quot;andM;&quot;Ease of use is definitely important, near the top of my list,&quot; agreed themicrocomputer support manager.andM;&quot;I can't have it failing on me,&quot; said Vachuda.andP;  &quot;Speed is another thing tothink about, and importing files and graphics is also important.&quot;andM;Documentation Isn't TrivialandM;With scores in the upper 80s, clarity of documentation and completeness andorganization of documentation were cited by buyers as among the heavierimpacts on the purchase decision.andM;&quot;Product documentation should be good,&quot; said Vachuda.andP;  &quot;I think Samna [makerof Ami Professional] did a pretty good job with it.&quot;andM;Interestingly, the products did not score particularly well in eitherdocumentation trait, suggesting general buyer dissatisfaction in this area.andM;&quot;WordPerfect has a reference manual that's uncontrollable,&quot; said Hughes'senior PC LAN consultant Crowder.andP;  &quot;It's overwhelming.andP;  It intimidatespeople.andP;  They have to find a way to get around that manual.&quot;andM;&quot;WordPerfect's documentation is toughest,&quot; agreed the microcomputer supportmanager, &quot;but it's clear,&quot; he maintained.andM;Tom Calhoun, systems analyst in the MIS department of the City of Charlotte,N.C., said that he doesn't expect much from product documentation.andP;  &quot;Withjust about anything, if it's a new product, you wait for books to come out onit in the bookstore.andP;  The manuals get you by until the real books come out inthe store.&quot;andM;Little Expected from Tech SupportandM;Although Texaco's Vachuda stressed that &quot;support should be up there aswell--vendors should keep the customer happy,&quot; both vendor-support traits didnot receive noteworthy scores from respondents.andM;The City of Charlotte's Calhoun explained, &quot;If I had a terrifc manual, Iwouldn't need tech support.andP;  If vendors worked harder on their documentation,their technical support wouldn't have to work as hard.&quot;andM;&quot;Technical support is less important than documentation,&quot; said Andrew Conte,manager of office systems for NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co.andO;&quot;Have you ever tried calling up vendor tech support?andP;  They always have to getback to you.andP;  Meanwhile your boss is breathing down your neck, and you can'tjust say you'll tell them the answer later.andM;&quot;It's always better to pick up the manuals quickly to get the answer.andP;  It's abig help,&quot; he said.andM;Distinguishing MarksandM;While the overall scores of many of the products were close, some notabledifferences among the products are apparent.andM;For instance, Ami Professional received a score in third-ranked ease of useof the user interface that was fully 10 points higher than the next-higherscore, and came in 14 points ahead of the score WordPerfect 5.1 drew from itsbuyers.andM;&quot;For novice users new to word processing, Ami Professional is a lotfriendlier than WordPerfect,&quot; said Fred Parlato, project manager at realestate management and investment firm Equitable Real Estate.andM;&quot;It has an intuitive graphical interface that invites you to explore[functions], whereas with WordPerfect you have to use several Shift/Controlfunction-key combinations.&quot;andM;Parlato did note that Ami's &quot;performance isn't anything to write home about,but the productivity increases [due to the Windows environment] and the lowerlearning curve of Windows applications outweighs any speed disadvantages&quot; incomparison to WordPerfect.andM;A particular hindrance in using WordPerfect is its &quot;non-standardinterface--the help key is F3 or something, not F1 like you'd expect,&quot; hesaid.andM;However, WordPerfect 5.1 outscored Ami Professional in the most crucialcategory of overall reliability as well as in the second-place category ofoverall performance by seven points in each.andM;&quot;Most of our machines are 286s, 12 MHz or less,&quot; said the microcomputersupport manager for the Fortune 100 firm.andP;  &quot;People doing text processing canmove faster with WordPerfect than with Ami Professional.andP;  They're notimporting pictures or anything,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;At first I was skeptical about WordPerfect--I don't like function keys--butit's got all the features that 95 percent of our people want,&quot; he said.andM;Finally, with the lowest scores in each of the 11 characteristics used bybuyers as a basis for scoring, DisplayWrite 4.0 placed lowest overall--ninepoints under its nearest competitor.andM;Largest Point SpreadsandM;Among the largest scoring gaps were a 14-point difference in support quality,a 13-point difference in ease of importing and exporting files and a 12-pointgap in support accessibility.andM;&quot;DisplayWrite 4.0 doesn't have a macro language, it doesn't have fontcapabilities and it doesn't have graphics capabilities,&quot; said Calhoun, theCity of Charlotte's systems analyst.andM;&quot;WordPerfect does a far better job converting documents from the AS/400 to aregular PC,&quot; he said, explaining that &quot;the only reason we have DisplayWritehere is that four years ago we had an IBM 5520 mainframe, and at that timeDisplayWrite was the only one that could translate documents from themainframe to PCs.andM;&quot;As far as calling IBM for tech support,&quot; Calhoun added, &quot;all I ever get isvoice mail, and the voice mailbox is full a lot.andP;  The phone support isterrible.andP;  I haven't tried the new number for DisplayWrite help though,&quot; headmitted.andM;&quot;DisplayWrite is the first word processor I ever learned,&quot; said Texaco'sanalyst, Vachuda.andP;  &quot;It could use an update.andP;  It could do more if it had agraphics interface.&quot;andM;&quot;DisplayWrite is fairly easy to use when you first sit down,&quot; said Calhoun.andO;&quot;In the beginning, WordPerfect is probably harder, but its learning curve isworth it.andP;  With DisplayWrite, you hit the wall sooner.andP;  However, a user canget a document done in DisplayWrite sooner than with WordPerfect.&quot;andM;In the area of overall reliability and data recovery, Hauth, the managementsystems engineer for West Valley Nuclear Services, pointed out that&quot;DisplayWrite offers a utilities option that you can use to recover a filethat's blown up, say, because of power spikes.andP;  We're out in the country andwe get a lot of power surges,&quot; she explained.andP;  &quot;DisplayWrite does have mathfunctions, but it's not really user-friendly,&quot; she concluded.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
