The authors already describedthe general recovery characteristics and its dependence on the preformand fiber properties. Here, they present their results on the effectsof the following test parameters on the recovery rates: bremsstrahlungdose, electron dose electron energy, light wavelength, light power andfiber temperature. Pure-silica-core optical fibers were irradiated withbrehmsstrahlung or electrons from a Febetron 705 and the recovery wasmeasured in the time regime 10/sup -6/ s to 10/sup 4/ s. The experimentallydetermined dependencies should be helpful in developing a consistenttheoretical understanding of the transient radiation effects in opticalfibers.</TEXT></DOC>
