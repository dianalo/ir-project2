In a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the court reinstated the claim ofthe son of a mentally retarded nursing home resident who was rapedby another patient.   Previously, California, New Jersey and Washington haverecognized a wrongful life suit in which a child claims that wereit not for the negligence of another, the child would never havebeen born.   Forum Group Inc., owner of Riverview Manor nursing home inMarion, is the defendant in the Indiana suit.   According to court records, a mentally retarded resident of thehome, Wayne Anthony Morgan, had intercourse with a retarded34-year-old woman, unable to speak or control her muscles, morethan once in the summer of 1985.   Morgan later pleaded guilty but mentally ill to a rape charge.   The woman gave birth to a son on March 25, 1986. Later, a suitwas filed against the nursing home on behalf of the woman, herparents and the son.   The suit, brought on behalf of the boy by his adoptive mother,claimed negligence allowed the child to be born ``into a world inwhich there is no natural parent capable of caring for andsupporting him.''   Other parts of the suit alleged Forum was negligent in notprotecting the mother from Morgan and in failing to provideprenatal care until discovering the pregnancy in its fifth month.   Forum didn't concede Morgan was the father and denied negligence.   Johnson Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey C. Eggers dismissed all ofthe claims except one pressed by the adoptive mother. That isawaiting trial.   But the Court of Appeals said the son's claim deserves a trial.Judge Linda Chezem wrote for the court:   ``We now recognize a wrongful life cause of action to include asituation where, as in (the boy's) case, both parents are soseverely mentally or physically impaired as to render themincapable of affirmatively deciding to have a child or to care fora child and where but for the custodian's negligent care of bothparents, the child would not have been conceived.''   The court majority said an Indiana law prohibiting certainwrongful life actions fails to apply in this case. That lawprevents a claim related to a decision on whether to abort apregnancy.   But, Chezem said, the boy's claim raises a separate issue ofwhether, without Forum's negligence, he would have been conceived.   Although the boy's claim sought financial support until hereaches age 21, the court said any support he receives as damagesshould be only for the period from his birth until his adoption.   In a concurring opinion, Judge William Conover said he would gofarther by allowing the child to recover damages for mental pain,suffering and anguish based on a diminished quality of life hemight suffer from being the child of two mentally deficient parents.   Conover said the child had ``a personal right not to be born''under such circumstances and thus his conception alone``constitutes the required trauma and injury, however slight,'' torecover damages.   Court of Appeals Chief Judge Wesley W. Ratliff Jr. disagreedwith the majority, arguing that the child's birth in itself shouldnot be considered an injury for which he can collect damages.   Ratliff said that although testimony indicated the child had a10 percent chance of developing a medical problem, there is noevidence the boy suffers from any defect or disability. Withoutthat proof, no injury and no liability exist, Ratliff said.</TEXT></DOC>
