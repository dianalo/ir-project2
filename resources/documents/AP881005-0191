Inc. will return $4.9 million incoupons and other benefits to consumers under a settlement in a1985 price-fixing case, it was announced Wednesday.   ``This settlement will return money to the wallets of shopperswho were deprived of the discounts they were entitled to in thefirst place,'' state Attorney General James Shannon said in astatement.   Sandy Bouzoukis, spokeswoman for Braintree-based Stop andamp; Shop,said the supermarket chain ``reached the settlement with theattorney general to avoid the further consumption of time and costof litigation'' without admitting liability or wrong-doing in thecase.   The attorney general sued Stop andamp; Shop, Waldbaum Inc. and FirstNational Supermarkets in 1985, charging them with conspiring toterminate double coupon offers between 1978 and 1982.   The charges against Waldbaum were resolved in a $2.6 millionsettlement in 1987. The case against First National is stillpending in federal court.   Under the settlement, Stop andamp; Shop will distribute $3 million incoupons to western Massachusetts households in January, Februaryand March.   Consumers will be able to redeem the $2 coupons when they makepurchases of $20 or more in western Massachusetts stores. Eachcoupon will be valid for 14 days.   In addition, the supermarket chain will issue 1.6 million $1coupons which will be redeemable on purchases of $10 or more ateastern Massachusetts stores. The distribution dates for thesecoupons will be announced later.   The coupons will be included in newspaper inserts and mailersdelivered to households and in advertising circulars available atStop andamp; Shop stores. Stop andamp; Shop operates 60 stores in the state.   ``I urge consumers to take full advantage of this settlement bycutting out the coupons and redeeming them,'' Shannon said.   Stop andamp; Shop also agreed to donate $100,000 in high-protein foodto the Western Massachusetts Food Bank and to reimburse the state$200,000 in litigation costs.</TEXT></DOC>
