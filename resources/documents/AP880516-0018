ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush was an 11th-hour choice by RonaldReagan in 1980. Lyndon Johnson was written off as a potentialrunning mate for John F. Kennedy in 1960. Spiro Agnew was unknownuntil Richard Nixon tapped him in 1968 and Bob Dole was at the topof nobody's list in 1976 _ except Gerald Ford's.   When it comes to picking running mates, history indicates thenominees may turn to someone the handicappers considered a longshot, or didn't consider at all.   The conventional wisdom has it that Democrat Michael Dukakiswould have to choose a Southerner as his vice presidential runningmate and Republican George Bush must choose a conservative as hissecond. But there are a dozen possible choices that fit neitherbill.   Here is a rundown of the names most often mentioned in bothparties, starting with the Democrats:   JESSE JACKSON _ He'll enter the Democratic convention in Julywith the second largest bloc of delegates and the allegiance ofmillions of black voters. Former President Jimmy Carter callsJackson ``amazingly attractive.'' But many party leaders considerJackson too controversial and likely to hurt the ticket. Partychairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. points out that only once since the turnof the century has a presidential nominee offered a place on theticket to his leading rival. ``If I were to finish second, itwouldn't entitle me to anything more than consideration. Period,''Dukakis said.   SAM NUNN _ A favorite of fellow Southerners, the Georgian ischairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and perceived bysupporters as blunting Republican criticism that the Democrats areanti-defense. Nunn's conservative voting record on domestic issuesand opposition to some civil rights legislation and the EqualRights Amendment generate opposition among liberals.   BOB GRAHAM _ A popular former governor of Florida, Graham is inhis first Senate term. His limited service in Congress worksagainst him if Dukakis is looking for someone to balance his ownlack of Washington experience. But if he brings 21 Southernelectoral votes, who needs Washington experience?   LLOYD BENTSEN _ With 29 electoral votes, Texas is an even biggerSouthern prize than Florida and one that has often been critical toDemocratic victories. ``I have no interest in it,'' says thesenator. More important is the question of whether Bentsen coulddeliver the state Bush most often calls home.   DALE BUMPERS _ The Arkansas senator is one of the party's bestspeakers and sounds unmistakably Southern even though his votingrecord makes him a favorite of liberals. Bumpers has 13 years ofexperience in Congress, but can he help Dukakis anywhere other thanArkansas, which has only six electoral votes?   ALBERT GORE JR. _ Gore, a Tennessee senator, carried primariesin four Southern states as well as his home state, proving hispopularity in the pivotal region, and he also holds acceptablecredentials in defense and foreign policy. But he took some nastyshots at Dukakis during the primary campaign.   JOHN GLENN _ A Glenn boomlet developed when anti-Nunn Democratslooked around for somebody with strong defense credentials but amore liberal record on domestic issues. Glenn, an Ohio senator,still is revered by many as the former Marine colonel who was thefirst American to orbit earth. On the down side is his disastrous1984 presidential campaign and the fact he comes from a state thatDukakis ought to be able to carry without him.   On the Republican side, Bush has the advantage of waiting untilDukakis makes his choice. Here are some of the GOP prospects:   GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN _ If he could give Bush a lock on California's47 electoral votes, the richest prize in the nation, Deukmejianwould be a tempting choice. But the governor and many of his fellowCalifornians are worried that he would be succeeded in Sacramentoby a Democrat if elected vice president.   JACK KEMP _ He was a conservative favorite in the race for thepresidential nomination, but failed to show an ability to getvotes. His biggest plus would be if Bush felt he needed to make agesture to the party's right wing. Kemp is a New York congressman,but Bush needs more than Buffalo to carry the state.   LAMAR ALEXANDER _ The former Tennessee governor won praise forinnovative programs that improved Tennessee's schools during histwo terms as governor. Bush is known to consult Alexander oneducation issues. He has the ability to appeal to both moderatesand conservatives.   BOB DOLE _ An unlikely choice after a campaign in which herepeatedly belittled Bush's credentials. But the Kansas senator isstrongest where Bush is weakest _ in the Farm Belt. Bush choosingDole would be on a par with Kennedy choosing Johnson.   ELIZABETH DOLE _ A far more likely choice than her husband. Anappealing campaigner from North Carolina, she helps Bush amongwomen voters, a group where pollsters say he is weakest. Mrs. Dole,the former transportation secretary, also is a favorite of Sen.Jesse Helms of North Carolina, which scores a lot of points withconservatives. Detractors blame her for chaos in the airlineindustry. Her husband could prove another negative.   JAMES THOMPSON _ As governor of Illinois, Thompson has big-statecredentials. But during 12 years as governor, he has made enoughenemies that polls suggest he might not be able to deliver hisstate.   THE WESTERNERS _ Colorado Sen. William Armstrong, former NevadaSen. Paul Laxalt, and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel. Long shotsall. Not a big batch of electoral votes among them and if Bushneeds them to carry their states, he's probably not going to becomepresident.   THE MODERATES _ White House chief of staff Howard Baker, NewJersey Gov. Thomas Kean and Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum are out ofstep with the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan. One of the mostpopular politicians in the history of New Jersey, Kean wouldprobably trigger a conservative revolt if put on the ticket.Conservatives still resent Baker for his role in passage of thePanama Canal treaty. Kassebaum's voting record is one of the mostliberal of any Republican in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
