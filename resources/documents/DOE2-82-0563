<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0563 </DOCNO><TEXT>Design rules and procedures for high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor componentsare being formulated as an ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Case.A draft of the Case, patterned after Code Case N-47, and limited to Inconel617 and temperatures of 982{degree}C (1800{degree}F) or less, will becompleted in 1989 for consideration by relevant Code committees. Thepurpose of this paper is to provide a synopsis of the significant differencesbetween the draft Case and N-47, and to provide more complete accountsof the development of allowable stress and stress rupture values andthe development of isochronous stress vs strain curves, in both of whichOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) played a principal role. The isochronouscurves, which represent average behavior for many heats of Inconel 617,were based in part on a unified constitutive model developed at ORNL.Details are also provided of this model of inelastic deformation behavior,which does not distinguish between rate-dependent plasticity and time-dependentcreep, along with comparisons between calculated and observed resultsof tests conducted on a typical heat of Inconel 617 by the General ElectricCompany for the Department of Energy. 4 refs., 15 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
