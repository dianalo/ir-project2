Capital Markets Assurance Corp., a Citicorp unit, provided a limited guarantee on the Chemical Banking Corp. unit's offering, enabling the securities to carry a triple-A rating from Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The boat-loan issue is backed by a pool of loans on motorboats and sailboats in Chemical Bank's portfolio.    The three-year-old asset-backed market continues to expand at a considerable rate, led recently by a surge in credit-card securitization. There are more than $20 billion of asset-backed securities outstanding, with auto loans and credit cards dominating the market.    Issuers of asset-backed securities often pay outside companies to provide full or partial guarantees, which typically result in triple-A ratings, enabling the offerings to be sold at lower interest rates.    Without outside credit support, it is difficult for issuers to get top-grade ratings, which are important to credit-conscious asset-backed securities investors.    The use of the outside guarantee also allows issuers to treat the securities offering as asset sales, freeing equity capital that had been used to support the assets. This factor is important for banks, which are under pressure to bolster their capital positions by either raising new equity or freeing up equity through asset sales.    With $200 million of capital provided by Citicorp, Capital Markets Assurance will be able to issue guarantees on a substantial amount of securities offerings given the leverage possible in the business. Leverage can run as high as 100 to 1, meaning $20 billion of securities offerings could be supported by $200 million of capital, says Mary O'Gorman, senior vice president at Capital Markets Assurance.    The Citicorp unit also aims to guarantee other types of securities issues, including commercial paper backed by securitized assets, and home and commercial mortgage offerings.    The company is rated triple-A by Sandamp;P based on its capital base and its underwriting standards. Its rating is above Citicorp's senior debt rating of double-A. </TEXT></DOC>
