An express train from Poole, 90 miles southwest of London,rammed into the back of another passenger train near south London'sClapham Junction rail station on Dec. 12, 1988.

Four commuters who regularly ride the express train to London'sWaterloo Station gathered in the buffet car this morning for achampagne toast to their friends who died.   ``We are toasting missing colleagues who were with us in thebuffet and who would have preferred it this way, instead of beingsomber about it,'' said Christopher Reeves, 39, an engineer whoneeded seven stitches in a head wound after the crash.   British Rail and a government-appointed inquiry blamed carelesssignaling work and overworked employees for the malfunctioningdirection lights which caused the accident.
