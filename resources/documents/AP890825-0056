Pierce Jr. in an interview published todaystrongly rejected allegations that his department gave high-poweredRepublicans preferential treatment.   ``Everybody was treated the same,'' he told the Los Angeles Timesin his first published interview in three months. ``That was theadvice and the word that I gave to the people at HUD.''   Pierce also said his efforts to help former law partners did notbreach his pledge to sever ties to the firm because he received nofinancial benefit from the favors and had no agreement to return tothe firm.   Pierce, who was in the Cabinet throughout the Reaganadministration, had not commented publicly about the HUD influencepeddling furor since he testified before Congress May 25. He isscheduled to testify again Sept. 15 and said he is looking forwardto ``setting the record straight.''   Pierce, in the interview, would not discuss some subjects, citinghis upcoming testimony and a deal with a magazine he did notidentify to publish his complete story next month.   He would not discuss why he ordered HUD in 1985 to fund a Durham,N.C., housing project that was opposed by many staff members butsupported by the Republican mayor of Durham. The mayor was a formerlaw colleague of Pierce's and a former Reagan campaign strategist.   ``I had what I think, anyway, were good reasons, but I will haveto save that for the subcommittee,'' he said.   Pierce insisted funding for projects was based on merits. He saidhe believes some members of Congress whom he would not identify areattacking him because these lawmakers' traditional role in lobbyingfor HUD grants was taken over in part by consultants.   Developers have testified that they paid large amounts of moneyto consultants because they thought doing so was essential towinning HUD action in the Pierce years.   ``Some of these congressmen, they are saying, `Nobody can get youthis but us. This is our job, and we don't want any competition,'''said Pierce.   Pierce asserted that he was a hands-on manager, but acknowledgedhe did not know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised byhis former executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean.   In his May testimony, Pierce said that he was not a hands-onmanager and that he was not involved in recommending funding forspecific projects. But later testimony by other former officialsshowed that Pierce was directly involved in some projects.   ``Of course, I was involved in making decisions andrecommendations,'' he said. ``You can't be in a job for eight yearsand not make a decision.''   The congressional inquiry was sparked by allegations that HUD'smoderate rehabilitation program to repair rental housing for thepoor and elderly was beset by favoritism. Testimony has disclosedthat Ms. Dean, rather than a committee, made many of the decisionabout which projects were funded.   ``I didn't find out until the hearings that it was working thatway,'' Pierce said. ``I had a damn good right to think that it wasworking right.''   Ms. Dean has refused to testify and has asserted through herattorneys that HUD funding decisions were made by Pierce.</TEXT></DOC>
