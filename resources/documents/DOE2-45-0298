With the T/sub 2/ weighted spin echo image (T/sub 2/-W-SE),the center portion of normal discs showed high signal intensity, withgradual drop-off of signal intensity toward the edges. Experiments usinggelatine indicated that this change in signal intensity resulted fromthe change in water content of the disc. In contrast to discograms, theuse of MRI allowed disc degeneration to be classified into the threelevels of ''normal'', ''mild degeneration'' and ''moderate or severedegeneration''. MRI allowed excellent depiction of disc herniation, evenwhere a myelogram showed a complete block, and it also readily distinguishedrecurrent disc herniation and post-operative scarring.</TEXT></DOC>
