Under this strategy, begun during the Reagan era butexpanded massively by Mr. Thornburgh, the feds have vowed tochase obscene-video peddlers, street-corner drug dealers,housing project stick-up men and, most recently, any feloncarrying a gun.</LP><TEXT>   As a political weapon, &quot;federalizing&quot; local crime hasblown away congressional Democrats. But trenchant objectionsto the Thornburgh program have come from academic copwatchers and, surprisingly, from some conservativeconstitutional purists as well.   Consider &quot;Project Triggerlock,&quot; Mr. Thornburgh's campaignto punish gun-carrying felons under tougher federal laws,rather than state statutes. The attorney general offers it asan answer to public fears about violence and drugs,especially in such states as Florida, where local authoritiesare overwhelmed.   Mr. Thornburgh, who plans to resign this summer to run forthe Senate from Pennsylvania, has generally befuddledcongressional Democrats with Triggerlock and similarinitiatives. Fearful of looking soft on crime, Democrats haveresorted to trying to outbid the administration on how manynew federal agents should be dispatched to the hinterlands.   Still, some skeptics see potential dangers in addressinglocal crime problems by promising to send in the FederalBureau of Investigation or the Drug EnforcementAdministration. One threat is that symbolism will replacesubstance. The New York City police force alone outnumbersthe FBI's 10,500 agents; even with recent increases, the fedscan't really walk the local beat for any sustained period.   &quot;Without a connection to a broader local effort,&quot; warnsRichard Powers, a historian of federal law enforcement, &quot;FBIinvolvement is usually pointless&quot;; the same goes for the DEAor any other federal enforcement agency. Worse, adds Mr.Powers, who teaches at the City University of New York, &quot;theFBI can be used by (national) politicians as a deflection ofa serious social problem.&quot;   As recently as last year, for example, lawmakers wereshouting for the FBI to &quot;put the Sandamp;L crooks in jail&quot; -- as ifthat would solve the crisis in the thrift industry. Many Sandamp;Lswindlers have been prosecuted. But the clamoring on CapitolHill to lock-'em-up distracted public attention from thegreed, lax regulation and complicated economic conditionsthat contributed more to the Sandamp;L mess than did criminalfraud.   The aim of the flashy-sounding Project Triggerlock is tosubject gun-toting hoods to stiff federal mandatory minimumsanctions. Under these laws, &quot;career criminals&quot; caughtcarrying a pistol face at least a mandatory 15-year federalprison sentence. The Justice Department says it's too earlyto tell how well Triggerlock is working. But individualfederal prosecutors boast of significant accomplishments.   In Tampa, Fla., U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman proudlyreports that federal agents have &quot;taken down dozens anddozens of armed career criminals&quot; over the past two years inan effort that was the model for Project Triggerlock.Pointing to studies that have found that less than 10% of thecriminal population commits 70% of all offenses, Mr. Genzmansays, &quot;We're trying to take out the ones who can't bedeterred and need to be incapacitated.&quot;   Explaining a similar effort to target violent neighborhoodgangs in Philadelphia, Michael Baylson, the U.S. attorney inthat troubled city, contends: &quot;These groups have floutedstate drug laws for so long that federal resources werenecessary to drive them out.&quot;   Brandishing the Constitution, however, Bruce Fein, aconservative legal analyst here, asserts that Triggerlock andrelated efforts violate basic principles of federalism. &quot;Whyshould the federal government be deciding how many years acriminal gets when it's the local community that's affected?&quot;he asks. If states want longer prison sentences, statelawmakers can pass them.   Republicans, including Mr. Thornburgh, sometimes invokefederalism to defend states' rights and oppose congressionalregulation. But when it comes to crime, conservatives &quot;thinkthey can get political brownie points by overriding state andlocal authorities,&quot; asserts Mr. Fein, who was a JusticeDepartment official and general counsel of the FederalCommunications Commission during the Reagan administration.   All prosecutors have tremendous discretion to decide whichsuspected bad guys to round up. When the problem is armedconvenience-store thieves or crack salesmen, says Mr. Fein,&quot;State choices should not be overruled by federal fiat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
