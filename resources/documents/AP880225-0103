(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pentecostal leaders gathered today todeliberate the fate of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart after anadmitted prostitute said she performed pornographic acts for himfor about a year.   The woman's account, in a New Orleans television interviewWednesday, added to pressures besetting the Executive Presbytery ofthe Assemblies of God, at its international headquarters here.   The nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, which gets $12million a year from Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries in Baton Rouge,La., reported being swamped with up to 300 calls an hour since theevangelist confessed last Sunday to unspecified sexual misconduct.   About half of the callers complained that the denomination'sLouisiana council's recommendation that Swaggart be suspended frompreaching for three months and receive counseling was too lenient,said Juleen Turnage, Assemblies' secretary of information.   ``A lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation,''said the Rev. Richard Champion, editor of the denomination'sweekly, Pentecostal Evangel. ``Many thought it too light. Somethought it too severe.''   Mrs. Turnage said public sentiment would not be a factor for 12presbyters who planned to convene this afternoon in a closedsession to discuss Swaggart's punishment.   The church's final verdict will be in accord with ``theseriousness of the offense,'' Mrs. Turnage said.   An unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexualoffenses are barred from preaching for at least a year. ``It'snever been less than a year,'' she said.   Church sources raised the possibility that the presbytery couldinstruct the Louisiana district council to reconsider itsrecommendations on grounds that members of Swaggart's boardimproperly participated and the results were announced prematurely.   ``It created tremendous pressures, appearing that the Louisianadistrict was trying to dictate its judgment,'' said the Rev. HowardCummings of Aurora, Colo., a former district presbyter.   Swaggart, whose ministry brought in $142 million in 1986, is thedenomination's most prominent evangelist with fire-and-brimstonebroadcasts in more than 100 countries. He has been known for hisharsh denunciations of sexual lapses by other preachers, includingPTL founder Jim Bakker.   Evangelist Marvin Gorman has a $90 million lawsuit pendingagainst Swaggart, claiming Swaggart falsely accused him of numerousacts of adultery. Gorman reportedly gave the denominationphotographs of Swaggart entering and leaving a motel room with aprostitute.   A woman who gave her name as Debra Murphree told WVUE-TV of NewOrleans that she had met with Swaggart for about a year at variousmotels to perform pornographic acts.   ``To me, I think he's kind of perverted or, you know, talkingabout some of the things that we talked about in the rooms, youknow, I wouldn't want him around my children,'' Murphree told areporter who traced her to a motel in West Palm Beach, Fla., onWednesday.   The station did not say how the reporter tracked the woman down,but said it did not pay for the interview.   The station quoted her as saying she was the woman with Swaggartwhen he was photographed last October, and that she did not havesexual intercourse with Swaggart.   ``He wanted me to get naked and maybe lay on the bed and posefor him,'' she said.   ``He asked me if he could take me home and get dressed up in adress or something, you know, no underwear and ride around you knowand just, maybe in the evening, and take my clothes off and maybeget out of the car and just get back in and, you know, it sort ofturned him on.''   The Jefferson Parish sheriff, in New Orleans' western suburbs,said Wednesday that Murphree had been arrested for soliciting forprostitution. Police in Tampa, Fla., similarly reported thatMurphree had been arrested in 1985 and 1986 for loitering forprostitution and soliciting for exposure.   Tampa police said Murphree also was known to them as DeborahArlene Hedge, 28, a native of Princeton, Ind.   Murphree said her trysts with Swaggart occurred in motels onAirline Highway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. She saidSwaggart would pick her up once or twice a month in histelephone-equipped Lincoln Town Car.   She said Swaggart never discussed God or religion with her.   The Washington Post reported today that witnesses said Swaggartwore hats, sunglasses and headbands, or combed his hair down infront to help disguise himself.   Murphree said she was sure her companion was Swaggart eventhough he did not use his name:   ``Oh, I knew who he was.''</TEXT></DOC>
