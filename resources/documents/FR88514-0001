Mr. President, Vice President <T4>Bush</T4> has made the overriding economic issues in the Presidentialcampaign very clear. The Bush argument is that 8 years of the Reagan economicprogram has brought an improving life for most Americans. Vice President<T4>Bush</T4> is appealing for election on the grounds that he will continuewhat he regards as these ``productive policies.'' <T4>Bush</T4> says he will bring 4 more years of a growing economy withmore jobs, rising national income, moderate inflation, and relatively stableinterest rates. And he will do it by providing fully for a strong nationaldefense, including full funding of star wars, more for scientific researchand for education, but, as he puts it, ``with no tax increase, period.''In the judgment of this Senator, Vice President <T4>Bush</T4> is absolutely wrong.Why is the Vice President wrong? Certainly the latest economic developmentsseem to be with him. Unemployment has just reached a 14-year low. American jobs continue to increase at a 1 million or more a year pace. The inflationexplosion of the seventies and early eighties has faded. Interest rates,too, are still below their level of a few years ago. So what's wrong? What'swrong is that the economic growth the Vice President refers to is the resultof a policy of an America that is living far beyond its means. In the 6years of this longest American peacetime economic recovery in this century,the Federal Government has pushed its expenditures so far ahead of itsrevenues that the Government has run the longest continuous series of megadeficits in history. So why the economic boom? The Government fiscal policiesproduced it. But there is a price. These fiscal policies have also buriedour Government under the largest national debt in the history of the world.They have also forced an increase in interest that has already reachedan obscene $150 billion per year on the publicly held portion of the explodingnational debt.Yes, indeed, Americans now enjoy a higher personal income. Yes, there aremore jobs. Yes, unemployment is lower. Yes, interest rates have remainedfairly stable. Overall Americans have, indeed, enjoyed 6 prosperous years.The American people haven't yet even begun to pay the price of these Reaganyears. But they will. Only an idiot can believe with <T4>George Bush</T4> that we can carry on the Reagan policies for another4 years without burying the American people under a<ITAG tagnum="80">mountain of debt and an interest burden on that debt that will swiftlybecome the biggest cost of our Government. We all know we can't eat excessivelyday after day and year after year without getting fat. We also know wecan't spend more than we earn and live year after year on more and moreborrowed money without going bankrupt. So what happens if under a BushPresidency the Reagan fiscal policies continue? The Vice President is tellingus that a Bush administration would continue to spend more and more, holddown taxes, and borrow more and more to make up the difference. In otherwords, more of the same. </ITAG>That's only part of what a Bush regime would count on to keep prosperitymoving ahead. In these Reagan years, the Federal Government has not beenalone in living beyond its means. American households have done the same.Since 1981, American families have increased their debt by a resounding87 percent. Now, it's true that the gross national product and inflationhave both grown rapidly. But household debt has increased 27 percent fasterthan the GNP during that period. Household debt is a resounding $3 trillion,far larger than the Federal Government debt, and an even clearer evidenceof the fact that this country is living beyond its means and accumulatinga debt that will impose a cruel interest burden for decades to come.It's worse. American business debt has exploded to the highest debt levelof all. Since 1981, this country's business debt has soared by 83 percent,24 percent faster than our GNP during the same period and has reached theappalling level of more than $4 trillion. Again the interest burden onAmerican business in coming years will be an immense burden. Here is acost that will prevent many firms from engaging in necessary research orupgrading the skills of their employees or buying more efficient equipment.It will, of course, make American business far more vulnerable to recession.Ever heavier debt and thinner equity is an increasingly more common corporateposture in our country. Here's a sure formula for the big American collapsecome the next recession.The 1988 election will become a referendum on this national debt policy.If the Vice President wins and gives us 4 more years of this Reagan economicpolicy, our national debt will once again double or triple. Household debtand business debt will climb by trillions. And the big cost, by far, atevery level_government, family, business_will be interest to pay for pastdebt. This will be a cost we cannot reduce. We cannot postpone, we cannotstretch out. We will have to pay it in full. We will have to pay it ontime.Isn't this gloom and doom? You bet it is. Nothing but. It's also starkrealism. It's the truth. The answer is to cut spending at all levels. Itis to raise taxes. It is to tell our families and businesses to save more,much more, and spend less, much less. Won't this bitter medicine causeeconomic pain? Won't it slow down the economy? Isn't it likely to increaseunemployment in the short run? Of course, it is. But the sooner we takethis medicine, the sooner we can save the greatest economy in history.[S13MY8-11]{S5684}F <ITAG tagnum="66">F </ITAG>[S13MY8-12]{S5684}RESERVATIO<ITAG tagnum="81">RESERVATION OF LEADERS' TIME </ITAG>[S13MY8-13]{S5684}PROXMIREMr. PROXMIRE.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S13MY8-19]{S5684}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, what is the pending business? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending business is S. 2355. [S13MY8-20]{S5684}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, we made substantial progress last night, as Iinformed all Members. We had the staff here over in the Armed ServicesCommittee, both Republican and Democratic staff, until 11 o'clock. Someworked much longer than that on a couple compromises. We had one team onthe drug proposals working until 3 or 4 o'clock this morning. So the staff has put in a very, very hard week and an extremely difficultnight, and Senators have put in long hours this week also. We have 93 amendments that are on the list. We have worked out over thecourse of the evening, we believe, about 30 of those amendments and thatincludes those that we feel are likely to be worked out which means thatthose 30 amendments will probably take not longer than about 5 minutesapiece on average. That gives us a couple hours just getting those amendments finished duringthe course of the day. In addition to that, we have approximately 12 amendments that we thinkare major amendments if they are offered in the sense that they will takea good bit of debate. In addition to those 12, and I hope a number of thosewill not be offered because if they are, we have a very, very long dayand night and probably even later, we have another 14 that if they areoffered we believe will require rollcall votes. I do not think the debateon those will be as long as the 12 but if they are offered, and again Ihope many of them will not be, they will require rollcall votes and, ofcourse, everybody can add up the amount of time on that.So it is going to be my hope today, and I will discuss this with the leaderlater on today and certainly the Senator from Virginia and I will deliberateon it, that we can seek a unanimous-consent request sometime either shortlyafter the first rollcall or before we get started on the Kennedy-Kerryamendment.In fact, I would like to seek the unanimous-consent early this morningso every Senator will at least be on alert to what we are seeking todayand even if we do not achieve the unanimous-consent at the first requestwe would at least begin the discussion. I know a lot of Members want to try to get away from here in the middleof the afternoon. That is understandable. People have a long way to go.Many people have engagements tonight. But I want to make clear everybody has known all week long that we weregoing to be in if necessary late on Friday night. So as the thing appears now unless we get a unanimous-consent agreementwhich would permit us to begin to vote on the final amendments and therebyvote on final passage somewhere around 4 o'clock, unless we are able toget that unanimous-consent agreement, then we are going to be in very latethis evening and perhaps into the wee hours tomorrow morning. If we do get that unanimous-consent agreement where we can have final passageby 4 o'clock, and that means under the rules we would take every amendmentand vote on it if someone wants a vote beginning at 4 o'clock, unless weget that kind of agreement, then every Member should be alerted that theyshould not make any plans for this evening unless they want to miss rollcallvotes because we are likely to have a number of rollcall votes today, tonight,and early into the hours of the morning.I hope that we can finish this bill today. But we are going to stay hereas long as necessary to see if we can finish it. If we cannot, we cannot.I know the Senator from Virginia has worked long and hard. I want to thankhim and his staff because we have had splendid cooperation from the Republicanside of the aisle, led by Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>and I would ask Senator <T4>Warner </T4>at this time if he has any comments.But first let me just say that we have about 30 amendments that betweennow and 9:30 we can take a whole lot of those amendments. We are hopingwe would have the Bingaman amendment on the Under Secretary for Procurement;the Adams-Evans amendment on Hanford waste cleanup; the Dixon amendmenton 155 base burn; the Gramm amendment on Presidential certification ofSaudi missiles; the McCain amendment on burden sharing; the Metzenbaumamendment on cleanup and disposition; the Murkowski amendment on the Philippines;the Quayle amendment on proliferation; the Warner amendment on printingand binding services; the Warner amendment on GPS adjustment; and the Shelbyamendment on Army Reserve Center. That is about 11 amendments that we can do in the next 45 minutes if wecan get Members over here. I will yield to Senator <T4>Warner.</T4> [S13MY8-21]{S5684}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the chairman in urging Members to cometo the floor and proceed with these amendments.I indeed express appreciation to the chairman for his statement with respectto the cooperation on both sides of the aisle. Indeed it has been a mostcooperative effort as it always is in the Armed Services Committee of theSenate. We work along on basically nonpartisan lines in the cause of nationaldefense under the leadership of our chairman.Momentarily, I will have the papers for the two small amendments that Ihave on the bottom of the list and I hope others will come shortly.Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate, in its consideration of the fiscalyear 1988 and 1989 authorizations last year, funded the Army Reserve requestfor $1.547 million for a reserve center in Gordo, AL, for fiscal year 1989.However, when the amended fiscal year 1989 authorization request came toCongress this year, this project was deleted.It is my understanding that this project is 95 percent design complete.I believe that we can achieve a cost savings by authorizing this projectagain this year as originally requested.I urge my colleagues to authorize $1.547 million for an Army Reserve Centerbuilding at the Army Reserve Center in Gordo, AL. The payment will be madefrom amounts in the Army Reserve account.Mr. President, I have discussed this with the subcommittee chairman andthe chairman of the committee and the ranking minority member.I do not believe there is any objection to this. I ask that the amendmentbe adopted.[S13MY8-31]{S5685}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to offerthis amendment to the National Defense authorization bill for fiscal year1989, which would authorize $1.547 million for the construction of a 60-memberArmy Reserve Center in Gordo, AL, fulfilling a needed and necessary requirementfor the U.S. Army Reserves. I do this along with my friend and colleaguefrom my home State of Alabama. This amendment would correct, what I believeto be, a mistake in the Defense Department's fiscal year 1989 amended budgetrequest. I am pleased that the Armed Services Committee has agreed to acceptthe amendment.Last year, when the President requested his 2-year budget for the Departmentof Defense, this Army Reserve Center for Gordo, AL, was included in therequest in recognition of its importance to the Army Reserves. However,when the President sent the amended budget request for the Defense Departmentto the Congress, the Army Reserve Center for Gordo was not included inthat request. As I have said, this Reserve Center fulfills a needed andnecessary function for the Army Reserves.I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator<T4>Dixon,</T4> the chairman of the Readiness, Sustainability and SupportSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over military construction for theArmed Services Committee, and the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire,Senator <T4>Humphrey,</T4> the ranking member of the subcommittee, for agreeingto the amendment. Also, I would like to thank the distinguished Senatorfrom Georgia, Senator <T4>Nunn,</T4> the chairman of the full Armed Services Committee, and thedistinguished Senator from Virginia, Senator <T4>Warner,</T4> the ranking member of the full committee.Once again, Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to offerthis amendment, along with my colleague from Alabama, Senator <T4>Shelby,</T4> which is so important to the Army Reserves and the townof Gordo, AL.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendmentwas agreed to.[S13MY8-34]{S5685}WARNERMr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.(Mr. SHELBY assumed the chair.)[S13MY8-35]{S5685}limits on <ITAG tagnum="89">limits on strategic offensive forces</ITAG>[S13MY8-36]{S5685}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, yesterday, I indicated that I would be offeringan amendment pertaining to a limit on strategic offensive forces. I hadplanned to do so because of the confusing events which took place on Wednesdaywith regard to the amendment offered by Senator <T4>Bumpers</T4> and others.Before I discuss what occurred during consideration of the Bumpers amendmentof Wednesday, let me remind my colleagues that I am among the several Membersof this body who have long been involved in the effort to maintain a mutualinterim restraint framework between the United States and the Soviet Union.In June 1986, Senator <T4>Biden</T4> and I offered the original legislation to require the Reaganadministration to abide by the central numerical sublimits of the unratifiedSALT II Treaty. I remain committed to ensuring, through binding legislation,that a mutual interim restraint regime be continued, so long as the SovietUnion shows restraints equal to that demonstrated by the United States.Mr. President, up until very shortly before the Senate vote on the Bumpersamendment on Wednesday, it was my understanding that the Bumpers amendmentwould have extended for 1 year the agreement on strategic force levelsreached in the fiscal year 1988 defense authorization conference. Thatconference agreement has had the effect of stabilizing, during fiscal year1988, U.S. MIRV'd strategic systems at roughly the level that existed atthe end of 1987. Accordingly, it had been my intent to support the Bumpersamendment.Shortly before Wednesday's vote, however, the floor colloquy revealed thatthe amendment's effect would, in fact, be quite different from last year'sconference agreement. Instead, the amendment would have had the effectof imposing upon the United States a limit on MIRV'd ICBM's significantlybelow the level deployed by the Soviet Union. Specifically, under the amendmentproposed on Wednesday, the United States would have been allowed no morethan 550 MIRV'd ICBM's as compared to the 820 MIRV'd ICBM's deployed bythe Soviet Union.Mr. President, I do not suggest that the United States should possess exactlythe same number of each type of strategic weapon as the Soviet Union. TheUnited States has a balanced force structure, relying far more on submarine-launchedballistic missiles and airbreathing weapons than does the Soviet Union.I support this balanced triad for U.S. forces. Accordingly, the <ITAG tagnum="80">mere fact that the United States has fewer weapons of a particulartype than the Soviet Union is not necessarily of concern.</ITAG>However, Mr. President, the United States has a policy that we should nothave limits imposed upon our strategic forces inferior to the limits providedfor the Soviet Union. The amendment considered on Wednesday was inconsistentwith this policy in that it placed unequal limits on the two nations' forces.I would also note that the amendment considered on Wednesday differed inthis same respect from the binding interim restraint legislation offeredin the past both by myself and by Senator <T4>Bumpers,</T4> which imposed equal limits on the two sides' strategicforces.This was the reason, Mr. President, that I felt it necessary to opposethe amendment offered by Senator <T4>Bumpers</T4> on Wednesday.In no way did this indicate a change in my position on this issue. I remaincommitted to ensuring that a mutual interim restraint regime between theUnited States and the Soviet Union is maintained until a START Treaty,can be put in place.This effort to preseve a predictable strategic environment pending a STARTTreaty advanced significantly last year when both the Senate and the Houseof Representatives approved amendments to the defense authorization actrequiring that the United States adhere to the SALT II central numericalsublimits, so long as the Soviet Union did the same. The central numericalsublimits are the ceilings of 820 on launchers of intercontinental ballisticmissiles equipped with multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles_thatis, MIV'd ICBM's_1,200 on the combined number of launchers of MIRV'd ICBM'sand MIRV'd submarine-launched ballistic missiles [SLBM's]; and 1,320 onthe combined number of MIRV'd ICBM's, MIRV'd SLBM's, and heavy bombersequipped for air-launched cruise missiles [ACLM's].During the conference on the Defense Authorization Act, an agreement wasreached among the conferees and with the concurrence of the administrationthat dropped both the Senate and House interim restraint amendments butadded bill language requiring the retirement of the <T3>Andrew Jackson</T3>, a Poseidon submarine. The reason cited in thestatement of managers for this requirement was severe budgetary constraints.At the same time, the statement of managers stated:[S13MY8-37]{S5686}<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the conferees note that decisions taken for budgetary reasonse* * * will have the effect of stabilizing U.S. strategic forces duringfiscal year 1988 at roughly the level deployed as of the date of enactmentof the bill.</ITAG>The statement of managers went on to set forth a policy with regard tointerim restraint:[S13MY8-38]{S5686}<ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees believe that maintaining interim restraint in strategicoffensive force levels is not only prudent in light of current budget realities,but also consistent with the reccent progress in the START negotiationsand the continuing Soviet practice of retiring older ICBMs and SLBMs priorto the end of their normal service life. Assuming that progress continuesto be made in START and that the Soviet Union continues early retirementsof ICBMs and SLBMs, it would be the intent of the conferees to take suchactions as may be required to maintain U.S. and Soviet interim restraint,including the option of foregoing the overhaul of additional Poseidon-classsubmarines nearing the end of their normal service life. If, however, theSoviet Union should increase the threat to U.S. national security interestsposed by its strategic offensive arms, the conferees would reconsider theadvisability of maintaining a stable level of U.S. strategic launchersand would entertain requests by the administration to respond appropriatelyin reporgramming actions, supplemental budget requests, or the fiscal year1989 defense budget request.</ITAG>While this compromise was less explicit than the amendments approved bythe Senate and the House, it represented a reversal of the administration'sposition on this critical issue. In essence, the administration capitulatedto the Congress in exchange for the limitation on strategic forces beingmade implicit.In my view, this outcome was acceptable and can serve as the basis formaintaining a mutual interim restraint regime during fiscal year 1989.Senator <T4>Bumpers </T4>will very shortly offer an amendment which is essentiallyidentical to the one adopted by the Senate last year. I am joining himas a cosponsor of that amendment. This would put us in the same conference situation as last year, sincethe House has approved last month a nearly identical binding interim restraintamendment to its defense authorization bill. Accordingly, we would be assuredof a conference outcome containing a binding interim restraint measure.In conference, of course, the conferees could choose to change this amendment'sexplicit limitation on strategic forces into an implicit limitation similarto last year's, out of deference to the administration's strong views onthis matter. [S13MY8-39]{S5686}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield? [S13MY8-40]{S5686}COHENMr. COHEN. Yes, I yield. [S13MY8-41]{S5686}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would say, in response to the Senator's excellentstatement in explanation of where we are now, I agree with him. I am infavor of that interim restraint also. I voted against the Bumpers-Leahyamendment this week. I did not think it was properly drawn. Although Ithink it was an attempt to basically duplicate what we did last year, itreally did not do that and the level on the land-based missiles was belownot only the SALT II level but also below the present Soviet level. So, practically speaking, it would not have made a great deal of difference.Symbolically, it has been important in the past and continues to be. So I will assure the Senator that I will work very closely with him. Hewill be on the conference as one of our key members. I will work very closelywith him in coming out of that conference with provisions that take intoaccount, of course, the House provision, take into account the Senate debate,and take into account a need for a continued interim restraint, thoughnot a formal restraint since we certainly do not have a formal treaty thathas been ratified. [S13MY8-42]{S5686}COHENMr. COHEN. I thank the Senator for his comments.It is my understanding that Senator <T4>Bumpers </T4>will at some point today offer an amendment similar tothat of last year that would impose the binding restraints that were identicalto last year's.As the Senator from Georgia will recall, in conference the administrationwas vehemently opposed to any reference to SALT II. As a result of theconference work, which the Senator from Georgia was instrumental in producing,we dropped the specific explicit prohibition and yet had a commitment toretire the Poseidon submarine that kept us under the limit. So the administration'sobjections were met, while the objectives on the part of the Senate andHouse were met. I hope we might achieve a similar result in the event thatSenator <T4>Bumpers </T4>does offer his amendment, even though it may be explicit,in terms of its binding specific sublimits, that during the conferencewith the House, we would arrive essentially where we did last year andsimply continue for 1 year the same interim restraint we showed this pastyear.[S13MY8-43]{S5686}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator that if he does havea conversation with Senator <T4>Bumpers </T4>and Senator <T4>Leahy</T4>_and I certainly will say the same thing to them_I wouldhope if they bring that up they will debate it a little while but not askfor a rollcall vote. Because we have already dealt with it and I thinkMembers are going to be rather weary of dealing with that subject. I thinkthey are going to get less votes than they would have gotten perhaps lastyear and I believe that we will be much better off in conference, sincethe House has that in that bill and since there are a number of confereeswho feel just as the Senator from Maine and I do, that we will be ableto deal with it better in a better atmosphere if we do not have anothervote on SALT II on this bill.The reason I say that is the White House has not been very involved inthat matter this week. They have had other things on their minds. But ifwe have a big debate on it today, I think it is going to harden positionsaround town. There is so much symbolism here and there are so few peoplewho are in the practical, realistic, commonsense camp that the Senatorfrom Maine is in that I would hope that we would just let the thing liewhere it is, understand that we are going to work it out in conference,and understand that a big debate on the floor of the Senate today is notgoing to make much difference in the outcome of it and will largely besymbolic.So everthing has gotten into the symbolic stage here and what we reallyneed is some pragmatism and common sense as to how to maintain an interimrestraint without getting into all the emotionalism of the past history.The Senator from Maine has been a leader in that pragmatic approach andI commend him for that and I will work with him in conference.[S13MY8-44]{S5687}COHENMr. COHEN. Which is not to suggest the Senator from Arkansas has not beena pragmatist at times.[S13MY8-45]{S5687}NUNNMr. NUNN. No. I think the Senator from Arkansas has been a very fine leaderin this. I think he made a number of good points. I think he made a numberof good points in debate. Had the amendment been drawn a little differently,he would have gotten more votes. But I believe we are down to the stagenow where it would be much better if we do not have another debate on this.Perhaps my view is tainted somewhat by wanting to finish this bill. ButI do believe you get less votes for a proposal that has already been thoroughlydebated the second time around, particularly on a Friday afternoon around6 or 7 o'clock.[S13MY8-46]{S5687}amendment <ITAG tagnum="89">amendment no. 2043</ITAG>[S13MY8-47]{S5687}WARNERMr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is very simple,and I will be very brief because I know the calendar that we face today.But as we go into the base requests for renewal, 1991 in the Philippines,it is important that we establish up front certain areas of identification,and one, of course, is the one of what those bases are going to cost theUnited States and whether or not, indeed, we should negotiate a rentalor whether it should be on the basis of simply a best efforts associatedwith foreign assistance. Our agreement is that we should provide at least$180 million, and we have exceeded that in the last 2 years. Last yearwe will have given the Philippines a total of $249 million and this yearit is anticipated to be over $350 million.  The significance of the amendment is to simply look to the alternativesassociated with, perhaps, replacing our requirements at both Clark andSubic with facilities somewhere else in that part of the world if, indeed,we cannot reach an agreement with the Philippines.  I have nothing but support for the Philippine Government and maintain thatsupport, but I think our negotiations should be based on a fair price.I think it should be recognized that we are a major employer in the Philippines,if the Philippine Government does not want us, we should be prepared togo someplace else. The purpose of this is to authorize a study to looktoward the alternatives, the cost/benefits of moving the base and the identificationof those countries.It is important, Mr. President, that the U.S. Government, both the administrationand the Congress, reflect very carefully now on the implications of therenewal of the bases agreement. We must know what our options are. Mr. President, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Manglapus, has beenquoted by the Washington Post as saying that if the United States wantsto continue to use the bases we will have to pay a higher price, and wewill be considerably limited in our flexibility to use them. This same gentleman has also indicated that even the most secure areasof the bases will be subject to Philippine inspection. ``There is alwaysthe suspicion,'' Mr. Manglapus has said, ``that something else may be inthose areas.''Mr. President, under the current agreement, the United States has promisedits ``best efforts'' to obtain at least $180 million a year in economicassistance for the Philippines in return for using the bases. In fiscalyear 1988 we will exceed this promise. The Philippines will receive a totalof $125 million in map funds and $124 million in economic support funds,for a total of $249 million. Other assistance accounts will bring the totalU.S. assistance to over $350 million this year. Mr. Manglapus has said he wants more. He has said that he may want $1.2billion a year!The Foreign Secretary has also suggested that the bases provide no usefuleconomic input to the Philippines and that they could easily do withoutthem. This is most puzzling. According to reliable figures the bases generate some $300 million in localspending per year. They are the second largest employer in the Philippine.In addition they provide jobs for highly skilled workers who could noteasily be absorbed into the Philippine economy. Mr. President, the Washington Post told us the other day that the administrationis considering a $10 billion multi-national aid program for the Philippines.President Aquino said that she does not want the matter of aid to the Philippinesto be linked with the bases issue. I am not surprised. Mrs. Aquino clearlywants to get the maximum amount out of the United States from whateversources. My question, Mr. President, is what are the bases in the Philippines goingto cost us under a new bases agreement and can we afford it? At the momentno one can answer that question. More importantly no one can tell us what the alternatives are and whatthey would cost. Mr. President, the cost of maintaining our forces in thePhilippines whether it is the salaries and operation and maintenance fundsthat are provided for in this bill, or the payments to the Philippinesprovided in our foreign aid bill, are legitimate costs of national defense,but no one can predict what the total bill will be in the years after 1991.Furthermore, Mr. President, no one can tell us whether the bases are worthit. The purpose of this amendment, Mr. President, is to get some answers tothose questions. We need to look at the whole spectrum. We need to knowwhat the strategic value of the two major bases, Clark Air Force Base,and Subic Bay Naval Base is. We need some facts and figures, Mr. President.We base our forces around the world, and we have three different ways ofcompensating the host countries for having our facilities on their soil.Some countries pay rent. In discussing this issue, Mr. President, we havebeen told by the administration and by various staff members of this bodythat the United States does not pay rent for military bases. That is nottrue, Mr. President. We do pay rent. In most of our countries where we have troops, we do not pay any compensation.For instance, Mr. President we pay nothing for the bases that our troopsuse in Korea and Japan_they pay us. We pay nothing for the bases our troopsuse in the NATO countries. In the Philippines, we have an extremely complexarrangement.Instead of agreeing to pay a specific amount, we promise our best effortsto obtain security assistance to compensate the Philippines for the bases.What this amendment would do, Mr. President, would be to require the administrationto focus on these three methods of compensation and advise us which methodor methods would make the most sense in this situation. I am not convincedthat the present method makes any sense at all.Another issue on which we need to focus is the value of these bases tothe Philippines. Secretary Manglapus tells us.The bases have no military value to the Philippines. The economic benefits,some $300 million a year to the Philippine economy, are not significantto the Philippines and could easily be replaced.Secretary Shultz said in Manila last year, ``if we are not welcome, wewill leave.'' Mr. President, I agree with Secretary Shultz. If I read inthe remarks of Mr. Manglapus a desire for the us to leave those bases,I think he is unwise, but I also think he should know that the United Stateshas other alternatives, that we are not subject to extortion.But, if we are planning to leave, we had better understand the consequences.And we had better have our alternatives laid out.Mr. President I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that wecan have those alternatives spelled out for us too as the negotiationsgo forth.It is my understanding it has been cleared on the other side and I would,therefore, move its adoption.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?[S13MY8-63]{S5688}DIXONMr. DIXON.

Mr. President, this amendment would permit the Air Forceto move forward expeditiously with its plan to sell or lease the Government-ownedRockwell industrial facility in Columbus, OH.This is a matter of great urgency. Last week, the plant contractor, RockwellInternational, announced that it was closing the plant and pulling outof Columbus. Rockwell, which employed about 7,000 people at the plant duringthe height of the B-1B bomber construction, announced that it would layoff its 1,100 remaining workers leaving the state-of-the-art manufacturingfacility empty.I understand certain manufacturing companies have expressed an interestin taking over the plant.However, according to the Air Force, current law prevents them sellingthe property for at least 18 months, and precludes them from leasing itat all.This amendment would permit the Air Force to enter into lease negotiationsright away.In addition, Mr. President, the amendment directs the Air Force to moveforward expeditiously with the cleanup of hazardous waste contaminationat the plant, and ensures that it will be cleaned up.What we want to do is enable a manufacturer to lease the plant while theAir Force cleans it up, but to ensure that it is completely cleaned upbefore responsibility passes out of the Government's hands.The amendment provides that the costs of the cleanup and the associateddisposition of the property be paid for from the lease and/or sale proceeds.In short, this legislation will give the Columbus, OH, business communitythe opportunity to get meaningful manufacturing jobs into the plant and,frankly, that is a major concern of this Senator.I want those workers who lost their jobs when the Rockwell plant closeddown to be given an opportunity to find new jobs in new manufacturing facilities.This amendment will make that possible.I want to commend the hard work done by Representative <T4>John Kasich, </T4>who represents the area in which the plant is located.Earlier this week, he arranged a briefing in Columbus among all the interestedparties. He has been a leader in moving this effort forward.Mr. President, I believe the amendment is good for the Air Force, it willhelp protect jobs in Ohio, and it will ensure that a potential environmentalthreat gets cleaned up.I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment.[S13MY8-79]{S5689}GLENNMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation alongwith my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator <T4>Metzenbaum. </T4>On May 5, Rockwell International announced that itwould be discontinuing operations at Air Force plant No. 85 located atthe Port Columbus International Airport in Ohio. The Rockwell plant andthe many Ohioans who have worked there over the years, have consistentlydelivered the finest aerospace products in the world. The closure of thisfacility means the layoff of the remaining 1,100 workers at the Rockwellplant in the next 15 months.Several companies have expressed an interest in purchasing this facilityfrom the Government, and this legislation will expedite the lengthy processof declaring this 3.4 million square foot facility excess to DOD's needs.The purchase of this facility by another manufacturer could mean the employmentof the thousands of Ohioans who have been laid off from the Rockwell facilityover the last several years because of declining defense business.The Air Force Systems Command has expressed its desire to dispose of 13factories it owns and maintains, including the Columbus Rockwell facility.The expeditious disposal of Air Force plant No. 85 in Columbus will thusserve the interests not only of the Department o Defense, but of the Columbus,OH, community as well.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment directs the Department ofDefense to investigate and report to Congress on the feasibility of usingvarious Defense assets_including over-the-horizon Backscatter radar_tohelp stop illegal foreign fishing in U.S. waters. The report would be due90 days after this legislation is enacted.There would be no question of detracting from regular functions of theDefense Department, nor adding any substantial additional duties. Thisamendment only calls for a study.There is already a precedent_a cooperative agreement between the militaryand the FAA, in which civilian international flights from Anchorage, AK,along with the Kurile Islands into Japan are closely monitored. This cameabout after the tragic and needless loss of Korean Airline flight 007.Extensive illegal foreign fishing in the Bering Sea is a well-known fact.The international waters in the central Bering Sea_nicknamed the DonutHole by fishermen_are used as a staging area for raids on U.S. waters.Vessels cross the boundary at night or under heavy cloud cover to avoiddetection. When U.S. Coast Guard aircraft or vessels approach, they quicklyflee back into international waters.The U.S. loss is severe. Other nations report taking over a million metrictons of fish from the Donut Hole annually, but there is reason to believea significant amount of the catch actually may be from illegal harvestsin U.S. waters.The total loss in U.S. jobs and seafood product sales is in the billionsof dollars, not to mention the damage to nontarget resources such as salmonand herring, which have the misfortune to share some of the same waters.The international waters of the Bering Sea include over 50,000 square milesof open sea beyond the U.S. 200-mile zone, with some of the most severeweather and climatic conditions in the world. The vast area and poor conditionsmake detection and apprehension extremely difficult.The enforcement problem is aggravated by a recent 50-percent reductionin Coast Guard air and vessel coverage. That reduction was caused by afalling budget and increasing demands for services which, although I supportthem as both necessary and well meant, are clearly beyond the Coast Guard'sbasic tasks of search and rescue, fisheries enforcement, and navigationassistance.There are a number existing technologies which may help direct our enforcementvessels and aircraft to specific areas where suspected violators are located.Examples include: First, the Backscatter radar combined with vessel-basedtransponders and possibly other radar technologies; second, a variety ofintelligence collection assets; and, third, other Defense assets on routineduty at sea.The new Backscatter radar to be based in interior Alaska will provide enhancedcoverage of a vast area. Experiments involving monitoring of surface vesselsalready have been conducted with over-the-horizon radars elsewhere, whichI regard as another precedent.The potential benefit to the United States would be substantial, derivednot only from halting these illegal harvests, but also from considerablesavings on the cost of effective enforcement coverage, and reduced riskof our patrols being detected in time for violators to haul up their netsand reach international waters.It is my understanding this amendment has been cleared on both sides, andI urge my colleagues to accept it.[S13MY8-93]{S5690}DIXONMr. DIXON.

Mr. President, the amendment I have proposed would allowthe limited delegation in these matters that Dr. Costello has requested.The intent is that this delegation will be made to a very limited numberof senior level officials. My understanding of the term ``senior levelofficial'' as used in the amendment is that for most of the smaller defenseagencies and field activities, such as the Defense Mapping Agency or theDefense Communications Agency, the designated senior official is likelyto be the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production and Logistics orthe Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement. In the case of the DefenseLogistics Agency, it is likely to be a general officer of two star rank.In total not more than half a dozen officials will be so designated.This amendment has been cleared by the OMB's Office of Federal ProcurementPolicy.

I understand we have a time limitation. Am I correct, Mr.President?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It is a 1-hour time limitation.[S13MY8-139]{S5692}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. And it is evenly divided?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.[S13MY8-140]{S5692}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I might need.Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to ensure a balanced navalforce structure. Currently, our plans for carrier expansion far outstripour modernization efforts for warships, planes, and munitions.Since 1981, the Navy has expanded from 12 to 14 carriers and it plans toadd a 15th carrier in 1990. This is in line with the Navy's plans madeat the beginning of the 1980's.Unfortunately, other vital Navy programs have not fared as well. Ironically,the most serious deficiencies are in precisely those forces needed to protectand operate the carriers.Navy plans at the beginning of the 1980's called for 137 cruisers and destroyersto escort the 15 carriers. Current programs will leave us with a shortfallof at least 20 ships in the 1990's.Navy plans at the beginning of the 1980's called for enough planes to operate14 active and 2 Reserve air wings. Current programs will leave us witha shortfall of over 150 planes in the 1990's.  Navy plans at the beginning of the 1980's called for enough modern air-to-airmissiles to arm these planes. Current programs will leave us with shortfallsof 50 percent of some categories of missiles in the 1990's.This is a seriously unbalanced force structure. Beginning in 1990, we willhave 15 carriers. But we will lack enough cruisers and destroyers to escortthem, enough planes to operate them all fully, and enough munitions toarm the planes.This unbalance is the consequence of an uneven distribution of budget cuts.Since we entered this period of static or even declining defense budgets,there have been significant reductions in the naval aviation plan, deepcuts in the munitions accounts and significant deferrals of cruiser anddestroyer construction. Aircraft carriers, however, remained untouched.Indeed, carrier modernization was actually accelerated in last year's budget.Our amendment seeks to restore some balance to the Navy budget. Specifically,it defers expansion to 15 carriers from 1990 until 1997 by retiring oldercarriers as new carriers enter the fleet. This early retirement plan wouldallow between $1 billion and $5 billion to be shifted to other ship, aircraftand munition accounts.This plan does not require any reductions in current carrier force levels.We have 14 carriers now. We would have 14 carriers under the early retirementplan. The only change would be a 7-year delay in the expansion to 15 carriers.This plan does not require the United States to abandon any internationalcommitments. We are meeting those commitments with 14 carriers and fourbattleships now. These commitments would continue to be met with the sameforce structure under the early retirement plan. The only change wouldbe that this force would not be expanded further until 1997.Finally, this plan does not delay modernization of the carrier force. Plansfor construction of new nuclear aircraft carriers would be unaffected.The only change is that the Navy would retire two older carriers as thenext two new nuclear carriers enter the fleet.Note that the amendment does not specify which two carriers would be retiredearly. That decision is left to the discretion of the Secretary of Defense.But, based on the Navy's current carrier retirement plans and its tesimonybefore the Armed Services Committee, we assume that the Secretary wouldretire our most marginal carrier_the two holdovers from World War II. Althoughthese carriers have had distinguished and useful lives and their crewscontinue to do a<ITAG tagnum="80">remarkable job operating these ships, they are still far less capablethan their modern equivalents. The older carriers deploy fewer and lesssophisticated aircraft; they face greater maintenance problems; and theyhave more severe operational restrictions in heavy seas. In short, thesecarriers are less capable in war and more expensive in peace. </ITAG>Mr. President, this amendment asks only that the Navy do what the otherservices have already done: to delay planned expansions in order to avoidcreating a hollow force. The Air Force has postponed achievement of 40air wings to ensure that it can fill its 35 wings with modern aircraftand munitions. The Army has delayed addition of two brigades to ensurethat its existing forces can field the best equipment and maintain highlevels of readiness. This amendment would simply impose a similar balanced force structure onthe Navy. It would hold carrier growth steady until the other elementsof the fleet can catch up. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Who yields time? [S13MY8-141]{S5693}COHENMr. COHEN. I yield myself such time as I require. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. [S13MY8-142]{S5693}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, this amendment was debated at length in the SenateArmed Services Committee and was rejected. It was rejected on a numberof bases. Sound practice, it seems to me, requires that we establish first a policyto determine what resources or requirements will be necessary to carryout that particular policy, and then provide the resources necessary toimplement it. We are required to defend the Atlantic, Pacific, the Mediterranean. PresidentCarter expanded our responsibility, as you may recall, when he and hisnational security adviser stood before the cameras and drew the equivalentof a line in the desert around the Persian Gulf. He said that we have astrategic interest over there, and we will defend that interest if we arerequired to do so. Ronald Reagan reaffirmed that commitment. So we have not constricted ourcommitments overseas. We have actually expanded upon them.   If we do not like this policy, if we do not like the requirements it imposesupon us, we ought to change the policy. But do not try to change the policyby cutting back on the resources. That is precisely what this amendmentwill have the effect of doing.  It will ultimately guarantee either inaction or retarded action or ineffectiveaction. It will guarantee failure at some point. And with every failurethat we experience the United States is going to have another self-inflictedwound upon its prestige as a reliable power.  We had a chance to change that policy just yesterday. We had a very significantvote on the Adams amendment. We had a chance to go on record as to whetherwe wanted to reject the commitment of our forces in the Persian Gulf. Therewas an overwhelming rejection of that amendment. But now in what we areunable to do or unwilling to do or categorically refused to do yesterdaywe are going to do indirectly by cutting back on our ability to maintain15 deployable carriers.  I think it is unfair to the men and women who serve in our Navy. Theirlives are on the line. We are asking them to work harder and remain longeron station, with very little respect for their lives. Yet, we sit herein the comfortable protection of all of these Capitol Hill police withbarricades outside, debating, with the only threat of a terrorist attackbeing that of a filibuster at 2 o'clock in the morning. And yet, we requirethese men to serve on stations for longer and longer periods of time, notonly exposing them longer to attacks, physical attacks upon their lives,but also to put tremendous strain upon their family lives causing themto want to leave the service early.  So I think this has a very dramatic impact upon our ability to maintainnot only morale, but our commitments worldwide.  I would like to take a few moments to talk about the aircraft carriersthemselves. These are our mobile bases. About 75 percent of all the crisesin recent years have been responded to not by submarines, not by land-basedaircraft, long-range bombers, but by aircraft carriers. That is the wayin which we project force. We cannot project force by long-range bombers.Some of us may recall what the French did in denying us overflight rightsduring the strike against Libya. So that is really not a power projectioncapability. We cannot project power by submarines. The only means thatwe have of projecting power on a global basis is through the carrier battlegroups.  I think we have to take this into account as we see the rise of nationalismspreading across the globe. We might have bases to compensate. Insteadof having aircraft carriers, we could have bases. How would you like torely upon Spain for having your base rights? They would like to remaina member of NATO, but they can send out one of our air wings, and say ``Getthe airplanes out. This is an anathema for us, to have the presence ofthe Americans, because it reminds us of the deals you made with Franco.''Look at Spain. Is that a reliable place to have bases? I doubt it.  How about Denmark? Denmark has made it clear_at least_that they are consideringthe possibility of barring from entering their ports any ship carryingnuclear weapons. They might even go as far as New Zealand and bar any shipthat is nuclear powered, including ones that might not even be carryingnuclear weapons. Well, there is one of our allies. We have only been talkingabout those nations where we might seek to put bases in the future. Thereis a possibility we may not have base rights even in Denmark.  I mentioned New Zealand. How about Greece? Anyone feel comfortable, goto sleep at night time thinking about the possibility of having more basesin Greece? Or Portugal? Or even the Philippines? We accepted an amendmenthere about studying the cost effective options for alternatives to basesin the Philippines.    What we are seeing around the globe is less and less inclination to allowthe United States to have even base rights or visitation rights.Oman? How about Kuwait? The Kuwaitis want some of our F-18's. Maybe weshould make a deal: We will sell them F-18's provided we can put basesin Kuwait. I doubt very much whether the Kuwaitis would be in a positionto accept that proposition.How about Bahrain or Saudi Arabia or Israel? Where exactly do we intendto go to establish base rights so that we can project power in time ofemergency?I suggest that the aircraft carrier provides the only effective, reasonablemeans of doing that in the foreseeable future.Those nations concerned about having an American presence on their soilnonetheless want to have American power present. They want to feel us butnot see us. They want us over the horizon. The only way you stay over thehorizon is through using aircraft carriers, and that happens to be ourfate for the immediate future.Mr. President, we can debate this at length. I have more to say about thisamendment, but there are others on the floor who wish to speak.I reserve the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.Mr. President, I remember that when I first came to the Senate, the distinguishedsenior Senator from Mississippi [Mr. <T4>Stennis</T4>] was chairman of the Armed Services Committee. As is hisstyle, he greeted me most warmly and recalled the many days we had workedtogether when I was Secretary of the Navy. As I look back on my 9-plusyears in the Senate, no other friendship has meant more to me than thatof this distinguished American and leader in the Senate, Mr. <T4>Stennis.</T4>How many times have we talked about the naval forces? I cannot recall.But I do recall in the past 2 or 3 years, as issues of the carriers havecome along, that he has reflected on his period in the Senate; and he saidevery time there is a crisis, the first question asked by the Presidentor the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the leadership of Congressis, ``Where are carriers today in the world? How quickly could one respondto that situation?''They are literally floating islands of America, in the wise view of Mr.<T4>Stennis</T4> and others who have observed this scene many more yearsthan I.I have watched_as the distinguished Senator from Maine has stated today_theerosion, the turmoil, the constant changing of our relationships involvingbase structures throughout the world.The constant is the carrier. It is always the carrier we call upon. Itis under the command of an American officer, who responds directly to thecommand of the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States,and whose several thousand crewmen salute and march off to any spot inthe world at any time, day or night, to defend the interests of this countryand those of our allies.The Senator from Maine correctly stated that our commitments worldwidenot only will remain the same, but, in all likelihood, will be increased;and should this amendment be adopted, the burden of this will fall uponthe crewmen who serve on these carriers.It brings to mind a rather sad chapter in the history of our Navy, andthat was the fall of 1972. We were in negotiations to try to terminatethe war in Vietnam, and the negotiations went back and forth. The orderscame from Washington to keep the carriers on the line, far beyond humanendurance.At that time, as Secretary of the Navy, I took a special trip with AdmiralCleary, the commander of all forces in the Pacific. The two of us visitedsome 23 ships in the Christmas period of 1972. I recall going aboard thosecarriers and looking into the faces of those men, who had been on station7 or 8 months_I cannot recall specifically the time. Not one port call,not one day deviating from their orders to defend the interests of thiscountry. Indeed, they were stretched to the human limit at that time.I hope we do not have similar occurrences in the future. I can assure Senatorsthat if we take the step proposed by this amendment, we could well be faced,once again, with pushing men, ships, and situations to the extreme limits.I strongly urge the Senate to look elsewhere in our constant search forsavings, rather than take this particular step.The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, andthe Chief of Naval Operations all support the requirement for 15 aircraftcarriers. They adamantly oppose early retirement.The Commander in Chief of the Atlantic Command, Admiral Baggett has stated:[S13MY8-147]{S5694}<ITAG tagnum="21">Effectively reducing the Atlantic carrier forces 20 percent for anannual savings of less than one-half of 1 percent of the Navy budget isnot a good tradeoff of warfighting capability for budget savings.</ITAG>Is there not a better way to save one-half of 1 percent of the Navy's budget?If the early retirement proposal is accepted, the number of carriers availablefor immediate deployment will drop from the current number of 13 to aslow as 12 in the early 1990's. This is due to the Navy placing an additionalcarrier out of service in the 1990's to replace nuclear reactor cores.Aircraft carriers are on-station now in the Indian Ocean. Because of lengthytransits to the Indian Ocean, five aircraft carriers are required to supportthis contingency operation. This operation is not a planned requirement;neither were the carrier operations against Libya or Lebanon. Carriershave been called upon in more than 75 percent of the crises to which wehave responded in the last 10 years. Because of the unplanned requirementfor aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf region, the United States isfailing to meet its commitment to NATO to station two carriers in the Mediterranean.At the present force level of 13 deployable carriers, freezing or reducingour carrier force structure will result in further inability to meet foreigncommitments.The United States is being denied landing privileges at overseas airfields.One wing of F-16's will soon be removed from Spain. Base restrictions arepossible in Greece or Portugal.The Senate Armed Services Committee report was quite clear with respectto carriers and overseas power projection: ``The committee is convincedthat aircraft carriers and their associated air wings are in many casesthe only option for overseas power projection and should be accorded highpriority within the Department.''Should our carriers not also be accorded high priority on the floor ofthe U.S. Senate?The Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, andthe Navy have estimated that the savings associated with reducing a carrierbattlegroup and an airwing from the Navy force structure will save $1 billionto $5 billion over a 5-year timeframe.This amendment if accepted will save $200 million per year out of a defensebudget of $300 billion per year.This savings equates to one-fifteenth of 1 percent of our defense budgetand is proposed at a time when our carriers are currently conducting operationsto ensure safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf region.Is there not a better way to save one-fifteenth of 1 percent of the DefenseDepartment budget?Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the <T4>Record </T4>a letter from the Secretary of Defense; also, letters fromthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations, whose combined50-plus years of naval experience bring to bear wisdom on this questionthat should be heeded by all Members of the Senate.There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">The Secretary of Defense,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, May 10, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>John Warner,</T4><ITAG tagnum="55">U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.</ITAG>[S13MY8-148]{S5694}<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Dear John</T4>: As a leading proponent of a strong National Defenseposture, you will appreciate that the capabilities of our Carrier BattleGroups are absolutely essential to our national security. The planned forcelevel of fifteen deployable carriers will support the current nationalstrategy and is endorsed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Unified andSpecified Commanders as the minimum needed. It is predicated on existingand future threats to our national security ranging from diplomatic crisesto limited war and conflict with the Soviet Union.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">History has confirmed the value of the aircraft carrier as an instrumentof foreign policy. It has been used in the overwhelming majority of criseswe have responded to in the last ten years. Reducing our planned peacetimedeployable force level to fourteen carriers will impair our ability torespond to crises. As you know, we have longstanding commitments to ourallies and friends and the current force of fourteen deployable carrierslimits our ability to meet these commitments without imposing unacceptablehardships on our people.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is no evidence to indicate that national commitments will decreasein the foreseeable future. In fact, low intensity conflict contingenciesrequiring conventional military force projection are likely to increase.This will require that we maintain, if not increase, aircraft carrier operationaltempo in the near term. The trends will impact adversely on the retentionof our sailors and the readiness of our equipment unless we attain theplanned force levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has affirmed that thereis no substitute for an aircraft carrier battle group.

It remains my strong belief that the requirement to achieve a 15deployable carrier battle group Navy at the earliest opportunity remainsvalid and we should continue to pursue it aggressively. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 15 carrier requirement is a result of analysis of the growingSoviet naval threat in areas of vital interest to the United States. Asyou know, we have commitments in Asia, the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf, theNorth Pacific, and our NATO responsibilities in the Mediterranean, NorthAtlantic, and North Sea.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The process by which force level requirements are determined originateswith the warfighting commanders in chiefs (CINCs) and is based on theirassessment of their specific needs to execute war plans in support of thenational military strategy, with a <T3>prudent level of risk.</T3> Their requirements are then assessed andreviewed by the Joint Staff and Services to provide an integrated nationalmilitary force which balances the detailed and specific requirements ofthe CINC with available national resources and priorities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fifteen carrier battle groups is a minimum deployable force levelneeded to execute the CINCs' war plans and terminate the war on terms acceptableto the United States. At this level, fighting a global war would requiresequential operations. ``Sequential operations'' is a phrase that is easyto say but very hard to do. It will require making difficult and explicitpolitical decisions that one region is less important than another or thatone ally will have to be left to its own devices in favor of another.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Very few other force requirements have received that extensive studyand analysis that the number of carrier battle groups have.

The ability to meet those commitments is an important factorin determining the proper size of the Navy, a question the Congress isreviewing again this year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Following the recovery of defense strength over the past seven years,the Navy's present size allows it to meet its commitments without unacceptablestrategic risk and without running its personnel and material readinessinto the ground. But as the number of commitments continues to grow, thesize of the fleet must grow accordingly. We must not return to the eraof the 1970s, when long, back-to-back deployments and unrelieved work loadsdrove so many thousands of our finest officers and petty officers out ofthe Navy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even when readiness is high, emergent requirements, such as in thePersian Gulf or during the Libyan crisis, put a considerable strain onfleet operating schedules. This is frequently manifested in reduced capabilitiesavailable for deployment to other areas of the world, where danger andcrisis are also endemic.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such a thing is happening today. In a recent dispatch to the Chairman,Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Galvin, U.S. Commander-in-Chief inEurope, wrote of his concerns for the impact that the Persian Gulf operationshave had on force levels in the Mediterranean, on NATO's Southern Flank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Your task of having to apportion naval striking forces commensuratewith regional needs and availability realities is not an enviable one,''General Galfin wrote, ``particularly now with the sustained effort in thePersian Gulf area. For my part, I have recognized the importance of thePersian Gulf situation and have encouraged a truly ``supporting'' rolefor the U.S. European Command. We have not quibbled as certain degradationsto our naval capabilities in the Mediterranean Sea have been realized.[But] the air arm of the 6th Fleet is central to my combatant efforts inboth the NATO and U.S.-only contexts. They are my artillery. The deploymentrate of carrier battle groups to the Mediterranean has declined from 1.9in 1986 to less than 1.3 in 1987. [In 1988 we project it to be even less].While numerically the carrier battle group surface force has remained constant,the capabilities of the force have declined. The bottom line is: carrierbattle group presence and quality reductions have had an adverse impacton my southern flank.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The Mediterranean is a very volatile area, wherein a potent navalpresence is respected by would-be adversaries. I am not so sure that wehave articulated sufficiently to others that fact or the implications ofone Mediterranean carrier battle groups in the NATO context. From a militaryperspective alone, the defense of the southern region is, to a very largeextent, naval air dependent. A cursory look at land-based combat powerin the region leads one to that conclusion. In this regard, one carrierbattle group is just not deterrence.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To General Galvin's letter it should be added that this representsa concern about only one region within the Navy's span of global responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recently some defense analysts have questioned whether the UnitedStates requires a Navy of 15 deployable carrier battle groups. As GeneralGalvin's letter makes clear_as our operational commanders have been statingfor many years now_in view of the threats to our security around the world,15 deployable carrier battle groups constitute a minimum essential requirement.Anything less would pose unacceptable risks, both strategically, to ourdeterrent capability, and internally, to the outstanding readiness of ourNavy personnel and equipment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I look to the Congress for continued strong leadership in this area.I have sent similar letters to Senators Nunn, Kennedy, Cohen, Stennis,and Stevens.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="57">C.A.H.

Mr. President, those who are arguing against this position make a numberof different arguments, and I would like to address them briefly. First, the argument is made: How are we going to live up to our commitments,all these additional commitments? The fact is that the major commitmentswhich expanded the role of the United States into the Persian Gulf weremade with the Carter doctrine in 1980. At the end of the 1970's, we sawthe fall of Iran, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the taking of the hostages.These events led to enunciation of the Carter doctrine, which has beensupported by President Reagan. Thus, by 1984, we had added a new commitmentfor a forward-deployed carrier with Indian Ocean. But I do not know ofany other new commitments that are loosely talked about on the Senate floor.In 1981, we had 12 aircraft carriers. I did not hear during this periodthat we could not live up to those commitments. Since 1981, our forceshave increased substantially. We have added 14 carriers and 4 battleships,and we are bringing an LHD on line by 1990. Two additional aircraft carriers,modern nuclear aircraft carriers, have been added to our ability to fulfillthose commitments. There has been no significant change in commitments,but we have substantial additional forces_two modern aircraft carriersand four battleships_to meet those same commitments. Our amendment maintainsthe 14 carriers; we are not cutting back. So if there is some idea that we are going to be running out on our commitmentsoverseas, I do not think that argument holds. We hear a second argument: What about the people serving in far-off, distantplaces, who are at risk while we are comfortable in the Senate? I do notunderstand the context of it; because if we are talking about people servingon those 14 aircraft carriers, they are the ones who are serving todayand they will be serving tomorrow. No change. I ask: What about those who are serving on the destroyers, who are goingto serve there for longer periods of time, and those on cruisers? We arefacing significant block obsolescence for many of our surface ships. Sowhen the argument is made about those men on the station, the fact is thatwith the two new carriers, the amount of time they have on station hasbeen reduced by 20 days over this period of time. But, unless we addressthe problem of block absolescence of our other warships, the time on stationfor their crews will go up as the number of ships goes down.You are going to find those people that are out in the Persian Gulf ondestroyers and cruisers are going to have to serve there longer. Why is not their interest, why is not their comfort, why is not their hardshipbeing recognized by this body? I just fail to follow the logic of thatparticular argument. Finally, Mr. President, I think you will find a difficult time in suggestingthat aircraft carriers replace land bases. We have major defense concernsin terms of our bases overseas. That exists today. It has existed in thepast, and it will probably exist in the future. It is going to take thebest in terms of defense planning and strategy to try to be able to dealwith it. But the idea that you need another aircraft carrier because wemay lose a base in Spain is unsustainable. That base in Spain is to provideair support for Central Europe. We do not have aircraft carriers to dothat. The bases that we are talking about around the world have important defenseresponsibilities but by and large that is a completely different responsibilitythan aircraft carriers. That has been commented on and testified on foryears in the Armed Services Committee. We ought to be dealing with the issues of overseas bases. There are seriousissues and questions. We are going to have to find out how to be able todefend our interests and the interest of our allies overseas. That is important.But aircraft carriers have not replaced these bases in the past nor shouldwe suggest that they do go at the present time.All you have to do is look through the Navy mission outline of what theybelieve the aircraft carriers are utilized for, and in no way does it suggestsubstituting for bases. Those are different issues, those are differentquestions, and they ought to be addressed.Mr. President, what we are talking about here is the savings of anywherefrom $1 billion to $5 billion. You can accept the high estimate of $5 billionor the low estimate of $1 billion. But last year we accelerated the twoaircraft carriers because we hoped to save $700 million. We really thoughtthat this was going to be an extraordinary savings on the Armed ServicesCommittee, and it is a significant one; whether you accept $1 billion or$5 billion, you are still talking about very considerable savings.There is also the issue of how many aircraft carriers are enough. In someprevious administrations, the Secretary of Defense has believed that 12carriers were sufficient. We have seen additional expansion of our commitmentoverseas in the Persian Gulf subsequent to the time that these Secretariesof Defense mentioned 12. But to meet those added commitments, we now have14 carriers.How the argument can be made that if we get 15 carriers, all of our problemsare going to be resolved in defense while if we have 14 they will not be?I think that is difficult to maintain. In my view, the required numberof carriers is a range. The floor is 12 carriers and the ceiling is the20+ carriers that the JCS state would be a ``minimum risk'' force. Withinthat range, you must assess the value of an additional carrier againstother priorities for the fund.The fact is, Mr. President, that we are going to face serious shortfallsin terms of the air capability of the Navy. This argument will be madevery, very effectively by my colleague, Senator <T4>Levin,</T4> who chairs the Conventional Force Subcommittee. We haveshortages of naval aircraft. We have shortages of surface ships of alldifferent kinds. And, we face shortages in terms of munitions.The savings that we have with the acceptance of this amendment will beutilized to meet shorfalls in these critical areas which are essentialfor our national defense.I reserve the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-152]{S5696}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senatorfrom Ohio.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes.[S13MY8-153]{S5696}GLENNMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am in great sympathy with what the Senatorfrom Massachusetts is trying to do in saving money on the defense budget.I truly am. But I regret that I have to oppose this amendment.We have held a number of hearings this year. In fact, in the last 2 yearswe have held hearings on strategy and on American military commitments;and then using that as a base on what to do with regard to the weaponssystems that we are buying.The impact of these early retirements will be that the Navy will not reachits goal of 15 deployable Carrier Battle Groups for the foreseeable future_ifever. This in spite of the fact that Secretary of Defense Carlucci, theChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Crowe, and the Joint CombatantCommanders around the world, have repeatedly stated that our defense strategyrequires a minimum of 15 deployable Carrier Battle Groups.Now, Mr. President, the proponents of this amendment have argued that theonly change to the Navy's force structure plan would be to retire 2 carriersearly and delay the expansion to 15 deployable carriers for 7 years. Further,that the Navy is currently meeting its commitments with 14 carriers andcan continue to do so for the next 7 years.Mr. President, this is simply not so. The Navy is not fully meeting itsworldwide peacetime commitments with 14 carriers and will not even do sowhen it reaches 15 deployable carriers, not to mention wartime. That iswhy our warfare commanders have consistently stated that 15 is the minimumnumber that prudent risk will allow. Even with 15 deployable carriers therewill still be risk involved.Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4>'s amendment would retire the USS <T3>Coral Sea </T3>and U.S.S. <T3>Midway </T3>and leave the carrier force at 14 carriers for an additional7 years.During that 7 years, the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>is scheduled for two additional extended deployments_normally6 months duration_before planned retirement in 1992; the <T3>Midway </T3>is scheduled for at least five more deployments beforeplanned retirement in 1997. I would just emphasize the obvious: if youretire those two carriers early, other carriers and their crews will haveto take up the slack or we reduce commitments, one or the other. That isa tough choice.Mr. President, the men and women in the military are often asked to domore with less, especially during periods of reduced defense spending.This has a devastating effect on readiness and retention.If we retire 2 carriers, it will mean that the 4,000-5,000 men aboard eachremaining carrier will be facing even longer cruises and spend less timeat home with their families and friends. Also, carriers could be deployingmore frequently than the current goal of 12 months between extended deployments,or we reduce the overseas commitment, one or the other.Mr. President, the fiscal year 1989 Defense bill currently before us containsa provision that would increase the aviation continuation pay for Navycarrier pilots from $6,000 to $12,000. Why is that necessary? As chairmanof the Manpower Subcommittee, I have held hearings and meetings on thissubject because there is a mass exodus from the Navy of carrier pilots.We are short 1,600 Navy pilots right now. Although there are a lot of factorsinvolved in this situation, especially increased airline hirings, the No.1 reason given for carrier pilots leaving the Navy is family separation.The same is true in other specialty areas also.So I can virtually guarantee my colleagues that the early retirement oftwo carriers will result in one of two things. If we keep our current commitments,it means the carriers are going to have to be out there longer, and itmeans we will have more trouble retaining our very skilled carrier pilotsand all carrier sailors, for that matter, and it costs some $6 millionto train a carrier pilot through his first 7 years in the Navy.I can also guarantee that increased family separation will have a verynegative impact on retention rates for both enlisted and officer personnel.Mr. President, the situation I have just described regarding the potentialimpact of early retirement of carriers is what I call a best-case situation.Let a crisis erupt anywhere in the world that requires the dedicated commitmentof one or more Carrier Battle Groups, and the situation gets worse_muchworse.Our only option, it appears to me, is to go with these 15 carriers, notfor this reason, but because of the other commitments we have around theworld.Currently, the Navy has a peacetime requirement to keep five carriers forwarddeployed in support of the combatant commanders: Two carriers in the Mediterraneanin support of NATO; two carriers in the Western Pacific; and one carrierin the Indian Ocean. I do not know where we would pull back from that.The Navy has stated, and I believe the sponsors of this amendment haveaccepted, that it normally requires three carriers to keep one carrierforward deployed on an extended 6-month cruise. I would stress the wordnormally and emphasize again that carrier requirements are a dynamic issueparticularly sensitive to national security objectives. Let me give youa graphic example here.Mr. President, a year ago this month, Senator <T4>Warner</T4> and I visited the Persian Gulf following the attack onthe U.S.S. <T3>Starke</T3>. We have a chart behind me here that I invite your attentionto. As shown on this chart, when we arrived, the U.S.S. <T3>Kitty Hawk</T3> was on station in the Indian Ocean having deployedin February 1987; <T3>Kitty Hawk</T3> was subsequently relieved in May by the U.S.S. <T3>Constellation</T3>. Since February 1987, we have had a carrier battle group on station in theIndian Ocean continuously, and as far as we know that commitment is goingto go on indefinitely into the years ahead. The boxes on this chart representon station time and the solid lines transit to and from the Indian Ocean.I would note that there is 3 months transit time involved for ships deployingfrom the west coast. Mr. President, as you can see, five carriers_not three_are required tokeep one carrier on station continuously in the Indian Ocean. This chart becomes even more meaningful when you realize that using the3-to-1 planning factor for the two required Western Pacific carriers, youwould need 11 deployable carriers in the Pacific alone to fully meet today'speacetime requirements. When you add the two carriers that the Commanderin Chief Europe requires on station continuously in the Mediterranean,we have quickly identified a requirement for 17 deployable carriers inpeacetime, if you wanted to keep it on the same rotation basis. Mr. President, add one national security crisis to the peacetime scenarioand the whole carrier requirement equation could go out the window. Finally, I would just add that implied in this amendment is that the <T3>Midway</T3> and <T3>Coral Sea</T3> are no longer combat effective. There is no questionthat they are less capable than our new <T3>Nimitz</T3>-class nuclear carriers; however, as you can see from thechart, <T3>Midway</T3> recently took her turn on station in the Gulf of Oman andcould have launched the same A-6 model attack aircraft used against targetsin the Persian Gulf. On the east coast, the <T3>Coral Sea</T3> just returned from another very successful 6-month deploymentto the Mediterranean. Operating the Navy's newest F/A-18 multirole fighterand attack aircraft, the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>spent 112 days at sea during the cruise, launched nearly8,000 sorties, and logged over 14,000 flight hours. Mr. President, the carrier battle group has been and will be for the foreseeablefuture the most versatile, conventional weapons system in our militaryarsenal. Given our current arms control environment, Mr. President, the carrierbattle group will assume an even greater conventional and nuclear role.As the recent Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy concluded: ``We should emphasize a wider range of contingencies, ``*** there is aneed for ``Versatile, mobile forces, minimally dependent on overseas basesthat can deliver precisely controlled strikes against distant militarytargets.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.The Senator has used the 5 minutes allotted.[S13MY8-154]{S5697}GLENNMr. GLENN. If I could have 1 additional minute.Mr. President, I will close by emphasizing what Secretary Carlucci statedin a recent letter to Senator<T4> Kennedy:</T4> ``Very few other force requirements have received theextensive study and analysis that the required number of carrier battlegroups have. A 15-deployable carrier battle group Navy is the floor, nota ceiling, for required force level.''Mr. President, I intend to oppose this amendment and I urge my colleaguesto do the same.[S13MY8-155]{S5697}GLENNMr. GLENN. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I also thank the distinguishedSenator from Maine.[S13MY8-156]{S5697}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to have the attention of the Senatorfrom Massachusetts.It was my understanding originally we would have to have 1\1/2\ hours andthat Senators would request time based upon that. It has since been clarifiedwe will only have 1 hour.I ask unanimous consent that perhaps we be given an additional 15 minutesequally divided. I could then accommodate the Senator from Ohio.Is there any objection?[S13MY8-157]{S5697}DIXONMr. DIXON. No.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is for an additional 15 minutes. Isthere objection? Without objection, the additional 15 minutes will be equallydivided.[S13MY8-158]{S5697}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if the sponsor wouldbe agreeable, to temporarily set aside his amendment. Would the Senatorfrom Massachusetts have an objection to a unanimous-consent agreement totemporarily set aside his amendment so we can go to an agreed amendmentand then come back to the debate?[S13MY8-159]{S5697}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would not object if I could have just a coupleof minutes to respond.[S13MY8-160]{S5697}DIXONMr. DIXON. Of course.[S13MY8-161]{S5697}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to work that out. Basically, what I would liketo try and do, if it is agreeable with the Senator from Maine, is havethe final 20 minutes evenly divided or a half an hour evenly divided. Iwould like to give the Senator from Michigan, who is chairing a hearing,some time. I would like to hear from the chairman of the committee, andthen I want to make some summary remarks. That would all take approximately12 or 14 minutes.I am happy, if it is agreeable with the Senator from Maine, to set thisaside for the consideration of other matters.Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio makes some points that I would liketo address just very briefly. On the number of aircraft carriers, we arenot reducing the number. There are 14 carriers today and there would be14 carriers under the amendment. I think that is as it should be, becausewe have not had a change in terms of requirements. Moreover, the amendmentallows modernization within the goal of 14 carriers. The two new ones willhave greater capabilities than the older ones that are retired for thereasons I outlined earlier_more planes, more efficiency, less maintenance.I was on the <T3>Midway </T3>off the Persian Gulf. That is an extraordinarily well maintainedship. I have great respect and a high regard for the personnel. But thefact is that it is more costly. If you take the testimony of Secretaryof the Navy Lehman when he was supporting the building of new aircraftcarriers last year, he announced that older carriers like the <T3>Midway</T3> are more expensive to maintain. You cannot change it now.Second, Mr. President, we talked, again, about the pilots and the pilots'retention. With the two new aircraft carriers, we have already increasedthe time in homeport by 20 days per year, according to the materials thathave been provided to us by the Navy. That is, I think, an improvement.So some improvement has been made.But, again, what we are talking about is pilot retention. This involves,not only length of carrier deployments, but pay levels, airlines hiringand a variety of other factors that I know the Senator from Ohio has workedon very assiduously.Further, when you are talking about pressure on the families, of Navy personnel,we are talking about the pressure of the families of those who are on surfaceships that are in increasingly short supply. They are away from their familiesand they are going to have difficulty holding on to those individuals astrained individuals. It is a pretty close trade, Mr. President.I believe that we have to be more imaginative in the retention of pilots.But I think, quite frankly, we have made progress. Effectively, what weare talking about is holding the ground at the present time.Finally, on the question about commitment in the Indian Ocean, becausethis commitment is furtherest from the United States it is the most difficultto sustain, requiring nearly four carriers to maintain a year-round deployment.But other commitments are not as strenuous. For example, with a carrierbased in Japan, it takes less than three to maintain a deployment.In the Mediterranean, there is also a ratio of less than 3 to 1 to maintaina forward deployment. We find other parts where the aircraft carriers havea shorter time on the station. I think that the point that is made is thatthe average of 3 to 1 for carriers to forward deployments is sound. Ithas not been altered. It has not changed. We are maintaining that withour amendment. I hope that we would be successful.[S13MY8-162]{S5698}DIXONMr. DIXON.

RESTRICTION ON SALE OF ARMS TO SAUDI ARABIA AND CERTAIN OTHERNATIONS<ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no sale of arms may bemade by the United States to Saudi Arabia or to any other nation in theMiddle East which has procured CSS-2 Chinese-made missiles unless the Presidenthas first certified to Congress that Saudi Arabia or such other nation,as the case may be, does not have chemical, biological, or nuclear warheadsfor such missiles. A separate certification is required in the case ofeach proposed sale of arms and may not be made more than 90 days beforethe proposed sale is to be concluded.</ITAG>[S13MY8-172]{S5698}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I submit this amendment on behalf of myself,Senator <T4>Levin</T4> and Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>.Mr. President, the purchase by the Saudis of the CSS-2 Chinese missile,or East Wind missile, which is a surface-to-surface missile with a 1,600mile range, is a destablizing factor in the Middle East. I think it isimperative that we recognize that it is destablizing; that we recognizethat this is not something which will promote stability in the Middle East;and that, finally, we make it clear that, since this missile is capableof carrying chemical, biological, and nuclear warheads, we want a certificationthat the Saudis do not have such capacity, that they are not intent ongetting such capacity, and that any time we are debating an arms sale toSaudi Arabia or any other country in the Middle East that has acquiredthis missile, we want certification that they do not have the capacityto put chemical, biological or nuclear warheads on their East Wind missiles.Mr. President, let me also make it clear that while the Saudis continueto state that their objective in acquiring this missile, a missile thatwas acquired without our knowledge, is to protect themselves from the Iranians,I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a menacing editorial cartoonwhich appeared in the Saudi newspaper Al Jaziraj. This is a newspaper that is at least influenced, if not controlled, bythe Saudi Government. It has a cartoon that depicits an East Wind missile.From this missile an easterly wind is flowing over a menorah which hasthe Star of David on it.I think it is important that we note that while the Saudis talk about Iran,the newspapers that they influence, if not control, draw such cartoons.I think it is imperative that the Saudis understand that if such an EastWind ever blows, it will reap a hurricane, not only from Israel, but fromthe United States.So I think this is an important amendment. I am delighted that it is supportedon both sides of the aisle. I think it sends a very clear signal.Obviously, if we are going to have stability in the Middle East we cannothave more missiles that are chemical, biological, or nuclear capable.I would like to note also that the Saudis did sign the chemical and biologicalaccords of 1971, committing not to proliferate in this area. All this amendmentdoes, in terms of those two important and dangerous weapons, is to committhem through proctoring by the United States, to an agreement they havealready reached; and, in addition, includes nuclear weapons.So I thank my colleagues for accepting the amendment.[S13MY8-173]{S5698}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is a simple but important proposal. I knowthat the Members of this body were as shocked as I was when we learnedthat the Government of Saudi Arabia had secretly procured CSS-2 ballisticmissiles from China. I joined with a majority of my colleagues in sendinga letter to the Secretary of State protesting this introduction of a majoroffensive weapons system into the Middle East and urging that any UnitedStates plans to sell weapons to the Saudis be reexamined in light of thisdevelopment.In the wake of this very disturbing event, the Saudis pledged that theywould not acquire nuclear or CBW warheads for these missiles. This amendmentwould simply require the Secretary of State to certify to the Congressbefore proposing any future arms sales to the Saudis or any other countryin the Middle East which acquires this type of missile that they have notbeen equipped with nuclear or CBW warheads. The amendment does not removeany of the other reporting or approval requirements for foreign militarysales, and it is not meant to imply that the Congress approves of the deploymentof this type of missile system in the region. I continue to believe thatthe acquisition of these missiles was a dangerous and destabilizing moveby the Saudis. I hope they can be persuaded to pursue their security objectivesin less threatening ways in the future.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.[S13MY8-174]{S5698}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, in his usual careful manner the Senator has addresseda very serious problem. The destabilizing nature of the Saudi missileswould be greatly magnified if they were equipped with chemical, biologicalor radiological weapons, and the United States should exert maximum pressureon Saudia Arabia to prevent such a development.This side is pleased to support the distinguished Senator from Texas andthe distinguished Senator from Michigan in this amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator fromTexas, Senator <T4>Gramm.</T4>The amendment (No. 2050) was agreed to.[S13MY8-175]{S5699}GRAMMMr. GRAMM.

I will do everything I can to do it shorter than that, but there are otherswho wish to speak on it. [S13MY8-185]{S5699}DIXONMr. DIXON.

I thank the Chair and my friend.Mr. President, this amendment would address some serious imbalances inthe Navy. It is an imbalance which was created when we decided to accelerateby 5 years the procurement of two aircraft carriers, but cut out 30 percentof the combat aircraft for the Navy in the 5-year plan. That is a seriousimbalance which is leaving the Navy short 150 to 200 combat aircraft.As a result of that shortage, the Navy has been forced to disestablishthe 14th carrier air wing this spring. They now have or are going to haveone less active carrier wing than they should have. There is another problem, too, and that is even with the disestablishmentof that air wing, there is still going to be a shortfall of the 150 combataircraft in the Navy.In addition to the shortfall of aircraft, we also have an aging in theNavy aircraft fleet. That fleet is older than it should be and is goingto get older yet.Let me just share with our colleagues these figures: The average age ofcombat aircraft in the Navy today is 10.3 years. The desired average agefor the fleet is 7\1/2\ years. So the Navy is already operating combataircraft that are nearly 40 percent older than the desired age goal. Thisis going to get worse unless we take some action, because it is going toreach an average of 10.7 years by the end of the 5-year plan.There is another problem. In addition to the fact we are short of aircraftin the Navy with the number of aircraft carriers which we are now planning,in addition to the fact our aircraft are far older than what is desirable,there is shortfall of spare parts for aircraft in the Navy. The Navy needs,according to its own numbers, $1.5 billion in spare parts for aircraftfor 1989, and yet because of the number of aircraft carriers, the requestis not what is should be. It is only for $1.2 billion. In other words,$300 million less for aircraft spare parts than we need. So we are going to have older aircraft than is desirable, fewer aircraftthan is desirable, and we are not going to buy sufficient aircraft spareparts to maintain the aircraft that we have.The bottom line is we are going to have whatever number of ships thereare, be it 575 or 600, but it is not going to be ships with the propernumber of planes, planes with spare parts, with planes that are of thecorrect age. They are going to be planes that are too old, too few, andwithout the spare parts to fly.That may work in peacetime. Mr. President, we may be able to do this inpeacetime by having fewer aircraft on our decks, transferring aircraftsfrom the ships entering port to those ready to depart and having feweraircraft in training squadrons, but this shortfall cannot be covered ifa war begins.The Kennedy amendment helps address this imbalance. By having one feweraircraft carrier, by taking the older one and retiring it early, we aregoing to have a truer balanced, solid Navy rather than a hollower Navywith more ships but without the means for those ships, without the spareparts for those planes and with planes that are too old to properly andsafely carry out the mission.I hope we will adopt this amendment. It will lead to a stronger Navy.I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields the floor.

Mr. President, the sole purpose of the amendment I have justsent to the desk is to begin protecting the United States from the greatestmilitary threat in its 200-year history: Soviet ballistic missiles.Last January, Senator <T4>Sam Nunn, </T4>chairman of the Armed Services Committee, gave a speechbefore the Arms Control Association after receiving their William C. FosterAward for Distinguished Service. In that speech, he was highly criticalof the Reagan administration's management of the SDI program. He statedthen that there is still time to make SDI stand for ``sensible defenseinitiative.''As the Senator from Georgia knows, I have been one of the strongest supportersof President Reagan's program, but also one of its most vocal Republicancritics. I charged, in essence, for the first 3 years of the SDI Programwhat the Senator from Georgia has so recently concluded: ``That the SDIprogram as it was configured would not produce real weapons that defendanything, whether people, U.S. strategic forces, or both.''As it was configured, the SDI Program would only produce more researchcontracts, and even those in dwindling numbers as Congress lost its tastefor a research and development program going nowhere. We have seen thatin both Houses for 3 years.The SDI Program changed, however, in 1986, and was reoriented by the Pentagon,partly under the guidance of the Senate Armed Services Committee, towardthe more realistic goal of defeating the objectives of a possible Sovietattack on our Nation, and thereby strengthening deterrence. I believe this sea change represented a very positive step toward creatingthe sensible defense initiative the Senator from Georgia has sought. Still,if his speech before the ACA is any evidence, he was not pleased with thischange.It was during that speech that the Senator from Georgia came up with theidea that underlies the effect of this amendment. If I may quote from his speech at length: [S13MY8-201]{S5700}<ITAG tagnum="21">I can envision certain defensive deployments which could be in theinterest of both our nation and the Soviet Union. If carefully redirected,our research efforts could produce options for limited deployments to dealwith the frightening possibility of an accidental or unauthorized missilelaunch. Such defensive deployments might be possible within the terms ofthe ABM Treaty or, at most, require modest amendment. </ITAG>It was with some trepidation that I formally embraced this offer of theSenator from Georgia to work toward the realization of what he termed,ALPS, or accidental launch protection system. I was concerned, as werea number of my colleagues, that this might be a trojan horse with whichto kill the SDI Program.Yet I decided that it was more important_more important for the countryand more important for the people we represent_to try to forge some bipartisanconsensus on defense, and therefore to pursue the course first suggestedby Senator <T4>Nunn.</T4>On January 26, I wrote him a letter asking if we might join together ina bipartisan fashion to work toward the implementation of his idea.I regret that I never received a response from the Senator from Georgia.Since that time the Strategic Subcommittee of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee held hearings on the feasibility of an ALPS system. I note thathe was not present at those hearings, but I am certain that his staff briefedhim on the presentations of both the Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas:Without a doubt, in their technical judgment, it would be possible witha decision made in this fiscal year, to have an accidental launch protectionsystem in place by the year 1995. These are the technical judgments ofcompanies that have been involved in ABM research, development, and deploymentfor over 30 years.I will include for the <T4>Record </T4>the presentation of McDonnell-Douglas which outlines aprogram for a treaty-limited initial deployment at around $8 billion.Mr. President, what we do not need, however_and the purpose of this amendmentis to avoid_is another sense of the Senate saying how much we like SDI.We do not need another study to tell us if we can do something we alreadyknow we can do.We need a commitment to action from the administration and most especiallyfrom the Congress; and around here that means dollars.In any case, the amount of funding in this amendment is $100 million, justbarely enough to begin planning for deployments at Grand Forks and to beginthe refurbishment of the missile silos and related equipment there.The money can be usefully used to set up production lines for booster systemsthat we know how to do today. We can begin establishing production facilitiesfor the seekers that will be placed on these boosters that we know howto build today. If someone has a quarrel that it is not enough, clearlyI would accept an amendment to make it a greater funding level.Mr. President, what would an Accidental Launch Protection System do? Itsfirst and primary objective would be the protection of the population ofthe United States from accidental or unauthorized launches. An initialdeployment at Grand Forks, for instance, could protect the United Statesfrom an accidential launch of the most powerful Soviet ICBM, the SS-18.While it would not be capable of stopping all Soviets missiles_such asthe submarine launched missiles_these could be handled by future deployments,such as around the national capital area or on the coasts of the UnitedStates.What else will an initial deployment accomplish? For one, it will givethe United States its first warm ABM production line since the early 1970's.All through the post-ABM Treaty era the Soviet Union has continued to improveand deploy newer and better ABM interceptors in its system around Moscow.This will give the United States the ability to surge deploy ABM's in themidst of a crisis or Soviet ABM breakout. It may also give the Soviet Unionsome pause in making a decision to totally breakout of the treaty themselves.As the Joint Chiefs of Staff have told the President on numerous occasions,the Soviet Union is in a better position to break out of the ABM Treatythan we are because of their deployed capability and warm production lines.While this argument may have some merit, it is also true that unless wedo at least what is allowed under the ABM Treaty_although the Soviets havedone much more_we will never be in a relatively advantageous position tocommit to the deployment of a comprehensive system.A deployment at Grand Forks, or any other place the Secretary of Defensedecides would be prudent, would also give us operational experience withABM systems. This is a clear advantage the Soviet Union holds over us now.Not only do they have dedicated troops of the PVO Strany for ABM defense,but their entire air defense network and radar base give them operationalexperience in dealing with all manner of aerial threats. We need that experience.A deployment commitment from this Senate would also give strategic defensesa boost within the military.There is no and has never been a constituency for strategic defense withinthe military establishment. That is primarily because there have neverbeen any operational users around which a constituency could coalesce.An initial deployment would begin to put SDI on an even budgetary footinginside the Pentagon bureaucracy.A deployment would give an impetus to the negotiation of real and stabilizingreductions in United States and Soviet strategic nuclear forces. Indeed,on the eve of the President's trip to Moscow, nothing could give him morebargaining leverage than a commitment from this Senate to an initial ABMdeployment. The Senator from Georgia rightly pointed out in his ACA speech:[S13MY8-202]{S5701}<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * such a system would not combine with offensive forces, eitherwith or without a START trenty, to pose a first strike threat. It couldbe designed so that it would not be destabilizing or prompt the SovietUnion to avoid or abrogate START.</ITAG>Finally, Mr. President, the deployment of such a system would help closethe advantage currently held by the Soviet Union in deployed ABM capabilitieswhile remaining consistent with the objective of deploying, at some futuredate, more comprehensive defenses against Soviet ballistic missiles.Mr. President, the choice here is a simple one. Do we or do we not stepup to our responsibility to the American people to provide for them thebest defense our scarce defense dollars can buy? Or do we hide in the sandand tell them that we have not yet figured out how to defend them perfectly,so we need not defend them partially? We can deploy an accidental launchsystem by the middle of the next decade; with a major commitment we coulddo it even sooner. The question is no longer one of feasibility but ofpolitics?

While I am sure you know we disagree on where theSDI program in general ought to be headed, I think it is important forthe security of the nation that we set those particular differences asideand work together to see this idea through. I believe there is the potentialfor genuine bipartisan support. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I propose that we jointly sponsor legislation that would bring thissystem into existence in a timely manner.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am greatly honoredto receive the ``William C. Foster Award'' from your prestigious association.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You are very kind to recognize my activities last year related tothe interpretation of the ABM Treaty and the role of the Senate in theratification process. There are, however, several other individuals whosetireless efforts were essential to our success in this undertaking. AmbassadorSmith, you would be at the top of the list, accompanied by senior membersof your SALT I Delegation, including Ray Garthoff, John Rhinelander, SidGraybeal, Royal Allison, and Harold Brown. I also believe that severalof my colleagues in the Congress deserve a large portion of this award.In particular, I want to pay tribute to Carl Levin, Bill Cohen, Les Aspinand Joe Biden, whose roles were crucial in the final outcome of this armscontrol and constitutional debate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the Reagan Administration begins its last year in office, the UnitedStates stands at a crossroads. Rarely in the post-war era has the dividingline between historic breakthrough and missed opportunity been so finelydrawn. Rarely has such a window of opportunity been presented for accomplishinghistoric improvements in the superpower relationship. Accomplishments thatseemed beyond reach during the Administration's first term no longer seemso far-fetched.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indeed, it is conceivable that during 1988, the Senate could havefive major arms control agreements placed on its calendar. In additionto the INF Treaty, the Senate could, prior to adjournment next fall, bepresented with a START treaty, a new accord on strategic defenses, andnew protocols on verification of nuclear testing which could clear theway for ratification of the long-pending Threshold Test Ban and PeacefulNuclear Explosions Treaties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Should these extraordinary events come to pass, you might well findyourself_much to your own amazement_presenting the next ``William C. FosterAward'' to Ronald Reagan. I hasten to add, however, that the odds thatsuch a new dawn could break during the last year of the Reagan Administrationare no more than 50/50.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whether 1988 is the occasion for such dramatic arms control agreementswill depend, of course, on unprecedented Soviet cooperation. Under Gorbachev,the Soviets have voiced an apparent willingness to embrace arms controlconcepts which just a few years ago would have seemed unattainable. Theseinclude disproportionate Soviet reductions, on-site inspection, cooperativemeasures for enhancing national technical means of verification, detaileddata exchanges, high-level military meetings, discussions on doctrine andforce postures, and important nuclear risk reduction measures. A word ofcaution is in order:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is too soon to determine how many of these concepts can be translatedinto reality. The West must predicate its positions on Soviet deeds, notwords. In areas such as conventional arms control, we must put Soviet rhetoricto the test with bold and innovative proposals of our own. The Soviet Union'sdisregard of fundamental human rights and unresolved violations of existingarms control agreements, especially the Krasnoyarsk radar, will continueas large impediments. There is no greater obstacle to improved U.S./Sovietrelations than the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Afghanistan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nevertheless, the advent of Gorbachev, glasnost and perestroika haveundeniably improved the overall climate for the conduct of superpower relations.Whether this opportunity will be realized will in large measure dependon whether the Reagan Administration takes what I will call this eveninga ``cold shower of reality.'' I</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">believe the Administration must recognize, and act decisively upon,several realities that define the parameters of the current strategic environment. </ITAG>[S13MY8-209]{S5702}reality on<ITAG tagnum="89">reality one: congress is not persuaded by the administration's ABMReinterpretation  </ITAG>[S13MY8-210]{S5702}<ITAG tagnum="21">Reflecting on the acrimonious journey of the Levin-Nunn provisionsfrom a committee amendment to enacted law, it is clear that the Administrationhas failed to make a persuasive case for reinterpreting the ABM Treaty.The ABM battle of 1987, in which your association played such an importantrole, demonstrated that at this time the Administration does not enjoymajority support in either the House or the Senate for the United Statesto breach the ABM Treaty as it was approved by the Senate.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Last year's vote on Levin-Nunn was not, however, an explicit referendumon the ``broad vs. narrow'' interpretation that settled this question forall time. What last year's Levin-Nunn battle does suggest is that the Administrationreluctantly recognied that the Congress does have the Constitutional powerof the purse and that its explicit approval must be secured before fundscould be spent inconsistent with the ABM Treaty as presented to the Senatein 1972. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To me, this debate went far beyond the arcane world of Article V,Agreed Statement ``D'', and such phrases as other physical principles andtested in an ABM mode. We must never forget that ABM Treaty, like all treaties,is the supreme law of the land under our Constitution.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If we decide the ABM Treaty jeopardizes our national interest, thenthe honorable course is to serve notice under the terms of the Treaty andwithdraw. When we are confronted with Soviet violations of the Treaty,we are entitled to take proportionate responses if the Soviets fail tocorrect their non-compliance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Let me emphasize, however, that manipulating and distorting the lawof the land is simply not acceptable. If we are going to have a safer andsaner world, the United States must stand for the rule of law. It is notout-moded for America to keep our word of honor_even in dealing with theSoviet Union.  </ITAG>[S13MY8-211]{S5702}reality tw<ITAG tagnum="89">reality two: our geneva arms control posture and our icbm modernizationpolicies are not in synch  </ITAG>[S13MY8-212]{S5702}<ITAG tagnum="21">Clearly, our goal should be a START agreement with sub-limits which,when combined with sensible U.S. strategic force developments, would significantlyreduce Soviet first strike incentives. Such an agreement would be in themutual interests of both sides, since both nations are under growing pressureto allocate less of their GNP to defense and each is nervous about thegrowing counterforce capability of the other side.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If, however, our ICBMs are to be based only in vulnerable, fixed silos_ordeployed in basing modes that require strategic warning_then I believethe degree of stability afforded under our own START proposal would bein serious question. I was pleased to note that on the eve of the Washingtonsummit, Secretary Shultz emphasized the importance of mobile missiles tosurvivability. He declared that we are prepared to allow mobile ICBMs underSTART if the Soviets will help us draw up effective verification provisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It would be a supreme irony, however, if the United States and theSoviet Union resolved their differences over START, worked out an effectivemobile ICBM verification regime, and produced an historic and potentiallystabilizing treaty_only to discover that both the Midgetman and the RailMobile MX had been killed in an act of domestic political fratricide. Ifthe administration terminates the Midgetman program, then I think thereis a good chance that the House of Representatives will kill the Rail MobileMX program. If we have no survivable mobile ICBMs to deploy under the STARTceilings, then our options for taking advantage of the opportunities forstability afforded by this prospective treaty are</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">greatly reduced. A more stabilizing nuclear environment requires notonly a sound arms control regime, it requires our Nation to make sensiblestrategic deployments.</ITAG>[S13MY8-213]{S5702}reality th<ITAG tagnum="89">reality three: start cannot be considered in isolation</ITAG>[S13MY8-214]{S5702}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Reagan Administration must recognize that START and SDI are incompletely different time frames. The opportunity to achieve historic reductionsin offensive forces is now. Realistic deployment options for SDI systemswhich could satisfy the Nitze criteria_or even scientifically necessarytesting that would require breaching the ABM Treaty_remain years in thefuture. In addition, the number of Soviet warheads which would remain afterall the START reductions were accomplished would still be more than doublethe number it had deployed at the time the ABM Treaty was signed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For these reasons, we logically should be able to implement deep cutsin each side's strategic offensive forces while relying on the ABM Treatyto provide predictability as to defensive developments. Unfortunately,the logic of the Administration's approach to SDI is in question.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current political reality is that some in this Administrationhave been ardently searching for near-term SDI tests in space that couldonly be conducted under the broad interpretation and which, if conducted,could trigger a Soviet reaction which could destroy the ABM Treaty. Inmy view, the motivation for such tests had been driven by ideology, notby scientific judgments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As long as this attitude prevails then it is impossible to be relaxedabout the possibility of a START agreement which is tied to an ABM Treatywhose application to advanced defensive technologies has not been clarified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In some respects, this could represent the worst case for the UnitedStates. The Soviet Union would be relatively free by the Administration'sdefinition to pursue its defensive testing program while in the UnitedStates each proposed test would become subject to a raging controversyas to whether it violated the ABM Treaty and whether it would result intermination by the Soviet Union offensive reductions under START.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I could not be comfortable with an outcome that resulted in the UnitedStates eliminating half its strategic deterrent while deep concerns remainas to whether the Administration's policy on SDI may lead to the removalof all restraints on Soviet strategic defenses, an area in which they havecurrent operational experience and near-term technical advantages. I wasencouraged by Secretary Shultz's statement during a November TV interview:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Predictability and stability . . . is just as important for us asit is for them, because probably right at the moment their ability to fieldwhat we think of as an inferior form of strategic defense is greater thanours. So we don't want to reduce our offensive system unless we have somenotions of stability, just as they don't.</ITAG>[S13MY8-215]{S5702}reality fo<ITAG tagnum="89">reality four: a sound sdi policy cannot be based on simplistic andmisleading slogans</ITAG>[S13MY8-216]{S5702}<ITAG tagnum="21">In the five years since SDI was launched, the Reagan Administrationhas consistently substituted slogans for objective and technically soundexplanations. Too often, SDI has been treated as a theology rather thana scientific research program. Reasonable questions have been met by thepolitical and strategic equivalent of the locker room battle cry, you gottabelieve.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">President Reagan's latest applause line on SDI_``we will researchit, we will test it, and when it's ready, we will deploy it''_raises severalSDI questions. First question: what is the ``IT'' we will research, testand deploy? Is ``IT'' the President's vision of ``a shield that could protectus from nuclear missiles just as a roof protects a family from rain''?Or is ``IT'' the Joint Chief's goal of a defensive system designed to destroy50 percent of the Soviet SS-18 force should they launch an all-out first-strikeon our land-based systems. Is ``IT'' intended to replace deterrence, orenhance it?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second question: assuming the Administration could agree on what ``IT''is, when can we reasonably expect to arrive at the point at which we couldmake a well-informed decision to deploy ``IT''? A year ago, some SDI advocateswere insisting that we already knew enough to commit to deployment. Thisprompted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Crowe, to complain ata January, 1987 hearing that, ``I hear so much said and written about it,as if it is out there in the parking lot, and we just do not know whereto put it.'' Admiral Crowe went on to say, ``we have not answered all theresearch questions yet, as a technical proposition, what the cost of themwill be, or whether they can be translated into a weapons system.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Third question: how much would ``IT'' realistically cost? Is the costin the range of $40-60 billion as estimated by General Abrahamson lastspring? Or is it the $100 billion estimated by the Marshall Institute andnow supported by General Abrahamson? Or is this projection too low by 300-400percent, as estimated by highly reputable research organizations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The wide gap in these cost projections reflects radically differentassessments of the Soviet Union's capacity and willingness to respond toa U.S. SDI deployment by proliferating decoys, switching to faster-burnboosters, and improving its ASAT weapons. Ironically, many of those whohave traditionally faulted the U.S. Government for underestimating thepace and scope of Soviet strategic nuclear developments are now implicitlyarguing that the Soviet response to SDI deployments would be modest andlimited. Some fervent SDI cheerleaders, in their effort to sell early deployment,are trying to convince us that we are in a contest with the Little Sistersof Mercy, rather than the Evil Empire.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fourth SDI question: what are the implications for U.S. military capabilitiesacross the board if, as part of its effort to sell SDI, the Administrationgrossly underestimates its true costs? Are we prepared to pursue SDI deploymentseven if it means we have to seriously erode our present conventional defensecapability in a post-INF NATO environment?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fifth SDI question: how do you decide whether ``IT warrants deployment?The so-called Nitze criteria of technical feasibility, survivability andcost-effectiveness at the margin have been endorsed by the President andwritten into law by the Congress. Most objective and independent analystsagree that a phase-one system based primarily on space-based kinetic-killvehicles could not satisfy the Nitze criteria. Is the Administration willingto confront the reality that SDI will likely have to go through anothergeneration of development, focusing on directed energy systems, beforehighly effective defense deployment options become technically feasible?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Final SDI questions: if and when credible SDI deployment options areavailable, how do we conduct a mutual transition toward a defense-dominantregime in a manner that increases crisis stability? What are the implicationsfor NATO's flexible response strategy if both superpowers are capable ofhighly effective ballistic missile defenses? How vulnerable would suchdefenses be to technological breakthroughs by the other side? Would high-performancedefenses on both sides give each side an incentive to use their limitedpenetration capability for the most lucrative targets? Ironically, someanalysts have concluded that if both sides have highly-effective defensesit could move us in circular fashion back to explicitly targeting populationcenters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Suffice it to say, these are serious questions about SDI which willhave to be answered by serious thinkers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite the record of the last five years, I believe it is still possibleto bring a coherent national policy out of the stew of politics, physicsand metaphysics in which SDI is now deeply immersed. There is still timeto make SDI stand for ``Sensible Defense Initiative''. This will not beeasy. Above all, we need</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">to agree that neither offensive nor defensive weapons are inherentlymore moral than the other. What is moral is that which works to preservepeace and human freedom.</ITAG>[S13MY8-217]{S5703}reality fi<ITAG tagnum="89">reality five: sdi must be placed in a broader context of nationalpriorities and national vulnerabilities</ITAG>  [S13MY8-218]{S5703}<ITAG tagnum="21">As we continue research and development on longer-term comprehensivedefense options, we must bear in mind that this goal is not a Holy Grailin and of itself. It is fundamentally wrong to believe that only SDI isdesigned to protect the U.S. population. Every dollar of our military expendituresmust be weighed as to its contribution to the protection of our populationand that of our allies.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If one looks to our inadequate conventional forces, our vulnerablecommand and control facilities, our virtually non-existent strategic airdefenses, and the fragile infrastructure of our civilian society, one canfind a number of vulnerabilities far easier and safer for the Soviets toexploit than an attack by Soviet ICBMs. The Soviets are able chess players,and good chess players rarely gamble their queen when they can wreak havocwith a pawn.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We are increasingly a society of networks_electricity grids, watersystems, oil and gas pipelines, telecommunications links_with highly vulnerablenodes to which we have given virtually no thought of protection, even againstthe simplest efforts to knock them out. One need look no further than Chernobyl,Bhopal and the recent oil spill in Pittsburgh to appreciate the realityof modern society's vulnerability to catastrophic disruption.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If we have a finite amount of money to spend and want to spend itin the wisest ways to protect ourselves, our children and our grandchildren,we must seriously assess whether devoting a very large share of it to deploycomprehensive defenses against ballistic missile attack is the most rationalway to proceed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As one witness before the Armed Services Committee noted wryly, ``TheSoviets could just put nuclear weapons inside bales of marijuana, sincethey know we can't prevent that from entering the country.''  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Or, as a top Soviet official said during the Washington Summit:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We won't copy you anymore, making planes to catch up with your planes,missiles to catch up with your missiles. We'll take asymmetrical meanswith new scientific principles available to us. Genetic engineering couldbe a hypothetical example. Things can be done for which neither side couldfind defenses or countermeasures, with very dangerous results. If you developsomething in space, we could develop something on earth. These are notjust words. I know what I'm saying.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My point is this: there is no rule of science that says ballisticmissiles will remain the most severe threat to population destruction.There is no reason why our adversaries could not shift the rules of thegame from physics to biology. There is no reason Third World countriesand terrorist groups cannot participate in the biological warfare arena.The superpowers have a mutual interest in preventing this development.Our challenge is to identify areas of clear mutual interest between thesuperpowers to limit potential new threats of the 1990s.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The reality of our society's vulnerability to such threats does not,however, mean that there are no valid goals for defenses. An effectiveU.S. research program in strategic defense technologies is necessary bothto assess their practical potential (including conventional applications)and as a hedge against a Soviet decision to break out of the ABM Treaty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, I can envision certain defensive deployments which couldbe in the interest of both our Nation and the Soviet Union. If carefullyredirected, our research efforts could produce options for limited deploymentsto deal with the frightening possibility of an accidental or unauthorizedmissile launch. Such defensive deployments might be possible within theterms of the ABM Treaty or, at most, require a modest amendment. If properlydesigned, such a system would not combine with offensive forces, eitherwith or without a START treaty, to pose a  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">first-strike threat. It would be designed so that it would not bedestablizing or prompt the Soviets to avoid or abrogate START.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In Washington, you cannot begin discussing an idea until it has beengiven an acronym. I might, therefore, suggest that we call this defensivesystem the ``Accidental Launch Protection System''_or ``ALPS''. Such alimited defense would of course have to be proved both technically feasibleand affordable. We would also have to carefully consider the extent towhich the other elements of the Nitze criteria would apply.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I believe both superpowers might find common interest in taking outsuch an ``insurance policy''. This concept is a logical follow-on to therecent U.S./Soviet agreement on Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers and couldbe coupled with other imaginative steps to help reduce the risk of accidentalor inadvertent nuclear war. For example, President Reagan and General SecretaryGorbachev could agree to make a simple but potentially very important pledgeto conduct unilateral comprehensive reviews of each nation's fail-safemechanisms guarding against accidental or unauthorized launches. This isan area in which I believe far too little attention has been devoted overthe last several administrations.</ITAG>[S13MY8-219]{S5703}Recommenda<ITAG tagnum="89">Recommendations</ITAG>[S13MY8-220]{S5703}<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Executive Branch is prepared to recognize and act upon theserealities, then I believe certain policy prescriptions logically follow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, even under the best arms control regime we can now envision,stability will require both continued strategic force modernization andeffective investments in research on defensive systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, we should continue development of both the Midgetman and theRail Mobile MX ICBM systems until a rational choice can be made based onsurvivability, stability and cost effectiveness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Third, we should withdraw our proposal in Geneva for a ban on allmobile ICBM's contingent on agreement on an effective verification regime.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fourth, we should settle the dispute with the Soviets both over theduration of the ABM non-withdrawal period and on how advanced technologieswill be treated during this period for purposes of complying with the Treaty.I believe the Administration should heed Ambassador Nitze's counsel andnegotiate with the Soviets on a specific enumeration of what types of SDIdevices can and cannot be tested in space during the non-withdrawal period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fifth, while maintaining an effective research program, we shouldset two separate but compatible goals for a redirected strategic defensiveeffort:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the near term, we should seriously explore the development ofa limited system for protecting against accidental and unauthorized launches.This should be coupled with a rigorous unilateral review by both sidesof their respective fail-safe procedures and safeguards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the longer-term, our goal should be to pursue research on advanceddefensive technologies, principally in the directed energy area, that offerthe best prospects for a possible comprehensive defense. This should includemuch greater emphasis on battle management and system-wide command andcontrol.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, the United States should not commit any deployment of comprehensiveballistic missile defenses unless:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Technical feasibility issues are settled;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Cost/effectiveness at the margin appears attractive;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. We have a reasonable assurance that highly effective deploymentscould be maintained in the face of plausible Soviet countermeasures;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. The transition to such defenses would not undermine stability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. Economic and political support for the long haul is assured;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">General Omar Bradley once said: ``Ours is a world of nuclear giantsand ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, moreabout killing than we know about living.

His speech todaycaught some arms control experts by surprise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">President Reagan's proposal to test and develop a space-based anti-missiledefense is confronting budgetary constraints, and the prospect for thestepped-up deployment of such a system in the early 1990's has faded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some critics of the Mr. Reagan's program, formally the Strategic DefenseInitiative but known as ``Star Wars,'' said today they feared that Mr.Nunn's speech would reinvigorate the program as well as the debate overthe need for such a defensive shield.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the Democratic candidates for President have been stronglyskeptical of the development of anti-missile systems, and none has urgedthat the United States seriously consider deploying a limited anti-missilesystem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An aide to the Senator said Mr. Nunn had developed his position overthe last few months. The aide said Mr. Nunn had concluded that an extensivespace-based system was unfeasible in the near future, and that he wantedto take steps to reduce the accidental risk of nuclear war.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many supporters of arms control have argued that limited anti-missiledefenses are costly and could provide momentum for bigger ones.</ITAG>[S13MY8-223]{S5704}extremely <ITAG tagnum="89">extremely expensive defense</ITAG>[S13MY8-224]{S5704}<ITAG tagnum="21">``A limited defense would be extremely expensive for very limitedcapability,'' said Spurgeon M.

I applaud the efforts of this distinguished subcommittee to explorethe prospects of a near term defense against a few missiles that mightbe launched by accident. Such a defense would capitalize on the technologysuccesses of the Strategic Defense Initiative research program. My remarkstoday will be based upon a study which we have done within McDonnell Douglasto understand how a cost effective ALPS might be architected. This studywas initiated several months ago and we will be revising it as we continuefurther analysis. It is clear at this point, however, that there are benefitsthat can be derived from an ALPS deployment and it is those benefits thatI will be talking about in more detail in the next few minutes.</ITAG>[S13MY8-231]{S5705}viewgraph <ITAG tagnum="89">viewgraph 1_alps mission</ITAG>[S13MY8-232]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">In order to develop an architecture for an ALPS deployment it is necessarythat we first understand the mission for that deployment. Senator Nunnsuggested in his speech on 19 January that such a system should safeguardagainst accidental and unauthorized ballistic missile launches into theUnited States. He further suggested that such a defensive deployment shouldbe accomplished, to the best of our ability, in conformance with the termsof the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, or at most, require onymodest amendments to that treaty. We can further state that such a systemshould strive for the capability to intercept all of the incoming reentryvehicles, i.e., it should be a low leakage system. And finally, it is importantthat we identify a system that draws upon our investment in ballistic missiledefense research and development, which most certainly means utilizationof elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program that arecurrently in development.</ITAG>[S13MY8-233]{S5705}viewgraph <ITAG tagnum="89">viewgraph 2_alps threat 1993</ITAG>[S13MY8-234]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">As a second step in developing a system concept for an ALPS deployment,we need to define the threat that this architecture must address. Sincethat threat is defined as accidental and unauthorized launches into theU.S., the question becomes, what is an accidental launch and how do wedefine an unauthorized launch? We have presumed, for our study, that anaccidental launch is a single ICBM or SLBM booster launch. If you lookat the worst case for such an accidental launch, we conclude that for theICBM it is an SS-18 with its 10 or more reentry vehicles or the SS-N-18launched from a ballistic missile submarine with its 7 reentry vehicles.We have further defined the unauthorized launch as a single flight of ICBMsor a boatload of SLBMs. The worst case for an unauthorized launch becomesa flight of SS-18 ICBMs with approximately 100 reentry vehicles. In thecase of the SLBM, it is a boatload of missiles launced from the Typhoonclass ballistic missile submarine which carries the SS-N-20 booster withas many as 200 or more reentry vehicles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">So, as we look at these definitions of accidental and unauthorizedlaunches, we can begin to understand that a treaty-limited deployment of100 interceptors at Grand Forks can handle the accidental launch case,however, complete defense of the United States cannot be achieved. Withonly these 100 interceptors we will be unable to defend against the moresevere unauthorized launch. I will come back to this point as a proceedfurther through the presentation.</ITAG>[S13MY8-235]{S5705}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 3_ATTACK CORRIDORS </ITAG>[S13MY8-236]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">This viewgraph portrays the approach corridors for the ICBMs launchedfrom Russia. You are aware that the Russians have located their ICBM launchfacilities across the bredth of their country. We have simply defined theapproach corridors here as a set of triangles with their apex at the eastand west ICBM launch points in their country. Additionally, you will noticethat we have the apex of a third triangle located just above Norway andSweden which is near the Typhoon submarine home ports or what are calledbastion. And as you can see, SLBMs launched from this bastion will lookvery much like ICBMs coming over the pole. I believe that we must alsoinclude consideration for the ballistic missile submarines operating inthe broad ocean area or in their patrol zones closer in to our east andwest coasts. While current Soviet operating doctrine would seem to mitigateagainst consideration of SLBMs launched from these areas, it seems to methat we would leave ourselves unnecessarily vulnerable if we fail to considerthem as we develop this ALPS architecture. </ITAG>[S13MY8-237]{S5705}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 4_ALPS DEPLOYMENT AT GRAND FORKS </ITAG>[S13MY8-238]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">Having defined the mission and described the threat this mission mustaddress, the architecture for a treaty-limited deployment at Grand Forks,we believe, should include the following elements: 70 Exoatmospheric ReentryInterceptor Subsystem (ERIS) plus 30 High Endoatmospheric Defense Interceptor(HEDI) interceptors installed in the existing SPRINT and SPARTON silosrespectively at Grand Forks. Utilization of the early warning informationavailable from Defense Satellite Program (DSP) and Ballistic Missile EarlyWarning System (BMEWS). Tying the Grand Forks facility for C3 purposesinto the Cheyenne Mountain facility and adding the battle management capabilityat that facility as well. The addition of a ground based radar (GBR) andthe ground based surveillance tracking system (GSTS) as the acquisitionand tracking sensors for interceptor commit and final engagement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This combination of acquisition sensors and interceptors will providea two layered defense system which will significantly lower the leakage.This dual phenomenology is achieved with the acquisition sensors becausethe operating band of the GSTS is in the long wave infra red i.e., optical,and the radar, in this case, operates at x-band radar frequencies. In asimilar manner the ERIS interceptor operates in the exo atmosphere whileHEDI completes its intercept in the endo atmosphere. Both of these interceptorsuse infra red seekers but ERIS is in the long wave infra red and HEDI operatesin the medium infra red waveband.</ITAG>[S13MY8-239]{S5705}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 5_TWO LAYERS, DUAL PHENOMENOLOGY INCREASE EFFECTIVENESS</ITAG>[S13MY8-240]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">As I mentioned before, the dual phenomenology that we are suggestingby the architecture that I have just outlined provides an opportunity forimprovement in leakage (probability of each reentry vehicle penetratingthe defense). With only one acquisition sensor and launching either anexo or an endo interceptor the leakage as you can see is approximately14 percent. If we launch two shots while utilizing the data from this singleacquisition sensor, we can improve leakage on the order of 6 percent. Withtwo acquisition sensors and two launches of the same kind of interceptor,the leakage improves to 4 percent. By using an exo and an endo interceptorwith the two acquisition sensors the leakage improves further to 2 percent.We can improve this further, as noted, by shooting two exo interceptorsand one endo interceptor and get to 0.8 percent leakage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Keep in mind, that since we have no defense system, the leakage inthe event of any kind of ballistic missile attack is 100%.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Let me go on and talk cost in the next viewgraph and then I will comeback and show you how this probability of kill relates to cost.</ITAG>[S13MY8-241]{S5705}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 6_COST FOR GRAND FORKS DEPLOYMENT</ITAG>[S13MY8-242]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">As you can see from this viewgraph we have estimated the cost of thesystem we have described for deployment at Grand Forks. These costs arebased for the most part, on cost estimating relationships (CER) that wehave developed from approximately 30 years of involvement in ballisticmissile defense activities. The HEDI, GSTS, and BM/C \3\, and system engineeringand integration (SEandamp;I) costs were developed using these CERs. The ERIScosts were provided by Lockheed and likewise the radar costs were receivedfrom Raytheon. As you can see the total cost for a deployment as we havesuggested at Grand Forks comes to just over $8 billion. The normal accuracyband of CERs is considered to be andplusmin; 20 percent. Based on this thetotal cost for the deployment could be as high as $10 billion.</ITAG>[S13MY8-243]{S5705}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 7_ALPS CONFIGURATIONS COST EFFECTIVENESS</ITAG>[S13MY8-244]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">I indicated to you earlier that I would show you the relationshipbetween leakage and cost. As you can see from this viewgraph, if we deploywith a single acquisition sensor and interceptor, the leakage will be inthe order of 5 percent and the system costs will be approximately $4 billion.If low leakage is indeed a requirement of this ALPS system, the two-sensor,two-interceptor deployment will be required to achieve leakages of lessthan 1 percent and the cost for this system will be approximately $8 billion.So it is clear that there must be an understanding of the mission requirementsbefore a decision can be made as to the architecture of the ALPS system.</ITAG>[S13MY8-245]{S5705}viewgraph <ITAG tagnum="89">viewgraph 8_grand forks alps deployment summary</ITAG>[S13MY8-246]{S5705}<ITAG tagnum="21">To summarize for a deployment at Grands Forks, we believe that itis appropriate to deploy two independent layers of sensor and interceptorsto achieve the desired low leakage. A single layer system could be deployedat a lower cost than that associated with the two layer system, however,the higher level of leakage becomes an important factor that must be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With this two layer system, both the ERIS and HEDI interceptors arecommitted early utilizing sensor data based on exo track. By making thisearly commit there is sufficient time for both interceptors to accomplishan intercept of the ICBM and long range SLBM over most of the United States.We are continuing our analysis to define how much of the United Statescan effectively be covered from the single site at Grand Forks, but wehave done enough to feel that some, if not all of the east and west coastscannot be covered effectively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We believe additionally, that a two layered system deployed at GrandForks will give us valuable experience in maturing the design for the deployedelements, in establishing production capabilities, in integrating the BM/C\3\,and finally in operating all of these systems together. I might point outthat the Soviets have many years of valuable experience with their twolayered BMD system around Moscow. This experience would provide an invaluablebase from which to proceed toward a more aggressive deployment, if thatdecision was made.</ITAG>[S13MY8-247]{S5706}viewgraph <ITAG tagnum="89">viewgraph 9_expanded coastal deployment for alps</ITAG>[S13MY8-248]{S5706}<ITAG tagnum="21">Up to this point I have talked about a treaty-limited deployment atGrand Forks. The threat, the treaty only allows the deployment of only100 interceptors. If you accept the definition of an unauthorized launch,a treaty-limited deployment simply does not allow enough interceptors toengage all of the potential incoming RVs. Additionally, as I stated inthe summary with regard to the Grand Forks deployment, it will be difficultto effectively defend all of the United States, in particular the coastalareas. With these things in mind, we have looked at a deployment schemethat would protect both the east and west coast. As you are all keenlyaware, there are significant national assets located in the band alongthe coasts of this country. If you provide additional defenses to protectthese areas you also gain additional defensive capability to conjunctionwith the site at Grand Forks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to protect the coastal regions, we believe that approximatelyfive defensive sites will be required. In the study we have done to date,we have looked at only HEDI interceptors at these sites, so the data yousee here will show only the HEDI interceptor. It is my belief, however,that there is a more cost effective deployment that would include ERISalong with HEDI, and we are studying this right now. Each the coastal sites,we believe, should be defended with approximately 140 interceptors. Thisinventory is based on the number of reentry vehicles that could be launchedfrom a Delta III class ballistic missile submarine. We have used for thestudy to date, the ground based radar at each of these sites for forwardacquisition and tracking purposes, however, the GSTS could be used forthis function instead of the GBR. While we suggested tying the Grand Forksfacility to Cheyenne Mountain for purposes of BM/C\3\, for these coastalsites, it will be preferable to utilize the distributed battle managerapproach. This means that while each coastal site would receive a ``missilelaunch authorized'' signal from Cheyenne Mountain, the battle managementfunction would be accomplished at each site.</ITAG>[S13MY8-249]{S5706}VIEWGRAPH <ITAG tagnum="89">VIEWGRAPH 10_COASTAL TARGETS VULNERABLE TO SLBM THREAT</ITAG>[S13MY8-250]{S5706}<ITAG tagnum="21">You are all very much aware of the national assets located within300 miles of our coastlines.

The initialoperational capability (IOC) for the Grand Forks site would occur approximatelyone year later. IOC, for the purposes of this schedule, was defined asthe point at which ten percent of the interceptors were installed in thesilos. It is possible, that by using a program management approach similarto that which was utilized for the Delta 180 program, this schedule couldbe shortened by as much as one year. Another area that would require accelerationby the acquisition agency in order to shorten the time to IOC would bepreparation of the environmental impact statements required by the elementcontractors and for the launch facilities.

I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 5 minutes.[S13MY8-260]{S5707}BONDMr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I rise insupport of his amendment, which I am pleased to join as a cosponsor.I spend a lot of time traveling throughout Missouri, and I spend a lotof time talking to the people of my State. When the conversation turnsto our Nation's defense and to nuclear weapons, I often ask people whatthey think the United States would do in the event of an accidental missilelaunch by the Soviets, or in the event a Khomeini or Qadhafi were to gethold of a nuclear missile and use it against the United States. The answeris almost always the same_people say, ``We'd shoot it down, of course.''And when I tell them that we do not have the means to do that, they areshocked. I can understand their reaction. It seems only logical that after 40 yearsof living with the threat of nuclear disaster, we would have at the veryleast developed the means to defend our cities against one nuclear missile.Mr. President, I have long believed that we should deploy a system capableof defending against an accidental nuclear launch or against the actionsof terrorists or outlaw nations. Thus I was heartened when the discussiondeveloped about an accidental launch protection system. The possibility of an accidental launch is not merely a hypothetical possibilitythat simply can be dismissed. There are thousands of nuclear warheads deployedall over the world_as much as we hope it will never happen, it seems quitepossible that some day an accident will occur. I, for one, do not wantto have to continue to tell my constituents that we in the Congress refuseto protect them against that contigency, despite the fact that we havethe technology to do so. An accidental launch is not the only problem we face, however. In an alarmingtrend, we are seeing more and more countries around the globe attemptingto acquire ballistic missiles. Most recently Saudi Arabia deployed Chineseintermediate-range ballistic missiles. And many other countries_includingBrazil, Argentina, India, Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Taiwan_either alreadyhave ballistic missiles or are in the process of developing them. And theSaudi sale shows that it is only a matter of time before the countriesthat are producing ballistic missiles begin transferring them to thirdcountries. With these facts in mind, it seems all too possible that the leader ofa terrorist nation could acquire ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads_oreven more likely chemical warheads_and either hold our Nation hostage orwipe out innocent civilians.   The money we are proposing today would allow the United States to takea first step toward a system that could protect us against such a threat.There is yet another reason we should approve the amendment before us today.Over the past few years we have spent billions of dollars researching astrategic defense system. I have been a strong supporter of that researchand I hope that one day that research will result in a system that makesthe world a safer place to live.I think it would be a mistake, however, to delay until we can deploy afoolproof missile defense system. In fact, I am skeptical we will everbe able to develop a foolproof system. There is a lot to be gained fromdeploying a limited system now. Most important, it will give us the abilityto conduct operational testing on an actual system_it might allow us touncover and work out bugs that might not show up in the laboratory.Mr. President, as we all know, the Soviets have deployed an extensive ABMsystem around Moscow. This system not only gives them the type of protectionagainst accidential launch that I have discussed already, but it givesthem a tremendous headstart should they ever decide to abandon the ABMTreaty. In the event of a Soviet breakout of the treaty, they would beable to take advantage of years of production knowledge and warm productionlines to quickly deploy a nationwide missile defense system. The UnitedStates, on the other hand, would be forced to start at a disadvantage indeveloping systems and deploying radar and control systems in an effortto catch up with the Soviets.Mr. President, the amendment we are proposing today is a reasonable andmeasured effort to deal with the concerns I have set out above. HEDI andERIS are promising technologies that may well serve to fill what is nowa gaping hole in our Nation's defenses. I commend the Senator from Wyomingfor offering it and I urge my colleages to support it.I yield the floor.[S13MY8-261]{S5707}WALLOPMr. WALLOP.

The amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming was a surpriseto me, and I did not know about it. It is in his right to offer whateverhe wants whenever he wants. These are matters that have been looked intoat considerable length by the Committee on Strategic and Nuclear Deterrenceunder which this measure would fall.There are many good things that have been said in support of this amendmenton the floor. Some of the things that have been said are subscribed toby this Senator. I would assure the Senate that we have looked into thesethings in great detail. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator<T4>Nunn, </T4>made a major speech that touches on some of the conceptsof the amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming and others.I would simply say that regardless of the merits of this proposal I thinkthis is the wrong time for the U.S. Senate on the spur-of-the-moment amendmentoffered by the Senator from Wisconsin to be getting into this particulararea. I will not go into any great detail. Suffice it to say we are headedfor a knock-down, drag-out, if you will, in conference with the House ofRepresentatives on the whole matter of strategic deterrence. Not only isthere an all-out attack, as the Senator from Wyoming knows full well, onthe SDI Program, not only does this Senator think that we should considera reasonable research program on SDI, and I have stood on the floor andargued successfully on that matter on numerous occasions including thelast 2 days.So I think there should be no question about the intent and the views ofthe Senator from Nebraska. The Senator from Nebraska happens to feel andcautions against adopting the amendment that had been offered by the Senatorfrom Wyoming because if this amendment were to be adopted I would suggestto you that it is going to complicate even further the already-strainedrelationships between the House committee of jurisdiction and the Senatecommittee of jurisdiction when we go into conference with them on a wholeseries of matters. Because not only is the SDI funding involved in this,it also involves a very definite misunderstanding. There are differencesof opinion on such strategic matters as the MX rail garrison proposition,the small ICBM, and so forth and so on.While I happen to feel that it is worthy that we have discussions on thematters that are brought up by this amendment, I happen to feel that theonly real chance that we have in going ahead with some research on theSDI and the reasonable amounts given the attitude of nearly half of thisbody, and a majority of the House of Representatives, I think it wouldbe wrong if we would further saddle and complicate that problem by adoptingof the amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming.Therefore, I would offer that caution and offer that as an explanationfor the reason that I will oppose this amendment to the Senator from Wyoming,whom I know is acting in very good faith on what he firmly believes in.I just say that if there is one real reason that we should consider theSDI Program in the future, as I stated on the floor in recent debate onthe SDI proposition itself in the attempts to cut that, was we want togo in with as strong a position as possible.If there is one real reason to continue research and SDI, it is the propositionto address the accidental launch proposition that concerns the Senatorfrom Wyoming and concerns the Senator from Nebraska. I think this wouldbe the wrong time, the wrong place, and the wrong action to take by adoptingthe amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming.I reserve the remainder of my time.[S13MY8-265]{S5708}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.[S13MY8-266]{S5708}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator <T4>Danforth </T4>be added as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [S13MY8-267]{S5708}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, looking at what we have in the bill, and ifI may have the attention of the subcommittee chairman_I think this is animportant debate. I do not want it to be separate speeches that go offinto space and they are not responded to because I intend to response tothe Senator. First of all, looking at what the committee has done, and it is good, Igrant, but this is basically a truth-in-advertising amendment to what theyhave done. You have fenced $200 million for the advanced launch system;$175 million for the boost surveillance and tracking system; you have a$202 million for ERIS; $150 million for HEDI; $17 million for researchon gallium arsenide integrated circuit technology. Basically what you aresaying is we know how to do these things. They are the near-term technologiesthat can be applied today to America's defense. What is America to say when we use as a debating reason on the floor thatwe will not defend them because we have a complicated relationship withthe House? I grant the Senator we do. I have no doubt. I watched it. ButI would also tell the Senator that ever since I have been here I have beentrying to push this from the status of research into the status of a programwith a goal. And there is no goal. This amendment contains a goal. It islimited in scope. It fits in perfectly into phase 1, as the President'sscience adviser, Dr. Graham, has said. He also said there is no technicalreason why we cannot do these things. So what are we saying to America? We know how to do this. There is no technicalreason why we will not do it. We are not going to do it because we havea complicated relationship with the House? Somehow or another I think they expect more of us in the judgments thatwe possess than to say it is too difficult politically. They want to bedefended. America believes it already is defended and it supports defenseoverwhelmingly. As the distinguished Senator from Missouri said earlier,the American people are offended when we tell them otherwise. My whole point is that research creates no constituency, either in Congressor in the military. I have watched this program defunded year after year. I have watched ourefforts slide into the abyss of other priorities that are real programs,bending real metal, with real and achievable ends. The way to do nothing is to fund research. The way to do nothing is toform a committee. The way to do nothing is not to create a constituency.Nobody in the Department of Defense wants to do this. There is no missionanywhere to do this. We are going to say that we are going to assign themission sometime, but we have not. We have not defined the mission. How much people do you suppose watching us in America today know that nowherein the missions of the forces of the United States is there a mission todefend against Soviet missiles? Not in the Air Force, Navy, Army. We cannotget the Pentagon behind it. Careers are built by people doing specificthings, not looking at things they might do. We have demonstrated the capabilities of these weapons. We are not sayingthat they must choose any one of them, but we know how to do it. Sincewe know how to do it, America is entitled to have it. I reserve the remainder of my time. [S13MY8-268]{S5708}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 1 minute? [S13MY8-269]{S5708}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.

[S13MY8-271]{S5708}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I say to the Senator from Wyoming that he is right on target.This is the time for Congress to either fish or cut bait, to make a decisionwhether we are going to defend this country_and that is why we have a defensebudget_or whether we are not. That is really what the Senator is talkingabout. I thank the Senator for bringing this to the attention of the Senate. Ilook forward to voting on it, to see where we stand on it. [S13MY8-272]{S5708}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, there is an argument going on as if this violatesthe ABM Treaty. No, it does not. But the Soviets have. One of the arguments that is driving this Senator absolutely up the wallis the statement from the Joint Chiefs, including their chairman, thatbecause the Soviets have done so much work within and without the treaty,they are in a perfect position to break out if we do anything in our ownbehalf. What kind of nation is it that refuses to move when it is threatenedby things it has not done that the other side, legally and illegally, hasdone? This is an important decision for America, to do something or to continueto study. I reserve the remainder of my time. [S13MY8-273]{S5708}EXONMr. EXON. I yield myself time from my side. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee, Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>, will be adamantly opposed to this amendment, for reasonshe will state. In answer to the questions that have been raised by my friend and colleaguefrom the neighboring State of Wyoming, I simply want to say that it isstrange, indeed, when it has been conceded that the Department of Defenseis opposed to the amendment being offered by the Senator from Wyoming,that the Joint Chiefs are opposed to the amendment being offered by thedistinguished Senator from Wyoming, that the chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee is opposed, as is the chairman of the Strategic Subcommitteeof Jurisdiction, for some of the reasons I have already stated.   How wise does everyone think it is for us to micromanage such an importantsubject from the floor of the U.S. Senate? How many times have we heardthe cries: ``Quit micromanaging everything from the floor of the Senate''?I cannot think of a worse case of micromanaging than what this amendmentattempts to do.I emphasize again that I am listening, I hear, and I know some of the concerns,legitimate concerns, being addressed by the Senator from Wyoming. I simplysay to him that if he continues to press this amendment, which complicatesour relationship with the House of Representatives_and I certainly wouldadd a caveat. I do not agree with the statement that the Senator from Wyominghas made_why should we do something, and how do we explain the fact thatwe are not doing this, that, or the other thing because the House disagrees?I simply say that, from a practical standpoint, if the Senator from Wyomingcontinues to push this cause, I suspect it is going to be defeated on thefloor of the Senate; and when that is done, the House of Representativeswill be pointing to that when we go to conference with them, and anythingwe might be able to do to move something along in this direction will befurther complicated, rather than being enhanced.I assign the remainder of my time to the chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-274]{S5709}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.[S13MY8-275]{S5709}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, in view of the fact that this side has takenless time, as my friend from Wyoming knows, I understand there are onlyabout 8 minutes remaining in opposition. The distinguished chairman ofthe committee would like 10 minutes, and the distinguished chairman ofthe subcommittee would like five. I ask unanimous consent that the amountof time still allocated, which is only about 8 minutes, be expanded to15 minutes.[S13MY8-276]{S5709}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, how much timeremains to me?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight and a half minutes.[S13MY8-277]{S5709}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. If the Senator were to include an additional 4 minutes forthis side, I will not try to use it, but I think we should have some kindof balance.[S13MY8-278]{S5709}DIXONMr. DIXON. All right.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and itis so ordered.Who yields time?[S13MY8-279]{S5709}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, first, let me say that I am grateful to the Senatorfrom Wyoming for his focus on this point, this ALPS system, because I dobelieve that the overall defense of our Nation should begin with a systemthat is researched and developed and if feasible, deployed, to deal withthe accidental or unauthorized launch threat, rather than the bolt outof the blue 10,000 missile threat. So I am with him in that concept.  I differ with him on the amendment, and I will give my reasons.  Mr. President, back in January or February of this year, I suggested examiningthe feasibility, affordability, and arms control implications of an AccidentalLaunch Protection System [ALPS], and there has been a wide ranging andhighly constructive response both within the U.S. Government and by privategroups and individuals.  Reviewing the pros and cons of ALPS is now on the agenda of the StrategicDefense Initiative Organization [SDIO], the Defense Acquisition Board,the Defense Science Board panel headed by Dr. Everett, the House ArmedServices Committee special panel on SDI, and the Office of Technology Assessment.In addition, ALPS studies have been conducted by a number of defense contractors,including Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas, and by analysts at such outsideorganizations as the Heritage Foundation, High Frontier, the Carnegie Institute,the Committee for National Security, the Center for International Securityand Arms Conrol at Stanford University, and the Federation of AmericanScientists.  So this proposal is getting a lot of attention.  Although the studies which have been completed to date reach differentconclusions as to the ultimate advisability of ALPS and cost and performanceestimates are not firm, several general themes appear to be emerging fromthese studies.  Before I talk about these themes, I think it is important for our colleaguesto understand that there is a difference between protection against accidentallaunches and protection against what is known as unauthorized launches.An unauthorized launch could be a rather large threat, because if the commanderof a submarine offshore decided to launch, in whatever procedures the SovietUnion might have, then that could be a large number of missiles; whereas,an accidental launch is more likely to be one, two, or three missiles. It is a different type of threat, and I would like to see us devise a systemagainst both. There are differences as to what can be done against bothscenarios.  A requirement that ALPS have a high-confidence intercept capability againstworst case unauthorized SLBM and ICBM launch scenarios would most likelynecessitate a very robust defensive system which would increase costs substantiallyand create obvious problems for the caveat that the system  * * * be possiblewithin the terms of the ABM Treaty or, at most, require a modest amendment.''. There are many who would disagree with that goal, but that was my viewand remains my view at this time. Second, a limited ALPS system could, nonetheless, provide some protectionagainst some unauthorized launch threats and could limit somewhat the consequencesof worst case unauthorized launches. Of course, the effectiveness would go up. The worst case unauthorized launch,for instance, could be as many as 120 Typhoon missiles coming in very close.That is a pretty large scenario. The third theme that emerged is on the deployment of 100 fixed, land-basedABM interceptors at Grand Forks, ND, to defend against a single ICBM launchedaccidentally from the Soviet Union or against a single SLBM launched accidentallyfrom waters relatively adjacent to the Soviet land mass appears to offermuch better prospects for meeting the criteria which I think are in order_againthis is my view and not all views_of technical feasibility, affordability,and compatibility with the ABM Treaty. This limited capability, however in terms of a fourth emerging theme mightbe significantly eroded, or perhaps even negated, by Soviet decoys or otherpenetration aids_penaids. In other words, if the Soviet Union takes steps to counter an accidentalsystem by putting penaids or decoys on their missiles, and they viewedthis as a beginning of a much larger system, then we would have to changesignificantly our assessment about the capability of protection based oncurrent technology. The degree of degradation depends upon what assumptions are made concerningthe radars and sensors to be used in an ALPS system. Some proposed radarscould raise again treaty compliance issues on ABM. Since ALPS would functionoptimally in a strategic environment in which Soviet missiles were notequipped extensively with highly capable penaids or other countermeasures,the question of the likely Soviet response to an ALPS deployment, includinga treaty-compliant deployment, is obviously a critical issue. I am nottalking about negotiated response with the Soviets. I am talking aboutwhat they actually do to their systems. The final couple of themes: This point underscores the importance of anothercriterion I advanced in my speech, I made in January that ALPS ``not combinewith offensive forces, either with or without a START treaty, to pose afirst-strike threat. Obviously, if the Soviets believe that we are developing a system thatcould join with offensive forces at this time or actually deploying thatcountersystem, it has a great deal of bearing on their response. To the extent ALPS is perceived by the Soviet Union as a logical follow-onto previous initiatives for preventing accidental war that is in the mutualinterest of both nations, the chances that it could serve a constructivepurpose are enhanced. On the other hand, if ALPS is seen by the Sovietsas a stepping stone to a far more extensive phase one SDI deployment, Sovietactions may attempt to counter the system<ITAG tagnum="80">in which case we have to reexamine the technical feasibility. I amnot saying it becomes impossible at that stage. I am saying that we haveto have a different kind of response in response to their counter.</ITAG>Finally, in this regard, more attention needs to be addressed to another,closely related, recommendation in the speech I made in January, whichreceived very little attention but which I felt was one of the most importantparts of that speech, and that is that the review of ALPS ``be coupledwith a rigorous unilateral review by both sides of their respective fail-safeprocedures and safeguards.'' I do not suggest an arms control deliberationon fail-safe procedures at this juncture. I believe it ought to be unilateral.I think the chances that any kind of real verification of such fail-safeprocedures is very remote, but I do think a unilateral type review on bothsides would be a very significant step forward in terms of both stabilityand safety. In other words, both sides should take a look at whether theyhave done everything humanly possible to protect against an accidentalor unauthorized launch, including but not limited to the capability ofboth sides which I would like to see explored very carefully of being ableto knock down their own missile if it is shot accidentally. That is somethingthat could greatly increase the safety of mankind if we can both have fail-safeson our own missiles.There are a lot of complications. I am not ready to say we ought to dothat. I am saying we ought to seriously consider it and carefully considerit and I would feel better if I thought the Soviets were considering itthemselves. If both sides were highly confident that the other side, actingunilaterally, had taken fully effective steps to prevent or counteractaccidental and unauthorized missile launches, then an accidental disasterfor the world and for our two countries would be greatly reduced.My objective in making the ALPS suggestion last January was to catalyzea debate on this issue, and in that regard I am most gratified by the response.At this time, however, it would be premature to reach any final judgmentsor to mandate through legislation a commitment to any specific programmaticoption. In particular, I want to consider the results of the SDIO study,which will not be available before this summer, before deciding where theALPS idea goes from here. And I also would like to see what this administrationthinks in terms of reviewing our fail-safe procedures.I have not had a chance to discuss this in detail with Senator <T4>Warner</T4> lately, but over the course of the last several years,we have discussed whether our committee may very well go into the failedsafety capability and it would be a highly sensitive undertaking. It wouldbe taking a long time. It would be behind closed doors. It might be oneof the most important functions we could perform for the country and forthe future generations.For these reasons, I am opposed to the amendment by the Senators from Wyoming.I do not agree with the finding stated in the amendment that ``a decisioncan be made with confidence to deploy an Accidental Launch Protection System[ALPS].'' I do not agree with earmarking $100 million from SDI accountsto deploy ALPS. And I do not believe we can commit at this stage to a specifictwo-layer ALPS architecture, as is specified in the amendment.In other words, Mr. President, while I believe this is a worthy subject_itneeds attention, and I congratulate the Senator from Wyoming for bringingit to light and for pushing this concept_I do not believe we are readyto make a decision to deploy this kind of system yet. We have to have moreinformation. We have to have more thought. We have to have more assessmentof risk. We have to look at other alternatives. We have to look at thecost and we have to look at the feasibility.So I am not ready to vote for this at this time and I would urge the amendmentbe tabled.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Leahy</T4>). The Senator from Nebraska.[S13MY8-280]{S5710}EXONMr. EXON. How much time remains left on each side?The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California is recognized for 3minutes.[S13MY8-284]{S5710}WILSONMr. WILSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered bythe Senator from Wyoming. I think that for the reasons that he has alreadyarticulated it is really not premature to be thinking about this kind ofsystem. In fact, I congratulate the chairman of the Armed Services Committeewho has now left the floor, Senator <T4>Nunn. </T4>I think he did serve the purpose that he sought. He didstimulate a good deal of thinking. A number of people, obviously, had beenconcerned with this.One thing I would seek to correct: I believe my friend from Nebraska, thevery distinguished and able chairman of the Strategic and Nuclear ForcesSubcommittee, made the comment at least so I understood him to say thatthe Department of Defense is opposed to the amendment. Checking that wefind that they have no position. I am not sure they have had an opportunityto determine what their position would be.But what I do think is true is that it is clearly not premature on thetiming of an attack, not by the Soviet Union but by someone else.Now, what is the likelihood of such an attack? Obviously it is impossiblefor anybody on this floor to say. But what we do know is that there hasbeen nuclear proliferation, that there has been a proliferation of thekind of technology that is capable of making an attack of this kind againstthe United States as an act of terrorism by someone who is not responsibleand we have, certainly, reason to fear terrorism from a number of quarters.There is certainty that the deployment of such a system would in fact contributegreatly to the knowledge. It would give us experience necessary if we wereto move to a more complete system. So I think that there is every reasonto be discussing and actually passing an amendment of this kind at thistime.I will not take more time, Mr. President. I will simply say that it isquite true, as the Senator from Missouri emphasized in his remarks: Gointo any town meeting in America and ask the American people: ``Do we have,in your judgment, an adequate system of defense against ballistic missileattack?'' Well, about half the arms will go up in the air. You no longerask that question after you have asked it a few times because you do notwant to embarrass your audience. The fact is they are shocked when theylearn that we have absolutely no defense beyond the hoped for deterrenteffect of an existing counterforce. That is not enough, Mr. President.It really is not.The American people are entitled to better protection than that. And thisis the first step toward achieving it.So I commend my friend from Wyoming and urge the support of his amendment.[S13MY8-285]{S5710}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. I thank the Senator from California.I yield myself 6 minutes of the time remaining.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.[S13MY8-286]{S5710}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, my friend from Nebraska accused me of micromanaging.Let me make a statement here and now that there is no managing. Managingis totally absent. All that is taking place is researching. What we areseeking to do is, in fact, put ourselves into a position where there issomething to manage, and that does not exist today.With regard to the House, 167 Members of that House supported an amendmentthat called for the deployment of ALPS. So it is not true that there isno support in the House for this measure.I would say to America tonight, today, anytime, that every year we researchis 1 more year in which America is consciously undefended; purposefullyundefended. This is a decision to break out of that pattern of studyingthings and get into doing things.The perfect is the enemy of the good. We have good equipment. We have goodcapability. We have good men and women, in and out of uniform, who arewilling to do the work to defend the Nation. We cannot do it perfectly,but we can do something. Today we do nothing, and it is shameful.All the organizations mentioned by the Senator from Georgia are studying.Not one institution is doing. Hundreds of institutions are studying. Notone is doing. The questions for this Senate and the questions for Americaare: Where do we begin? When do we begin? Do we always have tomorrow beforewe make a commitment?Now, the Senator from Georgia said that there is a difference between anaccidental and unauthorized launch. Of course there is. But because thatdifference exists, does it mean that we cannot do anything about somethingthat is within our reach today? Heavens, that is a bad thought.What we do by doing something is we begin training, we begin designing,we begin communicating, we begin to make warm production lines, we beginwhat we know how to do.The Senator from Georgia says the U.S.S.R. will take steps to counter.Why would the Soviet Union put penaids on something designed to preventagainst an accident? Now, that either speaks to the Soviet Union or itspeaks to us. If they would, we better not stop here but get right quicklyinto phase 1, which this amendment is designed to be consistent with.We can upgrade after we deploy. There has been no system that America hasever built that has not been upgraded after we deployed.The Senator from Georgia in his speech said that this could be designedso that it would not be destabilizing or prompt the Soviet Union to avoidor to abrogate START. It is a stepping stone to full deployment. If thisSenate wants to go beyond an ALPS, it is within its reach to do so.But that is not the purpose of this amendment. This amendment says:[S13MY8-287]{S5711}<ITAG tagnum="21">America, we can protect you against a lot of accidents that will killa lot of people, more than Chernobyl, more than anything we have seen.</ITAG>We could do that, and the committee is telling us, ``Fine, we will not.''So every time we say take no steps, take another study_as the Senator fromGeorgia said, we have a study now and we have to wait until we get onethis summer. When I began calling for strategic defenses, I was told ``Waituntil the Fletcher commission study comes in. Wait until the study comesin. Wait until the study comes in.''When the one comes in this summer, it will pose a question that we willhave to study again. It is important for America to do something and doit now.To say we are always dependent on the arrival of a study is to say to Americathat this Congress, whose oath it is to protect, this Senate is navel-gazing,and I do not mean ships.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator <T4>Kasten</T4> be added as a cosponsor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.Who yields time?[S13MY8-288]{S5711}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the time remaining on each side?The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the proponents, 5 minutes; 3 minutes to theopponents.[S13MY8-289]{S5711}EXONMr. EXON. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the amendment?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered on the amendment.[S13MY8-290]{S5711}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientsecond.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S13MY8-291]{S5711}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, when we come to voteon this, which I understand will be after we vote on the Kennedy amendment,I will move to table. I would at this time, though, because I think debate has about run out,unless there are some others who wish to be heard, I would be preparedto yield back the balance of the time on this side with a final appealto the Senator from Wyoming. I renew that appeal. I advise the Senator from Wyoming that I believe the cause that he espouses,both the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and this Senator havesaid is something that should be considered. We happen to fully agree thatthe cause being advanced by the Senator from Wyoming would be hurt andnot helped if he persists to push for a vote on this amendment. As I have stated previously, if this amendment would pass it would complicatedramatically working out anything that could encourage such a move in theupcoming conference with the House. And if the Senator pursues this forthat and other reasons, I think it will be defeated on the floor of theU.S. Senate. And other than to record a vote, I have never quite understoodhow defeat moves forward a proposal unless you want it for other purposes.So, I, therefore, appeal to the Senator from Wyoming, since he has madehis case and since many of us have advanced the fact that he has made hispoint and made it well, I think discretion would be the better part ofvalor in this instance. I would appeal to the Senator from Wyoming to withdrawhis amendment and allow us to work out what we can in conference with theHouse of Representatives. [S13MY8-292]{S5711}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I say to my friend that I have no intentionof using the entire amount of my time. I will be prepared, after yieldingto the Senator from Missouri, to yield back the balance of my time. Mr. President, it is not an appropriate reason to make no judgment to saythat it will complicate a conference with the House if we pass it. It iseven less an appropriate argument to say that we should not express ourselveson this issue when what has happened is that we have avoided making a decisionon this thing now since 1981. The first amendment the Senator from Wyomingoffered, in fact, at one time committed this Senate and this body to deployment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senator from Wyomingcannot be heard.[S13MY8-293]{S5711}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. In 1981 this Senate voted, I believe, 93 to 0 to deploy a space-basedsystem. So it is not new to us. It is time that the sides begin to be madeknown to the public. It is not offered with an ulterior motive. The problemis that until the American people know they have a choice, no choice willbe made.If it is not this year, it may be next year; it will be sometime. It willbe made.So I say to my friend I have no intention of pulling down the amendment.I would be loath to complicate his life but his life will be complicatedwith or without me. The House has passed an amendment which is similarto this but is only a study so I would say to my friend the groundworkis laid for moving a study to deployment and that would be the argumentbetween the House and the Senate; not whether to study or not.Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator from Missouri.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.[S13MY8-294]{S5711}BONDMr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I would saythe discussion we have heard so far probably outlines better than any reasonor argument that we could make why it is appropriate to move forward toexamine the feasibility of the ALP system. The modest amount that has beenrequested to be earmarked in the SDI Program for this purpose will giveus a much better idea and lead the way so that we could make the decisionby the mid-1990's to have an ALP system.I have been most impressed by the leadership of the distinguished chairmanof the Armed Services Committee who initially conceived this idea and pointedout that we must resolve more questions before we deal with it.I think that the amendment by my distinguished colleague from Wyoming givesus the necessary research tools to make those judgments.I yield the floor.[S13MY8-295]{S5711}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Wyoming?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining.[S13MY8-296]{S5711}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.[S13MY8-297]{S5711}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of thedistinguished Senator from Wyoming.The Senator from Wyoming has for years been in the forefront of supportfor more emphasis on strategic defenses. In many respects, his longstandingvision is now the framework for the Strategic Defense Initiative Program.This Senator has followed the SDI Program very closely, and finds thatmany aspects of the phase I program, which is now moving in the directionof a full scale development decision in 1992 or 1993, are consistent withwhat the Senator is calling for.Indeed, the committee bill includes a provision that protects the fullamount requested for the major technologies that would constitute an accidentallaunch protection system.This Senator believes that an accidental launch protection system shouldbe emphasized, and accelerated, as a treaty compliant leading edge of aphase I strategic defense system. I would be glad to join with the Senatorfrom Wyoming and other Senators in seeking a refocussing of the SDI Programalong those lines.I believe an ALPS system could be deployed earlier than any of the projectionsnow being discussed for a complete phase I strategic defense system, andI will vote with the Senator from Wyoming to make that point.[S13MY8-298]{S5712}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, let me make this statement. I understand theSenator from Nebraska is going to move to table this and I appreciate thereasons why.I do not in my mind question his loyalty to the SDI Program. It is my beliefthat those who vote for this amendment are voting to build.

The question recurs on the amendment of the Senatorfrom Massachusetts. The question on the motion to table is temporarilywithheld.Who yields time? The Senator from Maine.[S13MY8-303]{S5712}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 2 minutes.[S13MY8-304]{S5712}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I rise todayin strong opposition to the amendment offered by the senior Senator fromMassachusetts. I can find nothing in my colleague's amendment so compellingas to convince me that we should be party to the reduction of our aircraftcarrier battle groups from 15 to 14.I have heard suggestions that the early retirements of both the <T3>Midway</T3> and the <T3>Coral Sea</T3> are not really significant militarily, that by substitutingother ships to meet certain mission requirements we will not have seriouslydiminished our capabilities. That is simply not the case. In the eventthat we have a need to project force in support of our national strategyon land or on the oceans, only the carrier battle group contains sufficientforce to guarantee air superiority to our forces on the ground, as wellas ensuring control of the local seas.These sophisticated weapons systems have proliferated throughout the ThirdWorld. Every nation now has the capability to acquire sophisticated weaponsand become a threat to its neighbors, if it chooses to do so. The UnitedStates must face that new reality when planning its global strategy andfunding its Armed Forces. We must now assume that we will face a high-tech,complex and sophisticated threat whenever and wherever our Navy sails intoharm's way. No longer can we assume the Soviet Union is the only seriousthreat to our forces. Unopposed landings and air superiority can no longerbe taken for granted anywhere in the world. The presence of an aircraftcarrier is now required more than ever.The concept of using small carriers and amphibious assault ships as substitutesfor large deck carriers was rejected by this body long ago. The experienceof the British in the Falklands only served to reinforce that decision.They lost three ships to 1950 vintage aircraft because they did not havethe superiority in the air which could have been provided by a carrierbattle group.Simply put, 15 carrier battle groups represent the minimum force neededto safely fulfill our global commitments.Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this <ITAG tagnum="80">amendment. We need more carrier battle groups, not less.</ITAG>I want to say one thing in closing, if there is another moment here. Thinkabout the young sailor in the fleet that is doing the work out there onthe deck. Think about the young people that we are asking to go out inharms way, spend many, many months at sea with very little liberty timein oftentimes very hot or very cold, very uncomfortable weather. If thethreat is no less and the carrier battle groups still have the deployment,we will be asking those young people to deploy for longer periods, notshorter periods of time.Therefore, we will have a retention problem.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Idaho has expired.[S13MY8-305]{S5712}COHENMr. COHEN. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Virginia.[S13MY8-306]{S5712}TRIBLEMr. TRIBLE. I thank the Senator.I rise in opposition to this amendment. Early deactivation of a carrieris shortsighted.Time and time again, we find the central feature of our naval strategyunder assault. Last year, the effort to authorize and appropriate fundsfor two new carriers came under attack. Yet for many months now, our battlegroups in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean have been guaranteeing thefreedom of the seas and maintaining the energy ``life line'' to the West.Our presence in the Persian Gulf is yet another instance in which the Navyhas demonstrated the wisdom of a forward deployed strategy and the utilityof big deck carriers.The issue before us today is whether we prematurely jettison militarilyuseful assets. I say no.The <T3>Coral Sea</T3> and the <T3>Midway</T3> must remain in the fleet until the <T3>Washington</T3> and the <T3>Lincoln</T3> are fully deployable. Both the <T3>Coral Sea</T3> and the <T3>Midway</T3> have just completed successful deployments and the Navyis confident that they will remain able to fulfill their missions and meetany demands.Mr. President, the amendment before us would seriously jeopardize our nationalstrategy. It rejects established defense policy. It rejects our forwarddeployed strategy. It should be defeated.And what consideration has been given to the sailors and their famileswho would bear the brunt of this amendment? Today our carrier based personnelare at sea for 6 months at a time. We all know the strains imposed by deploymentsof this length. Yet the Senator's amendment would sentence fleet sailorsto even longer periods of time away from home and port 7, 8, 9 months ata time.Mr. President, our national commitments will not change. This amendment,will mean that our fleet sailors will unnecessarily bear the hardshipsof lengthened deployments. Morale will suffer and we will lose trained,experienced personnel. And the Navy will be forced to recruit and retrainreplacements_an unnecessary cost and an unnecessary loss of experienceand expertise.Mr. President, this amendment is unwise and imprudent. It would compromiseour capability, impose intollerable demands on our men and women in uniform.I urge its rejection.[S13MY8-307]{S5713}COHENMr. COHEN. I thank the Senator from yielding back his time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.[S13MY8-308]{S5713}COHENMr. COHEN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.[S13MY8-309]{S5713}COCHRANMr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Mainefor yielding to me.Let me make four points in opposition to the Kennedy amendment. First ofall, it would be an unprecedented procedure to call upon the Congress tosingle out a certain kind of ship and impose, by law, a cap on the numberof ships that can be deployed. The Congress is very much involved in helpingmake decisions about the number of ships that are funded in the appropriationscycle and that are authorized as we review from time to time the needsof the military. But never has the Congress attempted to assert its authorityto participate in these decisions by mandating by law a certain numberof ships of one kind that can be deployed.We are injecting ourselves, if we adopt this amendment, into a new levelof management decision that ought to be left to the Navy and not usurpedby the Congress.The second point I would like to make is that if we adopt this amendment,we are tying the hands of the managers of the military for scheduling,for deciding how many ships can be out of the fleet for overhaul, for refueling;this could be a very serious impediment to the carrying out of the missionof our Navy.Here is why: When the <T3>Enterprise</T3> was built some 27 years ago, plans were made for refuelingthat have not yet been implemented. The <T3>Enterprise</T3> is due to go into a yard for a period of almost 30months for recoring, for complete dismantling.In a consecutive plan schedule, each of the other nuclear-powered carrierswill be sent into yards for refueling for extended stays when they willbe incapable of deployment in the event of an emergency or for any otherpurpose.This, in effect, is going to reduce the number of aircraft carriers thatour Navy managers have available to them to 13 by 1991. If we adopt thisKennedy amendment, we are going to put a legal cap on the ability of ourNavy managers to keep our ships deployed to fulfill their mission. Thisis going to jeopardize the Navy in a very serious way, Mr. President.I urge the Senate to look carefully at the practical effect of this amendmentupon the management and scheduling of the fleet in view of the requirementsfor overhauls and nuclear refueling.My third point relates to the retention of naval personnel. The Senatorfrom Ohio, Senator <T4>Glenn,</T4> and the Senator from Virginia, Senator <T4>Trible,</T4> have mentioned the adverse effect that capping the fleetat this level would have on sailors and pilots assigned to our aircraftcarriers.I can recall being in the Arabian Sea on the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>at the time our hostages were being held in Iran. TheEmbassy in Iran had been captured, in effect, by the Iranians, and we haddeployed aircraft carriers to that region. The <T3>Nimitz </T3>was there; the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>was there.I can remember talking to one of our Marine Corps captains who was a piloton the <T3>Coral Sea</T3>. He was dedicated. He was glad to be there because itgave him extra flying time. He really enjoyed being out there on that aircraftcarrier awaiting the signal to be launched because it gave him a greaterlikelihood of flying time under those circumstances. That is the kind ofmorale he had.He expressed to me, however, his concern that, with the cutbacks in allowances,with the threat to military pay, with living conditions back home for hiswife and child, he might not be able to reenlist, and he was really dreadinghaving to make that decision.My point is that if we require those young men to continue staying in thoseon-station positions for periods of time exceeding the 6 months now required_whichwill be the effect if we adopt this amendment_we do a disservice to thepeople who are sacrificing to protect our Nation's security. Are we goingto ask them to stay longer than 6 months, to stay out on station for ayear or more? That would be the effect of this amendment, Mr. President.I hope the Senate will look at such practical consequences.My fourth and final point is simply that the 15 battle groups that we haveplanned for the Navy right now are the minimum number needed. If we werein a national emergency, there would be a request from the Joint Chiefsthat we enlarge that commitment. If this amendment were law, we would haveto stop and change the law to permit an expansion of our fleet to copewith the emergency.We are talking, therefore, about a minimum peacetime force of 15 battlegroups. If this amendment were adopted, we would cut that back even further.This would be an unwise step, Mr. President, and I hope the Senate willlook carefully before it votes to approve the Kennedy amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-310]{S5713}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield 5 minutes to the chairman of the ArmedServices Committee, Senator <T4>Nunn.</T4>The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are going to vote on the Kennedy amendment first and thenthe Wallop amendment at about 5 after 12.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless time is yielded back.[S13MY8-313]{S5713}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.There are serious problems in Navy aviation, and I think some of thoseproblems are self-imposed by the Navy by the way they have allocated theirbudget.Last year the Navy decided to accelerate by 5 years the procurement oftwo aircraft carriers, but they cut out 30 percent of their combat aircraftin their plan. That creates an imbalanced Navy. That is what we are talkingabout now. We are not talking about a debate on the philosophy of a 600-shipNavy, or the question of the philosophy about how many aircraft carrierswe need in the world, or what our national military strategy is. Maybethose debates should take place, but that is not what we are talking aboutnow.We are talking about whether we are going to have a balanced Navy or whetherwe are going to have an imbalanced Navy. That is what this debate is about.The Navy is seriously short of combat aircraft, between 150 and 200 combataircraft. The shortages have forced the Navy already to disestablish the14th Carrier Air Wing this spring. Now they are going to have 13 activeand 2 Reserve wings. We are really talking about whether we in this bodygo ahead and accept and ask the Navy to accept the inevitable, and thatis, they have become so wrapped up in the so-called 600-ship Navy thatthey are creating an imbalanced force. That is what we are here about,and that is what the debate is about. It is not a question of a 600-shipNavy.The question is whether we are going to have 600 ships out there that canoperate, that are capable of carrying out this mission, that are equippedand armed and have the spare parts and have the capability to perform theirfunction. That is what we are talking about.It is not going to do us much good to force through a 15-carrier conceptand then not have the planes, the ammunition, the spare parts, or the trainedpersonnel to really operate those. We are going to see a shift in the next5 years from the concept which we had in the late 1970's when General Meyerdescribed the Army as a hollow army. We are going to see that same thinghappen again. We are going to be talking about a hollow navy within thenext 3 years.It is apparent now, and the question is whether we get out in front ofit or we wait and get the situation to crisis proportions and then facereality.Mr. President, we now have more carriers than we did in the 1970's, sothe operating demand on the carriers has been lessened. Maintaining ourcurrent 14-carrier force level is what Senator<T4> Kennedy</T4> is talking about. We are not talking about cutting whatwe have out there now. We are talking about restraining the growth thatis planned. We are talking about keeping what we have now rather than goingto 15 carriers.We had this debate in committee. Senator<T4> Kennedy</T4>'s side, which I voted with, lost that vote on a closevote, but I think it is time for the whole Senate to think about it today.Senator<T4> Kennedy</T4>'s amendment does not reduce carrier force levels. Itsimply delays the increase from 14 to 15 carriers by 7 years.Now, I would like to have 15 carriers fully equipped, properly manned withthe modern combat aircraft that we need, but it does not appear possiblewithin the budget that we now have agreed to by the executive branch andthe Congress.The Navy now has shortages of surface combatants, aircraft and munitions.The Navy's force is not in balance now and is going to get more imbalancedas we move along. We are in a period of severe budget constraints, andI think it is imperative that we make the tough decisions now.Mr. President, we are really deciding whether the Senate is going to takethis step at this point on the authorization bill or whether the AppropriationsCommittee is going to probably have to take this step before this yearis over, or at least early next year, or whether the Navy itself will takethis step down the road.So we are really, I think, out in front of a problem, and I congratulatethe Senator from Massachusetts. The last thing we need is an imbalancedand hollow Navy.Back in the old days the Greeks had what they called triremes and biremes.These were ships that used underwater rams to ram the other ship, and itwas rather effective in that day and time.Later on we then moved to what we called juggernauts. These were shipsthat got out and rammed others.Now, we do not want to see aircraft carriers out there that do not havethe personnel, do not have the planes, do not have the modern aircraftand munitions and turn them into juggernauts and rams where all they cando is run around the oceans of the world trying to find some ship and ramit.Now, I will admit that an aircraft carrier used as a ram would be darnedeffective if it found that ship, chased it down, and went over it becauseit would have awesome mass and power. But that is not what an aircraftcarrier does. An aircraft carrier is a landing field. An aircraft carrieronly has the striking power that is possessed in its aircraft. What weare now doing is building ships that will not have the striking power becausewe will not be able to furnish the aircraft.So I hope that the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts would beagreed to, and I repeat, if it is not agreed to now, what we are goingto look back on in 2 years, if not sooner, is the fact that the Senatorfrom Massachusetts told us what is happening; he has told us correctly.He has given us a chance to make a good decision now to be able to putthe money in the Navy where it needs to be and to be able to prevent thekind of imbalance that is now apparent and inevitable.Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time I have.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-314]{S5714}COHENMr. COHEN. May I inquire, how much time do I have remaining?The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes for the proponents, 7 minutesfor the opponents.[S13MY8-315]{S5714}COHENMr. COHEN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.[S13MY8-316]{S5714}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Thank you, Mr. President.As the distinguished chairman of the committee leaves the floor, I wouldlike to remind him that there is a significant difference between a juggernautand a dreadnought. The dreadnought was a ship; the juggernaut was a cartcontaining idols. If the distinguished chairman knows of any time a juggernautwent to sea, I would be glad to try to revise naval history in whateverfashion we can.Mr. President, with deep regret I note the time restraints, and I wouldlike to inform my distinguished friend from Illinois this is the last timeI am agreeing to a time agreement on an issue of this gravity. There isa lot of misinformation that has been brought forth by the proponents ofthis amendment. There is a great deal of information that needs to be broughtout. We are talking about the future of this Nation's ability to defendits vital national security interests throughout the world. Anybody whobelieves that this amendment is some kind of cosmetic change in carrierforce levels does not understand that the backbone of our maritime strategyis naval task forces, and the essential element of these task forces isthe aircraft carrier.It is interesting to me that the chairman, and the distinguished subcommitteechairman from Massachusetts, have such a degree of omniscience about whatthe Navy needs. It is also interesting that their vision is in direct contradictionto what the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CNO of the Navy,the entire membership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense,and every knowledgeable expert that I know of feels are this Nation's vitalnational security requirements.I think it is a shame that we are bringing up an amendment that is crucialto the future of this country, and our naval forces, in this fashion andwithout time for adequate debate. Most of the amendments we are discussing in this year's authorization billaffect small issues, or forces whose impact will be felt far in the future.The Kennedy-Levin amendment appears to call for small changes in our Navy,but that is not its real purpose. It has been clear ever since Senator<T4>Kennedy</T4> first raised these ideas that this amendment is designedas the prelude to major changes in our force posture: It claims to seek ``balance'' in the Navy's force structure, in fact, itis designed to lead to an eventual cut in our naval forces equal to twocarrier task groups. It will affect our ability to meet our commitments all over the world.It will affect our ability to deal with sudden and unexpected contingencieslike the defense of the gulf. It will affect our basic war fighting capabilities. It will affect the men and women of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps whoare in our All-Volunteer Force. These are the men and women who are expectingto spend, as we did in 1980, as long as 240 days at sea without respite.I wish that some of our distinguished staff members who have advocatedthis proposal could have the opportunity of spending a few months at seaon an aircraft carrier. I believe that they would then become profoundadvocates of certainly an increase of more than 15 carrier battle groups.Let's be frank, if this bill really meant what it appears to mean, it wouldbe just as pointless as it appears to be. It would not result in any meaningful improvement in readiness. It would not produce any real savings, just paper changes in the budgetwhich substitute new costs like those for pilot retention for older costs.It would not improve the Navy's balance. It would be just another gratuitous interference in the planning of theDepartment of Defense, another exercise in micromanagement. It would randomly interfere in the pattern of hard-fought tradeoffs theNavy has made in readiness, ship numbers, aircraft numbers, and modernization.It would ignore the fact the committee called for the Navy to provide thekind of far more substantive and meaningful analysis of the Navy's airrequirements in its reporting language on the Defense Authorization Actthat is necessary to take intelligent decisions. [S13MY8-317]{S5715}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Ford</T4>). Will the Senator from Arizona suspend while the Senatecomes to order. The Senator from Arizona. [S13MY8-318]{S5715}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Thank you, Mr. President. Let me go back to the real point behind this seemingly pointless amendment.The truth is that this bill is intended as a prelude to removing two carriertask groups from service. The issue is not early retirement of the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>and/or the <T3>Midway</T3>. The authors have attempted to disguise this with a cover letter and attachmentthat claim $1 to $5 billion savings that are totally unrelated to the proposalthey make. They have further disguised the reality with an attachment that totallyignores the fact that the definition of deployable carrier includes carriersthat will be out of service for 2 years to 30 months because of SLEP andthe refueling of nuclear carriers. They omit the fact that the CRS, GAO, and CBO studies presented to thepower projection subcommittee showed that the only way to obtain majorsavings was to retire two carriers, additional air wings, and their escortsand to reduce their manpower. If we do anything else, we get only about $150 to $300 million annually.Even these savings are paper savings that only exist if we ignore the incrementalburden placed on the rest of the fleet, manpower retention costs, and thefact we may need the ships. Early retirement of even one carrier means raising the average deploymentat sea from 144 days per year to at least 154. This will place a majorstrain on retention and the true figure could be much higher. When we talk days at sea, we forget it takes time to move to and from station.A carrier that spends 144 days at sea and is sent to the Indian Ocean onlyactually spends 90 days in the place it is sent to fight. It takes 45 daysto move each way, and this kind of 6 month deployment is only planned tooccur once every 18 months. To put this differently, it takes five to six carriers in peacetime tokeep one carrier constantly on duty half way around the world. Further, these savings ignore the fact that the <T3>Coral Sea </T3>is due to make one more deployment before it retiresin 1992, and the <T3>Midway </T3>is due to make five more deployments before it retiresin 1997. The only reason to spend even a moment on this bill, regardless of howit may now be phrased is to begin a process that will lead to major cutsin our Navy. Every Senator who votes today should realize the fact that a vote is notsome petty exercise in micromanagement, it is support of an amendment whosetrue ultimate purpose is major force cuts. If you vote for this amendment, you go on record as supporting the eliminationof two carrier battle groups from our force structure at a time every newscastreminds us just how vital our navy really is.   Any cut in our present naval strength is not a casual event.We have used carriers nearly 200 times since the end of World War II_virtuallyalways to prevent war or to limit its escalation.On roughly 75 of these occasions, we reacted to situations with littleor no intelligence warning.All our war games and studies show we need far more carriers than we currentlyprogram.We already are short one carrier in the Mediterranean because one of thetwo carriers we need is deployed in the Indian Ocean.Not one word in all the testimony before the Power Projection Subcommitteeor Armed Services Committee by the advocates of this bill ever challengedthe need for more carriers than we already plan to deploy.The Joint Chiefs and SACLANT strongly and actively oppose the bill.SACLANT made a particular point of the absurdity of cutting the Navy'sactive carrier force in the Atlantic by 20 percent to save less than 1percent of the Navy's budget.We face a major problem in communicating these needs precisely becausethe Power Projection Committee has not had the benefit of the kind of systematicstudy it needs to address this issue.We need to begin by understanding that the Navy spent months making hardchoices to come to us with its budget recommendations. It knew that carriersare the longest lead item. It knew it could make savings by retiring 16frigates, and by deferring the creation of a 14th active air wing. It knewit had to trade some aspects of its current air strength to fund the modernizationof the F/A-18 and the A-12.Responsible and well thought out tradeoffs were made long before the propositionbefore us.The Navy's minimum goal, assuming we lose no bases and make no new commitments,is 15 deployable aircraft carriers.This term ``deployable,'' however, does not mean fully available for combat.Once we allow for the carriers that will be in SLEP and overhaul, it reallymeans that 13 carriers will be available for immediate combat until 1991.0[S13MY8-319]{S5715}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate? I cannot hear.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that he could not. Otherwisethe Senate will come to order, and give the Senator from Arizona your attention.If not, remove yourselves from the Senate Chamber and to the Cloakrooms.And there will not be another opportunity to call on the Chair in the nexthalf hour for order.[S13MY8-320]{S5715}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Thank you, Mr. President.Beginning in the early 1990's, one carrier will have to spend some 30 monthsin partial disassembly for nuclear refueling. This means 12 carriers willbe immediately available for combat. One of the additional carriers willbe in SLEP, which takes 28 months. The third will be undergoing major overhaul.This means that there will be no shortfall in air wings. We had 12 activeair wings under Carter. We have 13 now. We have had to cut back on plansto create 14 active air wings, but we have 2 reserve air wings, trainingunits, and marine forces.Even if we ignore the fact that we can easily alter the mix of air wingsto suit given missions, we can provide the air strength our carrier forceneeds. The Navy has sufficient aircraft for all its carriers.These facts were ignored in the CBO study to the point that it set a requirementso high that it called for 180 more aircraft than the Navy will have deckspotsto deploy.We can provide all the escort force the Navy needs. The Navy may well needenough escorts for 15 carrier battle groups, but it does not need escortsfor carriers in SLEP or nuclear refueling.Further, even in a global conflict, there will be contingencies where themix of escorts can be altered to provide exceptionally strong defense forthe key task groups and others can be given less protection. Further, manyof our allies have escorts, none, have any equivalent to our carriers.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think that would cut down on some of the noise thatwe have around here.The Senator may proceed.[S13MY8-322]{S5716}McCAINMr. <T4>McCAIN. </T4>Mr. President, this amendment is being advocated on thesame kind of basis that if it were applied to our reelection campaigns,would ensure that we all ``cost-effective'' lost office. It is totallydevoid of any concern with our overall military needs. It is product ofpeople who report on the price of everything and the value of nothing.The force data that have been presented in favor of it are mistaken ormeaningless.The cost savings are mythical or will be achieved by gutting a key elementof the fleet.There is no clear reason for the proposed amendment. Regardless of whatis being said here today, there is precious little intent to use any ofthe proposed savings, if any to help improve other aspects of the Navy.This kind of ``help'' is never going to undue the harm it begins with.This amendment is being advocated with sublime indifference to our militaryneeds, and the fact that its real impetus is to try to solve today's Federalbudget problems with solutions that cannot have any real impact for yearsto come.We cannot afford to play around with our force structure without plans,without net assessments, without requirements analyses, and in sheer indifferenceto every aspect of our military planning. Accounts may make superb accountants,but they are not superb admirals.I agree that the day of meaningless slogans like a ``600 ship Navy'' isover. I agree with Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>and Senator <T4>Levin </T4>that the time has come to insist that our budgets presentour military needs in net assessment terms, and show why given force mixesare necessary to meet given strategic commitments and the needs of givenunified and specified commands.But, we have taken steps to insist on these reforms beginning in the fiscalyear 1990 budget, we have<ITAG tagnum="80">insisted that the Navy fully report on its air modernization plansby December. </ITAG>We need to wait for these studies, and we need to take intelligent forcewidedecisions based on the entire FYDP. I can promise my colleagues that ifthey Navy fails to make its case, I will be the first to cut its forces.But, let me say that while cutting the Navy may be a senatorial hobby,defending it is a military profession. I believe that once we are giventhe kind of plan and study we really need to take intelligent decisions,the last thing we will cut is the strength of our carrier forces.In the interim, this amendment is precisely how this body should not takedecisions on defense. It is worse than pointless micromanagement, it isa real threat to our security. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts has 9 minutes remaining. [S13MY8-323]{S5716}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.[S13MY8-324]{S5716}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. I am opposed to the Kennedy amendment. First, the Navy's goal is ``15 deployable aircraft carriers''. The Navycurrently has 14 carriers and 13 air wings. This will grow to 15 carriersand remain at 13 air wings in 1990, when the carrier <T3>Lincoln </T3>is commissioned. Mr. President, the Navy had 13 carriers and 12 active air wings duringthe Carter years. This increased to 13 during the Reagan administration.Navy decided against expanding to 14 in preparation for delivery of thecarrier <T3>Lincoln </T3>in fiscal 1990, due to fiscal constraints. The numberof Naval Reserve air wings, however, will remain constant, at two. Second, Mr. President, the number of aircraft carriers we need is drivenby our international commitments. In the Pacific Fleet alone, the requirementto continuously station one carrier in the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea requiresfive aircraft carriers. The Indian Ocean commitment would occupy six Pacific Fleet carriers, excepttransit time is less for the <T3>Midway, </T3>which is homeported in Japan, and because one carrierfrom the Atlantic Fleet is allocated to the Indian Ocean mission. Also, unplanned requirements for surge deployments in response to crisesshould be kept in mind. Over the years, the aircraft carriers have been a very important tool providingstrength in support of U.S. diplomacy, deterring aggression, and counteringstate-sponsored terrorism. Carriers have also been used in response to Third World contingencies involvingLibya, Lebanon, and Grenada. Both Secretary Carlucci and Admiral Crowehave stated that 15 carriers is a minimum requirement. The Kennedy amendment would reduce the number of carriers available inthe 1990's for normal deployment to 12, the lowest number ever. The lasttime we had only 12 was during 1977-83. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. [S13MY8-325]{S5716}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield 3 minutes to the Senatorfrom Maine, and then I will take 5 minutes to wrap up, and we are preparedto vote if that is agreeable.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has yielded 3 minutesto the Senator from Maine. The Senator from Maine has 3 minutes.[S13MY8-326]{S5716}COHENMr. COHEN. Mr. President, I find curious the arguments that are being madehere on this floor. First, Congress cuts the budget for aircraft procurement,and then we turn around and argue we do not have enough aircraft to justifythe construction of aircraft carriers. That is a curious way of formulatingforeign policy and defense policy through the budgetary process. We talkedabout why we do not have enough aircraft to put on the ships. It takes7 years to build an aircraft carrier. You can build a plane and train peoplein a lot shorter period of time. The fact is that we are an island nation,and that the one area that we have retained any margin of superiority historicallyhas been through the projection of sea power.I listened, as a member of the Armed Services Committee over the years,to those who say we still maintain this thin margin of superiority. TheSenator from Massachusetts points with pride to the fact that we do nothave any more areas today than we had in 1981 to defend. There is no greaterarea of responsibility to cover than in 1981. I recall that it was in 1981when, for the first time, the CNO, Admiral Hayward, came before the SenateArmed Services Committee and said, ``We no longer have a margin of superiorityin a time of conflict. I would have to say the outcome is muddy.'' Thatwas a shocking statement to those of us who sat on the committee in 1981.We had a hollow Navy and a hollow Army. We are now proposing perhaps amidget Navy in terms of cutting it back.What has not been discussed here today is that in 1991 we will be pullingships out of deployment because we have to recore them. Their nuclear energysource has to be refueled. That will take almost 30 months.<ITAG tagnum="80">We are now down not to 14 ships but to 13 and possibly 12 aircraftcarriers in the 1990's. Also we are about to have an amendment at leastdiscussed, if not accepted, here today about deploying our ships for moredrug interdiction. Now we are putting more and more burdens on our Navy,and we are cutting back on the ability to carry out the missions that wehave imposed on them.</ITAG>In my judgment, Mr. President, we are looking at a new form of isolationism,a Fortress America by another name. There are some Presidential candidateswho want to reduce our presence around the world. Some would like to pulltroops out of Europe, others would like to pull troops out of South Korea.We had that several years ago with a proposal to unilaterally reduce ourpresence in South Korea. Some would like to pull troops out of the PersianGulf. That is a policy debate that will be decided between now and Novemberduring the Presidential elections.Those who advocate that may believe that we can project the moral forceof our ideals at the same time they restrict our ability to defend withmilitary power the force of those moral ideals. That is a choice that willbe made in November. But I think, Mr. President, we have to overwhelminglyreject the attempt to formulate policy and to cut back on our commitments,not by addressing the President saying we want our troops out of Korea,out of Europe, out of the Atlantic, out of the Pacific, or out of the PersianGulf. We do not do that. We back track. We rejected that approach. I thinkwe have an obligation to our men and women, to American self-governmentto take such action. Let Congress tell the Navy it should not defend theMiddle East.But do not do this to our young men and women who are serving in the Navy.Do not impose upon them additional responsibilities. Do not ask them toserve longer and longer periods of time, working harder and harder, havingless time at their home with their families, and then ask them to reinlist.We are doing a terrible disservice to the men and women who serve in ourNavy. For less than one-half of 1 percent of the Navy's budget, we aregoing to reduce the Atlantic fleet's deployable carrier forces by 20 percent.That is Admiral Baggett's testimony. Do not accept this amendment.I urge the Chamber at the appropriate time to table this amendment.[S13MY8-327]{S5717}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes. The clock is running.[S13MY8-328]{S5717}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think it is important that as we are comingclose to the vote to consider what this amendment does and what this amendmentdoes not do. First of all, as a result of this amendment, if it is accepted,we will be building more naval ships, more naval planes, and increasingthe capacity of our Navy to have more munitions. That is the point of thisamendment. The savings, which have been estimated by CBO and GAO, are between$1 billion and $5 billion. That money would be used to build the U.S. Navy.This is point No. 1.Point No. 2, Mr. President, is that this amendment would effectively maintainthe status quo in terms of aircraft carrier force levels until 1997. When our global responsibilities increased in 1980-81 as the result ofthe invasion of Afghanistan and other events in the Persian Gulf, we had12 carriers and no battleships. Now, we have 14 carriers and 4 battleships.Mr. President, we hear about the time on station and the time off station.I have the data on that: each carrier was away from homeport an averageof 163 days in 1980; 172 days in 1981; 155 in 1982; 154 in 1983; 159 in1984; 134 in 1985; 122 in 1986; 133 in 1987. That is the time on station.When Senators talk about years and years of time on station, they are atvariance with the facts. There has been reduction in time on station by20 days, as the newer aircraft carriers have joined the fleet over thepast 7 years.We understand the hardship that goes on, but the fact is that that hardshipis going to be transferred, unless we accept this amendment, to those sailorson cruisers and destroyers, because that is where the shortfalls are.I do not know why we cry crocodile tears for the shortfalls and burdenon the aircraft carriers when you have someone a mile off your starboardwhose families will be disrupted as well. Mr. President, as the chairmanof the committee has said so well, the shortfall in terms of naval surfaceships, munitions, and planes is where the attention should be.The argument that has been made here that we cannot challenge the Navy'sjudgment would remove our constitutional responsibility for raising armiesand navies. We have an authorizing committee and an appropriating committee,and we have an obligation to make the difficult judgments on how to allocatethe scarce resources.Mr. President, I hope that those who believe, as the chairman has pointedout, in a balanced Navy, those who are concerned about ensuring that weare going to be able to keep our commitments, those who are concerned aboutallocating resources in the most effective way will support our amendment.Finally, Mr. President, this issue has been studied and restudied. Thesuggestion that it has not been studied really does not hold water. Wehave reports from the General Accounting Office, from the Department ofDefense, and from the CBO. I think a fair review of those reports wouldsubstantiate those of us who support this amendment.I hope the motion to table will be rejected, and I ask for the yeas andnays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?There is a sufficient second.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S13MY8-329]{S5717}CHILESMr. CHILES. Mr. President, as a body we have supported the modernizationand expansion of our Navy. The value of what has been achieved by thatNavy is well-known. Operations in the Persian Gulf, Libya, and elsewherehave shown the continuing need for and value of the mobile projection forcerepresented by the carrier battle group and the battleship action group.The need for those forces will in my estimation continue. I think thatthere is a broad consensus on this. We must, therefore, insure we retaina balanced and capable carrier capability.I share the concern of Senator <T4>Kennedy </T4>and others about the future cost of our Navy. We haveserious resource problems which we must address in the continuing modernizationand support of the planes and ships and tanks and most importantly thepersonnel in all our Armed Forces. The gains of the past 10 years mustbe made sustainable. We must have a plan to keep what we have running andmodern. As Secretary Carlucci has repeatedly testified we cannot returnto a hollow force.Just as real is the fact that hard tradeoffs must be made if we are toget our fiscal house in order. I think that acting now, in a budget amendmentto determine how to balance the Navy's composition within the probableconstrained dollars is inappropriate. I strongly agree, however, that itmust be done.The current amendment attempts to force the reconsideration by specificallyremoving carrier capability. We must recognize that the action will notmaintain a status quo. The remaining carriers will absorb new operationalresponsibilities because of the planned refueling and recoring of our nuclearcarriers_an additional required maintenance job that may take up to 30months per vessel. Fewer available carriers mean we either commit the carriersless or run them and the sailors who man them harder. I don't think wecan afford either course.There is a far better mechanism to achieve a balanced affordable Navy.Secretary Carlucci has gone to the services and asked them to make thechoices in DOD's planning process. We will have the opportunity to reviewthose decisions in the new biennial budget we receive from the Department.The Navy should and I think must propose the balanced affordable forcewe need.[S13MY8-330]{S5717}COHENMr. COHEN.

The Senator from Arizona.[S13MY8-361]{S5719}McCAINMr. M<T4>c</T4>CAIN. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to by bothsides. Since I know there is heavy business before the Senate, I will bebrief in my description of this amendment and I am pleased that my friendand colleague from Illinois, Senator <T4>Dixon, </T4>and others have agreed to it.Mr. President, this bill concerns the size of Japan's contributions, notonly to our common defense but to development of other economies throughoutthe world. Last year, I proposed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution whichwas accepted by this body. This resolution called upon the Japanese toincrease their economic contributions, not only in the Pacific rim butthroughout the world. It called for Japan to stop its excuses and evasionsand to share at least as much of the burden of preserving security as theaverage effort by our NATO allies.Since last year, Mr. President, the Japanese Government has made very little,if any, effort to pick up its share of that burden. I think it is importantto recognize, Mr. President, that Japan's total defense effort and economicassistance programs reach only one-fourth the amount, as a percent of GNP,of the average effort of our European allies. We do not need to talk aboutthe NATO burden-sharing problem as long as we have the Japanese burden-sharingproblem. Japan's efforts do not come close to those of any other majorally, much less survive in comparison to the efforts of the United States.Mr. President, our ships that are protecting the tankers and cargo shipsin the gulf are experiencing enormous strain, and require enormous expenseon the part of the U.S. taxpayers. Sixty percent of that oil that now flowsthrough the Persian Gulf now goes to Japan. When last I checked the Japanesewere not paying one penny for that enormous protection and sacrifice onthe part of the American people. They made a token payment toward an improvednavigation system, but this compares to the sale of over $100 million invehicles and supplies that went directly to the Iranian military. Theyspent less than one-tenth of the money on preserving security and end theIran-Iraq war they earned from keeping the war going.Mr. President, this amendment calls for a report to the Congress of theUnited States that describes the amount and nature of Japanese overseasdevelopment assistance by recipients, including distinguishing betweengrant aid loans and credits.It calls on the Japanese to enter into discussions with our Governmentto bring up their contribution over time, by 1992, so that will approximatethe average of the levels of spending by the member nations of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization on official development assistance and developmentprograms as a percentage of their respective gross national products. Itcalls for an end to excuses and evasion, and it calls for Japan to actas a responsible nation.Mr. President, Japanese failure to share the burden of defending the freeworld is a source of great dissatisfaction and even anger on the part ofthe American people. I want to point out very clearly, however, that itis in no one's interest, including the Japanese people's, for Japan toremilitarize. I do not suggest or support a significant remilitarizationof the Japanese nation. What I do strongly suggest is that it is time thatJapan took its place as a major economic power in the world, and extendthe kind of economic assistance to Pacific rim countries, Africa, LatinAmerica, and other nations that is vital to preserving our mutual security.Japan's mission should be to provide the development assistance that thesenations so badly need and to further the cause of democracy and freedomthroughout the world.Mr. President, if Japan does not act, and act dramatically and decisivelywithin the next year, I intend to introduce legislation that will for suchaction, and I believe that a strong majority in both Houses will supportme, Japan is the proper focus of our efforts in burden sharing. It is thenation which must begin to use its wealth responsibly and for the commongood. The time for words is over. The time for action is long over due.I would like to express my appreciation to my good friend from Illinoisin supporting this amendment and I have no further comments. I yield theremainder of my time.[S13MY8-362]{S5719}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished Senator fromArizona for his usual thoughtfulness. His amendment follows up a similaramendment he offered last year. It represents a balanced, reasonable effortto encourage Japan to expand further its growing foreign aid program andwe are delighted to support this on the majority side.[S13MY8-363]{S5719}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of this importantamendment.I happen to have had the opportunity over the past year to do a great dealof traveling around this country. And one concern I heard expressed many,many times was that some of our allies are just not doing enough to beartheir fair share of the burdens and risks of defending the free world.And let me say very candidly: some of the most serious concerns are expressedabout Japan. Japan spends less on its own defense than any other majorindustrialized country, just over 1 percent. Yet it could and should doso much more. It enjoys an almost unprecedented economic growth and prosperity;it maintains an enormous trade surplus, not only with the United Statesbut with practically everybody else. It has done far less, proportionally,than we and several of our NATO allies have in the Persian Gulf_yet itprobably receives more concrete benefit from maintaining freedom of navigationin the gulf than any other allied nation.It is time_high time; for Japan to do more_much more.The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator<T4>McCain, </T4>is an important step in focusing attention, and effectiveaction, on this key problem.We need to keep clearly in mind our basic goal: to reach the point whereJapan is bearing the same degree of combined defense-foreign aid burdenthat we bear. The McCain amendment precisely sets that as our policy goal_ina way that Tokyo can't ignore or duck.We need to know exactly what Japan is doing; what it is capable of andshould be doing; and what we are doing to pressure Japan to close thatburden-sharing gap. The report mandated by the McCain amendment will giveus the hard facts we need, to act rationally and effectively to do whatneeds to be done to get Japan to pony up its fair share.In recent months, I have offered some ideas for Japanese burden-sharing,including those suggested in the McCain amendment in the field of economicaid. I would also like to see Japan make a major_the major_contributionto an alliance oil reserve, to reduce our dependence on gulf and MiddleEast oil. I would like Japan to bear a greater share of the cost of ourmilitary operations, both in Japan and in the region. Others, undoubtedly,have their own ideas.But it is time_as I said, high time_to start turning these ideas into action.Let's start today by agreeing to the McCain amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have cleared this with the majority side,and I think with the minority side. It is a very simple sense-of-the-Senateamendment. It simply says that the Base Closing Commission which we haveagreed to set up, in filing their report and making their determinations,will take into consideration the economic impact that a recommended baseclosing might possibly have on the community.For example, I have a base in my State where the unemployment rate in thesurrounding community is 16 percent. If you close the air base there, theunemployment rate immediately shoots to 24 percent.My point is this: The Commission should not make a recommendation solelyon the basis of cost savings to the Defense Department. They should alsohave the costs to the U.S. Government and the country as a whole in unemploymentcompensation, food stamps, all kinds of social programs that will resultfrom a whopping increase in the unemployment rate.This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment telling them to please take thatinto consideration.No. 2, and this is not really critical, but there may be instances in whichthe Pentagon will want to brief the Base Closing Commission on the factthat there are some geographical or maybe other considerations for a base'sexistence, based on certain compartmented programs or so-called black programsthat are ultrasecret.I assume the Pentagon and the Defense Department will not want to, andthis amendment does not even suggest that they clue the Base Commissionin on every sort of code word secret that we have in the United States.But there are some cases where highly sensitive operations are taking placeat some bases. While it may look on the surface to be highly inefficient,from an economic standpoint, and not cost effective to the Defense Department,there is still the possibility that there is a justification on that basedon ultrasecret black programs that are taking place at that base.So all we are saying is those two things should be considered by the Commission.I appreciate very much the cooperation of the distinguished Senator fromIllinois in reviewing this and bringing it to clear it on our side.[S13MY8-373]{S5720}DIXONMr. DIXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe that this amendment is acceptable tothe managers of the bill so I will be brief. There are just a few pointsthat need to be made.I want to begin by commending the committee in general and Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> and Senator <T4>Exon</T4> in particular for focusing on the problem of the wastes generatedby defense activities. For too long we have ignored this problem, not justat Hanford, but at other DOE sites around the country. And, as a result,our environment has been contaminated and our citizens have been threatened.It is, at the least, ironic that activities designed to protect our peoplehave, in fact, placed them in danger. The committee has increased fundingfor programs designed to clean up the waste that has been generated bythe Department of Energy's nuclear weapons facilities. And I am gratefulfor that. But the proposed increase, as the committee recognized, doesnot even begin to deal with the scope of the problem we face.In addition to the national problems we face, as the committee knows, wehave a unique problem in Washington State. The Hanford nuclear reservation,which has been operating for over 40 years as a mainstay of our defenseproduction system, faces a series of serious environmental problems. Wehave accumulated more defense wastes at Hanford than any other facilityin the United States. Even worse, much of that waste is stored in singleshelled tanks which have leaked into the environment. Despite these problems,the general schedule for cleanup, as well as the specific schedule forindividual projects, has slipped badly. The recent decision by the Departmentof Energy to close the N-reactor at Hanford has created fears in the mindsof many that the Government would attempt to simply walk away from thisproblem. I want to acknowledge the very clear statement in the committee'sreport that this is not the case and that the N-reactor decision does notdiminish the Federal Government's obligation to deal with the nuclear wasteproblem and express my appreciation for the committee's forthright statementon this point.The Governors of Washington and Oregon have joined together in an effortto increase funding for defense waste cleanup at Hanford and get the programback on schedule. This amendment is a step in that process. Specifically,the amendment increases the authorized funding level for a number of specificprojects and programs at Hanford. This increase in funding will serve toaccelerate the cleanup and it will also serve to minimize the <ITAG tagnum="80">economic impact on the tricities of DOE's decision to close the N-reactor.</ITAG>Given the tight budgetary constraints faced by the committee, the increasein funding authorized here is less than we need. And it is less than theGovernors have requested. It is, however, a major step toward acceleratingthe waste cleanup programs at Hanford.In addition, the increase in funding does not represent ``new'' money.Essentially, the amendment authorizes the use of funds which were appropriatedin previous years for N-reactor related activities and which can no longerbe spent because of the closure of that facility. There is, then, an increasein authorization for Hanford cleanup, but not an increase in ``new'' budgetauthority.I greatly appreciate the assistance of Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> and Senator <T4>Exon</T4> and committee staff in helping us craft this amendment. Itwill help us accomplish several immediate goals toward beginning constructionof the vitrification plant, operation of grout facilities, and characterizationand cleanup of hazardous and radioactive wastes at the reservation. Itwill also help us mitigate the economic impact of the shutdown of the N-reactor.As the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees are no doubt aware,the long-term costs of defense waste cleanup at Hanford and the other DOEsites are going to be substantial. We are going to have to commit morethan rhetoric to this problem and we will have to find a way to find away of funding these programs in the years to come. Earlier this year,my colleague in the House, Representative <T4>Don Bonker</T4> and I introduced legislation to establish a trust fundfor the cleanup and long-term management of DOE facilities as one alternativeto the long-term problem of funding the Government's substantial obligationin this area. I look forward to my colleagues comments and criticisms ofthis legislation, because a way must be found to deal with the long-termfunding needs of the DOE.Finally, Mr. President, I want to extend a special thank you, to the committeestaff in the context; they have been extremely cooperative and helpful.I now want to add a word of thanks to my senior colleague, Senator <T4>Evans</T4>, who I know wants to speak briefly on this amendment aswell. Senator <T4>Evans</T4> and I have worked on this problem together for a long time.It is no secret that we have different views on many issues associatedwith the future of Hanford. And it is no secret that Hanford related issueshave been, and will be, a political issue in our State. Still, on the questionof defense waste cleanup, we have worked together and our staffs have workedtogether. I want to publicly indicate my appreciation to Senator <T4>Evans. </T4>He has been, in all regards, a real coauthor and not justa cosponsor of this amendment.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S13MY8-393]{S5722}EVANSMr. EVANS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from theState of Washington, Senator <T4>Adams,</T4> in proposing an amendment to authorize significantly increasedspending for defense waste cleanup activities at Hanford, WA. The increasedspending is vital to ensure that we continue to move forward aggressivelyto correct what can only be characterized as an unacceptable situation.As my colleague noted, the bulk of the Nation's defense wastes are stored,inadequately, at Hanford. Highly radioactive material is stored in tanksthat are proving incapable of containing it. In some cases, we are noteven certain what kinds of nuclear material are in the tanks.The people of that community deserve better treatment than they currentlyare receiving. For more than 40 years the citizens of the communities surroundingthe Hanford reservation have made a substantial commitment to our nationaldefense effort. All of us are safer today because of the contributionsthey have made. We need to pay them back with more than just empty promises,particularly when we are talking about rectifying a problem that posessignificant health and environmental risks.Senator <T4>Adams</T4> and I have worked closely together on this issue. We bothagree on the need to keep faith with the people in the Hanford area.Throughout the remainder of the year I will be working aggressively tomake sure that the communities surrounding the Hanford reservation aredeveloping an economic base that will provide for increasing economic opportunitiesin the future. That will require an expansion and continuation of activitiesboth within the Hanford reservation and in the private sector.[S13MY8-394]{S5722}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by the two Senatorsfrom the State of Washington. I believe this amendment to be a good amendment.This amendment would authorize the use of funds previously appropriatedfor projects related to the Hanford N-reactor to be used for waste andcleanup activities. It has been cleared on both sides.[S13MY8-395]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.[S13MY8-396]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON.

I urge itsadoption.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.

I am apologetic, Mr. President. The Senator from Nebraska isabsolutely correct, and I am embarrassed if he has not been informed ofthis.This is an attempt by the Senator from Michigan to reduce the SDI fundingby $600 million and spend it on conventional weaponry, such as Apachesand other things.I wonder whether we need further discussion in view of the fact that hasnot been, apparently, adequately cleared on both sides.[S13MY8-402]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON. Can I be advised as to how much time is allotted to the proponentsand the opponents?[S13MY8-403]{S5722}DIXONMr. DIXON.

We had agreed to 40 minutes.I now understand, frankly, perhaps the jurisdictionally interested peoplewere not on the floor at that time, for which I am humble and apologetic.I am delighted to accommodate everybody according to their whims and, particularly,the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.[S13MY8-404]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON.

May I say, I think the remarks of the Senator from Nebraskaare appropriate. I am told, as well, that the Senator from Idaho, Senator<T4>Symms,</T4> has some problems. I am sure it is for the same reasonas the Senator from Nebraska has problems.Again, I humbly apologize, and I wonder whether we can begin, and, in themeantime, we will try to see what we can do about a time limit.[S13MY8-406]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON.

It seems to me that if we start making exceptions right now topreviously agreed to time agreements, then we are going to break down allthe way around. How much time does the Senator from Michigan have, 20 minutes?[S13MY8-409]{S5722}LEVINMr. LEVIN. That was my understanding. I would be happy to accommodate theSenator.[S13MY8-410]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON. In order to accommodate me, could the Senator from Michigan allowme 3 minutes of his 20 minutes in opposition to his amendment? Then wecan hold to the agreement that was made.[S13MY8-411]{S5722}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say to my friend from Nebraska, he has 20 minutes underthe agreement, 20 minutes under the control of the Senator from Nebraska.It was 40 minutes evenly divided.[S13MY8-412]{S5722}EXONMr. EXON.

Mr. President, the unanimous-consent request is that we go toan SDI amendment by the Senator from Michigan, which would involve reducingthe SDI authorized sum by $600 million using the funds to purchase conventionalweaponry, Apache attack helicopters and other things. The request furtheris that there would be 40 minutes on the debate, 20 minutes in the possessionof the distinguished Senator from Michigan, who would allocate his owntime, 20 minutes to be allocated by those in opposition including the distinguishedSenator from Nebraska, the Senator from Idaho, and others, and that theywould divide their 20 minutes and that there would be no amendments tothe amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the unanimous-consent request?It is so ordered.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.[S13MY8-470]{S5724}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.Mr. President, this amendment is being offered in behalf of myself, Senator<T4>Johnston, </T4>Senator <T4>Dixon </T4>and this amendment would reduce the funding for SDI from$4.6 to $4 billion which would leave it slightly ahead of this year's fundinglevel. We would then take that $600 million and apply it to some very essentialconventional defense programs, programs which are underfunded in this committeebill.The one argument that we have heard on this issue is that we have to providethe $4.6 billion in the Senate in order to assure a reasonable fundinglevel in conference, given the fact that the House is significantly belowthis level. I hope we will not adopt this argument. It is very differentfrom last year when the Senate had a larger overall defense number thanthe House. And we were able in the Senate to absorb a higher figure forSDI than we thought might ultimately be justified or ultimately come outof conference.This year we have a fixed overall defense level which both the Senate andthe House are bound to. So this year, if we provide $4.6 billion for SDIto balance a lower figure from the House, we are going to be sacrificingan opportunity in the Senate to fund other programs that we believe aremore important to the security of the United States.That is a sacrifice to our security. It is a needless sacrifice. It isone that we should not make. We in the Senate must assess the importanceof SDI relative to the importance of other programs. We cannot run awayfrom that prioritization or that assessment.I am convinced that if we do that, we will conclude that the $4 billion,which is what would be left after this amendment, is a generous fundinglevel for SDI, indeed.The President's request for SDI constituted a 28-percent increase overlast year's level. The $4.6 billion recommended by our committee stillgrants the DOD portion of SDI a 21.7-percent increase over last year'slevel. That is a very high priority for SDI, given the fact that we arecutting a number of critical conventional programs, programs which thisamendment would restore. And by the way, this huge increase in the SDIbudget of 21 percent in the committee bill contrasts very dramaticallyto how other research and development programs are faring in the budget.This Randamp;D program of the three military services actually was reducedin the budget. There is actually an aggregate reduction for the three servicesfor research and development at the same time that this bill provides ahuge increase, a 21-percent increase in the SDI program.We know what the return is on the research and development investment inthe three military services. Even the Pentagon and its own Soviet militarypower publication acknowledges that we lead the Soviet Union in the levelof technology in deployed weapons in 15 categories and trail in only 6.So the more funds that we provide this year for SDI, the bigger and thefaster that program is going to bite into funds of the other services inthe future.We recently learned from testimony before a House subcommittee that theSDI program between this year and 1994 is going to require $45 billionjust to help us determine whether we should proceed to full-scale engineeringdevelopment_over $45 billion in the next five Defense budgets for SDI justto be able to decide whether we want to enter full-scale engineering developmentof a phase 1 system which would in turn cost, it is estimated, $150 billionto deploy. With all of the budgetary pressures that we are going to face in the foreseeablefuture, where is all of that money going to come from? It is going to comefrom other defense programs which address real military threats to oursecurity, threats like the armor threat, threats like the submarine threat,theats that require us to be able to effectively project and sustain ourmilitary power in regions where we have few standing forces like the PersianGulf.If we continue to fund SDI as though it were a higher priority than otherimportant programs in the Defense budget, SDI is increasingly going todisplace other important military programs in the budgets of tomorrow.Mr. President, I indicated that it would take according to the DOD estimates$45 billion over the next 5 years just to give us enough information sowe can decide whether 5 years from now we want to lay out another $150billion for a phase 1 defense. What is that defense going to do? What isthe military mission of phase 1? It is not to make nuclear weapons obsolete.It is not to give us a peace shield for our people in our Nation. It isnot even to provide an effective defense of our military forces againsta Soviet nuclear attack.The military mission of the $150 billion phase 1 SDI deployment is ``tocomplicate Soviet attack planning.'' In other words, it is to shoot downjust enough Soviet warheads to complicate a nuclear attack upon our strategicforces. Well, Mr. President, the planning of a nuclear attack is overwhelminglycomplicated already.We now have roughly 3,700 surviving warheads with which to retaliate againsta surprise attack, and roughly 8,200 surviving warheads with which to respondif we were attacked after our forces were alerted.In other words, an attack on us is clearly already totally suicidal, andyou cannot get more suicidal than suicidal.Our nuclear forces are so redundant and so diverse that an attack on usnow is more than complicated. It is a totally irrational and insane act.But if one believes that we must make major new investments in furthercomplicating Soviet attack planning, thus short shrifting our conventionalforces in the process, let me sugget that there are better ways to achievethat goal at a lot less money.I do not think Midgetman is worth the money, but at an estimated $35 millionto $40 million, it is a bargain compared to phase 1 SDI deployment.It is a lot cheaper to deploy 500 Midgetman missiles than it is to reachthe decision point on full-scale engineering development of SDI phase 1.Midgetman has the benefit of further complicating Soviet attack planningwithout requiring us to break out of the ABM Treaty. Phase 1 SDI deploymentwould complicate our own planning for effective retaliation against anattack, because if we break out of the ABM Treaty the Soviets are boundto do likewise, permitting them to deploy extensive ballistic missile defensesof their own.Enough of why SDI should not receive the 21.7 percent provided by the committeebill. Why should funds be transferred from SDI to conventional programs?Because the possibility that a conventional conflict will escalate to nuclearwar is in large part a function of our conventional capability. Conventionalstrength enhances both nuclear and conventional deterrence, and we shouldstart focusing our attention on our conventional forces, because insufficientconventional strength could result in either conventional or nuclear war.There is another reason to emphasize conventional improvements over thisSDI additional spending. If our conventional forces are recognized as beinghighly trained and well equipped, then adversaries in other parts of theworld may be deterred from damaging our interests.I happen to believe that we are not conventionally weak today. I thinkour forces are highly skilled, well armed, and dedicated. But we also allknow that we have conventional deficiencies that could tempt fate, andthose deficiencies are worsened by wasteful or excessive spending on SDI.Where would the $600 million in savings go? Seventy-five million dollarswould be added to the Army's ammunition account, partially restoring $270million cut from ammunition funding. The President requested a 10-percentcut in ammunition for the Army at the same time he wanted to increase SDIby 28 percent. The Army ammunition funding in this committee bill is thelowest level requested or approved since 1981, in constant dollars.Our commander in chief of Central Command, which includes the Persian Gulf,told the committee that the sustainable shortfalls in his command ``areprimarily in the modernized direct fire and artillery munitions in supportof ground forces.''This amendment also would add $210 million to the depot maintenance accountsof the three services, thus reducing the increases in maintenance backlogsour forces will suffer. Depot maintenance funds pay for the major maintenanceof our major combat equipment. General Hansen, commander of Air Force LogisticsCommand, told us: ``The leverage we provide to Air Force readiness throughdepot repair actions is obvious. I classify it as an absolute must payitem.'' He also told us, ``At the end of this year, we are going to seeairplanes without engines.'' That is where we are heading. We are backto airplanes without engines, sitting, waiting for maintenance in the depotsof this country and abroad.This amendment would add $149 million for the purchase of 12 additionalApache attack helicopters.<ITAG tagnum="80">The committee bill cuts Apache production from last year's level.In our armor-antiarmor hearings, we were told that the Hellfire missilecarried by the Apache is one of our few truly effective antitank weaponsin our arsenal. Given Soviet tank strength, it makes no sense to cut theproduction rate of one of our most deadly antitank systems. The antitankproblem should be addressed_not with rhetoric but with dollars taken fromlesser priorities. </ITAG>This amendment also would add $57.3 million for the purchase of 24,000rockets for the Army's multiple launch rocket system, restoring the currentproduction rate. This multiple launch rocket system is perhaps the bestforce multiplier in the Army. Its addition to the firepower of our artilleryis absolutely tremendous. Given the Soviet emphasis on massive artilleryfirepower, MLRS is essential to our conventional capability.AIM-7 missiles for the Navy are increased by $74.3 million, restoring thefiscal year 1988 production rate. Again, without this amendment, anotherproduction rate of an essential munition is going to be cut. In our hearings,we were repeatedly told that our sustainability situation in terms of air-to-airmissiles is atrocious. The AMRAAM missile, which is the follow-on systemto the AIM-7, has experienced delays, and the Navy states that they areroughly 50 percent below their required stocks of this AIM-7 system. Finally, Mr. President, this amendment would provide an additional $33.8million to restore the fiscal year 1988 production rate of Navy sonobuoys.Sonobuoys are dropped in the water by antisubmarine aircraft to locateand track enemy submarines. The Navy's request for sonobuoy productionfor fiscal year 1989 would not even provide enough to replace the sonobuoysexpended in annual training and peacetime operations. Our war reservesof this system are critically low. Let me recap this list briefly: By voting to fund SDI at about last year'slevel, $4 billion, slightly above last year's level_in other words, reducingthe committee bill by $600 million_we can provide the funding necessaryto restore the fiscal year 1988 production rate of multiple launch rocketsystem rockets, AIM-7 air-to-air missiles, and antisubmarine warfare sonobuoys.But that is not all they are going to do. Funding at about last year'slevel for SDI instead of at the $4.6 billion, would also fund a reductionin our growing maintenance backlogs, partially restore the fiscal year1988 funding of Army ammunition, and increase production of the Apachehelicopter, the finest attack helicopter in the world. That is a tremendouscontribution to conventional capability. This amendment is a beginning in terms of putting our priorities wherethey belong, in a strong and credible and robust conventional defense.To do it, we have to take away from something. The logical place to takeit away from is where there is a huge increase proposed, 21 percent, ina program which has major problems and which is taking us on a totallyunknown road. So I hope that this amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators <T4>Johnston </T4>and <T4>Dixon, </T4>will be adopted, so that we can begin to move our prioritiesto the conventional area, where they more and more belong. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-471]{S5726}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized for3 minutes.[S13MY8-472]{S5726}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin amendment.Mr. President, the original fiscal year 1989 request for SDI was reducedby Secretary Carlucci by $1.7 billion. The committee recommended a furtherreduction of $291 million, to $4.55 billion. The Senator's amendment wouldreduce the funding to $3.95 billion, which is about the level of funding,unadjusted for inflation, that was provided last year.The SDI request supports a research effort balanced between technologybase research and validation experiments, between ground and space basedsystems, and between mature and advanced technologies. The SASC recommendationof $4.55 billion preserves this balanced program, and protects the schedule.The House authorized $3.5 billion for SDI research. Chairman <T4>Aspin</T4> supported this level, rather than his committee recommendation,``as a negotiating maneuver prior to a conference with the Senate'' whichwould result in $3.7 billion for DOD. The proposed amendment thus increasesthe likelihood that the conference outcome for SDI will be less than $3.7billion.Mr. President, the greatest impact of funding at the $3.95 billion levelwould be on planned experiments which are essential to demonstrate conceptfeasibility. The basis for a full scale development decision would be seriouslyjeopardized.The SDI continues to be at the forefront of the Soviet arms control agenda.A delay in the program would undermine our negotiators.Finally, Mr. President, in proposing that SDI funds be transferrd to conventionalprograms, the amendment ignores the fact that $700 million from strategicprograms, including $291 million from the SDI Program, has already beentransferred to conventional programs in the committee recommendation. Iurge my colleagues to reject the amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-473]{S5726}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the appropriate time after the time has expiredunder the unanimous-consent agreement I will move to table the amendmentoffered by the Senator from Michigan.Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan and I came to the Senate together.We are extremely close friends. We sit next to each other on the ArmedServices Committee and generally, by and large, we agree on everythingthat is done in that committee. We agree to such an extent that the Senatorfrom Nebraska, the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, was good enoughto give up some $600 million or $700 million, most of which went to theimportant subcommittee under the control and consideration of the Senatorfrom Michigan.And so it has been evident in the Armed Services Committee that this Senatorand others have recognized the need to take some of the funding from theSDI Program and present it to other<ITAG tagnum="80">conventional systems that we thought had a higher priority.</ITAG> Mr. President, I cannot disagree with any of the recommendations that theSenator from Michigan is saying we should fund by taking money away fromthe strategic defense initiative. I point out that the Senator from Michigandid not offer this amendment in the Armed Services Committee for the goodand logical reason, I think, that had he offered it in the Armed ServicesCommittee, it would not have prevailed, but that is my supposition. I thinkthat most of the members of the Armed Services Committee agree with thatoutcome.  He is trying to offer this amendment on the floor of the Senate and frommany standpoints it makes an awful lot of sense. I would head this onceagain under the do-gooder amendment category. Who can oppose providingmony for the poor and the indigent? In this case it is not the poor andthe indigent, but it is some very important programs wtih regard to conventionaldefense that probably are not getting as much funding as even this Senatorwould like.  This do-gooder amendment is not significantly different, Mr. President,from an amendment that was offered by the Senator from Louisiana a fewdays ago, only in that case the attack was being made on the StrategicDefense Initiative Program and the money was being transfered to the spaceshuttle program.  This is a similar amendment but in this case there has been another worthycause under the do-gooder category that is valid by my friend from Michigan. I simply say that if this amendment were adopted, which I hope it willnot be, we would find ourselves in exactly the same position that thisSenator went into considerable argument against 2 days ago when a similaramendment was offered by my friend and colleague from Louisiana.  For the record, Mr. President, I will not read all of it_I may read partsof it_but for the record I ask unanimous consent to have printed at theconclusion of my remarks under this part of the debate and have reprintedfrom the <T4>Congressional Record </T4>of May 11 under page S 5429 with the statement``The Presiding Officer. The Senator from Nebraska.'' It starts out with``Mr. <T4>Exon''</T4> and continue printing from that document over on page S5430 to and through the top paragraph on the second page of that page concludingwith the statement ``wise at this particular juncture?''  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (See exhibit 1.)[S13MY8-475]{S5727}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, if this amendment were adopted, we would be doingthe same thing that I made the argument against in the referenced material.In that material the only thing that you would have to do would be to strikethe words ``the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Wisconsin,''which I referenced on several occasions and insert in this case the nameof the Senator from Michigan. The same basic arguments prevail.In a nutshell those arguments are these: That if this amendment were adoptedto fund these good and worthy projects, we would find ourselves down tothe $3.9 billion figure for SDI funding as far as the Senate is concerned.Recognizing the fact that the House already has significantly slashed SDIspending, we would be locked in conference to somewhere between $3.9 billionif the Levin amendment were adopted and $3.4 billion in the House figure.I would simply say that if history teaches us anything, that would meanthat we would probably end up very likely with a figure somewhere in the$3.6 billion range after we compromised between the House and the Senatefigure.Aside from the worthy goal and the worthy funding, I emphasize again, bymy friend from Michigan, this is another assault and an assault in theamount of in excess of what I think we should assault the SDI Budget Program.If the amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan would prevail, thenone thing and one thing only would be assured, and that would be that wewould fund the SDI Program at an amount less than it was funded at lastyear.To be very frank and open with my colleagues in the Senate, this Senatorhas always felt that we should basically fund the SDI Program at aboutor slightly above, not very much below certainly, the figure that was inthe budget for the present fiscal year in which we are operating.So I would simply say as worthy as this amendment is, and I salute thedo-gooder approach for these good programs that this money goes to, I wouldsimply say and I would argue that this is not significantly different andwe are voting once again on the measure as to whether we are not goingto make the cut in the SDI Program that we voted down on a close vote theother day. This is a rehash. It just funds the money in a different area.I hope that the tabling motion that I will make will prevail. I reservethe remainder of my time.[S13MY8-476]{S5727}Exhibit 1<ITAG tagnum="74">Exhibit </ITAG>1<ITAG tagnum="21">The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska has been waitingpatiently for 1 hour and 20 minutes after my friend from Louisiana hadoffered his amendment to give a response and the position of the ArmedServices Committee on his amendment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have no quarrel with the attitude that the Senator from Louisianaand, indeed, the Senator from Wisconsin have with regard to the SDI Program.I share many of the concerns they have since I have been intracately involvedin this matter from the very beginning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I would simply say, let us try and keep all of this in context. Itis true, in my mind, that one of the grave mistakes made with the SDI Programwas that from the day the President made the announcement, there has beenmore false information as to what this program could possibly bring aboutthan any other defense program that I have ever had anything to do with.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The President has certainly fanned much of that himself. I have beenone of those who said we are way overboard on what can be done with thisprogram. But I have always thought, in view of the Soviet threat_and whatthe Soviet Union is doing in this area today experimentationwise_we havean obligation to at least proceed to see what is here.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the worst things that happened, Mr. President, in this wholeunfortunate, or fortunate, discussion of SDI, depending upon one's pointof view, was the series of television advertisings that went out a yearand a half or 2 years ago which had a little girl with a crayon drawingan umbrella and then with the very clever audiovisual aids, while she wasplaying with this umbrella, the next thing you saw was crudely drawn bombscoming out of the air and glancing off of the umbrella in a harmless fashion.I thought that was a very simplistic way to try to describe the SCI Program,not unlike some of the statements that the President of the United Stateshimself has made about it. But I thought that was so simplistic that Ihoped it would have had the desired effect on the American people in recognizingthat any concept that we can have a perfect shield is nonsense. It is hogwash.It is never going to fly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Having said that, I think there are some benefits of a research programin the strategic defense initiative area and I have supported that. I willmove at an appropriate time_and I hope it will not be too long_to tablethe amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, and after that I intendto move to table the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana. Isimply am going to try as briefly as I can to put this in context, Mr.President, so that the Senate will really know what we are doing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, if you are against the SDI Program and think it should be abolishedor cut drastically, as the Senator from Wisconsin is suggesting, then youshould support that amendment, if you are basically against SDI in theamount the Armed Services Committee feels would be proper funding. Likewise,regardless of how it is presented to the Senate, the amendment of the Senatorfrom Louisiana essentially does the same thing except the Senator fromLouisiana is suggesting that we can use this money for defense better overhere on the space shuttle. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, I think that is not sound logic, and I want to emphasize onceagain, Mr. President, that the funding level of SDI, if anyone thinks weshould have some research and development in that area_and I would suggestthat the SDI exercise has done more to bring the Soviets to the bargainingtable than probably anything that we have done_is worth continuing at aboutthe level that we funded SDI last year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, a lot of figures are being thrown around, Mr. President. We shouldremember that last year we had a funding level for the SDI Program of $3.9billion. The President first requested a level of over $6 billion. Thatwas amended down to $4.8 billion in the formal request that came over fromthe administration. We have reduced that further. The House of Representativesin its actions of last week reduced that program to $3.4 billion, whichessentially would have been more than one-half of a billion dollars belowlast year's figure. If we would accept the amendment offered by the Senatorfrom Wisconsin or the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana,we would be down, even splitting the difference with the House of Representativesin conference, to a figure some $300 million to $400 million less thanlast year. I think that is far below what would be proper and wise at thisparticular juncture.</ITAG>The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.[S13MY8-478]{S5727}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, will the distinguished proponent yield the remainderof his time?[S13MY8-479]{S5727}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Could I save 20 seconds beyond that?[S13MY8-480]{S5727}DIXONMr. DIXON. Sure.[S13MY8-481]{S5727}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the Senator.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 3 minutesand 20 seconds.[S13MY8-482]{S5727}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I know my dear friend from Nebraska thinks thatwe pick on him and his Strategic Subcommittee. It reminds me of the storyof Willie Sutton, when they asked him why he robbed banks. He said, ``Becausethat is where the money is.'' And the money is in my friend from Nebraska'sStrategic Subcommittee.Here are my reasons for supporting the Senator from Michigan. First ofall, the House has $3.5 billion for SDI. We have $4.6 billion. The numberis going to be around $4 billion anyway. I would like to see us fight for$4 billion in the conference committee between the two Houses and use thisother $600 million usefully. A useful employment of the money is to useit for conventional weaponry. Nothing would be more significant than touse it for ammunition, as my friend from Michigan does, and to use it fordepot maintenance. I am chairman of that subcommittee. Depot maintenancein 1991 will look like it was 1981, so all through the Reagan years wewill not have gained anything on depot maintenance.My friend from Michigan would buy some Apache attack helicopters, the finestflying machine in the world, which would take the damage to the enemy.I think that is a significant investment of public funds.So I say, let us adopt the amendment of the Senator from Michigan, cutit to $4 billion, but stick with $4 billion in the conference_that willbe as much as we will get, anyway_and have the $600 million under the controlof the Senate and buy useful conventional weaponry that we can take tothe enemy.For that reason, I support the Senator from Michigan.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-483]{S5728}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds. This is a differentamendment from the amendment the other day on the space shuttle, becauseone of the arguments made against that was that it would take money outfrom the defense budget, in effect. This keeps the money in the defensebudget but uses it for higher defense priorities.Nobody can argue that this is in some way a modification of the summitagreement on the defense number that was reached last year. This keepsthat defense number where it is. It uses the $600 million for better andmore important defense items.[S13MY8-484]{S5728}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 10 minutes and theSenator from Michigan has 1 minute and 15 seconds.[S13MY8-485]{S5728}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend and colleaguefrom Illinois. I would simply point out once again that if we adopt theamendment offered by the Senator from Michigan, there is no possible waythat we could end at a $4 billion funding level for the SDI Program, becausethe Senator from Michigan would reduce this to $3.95 billion. And, as thetalented Senator from Illinois knows full well, the House of Representativesis not about to allow us to go to $3.95 billion, with the funding levelthat the House has already voted on below that figure in the House ArmedServices Committee and substantially below that to $3.43 billion for theSDI Program in the House of Representatives itself.So if it were possible, for example, to have an understanding that we wouldgo to the $3.95 billion level, as advanced by the Senator from Michigan,the Senator from Nebraska might not object. But I predict_in fact, I canalmost promise_that we will never reach that level in conference with theHouse of Representatives.Mr. President, this amendment is practically one and the same_a do-goodertype of amendment that is hard to argue with_that was offered the otherday by my colleague from Louisiana.I do not mind dealing with Willie Sutton. I think that the story that myfriend from Illinois told is a pretty good one. I do not mind debatingwith Willie Sutton and I do not mind arguing the pros and cons of the proposition.I do get a little weary of the number of Willie Suttons that I find myselfin conflict with on the floor of the U.S. Senate_``Willie'' <T4>Johnston, </T4>``Willie'' <T4>Levin, </T4>and ``Willie'' <T4>Dixon. </T4>They try and rob the bank each and every day, which makesthis particular depositor in the bank somewhat concerned.So I certainly hope that this amendment will not pass. I think we neednot debate this any further. I am prepared to offer the tabling motionand I am prepared to yield back the balance of my 7 or 8 minutes if myfriend from Michigan would yield back his time or use it up.[S13MY8-486]{S5728}LEVINMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will try to use up 30 seconds and yield backthe rest.The reason that we go to your bank is because we get a much better returnon our investment in these conventional items than you will with that additional$600 million for SDI. That is what the priority issue is. It is the returnon investment.I think this really is a do-better amendment. It has been called a do-gooderamendment by my dear friend from Nebraska. It is a do-better amendment.We can do better with our defense dollars, and this amendment does that.We ought to do the right thing here in the Senate. If $4 billion is theright level for SDI, then let us do that here and fight the battle in conference.Let us not put in more money than we should in terms of our national prioritiesin order to try to figure out and gain what might come out of conference.If I have any time remaining, I yield back the balance of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan yields back his remaining20 seconds.[S13MY8-487]{S5728}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of mytime at the conclusion of my statement when I will say, in just a moment,``I yield the floor.''Mr. President, I think the issue is totally drawn here. I think there isno need to continue the debate any further.So, at this time, I move to table the amendment offered by the Senatorfrom Michigan, and I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientsecond.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S13MY8-488]{S5728}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are making good progress. We have five amendmentshere that are agreed to which we will dispose of shortly. In the meantime,I would like to yield to the distinguished manager for whatever discussionshe and the leader might have with respect to progress on this bill.I would like to report, it is the opinion of the distinguished Senatorfrom Indiana, myself and others, that the bulk of the amendments left areamendments with which our distinguished colleagues have no desire to proceed.There are one or two out there that are contentious. The drug interdictionquestion is pretty well resolved. I understand there is a question of disputebetween the authorizers and the appropriators that I am told the distinguishedmanagers are even now discussing the resolution of, and I truly believe,may I say, even the abortion question and other things have been dealtwith and are no longer before us.So may I report to the distinguished managers and to the distinguishedleaders on both sides that it is the view of this Senator that we are ina position for a unanimous-consent agreement, if one can be developed.[S13MY8-498]{S5729}NUNNMr. NUNN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.[S13MY8-499]{S5729}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois, and Ithank him again and the Senator from Indiana for working so hard to getus where we are right now. I think we can at least see the tunnel, if notthe daylight. I believe we may see a little glimpse of daylight now ifwe can get the drug package worked out.We have several other amendments, but there are a lot of amendments onthe list that I think will fall by the wayside. We have capital punishmentthat is still a question, and if we have to deal with that, that will takea long time, as we all know. We have an abortion amendment, which, to myunderstanding, has been dropped.We do have a chance to get a unanimous-consent agreement now that we havethose two matters, at least one of those, under control. I hope the leaderwill propound a unanimous-consent agreement that we would basically takethe drug package and make sure we have that and have some time for discussionon that. We will have to make exception for that, but the rest of the amendments,other than two or three that we can specify, I believe are ready to comeoff the list. It depends on the unanimous-consent request.If we can get unanimous consent, for instance, to begin final passage at4 or 5 o'clock, depending on the leader's choice, and have under the normalprocedure all amendments that have not at that stage been dealt with thatMembers insist on being dealt with, we can have a 1-minute debate on eachside. I think most of the amendments will drop off.That would be my suggestion, and we can at least propound that unanimous-consentrequest and see what the result is.[S13MY8-500]{S5729}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, a quick point. When does the distinguished chairmananticipate the drug-related amendment would come up? I understood him tosay that that would take some time.[S13MY8-501]{S5729}NUNNMr. NUNN. The parties involved in that have been waiting for Senator <T4>Warner </T4>and myself for about an hour now. We have been in on theother meeting with the leader. So I suggest that perhaps a 30-minute discussion,if we can work out the details_there are two or three problems remaining_andthen it would probably take another half-hour to get everything drafted.Hopefully, by 3 o'clock we would be able to present that drug package onthe floor. That is an optimistic case, though, I have to admit.[S13MY8-502]{S5729}BYRDMr. BYRD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.[S13MY8-503]{S5729}BYRDMr. BYRD.

I askunanimous consent that the final vote occur on this bill at 5 o'clock p.m.,with paragraph 4, rule XII, being waived.[S13MY8-504]{S5729}STENNISMr. STENNIS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final voteoccur on passage of the DOD authorization bill today at 5 o'clock p.m.,with paragraph 4 of rule XII being waived, and with the understanding thatany amendments which are on the list and which Senators insist upon callingup, of course, may be called up with no more than 2 minutes equally dividedfor debate on such amendments, and that with respect to the drug-relatedamendment there be 1 hour on the amendment in the first degree, one-halfhour on an amendment in the second degree, and that should the 5 o'clocktime arrive before that amendment has been disposed of, that 5 o'clocktime would be accordingly readjusted so as to allow the drug-related amendmentto be disposed of within the total time limit of an hour and a half onthe first- and second-degree amendments.Several Senators addressed the Chair.[S13MY8-506]{S5729}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM.

The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Indianahave done a remarkable job in helping the floor managers expedite and lineup amendments.I tell all Senators though that we do intend to finish this bill todayor tonight or in the early hours of the morning tomorrow.It is not a matter of choice that we would have to go late. It is a matterof necessity. Everyone knows we are going to try to go to the INF Treatyas soon as we can have committee meetings next week, assuming that everythingworks out as we have been told by the people who have just come back fromGeneva. We will not be able to get back to this DOD bill in that case forseveral weeks, so we have got to finish this bill. We have got to get toconference. The House has completed their legislation. We have got to dothat to clear the roadblocks for the appropriations process and also tomake sure the Senate can maintain its schedule. So we are going to haveno choice but to push through as late as we can tonight. If it is hopeless,then it is hopeless and we will not finish. But that is the intention ofthe floor managers.[S13MY8-533]{S5730}McCLUREMr. M<T4>c</T4>CLURE and Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator yield? Could I ask the manager of the billa question? It will only take 30 seconds.Might I ask a question of the Senator from Illinois. I did not get to askthis when the distinguished chairman was on the floor. We are here talkingabout getting this bill finished and how urgent it is that we do that andtry to do it tonight. I have a general question. Why do we need a defenseauthorization bill every year? Did we not just do one last year? We finishedit when we were almost through with appropriations. Why do we have to dothis every year?[S13MY8-550]{S5731}DIXONMr. DIXON. May I say to my distinguished friend from New Mexico_and hisquestion is not a facetious one.[S13MY8-551]{S5731}DOMENICIMr. DOMENICI. Not at all.[S13MY8-552]{S5731}DIXONMr. DIXON. We had a 2-year authorization bill last year, but we could notget a 2-year appropriation bill to cover the authorization.And I suppose there is a goal here ultimately of achieving a more balancedway of doing this business. But we have not yet achieved it, may I sayto my friend from New Mexico.[S13MY8-553]{S5731}DOMENICIMr. DOMENICI. I have the greatest respect for the committee and its desireto be the policymaker on defense. But I have only been here 15 years andI can remember that we went 5 years without a defense authorization billin my short 15. I do not know what that means other than it is a statementthat maybe we did business kind of crazy then.But I wonder if it is not equally burdensome, rather difficult, and maybenot terribly responsive to be doing this every year followed right immediatelywith an appropriation bill with all the same issues. And I do think raisingit at this point does make a little sense in terms of trying to get somethings done.I know the committee did a marvelous job. I have the greatest respect forthe chairman. I wonder why we have to do it every year.[S13MY8-554]{S5731}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield?[S13MY8-555]{S5731}DOMENICIMr. DOMENICI. I am finished.[S13MY8-556]{S5731}NUNNMr. NUNN. My good friend from New Mexico is almost always right. But whenthere is an exception, it is a big exception. This is a big exception.We have not failed to have a defense authorization bill since 1961.[S13MY8-557]{S5731}DOMENICIMr. DOMENICI. I am not going to argue with the expert. But I believe wehave gone a number of years without a defense authorization bill.[S13MY8-558]{S5731}NUNNMr. NUNN. No. The Senator is just incorrect on that. I would hope he wouldtake a look at it. I would say that the Senator, being a member of theAppropriations and Budget Committees, could greatly assist in this processby seeing if we cannot start getting a 2-year budget, and a 2-year appropriation.We are trying to get a 2-year authorization. But by doing a 2-year authorization,and we simply turn over to the Appropriations Committee all the decisionson defense because they insist on a 1-year situation, then it is nevergoing to happen.So I say if the Senator really wants to do something about what I wouldjoin him in saying has become an absurd process, if you consider the BudgetCommittee, the authorization committee, the Appropriations Committee, andconsider we do all of them year by year, it becomes a collective absurdity.I agree with him on that. But as a member of those other two committees,I would hope he would follow our lead and start moving toward the 2-yearappropriation and budget.[S13MY8-559]{S5731}DOMENICIMr. DOMENICI. Let me say I do not want to take the Senator's time. I wholeheartedlyagree. My request for an explanation had nothing to do with singling outa process. I would be satisfied with 3-, 4-year authorization bills, 2-yearappropriations, and 2-year budgets. But I am merely pointing up that herewe are again 1 year at a time, a week before appropriations doing anotherauthorization bill on defense.I would say to my friend from Georgia if we had authorizations in all ofthese years we certainly had a number of them that were multiyear.[S13MY8-560]{S5731}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would say to the Senator again he is wrong. The first timewe have done a 2-year is this last year. I would insert in the <T4>Record</T4> without taking the Senate's time a record of the last 28years, the date that we have enacted the legislation on authorization,the number of days on the floor, the number of days in markup, the numberof amendments, the number of rollcalls, the number of hours of debate,and the number of conferees, the number of days in conference.

Iwill not speak on it, but I would ask the attention of my colleagues, Mr.President, because once again let me read especially for the benefit ofmy distinguished friend, the Senator from Idaho, what the crux of thislegislation in this amendment is.It basically says this: In the additional $100 million being funded forthe production of the Bigeye bomb, 1989-1990, that that production, especiallythe full-scale production, will not take place until this happens. Thecritical event that must happen, I say to my distinguished friend, is one,the operational and development test conducted in connection with suchbomb after the day of enactment of this act were realistic and adequateas certified by the General Accounting Office or the Comptroller General;two, the test plan, and objectives established for such bomb are clear,well defined, properly quantifiable; three, the design of such test supportsa valid statistical analysis of data; four, the criteria for no-test wereadequately defined in the test plan for such bomb; five, such bomb metor exceeded the test standards established for the bomb; and, sixth andfinal, such bomb is ready for full-scale production.These six elements, I say to my distinguished friend from Idaho, must beagreed to and certified to by the General Accounting Office before anyexpenditure of this new $100 million is actually expended.[S13MY8-582]{S5732}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. How long does the Senator think this will delay the deploymentof the Bigeye?[S13MY8-583]{S5732}PRYORMr. PRYOR. I say to my friend from Idaho, Mr. President, the Bigeye bombis not a new concept. It was originally conceived, the concept, 30 yearsago. This is the 30th anniversary. And it really does not work much betterin 1988 than when they first started testing in I would say probably somewherein the early 1970's. But my amendment basically addresses itself to thispoint: Let us as a Congress not condone going into full-scale productionof a bomb that in my personal opinion is flawed until the GAO certifiesthat the tests, the methodology of those test, has been accurate and thatthe bomb is now certifiable for full-scale production.I just hate to see us go into production of a flawed bomb, especially whenthe critical needs of many of our national defense areas are really actuallybeing underfunded.So I understand, Mr. President, the managers have agreed with this languagein the amendment. I further understand that all of those on this side andboth sides of the aisle are in agreement at this time and therefore I urgeadoption of the amendment.[S13MY8-584]{S5732}SYMMSMr. SYMMS addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If they choose to converse, pleaseretire to the Cloakroom. The Senate is not in order.The Senator from Idaho.[S13MY8-586]{S5732}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, it is not my intention to delay the Senate thisafternoon and to interfere with an agreement that has been worked out bythe leadership of both sides of the committee.But I think this tieup of an amendment is atypical of what it is that weare doing here in our entire defense capability, by putting our young peoplein harm's way because we are not fulfilling our basic constitutional commitmentto properly fund defense, and move forward on weapons systems that we needso that our adversaries will not use like-type weapons systems againstour troops.All one has to do is to visit the installations of our American troopsin Europe and recognize that one of the biggest threats they face is thepotential of chemical warfare being used against them in installations,whether it be at an air base or troops in the field or at supply areas,in the back areas that would be supporting the frontline troops. Thereis a continual effort to stop us from moving forward with technology thatis important. If we have this weapon, our adversaries probably will notuse it, because they will not want to contend with chemical warfare. Thiseffort does not make our troops safer. It makes it more dangerous.I disagree with this amendment.[S13MY8-587]{S5732}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Idaho yield?[S13MY8-588]{S5732}SYMMSMr. SYMMS.

At the same time, we have entered intoan accommodation of honor with the Senator from Arkansas. In view of that,it was the judgment of the managers and everyone here at the time thatwe should honor the request of the Senator from Arkansas and that we shouldtake the amendment.[S13MY8-590]{S5732}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his continuinginterest in making sure that we deploy a Bigeye bomb that works. I am surethe Senator shares, as I do, an appreciation of the critical requirementfor the Bigeye. This bomb represents the only near term solution to themost critical deficiency in our chemical deterrent posture_the capacityfor deep strike attacks with persistent agent.The compromise that was reached last night and is now before the Senateprovides all the funding requested in fiscal year 1989, and does not constrainthe expenditure of funds authorized and appropriated in prior years. Itthus establishes a conference issue with the House, that has limited useof prior year funds, and deleted all fiscal year 1989 funding.The compromise includes a fencing provision that requires a GAO certificationbefore fiscal year 1989 funding can be spent. The House has no similarprovision. This Senator will work in the conference to secure a positionthat protects the option both to maintain continuity of the low rate initialproduction line, and to proceed to full scale production of the Bigeyebomb only with the assurance that the Bigeye has proven to be reliableand producible.[S13MY8-591]{S5732}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE.

The question recurs on the amendment offered bythe distinguished Senator from Iowa.[S13MY8-595]{S5732}GRASSLEYMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment has already been read.  As one who has closely followed developments relating to the prosecutionof defense fraud, I was dismayed to recently learn of certain statutoryprovisions which severely undermine the vigorous prosecution of contractors.In particular, it has come to my attention that defense contractors arecurrently permitted to bill the Government for the full cost of their legalexpenses in fraud cases, as an element of contract cost. The anomolousresult: the same Government that prosecutes the fraud case pays the costof the defense. We as taxpayers pay twice_we fund the prosecution by DOJand DOD through the agency's budgets; then we subsidize the contractorand their high-priced lawyers.Such an arrangement, by the way, is wholly unprecedented in more than 200years of American jurisprudence. In no other case_whether it be a whitecollar, or other economic crime, or a street crime case_is a criminal defendantpermitted to recover the cost of his legal defense from the Government.I might add that the guilt or innocence of the defendant is irrelevantto this general prohibition on recovery of legal fees. Criminal defendantswho are acquitted have never been entitled to recover legal expenses incurredin their defense.In civil cases, private parties that prevail over the Government can recoverlegal expenses only by specific statutory authorization, such as the EqualAccess to Justice Act, which applies to all other business and individuals,and generally limits legal fee recovery to $75 per hour.Rest assured Mr. President, defense contractors and their high-priced lawyerswho currently bill the Government for their legal bill charge far, farmore than $75 per hour.Indeed, there were public reports that General Dynamics Corp. billed theGovernment some $21 million for attorneys fees, when it defended itselfduring a grand jury investigation in New Haven, CT. When the Governmentdropped other criminal fraud investigations against General Dynamics lastyear, the taxpayers were exposed to several million dollars in attorneyfee liability.In a recent fraud case against the Bell Helicopter Division of Textron,settled by the Government just 2 months ago, attorney costs of about $3.5million could have been billed to the Government as an element of allowablecost.In another case, it was reported that the Government had potentially millionsof dollars of legal fees exposure after the Justice Department decidednot to indict the Pratt andamp; Whitney Group for allegedly overchargingthe Government by $22 million on contracts at its West Palm Beach facility.Mr. President, how can this be? Why do defense contractors_some of thewealthiest corporations in America_get a benefit available to no otherbusiness or indvidual in this country?Well, tucked away in the 1986 defense authorization bill is a provisionthat permits a defense contractor's recovery of attorney fees and otherexpenses, as a matter of allowable cost, in any fraud case that does notresult in a finding of civil liability or a criminal conviction. Incredibly, prior to the addition of this provision, the Board of ContractAppeals had ruled that costs in defense of a fraud case which ended inconviction were also allowable. Thus, the Government was responsible forpayment of the legal bills of convicted felons. This amendment is a response to the 1986 defense authorization bill. Ithas a limited and direct purpose. That is to treat the legal bills of defensecontractors the same way we do for other businesses and individuals involvedin litigation with the Federal Government. This amendment would bar the recovery of legal fees as a matter of contractcost in any fraud case brought by the Government that resulted in a conviction,civil judgment of liability, administrative finding of liability, or adecision to suspend or debar the contractor. In no case_even where there is a finding of no civil liability or acquittal_willthe contractor recover legal fees in excess of $75 per hour. With the enactmentof this amendment, the taxpayers won't have to pick up the tab for thecontractor's high-priced lawyers. Just as in the Equal Access to Justice Act, the amendment provides an exceptionto the $75 per hour limit where there is a special factor, such as thelimited availability of qualified attorneys to represent the contractor.The amendment thus equalizes the attorney fees treatment of these civiland criminal defendants with all other defendants. The other body has alreadyagreed to add this amendment to the bill. Mr. President, I know it is a terrible thing to be wrongly accused of lawviolations by the Federal Government. That is why I have supported attorneyfees provisions in the past. I sponsored the 1984 and 1985 Senate amendmentsto the Equal Access to Justice Act, to provide small businesses and individualsa more equal footing when they prevail in litigation over the Federal Government.But I cannot support the current disparate treatment and special benefitsafforded some of our Nation's biggest and wealthiest companies. So I urgemy colleagues to join me in support of this amendment. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.[S13MY8-596]{S5733}ROTHMr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment of my friendand colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa. It appears to me that theBradley-Roth amendment poses a fundamental question of equity before thelaw. The question it poses is_should the Government pay the attorneys'fees of defense contractors who have been found guilty of fraud? Thereare few, I believe, who would support an affirmative answer. It is importantto recognize in answering the question certain fundamental rules of law.First, the ``American rule'' regarding the payment of attorneys' fees isthat each side pays its own attorneys, win or lose.Second, the United States as sovereign cannot be made to pay any costs,any attorneys' fees, in any action, win or lose, unless, or course, itgrants its consent by statute.Third, the United States has granted its consent by statute through theEqual Access to Justice Act passed in 1980. That statute, which establishesthe general rule for individuals and small businesses, is considerablyless generous than either the pending amendment or current law regardingdefense contractors. Basically, the Government has agreed to pay the otherside's attorneys' fees only if it is determined that the Government's casewas not ``substantially justified.'' In those cases where that determinationis made, the general rule is that the Government will not pay more than$75 per hour.In contrast, special rules apply to defense contractors. The Governmentpays their attorneys' fees in full no matter who wins the case. The meritsof the case are deemed irrelevant. Moreover, there is no cap on what theGovernment pays.In my opinion, this result cries out for correction. The Grassley-Rothamendment does exactly that. If the defense contractors lose the case,they must pay their own attorneys' fees. If they win, the Government paysbut at a rate generally not to exceed $75 per hour, the same rate establishedin the Equal Access to Justice Act.Please understand that this $75 cap in no way interferes with a defensecontractor's right to hire any attorney at any price. The Grassley-Rothamendment only limits how much of that price the American taxpayers willpay. It will thereby end the practice where defense contractors and theirattorneys don't care how high the legal fees may be, since they are borneby the taxpayers. It is not a bad result if the amendment causes defensecontractors to worry about holding down costs. Everyone else does.Defense contractors may argue that their attorneys' fees, like other costs,are simply part of the overall cost of completing their contracts withthe Government. But that is not our jurisprudence. When wrongdoing is involved,the wrongdoer is made to absorb the costs, not pass them on. For example,businesses may not deduct fines imposed as a cost of doing business. Atrucker may not deduct speeding tickets as a cost of delivering goods.The Grassley-Roth amendment recognizes the fact that Government contractorsstand on a different footing from Government subjects. The amendment ismore generous than the Equal Access to Justice Act. Generally, contractorsshould be able to pass on their costs to the Government. But not coststhat arise from proven wrongdoing. That's what the Grassley-Roth amendmentsays.Mr. President, the need for this amendment, in my opinion, is clear andobvious. In the interests of equity, I ask that the Senate accept the Grassley-Rothamendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment which has been offered by Senator<T4>Grassley</T4> addresses a very important problem, and I congratulatehim for it. He has put his finger on something which we should address.I appreciate and share the concerns that Senator <T4>Grassley</T4> has raised. When a contractor is found to have committeda wrongful act, we should not have to pay his attorney's fees for defendingthat conduct. Right now, if the Government successfully prosecutes a contractorand the contractor is convicted in a case other than a fraud case, we stillend up paying the contractor's legal fees, and that really is not right.On the other hand, I am concerned that the language that has been offeredby the Senator from Iowa may be too broad. It may unduly limit contractor'sattorney fees in ordinary contract litigation and even in cases where thecontractor is found not to be at fault.For this reason, I have sent an amendment to the desk, an amendment tothe amendment offered by Senator <T4>Grassley,</T4> to focus more narrowly on cases in which defense contractorsare found to have engaged in some kind of wrongful conduct. Under my proposal,the Government would not have to pay directly or indirectly a contractor'slegal fees in any case where:First. The contractor is convicted of violating Federal or State law;Second. The contractor is assessed a monetary penalty for a violation ofFederal or State law;Third. The contractor is found civilly liable for fraud or a similar offenseunder Federal or State law;Fourth. The contractor is suspended, debarred, or terminated for defaultfor a violation of Federal or State law; orFifth. A case of any of these types is settled by compromise or consent.Mr. President, the kinds of cases covered by my amendment all involvedwrongful conduct by the contractor, and there is no reason that I knowof why the Government should be paying for contractors' legal fees in thesekinds of cases.But, again, because I am afraid that the amendment that was offered wentbeyond that and it was broader than that and could actually get to caseswhere a contractor was found not to have been at fault or not to be guiltyof a crime, I have sent this amendment to the amendment of the Senatorfrom Iowa to the desk. Again, I commend him. I understand that he may wantto take some action relative to his underlying amendment at this point.If he does so, I would hope that we could make some progress in conferencebecause again I believe that he has put his finger on an important problem.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.[S13MY8-616]{S5735}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, there is no objection to the amendment on thisside of the aisle.I think it should be said for the record that the amendment is very incomplete.It should also add the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, and nuclear-fired aircraftcarrier, because these F-15 Strike Eagles have never been in the administration'sproposal package. It has not been talked about. There is no discussionof selling the F-15 Strike Eagles to Saudi Arabia.I guess, if the Senator insists on offering the amendment, we will acceptit. But I think it should be said for the record that Saudi Arabia shouldnot feel like they are being singled out for some kind of extra treatmenthere on the floor over the F-15 Strike Eagles, because the administrationnever suggested they sell them nor have they suggested they sell the MXmissile or B-1B bomber or any of the other more sophisticated weapons.[S13MY8-617]{S5735}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, I had not intended to make an oral statementbut rather put the statement in the <T4>Record</T4>. But I am afraid there is some confusion as to what thisamendment does. Under the circumstances, I think that I feel compelledto do so.Mr. President, a broader version of this amendment was approved last Decemberby the Senate. It was worked out with Defense Secretary Carlucci duringhis tenure as National Security Adviser. Concerns were raised in the Houseregarding the breadth of the original language, and I agreed to compromiseon it. The measure now before us represents that compromise.It is my understanding that this measure remains acceptable to the administrationand to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.In order that we may explain this to my friend from Idaho, last December,the administration notified Congress of its intent to sell a large packageof arms to Saudi Arabia. Many Members of Congress felt that certain portionsof the package were inappropriate. I approached the minority leader toenlist his help in arranging a meeting with then National Security AdviserCarlucci. A number of Senators participated in that meeting.Mr. President, the outcome of those discussions is the original amendmentthat the Senate approved last December 9, and for the most part, it isthe measure we are discussing now.It stipulates that the Saudi Air Force's inventory of F-15 aircraft shallnot exceed the original number of 60. The 12 planes that were includedin this sale are to be held at Saudi expense here in the United States,and be transferred to the Saudis only on a one-for-one replacement basis.In addition, the 12 replacement planes and all F-15's previously deliveredto the Saudis shall not receive equipment upgrades from the United Statesto give them a ground-attack capability.Finally, the measure proscribes the sale to Saudi Arabia of the F-15 E series, which is a ground-attack aircraft.Perhaps some of my colleagues do not remember the veritable laundry listof advanced armaments that the Saudis presented us with last year. Now,half a year after the fact, it is easy to forget how much work went intothat sale. We hammered out an agreement which gave the Saudis their armspackage_but less in line with their dreams than with their legitimate defenseneeds.Mr. President, I want to reiterate that this amendment is part of an armsdeal worked out with the administration, the minority leader, and severalof us in the Senate. Also, it is my understanding that the Saudis indicatedthat they were satisfied with that result in a meeting with the President,as well as with the National Security Adviser at that time. A broader versionof this amendment already passed the Senate. [S13MY8-618]{S5735}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Will the Senator yield for a question? [S13MY8-619]{S5735}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM. Yes. [S13MY8-620]{S5735}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Does the Senator understand that this Senator said the minorityaccepts the amendment? We do accept the amendment. [S13MY8-621]{S5735}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM. I know, but I had the feeling, I must say to my colleaguefrom Idaho, that somehow I think you were confused as to what this amendmentis all about. [S13MY8-622]{S5735}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I just want you to know that you do not have to go on with thatspeech if you do not feel compelled to. [S13MY8-623]{S5735}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM. Thank you very much. It certainly pleases me no end thatyou told me that I did not have to continue on, but I think I will finishit. It is just a few more lines. A broader version of this amendment already passed the Senate. In fact,since that time, the Middle East has become something of an open flea marketfor sophisticated arms sales. Indeed, Mr. President, I must confess that at times, with all the fancyhardware that is piling up in the Middle East, it seems to me that theParis Air Show could just as easily be held in Riyadh. Even as we speak,a sale is pending which includes 200 Bradley fighting vehicles, TOW missilesand launchers, and support equipment for the Saudi's AWACS aircraft. Ineed not remind my colleagues of the recent revelation that our supposedallies in Riyadh hid from us their purchase of Chinese intermediate-rangeballistic missiles. Mr. President, we are here now debating language which was previously ageedto as part of serious negotiations undertaken in good faith and in a responsiblemanner. It was a process of give and take that Secretary Carlucci observed``* * * was in marked contrast to earlier public disputes over such issues.''What is the problem with limiting the number of F-15 aircraft in the Saudiinventory to 60? The monarchy certainly did not prove itself willing touse those advanced planes to assist us when an Iraqi jet pumped two deadlyExocet missiles into the<T3> Stark.</T3>What is the problem with prohibiting the Saudis from buying ground-attackupgrades for their existing fleet of F-15's? Who, exactly are they planningto attack on the ground? Some will suggest that an Iraqi victory in thegulf war would pose a serious tank or other ground threat to the Saudis.This is no justification for letting the Saudis give their F-15's ground-attackcapability. They already have about 20 Tornado attack aircraft that they'rebuying from the British, with another 50 on order. Also, the Kuwaitis havejust announced that they want to buy 40 F-18 fighter/attack aircraft.What about the F-15``E'', which my amendment bars from sale to the Saudis?This is not just a ground-attack plane, this is the most sophisticatedground-attack jet in our own inventory. The ``Strike Eagle,'' as it iscalled, is meant to fulfill the U.S. Air Force's ground-attack missionsuntil the next generation advanced tactical fighter comes on line.Mr. President, I should also note parenthetically that nothing in thislanguage would prevent the Saudis from requesting other ground-attack aircraftfrom United States, such as the advanced F-16, or even the newer F-18 thatKuwait is requesting.The negotiators last fall clearly saw no reason why the Saudis would everneed such an extraordinary plane, and felt justified in including sucha prohibition in the amendment.I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

With the budget summit agreement,it has now slipped to fiscal year 1990.The project is 95 percent design complete, and according to last year'srequest for fiscal year 1989, the contract was scheduled to be awardedin December 1988 with construction to begin in February 1989. Every delaywill create hardships in operating two separate facilities, the old hospitaland the new clinic, with limited staff. When the new clinic is finished,patients may have to be transported three to four blocks down the streetbetween the clinic and the old hospital. This will require additional personneland could endanger the welfare of the patients. A deferment of this projectto fiscal year 1990 would extend this hardship for an additional year andincrease the total cost by approximately $2 million.Phase II will include two three-story buildings, the ancillary building,and the inpatient tower totaling 301,000 square feet. The ancillary buildingwill house central materiel, surgery, ICU/CCU, labor/delivery/postpartum/nursery,and general patient services such as ER/MCC, radiology, pathology, physicaltherapy, and the dental clinic. The inpatient tower will include 157 beds,the inpatient pharmacy, automation management, nutritional care, patientadministration, three medical-surgical and one pediatric nursing unit.I have spoken to Dr. William Mayer, Assistant Secretary of Defense forHealth Affairs who assures me that the Department of Defense can executeboth part II of the Fort Sill Hospital and the Seoul project through phasedfunding over a 2-year period, fiscal year 1989-90. This approach will allowconstruction to begin on both badly needed projects in fiscal year 1989and will not affect the Department's funding requirements in either fiscalyear. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Dr. Mayer stating hissupport for this approach be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record</T4>, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">Assistant Secretary of Defense, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, April 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>Don Nickles,</T4> <ITAG tagnum="55">U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.</ITAG>[S13MY8-639]{S5737}<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Dear Senator Nickles:</T4> Pursuant to my conversation with you andSenator Boren, the Department of Defense can execute both Part II of theFt.

Mr. President, meeting the health care needs of our militarypersonnel, dependents and retirees is a promise we, as a nation, make tothose who serve to protect our freedoms. I understand that this amendmenthas been agreed to, and I thank my colleagues on the Armed Services Committeeand the staff for their assistance. I believe that we will not be ableto fulfill our health care promise both at Fort Sill and in Seoul in themost cost-efficient and timely manner.[S13MY8-641]{S5737}BORENMr. BOREN. Mr. President, my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. <T4>Nickles, </T4>and I offer an amendment which will expeditiously allowthe construction of two Army hospitals which are needed for the medicaldelivery to Army military personnel and their dependents at Fort Sill,OK, and Seoul, Korea. In these times of budgetary constraints, it becomes extremely difficultto fund the backlog of military construction. I want to commend Mr. <T4>Dixon </T4>and Mr. <T4>Humphrey </T4>and their staff for the excellent cooperation my colleague,Mr. <T4>Nickles, </T4>and I have received in solving this particular situation.For the third year in a row, the Reynolds Army Hospital at Fort Sill, OK,was dropped from the President's budget request. A hospital for Seoul,Korea, was included at a cost of $55 million and is authorized in thislegislation. The Department of Defense has agreed to divide this fundingbetween Korea and Oklahoma which will allow both projects to proceed inan orderly fashion. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes the hospital in Korea at a fiscalyear funding level of $28 million and the hospital at Fort Sill at a fiscalyear 1989 funding level of $27 million and keeps the military constructiontotal at the same level as authorized by the Armed Services Committee.It is my understanding that this amendment will be accepted. Again, I wantto thank the members of the Armed Services Committee for their very ableassistance in this matter.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question ison agreeing to the amendment.The amendment (No. 2063) was agreed to.[S13MY8-642]{S5737}DIXONMr. DIXON.

I say that becausethere have been reports that the administration is considering grantingMFN status to the Soviet Union. While the Soviet Union is making progresson the human rights front, it remains in severe violation of major provisionsof the Helsinki Final Act, especially regarding human rights. What thisamendment would do is deny MFN status to any Helsinki signatory which isnot in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Helsinki accords.It would not affect countries already receiving MFN. In his testimony before the Helsinki Commission this week, Secretary ofCommerce Verity stated that the administration would require the SovietUnion to comply with the Jackson-Vanik requirement linking MFN with ``theright or opportunity to emigrate.'' I was reassured to hear that. But Ialso believe that it is important to tie the granting of MFN status, whichhas enormous political symbolism on top of its economic impact, to progresson a much broader range of human rights. Secretary Verity also indicated that he would have no objection to legislationsuch as this amendment. But I must, in good faith, inform my colleaguesthat the Commerce Department has been calling my staff to suggest thatthe Secretary didn't really mean what he said.I would remind my colleagues that we are not asking the Soviets to do anythingthey haven't already promised to do 13 years ago in Helsinki. Among otherthings, the Soviets promised, and I quote from principle VII of the FinalAct, concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms, to:[S13MY8-653]{S5737}<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including thefreedom of thought, conscience, religion, or belief, for all without distinctionas to race, sex, language, or religion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political,economic, social, cultural, and other rights and freedoms, all of whichderive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essentialfor his full and free development. </ITAG>The declaration continues that the signatories ``confirm the right of theindividual to know and act upon his rights and duties in this field.''We are all aware that things are happening in the Soviet Union. There havebeen some changes for the better. I traveled there recently and I saw andsensed some changes. But I do not think any of my colleagues are goingto tell me that the Soviets are now or will be in the immediate futurein substantial compliance with the obligations I just enumerated.This amendment is needed because the granting of MFN, which would be soldas a temporary measure designed to encourage liberalization in the SovietUnion, would not be temporary at all. We all know that once a stream oftrade is established, and contracts are signed, there is no force on Earththat can turn off the tap. If the Soviets want MFN status, let them demonstratetheir desire and their right to such status by complying with the Helsinkiaccord.I am concerned that Secretary Verity sees it the other way round. He toldthe Helsinki Commission he thinks we will do better if we increase tradeand then use that as a lever on Soviet behavior. In the 1970's, we triedto use trade and arms control to lever Soviet behavior, and what did weget? Angola, Ethiopia, the fall of Saigon, and the invasion of Afghanistan.I think it is an excellent indicator of the way United States-Soviet tradelevers us more than it levers them, to recall that Ronald Reagan, the moststaunchly anti-Communist candidate we have ever had, felt he had to promiseto revoke the grain embargo. Let me repeat that this amendment would notaffect any nation currently enjoying MFN status. Nor, as I mentioned earlier,would it impose any new requirements that signatories of the Helsinki Acthave not already agreed to. Nor would it interfere with the Jackson-Vanik,which was always understood to address a much broader spectrum of concernsthan just emigration.This amendment is also generous, and realistic, in that it does not requirecomplete compliance with the Helsinki accords. The requirement is for ``substantiallycomplete compliance.'' That means:A pattern of overall compliance comparable to that of democratic signatories; A structure of law, regulations and procedures that stacks the deck infavor of the individual, rather than using the law as a bludgeon againstthe ordinary citizen;  And the ability of monitors, both within a country and from other signatories,to freely collect and disseminate information on compliance.  If indeed the Sovet Union makes a quantum leap in human rights, even ifit may not achieve total compliance, this amendment recognizes that sucha development could be rewarded.  Mr. President, I have been told that this amendment does not belong onthis defense authorization bill. But I believe that there are very goodreasons to include it in the defense bill.  If the administration is indeed considering granting MFN status at thistime, it is critical for the Senate to send a message immediately thatwe do not believe the Soviet Union is deserving of that status.  Let me also remind my colleagues that the formal title of the HelsinkiConference, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, emphasizesthe security dimension of the Helsinki process in particular, and humanrights in general. As the signatories observe in principle VII, ``The participatingstates recognize the universal significance of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms, respect for which is an essential factor for the peace, justice,and well-being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relationsand cooperation among themselves as among all states.'' That sounds tome like the very essence of security.  Let me as my colleagues this: Why do we have a defense bill in the firstplace, why do we spend all this money on guns and tanks and missiles? Wedo so because we are threatened by an ideology which is based on the denialof the rights and freedoms which we enjoy and which are described so wellin the Helsinki accord. The threat to the United States is not just Sovietmissiles and tanks. It is the denial of those rights, and the attempt todeny those rights to others, including ourselves.[S13MY8-654]{S5738}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, this side supports the amendment.

On the otherhand, I do not want that statement to be taken as a kind of a tacit understanding,that, since this has jurisdictional questions attached to it, that it isgoing to be automatically dropped in the conference. [S13MY8-662]{S5738}DIXONMr. DIXON. No, not at all. May I say that I personally support the ideaand I support the amendment. Mr. President, if I may be heard briefly?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. [S13MY8-663]{S5738}DIXONMr. DIXON. Here is the situation, may I say to my colleagues. It is 5 minutesto 3. We have assiduously worked this list. I want to represent to my colleagueson the floor and wherever they may be and to the two distinguished leadersand to the managers, the distinguished Senator from Georgia and the DistinguishedSenator from Virginia, that the Senator from Indiana and I, and now theSenator from Idaho and I, have worked this list. There is one amendment that a Senator would still like to offer. The Senatorfrom Texas would like to offer a coal amendment. He wanted to have a 30-minutetime limit, equally divided. This manager or deputy manager, who is from a coal State, was willing todo that, though I would oppose the Senator from Texas. The two Senators from Pennsylvania will not agree to a 30-minute time limit.I do not know if they will agree to anything. But the point is that thatis what we are down to, and I would like the two leaders and the two managersto know that there is nothing left in this store. The shelves are bare.Unless you want to start arguing about coal, I cannot think of anythngelse to do around this place until such time as my colleagues are preparedto deal with the UC.[S13MY8-664]{S5738}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE. </T4>Before doing that, would the Senator yield for a unanimous-consentrequest? [S13MY8-665]{S5738}DIXONMr. DIXON. I will be happy to. [S13MY8-666]{S5738}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE. </T4>Mr. President, I failed to do this before the passageof the last amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senators <T4>Helms </T4>and <T4>Armstrong </T4>be listed as original cosponsors of the amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [S13MY8-667]{S5738}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [S13MY8-668]{S5738}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [S13MY8-669]{S5738}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I would like to take the floor briefly whilethere is a little spare time here this afternoon and speak on the billand just say basically what I am going to say to my colleagues is thatwe are very dramatically underfunding defense in this, in the establishmentof our priorities here in the Nation's Capital. I rise today to remind my colleagues of their responsibilities, responsibilitiesoutlined in that document which originally established this great body.The Constitution provides our charter, defines our form and mandates ourresponsibilities. I am concerned, however, that we are not living up toits expectations. We are charged by that document to provide for the commondefense, to raise and support armies and to provide and maintain a Navy.I remind my colleagues of James Madison's caution, when he wrote in theFederalist Papers, ``If one nation maintains constantly a disciplined Army,ready for the service of ambition or revenge, it obliges the most pacificnations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take correspondingprecautions.'' How then does one explain a fourth year of declining defensebudgets?That is exactly what is happening here, Mr. President. This is the fourthyear of declining defense budgets, if you adjust these budgets in realdollar outlays in real terms. When reviewing defense production lines,everywhere you go you find out that we are not buying enough of whateverit is we are buying to get an economical buy because of budget constraints.For example, Mr. President, I noted the other day that the 100th B-1B bomberwas built. It came in under budget, ahead of schedule, and they closeddown the line. The first 100 B-1's cost the taxpayers of the United States$270 million apiece. The defense contractor offered the Government to buildanother 100 for $150 million apiece.It is a penetrating bomber that is unsurpassed in the world. The reasonthat we are not building the 200 instead of 100 is because of the prioritieshere in the Nation's Capital because it is more fun to go out here andoffer to send out money and checks to people in different kinds of programs,social welfare programs, than it is to spend money on defense of the country.I would just say to my colleagues who mandate these declining defense budgetsthat we would ask them one question:Has the threat been reduced? Is the world a safer place today than it was4 years ago? Have the Soviets renounced their intention to export communismthroughout the world?I would say, if anyone thinks so they should visit Afghanistan, they shouldgo to Pakistan where they will find that Mr. Gorbachev's KGB killed 250innocent civilians last year, wounded another 1,000 or so with bombs, state-supportedterrorist bombs set off in Pakistan, run by Mr. Gorbachev's KGB.It is their intention to export communism around the world and they havebeen pushing right along. They are pushing into Central America and Nicaragua.They are pushing on into Africa. There has been a relentless expansionin every case, and it is very interesting to note, Mr. President, thatin every instance in the world where we have had the courage to stand upand give the people who are seeking freedom an opportunity to fight forthat freedom, we are winning. Because people choose freedom over oppressivecommunism every time if they are given a choice.What is very concerning to this Senator is, in addition to the fact thatbudget agreements were made here last December that have put us into thisdownward spiral on defense spending and an expansion of nondefense spending_ifyou look at the budget you will see that nondefense spending is expandingat a fairly big rate and defense spending is contracting.But we will find that in every instance where we stand up to the Sovietexpansionism, we are winning. But in cases like Central America where theCongress fails to see the difference between freedom and oppression andrefuses to give the freedom fighters help, of course, the Soviets continueto pump aid and equipment, materiel, and support into Nicaragua to ensconcetheir tentacles into Central America. Mr. President, most likely I will vote for this bill because I see no greatvalue in voting against it. But I want to go on record, and I think mycolleagues who are not on the committee should be aware_the defense ofthis country, the procurement of the needed equipment to keep the moraleof the troops, the sailors, the airmen, to keep the capability, the operationalor maintenance capability at a highly honed level so they will be readyin case the curtain should come down_we are now starting down the slipperyslope again toward weaker defenses, toward a more hollow military, andwe are not going to be able to continue in this direction without sufferingdire consequences in the future. We are not devoting, Mr. President, the funds that we should be to keepan acceptable level of defense. You cannot just have defenses at a reducedprice simply by devoting some funds to weapons modernization, that theresulting level of technological sophistication will be sufficient to guarantee.Nothing can be further from the truth. By adopting that approach, we onlyhighlight our vulnerabilities. It is just not sufficient to have a fewof the most sophisticated weapons in the world if we cannot afford to supportthem when they are deployed or replace them if they are destroyed. I had an opportunity to visit McDonnell Douglas Aircraft in the early partof this week. It is quite impressive to see the shop where F-18's F-15's,AV8-B's are being manufactured in a shop-like condition. It is interestingto note that some of the old hands who have been there the last 25 yearsat McDonnell Douglas pointed out to me that in the same shop in 1967, theywere producing 72 phantoms a month in that shop. They are lucky to produce5 or 6 aircraft in that shop now or maybe 10 at a maximum. The point I am making is that we are building some very fine aircraft andother fine weapons systems, Mr. President, but we are not making a commitmentto build enough of them that we could ever replace them if we get in awartime situation. We are fooling ourselves and we have fooled ourselves,in my view, in believing that we can continue to pursue our interests inthe world and guarantee our own and our allies' security without payingfor it. We are, with the passage of this bill, continuing a slide in defense spendingthat ultimately will result in a military force that, as the distinguishedchairman mentioned, has the potential to become hollow, a mile wide andan inch deep; a force which may get there firstest with the mostest, butit will not be able to stay because it will not be able to sustain itselfwith the weapons systems we are buying in such few numbers. They requiresuch highlytrained, skilled people to operate them that it will take toolong to replace them if we should ever get into any kind of a sustainedconflict.I say this: I think President Reagan made significant strides in addressingthe U.S. military deficiencies over the course of the first 6 years ofhis administration.But the continuing congressional budget cuts and the ongoing growth ofthe Soviet military capabilities have combined to keep the United Statesbehind. Simply put, the Soviets have retained the initiative in their armsbuildup, and turning that around to a United States advantage will requirea continuous, long-term commitment by the Congress to rebuild the UnitedStates nuclear and conventional forces in order to ensure the gains thatwe have made over the first 6 years of this administration.The Congress needs to end that feast-or-famine cycle which characterizesthe approach that we have had here in this country on defense. We havehad a huge bow wave of spending once President Carter started pushing forit. In fact, I would say President Carter deserves some praise for thatbecause in 1979 after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and during 1980,he asked for tremendous increases in the budget on the defense spendingof this country. President Reagan was elected in 1980 on that platform,and the Congress made a bigger commitment. So there was a big bow waveof spending that went into defense.Now we are cutting back. It would seem to this Senator that it would makea lot more sense to have a stable, steady growth in defense spending onan annualized basis or a biannualized basis and sustain what we are doingand stay the course with a slight increase every year and purchase theneeded supplies and equipment, let the pilots and the troops have the adequatetraining time, ammunition supplies to fire to practice to keep current.Then we will not have to have that slide back<ITAG tagnum="80">down and then we will be faced with the reality of our own security.</ITAG>It is simply not enough to modernize. We must be able to sustain our forcesand their weapons systems. By failing to adequately provide for the commondefense, we are continuously forcing the services to choose between readinessand modernization, between forestructure and operations, choices guaranteedto increase the risk of our Nation and increase our national interest andthe choices guaranteed to lead to increased casualties on the battlefield.Mr. President, when you ask a question in the Armed Services Committeeabout what these cutbacks mean, say, to the infantry side of the U.S. MarineCorps, General Gray answered the question that we are cutting out threeoperational infantry battalions out of the U.S. Marine Corps. That is notcutting out fat. We always hear people say they want a lean, mean, tough defense. When youstart cutting out the infantry battalions, you are weakening the defensesof the country. Mr. President, as far as I am concerned, I am not going to succumb to theallure that we can do more with less in our approach to defense spending.If we are to live up to the expectation of our charter and to meet theresponsibilities of our fellow citizens, in my review, we must do betterthan we are doing in this recent budget cycle that has gone now since lastfall through this year. We better start thinking right now that next year when we come back in1989, this Senate needs to address the priorities of spending and reestablishourself in terms of our priorities, what is in our national interest, andwhat it is that is the most single important function of the Federal Government.That, of course, is to provide for the common defense, to preserve peaceand freedom, which are inseparable, Mr. President. I think we should certainly recognize that if this is the trend of thefuture, that we are going to be in a real world of hurt in about 5 yearsdown the road from where we are right now when we wake up some morningand recognize_and it will become a common understanding_that we are waybehind on defense, we have to spend more money on defense. That will costus a great deal more than it would be to have a steady, sustained, reasonableapproach to this, keep the morale of the troops in the field high, keepthe retention levels up and certainly provide them with the best possibleequipment so if they ever do get in harm's way that it will be the peoplethat put them in harm's way that suffer and not our troops, our sailors,and airmen.

Mr. President, this amendment requires a Presidential reportto the Congress on the future configuration of our strategic forces priorto the signing of any agreement on a START Treaty with the Soviet Union.Arms control is wise but only wise and prudent if it enhances our nationalsecurity and that of our allies. It is obvious that any arms control agreementshould only be entered into if it fits into a plan for the modernizationof the size and functions of our military forces and enhances our overallsecurity. This is a complex task and needs to take into account the actions,probable and possible, by our adversary under the scenario of any armscontrol agreement.The report which is required by this amendment would be submitted priorto the signing of a START Treaty, and in any event no later than September15, 1988. The Congress must have the necessary level of confidence thatany arms treaty that is entered into is done so only with a clear understandingof the force structure being contemplated. The architecture of our futurenational security posture must be developed to the satisfaction of notonly the administration but also the Congress, and in particular the Senate,which has the role under the Constitution of giving its advice and consentto treaties. It would be the height of folly to rush into a START agreementwithout the precise development of this architecture.The dangers and pitfalls of sloppiness in the strategic area could openthe Nation to mortal danger. It would be far better to have no arms controlagreement than to have one which, attractive on its face, is not cementedinto a viable conception of how we are going to defend the Nation and continueto deter our adversaries and support our allies.This amendment is a rifle shot, aimed at the possibility of agreement ona START Treaty in the near future, and is intended to make sure that allthe exits are covered, remembering that a mouse that only has one holefor an exit is not a very wise mouse, all the necessary planning has beenmade to take care of our national security requirements. We need to besure of that. The amendment requires that alternative force postures beoutlined, that the costs of those postures be identified, that survivabilityand retaliatory capabilities of those force postures be assessed in lightof Soviet first-strike potential, and that the dangers of a Soviet breakouton those force postures be fully considered. Mr. President, we owe thistype of long-term analysis to our allies and to future generations of Americanswho depend on what we do here for their continued freedom and security.Mr. President, I yield the floor.[S13MY8-681]{S5741}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, last week Senators <T4>Grassley, Pressler, </T4>and <T4>Nickles</T4> joined me in visiting with our START negotiator, AmbassadorReid Hanmer, and our defense and space negotiator, Ambassador Hank Cooper,in Geneva.Although a number of crucial differences still separate the United Statesand the Soviet Union, a basic potential framework for deep cuts in strategicnuclear weapons is taking shape.The object of START is not just to cut but to enhance the stability ofdeterrence. But greater stability requires properly structured deterrentforces in the post-START era.While our negotiators work carefully and precisely to resolve outstandingdifferences, our force planners should be developing the best possibleforce structure under a START agreement.This amendment, as appropriately described by the distinguished majorityleader, simply asks the President to share the administration's post-STARTforce posture analysis with the Congress. This is vital because, afterall, it is the Congress which must authorize and appropriate for any strategicforces which we may need to enhance stability under START.We offer this amendment to encourage and help our President's efforts toachieve deep reductions in nuclear weapons. If we in the Senate understandwhat force structure assumptions are necessary to make START a good treaty,ratification will be that much easier when the time comes.Furthermore, there will be no surprises on Capitol Hill when the next Presidentasks for authorization and appropriation for whatever strategic forcesare necessary.This type of thinking can only enhance the consensus behind America's defenseand arms control policies.I would like to thank the majority leader for his insight into this matter,and his work to formulate a proposal we could all agree upon. I also thankthe Senator from California [Mr. <T4>Wilson</T4>] for his expertise, his dedication to enhancing America'ssecurity, and his hard work in developing this amendment.I thank the majority leader for his insight into this matter and his workto formulate a proposal we could agree upon. I also thank the Senator fromCalifornia, Senator <T4>Wilson, </T4>for his expertise and dedication to enhancing America'ssecurity and his hard work in helping us develop this amendment.[S13MY8-682]{S5741}WILSONMr. WILSON addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.[S13MY8-683]{S5741}WILSONMr. WILSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Republican leader, forhis generous comments. I thank him and the majority leader for having takenthe time and the effort to put before this body what I think is a veryimportant reminder.We are in this effort asking of the President that he give a report tothe Congress prior to the conclusion of any strategic arms reduction treatyjust exactly how we intend as a Nation to make certain that the securityof the United States is improved by that treaty, which is to say we areasking that we be mindful of the fact that simply reducing arms withouthaving clearly thought about what our strategy will be is important beforewe ever go to that treaty.We have to know whether or not Congress is prepared to maintain certainforce structures, both offensive and defensive. We have to be concernedwith our capacity not only to retaliate and to survive a first strike butto limit damage in a way which requires that we pursue a defensive as wellas an offensive strategy, and the two must be coordinated.This report which the President is required to provide to the Congressprior to the conclusion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or an agreementof this kind is absolutely essential. In other words, what we are sayingis we have to have a very clear strategy before we go, we have to havea very clear strategy certainly before the Senate is asked to ratify sucha treaty, and the Senate must ask itself upon receiving that report fromthe President whether we are prepared to actually implement the steps necessaryto assure that our security will be enhanced by such a treaty rather thanin fact jeopardized.That is what this is all about. That is why the specific requirements inthe Presidential report are called for, not just alternative force posturesfor the United States under the agreement, not just the costs associatedwith acquiring each alternative force posture but also the deffensive,damage limitation potential as well as the survivability and retaliatoryoffensive potential of each force posture.Mr. President, I commend the majority leader and minority leader. I thinkthis is a brief, well-stated, and absolutely essential requirement forany intelligent planning in connection with the START Agreement in orderto assure that it will produce the results for which we hope.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the <T4>Record </T4>an article that appeared in the Washington Post by HenryKissinger, entitled ``START: A Dangerous Rush for Agreement.'' There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows: [S13MY8-684]{S5741}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 1988] </ITAG>[S13MY8-685]{S5741}START:A D<ITAG tagnum="74">START: A Dangerous Rush for Agreement </ITAG>[S13MY8-686]{S5741}(ByHenry <ITAG tagnum="71">(By Henry Kissinger) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">President Reagan has stated that he hopes the START agreement to reduceU.S. and Soviet strategic forces by 50 percent will be completed in timefor the summit at the end of May. There has been astonishingly little debateabout the impact of such an agreement on strategy, verifiability and foreignpolicy. A pause in the rush to agreement is needed to permit a nationaldebate while the treaty can still be reshaped. It is essential also toinsure the Congress will fund the measures that will be necessary to ensurethe survivability and strategic effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrentunder START conditions. Before America makes another arms control dealwith the Soviet Union, it must make a deal with itself. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For START is being negotiated in a conceptual vacuum. The United Stateshas not yet decided_or at least has not put forward_what strategic forcesit proposes to deploy under the START ceiling of 4,900 warheads in 1,600missiles and 1,100 nuclear weapons on aircraft. Or how it plans to verifySoviet observance of these limits. Yet the relative capability of U.S.strategic forces_or the perception of it_has been the key element in Westernsecurity policy for the entire postwar period. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Still, common sense permits certain projections, The United Stateswill almost certainly opt to retain 18 submarines out of the current 36,down from 41 in the 1970s. Since each Trident submarine has 24 missilescounted as having eight warheads each, this would place 3,456 warheadson submarines and leave 1,444 warheads to be distributed among land-basedmissiles. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the number of submarines is cut so drastically while the agreementleaves Soviet antisubmarine forces free to grow and modernize, the vulnerabilityof the U.S. residual submarine force must inevitably increase. This wouldbe especially true were a technological breakthrough to occur in antisubmarinewarfare. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The situation with respect to land-based missiles is more precariousstill. The Washington summit agreement reduces Soviet heavy missiles warheadsfrom 3,080 to 1,540. Though this is lauded as a great achievement, anyserious analysis shows that the survivability of the U.S. land-based forceafter the proposed reductions can be maintained at present levels onlyby a major_and expensive_modernization program. And the present level ofvulnerability already is considered dangerous by most experts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. land-based missiles now consist of 2,000 warheads on three typesof missiles: 500 highly accurate warheads on 50 MX missiles; 1,500 reasonablyaccurate warheads on 500 Minuteman III missiles and 500 inaccurate largewarheads on Minuteman II single-warhead missiles_the oldest in the U.S.arsenal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Retaining the most accurate and modern weapons_the MX and MinutemanIII_and scrapping the Minuteman II would be most cost effective and mostconsistent with a strategy of sparing civilian populations and concentratingon military targets. However, it would also produce the most vulnerableU.S. deployment. Indeed, such a START scheme would actually worsen thevulnerability of American silos. Today the Soviet Union has 3,090 SS-18warheads aimed at 1,000 U.S. silos, After START, assuming the United Statesretains its most effective weapons, the Soviets would have 1,540 warheadsaimed at 364 silos, thereby raising the ratio of warheads to silos from3.08:1 to 4.2:1. It is hard to argue that such a result would be a contributionto ``stability.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The cheapest way to maintain the existing ratio of Soviet warheadsto U.S. missiles would be to disperse U.S. targets by replacing a numberof Minuteman IIIs with three warheads for a three times larger number ofMinuteman IIs single warheads. The disadvantage is that Minuteman IIs haverelatively poor accuracies. They are most useful for a strategy of civiliandevastation and least suitable for a strategy concentrating on militarytargets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The wisest course would be to develop a new single-warhead missileto combine the advantages for discriminating targeting and dispersal forsurvivability. It could be placed into a silo or preferably be made mobileor both. But the best course is also the most expensive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But no agreement on the composition of the strategic forces existseither within the executive branch or between the administration and Congress.For budgetary reasons the administration has all but shelved the Midgetman,the proposed single-warhead mobile missile. The Senate Armed Services Committeehas approved a mobile Minuteman III; the House Armed Services Committeehas opted for the Midgetman in principle but allocated insufficient funds.There are drawing board schemes to reduce the number of missiles on Tridentsubmarines from 24 to 16, thus increasing the number of submarines by athird and complicating the tasks of Soviet antisubmarine warfare. But nobodyhas advanced a concept for how to pay for the additional submarines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The administration therefore needs to make sure that Congress willin fact fund the necessary programs. At a minimum, there should be an executive-legislativesummit in which the administration outlines how it proposes to composepost-START U.S. strategic forces and congressional leaders agree to fundthe programs needed to improve their survivability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A pause in the rush to agreement also would permit closer examinationof verification in the crucible of the realities that would be createdby the new agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A verification system would have to be able to determine whether thepermitted numbers of 6,000 warheads and 1,600 missiles have been exceeded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I know of no expert who believes that the margin of error with respectto counting the number of mobile intercontinental missiles can be smallerthan 25 percent. Yet the two newest Soviet missiles are mobile: the SS-25is land mobile and the SS-24 is rail mobile.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The problem of counting Soviet missiles produced but never deployedis even more intractable. In the negotiations for the recently concludedINF agreement, the Soviet Union revealed that it had produced 50 percentmore medium-range weapons than it had deployed. In START, unlike INF, theproduction lines for strategic weapons would remain open.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If verification of the total number of missiles is difficult, determiningthe number of warheads could turn into a nightmare. Since it is impossibleto establish from a satellite how many entry vehicles a missile carries,certain mechanical ``counting rules'' have been established over the years.Every multiple-warhead missile was assumed to have the maximum number ofreentry vehicles that have been tested on that missile even if it carriedfewer reentry vehicles when actually deployed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Washington summit jettisoned that principle. America's new submarine-launchedmissile, the D-5, has been tested with 10 warheads. Nevertheless, to maintaina minimum number of submarines the United States chose to equip each D-5missile with eight reentry vehicles. In return the Soviets were permittedto count the reentry vehicles on their submarine-launched missile, theSSN-23, at four, even though it had been tested in an 8-to-10 warhead version.Similar discrepancies exist with respect to the Soviet heavy ICBM, theSS-18. The number of reentry vehicles assigned to missiles has become asubject of negotiations, not of verifiable testing data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Complex schemes_probably too complex for day-to-day use_for the on-siteinspection of deployed warheads are being discussed, but no arrangementcould prevent the Soviet Union from producing warheads with the largestnumber of reentry vehicles already tested, stockpiling them and installingthem in times of crisis or perhaps even between inspections. We must takecare lest on-site inspection works more to tranquilize than to reassure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Before an agreement is signed, the public and Congress need to understandprecisely the scope and limits of verification. A number of questions mustbe answered, such as:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) What confidence do we have in the verification scheme for limitationsubject to the START agreement?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) What is the cumulative risk if the verification system is understress and not carried out under ideal laboratory conditions?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) By how much and in what ways does on-site inspection improve onnational technical means, such as satellites?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) How will the verification system be integrated into American decision-makingat the highest levels?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) What is the United States prepared to do in case of violations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) What level of violation would threaten free-world security andwhy?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the end the START process will mark another major step away fromthe deterrent strategy pursued for the entire postwar period. It will beanother step toward stripping away the legitimacy of nuclear weapons withoutlinking that process to the vital need to reduce the conventional armsthreat either by building conventional forces or via conventional armscontrol. The growth of Soviet strategic forces in the mid-'70s coincidedwith making nuclear strategy a domestic issue in most democracies. As aresult Western nuclear strategy has progressively become separated fromrational objectives. Accurate warheads and missile defenses have all beenvilified; mass destruction of civilian targets has been emphasized as ifonly the prospect of a holocaust would preserve peace. These evasions leavethe democracies increasingly suspended between Armageddon and surrender.The prospective START agreement will inevitably exacerbate this incoherence,accelerating abdication from the weapons on which Western strategy is basedwithout producing an alternative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is self-evident that the dismantling of American medium-range weaponsin Europe, followed by a 50 percent cut in the strategic forces of theUnited States, must have some impact on Western strategy. What targetsthat once were covered will be left unattended under the new agreement?What happens to the four submarines ``assigned'' to the North AtlanticTreaty Organization when the total number of submarines on station in theAtlantic has shrunk to around six? How does NATO visualize the relationshipbetween nuclear and conventional defense in both strategy and arms control?How do we propose to link these processes?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One way to improve the survivability of strategic forces would beto build a strategic defense at least for missile sites. Yet in order toachieve START the administration has agreed to a nine-year deployment banextending into the third presidential term after the Reagan administration.It is in the process of agreeing to unspecified restrictions on testing.If history is any guide, these restrictions are likely to atrophy the program,since no deployment ban or testing restrictions have ever been abandonedby the United States. If the administration is willing to accept that outcome,it should obtain a higher price, for example, scrapping all the Sovietheavy missiles. If, however, the administration seriously intends to proceedwith the Strategic Defense Initiative, it should put before an executive-legislativesummit a strategic rationale and a program and budget levels for the nextdecade. If it fudges the issue, it will inherit the disadvantages of everycourse of action: de facto abandonment of SDI for no equivalent concession.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Reductions'' and ``ending the nuclear threat'' have become catchwordsin the domestic debate of all NATO countries. But the Western alliancerequires a strategy, not a slogan. START should not proceed further untilthe American people and our allies have been told with some precision wherethis process is leading.</ITAG>Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.[S13MY8-687]{S5742}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE </T4>addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.[S13MY8-688]{S5743}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE. </T4>Mr. President, I have just seen a copy of the proposedamendment. I would like to make one of two observations with respect toit. I commend both the Democratic leader and the Republican leader forbringing this to the floor. I think it is very important that we have anopportunity to interact with the administration before they sign an agreementrather than attempt to do so after such agreement is signed.One thing occurs to me in connection with a proposed START agreement. Ithink that is the kind of thing that is causing a great many of us oneor two second thoughts about the INF. It is not so much what INF does ordoes not do as what it sets in motion and where it will lead. One thingthat the pending amendment really does not say but I think is implied bythe amendment is there is linkage between different kinds of force systems,INF, MX, strategic, strategic balance, or lack thereof affects conventionalforces.I read both the finding section of this amendment, and the Presidentialreport requirement of subsection B, and it appears to me that the reportrequired under subsection B of the amendment is somewhat broader than thefindings statements under subsection A. I commend the authors of the amendmentfor so doing because subsection A refers to a balance of strategic forces,and talks only about strategic forces. But I think everyone doing any workat all in following these negotiations understands that each of these affecta subsequent force structure. And we cannot talk simply about intermediateforces without looking at what balance is left with strategic forces norcan we talk about strategic forces in a vacuum without looking at how thatrelates to conventional forces.While the findings talk about stable balance of strategic forces, the reportrequires a broader report to the Congress about alternative force postureswhich I understand would include the remaining intermediate forces, thetactical forces, strategic forces, and conventional forces.So we are not talking about strategic balance versus the Soviet strategicforces alone. We are talking about how such an agreement would affect thetotal force structure of the United States as compared to the total forcestructure of the opposing forces. And that implies also NATO and Warsawforces I believe because I think that is what many of us are concernedabout, that we might find ourselves with an elimination of intermediatenuclear forces, a drastic reduction in nuclear forces in START, and atthe same time no change in the balance on conventional forces which everyoneconcedes are substantially in favor of the Soviet Union and the WarsawPact.There is a linkage, whether we link the agreements or not. We certainlyhave to link in our own thinking the question of whether or not the resultantforce structure, after the effects of the agreement are felt, adequatelyprotects the defense and the security of the United States.I commend the Democratic leader and the Republican for calling for a reportthat tacitly recognizes that it is the force posture of the total forceson both sides that is the critical element in judging whether or not aproposed agreement is wise or not.There are some people who believe that we cannot link the discussions atall, but indeed we may not be able to get all of the agreements at once.But we cannot avoid the necessity of linking the results to the resultantforce posture.I hope that the movers of the amendment will join this Senator and manyothers in insisting that when such a report is sent to us it adequatelyreflects the administration's position with respect to total force postureson both sides.I so read the amendment. I commend the offerers of the amendment for bringingthis amendment to the floor at this time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?

Mr. President, I would like to address a question to all participantsin this particular debate.I in no way minimize the importance of the debate. I understand the strengthof the feeling that each of them has. On the other hand, I do not thinkit is any secret that under the unanimous-consent request we had agreedto some 2 days ago, a major issue included with five others for specialconsideration was to be one that had to do with the deployment of militaryassets and manpower for the interdiction of drugs into the United States,after, I think, a very fruitful and productive negotiation. Those who havebeen involved in that are prepared to go forward.My question is this: While we have been perfectly willing to lay asidethat place on the unanimous-consent agenda to allow other business to goforward, I get the distinct feeling that this debate on the floor is beingenjoyed so greatly by the people participating in it that there is a prospectof a lenghty debate.A practical concern is that a number of those who are involved in fashioningthe drug bill would very much like to conclude it today, and I doubt greatlythat we will be able to conclude the rest of the business. What I am askingthose who are interested in this matter is whether they would be willingto lay it aside so that we might take up the interdiction measure.[S13MY8-796]{S5750}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I say to the Senator from California that I understand and Ishare his concern. I understand his interest, which I also share, and thelegislation to which he referred.It is not this Senator's wish to prolong unnecessarily, in any sense ofthe word, the debate on this amendment or the one that Senator <T4>Byrd </T4>and I have just offered, in effect, in the nature of a substitute.I would only say that, in my judgment, the Senate disposed of the issueyesterday that has been brought to the floor by the Senator from Texas,and we have it up again today. I thought the Senate had disposed of itwhen the amendment of the Senator from Texas was ruled out of order bythe Chair, but he is back with another amendment. Indeed, it took 45 minutesfor this new amendment, which I tried to obtain a copy of but was not ableto obtain a copy of, for that amendment to be read.It is not the Senator's wish to detain the Senator from California or anyMember of the Senate from debating the issue of the involvement of ourmilitary with drugs and the necessary steps that I know he strongly favorsto help gain an additional partner for our country in the fight againstdrugs.Speaking for myself, I do not have any objection, if the Senator from Texaswould be willing to lay the whole matter aside, for the Senator's amendmentto proceed. There may be others who do. The Senator from Texas may objectto laying the Gramm amendment aside.[S13MY8-797]{S5750}WILSONMr. WILSON.

I say to the Senator from Colorado that we are really not farfrom being able to go to final passage. By that I mean that we have twoor three obstacles. One obstacle, the drug bill, was one of the biggestwe have, and it seems to me that we will be able to handle that by no laterthan 6 o'clock if we get this unanimous-consent agreement.Another was a jurisdictional kind of dialog we have had with the AppropriationsCommittee, and we hope we are about to work that out.The third is this coal amendment right now, and it seems to me that thecoal amendment is the most likely obstacle.Once we get those three worked out, if we do get those worked out, I thinkwe are ready to go to final passage.[S13MY8-815]{S5751}ARMSTRONGMr. ARMSTRONG. Is it the Senator's intention to go to final passage thisevening?[S13MY8-816]{S5751}NUNNMr. NUNN. As the manager, my recommendation to the leadership would beif we can see we can finish this bill tonight, to continue. If we get toa point where it is apparent it is not, I do not care to hold our colleaguesin unless it is for the purpose of finishing the bill.Right now I believe we can finish the bill tonight.[S13MY8-817]{S5751}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, could I pose afurther question to follow up the question asked by the Senator from Colorado?There is no problem with this Senator. I am going to be here until. Itdoes not make any difference to me what happens.I do know that there are a great number of Senators on both sides of theaisle who are being inconvenienced and many of them have talked with meabout it.I am wondering if to satisfy this proposition we could not get a unanimousconsent right now for final passage of this bill sometime Monday afernoonor Monday evening and would that not satisfy the problem that some of ushave had with regard to running beyond Monday of next week on this bill?[S13MY8-818]{S5751}NUNNMr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Nebraska, first of all, I believe wecan finish tonight. Second, I believe it would be just as easy to get atime agreement to finish tonight as it will be Monday.I do not see we gain anything. Anyone, for instance, who has a problemwith the coal amendment, it seems to me, is going to have just a much reluctanceto agree to a time agreement for Monday. If the Senator or anyone else can secure a Monday final passage deadline,then that is something we ought to seriously consider and would seriouslyconsider.I just believe, based on what I know about the various amendments around,having a time agreement to finish at a certain time on Monday would bejust as hard as finishing the bill tonight.I would be satisfied if we have a time agreement for final passage on Mondayor if we have final passage tonight with a time agreement or if we justplow on through.I just do not believe we are going to be able to get a time <ITAG tagnum="80">agreement for Monday any easier than tonight.</ITAG>[S13MY8-819]{S5751}SYMMSMr. SYMMS.

Mr. President, I rise to urge adoption of the amendment whichI offer on behalf of myself and Senators <T4>Nunn, Warner, DeConcini, D'Amato, Graham, Thurmond, Chiles, Dole, Sasser,Boschwitz, Dixon, Bentsen, Trible, Durenberger, </T4>and <T4>Gramm.</T4>Mr. President, let me begin by giving credit where it is due to those whohave participated in a strenuous and extensive negotiation not only witheach other but with officials of the Department of Defense and the Departmentof Justice. We are offering today legislation that gives the promise notof ending the tragedy of drugs in America but one that can make a verysignificant improvement in our ability to combat that problem.I fully expect that later in this session as part of a comprehensive effortby the Congress we will submit legislation dealing with the necessity ofcurtailing demand.But let me just say, Mr. President, that it is simplistic and misses asignificant point to simply announce that were there not the demand, notthe market for drugs in America, there would be no problem.There is necessarily a very definite and a tragic relationship betweenthe flood of drugs that is available in this Nation and the increasingaddiction, because that flood of drugs not only feeds an appetite, butit is used to create a market. Unhappily, tragically, the market for thesedrugs are the most vulnerable in our society_the youngest, the poorest,the most susceptible. And they are found not just in the inner city orin the suburbs, but also in rural areas. They are found in virtually everyeconomic stratum of our society. The one distinguishing characteristicthey have is that they are young.I will tell you that I am not terribly_I am saddened_but not terribly eagerto spend time on someone who is 40 years old who has decided that he isgoing to do something dangerous with his health. I am concerned about children_9,10, 11 year old children.What we are saying, Mr. President, is that local law enforcement in thisNation is overwhelmed. There is a reason that street cops and policy chiefsand sheriffs are the ones urging that we do something to curtail demandby education, by prevention, by treatment and rehabilitation. It is becausethey are in the business of interdicting the supply, trying to stop itfrom ever reaching the market_the market that exists on school groundsand play grounds.Mr. President, in order to make their job far less dangerous, far lesschallenging, and far less expensive to the taxpayer, we are bound and determinedto do what we can to interdict the supply of drugs beyond the borders ofthe United States. Why? For the very simple reason that for every dollarthat we expend on interdiction of supply beyond the borders of the UnitedStates, we have better than doubled the return for that same dollar investedin local law enforcement efforts which, Mr. President, is no pejorativecommentary on the local law enforcement. To the contrary, it is, rather,a commentary on the overwhelming odds that are faced by police departmentsand sheriff departments all across this land once they are compelled todeal with this tragedy at retail.What we are attempting to do here is to deploy the assets of the military,very considerable assets, in particular having to do with a capabilityfor surveillance, for detection, for tracking of maritime vessels and aircraftby which the great majority of drug smuggling into the United States isaccomplished. And it is for that reason that this amendment is before us.The amendment contains findings by the Congress, specifically that thetransport of drugs and contraband is, in fact, a menace to national security.It is a serious threat, Mr. President.The chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the cosponsor of thisamendment spends a great deal of time, as do I and some of the others onthis floor, worrying about other risks to national security. But to usethe eloquent phrase that he employed the other day, we are dealing withnothing less than chemical warfare against the youth of this Nation, againstthe future leadership of America.So it is appropriate that Congress find that the drug traffic constitutesa threat to national security and that a mission of the Armed Forces ofthe United States shall be to assist Federal law enforcement agencies responsiblefor the interdiction of those drugs entering the United States by aircraftor vessel.This will provide guidelines to the military departments. It will requirethat the President submit to the Congress a plan that will best integrateand employ the military and civilian assets at our command. It expressesthe sense of the Senate that the Department of Defense has unique capabilities,experience and equipment to participate in the kind of detection that isnecessary if we are to stop drugs before they gain entrance to our Nation,stop them beyond our borders.It looks to the expertise which the military holds by virtue of their experienceand equipment in command, control and communications. It provides for airborneradar coverage, particularly of the southwestern border, until such timeas aerostats can be employed and put in place there because of the specialvulnerability of that very porous, very mountainous stretch of terrain.It requires that the military loan adequate rotor and fixed wing aircraftto engage in the pursuit and surveillance of suspected aerial smugglers.It permits the use of military pesonnel who have been cross-sworn by theCoast Guard to have the same law enforcement abilities beyond the bordersof the United States_not within, but beyond_as may be necessary in orderto assist the Coast Guard and other law enforcement activities primarilyemployed in the interdiction of drugs from achieving their mission.Mr. President, there was great debate as to whether or not we should involvethe military. We have had that debate before. Indeed, there are some convertsto the cause. At one time some time ago, I thought it inappropriate thatthe military be involved, that we should, rather simply, give greater assetsto the civilian law enforcement agencies charged with that primary responsibility.Mr. President, what has happened in the interval is that the drug trafficinto the United States has reached floodtide. The problem has reached crisisproportions and it is necessary for us to deal with it in a timely fashion.We cannot ignore it. We cannot ignore the availability of the assets atour command.So let me simply give to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee mysincere thanks for his cooperation, and to Senator <T4>DeConcini,</T4> Senator <T4>D'Amato,</T4> and Senator <T4>Graham,</T4> who were central to these negotiations, who worked longand hard hours to convince the Department of Defense.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.[S13MY8-838]{S5753}WILSONMr. WILSON. I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended by 2 minutes.[S13MY8-839]{S5753}DOLEMr. DOLE. I cannot do that.

Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent thatSenator <T4>Gramm </T4>be added as an original cosponsor.The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Graham</T4>). Without objection, it is so ordered.[S13MY8-844]{S5754}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to pay a special thanks to a numberof our colleagues who have worked together in a truly bipartisan spiritand put petty partisan politics aside. I am talking about Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>Senator <T4>Wilson, </T4>Senator <T4>Bob Graham, </T4>Senator <T4>DeConcini, </T4>Senator <T4>Dixon, </T4>and our minority leader, Senator <T4>Dole, </T4>and our staffs who worked well into the night to 2 o'clockand 3 o'clock in the morning.Mr. President, it seems to me, for the first time we can truly say thatthe Congress of the United States is beginning to look to do the businessof the people in involving and prioritizing our resources in this war againstdrugs.Some people say, ``Well, this is not going to solve the whole problem.''And they are right. But we are never going to mobilize the people and letthem know that we are serious if we do not do our job. And the militaryhas a role.I suggest that we have achieved the proper balance here. We may have tofine-tune this law, but why not use the technical resources, the radarsystems, the detection devices that we have to help us track down thosemore than 20,000 planes carrying cargoes of death and destruction intoour communities? People have a right to know why and we are answering.We are saying, ``Yes, it is overdue.''Yes, the institutions are unhappy. The defense people are not doing cartwheelsover this. They are going to be dragged to the altar, but they have acceptedthe mission.We are well on our way to undertaking a very important first part, to saythat we are going to see to it that we make a real statement as it relatesto interdiction.Second, Mr. President, I believe that in the fullness of time within thislegislative session, we will be able to undertake the other parts of thatequation, to see to it that we have good, tough law enforcement and givethose people the kinds of resources necessary and, above all, to energizethis country to understand that it is going to take a total people commitment.It is going to take us giving resources to rehabilitation so that you donot have addicts who want help being told to come back 2 months from now,3 months from now, 4 months from now. And it is going to take an educationalrequirement that we say in all of our school districts, in all of our institutions,we are going to teach self-worth to our youngsters, that they are important,that they have self-esteem, and that they care about themselves and others.Mr. President, this is a good beginning in terms of looking to the daywhen we can say we have truly achieved a drug-free America.Mr. President, in summary, this amendment is offered in a bipartisan spirit.It has the support of the President. It has the support of the DefenseDepartment. Many Senators from both sides of the aisle have worked hardand in a cooperative manner to craft this amendment_including Senators<T4>Nunn, Wilson, DeConcini, Stevens, Dole, Dixon, Graham, Boschwitz, Gramm,Thurmond, Warner, and Kassebaum. </T4>We are taking several very significant steps with this amendment: First, giving to the military the power of arrest and the power to detect,locate, pursue, search, and seize ships and planes carrying drugs intothe United States_in effect, to enforce antidrug laws outside the UnitedStates; Second, giving the military a drug fighting mission for the first time;Third, involving the Defense Department directly in the establishment ofthe most sophisticated antidrug radar system possible. This includes theintegration of the Nation's command, control, communications, and intelligenceassets dedicated to the interdiction of illegal drugs; Fourth, requiring the President to dedicate significantly more radar-planeflying hours to drug interdiction, make additional helicopters and pursuitplanes available to the Customs Service and Coast Guard, and to use DefenseDepartment planes and monitoring and communications equipment more fullyto track drug smugglers until civilian drug enforcement agencies can apprehendthem; and Fifth, creating an enhanced drug interdiction and enforcement program forthe National Guard. This includes authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide additionalfunds to State Governors for that purpose. It also requires the Presidentto submit a report in 90 days on the potential effectiveness of using theNational Guard and the Reserves for drug interdiction efforts. I expectthat this report will address the particular problems my own State of NewYork faces with smuggling in cargo containers, at the airports, and otherareas. [S13MY8-845]{S5754}specifics <ITAG tagnum="89">specifics regarding arrest power </ITAG>With this amendment, for the first time, the Senate is going to pass legislationpermitting the military to arrest drug smugglers outside the United States.We are giving the power of arrest to Armed Forces personnel assigned toduty on Navy ships who have been designated for that purpose by the CoastGuard. [S13MY8-846]{S5754}additional<ITAG tagnum="89">additional airborne radar coverage </ITAG>We also require the President to increase the number of radar-plane flyinghours devoted to drug interdiction. We do not set a specific figure, butthis is a critical requirement, and we expect it to be complied with. Anincrease of 2,000 additional hours would not be unreasonable.To help the Coast Guard and Customs Service increase their ability to pursueand arrest drug smugglers, we also require the Defense Department to makeadditional helicopters and chase planes available to the Customs Serviceand the Coast Guard.Our amendment takes into very careful account of objections that were raisedwhen we debated this issue 2 years ago.Mr. President, in closing, let me add: interdiction alone will not winthis war. We must reduce demand dramatically through effective prevention,rehabilitation, ``zero tolerance'' and other programs.But we must have much stronger interdiction as well. Despite record seizuresof drugs. The price of cocaine on our streets has been dropping, becausethose seizures have failed to reduce the supply.Two years ago, Senators asked how an interdiction program involving themilitary would work.This year, we have provided one answer. The program we are proposing canbe implemented. It will increase the pressure on the drug smugglers. Itrepresents a meaningful commitment of our national will. It involves themilitary directly in the war on drugs. It says the United States of Americais prepared to defend itself against the greatest threat to the healthand well-being of its people that exists today.We must take this step. The people of this Nation are fed up with the failureto wage a real war on drugs. They will no longer tolerate watching theirpolice officers murdered, while the drug gangs grow more powerful. Theyare demanding that we act against the smuggling of cocaine and heroin thatare killing the children of this country and destroying our domestic tranquillity.I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment by an overwhelming margin.I yield back the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-847]{S5754}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has 10 minutes on hisown time.[S13MY8-848]{S5754}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. Iwant to begin as other Senators have here, stating that this is an importantamendment. This whole bill, authorization legislation for the Departmentof Defense, is extremely important for our national security. Senator <T4>Wilson </T4>of California, Senator <T4>D'Amato, </T4>Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>Senator <T4>Warner </T4>and Senator <T4>Gramm </T4>of Texas now, and Senator <T4>Graham </T4>of Florida and a host, many other Senators, Senator <T4>Sasser </T4>and Senator <T4>Chiles </T4>of Florida_many, many people have put in a lot of timeon this effort.Mr. President, we have got a huge problem. I think that this Senate andI believe the House is addressing it. We are, indeed, attempting to forgewhat we would call a war, an assault on the drug problem in this country.The bill introduced by the Senator from New York, Mr. D'<T4>Amato </T4>and myself and now having 73 or maybe 74 cosponsors, attemptsto more in the direction of the supply as well as the demand side of thedrug problem.Along in that bill there is $90 million directly authorized for the DefenseDepartment to assist them in some of the assets that that bill envisions,of transferring from the military to the law enforcement agencies. Thissignificant legislation today has been crafted and shepharded through bythe distinguished chairman of the committee and the ranking member. Theyhave been willing to understand the problem, which they have understood,particularly the Senator from Georgia, before I got here. They realizedthat this drug problem is not going to go away and that we must make ita national priority, both on the demand side, in education, as well asthe supply side.So, here we have carefully drafted a compromise that involves the militarysignificantly in the area of interdiction; in the area of surveillance;and in the area of participating and assisting in the actual apprehension,under certain circumstances.This is new, Mr. President. And it is something that some people will raiseeyebrows at_some in the military_and I respect their strong feelings, thatthe defense of this country must be separate from the enforcement of ourcriminal penalties for violating the laws.I have had no trouble with that so-called theory, posse comitatus, a precedentthat we have operated under in this country for a long time, except now.We are in a dire emergency. We have reached, Mr. President, a period oftime in our history that drugs are becoming an enemy equal to any foreignenemy. As President Reagan said when he signed the drug bill, he was preparedto commit all resources of this country to rid the country of drugs.He has said many times that drug smuggling is as big an enemy to this countryas any foreign enemy, foreign country, would be, meaning that we are nowgoing to turn our attention as if we were at a war, where we had hot ammunitionsflying back and forth between different armies, navies, air forces, etcetera.So, we are, indeed, taking a monumental step here by directing and providingthe procedure where the President and the Defense Department are goingto get involved not just with the tips of their toes, not with just adviceand counsel, which they have done, by doing inventories of equipment thatmight be available, but getting involved with personnel; with heavy equipment,exerting the force of our military on the high seas, for instance; usingthe sophisticated equipment we have to detect ICBM's and other supersonicflying aircraft to zero in the drug smugglers in this country.That, to me, Mr. President, is the first real notice that this countryis giving that we may be at war, on the verge of war, because we talk aboutthat. The story I like to tell is that of the chiefs of police, Mr. Gates,in Los Angeles, when he testified before Senator <T4>Wilson</T4> and myself on testimony in California on the war on drugs2 years ago. He said: We have never been in a war on drugs. We never hada war on drugs in this country. He said, ``You guys, and us, too, in lawenforcement, talk about it all the time, but we have never been at war.You know why? Because when you are at war you commit your military assets,you educate the population to support the country's objective and thatis to conquer something or stop something from doing something detrimentalto your national security.''That is true. We have overused the word. Nobody wants to see the DefenseDepartment weakened. I believe that you can do a military number on thesmugglers of this Nation and also protect our national security. That iswhat this amendment is all about. That is what this debate is all about.And that is what is going to curb the amount of drugs that is coming here.That is not enough. This will not be enough. We may have to allocate moreresources in the future on the military side. And we may have to spendmore money here than we spent, both in defense and on the drug area ingeneral.One thing we have to do, Mr. President, is move toward the demand side.This does not do that but we have to talk about education, we have to talkabout research. Why are so many people willing to risk their lives andwilling to become completely degraded by the use of drugs? We all havean option why. But I think it is necessary for us to make it a nationalprominent priority to find out those answers and to find education programs,rehabilitation programs, deterrent programs that will put a curb to this.That is my hope, that this bill is going to pay attention to the interdictionand the detection and the apprehension on the high seas in particular;and that after this bill, Mr. President, we will turn toward the problemwithin our own society. And rightfully so. Foreign countries or some people, not American citizens, point the fingerat the United States and say: This is your problem because you people upthere are the users, the consumers. And, indeed, it is our problem andwe need to address it and we are. We are not running away from it. The President finally, in the budget for1989, has put in $250 million for education; $30 million more, I believethe figure is, than what was authorized by the 1986 omnibus drug bill.And the bill of Senator <T4>D'Amato </T4>and myself and 73 other Members, that we have introducedand cosponsored here, has an additional $350 million. I am not suggesting we throw money out the window for education. I am suggestingwe carefully craft a massive education program about what drugs are; whatthey do. Not just to the young of this country; what they do to the stockbrokers,to the professional people, to housewives and house-husbands; what theydo to military people who get involved; what they do to senior citizens.What it does to this Nation as to its productivity, as to its capabilityto operate and its structural substance as a nation. That is the challenge that we have, Mr. President, in the future. We aremeeting part of that challenge today with the Wilson, et al. amendment,by moving the military forcefully in this direction. I hope, Mr. President,by this action, the military will, as they always have in the past historyof this country, come forward with the renewed vigor that we have seenthem with when we have been in a hot war and come forward with the strategyof how to win this war and offer us their techniques, their expertise,to bring about a reduction and hopefully an end to this drug plague. Mr. President, in summary, the amendment that has been offered by Senators<T4>Nunn, D'Amato, Wilson, Warner, Dixon, Graham, </T4>and myself is agood plan for finally bringing the military into our antidrug effort ina responsible way. Like all compromises, this package does not containall of the things that I want or that the other sponsors of the amendmentmight want. But it does achieve one overriding objective of all of us:It gives the Department of Defense a new mission to help the civilian lawenforcement agencies fight the drug war. This amendment represents a significantstep toward bringing the Pentagon into the fray without jeopardizing combatreadiness; without turning them completely loose to make arrests and seizures;and without busting their budget. For all of these reasons and others,this amendment deserves the overwhelming support of the Senate.Mr. President, there is one special provision in the amendment that isof particular importance to this Senator and my colleagues who representStates along the southwest border. We have directed in the amendment thatadditional surveillance flight hours be dedicated to the southwest border,and, as part of the President's plan for using the National Guard in druginterdiction, the amendment requires that options for more fully utilizingthe Guard of five southwest border States be a part of this plan. Thiswill put Congress' weight behind using the National Guard along the southwestborder to help Customs and Border Patrol and the State and local law enforcementagencies combat the drug smuggler. This is something that Senator <T4>Wilson </T4>and I have been pushing for many years and I am delightedto see it in this amendment.Finally, Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the sponsors of this amendment,particularly Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>Senator <T4>Wilson, </T4>Senator <T4>D'Amato, </T4>and the others, who worked tirelessly to reach this compromise.All of these Senators have very deep and different convictions as to howwe can best use our resources in the military to fight the narcotics trafficker.Senator <T4>Nunn </T4>has shown great leadership both in handling this overallbill and this amendment and for sitting down with us to craft a compromisethat we all can live with. Senator <T4>Wilson </T4>and Senator <T4>D'Amato </T4>have been bulldogs on this issue and deserve great credit,as do Senators <T4>Warner, Graham </T4>of Florida, <T4>Dixon, </T4>and <T4>Stevens. </T4>Without this bipartisan spirit of cooperation, we wouldnot have the agreement that we now have.Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.So, Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from California; theSenator from New York; the Senator from Georgia, Senator <T4>Nunn; </T4>and Senator <T4>Warner</T4> of Virginia, and so many others; Senator <T4>Dixon</T4> of Illinois, who played a major part in bringing us wherewe are today so that we can finally see some positive steps.The distinguished Presiding Officer has been a very important influencein this effort for realizing what the problems are in a particular areathat has been just overrun, from what he tells me and in my own limitedexperience in the Southeast part of this country. And the senior Senatorfrom Florida as well. I have learned a great deal about the problem here.I have learned a great deal from my colleague who is as committed as anyoneis, but we need to pull together today to bring about a united effort,and I think that is what we have done here. I yield the remainder of my time back to the Senator from Georgia.[S13MY8-849]{S5756}NUNNMr. NUNN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-850]{S5756}NUNNMr. NUNN.

He used his full 10 minutes.[S13MY8-853]{S5756}NUNNMr. NUNN. I was about to thank him, but in that case.Mr. President, I do thank the Senator because he has been a champion oftrying to strengthen our drug enforcement since the day he arrived in theU.S. Senate. I have worked with him long and hard. We have not always agreedon the tactics or the exact legislation, but we have agreed on the approachand the goals. I thank him for his kind comments and congratulate him aspart of this effort.I also congratulate the Senator from California and the Senator from NewYork for their diligent efforts; the Senator from Virginia has been workingclosely with me as we try to put together something that really makes sensein the drug interdiction effort. Both Senators from Florida, the Senatorpresiding now and Senator <T4>Chiles,</T4> have been right at the forefront of this effort.I particularly want to thank the Presiding Officer for his diligence inhelping to put together this compromise.Mr. President, we spent many long hours in the last few days trying todevelop a proposal in the area of drug interdiction which is acceptableto all of us in the Senate. This amendment now before us is the resultof those deliberations.In arriving at this proposal, all sides have had to compromise to somedegree. I certainly have compromised my views in order to reach some conclusionin this area. The amendment does not have all that I would have preferred,or all that Senator <T4>Graham</T4> of Florida, Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>Senator<T4> Chiles, </T4>Senator<T4> Dixon, </T4>and Senator<T4> Sasser</T4> would have preferred. I am sure it does not have everythingSenators<T4> D'Amato, Wilson, </T4>and <T4>DeConcini</T4> would have preferred.However, I think we all can agree it is the most reasonable compromisewe can arrive at on this deliberation of this bill.Mr. President, I always had reservations about search, seizure, and arrestauthority for the military, both on philosophical and practical grounds.I suppose my philosophical grounds would weaken somewhat if I thought,practically speaking, that the military could really add appreciably tothe drug interdiction effort by making arrests.The truth of it is, Mr. President, that most of the military craft arenot aircraft suitable for making arrests, but rather for identificationpurposes. Most of the military's capability is directed today against thehigh-flying aircraft rather than the single-engine or twin-engine aircraftthat bring drugs into this country.Nevertheless, we are moving toward making the military more effective,and there are a number of things that I think they can do to be much moreeffective.I do not think the big payoff is going to be in the area of arrest or seizure.I do believe the big payoff, in terms of increased military effectivenessin interdiction, will be in the area of surveillance, in the area of commandcontrol and communication. This is what the military does every day. Thisis what the military does well, but they do not do it in respect to drugenforcement in any major way. The reason being, as I have already alludedto, they are directing most of their efforts against our potential adversariesin the world that would come in in highflying aircraft or very high-speedaircraft to deliver large megatonnage weapons against this country.That is the heart of the defense mission. Yet increasingly, the low-flyingaircraft are violating our airspace, coming in without flight plans, anddelivering drugs which are affecting adversely our society.I said the other day that I think we have a chemical war being waged againstthe United States. A large part of that chemical warfare is coming fromthose outside the country. We must also acknowledge, however, in all candor,that an awful lot of the drugs being consumed in this country are alsobeing produced in this country, whether it is marijuana being grown infields around the United States or whether it is chemicals that are beingproduced, like PCP, in laboratories in this country.I would like for everyone to understand that even if we closed off allthe borders, if we closed every border and did not let anybody in, no humanbeing, no ship, no plane, we isolated ourselves from the world, made surenobody penetrated the border_which is, of course, impossible, not desirable,and will never happen, but if we did that hypothetically_this country wouldstill have a drug problem because we grow a lot of the drugs in this country;we produce a lot of the drugs in this country. If we closed off all importeddrugs, we would still have an incentive for the production of chemicalswhich would probably increase greatly, and we would still see a great numberof fields of marijuana.So let no one believe that we are going to pass a piece of legislation,whatever it is, and solve the drug problem, but we can improve it. We canimprove our interdiction efforts, and that is what we are trying to do.This compromise amendment includes variations of proposals that Senators<T4>Warner, Graham, Chiles, Dixon,</T4> and others had planned to introducein our amendment to the defense bill. The first of those provisions dealswith the need for a clear designation of a lead agency in air and sea drugtraffic detection and surveillance. We have a piecemeal approach now withdivided jurisdiction, and what we believe is that we should have a leadagency in this important area.The big problem is not stopping a plane or a ship with drugs. The big problemin drug interdiction is knowing which ship to stop or which plane to stop.We cannot possibly stop every plane coming into this country without aflight plan or otherwise. We cannot possibly stop every ship coming intothis country for search no matter what we do with the military or domesticlaw enforcement.We have to do a much better job of knowing which ones to stop, and thatgets into surveillance, it gets into intelligence, and it gets into knowingwhich plane or ship carries the drugs in question.As lead agency, we mean that the agency has the authority to approve allactivities by any other agencies in the detection and monitoring arena,thus eliminating the lack of coordination and cooperation that has existedand continues to exist among our law enforcement agencies.The amendment requires that the President establish a single lead agencyfor detection and surveillance not later than 30 days after the enactmentof this act.The compromise also includes a clear statement that the Senate believesthe Defense Department has unique capabilities in detection and surveillance,and it directs the President to give priority consideration to these factorsin making his decision on a lead agency.In other words, Mr. President, we do not tell the President what to do,but we do give him some strong indication of the leaning we have and therecord, as far as the Department of Defense, and the potential the Departmentof Defense has to greatly increase our interdiction capability.On this point, I note that it is my view that the Department of Defense,by virtue of its expertise, capability, as well as function, should clearlybe the lead agency for purposes of detection and surveillance.I do not speak for the Senate as a whole on that point. The amendment speaksfor the Senate, if it passes. Nor do I speak for the other cosponsors,but that is my personal view.Currently, the Defense Department has the equipment, the training, andthe experience to effectively perform maritime and aerial surveillance.They already have in place a sophisticated and efficient command controland communications network for the detection of a military threat.Designating the Defense Department as lead agency would require the samenetwork to also detect all other national security threats to our bordersincluding drug smuggling.Mr. President, I believe it is important for us to recognize that as amatter not only of national security in the broad sense, but in the narrowsense of military threats, with the proliferation of nuclear knowledgein this country and abroad, all over the world, and with the proliferationof terrorism, we may find a time in the future a plane which today is carryingmarijuana may carry a weapon. So the military, in my opinion, will notbe wasting their efforts to begin to improve their capability against low-flyingaircraft. There is nothing that says that a low-flying aircraft that cancarry 2,000 pounds of marijuana would not carry a chemical weapon or evena biological weapon, God forbid, or a small nuclear weapon. There is nothingthat says that terrorists or other threats will not emerge in the future,and so I do not believe this will be in any way a wasted effort on thepart of the military. I think it is protection for possible future threats.During the course of negotiations and discussions yesterday on this compromiseamendment, several Senators on both sides of this issue, myself among them,met with Attorney General Meese and Secretary of Defense Carlucci. Althoughthey certainly did not bind themselves, nor did they bind the Presidenton this point, it was my impression that when we outlined our views asfar as the Department of Defense and its proper role, particularly thesurveillance role, those views met with a considerable degree of intereston the part of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense.I am not suggesting they approved these views, but I am suggesting thatI felt they were interested and were leaning in this direction.Mr. President, I will not take more time. I have a long statement. ButI do want to make one other point.Just this week I was pleased to note the additional support for this generalapproach from the White House Conference on Drugs. The Washington Postreported that in the draft of their final report they recommended thatthe Department of Defense control our Nation's drug detection assets onthe border. Given all the above, I am hopeful that the President will sharenot only my view but the view of numerous experts in this area as wellas what I hope will be the emerging view of the Attorney General as wellas the Secretary of Defense and designate once and for all the DefenseDepartment as the lead agency for detection and surveillance.This would not mean Defense would carry the whole burden. It would notmean that other agencies would not be involved. It would mean that somebodywould be in control. For a long time we have tried to have a drug czarin control of the whole effort. That is not part of this bill, but I suggestthat it is going to have to recur because we cannot have a lot of agenciesworking along the same lines with little or no coordination.Mr. President, the compromise amendment addresses what I believe to bean acceptable role for the military in the antidrug efforts of the FederalGovernment. We have a very carefully prescribed authority here for themilitary to make arrests under certain conditions where the transgressiontakes place outside the borders of the United States and where the militarypersonnel have been trained and where they have been cross-designated byappropriate law enforcement, Coast Guard officials to serve in the capacityof a Coast Guard authority under the existing law. So that is a carefullydrawn proposal.I do not pretend to suggest that this proposal or any other proposal wecan devise or draw up is going to end the problem of drugs in this country.I think we all know that the drug epidemic in this country is far pastthe stage where interdiction alone, whether it be by the Armed Forces,the Drug Enforcement Administration, or the Customs Service, can stop it.We have to find ways to convince literally hundreds of thousands of Americansthat they no longer should spend their dollars for illegal drugs. In otherwords, the biggest payoff that we can really get from investing our moneyas I view it is in the education area and in curbing demand. That is whatwe have to start doing much better than we are doing today. As long aswe have the people of this country in large numbers willing to pay a largeamount of money for drugs, somebody somehow is going to find a way to supplythose drugs, whether they are people from abroad or whether they are peoplein this country.So this is not a quick fix to the drug problem. I think there is no suchthing as a quick fix, and I do not think anyone should be under any illusionsregarding that. But I do believe this compromise is a step forward in onepart of the drug effort and that is interdiction. In the final analysis,there are two sources that we have to attack. One source is where the drugsare grown. We have to do a lot more in foreign policy, in diplomacy, inforeign aid, in making this a top priority in our relationship with othernations. We also have to do a lot more here at home where the drugs areconsumed. Those are the two sources that we have to deal with, one sourcerelates to demand, one source relates to supply. So interdiction can helpbut it is not going to solve the problem.I urge our colleagues to support this amendment because I think it is astep in the right direction.Mr. President, I doubt that there is a single Member of the Senate whois not unalterably opposed to the use of illicit drugs. I am confidentthat there is now a strong consensus in the Congress that we can no longertolerate an illicit drug trade that is destroying our young people andundermining our future as a nation.As such, I commend all of those Senators who have worked with us in thelast few days on the issue of the military's role in the drug war. I recognizeand appreciate their longstanding commitment to the struggle against drugabuse. I share their concerns and frustrations with this country's continuedfailure to win the war against drugs. We differ not on our perception ofthe problem but rather on what we see as the best and most effective solution.As a result, we have spent many long hours in the last few days tryingto develop a proposal in area of drug interdiction which is acceptableto all of us. The amendment now before us is the result of those <ITAG tagnum="80">deliberations. In arriving at this proposal, all sides have had tocompromise to some degree. The amendment does not have all that I or Senator</ITAG><T4>Graham </T4>or Senator <T4>Warner </T4>or Senator <T4>Chiles, </T4>Senator <T4>Dixon, </T4>Senator <T4>Sasser </T4>would have preferred. Nor, for that matter, does it containeverything that Senators <T4>D'Amato, Wilson, </T4>and <T4>DeConcini </T4>would have preferred. However, I think we all agreethat, at this point, it is the most reasonable compromise that we havebeen able to arrive at.I want to take a few moments to speak to some of the points of particularinterest to me in the compromise package.I have always opposed search, seizure, and arrest authority for the military,both on philosophical and practical grounds. I still believe that the ideaof giving the military arrest authority over civilians runs counter toa basic tenet of our system of government, one that bars the military fromarresting and searching its citizens and seizing their property in carryingout a civilian law enforcement role. I do not believe that the Americanpeople are ready to subject themselves to the authority of a military policeforce. I also do not believe that a military police force with power overcivilians is going to solve this country's drug problem.Moreover, in practical terms, I still have serious questions regardingthe potential cost of the added training in law enforcement and criminallaw that any broad grant of military law enforcement authority would require.We have no idea as to how much it would cost, who would provide it, orhow long it would require our military personnel to abandon their militaryduties.On this same point, I still wonder what will happen when and if a drugprosecution is brought on the basis of military seizures and arrests madeunder the authority of this amendment. How many of the military personnelmaking those arrests and seizures are going to be subpoenaed as witnesses?How many days or weeks of their military duties will be lost to their newduties in the criminal justice system? Do we really want to see our Navycommanders spend days and days as witnesses in drug cases? Do we want thiskind of unplanned and unforeseeable disruption in our military operations?I still have concern granting arrest authority to the military. In thespirit of compromise, however, I have agreed to a very specific grant oflaw enforcement authority to members of the Armed Forces in certain circumstances.This law enforcement authority can be exercised only outside the bordersof the United States and only by those members of the Armed Forces who:First, are assigned to duty on vessels of the Navy to which a member ofthe Coast Guard has been assigned under this section,Second, have been provided with appropriate training in the law enforcementfunctions of the Coast Guard, and Third, have been designated by an authorized member of the Coast Guardto perform the law enforcement functions of the Coast Guard. The law enforcement authority granted by the amendment is intended to belimited to that currently exercised by the Coast Guard on the high seas.This new authority is viewed as a extension of the current Coast GuardLedet Program which involves placing Coast Guard personnel aboard Navyships to interdict suspected drug traffickers and conduct searches, seizuresand arrests. The only change to current law proposed by this amendmentis that those Coast Guard Ledet [law enforcement detachment] teams arepermitted, pursuant to proper regulation of the Secretaries of Defenseand Transportation and the Attorney General, to cross-designate militarypersonnel on these naval vessels to assist them in performing their lawenforcement functions and, again, only beyond the borders of the UnitedStates. Nothing in this amendment permits any member of the Armed Forces to conductarrests, searches, and seizures within the borders of the United States.Nothing in this amendment permits members of the Armed Forces to conductarrests, searches, and seizures outside the United States unless they arecross-designated to assist the Coast Guard and are assigned to duty onNavy vessels. The compromise amendment also includes variations of proposals that Senators<T4>Warner</T4>, <T4>Graham</T4>, <T4>Chiles </T4>and I had planned to offer in our amendment to the Defensebill. The first of those provisions deals with the need for clear designationof a lead agency in air and sea drug traffic detection and surveillance.Our original amendment called for a substantial increase in the military'sparticipation in drug interdiction in areas that are compatible with traditionalmilitary activities. It did so by clearly designating the Defense Departmentas the lead agency for air and sea drug traffic detection at our borders.As lead agency, we mean that that agency has the authority to approve allactivities by any other agencies in the detection and monitoring arena_thuseliminating the lack of coordination and cooperation that now exists amongour law enforcement agencies. The compromise amendment recognizes the need for designation of a leadagency in the area of detection and surveillance but recognizes the roleof the President as head of the executive branch in making that decision.The amendment requires that the President establish a single lead agencyfor detection and    <ITAG tagnum="80">surveillance not later than 30 days after the enactment of this act.</ITAG>The compromise amendment also includes a clear statement that the Senatebelieves that the Department of Defense has unique capabilities in detectionand surveillance and directs the President to give ``priority consideration''to these factors in making his decision on a lead agency.On this point, I note that it is my view that the Department of Defense,by virtue of expertise, capability, as well as function, should clearlybe the ``lead agency'' for purposes of detection and surveillance. Currently,the Defense Department has the equipment, training and experience to effectivelyperform maritime and aerial surveillance. They already have in place asophisticated and efficient command, control and communications networkfor the detection of a military threat. Designating the Defense Departmentas lead agency would merely require that same network to also detect allother national security threats to our borders_including the drug smuggler.During the course of our negotiations and discussions yesterday on thiscompromise amendment, several Senators on both sides of this issue, myselfamong them, met with Attorney General Meese and Secretary of Defense Carlucci.During that meeting, they expressed the view that the lead agency decisionshould be an executive branch decision, a view which we agreed to and isincluded in this amendment.During that same meeting, it was my impression that both the Attorney Generaland the Secretary of Defense felt that the Department of Defense shouldbe designated the lead agency for detection and surveillance and that theyfully expected that to be the decision of the executive branch, shouldthe amendment be enacted.Directly related to the lead agency issue is the issue of effective integrationof command, control, communications and intelligence [C-3I] assets in druginterdiction. Building on language in our original amendment, the compromiserequires the President to submit a plan to Congress, 90 days after enactment,for the integration of this network by the Department of Defense. Thisis to be followed, within 120 days, by a plan for assignment of operatingthis network.In my view, this amendment's provisions on the lead agency and the C-3Iissues, if complied with in form and in spirit, will have the biggest andmost significant positive impact on the drug <ITAG tagnum="80">enforcement effort of any of the other provisions in the amendment.</ITAG>Hearings I chaired last year before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigationsshowed that we now have three different air forces doing radar surveillanceat our borders. One is run by the Department of Defense and searches forhostile military threats. As a general rule, the Department does not trackor monitor low, slow flying drug aircraft or follow vessels that do nothave a distinctly military profile. The other two air forces are run bythe Customs Service and the Coast Guard, utilizing loaned or decommissioneddefense assets, and looking for drug smugglers. If this were not bad enough,it is my understanding that recent proposals would add two more air forces_oneto the DEA and the other to State.During the same hearings, we also learned that we are creating a new, nationwide,C-31 network that will duplicate, to a large degree, the current systemused by the Air Force and the FAA. This new system is expected to commandand control the respective drug detection and monitoring assets of theCustoms Service and the Coast Guard. In the maritime arena, the duplication and redundancy of detection andcommand and control systems are similar. We have Maritime Defense Zonesfor the Navy, Coast Guard command centers, U.S. Customs Service Blue LightningCommand Centers and a coastal drug defense radar network that some expertsbelieve works no better than a Boy Scout with a pair of binoculars.Obviously, such a system is not an efficient way to run a drug skirmish,let alone a drug war. Much of the fault for such a situation rests withthe fact that a clear delineation of mission and lead agency authorityin the drug war has never been established. Congress has long consideredsuch a designation to be an important step in resolving the inter-agencyconflicts which have hampered Federal efforts for decades. In 1986, I sponsoredan amendment to the Defense Authorization Act which required that the Presidentsubmit to Congress a comprehensive program delineating a clear divisionof authority in interdiction and enforcement efforts among all Federalagencies involved in those efforts.The response that we received last May came as no surprise to those ofus who have monitored the President's Drug Policy Board for the last fewyears. The Policy Board directive told us that 14 agencies are in charge,though none have clear or exclusive authority in any specific area. Theproblems of multiple air forces, multiple radar networks, multiple command,communication, and control networks and multiple missions were never addressed.I believe this amendment will finally address the expensive and inefficientduplication of efforts which now exist in the <ITAG tagnum="80">detection arena. In my view, the Defense Department has the assets,training and experience to effectively perform maritime and aerial surveillance.By adding to their current mission the requirement to detect the drug smuggler,we would minimally effect readiness, provide substantial training benefits,and free the Customs Service and Coast Guard to devote their limited resourcesto their more traditional law enforcement activities. </ITAG>During our hearings, support for such a proposal came from almost everyexpert we heard from including the General Accounting Office, the Officeof Technology Assessment and even the former special consultant to theCommissioner of Customs on Tactical Interdiction. Maj. Gen. Stephen Olmstead,Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug Policy and Enforcement,saw a real advantage to a combined system both from a national defenseand drug enforcement point of view. Maj. Gen. Buford Lary, Commander ofthe First Air Force, Tactical Air Command, who has the responsibility forthe strategic defense of the lower 48 States, including Norad, also agreedwith the concept of a combined system_especially if co-located at the alreadyexisting Norad facilities. Just this week, I was pleased to note additional support for this proposalfrom the White House Conference on Drugs. The Washington Post reportedthat in that draft of their final report, they recommended that the Departmentof Defense control our Nation's drug detection assets on the border. Given all of the above, I am hopeful that the President will share, notonly my view, but the view of numerous experts in this area as well ashis own Attorney General and Secretary of Defense, and designate, onceand for all, the Defense Department as the lead agency for detection andsurveillance. That decision would probably be the single most importantlegacy of this administration's 8-year battle in drug interdiction. Finally, the compromise amendment responds to the urgings of many Governorsand law enforcement officials for a greater role by our National Guardin the war on drugs. The amendment recognizes the Guard's former contributionsto the fight against narcotics and supports their further activities withFederal assistance. Currently, the National Guard, when not on Federal status, may performlaw enforement duties at the direction of the State Governor. Many Stateshave effectively used their Guard in this capacity for crop eradication,surveillance, and other law enforcement activities. States such as Georgiaand Florida have been pace-setters under the leadership of their Governorsin utilizing the Guard for interdiction purposes. However, as a practical matter, since the States must pay for these activitieswith State funds, these opportunities for such Guard use have been quitelimited. This amendment provides $60 million to assist the Governors in carryingout this drug enforcement functions. This figure is based upon discussionwith the Defense Department, the National Guard Bureau, and State and localofficials. It appears to be a sufficient amount to cover the types of programsthat can effectively utilize the Guard in drug enforcement activities.Mr. President, the compromise amendment addresses what I believe to bean acceptable role for the military in the antidrug efforts of the FederalGovernment. I do not pretend to suggest that it will end the plague ofdrugs currently facing our country. I think we all know that the drug epidemicin this country is far past the stage where interdiction alone_whetherit be by the Armed Forces, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or theCustoms Service_can stop it. We have to find ways to convince literallyhundreds of thousands of Americans that they are no longer willing to spendtheir dollars for illegal drugs. Unless we do that, I fear we are goingto have the drug problem with us for a long time to come. In that context,we must beware of the quick ``fixes'' that extend the drug problems.Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.[S13MY8-854]{S5759}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, of all the problems facing America today, noneis more pressing or more of a threat than the illegal drug problem.Nothing since the conflict between the States, in my view, is a greaterthreat to our society and what it stands for than the conflict that permeatesthe very fiber of our society today, the illegal drug malaise.The amendment being offered now is worthy of our support and I urge itsadoption.It is a long way from a cure-all. It is only a beginning of meaningfulFederal action and others must follow if we are to meet and defeat theillegal drug trade and its perpetrators.I have been hesitant about the role of the military in the war on drugs.This is not the military's ``cup of tea'' and there is no question thatwith this action we burden our military with responsibilities they hadnever expected or trained for. We evidently have no other choice.I believe this measure has been drafted in such a fashion that is far betterand more workable than the House proposal and in conference with that bodyas the Defense authorization bill that will spell out the final draft ofthis provision, I pledge as one conferee I will hold fast in insistingon the principle of the Senate version.Like any war, we are all in this together and I warn against any feelingthat with the passage of this amendment we have solved the problem.Essentially, all we are doing is declaring war. The winning of that warwill depend primarily upon what followup and follow-on actions we take.This is an important step in the right direction.[S13MY8-855]{S5760}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager I allocate 7 minutesto the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator <T4>Graham.</T4>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>DeConcini</T4>). The Senator from Florida is recognized.[S13MY8-856]{S5760}GRAHAMMr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. It has been stated the most fundamentalhuman folly is to forget what it is you are trying to accomplish. I believethat that fundamental human folly has been repeated time afer time aftertime in this issue_the issue of the appropriate role of the military indealing with the enormous amount of drugs coming into the United States.The fundamental error has been that we have defined this as a drug problemand therefore a law enforcement problem.My assessment is that the problem is not with the cargo, as lethal as thatcargo is. The problem, Mr. President, is the carrier. Over 50 times a day,based on the best estimates of law enforcement officials across the land,an unidentified, illicit plane or boat lands somewhere in the United Statesand off-loads drugs. As the distinguished Senator from Georgia has indicated,that same plane or that same boat could have been offloading any othercommodity_terrorists, chemical bombs, nuclear devices. Are we going tohave to wait until we see a city ravaged by a nuclear attack or a communitywiped out by a chemical weapon brought in by that same clandestine boator plane that today is bringing in the other form of chemical weapon whichis destroying our society until we decide that this is a national securitythreat? Because it is the carrier that is the threat to our Nation.Second, once the problem is defined as being the carrier, then I believethe appropriate role of the military becomes clear, and that is to applythe resources that the military has most at hand in order to deal withthat carrier. What are those resources? They are the tremendous capabilitiesthat we have today to identify, to surveil, to detect high speed, highaltitude aircraft and to augment those to give us the same capability toidentify carriers who are coming at lower levels including on the sea itselfand at slower speeds.It is ironic that we have debated hours in the last week the question ofwhether we should spend billions of dollars to erect in the decades intothe future a space-based shield against ballistic missiles while we haveleft our borders wide open to the Cessna 172 that is invading us at thisvery hour at 500 feet and 150 miles an hour.It is ironic that we have been so focused on the future high technologythreat that we have forgotten today the low technology threat. The roleof the military which can make the greatest difference in protecting Americais to apply its detection and surveilllance capabilities from sea to thestratosphere to protect our Nation.Mr. President, I would like to make a third point, that is, a cautionarynote. I met earlier today with a former assistant district attorney forthe southern district of Florida which is probably the most active districtin America in terms of prosecuting drug-related offenses. I showed himthe amendment. I said ``What do you think about this amendment?'' His answerwas ``It won't do much good.'' I said ``Why?'' He said ``It won't do muchgood because we already are arresting more people than we are able to effectivelyprosecute. We already are prosecuting more people than we are able to effectivelyincarcerate.'' And if we are going to have a balanced program directedat the supply side of this problem, we have to have a balanced criminaljustice system which means we have to have strength which is commensurateat every level of our Federal criminal justice effort. He also said dealingwith the supply side of the problem is only dealing with the easier side.The really tough problems are in how to suppress this enormous appetitewhich Americans have for the use of these illicit drugs.So the cautionary note is while I believe that all of those who have beeninvolved for years in shaping an appropriate response for the militaryhave made a significant contribution to America's war against drugs, letus not feel that we have just declared victory over drugs. This is justa chapter in a long book. We are going to be called upon to see that wehave effective strength in each of the chains of a criminal justice systemto repress the supply, we are going to be called upon to be much more creativeand innovative, we as 240 million Americans, to understand what are thecauses of this appetite and what are the ways in which we can divert theappetite which today is taking the form of a destructive use of illicit,controlled substances toward more socially acceptable ways in which peoplecan deal with their personal problems. Those, Mr. President, are the challenges that lie ahead of us. For today,I believe we can say to the people of America that we have taken a steptoward dealing with an enormous social challenge to the very fabric ofAmerica. But it is just that, a step. We still have before us the challenge of atotally comprehensive American war against an enemy, which is an enemywhich in a way is more pernicious than any foreign adversary with the capacityto destroy the character of this great Nation. It is our challenge to see that that does not happen. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to commend all of my colleagues who haveworked so diligently in this behalf, and who will continue to work to seethat the full war is won.

[S13MY8-859]{S5760}GLENNMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I know when I see a steamroller rolling downthe road, and I know that when all of this furor is done today I will havedone little by raising some questions about this important issue. But whatwe have needed for some time is a coordinated drug program.We spend $1.4 billion right now. We spend $1.4 billion on interdictionright now, and with this bill we are saying, well, we are not providingenough money. We do not have guts enough to really do that, but we aresaying you can use an existing $60 million if you want to in addition tothat $1.4 billion and we think that is going to solve the problem. Thatis absolutely ludicrous.Here we are proposing to use the military that already has our worldwidedefense posture and deployment to worry about. We also have 35 percentof our drug budget currently going into interdiction.As the distinguished Senator from Florida just said, we have no prosecution,no lockups; we have nothing to follow up on this except here we are ina great hysteria from all of us that nobody is going to out-antidrug me.I can tell you that.So we all get up, posture, make our little funny statements here, and itis not going to make a hill of beans difference. That is the facts of thecase. That does not mean that I am advocating_well, I guess I would beadvocating that we do away with this amendment. DOD claims they reallyput out all the necessary effort, and it cost some $6.2 billion additionala year. Sixty-six new AWAC's are required to give a round-the-clock servicefor air interdiction. That is where we stand on this.So we are posturing. I think we do not have an estimate of the dollars.We have not had hearings on this. We do not have an integrated program.The administration, as I understand it, vetoed a drug czar bill severalyears ago while still talking about the need for an effective drug program.This is not the mission for the military. There are some things the militarycan do well, and should be doing to help out in this. But to think we aregoing to suddenly authorize the military to do all the surveillance, itjust is not going to happen that way.Let me give you a couple of other figures on this. Out of 591 hours flownlast year by AWACS, it resulted in six interdictions_six interdictionsout of 591 hours flown. So that is the kind of thing we are up against.We do not have a coordinated program yet. I know that this is going togo through on a steamroller basis. There are going to be all sorts of peoplethat will be overwhelmingly voting and I realize that. But it is not goingto make that much difference at all.What we need really is the administration getting solidly behind a drugprogram and proposing it, coordinating it, and getting the dozen or sodifferent agencies involved.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.[S13MY8-860]{S5761}GLENNMr. GLENN. I think everyone gets my message. I hope we can pull togethera solid drug program, and not do all of this rhetoric here for press releasepurposes.

Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senatorfrom Connecticut.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.[S13MY8-863]{S5761}WEICKERMr. WEICKER. Mr. President, first of all, I want to associate myself withevery remark made by the distinguished Senator from Ohio. We are all fora war on drugs. The last time we had a war on drugs was 1986. We had awar on drugs bill here that cost $600 million. If you will recall, in thelast moments of that debate, Senator <T4>Hatfield </T4>and myself stood up and said, ``Where are we to get themoney?'' It was then revealed that alcohol abuse and mental health programswere to pay for the war on drugs. Fortunately, the U.S. Senate rejectedthat. Additional moneys were found.In the Appropriations Committee as a result of the across-the-board cutimposed on Labor-HHS during the budget summit conference, substance abusegrants in States were cut below the 1987 level. Drug abuse programs werecut below the 1987 level while we are here posturing on new drug initiatives.Has anyone thought for 1 minute how bizarre it is that we hear recommendationsof sending the Coast Guard to the Persian Gulf while the military comeshome to fight the war on drugs?Now, I think it is important that we have a war on drugs. But I think italso important to understand that we should pay for a war on drugs. Thisis the same argument we had 2 years ago.What worries me is that my colleagues might feel that by using the militarythis would be a cheap way to fight. The already exist. So why not use them.Then we do not have to add dollars, we do not have to ask for additionalrevenue and we can have our war.The military has its hands full. I am glad to hear the distinguished Senatorfrom Ohio, who has far more experience in this area than I do, commentthat they have other missions to fulfill. Some believe, as I, these missionsshould be better fulfilled than is the present case. God knows they havedifficulties enough to protect the national security in a military sense.Has anybody stopped to remember how in the course of the war on drugs initiallypronounced here on the Senate floor in 1986 we then cut the Coast Guardbudget.I am for a war on drugs. I am for using the Coast Guard and the Drug EnforcementAgency, and other law enforcement agencies of this Nation to wage thatwar. And we ought to pay for it. That will call for drug abuse programs,it calls for what has to be a multibillion dollar investment in teachingour kids from 5 years of age that if you use drugs you are dead or nextto it. So as to dry up the market because there is not enough barbed wireor helicopters to stop drugs from coming in. You have to eliminate themarket. That's our kids.This is posing even for an election year. We think so little about thewar on drugs that we wage it in terms of an amendment to a bill which haseverthing to do with national security in a military sense.It is going to be very difficult for anyone to vote against this. However,I do not want to mislead the American people into feeling that this warcan be won at its present funding levels for law enforcement and education.It cannot.We are not spending enough money on traditional law enforcement or theeducation of our children. What is involved here also falls far short constitutionally.You are treading dangerous ground in the mixing of civilian and militarylaw enforcement insofar as the Constitution is concerned.The most important point to make is the priority this problem should commandin terms of money, law enforcement, education, and treatment.On the one hand, across the way, we are cutting back on our commitmentto drug abuse while we come on the floor and give the impression that weare upping the stakes.If we would only match the intensity of the rhetoric with the funding requiredto do the job, we would win the war on drugs. As long as people feel itcan be won on the cheap, believe me, nothing will happen, and the childrenof America stay at risk.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.[S13MY8-864]{S5761}WEICKERMr. WEICKER. I ask for 30 more seconds.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S13MY8-865]{S5761}WEICKERMr. WEICKER. Do you want to know the dimensions of what we are talkingabout here? I suspect that the education tab alone is $2 to $3 billionin education costs. Yet there are no such funds presenting themselves beforeus for judgment. Only, let the military to it, with the thought that wedo not have to ask for additional money.Nobody asked to pay for the Vietnam war, it raised economic hell, and nobodywon the war. This war is going to raise hell economically, and we'll notwin it. This is a horrible amendment mainly because it is deceptive.[S13MY8-866]{S5761}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment, but I doso and forewarn my colleagues that we are altering the course of history.For 110 years, since 1878, the men and women of the Armed Forces have nothad the mission of law enforcement, and for good reason. It was decidedthen, and indeed in the deliberations that the Senators worked on herefor the past 2 or 3 days, that the military really should not be involvedin law enforcement unless the Nation is faced with most unusual circumstances.I say to my good friend from Connecticut that I originally opposed anyprovision in these bills for arrest. However, after talking with the membersof the President's Cabinet_and the President, himself, who addressed thisdecision yesterday_and after conferring with my colleagues, I was persuadedto support this legislation, providing certain criteria were carefullymet. First, we provide individual protection for the men and women of the armedservices of the United States in the event they are taken into a courtof law, following an arrest or some incident involving this new authority.There, the United States will be the defender, if they are charged.Second, this legislation carefully provides that such arrest as the menand women in the Armed Forces may be involved in, take place beyond thecontinental limits of the United States. That would entail only activitiesbeyond the 3-mile limit of our territorial waters. In essence, we have preserved the doctrine of posse comitatus as it hasworked, and worked well, for 110 years in our own domestic situation. Last, and most important, I thank my colleagues for bearing with me asI fought hard for this principle. In my judgment, we have reduced to abare minimum the participation of the men and women of the Armed Forcesin actual arrests beyond the territorial limits. Several drafts were preparedas we considered this issue, but the present version of the amendment beforeus provides that service members may assist in or perform such arrestsor powers of arrests constent with the same authority now given the CoastGuard. It is my hope and expectation that as the Secretary of Defense draws upthe rules and regulations to govern the activities of the Armed Forces,the emphasis will be placed on keeping to a bare minimum the participationof members of the Armed Forces in such arrests.As we have found here, the Department of Defense is uniquely capable ofconducting detection and monitoring activities in support of drug interdictionactivities and it is our expectation that the President will select theDepartment of Defense as the lead agency for this function. The Departmentof Defense is uniquely qualified because of the highly trained status ofour men and women of the Armed Forces and their equipment, particularlyin the area of communications and maritime surveillance.Much is already being done today by the Department of Defense and the menand women of the Armed Forces, in support of drug enforcement activities,so, in a sense, we are adding to what is already being done.We do this knowing full well that we are altering the course of history,which has served this Nation for 110 years; but we do so in the face ofa specific finding that the drug problem in this country is one that istantamount to a danger to our national security interests.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the followingSenators be added as original cosponsors: Senator <T4>Stevens</T4>, Senator <T4>McConnell</T4>, Senator <T4>Domenici</T4>, and Senator <T4>Conrad</T4>.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, several times over the past 20 years, thisNation has declared war on drugs. It is a war we are losing.In my own State, an article that appeared in the St. Paul Pioneer Presslast week told of a gang war between Los Angeles-based on Chicago-basedgroups for control of the Twin Cities drug traffic. Twelve- and thirteen-year-oldsrun drug routes making $2,500 a day. The St. Paul chief of police saidhis force was losing the fight against the invasion of drug, and said heneeds more help from the Federal Government.He is right. The problem doesn't begin in the Twin Cities. It is a nationalproblem that begins on our Nation's borders, which have become sieves.As many as 20,000 aircraft a year intrude into our territory but refuseto land at border airports. That means every hour of every day, two planeloadsof drugs land in this country and go on to the market. In addition, thousandsof boats each year dock uninspected at ports of entry, smuggling in tonsof drugs.Despite all the money we spend, and our best efforts to patrol our borders,we are losing ground. The drug epidemic is now more than simply a criminalproblem. We are now dealing with an issue that cuts at the heart of ourway of life and our national security.That is why more than a year ago I went to see then Secretary of DefenseWeinberger to discuss ways in which the military could become more directlyinvolved. That is why a few weeks ago, I also went to see Secretary Carlucciand Navy Secretary Will Ball. That is why I put my colleagues on noticethat I would be offering an amendment during consideration of this bill.And that is why I have been delighted to join with my colleagues in fashioningthis amendment.Mr. President, it is time to commit the resources we have available tous in fighting the cancer of drugs. That means we must at least turn directlyto the armed forces. Only our military has untapped resources_both equipmentand personnel_that can be brought to bear to increase our efforts and toturn the tide.Yes, we must deal with reducing demand for illicit drugs in this country.That requires a steady effort of education. But certainly one way to reducedemand in the short term is to reduce supply. The ready availability ofdrugs in this country helps create the demand. They are easily obtainedalmost everywhere in this country, from small town to large city. And theyare available to kids not yet out of elementary school. But if we couldcut down on the supply, at least some of the demand would evaporate quickly.But to do that, we must engage the forces of the military now.Mr. President, our amendment increases the involvement of the militaryin drug interdiction, but it also gives the President important flexibility.For the first time, the President will be authorized to deploy equipmentand appropriately trained military personnel to detect, locate, pursue,search, and seize vessels and aircraft, and, yes, in appropriate cases,make arrests outside the borders of the United States.It's important to note the phrase ``appropriately trained military personnel.''Our amendment would provide needed training and would wisely limit thearrest authority of the armed forces. A training program will be developedfor those military personnel assigned to drug interdiction activities.Moreover, the amendment specifically states that searches, seizures andarrests will be conducted ``in the same manner and to the same extent''as the Coast Guard.The amendment will also increase, as soon as possible, the dedicated flighttime of radar surveillance aircraft . This is absolutely essential.We will never stop the penetration of our borders if we do not increaseour monitoring capability. The amendment will also increase the numberof aircraft to pursue the invaders once sighted.Finally, Mr. President, the administration is directed to examine the possibleeffectiveness of using members of the National Guard and Reserves for druginterdiction. It would be my hope that they, too, will soon be broughtinto the fight.Mr. President, our proposal is a reasonable response to an unreasonablesituation. It will send the message that we are serious in our dedicationto reduce the drug epidemic we face. It deals responsibly with complicatedissues: It does not permit the military to engage in law enforcement activitieswithin the borders of the United States. It leaves flexibility for theDefense Department to determine much of the military's involvement. Butit makes that involvement direct and meaningful. If ever there was an ideawhose time had come, Mr. President, this is it. If we are to stop losingthe war, the steps proposed in this amendment must be adopted.[S13MY8-890]{S5764}KASSEBAUMMr. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in supportingthis compromise legislation which expands the role of the military in thefight to combat illegal drugs.The role of the military in this effort is a very controversial and difficultissue which has demanded a significant amount of time by this body overthe past several years.We have been trying to balance our longstanding tradition of separatingthe military from civilian law enforcement against the growing outragearound the country over the increasing influx of illegal drugs across ourborders and into towns and schoolyards.I have long argued that the fight against drugs is a fight that must takeplace against both supply and demand side. If the demand is strong, thesupply will keep coming in. We cannot ignore either half of this war.Our efforts to stop the inflow of drugs over the past several years havebeen frustrated by a lack of resources and a lack of coordination. It isfor these reasons that I believe it is important for us to move towarda more deliberate involvement of the military in this effort particularlyin the areas of detection and coordination. I believe this amendment takesan important step in dealing with this very important problem.[S13MY8-891]{S5764}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of thefollowing Senators be added as cosponsors of this amendment: the Senatorfrom Oklahoma [Mr. <T4>Boren</T4>], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. <T4>Exon</T4>], and the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. <T4>Hollings</T4>].The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the manager, I yield 4 minutes tothe Senator from Tennessee [Mr. <T4>Sasser</T4>].[S13MY8-893]{S5764}SASSERMr. SASSER. I thank my friend from Illinois for yielding. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of this compromise amendment.Mr. President, the time has come to bring additional resources of the U.S.Government to bear in the war against drugs. The time has come to ask ourNation's military to help us fight that war. Mr. President, I believe we are losing the war against drugs in our society.And when you are losing the war, you have to commit more troops to thefield. That is what our amendment would do. This week, many of us have been meeting off the floor debating the properrole for the military in the drug war. I have opposed granting the militaryarrest authority. That is not what our military forces were created forand trained to do. For years, the law of the land has prohibited the militaryfrom becoming policemen. That law has existed for years, and for good reasons. Our military existsto protect this Nation and the free world from external aggression. Theposse comitatus provisions are in the law to assure that the Nation's militaryforces will be available when we need them and for the missions we needthem for. It is important that the antidrug job we assign to the military is theproper job, and is effective and contributes to the task at hand, withoutcompromising the primary mission of our nation's military. Mr. President, this amendment is a compromise on the arrest authority issue.It is limited to forces on board Navy and Coast Guard vessels. Let me say that I agree with the concerns raised over this provision bythe chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I hope the conferees willcarefully consider the implications of this provision. But, Mr. President, overall, this compromise amendment is a major stepin the war against drugs. That is why I am pleased to cosponsor it. I have been pleased to work with Senator <T4>Nunn </T4>and others in providing that a larger role can be playedby the National Guard in the war against drugs. It is that particular provisionof our amendment I would like to discuss here today. The amendment we are offering provides up to $60 million through the Statenational guard forces for an expanded drug enforcement and interdictionrole. Many of our colleagues may not be aware, but the National Guard hasbeen making a substantial contribution to the war on drugs since 1983.Thirty-four States have been participating. A large amount of guard equipmenthas been loaned to civil enforcement authorities. The legislation we are offering builds upon that past record and significantlyexpands upon it. The provision relating to the National Guard, by itself is a substantialand positive contribution to expanding the Department of Defense's rolein the antidrug effort. Our amendment does not mandate the Governors to adopt a specific courseof action. But, let me explain what just $20 million of the $60 millionwe are earmarking for the army and Air National Guard drug efforts couldbuy. For only $20 million we could provide continuous oncall availability ofan Army National Guard Drug Surveillance Team and an Air Guard ground-basedradar control unit to assist civil drug enforcement entities.Within that $20 million we could also provide a surge capacity of up tofive helicopter teams and two radar control units for a sustained periodof intense activity of up to 2 months.Let me say that if the Governors choose to assist in the drug war by creatinga National Guard drug surveillance team and radar control unit, guardsmanparticipation would be voluntary. Members could be drawn from the 12 existingArmy Guard attack helicopter battalions, the 28 aviation lift companiesand Air Guard tactical control units in 18 States.Army Guard drug surveillance teams, as I have described, could providemore than 10,000 flying hours in support of civil drug interdiction efforts.Each team could consist of 2 observation helicopters, 2 attack Cobra helicopters,and 4 lift helicopters such as Huey's, and each team could be manned by24 personnel.Air National Guard units could consist of 1 AN/TPS-43E radar and associatedequipment and could be manned by 28 personnel.Mr. President, this is what this amendment could accomplish. The calculationsI have cited are based on rotating, continuous deployments of 7 days fordrug surveillance teams, and continuous 12-day deployments for radar controlunits. Estimates include projected fiscal year 1989 costs for transportation,per diem, fuel, pay allowances, and other associated costs.Mr. President, a National Guard drug interdiction program, adopted by outNation's Governors, could make a major contribution in the war on drugs.But let me make this distinction. The amendment does not authorize theinvolvement of National Guard personnel in the actual apprehension, arrestor confrontation of suspects. Guard personnel would always be in supportof, and not in place of, civil law enforcement personnel. The duties, missions,roles, and the concept of operations would be in accordance with a plansubmitted by individual State Governors and approved by the appropriatedrug enforcement agencies and the Secretary of Defense.Assistance to civil drug enforcement authorities would be pursuant to NationalGuard training activities authorized by title 32 of the United States Code.Activities by State Guard units would be scheduled in a manner that wouldnot detract from Guard routine training missions and the Guard's supportof the national defense and the total military force.However, activities by State Guard units in an expanded drug interdictionprogram would be designed to maximize the training value of the activity.So, Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment which wouldmake a major contribution in the war against drugs.The provisions in the amendment are a significant step in the directionof solving the drug epidemic that inflicts our great land.Mr. President, in my native State of Tennessee I have had instances describedto me and read the investigative reports in which drug airplanes were onthe verge of landing at a small mountain airport in the dark of night.Local law enforcement had heard it would happen, but they simply couldnot get there fast enough with enough manpower to get the job done.Now, if National Guard helicopters had been available on continuous callthey could have been pressed into service to carry the necessary law enforcementpersonnel to the location to make the arrest and to apprehend the drugdealers.I think this gives you one example of how this bill can be helpful.Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee forhis leadership in this area and I urge approval of the amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?[S13MY8-894]{S5765}WARNERMr. WARNER. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.[S13MY8-895]{S5765}CHAFEEMr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I start with the reluctance to involve the militaryin essentially new and basically civilian duties.I look around and see some in this Chamber who perhaps recall in the mid-1930'swhen what was known as the U.S. Army Air Corps was assigned the duty tocarry the U.S. mails, and those who remember that also remember it wasa disaster. Not only did we lose a lot of pilots and a lot of aircraft,but finally the conclusion was the the U.S. Army Air Corps were not thepeople to carry the U.S. mails and it should return to the original set-up,which was have civilians carry the mail in the air. However, I think we are facing a unique situation here which has previouslybeen outlined on the floor.The urgency of doing something about the inflow of drugs into our countryhas to be addressed.Perhaps this will not succeed, but it appears to me that this amendmentis carefully constricted, that it has limitations upon it, that it callsupon the military to make significant restricted contributions in airborneradar coverage, in communications in the loan of pursuit aircraft, andin the use of the National Guard.Because it has thus been carefully constricted because the problem is sooverwhelming, so demanding of attention, so dangerous to the future ofour Nation, I support this amendment.Will it solve all the problems? Of course, it will not. But I think fromour experience with it we can decide whether to go further, whether toextend the use of the armed services in the future or rather to returnto the essential basic structure we have now using the Drug EnforcementAdministration, the Coast Guard, and the Customs Service.So we will learn a lot from this and I think it is worthwhile proceeding,and I thank the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That study, in essence, shows thatif we could raise our level of interdiction to 50 percent, which is probablysuperior to what we could do if we put every soldier in the whole Army,every sailor, every member of the Air Force, and every marine along ourborder, we would not raise the price of drugs on American streets by morethan 10 percent.The only way we are going to truly win the war on drugs to attack the useof drugs in America. We are going to have to pay for education and we aregoing to have to end the absurd situation where the fellow selling thedrugs is a criminal and the guy who is buying the drugs is the victim.The person who is buying the drugs is also a criminal. We are going to have to build jails and we are going to have to put peoplein jail. We are going to have to have a sentence like 10 years in prisonfor selling drugs to a minor. We need the death penalty for people whokill police officers or commit murder in the course of drug trafficking.We are going to have to impose penalties on people who use drugs. We aregoing to have to take people driver's licenses away. We are going to haveto fine them. We are going to have to deny them access to public services.We are going to have to get tough with people who are buying drugs. We confiscate a plane when that plane is smuggling drugs. When somebodyis carrying dope on that plane, we ought to take their plane. We shoulddo the same when they use drugs in their car or their house. In short, we are going to have to get serious about the problem, and thereis no way we can do that without treating those who buy and use drugs ascriminals. This amendment does not do that, but it is an important first step. Believeme, this war will be fought, and we will win this war. We can eliminate drug use in America by the end of the century, if we arewilling to put a program in place that will eliminate the demand for drugs.This is an important first step and I am committed to it. I strongly supportthis provision. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Rockefeller</T4>). The Republican leader.[S13MY8-902]{S5766}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, first of all I ask unanimous consent to add thedistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. <T4>Grassley, </T4>as a cosponsor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [S13MY8-903]{S5766}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, all of us in this country have been waging a rhetoricalwar on drugs for a long, long time. But talk is cheap. It's about timethat we started waging a real war, on this very real and deadly enemy.It is about time we started using all the national resources at our command,to deal with this national_and international_crisis. Enacting this amendment into law will let us use our greatest war fightingresource_our Armed Forces_against the heavily armed and aggressive internationaldrug cartel. Enacting this amendment will let designated armed forces personnel takedecisive action_arrest action_against drug smugglers who now ply theirdirty trade with immunity. Enacting this amendment into law will let us employ modern technology,including a sophisticated antidrug radar system, in this critical battleagainst a well organized, lavishly financed enemy, who is outfitted withthe latest and best in transportation, communications, and support. Enacting this amendment, in short, will let us use our best against theworst threat facing America and Americans today: The scourge of drugs.I do not think anybody is certain how much impact this amendment will haveafter it gets through conference. But it will have some, and it will beanother step in the direction of doing what we think should be done inthis case with the administration approval signed off on by the President,that we are serious about drugs. It seems to me that in itself is important.There have been a lot of statements made. There is some opposition to theamendment. There have been some good points made against the amendment,put it that way, from the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Ohio,and others. There are a lot of reservations about engaging the military in any capacity.But I believe that the principal sponsors who have worked on this amendmentfor the past several days have had the cooperation of the Attorney General'soffice and the cooperation of the Department of Defense. We notified SecretaryCarlucci yesterday that we were going to do something in the Congress andthe Senate and that he ought to come up and help us. He was very good aboutit. He was here and he was cooperative. He met with the President. ThePresident signed off on this limited involvement by the military.We hope it is going to be constructive. We hope it is a step in the rightdirection. I am very pleased to support the amendment. I hope my colleagueswill endorse with their votes. I yield back any time I may have. [S13MY8-904]{S5766}DIXONMr. DIXON. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I have longbeen a proponent of increasing the role of the military in the war on drugs.In 1986, I offered an amendment to give the armed services the power tomake arrests, searches and seizures.This amendment allows, for the first time, members of the Armed Forcesto assist in or perform arrests, searches and seizures outside the UnitedStates. While this is a significant departure from previous policy, itis also a logical extension of the Ledet Program established in the 1986antidrug bill. This program places Coast Guard personnel on naval vesselsto perform law enforcement functions, including arresting drug traffickers.This amendment advances this concept by allowing these Coast Guard personnelto cross-designate members of the Navy to assist in, or perform arrests,searchs and seizures. I believe that the provisions of this amendment whichallow military personnel the ability to perform law enforcement functionswill have a significant effect on the war on drugs. Drug traffickers willnow know that the U.S. Navy will not simply watch them go by. Rather, everynavy vessel has the potential to interdict and arrest them.As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I also believe this bill takesan important and necessary step in giving the Armed Forces the missionof detection and monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime nationalsecurity threats. This mission not only helps prevent the penetration ofthe U.S. by drug traffickers, but also by other growing threats such asterrorism.If we are going to win, I believe that we must apply all the resourcesavailable, including the military, in the war on drugs. This bill takesimportant steps in that direction.I want to express my appreciation to my colleagues who worked so hard tomake this amendment possible. Senators <T4>Wilson, Nunn, Warner, Graham, D'Amato, Thurmond, Dole, </T4>and <T4>Sasser</T4> should all be congratulated for bringing their separateideas together into this coherent and urgently needed legislation.The message of this amendment is clear; drugs are a threat to the nationalsecurity of this country. The Armed Forces of the United States will beexplicitly looking for drug traffickers, and when they find them, theywill be arrested and brought to justice.Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficientsecond.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S13MY8-905]{S5766}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator <T4>Murkowski</T4> be added as an original cosponsor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S13MY8-906]{S5767}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the majority leader that there be a stipulatedtime in which other Senators might wish to add themselves as original cosponsors.[S13MY8-907]{S5767}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that other Senatorsmay add their names as cosponsors during the rest of the day prior to thepassage of the bill.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S13MY8-908]{S5767}BYRDMr. BYRD. Is all time expired?The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not expired. It has been yielded backhowever.[S13MY8-909]{S5767}TRIBLEMr. TRIBLE. Mr. President, I commend Senator <T4>Wilson </T4>for offering this amendment, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.This initiative is long overdue.Year after year, the flow of narcotics across our southern border has continued.We have increased our interdiction efforts, and we have spent more moneyto help catch drug smugglers. But the efforts of Government have been morethan matched by those who transport these deadly drugs. As a result, thedrug flow has become a flood. A tidal wave of narcotics overwhelms ourshores.Clearly, more must be done. This amendment will accomplish that by enhancingthe military's role in a careful but effective way. It will enhance radarsurveillance at our shores, and improve our ability to interdict the drugflow.In so doing, it will benefit our children who suffer most from these drugs.It will benefit our law enforcement officers, who too often fall prey toarmed drug runners.Perhaps most important, it recognizes the drug trade for what it is_a threatto national security, and it calls upon our national security forces toplay a greater role in defending us. It is another important step in gettinga handle on the narcotics trade, and I urge its adoption.[S13MY8-910]{S5767}LAUTENBERGMr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express strong support forthe drug interdiction amendment to the Department of Defense authorizationbill. I am pleased to cosponsor this step forward in the war against illegaldrugs. Drugs are a scourge in our society. They are ruining the lives of too manyof our young people. Drugs distort people's values, sap their energies,and steal their futures. The ready availability of drugs on the streetsof our cities is a shocking disgrace. The blatant selling and use of illegaldrugs in the open is a slap in the face to law-abiding citizens and anopen expression of contempt for the majority of our society. And drugsincrease the wave of urban crime that plagues residents of all our States.To fight this scourge, we need to make the costs of drug dealing unacceptableto those who exploit our young in a cyncial attempt to profit. Drugs cannotbe tolerated. Supply must be curtailed. Illegal drugs are big business. An enormous amountof money is to be made in this business. And the offsetting costs for thesuppliers are relatively small. The chances of a supplier being interceptedare not great. This amendment will marshal the resources of Government agencies, includingthe Department of Defense, to use them in a coordinated fashion. The Presidentwill be required to designate a lead agency for the detection and monitoringof drug smuggling by air and sea. The President must also provide Congresswith plans for integration and control of communications and intelligenceresources being used for drug interdiction. In addition to this essential coordination, the amendment calls for DODto share its equipment with other agencies. Radar surveillance aircraftwill be used to increase the time devoted to drug interdiction, assistanceto civilian agencies, and coverage of the Southwest border. The Departmentof Defense shall lend helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes to the CoastGuard and Customs Service to be used to pursue airplanes and ships involvedin illegal drug operations. I am pleased that this amendment will also allow Coast Guard personnelto be deployed more economically as they carry out their drug interdictionfunctions. Navy personnel on board ship will be deputized to carry outCoast Guard law enforcement functions once they have been properly trainedby the Coast Guard, so long as a member of the Coast Guard is also on board.The National Guard will also be permitted to take a larger role in druginterdiction and enforcement. State Governors who wish to make use of thisauthority will have to submit plans to the Secretary of Defense and assurethat the time spent on antidrug activities will not detract from annualtraining and other national defense requirements of the National Guard.The battle against the tragedy of drugs must be fought on many fronts_noone program, no one proposal will win this war. Every reasonable weaponmust be brought into this fight. The Department of Defense has equipmentand personnel that are at the ready to defend this country against itsenemies. Drugs are as serious a threat to this country as any enemy soldier.It is appropriate to use our defense forces to help protect us againstthe scourge of drugs. I urge the adoption of the amendment.   [S13MY8-911]{S5767}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for regular order. [S13MY8-912]{S5767}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might be granted just 10 seconds to acknowledgethe unusual participation by staff in formulating this particular legislation.Many staff remained up a good part of the night and tirelessly worked todayto make it possible for the Senate to reach this tough compromise.[S13MY8-913]{S5767}amendment <ITAG tagnum="89">amendment no. 2068 </ITAG>The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Byrd amendment to the Grammamendment. [S13MY8-914]{S5767}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Mr. President, as I understand the parliamentary situation,now that regular order has been called for, the pending business of theSenate is the Gramm amendment, with an amendment pending to that that Ihave offered. I do not wish to preclude debate on either my own or theamendment of the Senator from Texas, but I know people want to vote onthe drug amendment. In order to expedite matters, I would be prepared, if the Senator fromTexas wants, to enter into a brief time agreement on both sides to limitour time and then I would propose to move to table the Gramm amendment,which would carry both his amendment and my pending amendment to it. ButI do not want to make that motion to table at this very second becauseI do not want to preclude the Senator from Texas, who has not had a chanceto explain his amendment. [S13MY8-915]{S5767}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Will the distinguished Senator yield? [S13MY8-916]{S5767}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I am happy to yield. [S13MY8-917]{S5767}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it seems to me that we ought to go ahead andhave a unanimous consent request that allows us to vote on the drug amendment.Then we can come back and discuss this matter. So I ask unanimous consent that the pending Gramm amendment and the Byrdamendment to that amendment be set aside so we might vote on the drug amendment.[S13MY8-918]{S5767}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard. [S13MY8-919]{S5767}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania did not yield forthat purpose. He offered to get unanimous consent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania does, in fact, havethe floor. [S13MY8-920]{S5767}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Mr. President, I want to request again, as a matter of expeditingthe business of the Senate, that we have a brief time to debate the Grammamendment. Otherwise, I guess I will have no alternative, if we want tomove ahead in the Senate, than to make a tabling motion. I do not wantto do that. But we set aside the Gramm amendment to try to accommodatethe Senators interested in the drug amendment. We did not want to dragthis out all night. So I hope we can have whatever brief discussion is necessary on our amendment.It is virtually going to be the same discussions we had yesterday. TheSenator is going to make his speech and read the Wall Street Journal articleinto the <T4>Record </T4>again for the third or fourth time. And he makes a terrificspeech, but I do not know that we all have to hear it again. [S13MY8-921]{S5768}BYRDMr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield to me without losing his right to thefloor? [S13MY8-922]{S5768}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I am happy to yield. [S13MY8-923]{S5768}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the now pending amendment was temporarily setaside so that the Senate could proceed to the drug amendment. Now Senatorsare leaving and more are going to leave soon. By virtue of allowing thedrug amendment to come up prior to the coal amendment, if we proceed towith the drug amendment, we are going to lose Senators. They are goingto vote on that amendment, but some have to go. So I suggest that, now that the Gramm-Heinz amendment is back before theSenate where it was prior to being temporarily set aside, that there be5 minutes debate, to be equally divided between Mr. <T4>Gramm </T4>and Mr. <T4>Heinz </T4>and that the Senate then vote on the tabling motion whichMr. <T4>Heinz </T4>will make. He will move to table the underlying amendmentwhich will carry with it his own amendment. Then gets rid of that issueif the matterthat  <ITAG tagnum="80">is tabled. Then we would vote immediately on the drug amendment andSenators can have two votes back to back.</ITAG>Otherwise, if the Senator cannot get unanimous consent, as I understoodhim, he will move to table and there will not be any time for the debate.[S13MY8-924]{S5768}GRAMMMr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.Mr. President, very briefly, what we are doing is we are having the samedebate that we had yesterday, with a difference. The Senator from Texashas offered about one-half of the Gramm amendment to strike domestic preference.The only thing, I would point out to my colleagues, is that while it maybe partially different, it is the same game, and the game is this: Thegame is that today the Senator from Texas is going to strike just the domesticpreference for energy for DOD purchases_for coal, for bituminous coal,for anthracite coal. I have no doubt the next time out he will try andstrike it for steel and specialty metals, like he did yesterday. The timeafter that he will do it for textiles or for shoes. And the time afterthat he will do it for agricultural products.What he will do_and he is a very shrewd and able legislator, and I wouldexpect him to do no less_is to hang each of these particular__[S13MY8-931]{S5768}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, could we have order? The Senator deserves tobe heard.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does deserve to be heard, although histime has expired.[S13MY8-932]{S5768}HEINZMr. HEINZ. I yield myself 30 additional seconds.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may proceed. [S13MY8-933]{S5768}HENIZMr. HENIZ. He will undoubtedly try and slice off part of the domestic preference,some 43 years in the law, a piece at a time. And, as the old saying goes,we will each hang separately unless we hang together. Those domestic preferencewere put in for a very good reason. We debated that all yesterday. I willnot repeat myself, except to say that it is the same game all over again,even if it is slice by slice.[S13MY8-934]{S5768}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 of my 5 minutes.I would like to begin my making the point that this ruse in the readingof the amendment and jamming it up against the drug amendment has one goaland that is that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania desperatelydoes not want to debate this issue because he does not want the Americanpeople to understand it.Yesterday, he struck a provision of the armed services bill that did twothings. One, it eliminated American preference. That is no longer an issue.He won on that. The other thing it did is it struck a provision in ourbill that ended the buying of coal that the Defense Department does notwant and does not need.I want to read two paragraphs from an article from the April 5, Wall StreetJournal. It tells the whole story.[S13MY8-935]{S5768}<ITAG tagnum="21">This year, for the first time since 1962, the Pentagon won't shipAmerican anthracite coal to West Germany, where U.S. bases already ownenough to last for more than 4 years. Instead, the Pentagon will buy 300,000tons of anthracite that it doesn't need and will spread it 20 feet highover 45 acres of land in Eastern Pennsylvania, a monument to Congress andthe coal lobby.</ITAG>I could also read, if I had time, statements from the Secretary of Defense.What we are being asked to do is to continue outright theft of the moneyof the working men and women of America. The Pentagon does not want thiscoal. We have  stacked it all along railroad tracks in Germany. Now weare going to stack it 20 feet deep over 45 acres of land in Pennsylvania.Mr. President, this theft of the fruits of the labor of the working menand women of America has got to stop. Do not force the Pentagon to spendmoney on a product that is not needed.If you were outraged by the overpricing of the hammers and the cathoderay tubes and the toilet seats, do not let the American people be robbedby a ripoff that exceeds the cumulative totals that we have spent on allthose items, legitimately and illegitimately, in the whole life of theRepublic.That is an effort to steal from the working men and women of America byasking us to buy coal we do not need to spread it 20 feet deep over 45acres.In fact, we could leave the coal in the ground, pay every coal miner $138,000a year in perpetuity, and still save the taxpayers money. Please recognizetheft when you see it and do not humilitate the U.S. Senate in the eyesof the American people by failing to adopt this amendment.I urge my colleagues, do not let special interests rob the people again.Vote no on this motion to table and let us stop buying coal we do not needto cover up God's beautiful Earth.I reserve the remainder of my time.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.[S13MY8-936]{S5768}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Mr. President, I want to point out two things to our colleagues.the first is the parliamentary situation, which is if this motion to tabledoes not succeed we are going to be back on my amendment, which is in thenature of a substitute for the Gramm amendment. I will spend the necessarytime explaining what that is.That amendment, however, is very pertinent to what the Senator from Texasis trying to strike from the bill. Because what my amendment would do wouldbe to put a temporary hold, just a little bit more than a year, not even,on the conversion of our bases in NATO from their existing sources of energy,some of which indeed are U.S. domestic source coal energy, to what is calleddistrict heat. And there is a very good policy reason for that.Because, if we do not put a careful spotlight on why the Pentagon is doingthat, it may cost the American taxpayers not some $20 million a year, but$1 billion a year in converting all these facilities.If we do go ahead and convert all those facilities, it is going to havea couple of interesting impacts. One is it is going to make our bases inEurope directly dependent in a very major degree on Soviet, Libyan, andMiddle Eastern oil and gas because that is where a substantial portionof the basic energy for those district heating plants comes from.This Senator did not want to have the military in Western Europe pay $1billion to have to go out and buy Soviet natural gas and Libyan oil. Thatis the issue here, no matter what my friend from Texas may try and tellthe Senate to the contrary.I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.[S13MY8-937]{S5769}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania hastried to cloud the issue. The issue is, are we going to buy coal we donot need and stack it 20 feet deep over 45 acres in Pennsylvania?It is true that the Heinz amendment to my amendment not only continuesto buy coal to stack it in Pennsylvania but he also wants to buy coal tostack in Germany.Mr. President, I know everybody wants to go home. I know everybody is tiredof this issue. But I want you to understand I am going to offer this amendmentover and over and over, and I am going to write on it and I am going tospeak on it until this wrong is righted. I want my colleagues to know thatwhen they vote to buy this coal and stack it 20 feet deep over 45 acresas a tribute to special interests, that I am going to speak on it untilthe American people understand how their money is being squandered. This is wrong. It needs to be stopped. This is a greater outrage than somelittle petty crook selling a hammer at 10 times its value. This is felonytheft of the taxpayer's money, perpetrated by special interest groups,who have spokesmen right here on this floor and it must be stopped.I urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion to table and I would suspectthat if we do that the debate will be over.[S13MY8-938]{S5769}HEINZMr. HEINZ. The Senator is about to have his words taken down and stricken.The Senator is about to have his words taken down and stricken.[S13MY8-939]{S5769}BYRDMr. BYRD. Worse than that. He may be forced to take a seat.[S13MY8-940]{S5769}HEINZMr. HEINZ. If I insist on my rights, the Senator from Texas will not beallowed to speak on the Senate floor.I urge him to retract what he said.[S13MY8-941]{S5769}GRAMMMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if I claimed that special interests are representedhere, we all know that is not correct and I withdraw it.Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas' time has expired.[S13MY8-942]{S5769}HEINZMr. HEINZ. Mr. President, we have already debated this issue. On Thursdaythe Senate voted by a 2-1 majority against the proposal now reoffered bythe Senator from Texas. I am certainly sorry that we have to revisit thisissue.My colleague has made a nice speech about anthracite, but the proposedamendment repeals the entire DOD solid fuel program, which covers bituminousand other coals. There is, of course, no mountain of anthracite. DOD hasnot begun making purchases in this fiscal year, and there is no coal onthe ground in Pennsylvania, or anywhere in the United States.The Senator has talked about taxpayer dollars. We are spending $1 billionto convert our European installations from U.S. coal to local fuel. Wheredoes that fuel come from Mr. President? According to a letter I have fromGeneral Otis, our Supreme Commander in Europe, 33 percent of West Germanoil comes from Libya and Algeria, and 25 percent or more of West Germangas comes from the Soviet natural gas pipeline. So, the plan is to stopbuying U.S. coal which costs $20 million, and instead spend $1 billionto convert U.S. facilities in Europe to Soviet and Libyan fuel. It is adirect transfer payment from the U.S. taxpayers to the Soviets and theirallies.My colleagues should be aware that the House has acted to bar the use offuel from the Soviet pipeline at United States military bases. Thus, DODcoal purchases will be needed if we are going to have a stable and securesource of fuel for our military operations. Let me emphasize, the alternativeis Soviet natural gas, or Libyan oil. I will have more to say on this ina moment.What my amendment does is to place a temporary moratorium on these costlyconversions that will make us more dependent on Soviet gas and Libyan oil,giving us the time to study the latest developments and the full implicationsof these conversions which the Gramm amendment would authorize to proceed.In a letter from the House National Security Caucus, Congressman <T4>Trent Lott </T4>had this to say about the amendment I have offered:[S13MY8-943]{S5769}<ITAG tagnum="21">The amendment places a moratorium on DOD's conversions of on-baseheating plants at U.S. facilities in West Germany to off-base municipalheating systems which rely on natural gas from the Soviet Union. The amendmentalso requires the Secretaries of Defense, State, and Commerce to reportto the Congess on the national security and economic policy consequencesof these conversions.</ITAG>Many of the German heating systems use natural gas, much of which comesfrom the Soviet Union. Today the Soviets supply 25 to 30 percent of thenatural gas used in Germany. Most of the rest comes from the North Sea;however, North Seas gas reserves<ITAG tagnum="80">will be depleted over the next 8 to 15 years. As these reserves aredepleted, there will be a dramatic increase in gas purchases from the Soviets.</ITAG>Somehow the Pentagon has forgotten that our troops are in Europe to protectagainst Soviet aggression. Becoming a major purchase of Soviet naturalgas and providing significant amounts of hard, Western currencies to theSoviets raises enormous policy questions with major foreign policy anddefense implications. These issues must be thoroughly debated both withinthe administration and within the Congress before any further conversionsare allowed to go forward.Until a complete review is finished, the United States military shouldnot be one of the Soviet Union's biggest gas customers, and the UnitedStates military should not be providing huge amounts of hard, Western currenciesto the Soviet Union.That, Mr. President, is Congressman <T4>Trent Lott, </T4>a respected figure on defense. Let me again statethat it will cost $1 billion to convert our bases to Soviet and Libyanfuels. On the other hand, it costs $20 million to purchase anthracite andbituminous coals to fuel those bases.This amendment requires the Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, and Stateto report, by early next year, on the economic benefits to the Soviet Unionof these conversions, and any justification for granting them these benefits.They would also be required to report on the extent to which American militarybases would rely upon Libyan, and Soviet fuels, and the consequences ofan interruption in supply from those nations.Conversions from coal to gas or oil heat would be restricted for 1 year,until the report is issued.Now, some may argue that we should go ahead and buy Soviet fuel anyway,because its cheaper than United States coal. With the dramatic shift inexchange rates, however, that argument holds no water. GAO found that conversionsfrom American coal to Soviet and North Sea fuel made economic sense onlywhen the German mark is worth more than 2.8 marks to the dollar. GAO foundthat when the exchange rate dropped below 2.8 marks to the dollar, coal-firedcentral heating would have been the least costly alternative. Today theexchange rate is 1.7 marks to the dollar, Mr. President, a rate more than40 percent beneath the point at which coal makes economic sense.So we are going to spend a billion to buy Soviet fuels that cost more thanUnited States fuels. Why are we sticking it to the taxpayers like this,Mr. President? We are going to do it because the Germans want it, and becausethe natural gas lobby doesn't want U.S. coal to have these markets.So if the Senator from Texas wants to talk about special interests, Mr.President, he has brought one to the floor. His amendment does not benefitthe gas lobby_they do not sell U.S. gas in Europe_but it is a gratuitousswipe at our coal producing ability that benefits only the Soviets andthe Libyans, and those Europeans who buy their products.In 1984 the Department of Defense enthusiastically agreed to increase itsusage of coal by 1.6 million tons, of which 1.3 million tons are to bebituminous coal, not anthracite. The plan called for U.S. bases to increasetheir usage of our most reliable energy source, namely coal. Since anthracitecoal is a clean-burning coal, it plays an important part in the plan, butbituminous coal is the chief product to be used, not anthracite. Thereare obviously those in this body who would prefer to have no coal usedby DOD and that is why allegations are raised that there are thousandsof tons of anthracite on the ground, and that there is some mountain ofcoal in Pennsylvania that DOD has built. There is no mountain, there areno tons of anthracite. According to this letter from General Otis, SupremeU.S. Commander in Europe, there are 100,000 tons of anthracite available,or little more than 1 year's supply at present usage.So my amendment takes care of the Senator from Texas' concern that thiscoal might not be used. It will be used, in lieu of Soviet gas, while DOD,Commerce, and State study the implications of dependency on the Soviets.I urge the adoption of the amendment.[S13MY8-944]{S5770}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, section 8113 of the fiscal year 1988 defense appropriationsbill merely readopted language identical to section 9099 of the fiscalyear 1987 defense appropriations bill. This provision earmarks existingfunds to be made available to initiate the Department of Defense conversionof 37 U.S. oil-fired boilers to coal, where cost-effective, in order toachieve a targeted consumption level of 1.6 million tons per year abovecurrent consumption levels at Defense facilities in the United States byfiscal year 1994. Under this important program, which was proposed by theDefense Department in a letter dated August 30, 1985, the Department hasselected eight sites which have already begun consuming more coal. Thisis a Defense Department sponsored initiative which needs to be continued.This provision would authorize the continued use of funds provided in fiscalyear 1986 to convert Defense facilities in the United States to coal. Again,this provision is merely a restatement of the provision included in thefiscal year 1987 defense appropriation chapter of the continuing resolution.Mr. President, for these reasons, I urge that the motion to table the amendmentby the Senator from Texas be adopted.

Mr. President, I take the floor at this time in the effort toinquire as to what the prospects are for winding up action on this billtoday, how many amendments remain, whether or not we can get an agreedtime to vote on final passage either today or Monday.I inquire of the distinguished manager.[S13MY8-964]{S5770}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, we have eightamendments that we have worked out now that can be handled without a rollcall.We can handle those after the Members leave tonight if we can work theothers out.We have a drug amendment which has now been agreed on after 2 days of veryintensive negotiation and that will be voted on next. We have an amendmentby Senator <T4>Johnston </T4>that Senator <T4>Cohen</T4> is involved in and they will agree to a 40-minute time limitationtoday, tonight, or Monday.On the rest of the amendments, I do not have any way of knowing whetherpeople are going to demand they be called up. My impression is the restof the amendments are about ready to drop. But if we do not get a unanimous-consentagreement, we have 30_how many amendments do we have, 40? We have over40 amendments. So if we leave this evening in that situation with mostof these amendments, people probably not intending to call them up, thenwe will be here another week, 10 days. So we have got to either get a unanimous-consentagreement, as I see it, and finish this tonight, or go on through and tryto finish tonight just by determination and taking amendments, or get atime certain to vote on final passage Monday.I am willing to do any of those three. I know Members are being inconvenienced,and I know they want to go home, but the Senate of the United States isgoing to face an impossible schedule if we do not move these bills. Thisbill is one of the big ones, as we all know. So we are talking about somethingthat can be concluded tonight or if we do not conclude it tonight and donot get a unanimous-consent agreement we could spend another week, 10 dayson it. So that is the dilemma. I would take any one of those three, either staytonight without a unanimous consent_I am willing to stay as long as thereare amendments offered. I know the Senator from Virginia is also. We seeeye to eye_or get unanimous consent on a time to finish tonight, whichI think is eminently possible, or get a time certain, any time Monday thatthe body will agree to, to finish the bill.Mr. Leader, that is the way I see it.[S13MY8-965]{S5771}BYRDMr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I believe it would be safe to say, if the twomanagers agree, that if we get a unanimous-consent agreement now that locksin a final date and time for a vote__The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader will suspend. The Senate willbe in order so that everyone may hear his statement.[S13MY8-1006]{S5772}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.[S13MY8-1007]{S5772}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, we have eight or nine amendments that can be agreedto tonight, and we will stay and handle those.We have two or three complications, and I ask the majority leader to propounda unanimous-consent request with these complications in mind.One is that there is a Johnston amendment that Mr. <T4>Cohen, </T4>Mr. <T4>Cochran, </T4>and Mr. <T4>Stennis </T4>are involved in and feel very strongly about. It is animportant amendment. I believe all sides would agree to a 90-minute timelimitation, equally divided between the proponents and opponents of thatamendment.This is on Monday, if we come in on Monday and do this.The next problem is that it will take 20 minutes, equally divided, on theDomenici-Bingaman amendment.There are four Helms amendments. One concerns Panama, I am told; one Afghanistan;one Ethiopia; and the other is an ABM report.Senator <T4>Helms </T4>has been very cooperative. He is willing to have an agreementthat he bring his amendment up on Monday and we would certainly work withhim to do that. He does not believe any of them are going to last longerthan an hour, equally divided. He has given us copies of the amendments.So I think we will be able to work this out if we have a final passage,and we assure the Senator we will work with him to get his amendments up.[S13MY8-1008]{S5772}HELMSMr. HELMS. Fair enough.[S13MY8-1009]{S5772}NUNNMr. NUNN. Without necessarily having a time limit on them, if Members arereluctant on that, but we will work with him.  In addition, we have a big complication and that is the capital punishmentamendment. I am one of those who favors capital punishment in certain circumstances.I think Senator <T4>D'Amato </T4>has a number of people on that and I think the Senatorfrom West Virginia also has a separate capital punishment amendment.  On this side there will be objections interposed to any time agreementfor final passage as long as the capital punishment amendment may comeup. That is not my position, but that is the position of those on thisside, in good faith.  So there is one possible way, and I think the majority leader would beable to propound this, to get a final passage considering all other amendmentsother than capital punishment and make that the exception, and then seeif we can handle that sometime on Monday one way or the other.  So if that amendment is brought up, that amendment is not subject to anytime limitation, but we would really complete all other amendments andsubject to that capital punishment amendment try to vote on final passagearound  4 o'clock on Monday or 5 o'clock on Monday, whatever we can get.That is the way I would suggest.  [S13MY8-1010]{S5772}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?  [S13MY8-1011]{S5772}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am glad to yield. I believe the majority leader has the floor.

We have now a compromise between the Armed Services Committeeand the Appropriations Committee on certain items that are in this billthat pertain to the continuing resolution and particularly the DefenseAppropriations Subcommittee portion of that that was enacted last fall. The ranking member, Senator <T4>Hatfield, </T4>is not in town. I understand that this meets his approval,but I would not like to proceed with this until he returns on Monday. I would like to have some assurance we could have time on Monday to implementthis agreement. It involves amendments to the bill. Then there are twofurther amendments that I understand that the distinguished manager ofthe bill is prepared to accept if I offer them that pertain to two othersections of the bill. One is section 907 and the other fixed price developmentcontracts. [S13MY8-1014]{S5772}NUNNMr. NUNN. The Senator is essentially correct. He added something at theend of his statement I am not sure of. I would not say I agree with everythingthe Senator said. I agree with about 95 percent of it; that is, we do havewhat we think is an agreement between the two committees relating to jurisdictionalmatters. There are a couple provisions, sections 903 and 904, that haveto be amended to reflect this agreement and we would be delighted to doit on Monday if this bill goes over to Monday, and we will work with theSenator on that. [S13MY8-1015]{S5772}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. The other two amendments I am concerned with are section 802and section 807.[S13MY8-1016]{S5772}DIXONMr. DIXON. Those are taken care of.

I understand the Senator from New York, [Mr. <T4>D'Amato</T4>], will offer an amendment on the death penalty for drugkingpins, a very narrow amendment carefully drawn. We would be willingto accept an hour's time agreement on that amendment.I am not certain now what the majority leader has in mind, how we can acceptthat and still have final passage unless it is freestanding and then Iam not certain what we get into there.[S13MY8-1021]{S5772}NUNNMr. NUNN. What I suggest is not have final passage until that matter isdisposed of but hopefully we will work out some way of disposing of itone way or another. In other words, at least finish all the other amendmentsrather than leaving all of them hanging, and then we have to figure outa way to deal with that.[S13MY8-1022]{S5772}BYRDMr. BYRD.

And germane.[S13MY8-1023]{S5772}BYRDMr. BYRD. And germane to the first-degree amendment.So, Mr. President, on the condition that any amendment pertaining to capitalpunishment, if such is offered, then therefore the time for the final voteis no longer valid and provided further that the Foreign Relations Committeemay meet on Monday and that the Intelligence Committee may meet on Monday.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?[S13MY8-1024]{S5772}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.The Senator from Arkansas.[S13MY8-1025]{S5773}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am sorry. Let the minority leader go ahead.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has reserved the right toobject.[S13MY8-1026]{S5773}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object just to make aninquiry of the majority leader.It would be the majority leader's intention, as I understand the request,that we would dispose of all these amendments and time agreements and thatthere would be an opportunity for the Senator from New York to offer hisamendment_I mean there would not be any effort to foreclose him from offeringhis amendment on Monday.[S13MY8-1027]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD. No.[S13MY8-1028]{S5773}DOLEMr. DOLE. And the majority leader has an amendment, too, I think.[S13MY8-1029]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD. I have one, but I presently do not plan to offer it. I plan tovote for anybody who has a capital punishment amendment. I will vote forthat almost sight unseen. I say that facetiously. I will support it. But let me finish. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The majority leaderhas the floor. The Senator from Kansas reserved the right to object. [S13MY8-1030]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD. Let me put it this way: Provided if the amendment, if such isoffered, on capital punishment be the final amendment and, of course, ifthat amendment is offered then the agreement, insofar as a time for a finalvote, is no longer valid. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent request?[S13MY8-1031]{S5773}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just for clarificationpurposes.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas reserves the right to object.Does the Senator from Kansas still press his reservation? [S13MY8-1032]{S5773}DOLEMr. DOLE. I want to ask one additional question. Earlier I suggested thevote on final passage occur at 10 o'clock Tuesday. Is that not satisfactory?[S13MY8-1033]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President. I modify my request to make that vote occuron Tuesday at 11 o'clock on a final passage vote. The remainder of theagreement as previously stated is standing as declared. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request is modified to havethe vote at 11 o'clock on Tuesday. There was another request from the Senator from Arkansas. [S13MY8-1034]{S5773}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I wish to engage the majority leader in a couplethings. No. 1, reserving the right to object_and I hope I will not have to__ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas reserves the right toobject. [S13MY8-1035]{S5773}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. I did not understand when we would be coming in Monday andI was unable, as the majority leader went through his request, to computehow much  time we were allocated. I have an amendment which the distinguishedchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the Senator from Maine andI discussed that I want to offer in which we may be able to work out witha colloguy, but it is extremely important that I offer it and we have acolloquy.Hopefully, we will not have to go to a vote on it. But I do want to makecertain that we have an opportunity to offer the amendment. I think wecan dispose of it in no more than 15 minutes. Senator <T4>Cohen </T4>is a cosponsor of the amendment, along with several others.[S13MY8-1036]{S5773}NUNNMr. NUNN. We certainly are prepared to discuss that amendment with theSenator and, if necessary, vote on it. We may be able to solve it simplywith a dialog.Let me say we are willing to come in early Monday morning at whatever timethe majority leader says and begin with whoever can be here and go lateMonday night. So we are not going to try to freeze anyone out.The question is just trying to nail down a time certain for final passage.Otherwise, we will never get through with this bill.[S13MY8-1037]{S5773}BUMPERSMr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, I concurin everything that the floor manager has said, but I know, as he has saidmany times that there may be a lot more amendments here Monday morningthan there are right now, and we do not have an agreement to eliminateamendments. I was wondering if the majority leader would consider addingmy amendment with 15 minutes, equally divided.[S13MY8-1038]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President, I make that modification to my request.[S13MY8-1039]{S5773}DOLEMr. DOLE. Is that an amendment that is already on our list?[S13MY8-1040]{S5773}BYRDMr. BYRD.

Iknow Senator <T4>Cohen </T4>and the rest of us can. So maybe we ought to make it 20minutes, equally divided.[S13MY8-1043]{S5773}BYRDMr. <T4>BYRD. </T4>Very well, I so modify the request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is modified to 20 minutes, equally divided,on the Bumpers-Cohen, and others amendment as part of the unanimous-consentrequest.There is a unanimous-consent request pending by the majority leader, whohas the floor.[S13MY8-1044]{S5773}EXONMr. EXON.

The majority leader has included that in the unanimous-consentrequest.The Senator from Kansas further reserves the right to object.[S13MY8-1047]{S5773}DOLEMr. DOLE.

And any amendment thereto that is germane to the amendmentin question?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please repeat that.[S13MY8-1060]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.[S13MY8-1061]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Is it my understanding each of these amendments is subjectto an amendment, a germane amendment in the second degree?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.[S13MY8-1062]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD. That is correct.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Germane and relevant.[S13MY8-1063]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I do not know some of these amendments. Could I inquire ofthe distinguished manager of the bill if any of them deal with my basicproblem, which is the amendments on this bill<ITAG tagnum="80">that attempt to modify provisions that are in existing law that cameabout by virtue of the continuing resolution? </ITAG>I know I have the ones that you and I have discussed previously. Thereare four there that do that, that pertain to issues in the bill. [S13MY8-1064]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. Those are all eligible to be brought up. [S13MY8-1065]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Are any of these_just say SDI or DDG 51 or the others, dothey deal with this bill or do they deal with the appropriations bill thatwas enacted last fall? [S13MY8-1066]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am informed that there is a DDG 51 provision that was in theappropriations bill, and there is a provision dealing with that same subjectmatter in this bill. [S13MY8-1067]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I know. That is why I mentioned it. [S13MY8-1068]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. That is right. [S13MY8-1069]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. My purpose is to see whether any Member is going to offeran amendment here that attempts to deal with the existing law which camefrom the continuing resolution we passed last fall, the portion that dealtwith the defense appropriations. To my knowledge, there are five issues that have been raised here on thefloor so far. These amendments that we are clearing now deal with thatprovision of law which already exists, rather than deal with this bill.Are there any others? [S13MY8-1070]{S5774}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield? [S13MY8-1071]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am informed__ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor. There is a reservationof objection by the Senator from Alaska.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator fromGeorgia be allowed to respond so I can remove my reservation of objection.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? [S13MY8-1073]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD. I temporarily withdraw my request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is temporarily withdrawn. The Senator from Alaska has yielded to the Senator from Georgia. [S13MY8-1074]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I merely had the floor on a reservation to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana. [S13MY8-1075]{S5774}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, replying to the Senator from Alaska on thequestion of the DDG 51 and the SDI amendment, those were two amendmentswhich I have. First, the SDI amendment I do not expect to be brought up and, in any event_well,I will not bring up the SDI amendment. Second, on the DDG 51 amendment, it relates to an amendment to languageput in this armed services bill relating to the conditions under whicha competitive bid might be frustrated by action of the Navy. It is a verynarrow question. [S13MY8-1076]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am interested in that. That was a compromisethat this Senator helped work out last year. If the Senator from Louisianaand the Senator from Mississippi are involved in that, then I will standback from that. I merely wanted to see to it that we do not have come up an amendment atthe last minute that is on this list that is not subject to any debateat all that people might not understand that would not be dealing withthis bill but dealing with appealing an existing law that Congress passedlast fall. I am trying to protect what we have already got in being andthe ability to spend that money in this fiscal year. If there is no other provision, I will not object. [S13MY8-1077]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a brief response? [S13MY8-1078]{S5774}STEVENSMr STEVENS. Yes. [S13MY8-1079]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, with the exception of the DDG 51 issue, whichhas been joined between several Senators__ [S13MY8-1080]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I am out of that now. I understand that. [S13MY8-1081]{S5774}NUNNMr. NUNN. And with the exception of those provisions the Senator has addressedthrough his amendments, I am not aware of any others that are in that category.[S13MY8-1082]{S5774}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I do not object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.   [S13MY8-1083]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I temporarily yielded the floor so that therecould be free debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe that has been completed. Does the Senator from Vermont seek recognition? [S13MY8-1084]{S5774}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Very briefly, Mr. President, I do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. [S13MY8-1085]{S5774}LEAHYMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I realize the UC has been temporarily withdrawn.I just want to thank the majority leader for this usual courtesy of protectingmy 10 minutes. If there is a new one put in on the Bumpers-Leahy-Chafee-Heinz,et al. amendment, I still would want 10 minutes, especially if it doesnot go to a rollcall. I would want that 10 minutes to make very clear whythis is something we have worked on for 5 years. I am sure the distinguishedchairman and majority leader understands, but I appreciate his courtesyin protecting that 10 minutes. [S13MY8-1086]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. [S13MY8-1087]{S5774}BYRDMr. BYRD.

But first let me get consentto be sure_aside from the other requests_that the Judiciary Committee,the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Armed Services Committee, and theIntelligence Committee be permitted to meet on Monday during Senate business.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? [S13MY8-1091]{S5774}DOLEMr. DOLE. Provided, I think as we said, the hearing be limited to INF testimonyin Intelligence, Foreign Relations, and Armed Services.

Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.The Senator from Indiana.[S13MY8-1093]{S5774}QUAYLEMr. QUAYLE. Mr. President, let me just say that in relationship to theBumpers-Leahy et al. amendment, that as far as a discussion and debateon that amendment I do not have any problem with that but I would not beable to enter into a time agreement on that amendment. I think_at leastI thought I understood the original propounding of unanimous-consent requestwould be for that amendment. I would not be able to give consent to a timeagreement on the voting on that amendment.

Reserving the right to object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection.[S13MY8-1123]{S5775}LEVINMr. LEVIN. May I make inquiry of the majority leader? As part of this reservation,I did not hear in your unanimous-consent request this time that the lastamendment that would be handled under this unanimous-consent agreementwould be the D'Amato amendment. Was it the majority leader's intentionto change his unanimous-consent agreement, or given the way he phrasedit now, would he be willing to include that in his new unanimous-consentproposal?[S13MY8-1124]{S5775}BYRDMr. BYRD. The reason I did not include it in that fashion now is becausethe amendment is now pending and the reason I did not phrase it as earlier,as I had done, was so that if the Senate reaches the hour of 10 o'clockon Tuesday morning next and that amendment has not been disposed of, thetime agreement with respect to all other amendments would not be vitiated.I had earlier phrased the order in such a way that if that amendment, ifthe death penalty amendment were to be called up, essentially the restof the agreement would be vitiated. I do not want to do that. I want tokeep the rest of the agreement, but provide that when we reach that houron Tuesday morning next and any other amendments that are called up, therebe no time for debate on them and that hour for that purpose, namely, disposingof the death penalty amendment, will be extended accordingly.[S13MY8-1125]{S5775}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I make a parliamentary inquiry?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from Michiganstill has his reservation of his right to object.

Will the majority leader be willing to include in his unanimous-consentproposal that the D'Amato amendment be laid aside, that it be the lastamendment called up so we can dispose of all these other amendments, giventhe fact that you have now modified your unanimous-consent agreement toallow us to proceed until that amendment is disposed of?[S13MY8-1127]{S5775}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, I so modify the request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request is modified so thatthe D'Amato amendment will appear at the end after all of the other amendments.[S13MY8-1128]{S5775}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. On the basis of that last request, I object.The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend a moment so that theChair may be certain, this is the unanimous-consent request which has nowbeen proposed by the majority leader.Now the Chair will go to the Senator from Alaska. Does he have either anobjection or a reservation to an objection?[S13MY8-1129]{S5775}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. My objection is that the D'Amato amendment is a pending amendment,and I object to it being automatically set aside until the end. We cantake it up on Monday or Tuesday since it is the pending business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has objected to the unanimous consent.[S13MY8-1130]{S5775}STEVENSMr. STEVENS. I have no objection to any other portion of that agreement.We are trying to work it out so we can debate that death penalty amendmentand have it be debatable before this time agreement expires, which I thinkis a privilege the Senator from New York and others have now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Senator's reservation. The Chair understandsit. There has been an objection made. The pending order of business isto complete the reading of the amendment.

I wonder if we could settle down just a little bit to let ourtempers cool and let our blood pressure lower itself a bit and see if wecan work our way out of this.Let me say in all the pandemonium that we were having here, the objectionto call off the reading of an amendment cannot carry with it a reservation.A Senator has to either object or not, as in the case of calling off aquorum. One cannot reserve the right to object to calling off the quorum.He either has to object or not.Mr. President, here is what I would like to do. On Monday after these committeeshave met, the Foreign Relations Committee and the Intelligence Committee,if in the judgment of the chairmen and ranking members, or at least I willmake the decision but I want to hear what they have to say with respectto the INF Treaty, and I want to start on that treaty Tuesday, or at somepoint on Tuesday_if in the judgment of the chairmen, and they report tome on that basis, they think the matters that were in dispute have beenclarified to their satisfaction and in the best interests of this country,then I want to get started on that treaty.In am prepared to do that. I am prepared to make the decision to go forwardbased on their recommendations after they have had adequate hearings, butnow we cannot go forward if we just are going to continue to squabble overthis bill. I think we ought to just stay here this evening, and if necessaryI will cancel my being in a parade in Beckley tomorrow. We will eitherget an agreement or we will be here tomorrow.Those who have been kind of putting the gentle pressure on this Senatorto move forward on the treaty, I need a little help out of them. So letus get an agreement on this bill. It is simple.I would ask that there be a final vote on Tuesday morning at 10 o'clocka.m., and that the time limitations on the amendments by Mr. <T4>Johnston, </T4>Mr. <T4>Domenici, </T4>and Mr. <T4>Bingaman </T4>be as heretofore stated, and that paragraph 4, rule XIIbe waived, and that all other amendments be disposed of, one way or anotherif they are called up, whereupon the hour of 10 o'clock a.m. on <ITAG tagnum="80">Tuesday having arrived as to the amendment dealing with the deathpenalty the Senate would then proceed on that amendment until disposedof; with one further proviso, that if all other amendments have been disposedof prior to 10 o'clock a.m. on Tuesday, the Senate in the meantime couldproceed with the death penalty amendment because that would be the lastone. That is the last amendment. </ITAG>In other words, we might proceed with that amendment on Monday eveningat 6 o'clock if all other amendments have been disposed of. But if theyhave not been disposed of, reaching the hour of 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning,the Senate is on that amendment, and it will be on that amendment untilit is disposed of, and we would not go to the INF Treaty until that isdisposed of. I am for that amendment. But I am not for letting that amendment keep ushere indefinitely. There will come a time when I will do what I can to move this bill anddispose of it, and dispose of that amendment as well. So I am ready to renew the request. I would like to hear from the Republicanleader, if he has any problem with this. I would like to know what it is.[S13MY8-1194]{S5778}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, the only problem I have_and I think we shouldhave an agreement worked out. I do not believe the Senator from New Yorkhas ever indicated he was going to stand here until 10 o'clock Tuesdaymorning and debate the death penalty. I think what we would like to dofrankly is to bring it up, spend a little time Monday afternoon, and inthe meantime, we keep setting this aside. In fact, I can guarantee thatwill happen. We can have a little debate sometime on Monday, and then doprecisely what the majority leader is suggesting. But I did not know therewas ever any agreement that we had to finish this bill before we went tothe INF Treaty. It was my understanding that we would do as much as wecould. There has been remarkable progress on this bill by the managersand others. The majority leader deserves a great deal of credit. But Ido not recall any agreement being made that we had to finish this billbefore we took up the INF agreement. I can see the pressure being brought to bear on anyone who has an amendmentleft, and say now you are holding up the INF agreement. The argument canbe made that those who opposed the death penalty are holding up the INFagreement. I think it will work out if we just let_I think I can speak for the Senatorfrom New York. He is not going to stand here as gatekeeper. I think heis perfectly willing to let me as the Republican leader exercise judgmentbut I do think he would like to have a little time on Monday during latehours to speak about the amendment, and not be in the position where someonewill say, I think unfairly, that if he did not get off that amendment at10 o'clock on Tuesday then he, Senator <T4>D'Amato, </T4>was holding up progress on the INF agreement. He doesnot want to do that. It is not his intention. But it is an important amendment,one that I support and one that the majority leader probably supports,one that I think the majority would support.But there is going to be a minority here trying to squeeze that amendmentout because of an effort to get a time agreement. I am not certain thatwe have to give anybody veto power because they happen to represent theminority view. But I do believe if we could just agree on everything exceptthat part where the D'Amato amendment would come at the end, we are notgoing to have any problem.[S13MY8-1195]{S5779}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Republican leader makes a goodpoint. It is a reasonable and reasoned point that he makes with respectto what I have said in regard to not proceeding with the INF Treaty untilthis has been disposed of. I am willing to work in a reasonable fashionto try to get to the INF Treaty once the decision has been made. Senatorsknow that I have been under pressure to go to that. I have refused to bendto pressure, and I will continue to refuse to bend to pressure on thatmatter because I have a very deep sense of what I think the duty of theSenate is under the Constitution. I want the Senate to be protected, andinsofar as I can, I will protect the Senate in carrying out its role, regardlessof the pressure.I was hoping that some of those who have been putting the pressure on mein a very gentle way to relent and get on with the treaty would help usif they could to dispose of the bill that is before us.The problem with having the amendment in a temporarily laid aside statusis simply this: That a single objection prevents the amendment from beinglaid aside. So it would be within the power of any Senator on Monday toprevent action on all the other amendments by simply objecting each timea new amendment is called up, objecting to further temporarily laying asidethe amendment by the distinguished Senator from New York [Mr. <T4>D'Amato</T4>]. That is the problem with temporarily laying aside. Itleaves him or me or any other Senator in full control of the Senate toprevent action on any other amendment on Monday as long as they want toobject to laying aside that amendment. The consequence would be then thatwe would reach the hour of 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning, and <ITAG tagnum="80">no other amendments had been disposed of, no other Senator had anopportunity to debate his amendment, and we would be at a point where thefinal vote would be prevented by calling up other amendments, voting onthem one after another and staying on the death penalty as long as we couldstand on our feet. </ITAG>[S13MY8-1196]{S5779}STEVENSMr. STEVENS.

This amendment is one that affects the Air Force's plans toremove five Air National Guard fighter interceptor detachments from strategicdefense alert status. This would include the 120th Fighter InterceptorGroup headquartered in Great Falls, MT, as well as units in Minnesota,Michigan, New York, and North Dakota. Vermont was on the list at one time,but has subsequently been excluded.The fighter plane units' mission is extremely vital in our defense of thenorthern tier of the United States. They are on a 5-minute alert, readyto go on a moment's notice to identify any unidentified objects which aredetected on radar lines in Canada and, if necessary, to intercept thatobject. If the Soviets sent a squadron of bombers over the North Pole,the fighter plane units would be our first line of defense.In view of such a vital mission, why would the Air Force want to deactivatethese units? They claim that the fighter planes are no longer needed becausethe radar surveillance line is being moved further north in Canada.Yet even though the Cadin Pinetree line was closed down on April 1, thereplacement systems are not yet in place. In fact, it is our understandingthat while portions of the North warning system are now functioning, otherparts will not be operational for quite some time_possibly as long as 2to 3 years. The over-the-horizon backscatter radar, which is intended primarilyto monitor traffic on the east and west coasts, will not be fully operationaluntil sometime in the 1990's.There has been some talk about relying on the Canadians to play a largerrole in our air defense, as well as other substitutes for the fighter planeunits, but there has not yet been a final decision made. I believe thatthe need for the air defense mission is obvious, and the Air Force shouldnot take any action to drawdown the units until Congress has the chanceto review the merits of the proposal.That is why we are offering an amendment that would prevent the Air Forcefrom taking these units off alert status until the replacement radar systemsare operational. Through means of a reporting requirement the Air Forcewould also be required to justify their actions to Congress before takingsteps to change the alert status.This amendment is similar to that adopted in the House of Representativeslast week as part of a block of so-called noncontroversial amendments.Without a sufficient replacement for the air defense mission, there isreason to be concerned about our capability to identify and intercept aSoviet plane or other enemy aircraft coming from the direction of the NorthPole. I also believe there is cause for concern that the deactivation of theair alert mission would harm the morale of the Air National Guard unitsby implying that they are not needed any more. The air defense missionis an important focus of the Air National Guard in my State. The 120th Fighter Interceptor Group has won a number of prestigious awardsin competition against units of the regular Air Force. In 1985 they bestedunits of the regular Air Force to win the Hughes Trophy, which is awardedfor overall performance during the year. The award has only been won twiceby Air National Guard units in its 35-year history_the Montana Air NationalGuard achieved this in 1985, and the North Dakota unit was the other AirNational Guard unit to be so distinguished. The 120th won the William Tell Award twice_in 1974 and 1976_and placedsecond twice_in 1978 and 1982_in the only four times they competed. TheWilliam Tell is a weapons competition for air defense units which includesUnited States Air Force, United States Air National Guard, and Canadianunits. Our unit, the 120th, has now gone to F-16's, and so they no longer competein the William Tell Award. But I want to brag a little bit about the 120thinterceptor group. They are a hot outfit. We are proud of them. They havean outstanding record. They won the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award on three occasions_in 1975,1981, and 1986. That award is based on continued excellence over a periodof time. I am not only very proud of them, I think they are very necessary. I thinkthe same can be said of the feelings of the other Senators from Minnesota,North Dakota, Michigan, and New York, the five interests that are involved.I consider it imperative that the air defense remains on alert status untilwe are assured there will be a sufficient alternative. I urge adoptionof our amendment.

Sperryas Commander, 27 June 1947, with 74 `charter members'. The unit was equippedwith the P-51 `Mustang' aircraft, later designated the F-51. The firstencampment was held in June 1948 at Gore Field, with the unit winning itsfirst intra-unit competition, an air race with the Idaho Air Guard. OurP-51's attained the blazing speed of 368 MPH.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In April 1951, the 186th was mobilized for the Korean crisis withthe F-51. Some members deployed to George AFB, California, and others toValdosta, Georgia, for the duration of the conflict. The unit was reformedat Great Falls International Airport when the members came home in Decemberof 1952.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 186th became the first Air National Guard unit to be assignedthe F-86 `Sabre' in November 1953, establishing a pattern of `firsts' thathas continued to this day. The F-86 proved to be a highly reliable aircraft,and operated in the 600 MPH range. With this aircraft, the Montana AirNational Guard entered the Air Defense role it still proudly and efficientlyaccomplishes today.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With the transition to the F-89C `Scorpion' in August 1955, the unitentered the age of all-weather fighter interceptors. The 120th FighterGroup came into existence on 16 April 1956, and three and one-half yearslater the aircraft was updated to the F-89H, providing rocket and missilecapability. In March 1960 the first F-89J arrived, ushering in the ageof nuclear weapons capability. The model mounted over our main gate isthe only F-89J to ever fire a nuclear tipped `Genie' air-to-air missile.This historic event occurred over the desert at Indian Springs, Nevada,in July of 1957.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">September 1966 saw the appearance of the F-102A `Delta Dart', whichdominated Montana's Big Sky Country until April 1972. Again the 120th wasselected to receive a new aircraft, and the F-106A `Delta Dart' made itshome here.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During its stay, the F-106 was flown over 80,000 hours, participatedin four William Tell Weapons Competitions with the unit taking first in1974 and 1976, and 2nd in 1978 and 1982, against both active Air Forceand Air Guard units.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myselfand Senator <T4>Melcher </T4>cosponsored by Senator <T4>Boschwitz, </T4>Senator <T4>Burdick, </T4>Senator <T4>D'Amato, </T4>Senator <T4>Leahy, </T4>Senator <T4>Riegle, </T4>Senator <T4>Levin, </T4>Senator <T4>Conrad, </T4>and Senator <T4>Moynihan. </T4>This amendment simply limits the ability of the Secretary of the Air Forceto change the alert status of Air National Guard units in the NorthernUnited States until a report is made to Congress regarding the capabilitiesof the proposed strategic air defense radar systems.The amendment defers any action on alert status for 180 days after thereport is received, allowing Congress a chance to review the report.This amendment is necessary because the Air Force abruptly decided to endthe alert status of a series of Air National Guard bases in the northernsection of the United States.In April, Norad aburptly announced that it planned to deactivate the Canadianair defense indentification zone in May of this year in order to save fundsfor the cosntruction and operation of the updated north warning system.While my intention is not to question the logic behind the action of theAir Force, my concern is that in the haste of this decision certain implicationsof this budget saving measure may have been overlooked.While we spend billions on the strategic defense initiative, it appearsthat the defense of the North American Continent against air-breathingsystems is being slighted.The Air Force has based their planned action on the ongoing modernizationof our air defense system, including the over-the-horizon-backscatter radarsystem and the north warning system. The problem is that the Air Forcewants to terminate existing air defense arrangements before their modernizationplans are even near completion.Until the effectiveness of the scheduled changes are confirmed, it seemsunwise to downgrade the alert status at the northern tier interceptor bases.The report required in this amendment would address the vital issues ofhow and when implementation of modernization would affect forward deploymentof U.S. interceptors, and in particular clarify the alert status of ournorthern tier Air National Guard bases.This amendment would maintain the intercept alert status for the northerntier bases until Congress has an adequate opportunity to review the AirForce plans. The House of Representatives passed a measure that limitsAir Force action until the modernization is complete.I personally support such a long-term deferment of alert status changes.My amendment addresses the concerns shared by many of my colleagues aboutthe Air Force plans while the Secretary has a chance to fully explain hisplans.I would like to add one fact for the benefit of my colleague. The Air NationalGuard bases affected by this decision are in Michigan, New York, NorthDakota, Montana, and Minnesota.I am sure all the units involved are very capable but in the case of the148th Fighter Interceptor Group based at Duluth, MN, the Air Force hasa unit recognized for its accomplishments in 1987.The 148th received the Air Force's Outstanding Unit Award for 1987, anaward based first and foremost on readiness. It is terribly ironic thatthe Air Force wants to take away the alert status for a unit just honoredfor its superb mission fulfillment.I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.[S13MY8-1240]{S5782}BOSCHWITZMr. BOSCHWITZ. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment whichwill prevent a premature and ill-advised proposal by the Air Force. AirForce plans to close the northern tier air alert at Air National Guardunits in Minnesota, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Montana, and Vermontought to be a matter of concern beyond the six States directly affected.Indeed, it concerns our national strategic defense posture. Currently approximatelyone unknown aircraft a week crosses the northern air defense identificationzone [ADIZ] which spans the northern border of Canada. If the northerntier air alert is eliminated as the Air Force proposes, only two bases_locatedin Canada_will remain with the capability to intercept and indentify unknownaircraft along our northern tier. In the ADIZ, the Air Force is phasing out the old DEW line radar and implementingtwo new systems, the northern warning system and the over-the-horizon backscatterradar. But these systems will not be fully deployed until 1992, leavingus with a serious weakness in our air defense until that time. No othermajor power tolerates such a soft spot in its strategic defenses. The Sovietsplace particular emphasis on such defenses_and it is the Soviet war plannerwe are trying to deter. The Minnesota Air National Guard passed a resolution last April urgingthe Air Force to develop a plan to identify and intercept unknown aircraftcrossing the ADIZ, using aircraft from the current air alert sites withsupport from tankers and AWACS aircraft. I believe that this is a planworth pursuing_but to do so we must maintain the northern tier air alertunits on the northern tier. The cost savings from closing the northern tier would total $3.5 million_orone one-hundred thousandth of the defense budget. I hope that the Senatewould not allow a gaping hole in our air defenses for such minimal savings.The House has passed an amendment, offered by Mr. <T4>Bonior, </T4>which will require the Air Force to justify the reasonsfor its proposal before the authorizing and appropriations committees andother interested Members before they move forward. I welcome and give myfull support to similar action here in the Senate. [S13MY8-1241]{S5782}CONRADMr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Durenberger amendment.This amendment temporarily suspends Air Force efforts to change the alertstatus of our northern tier Air National Guard units until Congress isnotified exactly of what changes will take place and how they will be implemented.We are currently in the process of consolidating our efforts with Canadafor the monitoring of our northern airspace. I do not believe it makessense to abandon our northern defense to Canada. Even if I were to acceptthis consolidation, it makes no sense to shut off our northern defensesbefore full operational capability has been achieved in the north warningsystem and over-the-horizon backscatter radar system which we will sharewith Canada. My concern is with our interim defense capability since thesenew systems will not be fully operational until 1992 and the existing radarsystems along our northern border with Canada are currently being dismantled.The Durenberger amendment requires the Air Force to report to Congresson the implementation and operational capability of these new systems;describe plans for the forward deployment of U.S. interceptor aircraftduring national alerts; clarify the alert status of Air Force elements,including Reserve components, in the northern areas of the United States;and describe the radar system to be used in 1989 to monitor the airspacein the northern United States and in Canada for strategic air defense.Mr. President, it appears to me that there will be at least a partial gapin the strategic defense of the northern United States for some periodprior to the full operational capability of the north warning system in1992. Any gap in our strategic defense simply cannot be permitted. Thisamendment will suspend any changes in our alert interceptor capabilityuntil the Air Force fully documents and explains to the Congress all pendingchanges and the impact of these changes.[S13MY8-1242]{S5783}EXONMr. EXON. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion on the amendmentthat has just been offered by the Senator from Montana. We have agreedto accept the amendment on this side. I have discussed this at some lengthwith my counterpart, Senator <T4>Thurmond</T4> of South Carolina, the ranking member of the StrategicSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee.We have some concerns with this that I think is proper that I express atthis time.No. 1, this is a very classic case, Mr. President, of how difficult itis to close down anything where the military establishes any kind of abase or a facility. I think it is a forerunner for the difficulties thatwe might experience when and if that committee that we are appointing inthis bill ever comes to grips closing down military bases around the country.They are a very viable part of the individual community.I certainly agree with the Senator from Montana that the Air Guard in Montanais an outstanding one. The job that the Air Guard has done in playing theimportant role that they do play in the surveillance of the northern partof this country is critically important.The reason that this action was taken by the Air Force was simply thatthey are beginning to phase down the responsibilities of the Air Guardat their particular present locations. And they are doing that becauseof a new surveillance system that is far superior to the one that we havenow that would direct these National Guard aircraft that are standing onalert duty around the clock. They would be likely moved in the future toother locations to stand by rather than where they are now for strategicpurposes.So I simply say that there is no question that, when the new system comesinto being, they are not going to be needed at the present locations. Iwould simply also remind the Senate that while this has reference to along period of time, this is a 1-year authorization bill. We intend tohold hearings in the Strategic Subcommittee. I am committed to do that,as is the ranking member of the committee, my friend and colleague fromSouth Carolina. We will be holding hearings on this matter next year todetermine how much we need in the future in this particular area_all orpart thereof or none. We will be making a recommendation, pro or con_afterwe receive the required information from the Air Force and, certainly,from the Guard, to get their important input this_with regard to the followingyear funding after fiscal 1989, which this measure covers.[S13MY8-1243]{S5783}MELCHERMr. MELCHER.

I think it has been cleared on both sides. I think everybody agrees wewant to make deep cuts in existing nuclear weapons and START negotiationsare aimed at achieving cuts in a way that will be effectively verifiableand stability enhancing. Last week, in fact last Wednesday, four of us were in Geneva and we metwith the Russian negotiators and met with our own negotiators. I was veryinterested in the Russians' effort to bring in nonnuclear cruise missilesinto any START agreement. I think we need this amendment. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.It sends a signal to our negotiators that we do not want to give them up.They should not be part of START. We need to keep our goals in mind. Weare trying to cut strategic nuclear weapons. We are not trying to foreclosenonnuclear options which may become all the more important under the STARTregime. The need for strong deterrent forces will not go away with the signingof an arms control agreement. There are a lot of experts in this, manymore expert than I, but according to our negotiators, cruise missiles offerone of the most promising avenues for nonnuclear defense technology. Yeteach day they go to the sessions they face the Soviets' attempts to includecruise missiles of any type in START limitations. I think we have correctly opposed this and I want the administration tocontinue to oppose this.Mr. President, although we may differ on the path to follow, I believethere is broad consensus in this room_indeed across America_for deep cutsin existing nuclear weapons. Start negotiations are aimed at achieving such cuts in a way that is effectivelyverifiable and stability enhancing. I had the opportunity to meet withour START negotiators last week. I believe they are doing a great job,and I wish them luck.But as we negotiate START, we need to keep our goals clearly in mind. Weare trying to cut strategic nuclear weapons. We are not trying to foreclosenonnuclear options which may become all the more important under a STARTregime. The need for strong deterrent forces will not go away with thesigning of an arms control agreement.Cruise missiles offer one of the most promising avenues for nonnucleardefense technology. Yet each day our negotiators face Soviet attempts toinclude cruise missiles of any type in START limitations. The United Stateshas correctly opposed this.

Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment I am proposingon behalf of myself and cosponsors, Senators <T4>Glenn, Bond, </T4>and <T4>Durenberger. </T4>This amendment requires the Secretary of Defenseto study the Department's use of disposable plastics during fiscal year1989 and to report the feasibility, availability, and cost variance ofsubstituting agricultural commodity based biodegradable plastics in placeof the traditional plastics. A year ago I introduced S. 970, the Alternative Agricultural Products ResearchAct of 1987, which is designed to promote research into nonfood uses ofagricultural crops. With such research, we can open up entirely new marketsfor products which are, in many cases in oversupply. Although much research is needed to fully maximize the potential for thesenew uses for crops, a number of exciting new products are already beingdeveloped. One of the most intriguing of these products is a new biodegradableplastic. Some of my colleagues may remember the sample biodegradable plastic bagI delivered to Senators last December. Since World War II, the growth of the plastics industry has been astounding.This extremely versatile substance has become an indispensable part ofour everyday lives. Last year, according to industry estimates, the UnitedStates used approximately 1 billion barrels of petroleum, enough to meetthe Nation's demand for imported oil for 5 months, just for the manufactureof plastic_60 billion of them. The plastic manufacturing industry has invested fortunes in producing andmarketing products such as garbage bags, touting their strength and indestructibility.However, as may so often be the case, one man's fortune can be anotherman's folly. From shore to shore all over the world, not only our beachesbut our streets, our yards, our fields and our rivers are suffering theburden of plastic discards_bottles, bags, cups, wrappers, sacks, you nameit. Not only do they blight the beauty of our nature, but in far too manyinstances, entanglement in or ingestion of plastics kills birds, fish andother wildlife.With a concerted effort, we could and should do a better job of collectingthese plastic discards. But even those plastics which are handled properlypose a difficult problem for solid waste managers. These indestructibleplastics can, according to scientists, last 200 years or more before theybegin to decompose. What do we do in the interim? As we wait for theirdisintegration, piles of discarded plastics continue to grow.We collect discarded plastics but what do we do with them? As the infamous``garbage barge'' showed, our landfills are being stretched to the limit.Because of the complicated makeup of plastics, many are not recyclable.If we incinerate them, we run the risk of contaminating our air.But, growing in our fields, right under our noses, there may be a solutionto the problem. Last year, American farmers produced 7.1 billion bushelsof corn. Scientists are virtually certain that many of the items that canbe made from the molecular ribbons of carbon and hydrogen that form petroleumcan also be manufactured from corn starch, which also consists of longchains of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms.The idea is to come up with a plastic that is programmed to degrade. Ithas been found that one ingredient to initiate the degradation of plasticsis corn starch. Mix in enough of it and the heftiest plastic bag will disintegrateafter a few years. The technology is really not that new. It can be tracedback to the mid to early 1970's and an emerging industry is beginning toproduce commercially viable, biodegradable plastic products.Scientists now believe that the same 60 billion pounds of plastic thatwere produced last year with 1 billion barrels of oil, could potentiallybe made with 3 billion bushels of corn. To meet the need, we would haveto expand corn acreage by at least 30 percent. Surpluses would disappear.The reality of this happening is still off in the future, but if properlystudied and researched, it could happen and it might just be timed whenoil prices have begun another upswing.At this time, the technology does not exist to make all plastics degradable,nor would it be prudent to do so. There are, however, many products whichcan and would best be made from biodegradable plastics_especially productssuch as packaging materials and plastic bags which are used temporarilyand then discarded. It is precisely these products that we should be pursuingwith these new technologies.This amendment requiring a study of the use of biodegradable plastics inappropriate sectors within DOD will give us a basis to know how feasibleit might be to begin use of these plastics in the limited area of disposables.Some States have laws requiring certain products be made of degradableplastics, and other nations have moved to the forefront in confrontingthe plague of plastic waste. Italy, for example, has already passed a lawrequiring that next year all bags used for packaging and containers forliquid food products must bear a mark enabling the identification of thematerial they are made of and warning not to dispose of them in the environment.The law further specifies that they must be degradable or recyclable.My point in all this is that we should be doing more faster and be doingit now. We can start now with this amendment.By requiring that information be gathered and a report made on the matter,we can begin to form a basis to boost an important new technology, improveour agricultural economy, take another step in reducing our reliance onoil imports, and attack the problem of plastic pollution. I urge adoptionof this amendment.[S13MY8-1276]{S5785}GLENNMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator<T4>Harkin,</T4> in proposing this amendment before the Senate today. Ouramendment to direct the Department of Defense to study the use of agriculturalcommodity-based biodegradable plastics by the Department of Defense addressesa subject that I have long supported. That is, the development of new nonfooduses for our Nation's agricultural commodities. Mr. President, the Department of Defense procures vast quantities of plasticsfor a wide variety of uses including plastic packaging, industrial containers,plastic bags, and food containers. It is therefore entirely appropriatethat the department study the potential for increasing the use of agriculturalcommodity-based plastics which would benefit our Nation's farmers by helpingto expand new markets for their products. It will also address the increasingproblem of the disposal of solid waste that so many of our cities facetoday. Our amendment also complements the Agricultural Commodity-based PlasticsDevelopment Act of 1988 that I recently introduced. This legislation willprovide incentives for private sector market development of degradableplastics through the preferential procurement of these products by theFederal Government with special emphasis on agricultural commodity-basedtechnologies. It directs the General Services Administration to identify,and make available to it's customers, degradable plastics products_$20million is authorized for each of 3 years to cover the additional costof procuring these items. It also establishes an interagency working groupto develop and coordinate the implementation of the act. This bill is scheduledfor hearings later this year and I know that many of my colleagues haveexpressed their support for it. The expanded use of degradable plastics addresses two important issuesfacing our Nation today. Namely, the return to health of American agriculture,and the serious environmental problem we face regarding the disposal ofplastic waste. These are complex problems that will not be solved quickly,rather they require a forward-looking strategy to help return our agriculturalcommunities to prosperity and to address this very serious environmentalconcern facing our Nation's cities.

Mr. President, the amendment I offer is a simple one intendedto stamp out the practice of ``insider bidding'' for Government contractsby Government employees. While insider trading has been condemned by thecourts, insider bidding has been condoned. The situation must be rectified.On February 2, 1988, the Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit held that no Federal policy was violated when a Federal employeebid on a defense procurement contract, provided that the employee on winningthe award terminated his Federal employment before receiving the award.In my opinion, the court applied Federal acquisition regulation 3.601,prohibiting awards to Government employees, in an overly technical manner,overlooking the conflict of interest the regulation seeks to protect against.Such a construction makes a mockery of the concept of ``competitive'' bidding.Is it fair if a Government employee, who may have inside information, isallowed to compete with outsiders? Is it fair that a Government employeewho bids on a contract may avoid the obligation, equally undertaken byall bidders, to perform the contract by simply refusing to quit his employment?In other words, the Government employee has a chance to review and reconsiderthe economic wisdom of his bid_to take a second look_while other biddersremain obligated to perform if their bid is accepted. Finally, is it fairfor a salaried Federal employee to compete against others who do not enjoyan equally secure position?While it may not be fair, it is the law. The Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit so decided on February 2, 1988, in the case of SpeakmanCo. versus Weinberger. In short, the Court of Appeals took the view thatFAR 3.601's prohibition of awards to Government employees applies onlyto the final stage of the competitive bidding process_the grant of theaward_rather than to the entire bidding process. This is surprising inview of the regulation's express purpose ``to avoid the appearance of favoritismor preferential treatment by the Government toward its employees.'' theCourt of Appeals considered the word ``award'' to be ``unambiguous'' andfound support for its position in the agency's similar view.The Speakman case I am informed, has run its course. No further appealsare planned. It is not my intention to change the outcome, as regrettableas it is. Rather, I wish to make sure that the conflict-of-interest policyis applied to the entire competitive bidding process. I wish to make surethat the Speakman case is not repeated. My amendment requires the Secretaryof Defense to issue regulations to apply the conflict of interest to bidsas well as awards.I urge the adoption of my amendment.[S13MY8-1285]{S5786}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Federal acquisition regulation prohibits acontracting officer from knowingly awarding a contract to a Governmentemployee or a business substantially owned or controlled by Governmentemployees. The purpose is to avoid conflicts of interest and appearancesof favoritism.The agency head can grant an exception where there is a compelling reasonto do so.Senator <T4>Roth</T4>'s amendment will establish a complete prohibition. His amendmentand his interest in this amendment arises from a case involving a Governmentemployee who bid on a contract. When informed of the conflict rule, heresigned upon award of the contract.

Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor this amendment withSenator <T4>Nunn</T4> to S. 2355 which provides for a significant step forwardin U.S. drug policy. This amendment clearly gives a defined mission forthe Department of Defense to defend our borders against all threats toour national security including the threat of drugs and drug smugglers.The role is one that is both natural and practical for the Defense Department_detectingintruders who cross our borders. Such intruders could be military threats,terrorists, cruise missiles, or drug smugglers_all of which are a directthreat to our national security. The DOD with its national detection systemis the logical entity in our Government to protect our borders. The systemin place has traditionally been aimed at detecting high-flying, high-speedaircraft. This amendment details the DOD's mission to detect all intrudersincluding those on the seas and those flying low and slow. Our amendment directs the President to designate DOD as the lead agencywithin the Federal Government for the detection and monitoring of all potentialair and sea drug transit into the United States. This designation meansthat DOD shall have control and authority over the detection of all drugtransit activities within the Federal Government which hopefully will eliminatemuch of the duplication, confusion, and gaps which currently exist. Italso means that DOD will perform a major role in creating a command, communications,and control network to provide necessary tactical information to civilianauthorities who are charged with the drug enforcement responsibilities.Mr. President, this mission is not only practical for the Defense Departmentfor reasons of logistics but also for reasons of cost. Yes, it will requiresome additional resources to completely and efficiently comply with themission we are bestowing on the Department of Defense. However, there isalready in place a substantial inventory of equipment and systems thatare currently owned or under the control of DOD. Such resources includefixed-based radar systems, radars-carrying aerostats, long-range surveillancecrafts, and control networks. The President is required to access any additionalneed for resources that are necessary to fulfill this mission of the DOD.This amendment also provides for the National Guard to be utilized by theGovernors of States for the purpose of drug enforcement. This amendmentprovides the Governors with funds for drug enforcement efforts by the NationalGuard. The amendment does not spell out those specific activities but recognizesthe diversity among State needs by requiring the Governors to submit Stateplans detailing the Guard's involvement in drug activities. Such activitiesmight include enforcement, surveillance, eradication, spot checks and searches,interdiction and training.Mr. President, I believe this amendment will help to shape a more effectivedrug policy for the United States. Many here in Congress and people throughoutAmerica are frustrated and frightened by the volume of drugs and the accompanyingviolence that now envelope our communities. Such frustration has resultedin a cry for more military support to combat drugs. But few define suchhelp. This amendment not only defines but enhances the military's rolein the drug detection arena. This mission should significantly assist inthe interdiction of drugs that cross our borders. The military is trainedand equipped to carry out this mission. And just as crucial, this missionwill assist the military in carrying out its charge to protect our citizensagainst all threats to our national security.Mr. President, I commend Senator <T4>Nunn </T4>and his staff for their leadership in developing this amendment.I am hopeful that this defined mission for DOD will be a first and importantstep in our efforts to define a clear and effective drug policy. The Americanpeople deserve no less.[S13MY8-1299]{S5787}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I must, with great reluctance, oppose thisamendment.I am as committed as any Member of this body to fighting_and winning_thewar against drugs.The drug problem is devastating our Nation. It is destroying the livesand futures of untold numbers of young Americans. It is infecting our communitieswith drug-related crime, gang violence, and a host of adverse consequences.But the question here is not whether we are going to engage in an all-outwar against drugs, but how we are going to do it.I am an original cosponsor of the omnibus antidrug legislation introducedearlier this year by the distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. <T4>DeConcini</T4>]_a bill that would strengthen enormously our nationaleffort to combat drug abuse.I joined in the unanimous vote last month to add $2.5 billion in budgetauthority to the fiscal year 1989 budget resolution because we are facinga dire emergency in this area. We need to provide the fiscal resourcesthat will help win this battle.I have repeatedly urged the Reagan administration to release drug assetforfeiture funds to local law enforcment agencies so that they can do thejob they are trying to do in fighting the drug problem in the streets ofour communities.I have urged the Reagan administration to assist these local communities_particularlyin California_in carrying out their law enforcement activities.But that is not what is at stake here. What is at stake in this amendmentis whether we are going to embark upon a new path in terms of the use ofthe military forces of the United States to carry out law enforcement activities.Mr. President, let me stress here that there are many, many supportiveroles that the military can fulfill in this area. I fully support theseactivities, such as using the military to guard our borders, sharing ofsurveillance information and providing necessary equipment to local lawenforcement agencies. What I cannot support is authorizing the use of the military to carry outthe law enforcement functions themselves. Specifically, the power to arrestAmerican citizens. The power to arrest citizens, in this society, is a civilian function.There are many nations in this world where the military provides a numberof law enforcement functions. The United States is not one of those nations, and I don't want to seeit become one. For 110 years, the law of this land has forbidden the military from takingon the law enforcement responsibilities of our civilian law enforcementagencies. We should not start down a different path today. Mr. President, when we give the military the authority to arrest civilianswe are using a tool of the police state. When we authorize the military to arrest civilians, we give the militarya role in our governance. That's a very, very dangerous step_one we've not taken before and shouldbeware of taking now. Too many nations that have taken that first step, the very step we arenow contemplating, have eventually found themselves subject to militarydomination of their politics. You have only to look at how military troops have been used to enforcethe law under Communist and fascist dictatorships. I am not saying that if we pass this bill we will become a military dictatorship.That's ridiculous.I am saying, however, that if we pass this bill we are taking a foolish,foolhardy step that could be used as a precedent_to the detriment of ourdemocracy_years from now.However worthy our objective, however limited the exercise of the arrestauthority we give the military, however concerned we may be about the drugmenace, and however anxious we are to take forceful action, we must notlet the ends are seeking pervert and undermine democratic means.We must not forget that our freedoms depend on the subordination of militarypower to civilian rule.What will it benefit us if in seeking to win the war against drugs we losethe sacred liberties of civilian Government?This bill needlessly sets us on a perilous path. A few hours ago, I had a group of police officers from California in myoffice. I asked them what they thought about the issue of using the militaryfor making arrests in drug cases.They said they did not support such an effort. They felt the military couldperform a very useful role in surveillance, and in passing on informationthey gather to the police.They pointed out, however, military personnel are not trained to carryout these functions. Even if the legislation says they must be trainedwe are still dealing with a force which has not been selected to carryout the delicate issues of law enforcement. In many cases, these servicemenare 18- and 19-year-olds, who have neither the experience, training, orjudgment to carry out these functions.This is not a responsibility that we should give to the military.Let us give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to do their jobadequately.I am also deeply concerned about the provisions of the amendment whichauthorize the use of military planes within the United States to interceptairplanes in order to direct them to land in locations designated by civilianlaw enforcement officials.I have been advised that the term ``intercept'' is intended to cover identificationand communication with such aircraft and is not intended to include firingupon or forcibly bringing such aircraft to the ground with military planes.I am nevertheless concerned that this still opens the door to militarycombative activities within the United States. I do not want to see militaryplanes firing weapons_even in self-defense_over the skies of our citiesor engaging in military action within our borders.I oppose the amendment.[S13MY8-1300]{S5788}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I had originally intended to offer an amendmentto this bill, on behalf of myself, Senator <T4>Boschwitz </T4>and others. This would be a short and straightforwardamendment that would establish conditions for implementation by the UnitedStates of a new nuclear-cooperation agreement with Japan that has not yetcome into force. The amendment would require no further negotiations orexchange of notes between the two governments, but it would ensure thatthe agreement will be carried out in a manner consistent with U.S. lawand vital American interests. The amendment seeks to accomplish four basic objectives. First it requiresthe President to advise Japan, prior to entry into force of the new nuclearagreement, that (a) nothing in the agreement detracts from the parties'unilateral suspension rights; (b) consent for reprocessing and plutoniumuse is premised on the continuing adequacy of safeguards and physical securitymeasures; and (c) United States cooperation is required for any air transportof plutonium. Second, on an annual basis and in connection with the inclusion of anynew facilities under the agreement's advance consent arrangements, thePresident must advise the Congress whether the criteria for ``subsequentarrangements'' contained in section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act are beingmet and, if they are not, must suspend any applicable advance consents.Third, plutonium overflights of the United States are barred, as are anyflights, regardless of routing, that do not meet the crashworthiness certificationrequirements for plutonium shipping casks, as spelled out in the Murkowski-Proxmireamendment that was enacted last year by Congress. Fourth, any future sea shipments of plutonium to Japan must be approvedon a shipment-by-shipment basis pursuant to requirements of section 131of the Atomic Energy Act. This amendment is necessary because of what the Reagan administration acknowledgesis the unprecedented nature and scope of the ``programmatic consent'' forreprocessing of spent fuel and utilization of the recovered plutonium,which Japan is accorded under the agreement. The long-term nuclear proliferationand terrorism risks associated with this arrangement are grave. Indeed,the agreement will authorize Japan to acquire more United States-controlledplutonium than now exists in the entire United States arsenal. In orderto ensure that U.S. national security, safety, and environmental interestsare protected, it is essential that clear guidelines be spelled out forimplementation of the agreement by the executive branch. [S13MY8-1301]{S5788}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am most sympathetic to your concerns. I have long been convincedthat the United States must do everything possible to protect against risksof nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism. While the Senate in Marchdeclined to disapprove this new nuclear cooperation agreement_and I myselfvoted against disapproval_I do not believe that the Senate's vote reflecteda judgment that additional conditions on implementation of the agreementto reduce such risks would be inappropriate. To the contrary, I and manyof my colleagues were concerned that other options were not available tothe Senate at that time. It is not inappropriate before the agreement comesinto force that we prepare some guidelines for implementation, as you haveproposed. I am concerned, however, that in the context of the Defense authorizationbill, we do not have the time to give your amendment the full considerationit requires. A number of colleagues will want to be heard on this matterand the hour is late. I am therefore pleased that you have agreed in our discussion to withdrawthe amendment with the understanding that we will work together with otherSenators to address this issue again before the new United States-Japanagreement enters into force. I am hopful that the President will work inthe interim closely with Members of Congress and listen carefully to suggestionsto strengthen the guidelines for implementation. Such an approach wouldhelp ensure that no misunderstanding arise between the United States andJapan concerning interpretation of how the obligations of each party willbe carried out. [S13MY8-1302]{S5788}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON. I appreciate the chairman's suggestions and <ITAG tagnum="80">the concerns you have expressed regarding proliferation and terrorismrisks.

This is one concernthat my amendment will resolve, both as to the routing of these shipmentsand as to the safety standards for shipping casks to be applied. This isall the more reason, therefore, for the administration to accede to ourrequest to await congressional action on implementing legislation. An additionaldelay of only a few weeks to bring the agreement into force is a smallprice to pay when we are talking about assuring that U.S. national security,safety and environmental interests will be protected over the 30-year lifeof the agreement.

Mr. President, one of the most critical requirements of theDOD is to expedite the research, test, and deployment capability of aneffective Asat capability. Contrary to the gospel preached continuallyby opponents of the United States gaining on Asat force, the Soviet Asatsystem is not crude and one-dimensional. It consists of four major components:A low-orbital satellite interceptor; the GALOSTI ABM interceptor; directedenergy weapons; and electromagnetic combat systems. The United States should not be standing still in the face of an ever-increasingSoviet capability. I am prepared to support efforts of the DOD to initiatethe relevant action to go forward with an aggressive Asat research program.For several years, the House has acted blindly and negatively toward Asat.Fortunately, some wisdom has been imported on that body this year and noban on Asat was enacted in the House on this year's authorization bill.I believe that the Senate could defeat any attempt to resurrect the Houseban in the Senate. The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill directs that the Secretary ofDefense develop a 5-year comprehensive plan on a United States Asat Programto counter the growing sophisticated Soviet system. Space shall not bea sanctuary for Soviet satellites. The current environment for our satellites_wherethey are subject to considerable risk_is a very destabilizing situation.A United States Asat system would provide the deterrent capability to protectour critical assets. The next step in the process for Asat is a strong endorsement of it bythe DOD and a credible program included with the budget submitted nextJanuary. I have been working very closely with the chairman and rankingminority members of our Armed Services and Intelligence Committees andwe all agree on the need for the Asat and expect it to be a key elementin the fiscal year 1990 budget. Mr. President, on April 28, I delivered a speech on the priority of a U.S.Asat Program. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be reprinted inthe <T4>Record</T4> at this point. I also ask unanimous consent that two letters to my distinguished colleague,Senator <T4>Nunn,</T4> the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, be printedin the <T4>Record.</T4> These letters clearly refute allegations made by Asatopponents that key DOD officials do not enthusiastically support Asat.The letters are authored by Vice Adm.

Nor do we expect thatthe sovereignty of our airspace of the airspace of our allies would bepreserved without strong air forces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We have also faced up to our responsibilities to counter Soviet intrusionsin Afghanistan, Angola, and, while not enough, we have supported the resistanceforces in Nicaragua who are fighting to restore freedom there.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In every case_on the land, at sea and in the air_we have had the wisdomto develop and deploy effective military forces, deterrent forces fullycapable of warfighting, postured and ready to exact a tremendous toll againstany aggressor. This is true in every case, and in every operational mediumexcept one: except in space. In wartime, space will belong to the SovietUnion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In plain language, the Soviets have the military systems that willallow them the uncontested control, the uncontested dominance of space,and we presently have nothing_not one thing_to oppose them there.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Today the Soviets have the world's only operational antisatellitesystems. They would like us to believe that their antisatellite systemsare ``crude'', and that the threat posed to our satellites is ``one-dimensional.''But, it is now clear from testimony given by our Nation's best militaryexperts_that the Soviet antisatellite threat is neither crude, nor one-dimensional.Let me review some of the facts with you.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviet coorbital satellite interceptor, launched on the SL-11booster, has been operational since 1972. Extensive Soviet testing of thissystem against objects in space has assured that it will have at leasta 50-percent ``probability of kill'', if employed against our low Earth-orbitingsatellites. By 1982 the Soviets had enough confidence in this system thatthey no longer needed to conduct full and visible integrated testing ofit against objects in space. In August 1983 they declared that they would``restrain'' from further ``testing'' of this already proven and alreadyoperational system, if the United States exercised similar restraint. Someof our colleagues here_and many more in the House_were seduced by thatspecious claim. And, as a consequence, the Soviets were handed a cheapbut significant victory. To the Soviets, the best situation is deterrenceof our will to resist them and their designs. This victory cost them nothing,except perhaps the price of a lie.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The truth of it is, that the Soviets continue to launch the SL-11booster with other payloads. The reliability of that launch vehicle isunsurpassed by any U.S. system. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent otherportions of the coorbital antisatellite system from being exercised separately,and in ways not visible to us.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have every confidence that_in fact_that is just what the Sovietsmay have done. And, the coorbital satellite interceptor is only one offour antisatellite technologies presently available to the Soviets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets also have an inherent direct ascent antisatellite capabilityin their ``galosh'' antiballistic missiles. By ``inherent,'' I mean thatthe missiles have the right combination of range, payload, and guidanceto allow them to be used in either an antiballistic missile role, or anantisatellite role. Of those two tasks_the destruction of ballistic missilereentry vehicles, or the destruction of satellites_by far the easier technologicaltask, is the destruction of satellites.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The capabilities that reside in these two ``hard kill'' or ``kinetickill'' systems_the coorbital interceptors and the ``galosh''_are complementedby Soviet directed energy and electronic warfare capabilities. At SaryShagan, the Soviets are estimated to have two lasers that are probablycapable of damaging components of our satellites in orbit. The launch pointsfor their kinetic kill antisatellite systems and their laser systems aregeographically spaced to provide multiple engagement opportunities againstour critical low Earth orbiting satellites each day. Soviet ground-basedlasers capable of being used in the antisatellite role, could also be complementedby more ground-based lasers, and even by space-based antisatellite lasersin the 1990's.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Soviet doctrine for war on land, at sea and in the air also postulatesthe need for a robust electronic warfare, or ``radio-electronic combat''capability. Lately the Soviets have openly discussed electronic warfareagainst our spacecraft as one of their potential ``asymmetric'' responsesto the strategic defense initiatives. We would be naive beyond belief,if we did not credit the Soviets with the wartime capability to disruptor degrade our satellites by using electronic warfare.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, the Soviets presently have at least four known antisatellitetechnologies to choose from: A system of coorbital satellite interceptors;numerous direct ascent missiles; ground-based lasers; and the technologicalcapability for antisatellite electonic warfare. No one should thoughtfullycall that kind of antisatellite threat ``crude,'' and it is clearly not``one dimensional.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the horizon are even more Soviet systems with antisatellite applications.Among these must be included radio frequency, or RF weapons, particle beamweapons, perhaps even a Soviet ``space plane'' and the Soviet space shuttle.The latter two could be developed and used to interfere with or to captureour satellites in wartime.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Facing present and future Soviet space control capabilities, and agrowing family of Soviet antisatellite technologies, we_the United States_havenothing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing but our reliance on the goodwill and restraint of the SovietUnion to leave our spacecraft alone in wartime_when the incentive for interferingwith them would be as high as the strategic advantage that would be thestrategic advantage that would be gained by denying us their use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing to protect our satellites_by increasing the risk to Sovietspace systems_should the Soviets contemplate or commence attacking them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nothing to protect our own soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines,should the Soviets use their satellites to target and to direct attacksagainst our forces in conflict. Nothing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We have created this unsatisfactory situation ourselves. That is foolhardy.But it is also perilous. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When no less authority than the Commander in Chief of our United Statesspace command tells us that his job is ``impossible,'' because he has noability to control space in crisis or conflict; when he warns us that ``wewill pay the price of our neglect in American lives'' because he will beunable to stop the Soviets from controlling space, from using that controlto operate those Soviet systems designed to locate and target our forces;when no less authority than the Chief of Naval Operations counsels us that``if we are going to win at sea, we must ensure that we win in space'',and; when no less authority than the Secretary of the Air Force tells usthat ``we have unilaterally given the advantage to the Soviets to controlspace in time of conflict,'' then we must seriously question wheher weare able_in good conscience_to disregard those stern warnings, that soundadvice based on scores of years of military and defense experience.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consider, if you will, what the Soviets could do_and most assuredlywill do_with undisputed control of space in a conflict. By attacking ourmilitary significant spacecraft with kinetic kill weapons and lasers, andby disrupting other space systems with electronic warfare, they could quicklydegrade our ability to exercise command and control over our forces byhindering communications, they could deny our forces and our leadershipcritical information of all kinds, and they could force us into ill-timedor inappropriate military operations. They could, in short, completelybury us in the ``fog of war.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Simultaneously, the Soviets would use their own clearly superior rapidlaunch capability to put even more Soviet surveillance and targeting spacecraftinto orbit. They would use these in an attempt to make our operations transparent,to find our convoys and our military formations, and to methodically attackthem or otherwise inhibit their effectiveness. We, for our part, wouldhave no way to challenge Soviet mastery of space, except to escalate theconflict on Earth. Clearly, this unsatisfactory state of affairs is intolerable,and must be changed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">What needs to be done to change it? The first need, the most urgentneed is for all of us to accept that space has become and will remain_whetherwe like it or not_a military arena of great strategic importance. We cannothope to meet our national security objectives, in peacetime or in conflict,without the ability to use space. Soviet rhetoric that laments and eschewsthe alleged ``militarization of space'' is nothing less that pure hogwash.Not only do the Soviets have more military spacecraft than we do, theyalso have an almost exclusively military space program. A program designedto meet their doctrinal requirement to achieve what they call ``masteryof space'' in the time of conflict.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If space is ``militarized'' by the presence of military systems, thenso is the land, the sea, and the air. We cannot allow ourselves to be deterredany longer by Soviet propaganda.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once we accept that the use of space is critical to our national security,we need to also accept that the Soviets will most certainly contest ourpresence there in conflict. They have the ability to do that today, ifthey so desire. Thus, our space systems need to have the ability to endurethere, even in the face of Soviet opposition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We need to have more spacecraft on orbit, and those need to be moresurvivable. However, there are physical limits to the amount of survivabilitythat can or should be built into our satellites. We can make satellitesmore survivable, but we cannot make them ``immortal.'' No military systemcan be made immortal, and we should not demand of satellites a level ofinherent survivability we do not demand from ships, or tanks, or aircraft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, and finally, the best way to protect our spacecraft and makethem survivable, is to have a credible deterrent Asat capability of ourown with the ability to hold at risk the military spacecraft of the SovietUnion. To do that we have a clear, compelling and_I believe_urgent needfor a U.S. satellite negation capability. We need to be able to hold threateningSoviet military spacecraft at risk in all the orbits where they operate.We also need a range of engagement systems or technologies, that wouldenable us to disrupt critical Soviet satellite functions at the lower levelof the spectrum of conflict, and promptly destroy a large number of Sovietsatellites at the higher levels of conflict.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A United States satellite negation capability would deter Soviet attackson our spacecraft, by giving us the significant ability to retaliate byattacking Soviet spacecraft. Should deterrence fail, a credible operationalUnited States antisatellite capability would help defend our own spacecraftand forces, by threatening or destroying Soviet war-supporting spacecraft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While Soviet space reconstitution capabilities make it more unlikelythat we could ever exercise absolute control of space, we must nonethelessat least strive to be able to dispute Soviet control, as the alternativeto the indisputable wartime inferiority in space that we presently wouldhave.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I should also stress what should be obvious: That we cannot have acredible antisatellite capability of any kind, unless candidate U.S. antisatellitesystems are subjected to realistic and comprehensive testing. We have sofrustrated the Department of Defense with short-sighted legislation impedingantisatellite testing, that we have effectively prohibited them from acquiringa much-needed and long-overdue deterrent and warfighting capability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I urge my colleagues to join me in demanding that the Department ofDefense set about immediately with acquisition of an effective and crediblesatellite negation capability, and one that can be made operational atthe earliest possible date. As an initial objective we should acquire thecapability to hold at risk all those low Earth orbiting Soviet spacecraftspecifically designed to locate and target our military forces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the same time, I urge my colleagues to exercise their considerableinfluence to ensure that acquisition of this validated military requirementis supported on both sides of the aisle, and both in the Senate and theHouse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We simply must develop and test capabilities_whether ground-, air-,or space-based_that will provide an effective deterrent to a Soviet monopoly.We need a credible, operational, U.S. antisatellite system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/><ITAG tagnum="52">Department of the Navy,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, May 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>Sam Nunn,</T4><ITAG tagnum="55">Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Washington, DC.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1306]{S5790}<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Dear Mr. Chairman:</T4> I am writing to inform you that Navy fullysupports limited testing of a kinetic anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon. Inthe next decade our country will require such a weapon to be capable ofdestroying Soviet space-based surveillance and targeting systems, and todeter Soviet attacks against our own space systems. ASAT testing againsttargets up to 800 miles is a reasonable approach, allowing the Departmentof Defense to develop a low earth orbit (LEO) ASAT comparable to the Soviets'demonstrated capability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirement for an ASAT emerged as we saw the Soviets improvingand expanding their space systems. Through the early part of this decade,Soviet satellites designed to search for and target ships had only rudimentarycapabilities. Since that time, the Soviets have pursued a well-financedeffort to expand and diversify their space-based maritime surveillancecapabilities.

The quote used duringthe floor debate was taken completely out of context from a response Imade in March to a question raised at a forum on space and national security.I believed then, as I do today, that the United States must have an antisatellitecapability to counter the demonstrated Soviet antisatellite systems.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of theArmed Services Subcommittee on Defense Industry and Technology in a briefcolloquy on the subject of a very important new technology being pursuedby the Department of Defense and supported by our committee.[S13MY8-1309]{S5791}BINGAMANMr. BINGAMAN. I would be happy to join in this discussion with the distinguishedSenator from New Hampshire.[S13MY8-1310]{S5791}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, as my colleagues on the Armed Services Committeeare aware, the rapid advancement of electronic technology has been a keydriver in our ability to field state of the art weapons systems to meetcurrent and future threats. For more than 8 years, our committee has supportedthe Defense Department's efforts to encourage the development of very highspeed integrated circuit [VHSIC] technology for utilization in a diverserange of electronic warfare and sensor applications. With the bill beforeus, we now have the opportunity to build on the VHSIC experience by supportingthe next generation of advanced computer chips called microwave/millimeterwavemonolithic integrated circuits, or MIMIC for short. These new chips usea gallium arsenide semiconductor material which functions faster than conventionalsilicon and can operate at the microwave frequencies used by radar, communications,and electronic defense systems. I think the Senator will agree this newgeneration of advanced chips shows great potential for timely and cost-effectiveinsertion in future military systems.[S13MY8-1311]{S5791}BINGAMANMr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct in the importance he attaches to MIMICas the next development phase of integrated circuit technology. In my view,MIMIC represents a quantum leap in this critical area and is essentialfor meeting a range of system requirements in the 1990's. We noted duringthe course of our review of the President's budget submission for 1989that a 5-year, multiphase development program with a funding profile of$500 million was initiated in 1987 by the Department of Defense as a joint-serviceprogram. Affordability, availability and generic applicability of MIMICtechnology are the primary goals of this program. The preliminary effort,involving program definition and the identification of important systemapplications, has already been completed. The next phase, to develop MIMICtechnology and provide brassboards for the major DOD systems, is plannedfor 3 years with expenditures of some $240 million. This year the Departmentrequested $67.1 million for MIMIC, unfortunately, due to funding constraints,our committee was unable to fund the request and reduced it by $14.5 million.[S13MY8-1312]{S5791}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. Chairman, I realize funding is constrained in the currentbudget environment and understand the problems your subcommittee facedin reaching their funding targets. I understand, however, that at thisstage the program appears to be well-managed by the Department of Defenseand is on track with respect to cost and schedule objectives. Would theSenator agree with this assessment of the MIMIC Program status?[S13MY8-1313]{S5791}BINGAMANMr. BINGAMAN. I do agree. The program currently seems to be on scheduleand well managed. All in all, MIMIC is progressing well toward its objectives,and the reduction that was applied to this program was without prejudice.[S13MY8-1314]{S5791}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. Mr. Chairman, I understand the House has increased the fundingfor MIMIC by $20 million. It would be my hope that in conference we wouldbe able to at least restore the level of funding to the MIMIC Program thatwas requested and, if possible, recede to the House position. What areyour thoughts on this?[S13MY8-1315]{S5791}BINGAMANMr. BINGAMAN. Senator, as I have mentioned, I am a supporter of the MIMICtechnology, and will attempt to provide a higher level of funding thanthat provided in the Senate bill when we negotiate with the House conferees.[S13MY8-1316]{S5791}HUMPHREYMr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Senator.[S13MY8-1317]{S5791}ADAMSMr. ADAMS. Mr. President, as the chairman knows, my home State of Washingtonwill be hosting the Goodwill games in 1990. This event will be the largestinternational sporting event held between Olympiads. Current plans indicatethat 22 nations will be represented. Unlike those held in 1986, these gamesare under the direction of a nonprofit corporation which is controlledby business and community leaders in the Seattle-Tacoma area.Seattle-Tacoma and the entire State of Washington are committed to makingthese games a successful event. There are already a number of culturalevents planned to compliment the athletic competition and help the gamesachieve their stated purpose of increasing understanding between the nationsand people involved. The community has already made a substantial contributionto defray the cost of the competition and associated events_and it is preparedto do more.However, as the chairman knows, the security risks associated with an eventlike this are substantial. The city and the State just do not have thecapacity to provide the sophisticated equipment and support that is necessaryto provide the sort of security needed in an era of international terrorism.In the past, the Congress has directed the Department of Defense to provideassistance for nonpersonnel support drawing on DOD's expertise and equipment.The House authorization bill includes such an authorization for the Goodwillgames. The chairman and I have discussed the possibility of including suchan authorization in the Senate bill and I wonder if he would comment onhis thinking on this issue?[S13MY8-1318]{S5791}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington and I have discussedthis issue. As he knows, the Armed Services Committee has indicated a stroingconcern about such funding requests in the past. In fact, the committeehad indicated that we would not consider such requests in a era of strainedbudgets and tight resources. The position taken by the committee, however,did not become a part of the law. As a result, it is entirely possiblethat communities involved in such events might have been unaware of theconstraints we wished to impose. In addition, I am aware that the Househas included an authorization designed to support security needs at theGoodwill games. With other States seeking to host international competitionsof this sort, I assume that there will be future requests for funding ofthis kind.As I have indicated to my colleague from Washington, there was not timeto consider the policy implications of this request when the committeewas marking up this bill. If an amendment was offered to authorize securityassistance funds for the Goodwill games, the committee would_based on itsprevious position_be obliged to oppose it. I honestly think that the bestcourse of action is to allow us to take this issue to conference and discussit with the House without the full Senate having taken a position on it.That will give the committee an opportunity to try to establish a policyfor the future while protecting the Senator's immediate interests.[S13MY8-1319]{S5792}ADAMSMr. ADAMS. I thank the chairman. Let me indicate again that I believe theGoodwill games are an extremely valuable tool in the ongoing process ofbuilding understanding and peaceful competition between the United States,the Soviet Union and other nations throughout the world. Given the rolethat these games can play, I believe that support from the Department ofDefense is appropriate; given the fact that the goals of the games havenot yet been achieved, such support is essential. I would simply indicatethat I trust the chairman's ability to resolve this issue in a way whichwill allow the games to have the security support they need. Again, I appreciatethe comments of the chairman and I look forward to working with him asthis issue moves through the conference.[S13MY8-1320]{S5792}CHILESMr. CHILES. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to engagethe distinguished manager of the bill, and chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee, Senator <T4>Nunn,</T4> in a colloquy regarding the transfer of authorizations provisionsof this bill. It is my understanding that the bill contains, as past DOD authorizationsbill have, language that bestows upon the Secretary of Defense the authorityto transfer certain authorization authority between the various titlesof the bill. Of particular interest is section 902 of the bill. I understandthat this section increases the authorization transfer authority givento the Secretary for fiscal year 1988 by some $2 billion. If the purpose of this provision is to ensure that the Secretary has adequateauthorization levels for anticipated further appropriation action thisfiscal year then I have no problem with the language. However, as chairmanof the Senate Budget Committee, I want to ensure that the effect of theproposed additional fiscal year 1988 authority given to the Secretary inno way allows the Secretary to obligate funds in excess of the amountspreviously appropriated to the Department of Defense, absent further appropriationsaction. Is that the Senator from Georgia's understanding?[S13MY8-1321]{S5792}NUNNMr. NUNN. The Senator from Florida is correct.[S13MY8-1322]{S5792}CHILESMr. CHILES. I thank the Senator for his clarification.[S13MY8-1323]{S5792}fort lewis<ITAG tagnum="89">fort lewis elementary education center, clover park school district</ITAG>[S13MY8-1324]{S5792}EVANSMr. EVANS. Mr. President, I am prepared to offer an amendment authorizing$10 million for the construction of a special needs and education centerat Fort Lewis, WA. This facility would service the McChord Air Force Base/FortLewis community which has a disproportionately large population of specialneeds children compared to other military communities around the country.The Army recently designated Fort Lewis as a compassionate assignment forparents of handicapped children, and in so doing placed a tremendous burdenon Clover Park School District. Officials are now required to find additionalspace to meet the special education needs of its student population.[S13MY8-1325]{S5792}NUNNMr. NUNN. I concur with the Senator from Washington's [Mr. <T4>Evans</T4>] remarks. At this time, unfortunately, we do not have a$10 million offset for the project. I would appreciate the Senator withdrawinghis amendment so as to enable us to preserve enough flexibility to addressthis issue adequately in conference. Ultimately, I believe there is a goodchance that we will be able to work with our House colleagues to securefunding for this most important project.[S13MY8-1326]{S5792}EVANSMr. EVANS. While we can appreciate the budgetary constraints with whichwe all are faced in this current fiscal year, we hope the distinguishedSenator from Georgia [Mr. <T4>Nunn</T4>] will urge the Senate conferees to recede to the House provisionin conference. I, therefore, withdraw the amendment.[S13MY8-1327]{S5792}ADAMSMr. ADAMS. I, too, concur with the remarks of my colleague, Senator <T4>Evans</T4>. Additionally, I am encouraged by the comments of the distinguishedSenator from Georgia [Mr. <T4>Nunn</T4>]. The importance of, and need for this project cannot beoverstated. The situation in Clover Park is a travesty. The existing facilitiesare inadequate and military special needs children are transported dailyto multiple civilian schools of varying distances from Fort Lewis. Manyof these children must be transported over 20 miles each day. It seemsunreasonable and reprehensible to station a family in a particular areaspecifically for a child to receive attention, and then undermine thateffort by transporting this child great distances so that he or she canreceive proper care and attention. I know the distinguished Senator fromGeorgia [Mr. <T4>Nunn</T4>] will do all he can to see that funding for this most importantproject is authorized in the current fiscal year.[S13MY8-1328]{S5792}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>Would the manager of the bill yield for a questionto clarify certain language in the report?[S13MY8-1329]{S5792}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield to the distinguished senior Senatorfrom Arizona.[S13MY8-1330]{S5792}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>First, let me congratulate the committee on its actionconcerning the AH 64 ``Apache'' helicopter. I note that the bill beforeus authorizes the procurement of 72 Apaches in fiscal year 1989, but recognizesthat the budget request is insufficient to procure that number of helicopters.As a result, the committee added $40 million to assure that 72 aircraftcan be obtained. Further, the committee wisely indicated its support fora multiyear procurement of 72 AH 64's per year for 3 years beginning infiscal year 1990 providing certain conditions are met. To facilitate thismultiyear program, another $40 million was added to procure long leadtimeitems necessary to achieve anticipated savings.On page 21 of the report the last sentence of the AH 64 portion reads asfollows:[S13MY8-1331]{S5792}<ITAG tagnum="21">Those funds may not be obligated, however, if the Department of theArmy fails to successfully negotiate a multiyear contract that conformsto the conditions outlined above, and may not be obligated for helicoptersthat exceed the price of helicopters negotiated under the multiyear contract.</ITAG>Would the distinguished manager of the bill clarify the intent of thatlanguage in order that there may be no question as to its meaning?[S13MY8-1332]{S5792}LEVINMr. LEVIN. I would be happy to. First, let me say that the AH 64 programis a high priority item with the Armed Services Committee. It is an outstandingweapons system in its 7th year of production. Now that it has been in productionfor some time, the committee believes it would be appropriate for the Armyto enter into multiyear contract negotiations to achieve the lowest costat the best economic rate.As to your specific inquiry, the last sentence establishes two conditionsthat must be met before certain funds may be obligated. The first restrictionapplies only to the additional $40 million in advance procurement funds.That restriction precludes their use if a multiyear contract cannot benegotiated which meets the conditions stated in the same section of thereport.The second restriction applies to the $40 million added for the 1989 procurement.That restriction requires that the negotiated unit price of the 1989 helicoptersnot exceed the <ITAG tagnum="80">price obtained under the multiyear contract, all calculated in FY88dollars and adjusted for quantity variations.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1333]{S5792}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI</T4>. I thank the distinguished Senator for the explanation.One final point for clarification: The unit prices under the multiyearcontract reflect savings from economic purchases of materials and supportequipment that would not be achievable under single year fiscal year 1989program buy. Those savings could be as much as 40 percent of the totalmultiyear savings.It is the committee's intent that the 1989 procurement in fact be a partof the multiyear contract so that the same unit costs are achieved_or_thatthe 1989 single year procurement be negotiated separately, but concurrentlywith the multiyear contract to achieve as much of the multiyear savingsas possible except for the economic ordering savings? This letter interpretationwould make achieving the prescribed unit price of 90 percent of the averageunit cost for the 1984-87 program very difficult. Does the committee viewthis 90 percent as an absolute requirement or an achievable goal?[S13MY8-1334]{S5793}LEVINMr. LEVIN. The Senator identified two alternatives, and either is acceptable.The Army can include the fiscal year 1989 units in a combined multiyearcontract, or it can negotiate the 1989 program concurrently with a multiyearcontract. In either instance, the unit cost for the aircraft procured withfiscal year 1989 dollars cannot exceed the unit cost negotiated under themultiyear contract, and in both instances the savings must be at least10 percent compared to annual contracts.I thank the Senator for bringing this matter up for clarification.[S13MY8-1335]{S5793}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>I thank the distinguished manager of the bill for hishelpful response.[S13MY8-1336]{S5793}ADAMSMr. ADAMS. Mr. President, my colleagues from Washington, Senator <T4>Evans, </T4>and I have held extensive discussions with Senator <T4>Dixon, </T4>the chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, Sustainability,and Support, and Senator <T4>Nunn, </T4>the chairman of the full committee, about the proposal tozero out funding in fiscal year 1989 for the Everett homeport. We firmlybelieve that this decision represents neither sound strategy nor an appropriateresponse to the ongoing litigation surrounding the Everett homeport. Ithas become clear, however, that the committee is committed to taking thisposition to conference. As I understand it, while the committee prefersnot to see this issue debated on the floor, they have indicated that theirposition is not set in concrete and that there will be a full and open-mindeddiscussion with the House, which has partially funded the administration'srequest for Everett, when this bill goes to conference. I would ask thechairman if that understanding is correct?[S13MY8-1337]{S5793}NUNNMr. NUNN. I fully understand the Senator's concern and he and I have discussedit several times in the past with both Senators from Washington. As weall know, there have been heated debates about the wisdom of strategichomeporting in the past. We did not revisit that debate this year. In termsof our deliberations on this bill, we accepted the Navy's original rationalefor the homeporting program. However, in the case of Everett, and, to someextent, San Francisco, we found an unusual <ITAG tagnum="80">situation: the Everett homeport has received an authorization of almost$100 million in the past, but the Navy has been unable to spend most ofthis sum due to pending litigation. As I understand it, the only substantialwork accomplished since the first increment of funding in fiscal year 1986has been demolition of an industrial facility and some land aquisition.Given the tight budget constraints under which we are operating, we concludedthat, given the existing unspent funds, the $53 million request for fiscalyear 1989 was simply not justified. I want to make it clear that we deniedfunding without prejudice; our decision did not get to the merits of theprogram, just to the problems created by litigation and tight resources.However, we are mindful that the Navy has already scaled back the sizeof its fleet and will likely have to make further force reductions in itsnext 5-year plan. This data will not be available until early next year.The Navy has made it clear that it wants the Everett project to continue.By the time we go to conference, it is possible that the litigation maybe resolved and that the Navy will be able to develop a coherent plan toexpend prior year and fiscal year 1989 funds. We anticipate a full discussionof this issue with our colleagues in the House and we are willing to giveany proposals they make a full and fair hearing. </ITAG>[S13MY8-1338]{S5793}EVANSMr. EVANS. I would like to make it clear for the record that, because ofconcerted efforts by officials from State and local government agenciesand the Navy, substantial progress has been made in laying a strong foundationfor this project. With the exception of the final disposition of the dredgepermit issue, all conditions precedent to actual construction have beenmet. I understand the final hurdle is expected to be cleared in the verynear future, probably prior to conference with the House. I want to stress that both Senator <T4>Adams </T4>and I have been working to ensure that the Everett projectreceives the funds necessary to move forward as soon as all necessary conditionshave been met. We will continue to work closely with the committee to keepthem apprised of all relevant legal developments so that the discussionin conference will be based on the best available information. [S13MY8-1339]{S5793}DIXONMr. DIXON. Let me add just a brief comment: I do have doubts about thehomeporting program. I have expressed those in the past. But in this case,I completely agree that our deliberations were narrowly focused on theunique combination of events operating at Everett. I also agree with thechairman: we fully expect to have a complete discussion of this issue withthe House when we go to conference and, if the legal situation has changedby that time, that would clearly have an impact on those discussions. Ihave had a number of conversations with both Senator <T4>Adams </T4>and Senator <T4>Evans </T4>on this issue and I understand how deeply they are committedto moving this project forward. I believe that the Senators from Washingtonalso understand that I have promised to give their views every considerationwhen we go to conference. [S13MY8-1340]{S5793}ADAMSMr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues. Senator<T4>Evans </T4>and I had considered offering an amendment to restore fundingfor Everett. However, based on the commitment to discuss this issue inconference, based on the firm support in the House for this program, andbased on the high priority that the Navy places on Everett, we do not believethat offering an amendment would be the best course of action to take.The committee would be compelled to oppose it and the debate would producea polarization in positions. Given the comments made by Senator <T4>Dixon </T4>and Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>, I believe that quiet conversations and meaningful negotiationsin the conference are the best way to resolve this issue.

Mr. President, I would like to clarify the committee'sview on a provision in the House of Representatives version of the fiscalyear 1989 Department of Defense authorization bill. This provision wasoffered as an amendment by Congressman <T4>Smith</T4> of New Jersey. It authorizes the Secretary of the Navy toprovide up to $1.5 million to assist the Tinton Falls School District inTinton Falls, NJ, to support the education of dependents of personnel stationedat Earle Naval Weapons Station during the 1989-90 school year. This provisionis not included in the Senate's bill, and I hope that the distinguishedchairman can make clear the committee's position on this issue.[S13MY8-1343]{S5793}NUNNMr. NUNN. I will be glad to discuss this issue with the Senator from NewJersey.[S13MY8-1344]{S5793}LAUTENBERGMr. LAUTENBERG. It is my understanding that the Senate Armed Forces Committeebelieves this provision would provide the Department of Defense with thesame authority already granted under section 2016 of the recently enactedSchool Improvement Act. Section 2016 specifically addresses the questionof financial assistance for the education of children for whom a localeducation agency is unable to provide an education. This section amendsPublic Law 81-874 to allow school districts who receive payments from theDepartment of Education due to the presence of children whose parents liveor work on Federal property to also receive financial assistance underthe Department of Defense schools program.Mr. President, a brief background is important for my colleagues to understandthe need for this discussion. Earle Naval Weapons Station is located inseveral municipalities in New Jersey, including the borough of Tinton Fallsand the township of Colts Neck. For 2 years, Senator <T4>Bradley</T4> and I have been working with the Navy and local officialsto address the Navy's urgent need for housing for approximately 1,160 additionalmilitary and civilian personnel who will be stationed at Earle as a resultof the homeporting of two auxiliary oil and explosives ships [AOE's]. TheNavy is currently in the process of constructing 500 additional units ofhousing for these families. Approximately 400 school-age children are expectedto attend local schools in Monmouth County, NJ. The addition of these childrenwill have a tremendous impact on the local school district responsiblefor the education of these children.Under prior State law, all schoolchildren residing on Earle were requiredto attend school in the Colts Neck School District in Colts Neck Township.However, arrangements were made between the Navy and the neighboring boroughof Tinton Falls, with the support of the New Jersey Department of Educationfor children to attend school in Tinton Falls. This arrangement was recentlyfacilitated through the the enactment by New Jersey of Public Law 88, chapter15. This law sets up a procedure under which a school district whose propertyis included within a military installation may be designated as the districtto provide for the education of all the children residing on that installation.Beginning in the fall of 1989, and over the next several years, there areexpected to be as many as 407 children attending school in Tinton Falls.[S13MY8-1345]{S5794}BRADLEYMr. BRADLEY.

Mr. President, on March 1 of this year, the moratorium on furtheractions by the Federal banking regulators on bank asset powers issues expired.The very next day, March 2, the Senate Banking Committee voted to reportS. 1886, the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act of 1988, to the Senatefloor by an 18 to 2 margin. By the end of the month, March 30 to be exact,the full Senate endorsed the committee's action, passing the bill by anoverwhelming 94 to 2 vote with virtually no amendments.The Senate has therefore kept its part of the promise the Congress madelast year during debate on S. 790 and H.R. 27, which ultimately becamelaw as the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987. That bill did notaddress fundamental banking law reform issues, but section 203(a) statedthat ``it is the intent of the Congress, through the Committee on Banking,Housing and Urban Affairs of the U.S. Senate and the Committee on Banking,Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives to conduct acomprehensive review of our banking and financial laws and to make decisionson the need for financial restructuring legislation in the light of today'schanging financial environment both domestic and international before theexpiration of such moratorium.''While the Senate was not able to complete action on its financial restructuringbill before March 1, it did so soon therefter. I urge my colleagues inthe House of Representatives to join the Senate and to complete actionon their part of the pledge made August. I hope the House Banking Committeeand the House Energy and Commerce Committee can soon complete action onthe kind of banking law reform package that is so badly needed.I confess to some disappointment, Mr. President, that neither one of thetwo House Committees have yet acted. This is an election year. Time isalready beginning to run out. I know that join referral necessarily makesthe committee process lengthier, but that makes it even more alarming thatthe committee process is not yet very far along.I think the Senate bill is a good one. It did not pass 94 to 2 by accident.It is based on 83 days of hearings, 457 witnesses, and over 18,000 pagesof transcript. It is well thought out, which is the reason it passed bysuch a strong margin.There are those who assert that the Senate did not really know what itwas doing, and who believe that the fact that the Senate bill was reportedafter two intensive days of closed door negotiations represents some sortof fatal flaws. I can only say in response that the Senate bill was hammeredout over many months and that virtually every member of the Banking Committeewas involved in that effort. The last 2 days of negotiations involved veryimportant provisions of the bill, but it is important to remember thatmost of the bill's important <ITAG tagnum="80">provisions, were already almost completely agreed to. Even the insuranceprovisions, which took the majority of the last 2 days, did not involvea new, last-minute suggestion. The basis for the insurance compromise wasan amendment considered by the Senate in 1984.</ITAG>The simple fact is that the members of the Banking Committee and the Senateat large are convinced of the merit of the Senate approach. The Senatestrongly believes that it is long past time to enact real, meaningful,structural reform.It is Congress, not the regulators or the courts, that should control thereform process. Having said that, however, I also want to point out thatthe Senate recognizes that the regulators and the courts have been actingbecause Congress has not acted. They have stepped into the vaccum causedby our own lack of progress.Further, it is important to remember that the regulators and the courtsare not trying to change the law. Rather, they are playing a catch-up game_tryingto keep our regulatory system somewhat relevant to the changed economicsituation in our financial markets.It seems to me, therefore, that we have a simple choice: Either enact reformlegislation along the lines of the Senate bill that really does begin toaddress the underlying factors that create the demand for reform, or continueto leave the issues to the regulators and the courts to address as bestthey can.I do not want to leave the issues to the regulators and courts, but I amalso convinced that the Senate will not enact legislation that puts Congressin the place of King Canute_trying to hold back the tide. That cannot bedone, and we should not even try.I earnestly hope the House will pass a good, solid reform bill. Actionalong these lines by the House will help guarantee a relatively easy House-Senateconference, and help ensure timely enactment of legislation this year.I hope and believe that my colleagues in the House will not send us thekind of narrow bill that does not address the real reform issues. I amsure they know that such a narrow bill would be a recipe for an impasse.I am confident that the House does not want to throw away the opporunityto enact meaningful legislation this year. I know, Mr. President, that there are those that would like to derail theProxmire Financial Modernization Act of 1988 in the hope of getting eithera much narrower bill or a renewal of the moratorium. To them, I have asimple reply: it will not happen. Section 203(b) of the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 makes that point clear. It states: ``it is the intentof the Congress not to renew or extend the moratorium established undersection 201 whether or not subsequent banking legislation is passed bythe Congress.'' Let me repeat that for my colleagues. The moratorium willnot be renewed even if there is no further action on banking legislationin this Congress. This is one Senator, Mr. President, that intends to do everything he canto see that we live up to that pledge. I believe a strong majority in theSenate supports that pledge and that there is no chance that the moratoriumwill be extended, even if we cannot reach agreement with the House on areform bill along the lines of the Senate-passed bill. In conclusion, I want to urge my colleagues in the House to act quicklyso that we can begin the conference process. Time is already starting torun short in this Congress, and it is important to ensure that the confereeshave the time they need to arrive at a good bill that will command solidsupport in both the House and the Senate. A conference agreement is byno means assured at this point; the chances of achieving one get more difficultas we run out of time.[S13MY8-1358]{S5795}banking le<ITAG tagnum="89">banking legislation in the house of representatives</ITAG>[S13MY8-1359]{S5795}GARNMr. GARN. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in urgingthe House of Representatives to delay no further in passing legislationthat would fundamentally reform the financial laws of this country.On March 30, 1988, this body passed the sorely needed <T4>Proxmire </T4>Financial Modernization Act of 1988 by the overwhelmingvote of 94-2. This followed a similarly lopsided 18-2 vote in the BankingCommittee to pass virtually the same legislation. Such a consensus wasthe product of a very delicate compromise that was hammered out at thecommittee markup after months of wrangling over intensely controversialissues. My colleagues and I, after years of sometimes acrimonious debateand tens of thousands of pages of testimony, finally said enough is enough:Congress needs to reassert its control over changes in the regulatory structureof financial institutions because the market is already rapidly changingthe financial system.Unfortunately, despite the Senate's virtually unanimous reform proposal,we find ourselves in a familiar state of frustration and paralysis: TheSenate has passed sweeping banking legislation, but the House of Representativesis sitting on its hands. I am sorry to say that I am only too familiarwith this situation. In 1984, when I was chairman of the Banking Committee,we passed a similar piece of legislation that the House simply refusedto consider. In 1986 the House made it perfectly clear that it would notaccept a comprehensive banking bill, and at the end of that Congress itkilled the Senate's $15 billion package to recapitalize the ailing Federalsavings and loan insurance corporation by trying to attach a controversialhousing bill.Now they are at it again. First, the Senate bill was referred jointly,without any time limitations, to both House Banking and House Energy andCommerce. That will obviously slow things down, and once again, I am veryfamiliar with the tactic. In both 1984 and 1986 I received letters fromHouse Energy and Commerce asserting its intention to take jurisdictionover certain banking issues with the consent of House Banking in both casesthat effectively killed Senate legislation because of the time it wouldtake to move a comprehensive bill through two committees. Furthermore, although both committees have held a series of hearings onfinancial restructuring legislation, that is as far as they have gotten.Six weeks have passed since the Senate passed its bill, but the House BankingCommittee has not yet scheduled a markup and evidently is not planningto any time soon. House Energy and Commerce has also failed to schedulea markup.Meanwhile, the legislative clock for this Congress is steadily tickingaway. There is still time to pass meaningful banking legislation, but thelonger we wait, the slimmer those prospects become. I realize there arethose who believe that the closer we get to the end of this Congress, themore likely it is that a much more narrow or restrictive bill will pass.<ITAG tagnum="80">Some have even suggested that Congress is likely to reinstate theanticompetitive and irresponsible moratorium on bank activities that Congressimposed 7 months ago as part of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of1987.</ITAG>Let me respond directly to these suggestions: We will not let them happen.No bill at all is a far better result than anticompetitive, restrictivelegislation that hamstrings this country's financial services providers.Most of my colleagues and I would much prefer to leave in place the present``system'' of creative regulatory interpretations of outmoded laws thanpass something regressive. Furthermore, any type of moratorium extensionis as out of the question now as it was 10 months ago when a substantialmajority of this body had gone on record refusing to take such an action.My colleagues and I will do everything we can to stop these efforts. Mr. President, we have sent a very good bill to the House. No one was completelyhappy with it, but nearly everyone could at least live with it, and thatis the sign of a good compromise. The bill is supported by the administration,the Federal Reserve and the other bank regulators, the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the banks, the insurance industry and agents, and as a substantialfirst step in financial reform, by several of the diversified financialcompanies. The real estate industry was not happy that their issues werenot addressed, but my understanding is that they and the bankers are closeto working out a compromise of their differences. With all of this support, and with the overwhelming vote of the Senate,now is the time for Congress to act. Final resolution of these structuralissues is needed this year to enable the banking committees to focus nextyear on other critical issues_like the FSLIC_that also demand our attention.I refuse to believe that the House will simply derail this critically importantlegislation, and I urge that body to act soon. Let me close with a sobering thought. The American financial services industryis coming under increasing pressure from overseas competitors, particularlythe Japanese. Ranked by market capitalization, 13 of the 15 largest financialfirms in the world, including banks and securities firms, are Japanese.None are American. At the same time, every industrial country in the world except the UnitedStates, permits commercial banks or their affiliates to underwrite securities,as the Senate bill would do. Even the Japanese permit a far greater degreeof affiliation between the securities and banking industries than is popularlyperceived, and they are poised to take much greater steps in that direction.As the national journal stated earlier this year, ``Japan's newly deregulated,cash-rich banks have the potential to dominate world markets much as Japaneseautomakers have.'' We in the Congress have a duty to unshackle U.S. competitorsin the largest financial market in the world, our own country, as at leaston effort to prevent such domination from taking place. That is an even more important reason why we can't sit idly by and do nothingabout banking reform legislation. [S13MY8-1360]{S5796}prognosis <ITAG tagnum="89">prognosis for a banking bill in 1988</ITAG>[S13MY8-1361]{S5796}GRAHAMMr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we face a tremendous challenge today in thebanking industry. Our financial systems are based on old monetary realitieswhich no longer adequately cope with a new world of rapidly expanding economies,instant communications, and overnight changes.It is time we brought the American financial world into the eighties. It'stime we reassert ourselves as world financial leaders and recapture themomentum in our domestic market.The forces driving the industry are:Market competition to increase profits or dividends to stockholders, andMarket competition to increase interest rate charges to customers.The field has been complicated by the aggressive entrepreneurship whichblurs the old lines that used to separate financial institutions.In some States, such as my State of Florida, nonbank banks have targetedprofitable markets and threatened traditional banking's dominance of someparts of the money business.The new phenomenon of ``securitization'' has altered the way we deal withbusiness capitalization. International competition for the U.S. markethas intensified.If we do nothing, all those driving forces may lead us to an unhealthydomestic uncertainty and a dangerous hesitance to make long-term commitmentsand decisions.Meanwhile, foreign competition from European and Japanese finance institutionsis a growing influence and presence in the United States domestic market.The end result could be a replication of what has happened in other significantareas of the American economy_a declining share of our own domestic market.The Senate has moved to manage the future of our financial system by passinga restructuring bill by a vote of 94 to 2. All eyes now turn toward theHouse Banking and Energy and Commerce Committees.It is my hope these committees will take action in the near future on arestructuring bill. Consumers, homebuilders, State and local governments_allthe users of the financial system_are looking to Congress for responsible,national financial leadership.If we address these important financial regulatory issues promptly we willnot hand over our mandate for future-oriented fiscal policy to the courtsor to the regulators.We need to move our financial system into the 21st century_and the bestway to do that is to bring it up to date with the marketplace.[S13MY8-1362]{S5796}bank dereg<ITAG tagnum="89">bank deregulation, a misnomer</ITAG>[S13MY8-1363]{S5796}BONDMr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my Senate Banking Committee colleaguesin urging the House to move forward with companion legislation to S. 1886,the Proxmire Financial Modernization Act.If the House fails to act on a banking bill this year, the courts and thebank regulators will be free to act and substantial changes in our financiallaws are likely without congressional approval. These are serious publicpolicy issues which should be debated and resolved by elected public officials.The buck should not be passed to the other branches of Government.Our banking laws were designed to protect the safety and soundness of acompartmentalized financial system with several discrete types of institutions.As these distinctions are eroded by changes in the world economy and communicationstechnology, it has now become necessary for Congress to restructure ourbanking laws to reflect new realities. The New York Times has editorialized:[S13MY8-1364]{S5796}<ITAG tagnum="21">The real choice in the long run, then, is between piecemeal bank deregulationby the States and uniform national reforms buttressed by increased regulatoryscrutiny. Sooner or later_preferably sooner_a majority in Congress willunderstand that this is no choice at all and pass something like the Proxmireplan.</ITAG>The Senate has taken this advice and passed S. 1886 which sets up thismuch needed new framework. The legislation, which was approved by a 94-to-2vote, allows banks to get into the securities business in an orderly, step-by-stepprocess. The bill ensures that companies offering the same services allhave to play by the same rules and have to meet the same safety and soundnessrequirements. The safeguards in the Senate bill were the product of longand careful deliberations and those who argue that the Senate bill doesnot have enough ``firewalls'' are not looking carefully enough.I encourage House Members to use the Senate bill as the framework for theirdeliberations. The Senate bill is not perfect of course, but if the Housebill is dramatically different from S. 1886, there will not be enough timeto resolve the issues in conference and there will be no bill. This impassewould then give the regulators the green light to deregulate as they seefit. That is a result that no one wants to see.It is not correct to say that this debate is about giving banks new powers.It is about structure and regulation. Bank deregulation is a misnomer.The real task for Congress is to set up a sensible regulatory scheme forthe financial services industry that reflects the changes in the worldeconomy. Repealing Glass-Steagall and setting new rules for bank securitiesactivities is a good first step. The House should get on with it.[S13MY8-1365]{S5797}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1366]{S5797}BICENTENNI<ITAG tagnum="81">BICENTENNIAL MINUTE</ITAG>[S13MY8-1367]{S5797}may 15, 18<ITAG tagnum="89">may 15, 1871: the senate investigates newspaper reporters</ITAG>[S13MY8-1368]{S5797}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, 117 years ago this week, on May 15, 1871, a Senateselect committee began an investigation into the unauthorized publicationin the New York Tribune of the treaty of Washington, which settled relationsbetween the United States and Great Britain that had been disrupted duringthe Civil War.Today the Senate conducts most treaty debates in open session, but backin the late 19th century, treaty debates were generally held in secret_orat least they were intended to be secret. Washington newspaper correspondentsrather quickly learned most of what went on inside these secret sessionsand published the secret debates and votes in their papers. Periodically,some outraged Senator would demand an investigation, and a select committeewould be appointed to uncover the sources of the leak. But these sourcesinvariably remained more secret than the original secret debates.In 1871 the select committee called Tribune correspondents Zebulon Whiteand Hiram Ramsdell to answer questions about where they had gotten thetreaty. Neither journalist, however, would break his silence, and so thecommittee ordered them held captive in the Pacific Railroad Committee roomuntil they relented. This tactic proved futile, The two correspondentsentertained guests, dined in the Senate restaurant, and otherwise livedthe lives of comfortable martyrs, showing no signs of relenting. Havingdiscovered not a clue as to who leaked the treaty, the Senate finally releasedthe two men. Although not the first such occasion, this marked the lasttime that the Senate attempted to hold newspaper reporters prisoners inthe Capitol Building.[S13MY8-1369]{S5797}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1370]{S5797}ERIC'S BIR<ITAG tagnum="81">ERIC'S BIRTHDAY</ITAG>[S13MY8-1371]{S5797}GRAHAMMr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Eric Abovich turned 8 today, he got a scooterand some new sneakers and a party with his friends. But the one thing Ericwanted most he won't get this year_a birthday hug from his grandpa.Eric's grandpa is Pyatras Pakenas, a refusenik who lives alone in Vilnius,Lithuania, because the Soviet government will not issue him an exit visa.Eric has never seen his grandfather. Pakenas' wife, daughter, son and son-in-lawall left Russia in 1979, certain he would be allowed to follow in severalmonths. For 8 years they have hoped and prayed and worked to get him out.For 8 years the Soviets have denied Pakenas, a lawyer by profession, permissionto leave. After he applied to emigrate from the Soviet Union, Pakenas losthis law practice and now he works in a meat packing plant.As soon as Eric learned to print he sent a letter to the White House thatbegins:``Mrs. and Mr. Reagan, I am six. I never saw my grandpa. Please help meto see him * * *''Eric talks to his grandfather on the phone about the dog they plan to pickout together some day and about how many kinds of fish they will see underwaterwhen they go snorkeling in Florida. Eric's second grade class at NorthPalm Beach Elementary School knows about his grandfather and they eachwrote letters to Secretary Gorbachev to ask for Pakenas' release.The letters are touching_but what will bring Eric his grandfather is whatalways works with the Soviet Union_strong international pressure_in thiscase a high priority discussion of human rights at the May 29 Moscow Summit.A world power whose borders are prison walls for its own people cannotclaim ``glasnost'' or any other term for openness. If we are to meet withthe Soviets on the level ground of mutual interest in nuclear deterrenceand a secure peace, we must first agree on a common definition of humanrights, on a common understanding of integrity and individual freedom.Any attempt at an arms reduction dialog which disregards the predicateof basic human rights will ultimately be choked off by the anguish of therefuseniks in the Soviet Union and of the separated families in this countrywho wait for them. We must insist that human rights be at the top of thediscussion list in Moscow.Pyatras Pakenas' is the last publicized divided spouse case still unresolved.His wife, Dr. Galina Vileshina, a neurologist with a practice in southFlorida, has worked constantly for his release since her departure fromRussia. Hers has been a frustrating and bitter struggle.The case is alternately mired in redtape or ignored. Pakenas, who suffersfrom heart trouble, is shuffled back and forth from the bureaucracy inVilnius to the bureaucracy in Moscow. He gets nothing but refusals or silence.This is a needless tragedy_result of an arrogant and arbitrary policy.Pyatras Pakenas deserves to live with the people who love him. No familyshould be forcibly separated. No little boy should have to ask. ``Why don't they want my grandpa to come visit me?''Eric knows his grandfather as a photograph and a telephone call. All Pakenasknows of the grandson he has never seen are some snapshots and some crayoneddrawings of houses with a car and a dog in the yard_and a small voice onthe telephone saying:``When are you coming here? I want to play with you.''Happy birthday, Eric. Our birthday wish for you is that the grownups finallyrealize what is important and that you get that hug from your grandfatheras a not very belated birthday present.[S13MY8-1372]{S5797}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1373]{S5797}THE LATE D<ITAG tagnum="81">THE LATE DR. FREDERICK DOUGLAS PATTERSON FOUNDER OF THE UNITED NEGROCOLLEGE FUND</ITAG>[S13MY8-1374]{S5797}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a toweringgiant and pioneer in developing quality educational opportunities for youngblack men and women in America_the late Dr. Frederick Douglas Patterson.About 45 years ago, while serving as president of what was then calledTuskegee Institute, Dr. Patterson had a dream that by forming a consortiumof predominantly black colleges and universities here in the United States,he could help develop greater opportunities and higher levels of education,leadership and talent. He made that dream come true by establishing theUnited Negro College Fund. Today, there are approximately 43,000 students enrolled in the 42 UNCFmember colleges and universities. About 5,000 of these students are enrolledin the 5 UNCF members in my home State of Alabama. Dr. Patterson was president of Tuskegee Institute from 1933 to 1953. Hejoined the Phelps-Stokes Fund as director in 1953, became president in1958, president emeritus in 1970, and consultant on educational affairsin 1970. From 1969 to 1973, he was president of the Robert R. Motion MemorialInstitute, became chairman in 1973, and was serving as Chairman Emerituswhen he died April 26, 1988.In 1984, I had the distinct honor and privilege of presenting to him ata UNCF dinner in Alabama the ``Exemplary Leadership Award.'' In 1987, PresidentReagan bestowed to him the Medal of Freedom_The Nation's highest civilianaward. Dr. Patterson's many other awards, honors, achievements, board memberships,and publications are too numerous to mention at this time. However, I wouldlike to acknowledge the fact that because of Dr. Patterson's dream some45 years ago to establish the United Negro College Fund, he helped Americato realize that, ``A mind is a terrible thing to waste.''In closing, I would like to announce that a special memorial service willbe held for Dr. Patterson June 10, 1988, at the Abyssinian Baptist Churchin New York City. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Patterson's obituary,which appeared in the Washington Post on April 28, 1988, be reprinted infull in the <T4>Record</T4> at this time.

Simpson) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nancy Reagan always seems to get a bum rap in the ``tattle-tale''book business. She deserves a hell of a lot better. For when we electedher remarkable husband to this job of president, she was_surely is_``partof the deal.'' She took on a tough job that has no definitions but manydemands. She has fulfilled her obligations and duties to her country andto her husband with great grace, class and distinction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The bottom line of the latest catty little revelation is that sheis protective of her husband, who just happens to be the president. Sheis accused of unquestioned devotion and loyalty to Ronald Reagan. Egad,what will people think? It reminds me of, and strengthens the sagenessof, the old saw that ``If you want to have a friend in Washington, buya dog.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But the issue is not now ``Don Regan's book.'' It is apparently NancyReagan's activities. How ironic to see two fine men whom I have known_LarrySpeakes and Don Regan_bring themselves down to a lesser level by spewingout these rather vengeful portrayals. Their luster leaves their personalitiesas the bluster leaves their pens. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Can we all remember well the early days of the Reagan presidency?In just a few short months, Nancy Reagan came under heavy fire for being``uninvolved'' in the vital issues of the day. ``She doesn't take advantageof her unique position,'' the naysayers moaned and knurled their knuckles.Now she is being portrayed as some sort of flaky, all-powerful oracle.What guff. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I think one of the things that spooks people about Ron and Nancy Reaganis that they have a great thing going. It is called a love affairs_andit has spanned 36 years and counting. They hold hands, they smooch, theyshare their lives and experiences, they wholly support each other, theylaugh, they giggle,and all that pretty much threatens people who don'tunderstand it or who don't live it. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All the chatter around the water cooler about Nancy Reagan is a distractionfrom the person who is really at the center of the controversy, Don Regan.Let's put his departure from the White House in full perspective and getthings back in focus. Nancy Reagan didn't drive Don Reagan out. There werea lot of people lined up in the batter's box to do just that. Many weekspassed between the time the Iran-contra story became page-one news andDonald Regan's hurried and harried departure from the White House. Duringthose weeks I was honored to participate in any number of meetings withthe president where he was counseled_and, yes even directed_to dismisshis chief of staff. The congressional press crew and galleries worked overtimein those days to accommodate the calls for Regan's resignation and to providethe long knives to lop off his head.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In that time period, I also had several fine conversations with NancyReagan, who was, as always, alert, thoughtful, articulate and protectiveof her husband. We talked about the various views of the situation. Weshared some personal observations. The person I talked to then_and alwayshave_was an informed, loving and concerned wife. She wanted to hear ``allsides.'' She came to her own firm conclusions about her husband's bestinterests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I recall with amusement some observers being ``surprised'' to learnthat Harry Truman had consulted his steady wife, Bess, before decidingto drop the atomic bomb. That revelation couldn't surprise anyone one whitwho had ever seen a good marriage at work. Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter wrotean entire book about the way they tried to handle the rigors and demandsof the presidency as husband and wife. Only a damn fool would suggest thatthe wife of the president of the United States has no role whatever inthe governing of our country. It might not read that way in the civicstexts or statute books, but that's the way it is in the book of real life.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have a very fine staff of more than 25 thoughtful, hard-workingand intelligent folks. They are there to assist me in my tasks and responsibilities.But there is really only one dazzling person in my life who keeps me ``centered''_whohelps me keep it all ``together.'' That person is Ann, my wife of nearly34 years. She is part of my inner gyroscope, adds the balance and leavento my life_in or out of politics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nancy and Ronald Reagan, too, have found their own way to deal withthe political world. They know where to turn when you don't know whereto turn. They have deep reservoirs of faith in a higher being, in themselvesand in others. Politics in itself as a singular pursuit is a rather barbaricquest. You often have to be leavened in life by a spouse and love and artand music and nature and faith and friends and loyalty and trust. The Reaganshave that. They have it with each other. For them, his success is her success.Nancy's accomplishments and strengths are part of the president's triumphsand character too.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this goldfish bowl of Washington (and it's odd how many sharkscan get into a goldfish bowl!) Nancy Reagan has put her own distinctiveand unique trademark on the role of First Lady. She tackled the drug andalcohol abuse issue before it was ever page-one news. In fact, her steadinessand her stature and her tireless efforts to focus on that issue helpedto bring it to the forefront of the American consciousness. ``Just sayno.'' There is no need to snicker or chuckle at that. It's right. She expressesit beautifully, authentically and sincerely. She has traveled more than170,000 miles throughout the United States and in foreign countries aspart of the antidrug and anticontrolled substance campaign. I think allof us are struck by that gentle image of her listening attentively to thestruggle related by a young person fighting to overcome the obsession andhabit of drugs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">How sad that anyone would be titillated by what is really a vengefulportrayal of a beautiful lady. Throughout the remarkable presidency ofRonald Reagan, Nancy Reagan has been right there. She was the one at hisside while they plucked a bullet from his chest or cut a section of colonfrom his body. We have watched her there, ``steady at his side.'' She hasalways been the one to nurture and sustain him. You can bet the lunch moneythat he is right there now serving her in the same moving fashion.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1382]{S5799}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1383]{S5799}SMALL BUSI<ITAG tagnum="81">SMALL BUSINESS WEEK</ITAG>[S13MY8-1384]{S5799}HEFLINMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, today marks the end of the Small Business Week,as proclaimed by President Reagan, in recognition of the 17 million smallbusinesses in this country.It has been a busy week for those involved in the Small Business Week process.In my own home State of Alabama, the Small Business Administration andthe chambers of commerce across the State have celebrated with receptionsfor honorees and special seminars on the small business world.Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.The 17 million small business owners provide for half of the Nation's privateemployment, which is almost 40 percent of national production in this Nation.Small businesses also create about two of every three new jobs in thiscountry. We can attribute 38 percent of our gross national product to smallbusinesses. In my home State of Alabama, there were 61,917 business establishmentsin Alabama in 1986. Of these, 54,199, or 87.5 percent, were small businesseswith fewer than 500 employees, and they employed 47.6 percent of Alabama'swork force.Mr. President, while it is unfortunate that the rate of new business formationhas been declining nationally, I am proud to say that Alabama continuesto have stable new business growth. In Alabama, small business generatedalmost all of the 32,200 new jobs created in Alabama between 1980 and 1984.Mr. President, I believe that women and ethnic minorities have both benefitedgreatly in the past few years through small businesses. The Small BusinessAdministration has special programs geared to assist women and minoritiesin opening businesses.From 1977 to 1984, the number of businesses owned by women increased by11 percent annually in America. I can state with pride that according todata from the Department of Commerce, Alabama had the 30th largest women-ownedbusiness population (33,576) and the 24th largest minority-owned businesspopulation (8,137) in the Nation in 1982.Not only that, Mr. President; minority business ownership in this countryhas also rapidly increased in recent years. Black-owned businesses increased46.7 percent from 1977 to 1982, and Hispanic and Asian-owned businessesalso increased during that time.The Small Business Administration has played an important and vital rolein the success of small businesses in this country. Without assistancefrom the SBA, many small businesses would not be in existence today. TheSBA's Office of Advocacy is specifically mandated by Congress to be anadvocate for America's 18 small businesses.I once heard someone say that small business people are the true adventurersin this country. What a wonderfully accurate statement. For who else butthe small business person starts with a dream, goes into unknown territory,struggles against all odds, takes on extra risks, all the while knowingthat he or she might never see this dream come to fruition? American smallbusiness people have what I call true American pioneer spirit.Mr. President, I want to commend and congratulate all those who have everhad a dream and felt a tug of that pioneer spirit, and then have gone aheadagainst the odds to achieve their dream. I am happy that President Reaganhas dedicated a week to their fine achievements, and I would like to congratulatethem all.I thank you, Mr. President.[S13MY8-1385]{S5799}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1386]{S5799}IS CONGRES<ITAG tagnum="81">IS CONGRESS SUPPORTING ITS TACTICAL AIR FORCES THAT ARE ON THE LINEIN EUROPE?</ITAG>[S13MY8-1387]{S5799}HATCHMr. HATCH. Mr. President, the INF Treaty is on everyone's minds as we discussthe DOD authorization bill. And well it should be, Mr. President, becauseINF's success, in my mind, will depend on the extent to which we can meetan unchanging military tactical and theater conventional and nuclear threatin NATO.In a recent meeting with Senator <T4>Thurmond, </T4>Gen. Bill Kirk, Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Air Forcesin Europe [USAFE] typified our senior military leadership when he saidthat USAFE would do all that was required to comply with the treaty. Myquestion is this: Are we giving General Kirk the support that he needsmeet his mission requirements?Let me tell you something about USAFE, Mr. President, before I proceedto a discussion of my concerns.USAFE's area of operations stretches from the North Sea to the Elbe River,controlling 2,000 aircraft, not to mention the vast array of ordnance onwhich the effectiveness of these aircraft depend, and the logistics trainthat supports USAFE.USAFE's tactical aircraft flew 225,000 hours this last fiscal year, withonly six, that's right Mr. President, only six major mishaps. Yet, as weall know, Europe's weather is not something that any of us generally enjoyflying around in.USAFE's principal aircraft include the F-16C/D models, which will havereplaced all of the Aandamp;B models by October 1988. F-15, F-111 and GLCMround out the major weapon systems, with the GLCM's being phased out bythe INF Treaty.Now, Mr. President, I happen to be among a few members of this body whobelieve that the major U.S. form of participation in NATO should be tacticalair; I would like to see the ground mission requirements absorbed muchmore substantially by our European partners.But whether or not you subscribe to my position calling for expanded tacticalair roles and missions for U.S. forces, you cannot retreat from the compellingneed to support the force currently in place.One such need involves the timely availability of spare parts in orderto fulfill European-based maintenance activities. The Air Force has establishedthe European Distribution System [EDS] for this purpose. It is a forcemultiplier in the sense that readiness and mission availability of thenumbers and types of aircraft for conventional force support is heightened.It is not unlike an experience we have all had, especially if you happento own a foreign car. The garage may not have a part to put your vehicleback on the road, so it gets it from another source. EDS is no differemt.As General Kirk said:[S13MY8-1388]{S5799}.<ITAG tagnum="21">. . . it provides lateral repair/supply support capability betweenoperating bases.</ITAG>How effective is EDS in this role? Again, let me provide for the recordthe remarks of the USAFE CINC, General Kirk:[S13MY8-1389]{S5799}<ITAG tagnum="21">We know EDS works . . . Since 1984, we have experienced a 14 percentincrease in mission capable rates and a 40 percent reduction in aircraftdown-time due to lack of spare parts.</ITAG>Mr. President, over 200 aircraft are provided overseas maintenance throughthe availability of EDS components. What troubles me is, on one hand, thepersistent emphasis in Congress, in both the House and Senate, on our superiortrained pilots, and on the other hand the near-gutting of a program withoutwhich, flying hours, the essence of training superiority, would be dramaticallyand dangerously curtailed, adding to the prospects of battle casualtieson the ground as well as in the air. What makes this matter worse, is thatUSAFE is a forward-deployed, warfighting command. The mission thereforesuffers immediately and directly when readiness, training and aircraftavailability are restricted.  Let me be more precise, Mr. President: This body needs to take a more direct,finite and firm position on this small but important program stating oursupport now so that EDS will not be conveniently axed in the appropriationsprocess.  And axed it will be if the precedents of the past few years apply:  In fiscal years 1986 and 1987 the program was reduced by the appropriationsconference panels in the amounts of $2.5 million and $2.1 million. Thistranslated into a 26-percent annual loss of flying hours_imagine losingthe use of your car for 3 months because the garage couldn't get the part;worse yet, put yourself in the dangerous position of a pilot whose lossof training may make him a premature wartime casualty.  Now I know my initial focus was on Europe, but I have to tell this body,Mr. President, that the situation is even worse in the Pacific Air Forces[PACAF]. Gen. Jack Gregory is no complainer, but he should be. His jurisdictioncovers 35 countries with 2 billion people. His command operates 300 fighterand attack aircraft, in addition to the Military Airlift Command's C-12's,C-21's, C-130's, C-5's, C-141's, and HH-3's, as well as SAC's, B-52's,and KC-135's.  So what do you think Congress did to General Gregory? You guessed it: PDSoperations and maintenance funding was totally eliminated in the House;then we in the Senate took away funding not only for the logistics command,control and communications computer-based management system, but also forthe aircraft that PDS needs, and for the forward-based stockage operations.In other words, we said: ``ship the aircraft carcasses back to the States,even though they can be repaired on site, and, we added, ``suffer the flyinghour loss in this vast theater of operations.''  Mr. President, we in this body depend on Air Force aircraft for our foreigntravel. The next time your en route from Hawaii to Hong Kong or Taiwan,clock the time you're in the air. I suggest that this experience will amplyremind you of what our PACAF pilots, logisticians, maintenance, and otheroperational personnel face on a routine basis in fulfilling the dangerousand important missions that we demand of them.

Swick, executive director of the Erie(Pennsylvania) Center for the Blind and Visually Handicapped. Mr. Swickis not a businessman_he has been in the field of social work for 24 years_yethe is concerned about the adverse effects of legislation to increase theminimum wage. Mr. Swick notes that the poor are most likely to suffer higher unemploymentwhen jobs requiring fewer skills are lost, and are hardest hit when mandatedwage increases must be met through price increases. He observes that thereare better ways to help the disadvantaged. I agree. Mr. Swick understands and appreciates the sentiment and the sincere intentof those who advocate a minimum wage increase, as we all do. But, he alsounderstands the real world and knows that this Congress will do far moreharm than good if it enacts such a bill. I hope all members of the Senatewill read and consider his views. I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the <T4>Congressional Record</T4> at this point.

As a person employedin the field of social work for 24 years, I can appreciate the motive ofthose who desire to increase the minimum wage_improving the quality oflife for those on the lower end of our economic scale. Nevertheless, Iurge you to oppose raising the minimum wage because: (1) Contrary to currentassertions, the present minimum wage is high enough to insure that thoseworking under it have a minimally acceptable standard of living; (2) increasingthe minimum wage, although it may give short run benefit, will in the longrun be counter-productive for those working at that wage level to theirgreat harm; and, (3) there are better alternatives to helping low incomepeople than increasing the minimum wage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those who advocate an increase in the minimum wage argue that peopleemployed at the current minimum wage level earn incomes below the povertylevel as defined by the Federal Government. They state that a wage earnerwith a family of four working full time at the current minimum wage earnsan income below the poverty for that 4 member family. This argument istrue; however, statistics can be misleading, and this is one of those instances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In an era when two wage earners per family is the predominant economicunit, even in middle income families, why do the people who use this statisticrestrict a low income family working at minimum wage to only one wage earner,when this is not the typical economic unit in our modern society. The factis that if a husband and wife in the ``typical'' family of four are bothwage earners employed at the minimum wage, then their ``combined'' incomeis greater than the Federally defined poverty level for a family of four.Thus, the argument that those employed at the current minimum wage haveincomes below the poverty level is really not true. Granted, the incomethat can be earned under the current minimum wage is not great; yet itis above the ``minimum'' poverty level, and this is all that the ``minimum''wage should accomplish. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is true that increasing the minimum wage can in the short run,meaning several years at most, result in a relative increase in the standardof living for those whose incomes increase as a result of the increasein the minimum wage. However, increases in the minimum wage that are excessive,going beyond providing minimal economic status at the accepted povertylevel, will in the long run have an opposite effect, and hurt the peoplewho were supposed to benefit from the increase in the minimum wage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Historically, the first thing that happens when a minimum wage increaseis granted is that those people who were earning slightly above the minimumwage prior to the increase in the minimum wage, (due to increased job responsibilities,etc.) seek to maintain their same relative economic status after the minimumwage increase by demanding a corresponding increase in their hourly wagethat will maintain the wage differential that previously existed betweentheir earnings and those earning the minimum wage. This sets off a chainreaction of bumping hourly rates throughout the economy. The result isthat short run gains achieved by increasing the minimum wage are soon erased,and the status quo is eventually restored.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Not only are the short runs gains lost over time, but the end resultis worse than the situation previous to the minimum wage increase becauseof the ugly effects of inflation. Indeed, increasing the minimum wage,with the resulting bumping of wages throughout the economy, results ininflated prices for most goods and service_and the tragic fact is thatinflation is always harder on the poor than the rich.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another disastrous result from excessive increases in the minimumwage is unemployment for the poor. When a business is faced with rapidlyincreasing labor costs, which is the case when excessive increases aremade in the minimum wage, it has several recourses. One is to raise prices,which leads to inflation, which hurts the poor especially. Another recourseis to eliminate jobs that have a high labor content through automationor some other means. The result is a shrinking number of jobs availablefor people with minimal job skills. Excessive increases in the minimumwage drive up prices and/or reduce employment opportunities for the poor,thus compounding their problems, not ameliorating them, which was the desiredintent of increasing the minimum wage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An economic fact of life in our current economy is the transitionfrom manufacturing based to service based jobs. Our country has lost manymanufacturing jobs to foreign competition. Increasing the minimum wagebeyond the level needed to maintain minimal economic survival will onlyhurt our ability to compete with foreign economic powers, thus again hurtingthe poor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the ways the poor have coped with lost manufacturing jobs isto seek employment in service occupations. It is a known economic facthowever, that most service jobs pay less than manufacturing jobs; thisis simply the inherent nature of service work. If the minimum wage is increasedsignificantly, businesses and/or people will not be able to pay the higherwages necessary to hire service workers, thus creating more unemploymentfor the poor. The last remaining bailout for the poor, which is the servicetype job, will be seriously jeopardized with any significant increase inthe minimum wage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Special problems also exist for identifiable minority groups if theminimum wage is increased significantly. Unskilled youth and marginallyproducing handicapped workers are even more vulnerable to the problemsthat develop with escalating labor prices. Unemployment is already highamong these people. This will only increase with an increase in the minimumwage. As the director of a sheltered workshop for the handicapped, I knowhow difficult it is to find labor-intensive work for sub-producing handicappedpeople. If we have to increase our prices because we must pay our peoplehigher wages with no offsetting increase in their productivity, we willbecome uncompetitive and lose contracts_and the handicapped will lose jobs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those who wish to increase the minimum wage do so with good motives.It is not their goal that is wrong (improving the standard of living ofthe poor). It is their method. As shown above, increasing the minimum wageis counter-productive. There are better ways to increase the quality ofliving for the economically disadvantaged without causing the economicdislocations that backfire on the poor when the minimum wage is inflated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One basic help for the poor is to provide job training so that lowwage earners can improve their job skills, thus increasing their abilityto earn higher wages. All economies have ``entry'' level jobs that arerelatively poor paying. In our earlier years we had apprentices who indenturedthemselves for the opportunity to learn a trade and eventually become well-paidcraftsmen.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is nothing inherently wrong in paying a person a low wage forentry level work. Entry level jobs require minimal skills and trainingand therefore do not demand a high wage. What is wrong is not providingpeople with the opportunity for training so they can increase their jobskills, thus allowing them to move up from entry level positions. The factis, overpaying workers for entry level jobs reduces the incentive to improvejob skills. In the long run no economy can pay a person more than he isworth_but a person can be made worth more economically by training so hecan be more productive and hence able to earn more.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to job training there are other effective ways to helpthe poor without increasing the minimum wage. Subsidized day care can enablepoor families to have two wage earners without the expensive overhead ofday care. Tax relief can be provided through legislation so that lowerwage earners can retain a higher percentage of their earnings. Medicalcare can be provided to lower income people so that they do not have tohave their lower earnings consumed for this necessity. There are many thingsthat our society can do to support and upgrade the poor besides increasingthe minimum wage.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is probably politically popular to increase the minimum wage, butit it not good policy. I urge you to reject any significant increase inthe minimum wage, and instead provide programs and economic developmentthat will provide long term solutions to a chronic problem.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Sincerely,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="57">Tyco V.

Mr. President, last week I visited Turkey as part of a delegationheaded by Senator <T4>Dole. </T4>This gave me the opportunity to discuss the Armenian genocideissue with Turkey's President Kenan Evren and Prime Minister Turgut Ozal.By way of background, over the years, I have corresponded with Turkishleaders and United States officials regarding a simple request of Armeniansthroughout the world, that is, for the Government of Turkey and other governments,including our own, to recognize the Armenian genocide as an historicalfact.Several years ago, I wrote to Prime Minister Ozal to encourage the openingof the Ottoman Empire Archives to history scholars from around the world.Since that time, some progress has been made in making some of these recordsavailable to foreign researchers. Unfortunately, much more needs to bedone to give interested scholars the opportunity to examine the OttomanArchives. Many believe that access to these documents can further substantiatethe historicity of the Armenian genocide. Thus, it is important that allrecords regarding that tragedy be preserved.Last week, I spoke with President Kenan Evren and Prime Minister Ozal regardingthe opening up of the archives. They assured me that the Ottoman recordsincreasingly will be made available to foreign researchers. I made thepoint that it would be in the best interest of the Republic of Turkey toopen the Archives of the Ottoman Turk Empire.It is painful to admit mistakes, but denying them only aggravates the grievancesassociated with or resulting from them. In this instance I have noted repeatedlythat the cruel treatment of Armenians earlier in this century occurredat the hands of Ottoman Empire authorities, not at the hands of authoritiesunder the Republic of Turkey. Surely this important distinction providesample basis for the current Government of Turkey to cooperate in effortsto recognize officially the mistakes of the predecessor imperial regime.These are not the errors of the republican government.Again, I applaud the Turkish leaders' support for a further opening ofthe Ottoman Archives. I hope this process will proceed both accuratelyand quickly. In addition, Mr. President, I urge all of our colleagues tolook once again at the merits of Senate Joint Resolution 43, the jointresolution designating a ``National Day of Remembrance for the Victimsof the Armenian Genocide,'' and urge more Senators to become cosponsorsof it.[S13MY8-1397]{S5801}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1398]{S5801}TESTIMONY <ITAG tagnum="81">TESTIMONY ON THE INF TREATY BY MR. SVEN KRAEMER</ITAG>[S13MY8-1399]{S5801}WALLOPMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, the proposed Treaty on Intermediate-range NuclearForces [INF] now coming before the U.S. Senate for advice and consent hasprofound implications for our future. At stake are United States nationalsecurity, NATO deterrence, and fundamental principles of arms control andfuture United States-Soviet relations.As the Senate considers this treaty, I wish to call the special attentionof my Senate colleagues and the American people to the extraordinary testimonyrecently presented on these vital issues by a uniquely knowledgeable formeradministration official. On February 19 he testified before the ForeignRelations Committee of the U.S. Senate. His prepared statement portraysthe flaws and dangers evident in the proposed treaty and in the temptationsof summit fever as the United States approaches the next United States-Sovietsummit scheduled to be held in Moscow May 29 to June 2.I refer to the expert witness provided by Mr. Sven Kraemer, who servedas the Director of Arms Control on the staff of the National Security Council[NSC] from the first days of the Reagan administration in early 1981 untillast September. For nearly 7 years he represented the National SecurityCouncil in some 10 interagency arms control groups, and provided seniorlevel staff support to the National Security Advisor and the President.In view of his White House role and his testimony, I am astonished thathis testimony has received no media coverage whatsoever and probably remainsunknown even to most of my Senate colleagues. Surely more than any otherofficial who has testified on the proposed treaty, Mr. Kraemer brings directprofessional knowledge of the objectives, policies and processes whichthe Reagan White House brought to U.S. arms control policy.A personal note submitted with his prepared statement indicates that Mr.Kraemer did not find it easy to testify critically on this treaty. However,with each summit meeting, and in the end results as we find them in thetreaty before the Senate today, he, like others, clearly found increasingreasons for concern. When called to testify, he did so as a matter of conscienceand <ITAG tagnum="80">he offered his critiques and recommendations not to criticise PresidentReagan, but in the name of the President's own declared objectives.</ITAG>Mr. Kraemer's testimony has unusual credibility. He is intimately familiarwith the Reagan administration's senior-level decisions on arms controland how these differed from those of prior administrations. And, he bringsto his testimony not only the broad perspective of some 25 years of governmentservice since the Kennedy administration, but also a unique White Houseexperience of 16 years of service on the NSC staff with 10 National SecurityAdvisors in the administrations of Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, andReagan.Mr. Kraemer's testimony details numerous fundamental and unresolved flawsin the proposed treaty, several of these apparently resulting from lastminute United States accommodations to Soviet negotiating pressure at summitmeetings and in ministerial meetings involving the United States Secretaryof State and the Soviet Foreign Minister. These flaws include major datadiscrepancies, ineffective United States verification, high-risk Sovietverification, repudiation of the President's arms control compliance policy,and grave implications for the START negotiations and for SDI.Mr. Kraemer provides a sobering picture of the treaty's dangerous consequencesfor NATO deterrence. We will be removing our most effective deterrent inthe absence of NATO funding of required nuclear and conventional forcemodernization. However, the treaty is not effectively verifiable and theSoviets can retain their missile capabilities either covertly or throughtheir surfeit in retargetable strategic systems such as the SS-25 and SS-24ICBM's. Furthermore, the NATO countries do not have the requisite modernizationprograms underway for their nuclear, conventional, and chemical deterrentforces, and Socialist and ``green'' parties will use the agreement to encourageless, rather than more defense investment, and to promote unsound armscontrol agreements involving nuclear, chemical, and conventional forces.Numerous witnesses and diplomatic observers have focussed on specific provisionsand problems of the treaty. Mr. Kraemer focusses on a host of such specificproblems and offers a broad range of recommended treaty changes and safeguards.But just as significantly for the Senate's deliberations, he portrays therelated dangers of the current broader U.S. policy framework of which theINF Treaty is a component. He demonstrates the fateful relationship betweenthe proposed INF Treaty and the other dangerously flawed components ofthe summit package for the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting to be held in Moscowlater this spring.As described by Mr. Kraemer, the realistic arms control and foreign policyprinciples which President Reagan brought to the White House in 1981 haveof late been increasingly pushed aside by summit fever. Mr. Kraemer portraysadministration policy as increasingly disregarding the bitter lessons ofthe 1970's period <ITAG tagnum="80">of so-called deandCx.174;1tente, when United States arms control andforeign policy were based on illusions about fundamental changes in Sovietbehavior both at home and abroad. Mr. Kraemer notes how, with the proposedINF Treaty and with the other components of United States-Soviet summitry,the Reagan administration has fallen prey to dangerous new illusions thattragically endanger our security and our freedoms. </ITAG>Mr. President, at this time the U.S. Senate has completed its hearingson ratification of the proposed INF Treaty. Ministerial-level meetingsbetween Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadzehave intensified in preparing for the Moscow summit. But the fundamentalproblems in the treaty and in the broader summit package presciently testifiedto by Mr. Kraemer several months ago have increased rather than gone away.These problems are becoming more evident every day in spite of the administration'sefforts to dismiss them or to cover them up. START, SDI chemical weapons,nuclear testing, Afghanistan, trade, and other new agreements all appearto be subjects to be negotiated at the summit table. The administration continues to push for new agreements and for early ratificationof the proposed INF Treaty, without thoroughgoing consideration, debateor amendment. But, Mr. President, it is our constitutional duty to providefor the common defense. And we are obligated not simply to consent, butalso to advise on proposed treaties. We surely cannot accept the view advanced by administration spokesmen,and apparently shared even by some of my Senate colleagues, that the proposedINF Treaty is being presented to the Senate for advice and consent forour automatic approval on a ``take it or leave it'' basis and that it cannotbe amended by the Senate or discussed further with the Soviets. No, Mr. President, the INF Treaty and the summit scheduled later this monthare far too serious for that. The stakes are far too high. The United Statesnow stands at a major watershed and many of us are profoundly concernedabout the unfolding crisis in our defense and our diplomacy. I call special attention to Mr. Kraemer's analysis, his Churchillian warningsabout the dangers of summit fever, and his recommended policy considerationsfor changes in the treaty and for a long-term United States strategy onmeeting the Soviet challenge. His statement is an important contributionto our deliberations here and to the national debate on this treaty andits broader implications. Mr. Kraemer's testimony has not received one syllable of media coverage.Yet his statement, I believe, should be must reading for all Senators reviewingthe INF Treaty and all Americans who care seriously about their securityand their freedoms. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Kraemer's prepared statementand his accompanying personal note to the Foreign Relations Committee ofthe U.S. Senate be entered into the <T4>Congressional Record.</T4> There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record</T4>, as follows: [S13MY8-1400]{S5802}Prepared S<ITAG tagnum="74">Prepared Statement of Sven F.

The issues we arediscussing are of great consequence for our nation's future.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a former Senate staff member, and currently assigned to a Houseof Representatives staff, I have a direct personal appreciation of thevital role of the United States Senate, and of the Congress as a whole.In sharing responsibility with the Executive Branch for our country's defenseand foreign policy. Your responsibilities are great.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Let me begin with a personal note to put my testimony into perspective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is not at all easy for me to be here today to criticize the proposedINF treaty. But I believe profound concern is warranted by fundamentalflaws, illusions and dangers increasingly associated with this treaty andwith related US policy on arms control and US-Soviet relations. In my brief,informal opening remarks I will be drawing on a substantially more extensiveanalysis of these issues that I am providing for consideration by you andyour Senate colleagues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the outset of my testimony, I would like you to understand thatI truly wish I could affirm this treaty and be optimistic about our policyand about purported changes in Soviet behavior. I have worked on theseissues for a long time, spending many difficult hours wrestling with theserious problems involved. I also know first hand the meaning of war andthe importance of deterring it. I spent my early childhood as a Britishcitizen held in Germany during World War II, and later as an NSC stafferI made nine official visits to wartime Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It has been my chosen vocation to work on arms control, foreign policyand defense issues since I entered government service some twenty-fiveyears ago. Much has passed since that time in 1963 when I joined the KennedyAdministration in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For nine years from 1967 to 1976 and for nearly seven more years from1981 until last September, I worked on the National Security Council staffin the White House. At the NSC I served four presidents_Johnson, Nixon,Ford and Reagan. During those sixteen years on the NSC Staff, I servedwith 10 National Security Advisors (Rostow, Kissinger, Scowcroft, Allen,Clark,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">McFarlane, Poindexter, Keel, Carlucci, and Powell). I had two otherNational Security Advisors as professors before they took on that awesomeresponsibility (Bundy and Brzezinski). I also served here as a Senate stafferwith Senator John Tower for two years in the late 70's. I currently serveas an Associate Staff Member of the Appropriations Committee's ForeignOperations Subcommittee of the House of Representatives and with CongressmanJack Kemp (R-NY).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During my government service I have learned that sound arms controlefforts are far more difficult to achieve within and by the US Governmentthan is generally understood outside the Government. In the academies,the churches or the media, it all seems simpler and the solutions moreobvious.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I have found that our national government, and particularly our president,must address arms control problems from a perspective which has the primeconstitutional obligation ``to provide for the common defense.'' Thereis the daily reality of defense, deterrence and past history. There isthe reality that other nations are sovereign powers, and that some powersare hostile to democracies such as ours and are provoked by our weaknessrather than by our strength_our moral, economic and military strength.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I tend increasingly to observe that democracies do not use arms tolaunch wars against each other. It is dictatorships, particularly totalitariandictatorships, that extend their intolerance and their wars against theirown people to subversion and war abroad. Ultimately, therefore, the bestbasis for arms control would be to have the protections and tolerance ofdemocracy throughout the globe. In this respect, the struggle for effectivearms control must be directly linked to the struggle for the protectionand expansion of freedom.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the various government positions in which I have served,I know that our nation's arms control efforts involve an exceptionallydifficult pilgrimage for those officials who seriously set out on thispath. This pilgrimage brings important ethical imperatives that set visionarygoals that provide what appear to be easy recipe solutions. Like ``nuclearfreeze'' proposals which engendered much fervor in recent years, such recipeswould soon lead us into worse situations. The arms control pilgrimage surelyinvolves exceptional complexities and serious dilemmas. High goals, yes,but also high risks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My long-standing support and personal admiration for President Reaganmakes my witness today particularly difficult for me. I wish my words couldreach him directly, so that he would know I was speaking in support ofhis principles, not against him. I have long consciously supported theinsights of Ronald Reagan, as governor, candidate and president.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/>[S13MY8-1401]{S5803}<ITAG tagnum="21">As an NSC staffer in the 1970's I shared Ronald Reagan's and SenatorHenry ``Scoop'' Jackson's deep concerns about our nation's so-called ``detente''policies. During President Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, I servedon his Platform Committee staff and had a senior staff responsibility indrafting the foreign policy and arms control sections of the platform onwhich he ran.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">President Reagan's 1980 platform, with which he won a strong nationalmandate, was for a policy of realism and peace through strength in thecause of freedom. That mandate was overwhelmingly reaffirmed by the Americanpeople in the elections of 1984. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When Ronald Reagan became President, I joined his 1980 Defense Departmenttransition team. Shortly after his inauguration, I joined his NationalSecurity Council Staff and worked closely with each of his National SecurityAdvisors. For most of the past seven years, until the end of last August,I shared major arms control responsibilities within a small staff groupthat included public servants of the highest caliber and integrity. AsDirector of Arms Control I worked on analyses and options for the Presidentand represented the NSC in some ten interagency groups on arms controlfrom early 1981 until last fall. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It was an enormous privilege to serve in the NSC family with thisPresident. I care about the NSC people who work so hard against great bureaucraticodds. I care about President Reagan, whom our countrymen love, more thanany other person I have ever served. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regretably, I have had to come to the conclusion that the INF treatyand its associated current policy framework on arms control and US-Sovietrelations endanger America and our allies. We are in a deepening defenseand diplomatic crisis. I firmly believe, that the proposed INF treaty andthe larger U.S.-Soviet policy framework do <T3>not </T3>reflect President Reagan's declared objectives. The evidenceis becoming clearer every day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the other hand I believe I and many other serious people who haveexpressed concern about the proposed treaty and the broader context ofcurrent policies are faithful to the President's proven insights and objectives.I regret that in the last months of his Presidency these insights and objectivesare increasingly being pushed aside within the Executive Branch and theCongress. If this trend is not rapidly reversed, I truly fear for our nation'sfuture. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Let me turn now to some of the specific major problems I see in thecontent and in the policy context of the proposed INF treaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/> [S13MY8-1402]{S5803}The INF Tr<ITAG tagnum="74">The INF Treaty, Summit Fever and the Deepening Crisis in America'sDefense and Diplomacy</ITAG>[S13MY8-1403]{S5803}summary<ITAG tagnum="89">summary</ITAG>[S13MY8-1404]{S5803}<ITAG tagnum="21">America and her Free World Allies face a deepening crisis in theirdefense and in their diplomacy. The crisis is leading to an unfolding tragedycaused by the pressure and illusions of summit fever. Its elements areemerging most clearly in the fundamental flaws and risks evident in theproposed INF treaty and in the framework of future negotiations at theUS-Soviet summit to take place in Moscow this May. The tragedy can onlybe avoided by realism about required changes to the treaty, about the increasedthreats to our security and freedom, and about the need for a new course.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Profound concerns are raised by the INF treaty and its associatedsummit package. These concerns include the treaty's data discrepanciesand verification problems and its adverse impact on deterrence, futurearms control and US-Soviet relations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The concerns also include possible political bargains during the treaty'sratification process that would delay the early, phased deployment of ourStrategic Defense Initiative (SDI)_our nation's best defense insurancepolicy. SDI is endangered by Congressional and diplomatic restrictionsbeing imposed on US programs even though the Soviet Union is violatingexisting treaties, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In theory, the INF treaty stands on its own merits, is effectivelyverifiable and will result in some four Soviet weapons being dismantledfor every US weapon. In theory, the proposed treaty is to bring a zero-zeroresult for an important class of US and Soviet weapon systems_the longer-and shorter-range land-based INF systems. In theory, Soviet military capabilitiesand threats to peace will be reduced and stability will be increased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In theory, NATO will modernize its remaining nuclear and non-nuclearsystems to bring them to the required levels to deter far larger Sovietnuclear, conventional and chemical forces. In theory, the treaty will behelpful to the arms control process and to fostering a more moderate SovietUnion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In theory, the INF treaty may sound good for arms control and security,and as fulfilling the arms criteria established by President Reagan. Thereality, however, is very different.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As reviewed in the following analysis, the result of the INF treatyand its related May summit package, in practice is far more likely to be<T3>zero for our own</T3> most credible deterrent forces in Europe anda substantial <T3>increase in Soviet</T3> military</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">capability and in its political and diplomatic influence vis a visour NATO allies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It will be relatively easy under the treaty for the Soviet Union toincrease its military capabilities against NATO, covertly or by circumvention,by retargeting extra Soviet strategic missiles which are very similar tothe INF systems the Soviets are supposed to dismantle. At the same time,the removal of the US missiles, the aura of a new ``Detente II'' summitryand the effect of increased Soviet diplomatic and disinformation effortswill weaken NATO deterrence. Pressure will increase against NATO modernization,for unsound arms control agreements and for Europe's denuclearisation andneutralization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This likely result in Europe of the proposed INF treaty, will be tothe very significant advantage of the Soviet Union and to the great detrimentof NATO deterrence and global stability. In the broader framework of USpolicy on arms control and US-Soviet relations, the implications and priceof the INF treaty will be high, the risks to US and Allied security andfreedom great.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed INF treaty and its related negotiations package for theMay summit relate directly to strategic arms reductions negotiations (START)and to SDI and have serious adverse consequences for both. In the currentsteamroller rush toward a START treaty to be readied for the May summit,serious START issues are likely to be brushed aside and the fundamentaldata and verification problems evident. Yet the flawed INF treaty willbe greatly compounded in START.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SID faces two clear dangers. First, there appears to be a pre-ratificationdeal between White House and Senate Democrats commiting the United Statesto a ``narrow'' treaty interpretation which would seriously restrict theUS test programs. Second, there is a likely summit package commiting theUS to a seven to ten year US adherence to the ABM Treaty. In view of Sovietviolations of the ABM Treaty, such US commitments would be unilateral whilethey would paralyse the accelerated, phased deployment of our nation'sbest defense insurance policy_SDI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We would thus be severely constraining and delaying early deploymentof our own strategic defenses even though the ABM treaty has been brokenby Soviet violations and even though there is increasing evidence of theSoviet Union's acceleration of its strategic defense program across a broadspectrum of deployment options leading to a full breakout from the ABMTreaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The INF-Summit package that is currently emerging rewards Soviet violationsof existing treaties with unsound arms control, and unsound political andnegotiations bargains on SDI. In addition, we can anticipate the INF Summitto cause the US to downplay Soviet human rights abuses and Soviet internationalaggression and to increase official US encouragement of a generous flowof new commercial credits and advanced technology to the Soviet Union.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Administration and Congressional proponents of the INF treaty urgean early vote on the merits of the INF treaty alone. They not only dismissthe treaty's fundamental flaws as serious, but also insist that ratificationnot be linked to consideration of any of the broader policy issues above.Yet the treaty's supporters also praise the INF treaty as a <T3>first </T3>step in a <T3>series </T3>of US-Soviet agreements to be inaugurated at the next summit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the national debate on the proposed INF treaty it is now clearlynecessary for the treaty's supporters and critics alike to consider thetreaty as a component of a far broader negotiations package emerging forthe Moscow summit this May.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is essential that the proposed treaty be evaluated in direct connectionwith its broader summit context to include realistic assessments of militantSoviet behavior and future US-Soviet relations. The treaty and all otheraspects of the May summit, must be evaluated not only in terms of theirown merits and flaws, but also in terms of their broader military and diplomaticimpact and in terms of the national requirement for an integrated longer-termstrategy for dealing with the continuing Soviet challenge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/>[S13MY8-1405]{S5803}i_summit f<ITAG tagnum="89">i_summit fever and rationales for rushing to praise and ratify theinf treaty </ITAG>[S13MY8-1406]{S5803}<ITAG tagnum="21">The INF treaty has been caught in the rush of summit fever.

For example,they view as decisive precedents the Soviet Union's agreement, in principle,to deep asymetrical force reductions and to on-site inspections. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those who divine fundamental Soviet policy changes, hope that theSoviet Union will now, with this INF treaty, somehow change its historicalpattern of negotiation deceptions and treaty violations. They place theirtrust in new Soviet words and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">overlook the proposed treaty's basic flaws and the Soviet Union'scontinuing military buildup and aggression. They assume the proposed asymetricalforce reductions will verifiably take place on the Soviet side withoutcircumvention. They also tend to see the treaty as a vital and indispensiblestep in an accelerating process toward other agreements with the SovietUnion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those who feel this way need first to face up fully to the flaws andadverse impact of the treaty exposed during the ratification hearings.They should help assure that these are corrected. In addition, the Congressshould give a full hearing to knowledgable Soviet exiles, like VladimirBukovsky and Natan Sharansky, who can testify to the continuing realitiesand threats of Soviet power.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1410]{S5804}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Allied Reaction. </T3>Some argue that treaty rejection, or conditionsor safeguards attached by the Congress, would raise profound politicalconcerns for our European Allies.

They may then recognize theneed for major amendments, reservations and safeguards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If some in the Senate would now rush this necessary review process,they should remember that the text of the treaty was not forwarded to theCongress until January 25, some seven weeks after it had been signed atthe December 7 summit, presumably because of ongoing problems in its dataand its provisions. Furthermore, the treaty's negotiating record, requestedby some in the Congress, was not forwarded until February 12. This recordwill apparently play an important role for those who requested it and mayengender new concerns and debate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">January 25 and February 12 are relatively recent dates. The treaty'sfull consideration should not suffer from unrealistic deadlines. It mustbe recognized that the serious questions relating to the treaty_past Sovietviolations, data discrepancies, ineffective verification, weakened deterrence,postponed SDI, delinkage from broader aspects of Soviet behavior, etc._simplycannot be wished away by treaty proponents.

Thedebate must recognize the critical situation brought about by failed armscontrol approaches, diplomatic illusions about our principal adversaries,by growing threats, and by the cumulative impact of the declining US defenseinvestment, which is now in its fourth year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One's view of the INF treaty and its wider policy context is significantlyaffected by how one views the Soviet Union. It is apparent that treatyproponents hoping for fundamental Soviet change appear ready to take majorrisks with US and Allied security. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In contrast, most critics of the INF treaty believe that, far frommoderating Soviet behavior, the INF treaty is likely to be exploited militarilyand politically by the Soviet Union. They tend to view the major foreignthreats to the United States and her allies as deriving principally fromthe soviet Union. They see the Soviet Union as fundamentally remainingwhat it has been for 70 years_since its first leaders overthrew the SocialDemocratic government that had replaced the Russian czars. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In fact, the evidence of Soviet actions demonstrates that the SovietUnion remains a revolutionary and expansionist totalitarian regime. Asin the past, it is ruled repressively by a hierarchical party holding amonopoly of power and privilege. The Communist Party and the Soviet Unionremain bunkered behind their Berlin Walls and Iron Curtains determinedto expand their power globally so long as any democracies remain outsidetheir total control. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Today, new Soviet leaders are using a new vocabulary of ``glasnost''and ''perestroika.'' they claim new ``openness'' and ``restructuring.''Such Soviet words, a more adroit Soviet public diplomacy and an intensiveSoviet disinformation effort have proved seductive in the democratic westeven though basic Soviet realities remain fundamentally unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Reformist Soviet words notwithstanding, the leaders of the CommunistParty of the Soviet Union have not yielded their party's monopoly powers.They have not permitted free speech, free elections and free worship. Theyhave not torn down their walls of political apartheid, or closed down theirgulag. They have not reviewed their military buildup, let their alliesbe independent, or pulled their troops and those of their militant alliesout of Aghanistan, Angola, Central America and Southeast Asia. Though theGorbachev doctrine may not sound like the Brezhnev Doctrine, it is essentiallythe same. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The new Soviet leaders have brought new illusions and dangers as theself-deceptive temptation persists throughout the Western democracies toignore the realities and lessons of past and present Soviet behavior.

In addition, the Helsinki Final Act of1975 included human rights and confidence building measures (CBMs) to reducethe risks of war. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each of these international agreements was fully complied with bythe United States and each was violated by the Soviet Union. The arms controltreaties had serious verification problems and asymetrical adverse impactson U.S. security. The Helsinki Accords were violated and the Helsinki Monitorsarrested throughout the Soviet Block. The Accords' confidence-building-measureswere violated in a large-scale Soviet military exercise directed againstPoland. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The two strategic arms limitation agreements (SALT I and SALT II)incorporated a strange form of supposed ``arms control.'' They includedserious verification problems and legitimized major U.S.-Soviet inequitiesand large increases in the number of Soviet strategic ballistic missilewarheads. The ABM treaty also involved major ambiguities, problems andrisks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>The SALT I ``Interim'' Agreement of 1972</T3> (an Executive Agreement,not a treaty) was scheduled to expire in 1977. It was highly unequal inits designated weapons ceilings, permitted substantial growth and gavethe Soviets major advantages. The agreement was accompanied by the JacksonAmendment and by Joint Chiefs of Staff testimony requesting future armscontrol equalities and robust ongoing U.S. defense modernization and researchprograms as safeguards. However, the concerns expressed in the Amendmentand by the JCS were left essentially unmet even as the Soviet Union cynicallyexploited the SALT I Agreement throughout the 1970's. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>The proposed SALT II Treaty of 1979</T3> was described by the SenateArmed Services Committee as ``unequal in favor of the Soviet Union,'' andas ``not in the national security interests of the United States of America.''It was headed for substantial amendments or outright defeat and was finallyscuttled by </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">President Carter, without being ratified, following the Soviet invasionof Afghanistan in December 1979.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The <T3>ABM Treaty of 1972</T3> involved numerous ambiguities and held theUnited States in a deterrent posture of exclusive reliance on MAD (MutualAssured Destruction). It led to a substantial reduction in US researchand development programs on strategic defense, even as the Soviet Unionincreased its own efforts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These flawed and violated agreements were permitted to stand for years.Although the SALT I Agreement had expired in 1977 and was violated by theSoviets, the United States did not put SALT I behind us until 1986. Similarly,the SALT II Treaty, though unratified and violated by the Soviets in itscore provisions, was also not put behind us until 1986, some months afterthe December 31, 1987 date when it was scheduled to expire had it beenratified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Surprisingly, some members of Congress still urge unilateral US adherenceto the SALT I and SALT II agreements. And to this day the US continuesto adhere unilaterally to the ABM Treaty and to argue about ``broad'' or``narrow'' interpretations of the treaty as if the treaty had not longago been broken by Soviet violations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is time to assure unequivocably that the failed arms control approachesof the 1970's are rejected as precedents for the INF treaty. Historically,unsound arms control agreements have assumed a life of their own in restrictingUS programs_notwithstanding a lack of equality, lack of ratification andthe evidence of Soviet violations.

In the strategic area, the US: conceledthe B-1 strategic bomber; delayed the MX ICBM, the D-5 ``Trident'' SLBM,and strategic cruise missile production; terminated MX ICBM production;put our strategic defense research on the back burner and closed down ourABM facilities at Grand Forks AFB, N.D. While the Soviets continued theirbuildup, the US unilaterally reduced the number of its nuclear weaponsby </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">about one-third and reduced its nuclear megatonage by three-fourths.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1420]{S5805}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>US Retrenchment andamp; US Credits. </T3>While reducing its defensesthe US also retrenched abroad. This included the withdrawal of all US combatforces from South Vietnam in 1973 and the surrender in 1975 of our alliesthere and in Cambodia and Laos to North Vietnam's Soviet-supplied divisions,which crudely broke the Armistice Accords the North Vietnamese had signedand the Soviets had guaranteed two years earlier.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During the ``detente'' period the US rejected linkage with Sovietmilitary aggression or human rights abuses (with Administrations opposedto the Jackson-Vannick Amendment) and the US provided generous creditsand advanced technology to the Soviets. We thereby underpinned the Sovietmilitary-industrial complex and bailed out the backward Soviet economy,while undercutting fundamental economic and political reforms. Caught bythe same illusory self-deception, our allies succumbed to similar policies.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1421]{S5805}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>``Detente'' Critics. </T3>In the 1970's, as now, there were those likeSenator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and Ronald Reagan who sounded Churchillianalarms about the continued totalitarian challenge and who proposed morerealistic policies toward the Soviet Union. Such critics were denounced,as similar voices are today. They were said to be opposed to peace, inappropriatelyto link diverse aspects of Soviet behavior and US-Soviet relations, and(in President Carter's phrase) to have ``an inordinate fear of Communism.''</ITAG>[S13MY8-1422]{S5805}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Soviet Build-up and Expansionism. </T3>The historical facts at thattime clearly contradicted official optimism and backed the critics of ``DetenteI.'' In sharp contrast with US restraint during the 70's ``detente'' period,the Soviet Union pocketed America's misplaced trust and stepped up itsarms buildup on an unprecedented scale. The Soviets deployed a vast arraryof new weapons systems as we reduced or postponed major US programs. Atthe same time, the Soviet Union violated its major international obligationson arms control, international behavior and human rights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During the ``detente'' period, the Soviet leaders were far from practicing``peaceful coexistence'' and ``negotiation, not confrontation, as theyhad promised in the US-Soviet ``Moscow Declaration'' in 1972. Instead,they their Block's militant allies to go on the attack, waging war withtens of thousands of invasion troops in South Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos(1975), Angola (1975) and Ethiopia (1976). In the Middle East, the Sovietsegged on their allies to attack Israel, most notably during the Yom KippurWar of 1973, and to attack US interests and diplomats in Iran in 1979.Afghanistan was invaded by Soviet divisions in 1979. Soviet-directed subversionwas stepped up in Central and South America. During the ``detente'' decade,Soviet-supported terrorist efforts and disinformation campaigns notablyincreased throughout the world.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Within their own Block, the Soviets pressured their Polish alliesnot to undertake major reforms desired by the Polish people. Practicingno moderation in their imperial ambitions and activities abroad, the Sovietleaders violated the international human rights standards of the HelsinkiFinal Act and made no fundamental reforms with regard to their repressivetotalitarian system at home or within their Block.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the face of the reality that 1970's ``detente'' was a unilateralhope, the West's ``detente'' illusions persisted and its vulnerabilitiesincreased with each passing year.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1423]{S5805}iv_reagan <ITAG tagnum="89">iv_reagan realism and peace through strength in the cause of freedom_afocus on the reagan arms control criteria</ITAG>[S13MY8-1424]{S5805}<ITAG tagnum="21">Today we should remember that until the presidency of Ronald Reagan,most in the Executive Branch and in the Congress, as well as most of ourdemocratic Allies, simply refused to recognize the truth about this abysmalSoviet ``detente'' record even as the Soviet Union continued its aggressivebehavior and as the danger to our security and our freedom increased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Until President Reagan's leadership brought a dramatic change, mostsenior US officials in the Carter, Ford and Nixon administrations, withvery rare exceptions, fell prey to self-deceptive illusions of the 1970's``detente.'' thus, they opposed sound arms control standards; neglectedrequisite US defense modernization, including strategic defense; rejectedefforts to resist Soviet aggression and support freedom fighters abroad;and downplayed the need for stepping up broadcasts and other efforts toreach out to those in the Soviet Block and throughout the world yearningfor peace with freedom.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the clearest changes in policy from his predecessors occuredearly in President Reagan's first Administration in the area of US-Sovietrelations and arms control. Those who today claim that the proposed INFtreaty and the overall framework of current US policy on arms control andUS-Soviet relations conform with those declared Reagan policies, need torefresh their memory about his 1980 campaign and his subsequent policydeclarations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Drawing on numerous official statements, reports and directives, PresidentReagan's chief arms control objectives and related policy perspectivescould be summarized as follows:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1425]{S5805}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Arms control is not an end in itself, but should be related directlyto US defense and linked to Soviet behavior. It should be undertaken andjudged in terms of whether or not it contributes to US and Allied securityand global stability. From this perspective, reaching no agreement is betterthan concluding a bad agreement and the best safeguard for deterring waris a policy of peace through strength.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1426]{S5805}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. Arms control should not be divorced from the broader aspects ofSoviet military and political behavior, including aggression aborad andsuppression of human rights at home.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1427]{S5805}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. Arms control must not legitimize arms buildups, or merely slowthe rate of growth, as had the arms ``escalation'' agreements SALT I andII. Instead, there should be significant reductions. In November 1981 theUS proposed deep reductions to zero in Soviet and US INF systems and inMay 1982 proposed a 1/3, or more, out in strategic ballistic missiles andabout a 1/2 out in their warheads (intended to lead to equitable, effectivelyverifiable and stabilizing results).</ITAG>[S13MY8-1428]{S5805}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. Arms reductions must be to equal and stabilizing levels and remainingUS forces must be able to carry out their assigned missions of deterranceand defense.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1429]{S5805}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5. Arms control agreements must be ``effectively'' verifiable in alltheir provisions. This policy consciously contrasted with prior administrationsviews (e.g. the Carter Administration) that ``adequate'' verfication wassufficient if violations could be detected in time to prevent (some undefined)``unacceptable'' military risks.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1430]{S5806}6.<ITAG tagnum="21">6. To be serious about arms control is to be serious about full Sovietcompliance. There was to be no coverup of Soviet violations, as candidateReagan had charged in his 1980 platform about the Carter Administration.President Reagan's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and disarmament,as well as a high level interagency Arms Control Verification Committeewere requested by the President early in his Administration to preparedetailed reports to the President, and later to the Congress, describingthe extensive pattern of Soviet arms control violations. Full Soviet complaincewith all treaty provisions were declared to be a prerequisite for any futurearms control agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In sum, when President Reagan's declared arms control objectives andcriteria above are applied to the proposed INF treaty currently beforethe Congress and to the broader summit package, it is demonstrably clearhow substantially these have been undermined and pushed aside recentlyby summit fever and US concessions.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1431]{S5806}v_the inf <ITAG tagnum="89">v_the inf treaty's fatal flaws and dangers_reagan realism and armscontrol objectives abandoned</ITAG>[S13MY8-1432]{S5806}<ITAG tagnum="21">INF Treaty proponents ask that the treaty be judged and quickly ratifiednow on its own merits. They are insistent that its consideration not belinked to any broader issues of other arms control negotiations, Sovietbehavior and U.S.-Soviet relations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proponents claim two chief merits in particular for the treaty: (1)asymetrical reductions and (2) on-site verification. In theory, these constituteimpressive U.S. negotiation accomplishments which mark very significantimprovements over the moratoria or small reductions propoposed for so manyyears by the Soviet Union and over the moratoria (whether unilateral orbilateral) proposed by U.S. advocates of a nuclear ``freeze.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed below, however, these two most highly touted pillarsof the proposed treaty in practice do not pass careful scrutiny and deservea far less optimistic assessment. In fact, both the reduction and the verificationpillars of the INF tready can be circumvented fairly easily by the SovietUnion and both bring major new risks to us and our Allies. In practice,NATO will lose a unique deterrent capability and sensitive classified information,while the Soviet Union will retain the capability to get back everythingit give at the negotiation table and more.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As reviewed below, the United States would be significantly worseoff militarily and politicallly in Europe with this INF treaty than weare now without it and than we were before NATO's ``double track'' decisionof December 1979. Our best nuclear deterrent in NATO would have been removed,with major new pressures encouraged for rapidly removing even more of ourdeterrent without having assured corresponding NATO defense modernizationprograms to meet the Soviet threat. Meanwhile, under the treaty the SovietUnion could readily retain military capabilities equal to or subtantiallygreater than they currently possess.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Set against President Reagan's sound and long-standing arms controlcriteria described above, the major flaws directly associated with theproposed INF Treaty and requiring amendment, reservation and/or programaticsafeguard include the following:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1433]{S5806}A.

Strict compliance with all provisions of arms control agreements is fundamental,and this Administration will not accept anything less.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Unanswered Inquiries. </T3>Explicit Congressional inquiries to theAdministration on this fundamental policy matter (as in January 1988 correspondencefrom Congressman Jack Kemp to Secretary of State Shultz) have been leftunanswered by US officials even though Members had sought explanationsand a reversal of this repudiation of the President's stated compliancepolicy.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1434]{S5806}B.

These include inadequate missile photos (e.g. for the SS-20and SS-23) and missile and launcher numbers and sites as provided by theSoviets. Such data discrepancies have been publicly outlined in questionsfrom Congressman Jack Kemp to the Secretary of State and in the SenateForeign Relations Committee's Minority Staff report of January 25, 1988on the INF Treaty: Does It Decrease_Or Increase_The Danger of Nuclear War?''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Major INF treaty data problems include the following:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1435]{S5806}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>The INF Treaty's ``Backfire Problem.'' </T3>If the US does not resolvethe wide range of data problems before treaty ratification, it is invitingmassive problems <T3>after </T3>ratification. Without such a resolution, the US cannot haveany assurance that we are verifying the treaty's required dismantlements.We would be repeating on a treaty-wide scale the ``Backfire Problem'' ofSALT II in which US negotiations during the Carter Administration acceptedas valid Soviet information and claims about the Soviet Backfire's rangeand capability which were invalid when we received them and which shouldhave been rejected outright as a fraud.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1436]{S5806}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>SS-20 and SS-23 Missile Photos. </T3>The INF treaty's SS-20 photo wasfirst inappropriately provided at the December 1987 summit as a facsimilecopy, was then delivered weeks late and has left continuing major doubtsabout its accuracy. The Soviets' murky SS-23 photo omitted a ``connectingsection'' and resulted in a US demarche to the Soviets at the very timethe Department of State spokesman was inappropriately assuring CongressmanKemp and others who had raised questions about the Soviet's photos, that``we don't have any reason to doubt the authenticity of the SS-20 photographor any others.''</ITAG>[S13MY8-1437]{S5806}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Missiles and Launchers. </T3>Among the treaty's missile and launchernumber questions are the fact that while NATO has long held that therewere 441 SS-20 launchers, the Soviets said there were only 405. Similarly,the number of SS-20 missiles, including ``non-deployed'' missiles may beoff by anywhere from 50 to some 300 or 600 or more_a military very significantnumber. Other reported data problem include issues involving the SS-23launchers and missiles and the SS CX 4 ground-launched cruise missile.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1438]{S5806}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Unanswered Congressional Inquiries and Official Confusion. </T3>Specificdata concerns raised by Senators and Congressman, including Senator JesseHelms and Congressman Jack Kemp, have not been resolved by the Administration.However, the Department of State has publicly acknowledged data ``difficulties''during the rushed December summit negotiations. Its official spokesmanadmitted on January 6, 1988 that: ``We all do know that from day to daywe were dealing with different numbers, and we never had a chance in thatbusy period to figure out why the US always seemed to have different figures.''</ITAG>[S13MY8-1439]{S5806}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>US Estimates: Wide Ranges and Errors. </T3>Thus far, the Administration,at least the Department of State, has publicly taken the position thatnotwithstanding certain data difficulties, it can still ``see no informationor indication that there was any deception involved by the Soviets'' andthat ``in the end, the overall data provided to us by the Soviets fitswithin our intelligence community estimates.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, such public assertion mask the facts that serious Congressionalinquiries about relevent INF data have not been resolved by the Administrationand that data disputes reportedly continue within the US intelligence community.Clearly, the range in official US estimates apparently is very great, meaningthat our margin of error, and our related uncertainties and verificationlimitations must be very great as well. The intelligence community's acknowledgementsof these wide ranges of uncertainty and error will require careful considerationby the Congress.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1440]{S5806}6.<ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Soviet Deception. </T3>Past Soviet negotiation deceptions in the SALTarms control negotiations during the 1970s should make us extremely cautiousto rely on any INF data the Soviet Union provides us which we cannot independentlyverify <T3>before </T3>we sign on to any agreeent. Yet the treaty's data baseis to be updated 30 days <T3>after</T3> the treaty comes into force, i.e., <T3>after </T3>the US Congress and the US Government have given the treatytheir final approval and trust. At that time, we can surely expect a shorterdata list with lower numbers from the Soviets, with correspondingly fewersites and lower data base, for any future US inspections and validation.But by then it will be too late to remedy the situation.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1441]{S5806}7.<ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>The Future is Now.</T3> The treaty's data problems cannot be resolvedby placing hope in future inspections, as do Administration and Congressionaltreaty proponents. Promised inspections may be blocked or circumventedby the Soviets and effective inspections may never take place. The evidentdata problems therefore require resolution and substantial further assessmentand further negotiation well before ratification, if any confidence isto be placed in the treaty's data base.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1442]{S5806}C.

The treaty's ineffective verification</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are at least seven severe limitations to the INF treaty's verificationregime which mean that the proposed treaty cannot be effectively verified.The judgment of the proposed treaty's verifiability as being a ``4 on ascale of 10,'' attributed to former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency(ACDA) Director Kenneth Adelman, is probably close to the mark.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some of the INF treaty's verification problems might be reduced byimproving future US intelligence assets. Such an effort should be carefullyconsidered, but it would be an expensive and long term proposition. Suchimprovements will not help in the near future and, in any case, would stillnot be able to resolve numerous intractable problems of likely deceptiveor covert Soviet practices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The severe limitations evident in the INF treaty's verification regimeinclude the following:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1443]{S5807}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>US Estimates.</T3> US officials acknowledge that the US does not knowaccurately through its own intelligence how many spare missiles the Sovietsproduced, or where and how these might be sited. The reported estimatesrange widely and have a high margin of error. For Soviet SS-20 missilesproduced, for example, the officially acknowledged margin of error is atleast 50 percent beyond the 650 reported by the Soviets in the treaty'sdata base. This uncertainty involves some 300 and as many as 600 or moreSS-20 missiles with 900 to 1,800 or more warheads. (In terms of major militarysignificance, the number of warheads is many times as large as that ofthe US Pershing II missile force we are to eliminate and far larger thanNATO's total programmed INF deployment of 108 Pershing IIs and 464 GLCMs).</ITAG>[S13MY8-1444]{S5807}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Data Discrepancies.</T3> The data discrepancies described above alsorelate directly to our inability to monitor the treaty accurately. It becomesimpossible to monitor the treaty's provisions effectively if, as notedabove, we cannot have certain confidence in the data base provided by theSoviet Union for all treaty-limited items. Yet the Soviet data has differedsignificantly from our own estimates in important categories and has beenprovided by a Soviet government which has deceived the United States ondata in previous arms control negotiations.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1445]{S5807}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>No. US Support Site Challeng Inspections ``Anywhere, Anytime'' in theSoviet Union and Soviet ``Inspectors'' in the US._</T3>The treaty provideson-site inspection rights only for <T3>specified </T3>categories of treaty-limited systems and facilitiesfor specified times and according to specified procedures. This potentiallyinvolves several hundred sites. But the US will be limited in the numberand types of inspections per year and we will <T3>not</T3> be able to inspect ``anywhere, anytime'' any sites which arenot already on the specific and numerically limited list of categoriesof facilities specified in the Protocol on Inspections and the Memorandumof Understanding on Data. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The severe limitation on where, when and what we can actually inspectunder the treaty leaves virtually all of the Soviet Union permanently <T3>closed</T3> to US inspectors. In practice, the US will be forced torely largely on our intelligence satellites. But the Soviets are adoptat camouflage and deception and their country is extremely secretive andseveral times as large as ours. Futhermore, our satellites have previouslymissed, at least for long periods of time, much major Soviet military activitiesas the construction of the giant radar at Krasnoyarsk or the storage ofSSCX4 cruise missiles and launchers now said by the Soviets to be at abase in Latvia. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be noted that while the treaty presumes to be comprehensiveabout former missile sites, we cannot inspect any former site not listedby the Soviets in the treaty's Memorandum of Understanding. Moreover, thereis no indication in the treaty concerning possible inspection of sitesin Cuba associated with SS-4 missile deployments at the time of the Kennedy-Khrushchevagreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The US decision not to insist on ``anywhere, anytime'' challenge inspectionsresults from concerns about greatly intensified and warranted intelligenceefforts on the part of Soviet ``INF inspectors'' in the United States whowould be seeking sensitive information going well beyond any possible INFconcerns. But the proposed treaty will result in at least 200 such Sovietinspections coming to the United States in any case. Furthermore, seriousUS concerns about unwarranted Soviet intelligence efforts, a concern compoundedby major legal and fiscal limitations on US counterintelligence efforts,do not obviate the fact that by not having ``anywhere, anytime'' challengeinspections in the treaty, the United States foregoes a vital element indeterring and in protecting itself against Soviet cheating. </ITAG>[S13MY8-1446]{S5807}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>SS-20/SS-25 Similarities.</T3> The close relationship between the INF-bannedSS-20 INF missile and the permitted strategic SS-25 ICBM greatly complicatesthe treaty's verification. The Soviet Union's new mobile strategic missile,the SS-25 ICBM, now being deployed, including at former SS-20 base, hasa first stage essentially identical to and a second stage and launcher </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">very similar to the supposedly banned SS-20 missile. The verificationproblems will therefore be severe. We could well face a problem with moreserious military consequences than that of SALT II and the question ofSoviet possible deployment of operational SS-16 ICBMs, a banned missilevery similar to the SS-20's stages.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1447]{S5807}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Cruise-Missiles. </T3>We cannot accurately gauge cruise missile ranges,which means that the treaty's ban on cruise missiles within certain rangescan be circumvented by Soviet production and testing cruise missiles notovertly below or above, but near, the proscribed range limits. We alsocannot accurately gauge the differences, if any, between proscribed land-basedcruise missiles and permitted sea- or air-launched cruise missiles, thusleaving a wide path to Soviet production and possible covert deploymentof land-based cruise missiles and mass production of the sea- and air-launchedsystems to provide new INF capabilities.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1448]{S5807}6.<ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Definitional and Other Problems. </T3>Two detailed recent reports onthe proposed INF treaty describe a host of specific definitional and otherproblems which will greatly complicate future monitoring of the treaty'sprovisions. The first is the aforementioned report on ``The Treaty on Intermediate-rangeNuclear Weapons: Does it Decrease_or Increase_the Danger of Nuclear War?''prepared by the Minority Staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeeand circulated by Senator Jesse Helms on January 25, 1988. The second,is an ``Article-by-Article Review of the INF Treaty'' published by theAmerican Enterprise Institute on February 3, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The provisions of the INF treaty contain numerous definitional ambiguitiesinvolving capabilities, launchers, cannisters, shrouding, testing, transit,dismantling, firing to destruction and inspection procedures etc. Theseambiguities can be expected significantly to cloud the INF verificationpicture in the future, with a very serious carryover effect into the StrategicArms Reduction Treaty (START) now being rushed to completion for the US-Sovietsummit this May.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1449]{S5807}7.<ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>The Special Verification Commission. </T3>The poor record of the existingUS-Soviet Standing Consultative Commission for the ABM Treaty and SALTI in clarifying such issues and related disputes bodes ill for placingany hopes whatsoever in a similar ``Special Verification Commission'' tobe established under the INF Treaty.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1450]{S5807}D. The tre<ITAG tagnum="73">D. The treaty underouts NATO deterrence</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted above, the proposed INF treaty, though nominally reducingboth US and Soviet INF/SRINF missiles to zero, in fact has such seriousdata discrepancies and verification weakenesses that Soviet deception andcircumvention are entirely plausible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, as the US complies fully with the treaty and goes toward zero,we can have no assurance that the Soviets will fully comply with theirpart of the bargain any more than they have with the many previous treatiesthey have broken.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But even if the INF treaty's data base were accurate and trustworthy,verification effective, and full Soviet compliance certain, the treatywould still greatly weaken NATO's deterrence capabilities once our ownINF missiles are removed. The reasons include the following:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1451]{S5807}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>The loss of Unique Systems. </T3>The US would be giving up its mostcredible deterrent forces, the only US forces deployed in European countriesthat can rapidly (within 15 minutes for the Pershing II), and with veryhigh confidence, reach targets in Soviet territory from which Soviet attackscan be launched or supported. Our short-range systems would destroy chieflyallied or East European, rather than Soviet territory. Our aircraft areslower and would have to fly into heavily defended air space.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1452]{S5807}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Soviet Redundancy and Circumventions. </T3>In contrast with the UnitedStates, the Soviet Union does not suffer any net loss in rapid deliverycapability against European targets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviet Union can readily cover, with its great surplus of strategicmissiles, the regional targets previously covered by its INF missiles.The regional role of the Soviet SS-20 missiles can fairly readily be assumedby retargeting the surplus of new Soviet strategic missiles, includingthe SS-25 ICBM currently being deployed, or by the forthcoming new SS-24ICBM and the SS-18 follow-on ICBM. The potential INF role of the SS-25is made even easier by the close similarity between the banned SS-20 andthe permitted SS-25.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The United States, in contrast, because of its far smaller correspondingprompt hard-target capability against the huge number of Soviet hard targets(including some 1,400 ICBM silos and some 1,500 or more command-and-controlbunkers), has no surplus or strategic missiles that might be retargetedto handle regional targets if US INF missiles are removed.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1453]{S5807}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Response to Across-the-Board Soviet Deployments. </T3>NATO's nuclearforces traditionally are intended to deter a broad spectrum of forces inwhich the Soviets have substantial numerical advantages. NATO's 1979 decisionto deploy Pershing II and GLCM systems was not based solely (as is sometimesinaccurately believed today) on the requirement to help redress the Sovietdeployment of the SS-20 INF missile.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The new US INF deployments were in part to respond to the triple-warheadmobile SS-20 INF missiles the Soviets began to</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">deploy in late 1976 at the rate of a missile per week on a base of600 deployed Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 INF missiles (while the US had zero INFmissiles). But the Pershing IIs and GLCMs were also intended to respondto a wide range of other Soviet force deployments as well. These Sovietdeployments included nuclear, conventional and chemical forces and newsystems such as the Backfire bomber. That new deterrence requirement remainsfor NATO even if the SS-20 missiles go, but the requirement cannot be equallycredibly fulfilled by other NATO systems.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1454]{S5807}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Land-Basing, Coupling and Flexible Response.</T3> In 1979 NATO decidedto deploy its new Pershing II and GLCM INF systems on land, and their rolecannot be equaled with sea-based systems, for two major reasons. First,because the Allies, headed by Germany's Socialist Chancellor Helmut Schmidt,considered them a far more visible and direct aspect of US-NATO couplingthan sea-based systems. Second, since the launch of a sea-based theaterdeterrent such as US Polaris missiles assigned regionally to NATO cannotreadily be distinguished by the Soviets from a US strategic response, thesea-based systems are not as appropriate for NATO's ``flexible response''strategy and not as credible a deterrent as land-based systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These two factors remain true today, as testified to by former NATOComandant, General Bernard Rogers. As for air-launched systems, these arefired from more vulnerable platforms, are far slower (at least than thePershings) and must penetrate heavily defended Warsaw Pact air space.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1455]{S5808}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>The Article XIV Problem and Constraints on UK or French Modernization.</T3>The treaty requires in Article XIV that ``the Parties shall comply withthis Treaty and shall not assume any international obligations or undertakingswhich would conflict with its provisions.'' Yet such ``undertakings'' clearlyextend beyond the specific provisions of the treaty. US officials claimthat the Soviets no longer claim compensation for French and British (strategic)nuclear systems and they have optimistically asserted that this broad provisionwill not restrict standard US cooperation with our Allies on non-treaty-limitedsystems. However, Soviet officials are already complaining about Alliedmodernization efforts as being against the spirit of the proposed treaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets can be expected to invoke this far-reaching article withtelling political effect in the future to evoke support in Western anti-defensecircles for their likely interpretation of Article XIV as constrainingNATO/UK/French, and even FRG, modernization even though such modernizationconstraints may not be directly addressed in the INF treaty. </ITAG>[S13MY8-1456]{S5808}6.<ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>NATO Nuclear Modernization, the ``Montebello'' Problem and WishfulThinking. </T3>Treaty proponents appear to have great confidence that asUS INF forces and the German Pershing I shorter-range INF missile disappear,NATO will act programatically to implement its ``Montebello Decision''of 1983. They appear optimistic that NATO will finally agree on significantmodernization programs for NATO`s deterrent forces to include short-rangenuclear missiles (e.g. the follow-on to the 88 LANCE short-range missilesdeployed in Europe), dual capable aircraft, and nuclear artillery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These and other modern systems such as air- and sea-based cruise missileshave been discussed, as by NATO's Defense Ministers in Monterey, Californiain November 1987, as vital ``compensatory steps'' needed after an INF agreementto ensure a credible defense. In addition to nuclear force modernizationdiscussed at Montebello, Monterey and other NATO meetings, modern conventionaland chemical forces are also required by NATO to deter the far larger Sovietforces and in the absence of any effective verification or stabilizingreductions scenarios for those types of forces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Realistically speaking, there is much wishful thinking and self-deceptioninvolved in entrusting NATO's future security to what is closer to beinga Montebello ``Myth'' than a Montebello ``Decision'' on deploying compensatorynew NATO deterrent systems. Pressed by their Left, the European governments,and particularly the Germans have continued to balk at supporting follow-onLances, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ironically, the most successful part of the Montebello process thusfar has been the unilateral removal of some 1,400 US nuclear weapons andcharges from Europe since 1983 (which followed an earlier unilateral reductionof 1,000 nuclear weapons/charges after 1979). The Montebello process hasthus far certainly not assured the selection, financing or deployment ofmodern new NATO forces.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1457]{S5808}7.<ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>High Extra Costs_This will be an Very Expensive Treaty. </T3>Far fromsaving money, this will be a very expensive treaty. There is no NATO agreementon financing most of the Montebello modernization progress. There are noteven budgeted US funds for the large extra costs of dismantling the INFsystems as required by the treaty, or for the extra costs of implementingthe treaty's verification provisions and inspection procedures. There willbe huge costs to undertake conventional force improvements made more essentialby our INF drawdown. All of these costs are high_with hundreds of millions,indeed billions, of as yet unbudgeted dollars involved. Moreover it willbe impossible to recover the $6-7 billion dollar investment sunken intothe INF systems which are slated to go. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is an ungainsayable reality that there is painfully little evidenceof a desire by NATO's parliaments, specifically including our own US Congress,to come up with budgeted funds for the very substantial extra costs associatedwith the INF treaty. Furthermore, while ``budget sharing'' is a cry, andsometimes a scapegoat in the US on NATO defense issues, the political andparliamentary situations in Western Europe are likely to be exacerbatedrather than improved by US pressure on this matter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the growing fervor associated with the US-Soviet summitsand the hopes of genuine Soviet reform and a new East-West ``detente,''NATO's Montebello modernization situation is likely to deteriorate furtherwith each future NATO meeting and with each future defense budget votewithin Western Europe's parliaments. In addition, several candidate programsfor force modernization are encumbered by restrictions imposed by the USCongress, for either fiscal or other reasons, e.g. on the Army TacticalMissile System (ATACMS) and Tactical Air to Surface Missiles (TASM).</ITAG>[S13MY8-1458]{S5808}8.<ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Conventional Forces.</T3> All of the adverse considerations about theINF treaty's impact on deterrence and defense modernization apply not onlyto nuclear weapons, as under ``Montebello,'' but also, as noted above,to the required, but very expensive modernization of NATO's conventionalforces. This is an area in which force asymmetries favoring the SovietUnion are likely to increase and in which it has proved impossible thusfar to devise any arms reductions regime that is both stabilizing and verifiable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of the systems the INF treaty will not permit NATO to have, isthe conventionally armed land-based GLCM (which could be a suitable precision-guidedweapon and would have the advantage of being more readily dispersible thansea- or air-launched cruise missiles). However, there are fundamental verificationproblems associated with unarmed ``drone'' missiles (which are permittedunder the treaty), and sea- and air-launched cruise missiles of all ranges(which are permitted under the treaty). These problems not only greatlyreduce the arms control utility of the treaty's GLCM restriction, but maywell enable the Soviet Union to develop and deploy GLCMs covertly on aunilateral basis if they so choose while we deny ourselves that right.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1459]{S5808}9.<ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Soviet Arms Control Proposals and Nuclear/CW Free Zones.</T3> Growingdomestic political pressures from Socialist and Green parties in Europe_aswell as heavy diplomatic pressure from the Soviet Union, including Sovietproposals for nuclear and chemical weapons (CW) free zones (which willeliminate required US deterrents but not have assured verification andcompliance on the Soviet side)_will further reduce the likelihood of gainingappropriate NATO force modernization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In West Germany, in particular, pressures for denuclearisation andneutralism are clearly gaining major new momentum from the proposed INFagreement. So are leftist opposition to NATO force modernization and supportfor ``free zones'' which would remove US forces across the Atlantic whileSoviet forces would move only several hundred miles East, within closerange of Western Europe. Since mid-1987, when the Federal Republic of Germany's(FRG) government first felt strong pressures to throw its Pershing Is shorter-rangeINF missiles into the super-powers' INF agreement, the Germans have feltthemselves to be an undesirably ``singularized'' NATO state with regardto the stationing of remaining nuclear shorter-range systems. This adversesituation is being very strongly exploited by the FRG's Socialist (SPD),Liberal (FDP) and Green parties to block force modernization and to endorseunsound Soviet arms control proposals.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1460]{S5808}10.<ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>NATO Commanders on the Future.</T3> Two former recent US commandersof NATO, generals Alexander Haig and Bernard Rogers have warned of thedeleterious military consequences of removing the US INF missiles and ofnot providing corresponding fiscal and political resources to modernizeNATO forces. The incumbent, General John Galvin, has stated that substantialadditional funds must be spent in the wake of an INF agreement and thatif they are not provided, we will be in an increasingly dangerous situationfollowing US INF dismantlements. Regrettably, all three generals, as wellas over one thousand other concerned former senior military officers whorecently petitoned the President on this issue, are likely to be provenright in their pessimistic predictions.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1461]{S5808}VI_MORE ON<ITAG tagnum="89">VI_MORE ON THE PRESENT DANGER_THE INF TREATY IN ITS BROADER CONTEXT</ITAG>[S13MY8-1462]{S5808}<ITAG tagnum="21">In the rush of summit fever, INF treaty proponents are doing all theycan to divorce consideration of the substance of the proposed INF treatyfrom the broader context of US policy on arms control negotiations, Sovietbehavior and US-Soviet relations in which the treaty is being advanced.Such an unintegrated and shortsighted approach contributes new illusionsand dangers and makes America vulnerable to repeating past mistakes_butthis time with even more serious and tragic consequences than in the past.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unless this dangerous situation is fully exposed and reversed, seriousCongressional misjudgements and Executive Department concessions and risksare likely to be compounded as we near the next summit meeting in Moscowthis May.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1463]{S5808}A. The INF<ITAG tagnum="73">A. The INF-summit package and the treaty's linkage to broader issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of major interrelated issues must be considered togetheron an integrated basis at US-Soviet summit meetings and in the intensiveprepatory ministerial meetings which precede the summits. In recent summits,for example, the US-Soviet agenda has included four major areas: arms control,regional issues, human rights, and other bilateral issues including exchangesprograms and trade.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Individually and collectively, such a wide range of issues are currentlythe subject of Administration analysis and policy options in the NationalSecurity Council and elsewhere as Secretary of State Shultz and SovietForeign Minister Shevardnadza work on their monthly rounds of ministerialmeetings prior to the May summit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is clearly essential that during the INF ratification debate theCongress should adopt an integrated approach parallel to that of the ExecutiveBranch. These broader US-Soviet issues must no more be divorced from integratedconsideration during serious Congressional review of the INF treaty thanthey should be divorced during Executive Branch preparation for summitmeetings. They need to be linked as well to a coherent longer-term strategytoward the Soviet Union.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, not only the specific concerns and recommendations concerningthe INF treaty, but also such broader issues, should be reflected in safeguardingamendments, reservations or conditions to be attached to the proposed treatyas part of the ratification process.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1464]{S5809}B. Some cr<ITAG tagnum="73">B. Some critical broader issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Along with the fundamental flaws in the INF treaty's provisions andits dangers for NATO deterrence, broader issues to be considered as partof the INF treaty-summit package should include the following:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1465]{S5809}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>The Continuing Soviet Military Buildup. </T3>Two just-released annualreports to the Congress prepared by the Secreaty of Defense and by theJoint Chiefs of Staff_like the Defense Department's detailed annual assessmentsof ``Soviet Military Power''_vividly demonstrate that while the UnitedStates is in its fourth year of declining defense investment and is currentlybeing forced by Congressional restrictions to undertake substantial forcecuts, the Soviet military buildup continues across the board at a veryhigh pace with force deployments far greater than ours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As enumerated in the Pentagon's official reports, the unwarrantedSoviet military buildup extends far beyond any plausible Soviet defensiveneeds. It follows the huge unilateral Soviet buildups of the 1970's ``detente''period and includes offensive and defensive as well as central, regionaland force projection systems. Unhindered by fiscal or environmentalistconstraints, many of the new Soviet weapons systems are highly mobile (asthe new rail/road based SS-25 and SS-24 ICBMs), a deployment mode whichclearly enhances their survivability and their adaptability for camouflageand for covert deployment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding Mikhail Gorbachev's words, the Soviet deploymentsgo on and on. As summarized in a January 19, 1987 speech by CIA Deputy,Robert Gates: ``Despite Soviet rhetoric, we still see no lessening theirweapons production. . . . Virtually all of the principal strategic weaponswill be replaced with new, more sophisticated systems by the mid-1990s,and a new bomber is being added * * *.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to its continuing strategic force buildup, the SovietUnion's naval, aircraft and armor buildups are perhaps best known. Butas detailed in the Defense Department's November 1987 report on ``The SovietSpace Challenge,'' the Soviet Union is also going all out to dominate space.The Pentagon report makes clear that while the Soviet leaders are pushingU.S. negotiators and the U.S. Congress to kill the U.S. SDI program, andare claiming to be opposed to ``the militarization of space,'' the Sovietmilitary buildup includes a massive effort, far beyond the relatively modestU.S. SDI program, to achieve Soviet war-fighting dominance in space-basedoffensive and defensive systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As reported by the Defense Department, the Soviet effort is clearlyproducing a widening and dangerous gap between Soviet and U.S. effortsin this area. It should be clear that he who controls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">space would also control earth, as is the Soviet Union's intention.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1466]{S5809}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Soviet Military Doctrine and Strategic Deception.</T3> The Soviet militarybuildup combines with Soviet doctrines which stress surprise, attack, deceptionand victory. Under Mikhail Gorbachev_as in his book <T3>Perestroika</T3>_Soviet leaders have continued their strong affirmationof the Brezhnev Doctrine on maintaining Soviet military/political dominanceagainst ``anti-socialist'' deviations among Soviet allies while vigorouslydirecting and bankrolling pro-Soviet forces in wars of ``national liberation''directed against the Western democracies around the globe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These factors, and others such as construction of some 1,500 or moreSoviet command and control bunkers, deep tunneling activity and force projectionexpansion as described in the Defense Department's reports on ``SovietMilitary Power,'' give the lie to current major Soviet strategic deceptionefforts on supposed ``new'' defensive-oriented Soviet military doctrines,on a less militarily-focused Soviet economy and on global ``openness''and ``peaceful competition.'' On the contrary, current Soviet militaryprograms indicate that the Soviet leaders in practice reject the MutualAssured Destruction (MAD) doctrine which still governs US deterrence, andthat they in fact believe that they can prevail in a nuclear war and inan intensification of the global struggle against the United States andthe other democracies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ongoing Soviet military programs described publicly by the DefenseDepartment and by US intelligence officials clearly demonstrate an increased,rather than decreased Soviet drive to achieve military dominance, and touse Soviet and Soviet proxy forces to subvert and blackmail other nationsor to prevail in all possible military conflicts throughout the globe andincluding space. These Soviet programs and practices must surely be takenfully into account in considering any reduction in US deterrent forcesand in placing trust in any new arms control agreements with the SovietUnion_whether involving INF, START, strategic defense, nuclear testing,conventional or chemical forces.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1467]{S5809}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Soviet Aggression and Arms Control Disinformation; Congressional Constraintson Freedom Fighters; and US Diplomatic Concessions</T3> must also be fullytaken into account in their dangerous cumulative impact on the INF-Summitpackage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Soviet Aggression.</T3> As the proposed INF treaty is being consideredby the Congress, Soviet troops and those of its militant allies such asCuba, Vietnam and Nicaragua continue to wage war in a large number of countriesincluding Afghanistan, Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, El Salvador,Cambodia </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">and Laos. Soviet-directed and bankrolled subversion, terrorism anddisinformation continues apace throughout the globe. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Regrettably, US Government reports detailing these aggressive Sovietactivities are little noted in the Congress and the media, although theyoffer essential material for the current debate on the linkage betweenINF treaty considerations, Soviet behavior and US-Soviet relations. Theofficial US reports include the cited Defense Department reports and otherdetailed official reports on Cuban/Sandinista activities in Central America,Soviet warfare in Afghanistan, and intensified Soviet disinformation activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Soviet arms control disinformation</T3> activities_include a broadrange of high priority Soviet arms control efforts focused on unilaterialist``peace'' and church groups. These Soviet activities have been describedin several Congressional reports and have been detailed in a recent Departmentof State publication ``Soviet Influence Activities: A Report on ActiveMeasures and Propaganda, 1986-7.'' In this regard, the Defense Department'sannual publication on ``Soviet Military Power'' has also outlined the special``maskirova'' (deception) role of the ``Directorate of Strategic Deception''established at the beginning of the SALT I negotiations in 1969 at seniorlevels of the Soviet General Staff under General Nikolai Ogarkov. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Congressional Constraints on Freedom Fighters.</T3> As part of a continuingpressure for further US retrenchment in the face of threatening Sovietactivity, cuts imposed by the leaders of the Democrat majority in the Congresshave critically undercut our government's ability to assist freedom fightersto resist Soviet-sponsored warfare and subversion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>US Diplomatic Concessions on Regional Conflicts.</T3> At the same time,no doubt under pressure both of Congressional restrictions and summit fever,US diplomacy leaning in the Soviet Union's direction on regional issueshas gone into high gear as the INF treaty is before the Senate. In thissituation, the Department of State, in particular, is reportedly pressingtoward major concessions in US agreements with the Soviet Union or theSoviets' Communist clients in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, Mozambique,and, perhaps Cambodia. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These agreements would asymetrically cut off US military assistanceto those fighting Soviet-inspired aggression and dictatorships in exchangefor Soviet/Sandinista promises for future compliance on Soviet troop removal,Sandinista democratization, etc. etc. Similarly, in the Middle-East, theDepartment of State is pressing Israel to make major territorial and politicalconcessions preceding negotiations and is seeking to reverse four decadesof US opposition to an international peace conference including the SovietUnion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the Congress has focused on the INF treaty aspects of currentUS-Soviet summit preparations, the very important and interrelated elementsof aggressive Soviet behavior and weakened US diplomatic and security policydescribed above have been largely brushed aside by treaty supporters. However,the fact that these elements are part of the overall INF-Summit packageand that they involve proposed deals with significant diplomatic, militaryand ethical asymetries must cause such proposed deals to be the subjectof closest scrutiny and critique by the Congress as part of the INF treatyratification review.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1468]{S5809}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. INF, START, and Restricting/Delaying SDI. SDI is directly endangeredby current deals involving INF and emerging on START and Defense and Spacenegotiations. A pre-ratification political deal on INF between the Administrationand Democratic Senators appears to involve a US commitment to a ``narrow''interpretation of the ABM Treaty. The START and Defense negotiations haveinvolved consideration of a US commitment to the ABM Treaty of 7-10 moreyears.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such deals on SDI are emerging even though the ABM Treaty has longago been broken by Soviet violations and in spite of increasing evidenceof Soviet preparations for a full scale breakout. Caught by summit feverand unsound arms control pressures, the United States now risks delayingor constraining the accelerated phased deployment of our best defense insurancepolicy_SDI, thereby fulfilling the Soviet Union's highest arms controlnegotiation priority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commenting on the clear Soviet objective of paralysing the US SDIprogram while accelerating Soviet strategic defense programs, former Secretaryof Defense Casper Weinberger stated last November 21 (in a letter to CongressmanJack Kemp): ``the thrust of the Soviet proposal is to impose artificialconstraints on SDI that will prevent us from developing and deploying strategicdefenses. . . . (and their proposal on testing paramaters) contains manyloopholes and is unverifiable.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On these issues, the INF-Summit package, START and SDI are directlyintertwined in their risks and must be addressed as such. A prudent STARTagreement may not be ready on its own terms because of inherent major problems(involving data base, verification, modernization, mobile systems, SLCMs,etc.), and would therefore be dangerous to conclude in a rush at the nextsummit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But at least as important as the emerging START agreement's flaws,is the connection between START and SDI. Postponing initial SDI deploymentsfor 7-10 years, as currently contemplated in the context of START or ofa new treaty involving strategic defenses, would be an extremely high andunacceptably dangerous US price to pay for any ``arms control'' treaty_whether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">involving INF, START or strategic defense. Regretably, few Americansas yet realise that this is a price which is, in fact, becoming an integralcomponent of the INF and START treaty packages and of our nation's emergingarms control framework being presented to the Congress as the US approachesthe summit meeting in Moscow this May.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1469]{S5810}5.<ITAG tagnum="21">5.<T3> Bailing Out the Soviet Economy Again.</T3> With summit fever and theaura of a new ``detente,'' pressure is increasing for providing furthergenerous US credits, advanced technology and a wide range of new jointcommercial ventures to the Soviet Union.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Currently, such US credits to the Soviet Union are subsidized by UStaxpayers at rates (about 7%) well below commercial rates we would haveto pay and at a high volume of some $24 billion a year, of which some $18billion a year is provided as ``untied'' loans not linked to any specificpurpose. US taxpayers' money provides a very significant proportion ofthe Soviet Union's annual hard currency earnings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets are now also entering Western bond markets, thus competingfor funds and raising interest rates. There has even been discussion aboutthe US granting the Soviet Union Most Favored Nation (MFN) status, in spiteof the fact that US officials have in the past recognized the linkage betweenconsideration of such status and the Helsinki Accords human rights obligations,which the Soviets have consistently violated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The generous monies we provide to the Soviet Union, as well as theincreasing flow of advanced US technology clearly help the Soviet leadersavoid having to undertake fundamental reforms for their ailing economyand are instead likely to be used by the Soviets to fuel their continuedmilitary buildup. Our hard currency subsidization of the Soviet Union greatlyhelps the Soviets to bankroll its proxy forces to subvert and fight againtthe cause of freedom throughout the globe. (The Soviet Union, for example,supports Cuba at the rate of $5 billion a year and Nicaragua at some $2-3million a day.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the rush of summitry and to ``Detente II,'' the process of US taxpayersand businesses subsidizing the Soviet Union is picking up steam, especiallyin the Commerce and State Departments. The Defense Department's role inscrutinizing such deals and transfers from a security viewpoint is reportedlyunder increasing bureaucratic siege. As part of its review of the INF-SummitPackage Congress should investigate and reverse these dangerous developments.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1470]{S5810}CONCLUSION<ITAG tagnum="89">CONCLUSION: THE NEED FOR A NATIONAL DEBATE AND A CHANGED COURSE</ITAG>[S13MY8-1471]{S5810}<ITAG tagnum="21">As the Senate ratification debate proceeds and as preparations intensifyfor the US-Soviet summit meeting in Moscow this spring, the Congressionaland national debate must focus on the major elements of the emerging INF-Summitpackage.

Mr. President, on Sunday, May 8, 1988, <T3>the New York Times </T3>published an article about the historic narrowgauge railroads in my home State of Colorado. This article was writtenby a Colorandan, author Dyan Zaslowsky, and captures the rich history ofthe railroads and the era in which they were built. The settlement of the Western United States was accomplished by the willof a nation and the hands of men. One of the greatest and few remainingsymbols of that determination and that excruciating work are the railroadlines that were built across the Great Plains, through the Rocky Mountainsand Sierra Nevadas, and on to the West Coast. The railroads of the West were essential to the mining operations thatfueled the settlement of States such as Colorado. Fortunately, severalof the narrow gauge lines that made passage through Colorado's steep andcurvaceous mountains possible remain operational, and today provide wonderfulrecreation opportunities for tens of thousands of tourists to my State.I want to share these adventures with my colleagues in the Senate, andurge them to join us in Colorado. We can all enjoy this wonderful Americanheritage! All Aboard. I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred to be printedin the <T4>Record. </T4>There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows: [S13MY8-1489]{S5811}[From the <ITAG tagnum="71">[From the New York Times, May 8, 1988] </ITAG>[S13MY8-1490]{S5811}TheRockie<ITAG tagnum="74">The Rockies by Narrow Gauge Rail </ITAG>[S13MY8-1491]{S5811}coloradoa<ITAG tagnum="89">colorado and new mexico's railroads provide a scenic link to the miningera of the 19th century </ITAG>[S13MY8-1492]{S5811}(By Dyan Z<ITAG tagnum="71">(By Dyan Zaslowsky) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Between 1870 and the early 1890's optimism about Colorado, embodiedin discoveries of gold but mostly of silver, crested in the Rockies andconverged with the other national sensation of the era, the steam-drivennarrow gauge railroad. Along with their precious ore the trains carried``the emotional treasure of a westering people,'' wrote Lucius Beebe, theextravagant chronicler of Colorado's railroads. A sentimental attachmentpersists, as every summer and fall thousands ride a smattering of old trainsreorganized into excursion railroads: the Cumbres andamp; Toltec Scenic Railroad,the Durango andamp; Silverton Narrow Gauge, the Georgetown Loop Railroadand the Cripple Creek andamp; Victor Narrow Gauge Railroad, to name at leastfour. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My husband and I prefer to explore the backcountry on foot, but lastJuly, accompanied by one or the other of our two daughters, I decided toride three of the lines through the mountains. Traveling at about 12 milesan hour they are one of the slowest ways to cover Colorado's high country.The trains penetrate areas not reachable by car, lurching and creekingon their crinkum-crankum way, exhaling mildly sulfurous smoke and speakingin guttural whistles. Every ride offers opportunities to appreciate nature'shandwork and that of the men who built the railroads and tamed the mountains.Or, at least, who boasted that they did. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Operating on tracks placed about 20 inches closer together than standardgauge railroads, narrow gauge railroads were cheaper to build in the mountainsand could negotiate steep grades and sharp curves more easily. The littletrains proliferated with the mining claims. They brought people and suppliesinto the remotest camps and hauled ore out. Nearly every mining town hadits own railroad, and sometimes two, financed on the strength of nimbleassurances and the sudden flash of precious metal in a rocky seam. Visionsof what was possible were so grand that management of the Denver andamp;Rio Grande Railway (later the Denver andamp; Rio Grande Western) announcedin 1870 that its ultimate terminus would be Mexico City. In anticipationof that day the railroad borrowed the word Toltec from the Nahuatl Indiansin Mexico and used it to name its line over Cumbres pass. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unforseen costs and the failure of mining claims to live up to expectationsfractured the dream of a viable rail network through the mountains. Andthen it didn't matter anyway. Congress repealed the Sherman Silver PurchaseAct in 1893, replacing the country's silver and gold monetary standardwith a single one based on gold. The value of Colorado's silver mines plummeted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Beebe in his book ``Narrow Gauge Railroads of the Rockies'' saidthat by that time, however, ``The most opulent sarabands and lushest folkways,all the properties that made 19th-century Colorado an envy and wondermentto less fortunate parts of the world, took passage in one way or anotheraboard steam cars, most of them riding on rails laid just three feet apart.''Before the fury subsided, more than 2,000 miles of narrow gauge track hadbeen laid in Colorado and New Mexico. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The remaining railroads operate on fewer than 120 miles of originalroadbed, with the Cumbres andamp; Toltec consuming 64 miles of it. The C.andamp; T.S.R., formerly a portion of the Denver andamp; Rio Grande, is nowjointly owned by Colorado and New Mexico. It crosses the border of thetwo states 12 times between its tiny stations at Antonito, Colo., and Chama,N.M. Antionito, a town of 1,100, lies at the southern end of the long,broad San Luis Valley. It is a bland little town that seems oblivious tothe train's attraction; like the rest of the valley, its chief interestsare agricultural. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We had driven through Antonito many times on our way to Santa Fe,two hours to the south. The immediate surroundings are so level and plainthat it is hard to believe that wild country lies beyond several gentlehills, just out of sight of passing automobiles. But the Cumbres andamp;Toltec reveals many surprises. I rode the 10 A.M. train out of Antonitowith my 9-month-old daughter in her car seat facing me. The dark olivetrain_reconstructed from old freight cars_has been modernized insofar asthere are toilets and a snack bar. Its mustard-colored interior is spare,but the seats are comfortable and the aisles roomier than I expected. Pullingaway from Antonito, the train ascended a wide curve through stark, opencountry that looks New Mexican rather than Coloradan. PinandCx.174;6on pinetrees and junipers dapple the dry hills, and the most visible geographicallandmark is 10,908-foot San Antonio Peak to the southwest. The peak, anextinct volcano, is smooth and round, and looks like an overturned bowl.The Sangre de Cristo Range fades farther into the blue distance, and throughthe open window I could smell pungent sagebrush. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subtly, the landscape changed. Stands of ponderosa pines and aspensreplaced the pinandCx.174;6ons and junipers. The train rose above the valleyfloor, past the ruler-edged mesas and into the jagged canyons of the lowerSan Juans. At Sublette, N.M., 9,200 feet in elevation, the train stoppedto take on water, and passengers got off to walk through the town's abandonedapricot-colored buildings. After leaving Sublette, the scenery flippedvertically. About 600 feet below the ledge of track ran the Los PinandCx.174;6osRiver, and while a cabin here and there was visible, there were no roadsand few signs of human habitation. It is an area in which some passengersget off to go backpacking, if arrangements are made in advance with theconductor.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ride became more  exciting as the train rounded Phantom Curve,named for its weirdly shaped pinnacles and the impression they create atnight, when the moon and the steam engine's headlight shine on them. Onthe C. andamp; T.S.R. line are two narrow gauge tunnels more than 300 feetlong, one of mud and timbers, the other blasted out of rock. The railroadsdidn't build many tunnels, preferring to go miles around an obstacle ratherthan several hundred feet through it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At Osier, the site of an old depot, the Chama train met the Antonitotrain and switched engines, while passengers got off to have a picnic orbuy a hot lunch at the restaurant in the former eating house for railroadworkers, which was built in 1885. After lunch, which we ate on the trainbecause a cold drizzle was falling,  the train reached its highest pointat the 10,015-foot Cumbres Pass, before starting down a 4 percent gradethat ended in Chama, 2,500 feet lower. The trip to Chama took five hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many people starting from either end go as far as Osier and then returnto their departure point. Those wanting to go all the way to Chama cantake a van back to Antonito the same day, which adds only an hour of travelingtime. Or, they can stay overnight in Chama and ride the train back to Antonitothe next day.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Chama is not much more appealing than Antonito as a place to linger,but such places are a more realistic depiction of what life in the backwashof the American West was like a century ago, and, beyond the tourist centers,still is.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Better known for their charm and their narrow gauge train are Durangoand Silverton. Durango, a bustling city of 11,500, has renovated the areaaround the railroad station. Attractive restaurants and restored Victorianhotels overlook the train, and the aroma from the McDonald's at the stationmingles with the smell of coal smoke. To a lesser extent, Silverton, whichlies at 9,288 feet in a valley cupped by 13,000-foot peaks, has exploitedits heritage in mining. Mining still employs a fraction of the town's 800residents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Silverton's reputation was made by Otto Mears, a Russian Jewish immigrantwho was one of Colorado's most adventurous railroad builders, sprawningthree separate lines from the single town. Known as the ``pathfinder ofthe San Juan,'' Mears handed out gold and silver railroad passes to preferredpassengers and reputedly spoke the Ute Indian language with a Yiddish accentin treaty negotiations. The D. andamp; R.G. eventually acquired Mears's Silvertonrailroad, and in 1981 the Denver andamp; Rio Grande Western sold the Silvertonbranch to Charles E. Bradshaw Jr., a rail fan and Florida citrus grower.Each summer and fall steam passenger service grows, but the railroad stillhauls freight. The bright amber Durango  andamp; Silverton cars have beenhandsomely restored with original oak and ash interiors intact. From ceilingssprout antique light fixtures, now electrified. A few cars retain theiroriginal seats, although most have been fitted with roomy seats from oldbuses. A parlor car, which serves liquor, can  be reserved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ride between Durango and Silverton takes about three hours. Ifyou start from the Silverton end, as my 5-year-old daughter and I did onebright Sunday afternoon, the scenery quickly becomes breathtaking. Theride begins in a meadow on track paralleling the Animas River, and here,on the west side of the Continental Divide, vegetation is much more lushthan on the east side.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Particularly on summer weekends the train bulges with backpackersand river runners, who ride to one of three points along the way, disembarkand head for the river or for the Weminuche Wilderness Area for a few days.The Weminuche hugs an 80-mile stretch of the Continental Divide and isColorado's largest roadless area. The train does not enter the protectedwilderness but continues to thread its way through jagged canyons, comingwithin inches of trees and rocky walls.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">About half way through the trip the D. andamp; S.N.G. climbs up a shelfof track blasted out of red granite, a sheer 400 feet about the AnimasRiver. Squeezed through the confines of the tight canyon, the river churnswhite, and has officially been rated unnavigable in this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The train creeps over a wrought-iron truss bridge 130 feet long firstbuilt over the Animas in 1880 and rebuilt in 1981. Gradually, the scenery,while still beautiful, grows more tame. Human encroachment along the Durangoandamp; Silverton is more pronounced than on the Cumbres andamp; Toltec line,as the train passes several private homes and resorts. Roads reappear,and in one stretch the train parallels U.S. 550. Nostalgia and adventuredissolve in the modern elixir of town houses, mobile home parks, yardswith pink flamingoes and a billboard for the Cowboy Chapter of ChristianAthletes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Georgetown Loop Railroad, 50 miles west of Denver on Interstate70, is a satisfying snippet of narrow gauge railroading for those who cannotgo as far as Antonito or Durango. The three-and-a-half miles of track runthrough pine and aspen woods in the Georgetown and Silver Plume NationalHistoric District. The round trip, which must be reserved, takes abouttwo and a half hours and includes an optional tour of the defunct LebanonMine, 360 feet below the interstate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the Colorado Central Railroad built the Georgetown narrow gaugein 1877, it encountered_and overcame_one of Colorado railroading's frequentchallenges. Narrow gauge locomotives could climb no more than a 4 percentgrade, but the rise from Georgetown to Silver Plume two miles away wasa steady 6 percent. To solve the problem, a Union Pacific Railroad engineerdesigned a large iron loop, permitting the train to cross over itself ona 300-foot trestle 100 feet above Clear Creek. This loop, which cost about$250,000 to build originally, was rebuilt in 1982 for $1 million.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Brief as the Georgetown trip is, it is a concentrated dose of narrowgauge nostalgia, particularly on a late afternoon train out of Silver Plume.Old Engine 40 burns oil rather than coal because it was originally builtin the United States for service in El Salvador, where there were no coalsupplies. Having pulled as many as six round trips a day, the engine submitsto a sanding of its flues, which forces out the uncombusted fuel that wouldotherwise clog its pipes. On the steepest part of the straightaway, whilethe engine goes full out and bellows with the rhythmic thrust of all itswork, a pillar of jet black smoke bursts from its smokestack. Passengersin open cars head for covered ones to miss being blanketed by the fallinggrime, the dusky perfume of their trip into the past.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1493]{S5812}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1494]{S5812}MEASURES P<ITAG tagnum="81">MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR</ITAG>The following bill, previously received from the House of Representatives,was read the first and second times by unanimous consent, and placed onthe calendar:[S13MY8-1495]{S5812}4262.<ITAG tagnum="21">H.R. 4262.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill tocorrect a feature in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that I am sure my colleagueswill understand and support. This proposal will change the passive losslimitation, so that it would not apply to deductions allowable for cashout-of-pocket expenses for taxes, interest, and trade or business expensesin connection with rental real estate investments.The passive loss limitations were an integral part of the Tax Reform Act'sobjective of closing tax shelters and generating a horizontal equity acrossall kinds of investments and among persons with similar incomes. I think,however, it is now clear that in the case of real estate investments wedid not actually achieve that objective because so much of rental realestate is not incorporated in such a way as to capture costs of investmentand operations internally.Real estate investments are always debt financed to a significant degree,held for very long investment purposes, heavily taxed by units of localgovernment, and very often owned by partnerships or small family corporationsthat have elected to be taxed on the individual schedules. It is true thatreal estate used to be a great tax shelter because depreciation of thetotal value of the property could be carried against earned income fromother sources and the most significant part of the investment, its capitalappreciation, would be deferred into the distant future and then taxedat a special capital gains rate. Mr. President, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 took care of the depreciationexpense deduction and the capital gains deferral arguments of those whofavored the capital loss limitations. I do not agree with their logic aboutcapital gains_I still am working to restore a lower rate of tax for capitalassets_but I believe a genuine injustice has been created by excludingreal, hard cash payments and expenses of operating rental real estate propertiesas a deduction to those investors who nevertheless must recognize the rentalincome as current income for tax purposes.Owners of real property must pay property taxes every year. They must payinterest on their mortgages every month. They must pay maintenance costs,usually under the duress of local building code and health code ordinancesif they don't. This is hard, cold, out-of-pocket money. How can we in Congresssay, on the one hand, that the rental receipts are income and the taxes,interest, and maintenance costs are not expenses directly related to earningthat income?It is not even a ``passive income'' inasmuch as a building manager, oran active partner in a real estate partnership, is going to pay those costsout of the acutal cash collected from tenants, and disburse only the residualto the limited partners or those who are not directly emptying the trash,mowing the lawns, or supervising the repairmen. A real estate investoris in the same position as a stockholder in General Motors or IBM. Themanagers of those entities can deduct their interest expenses, taxes, andoperating costs before paying dividends from earnings. Why shouldn't thereal estate investor be given horizontal equity with investors in financialassets?Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this bill, which is sponsoredin the House of Representatives by Mr. <T4>Pickle</T4> of the Ways and Means Committee. I am sure the merits ofthis proposal far outweigh any revenue consequences and we should considersuch measures on their economic merits, not on the basis of supposed revenueneeds in all those other areas where the Congress has overspent and thushas driven up the deficit.andCx.1;<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. MOYNIHAN:</ITAG>S. 2389.

I proudly join my distinguished colleague inthe House, Charles B. Rangel, (H.R. 4121) in sponsoring legislation tocorrect the lamentable condition of the Grange_an historic landmark anda tremendous source of community pride.The Grange, built in 1801, was the home of Alexander Hamilton, our nation'sfirst Secretary of the Treasury. September 1989 will mark the 200th anniversaryof Hamilton's appointment to this post. What better way to pay tributeto Hamilton's innumerable contributions to this nation than to assure thatthe Grange be preserved in his honor?The Hamilton Grange National Memorial was established in 1962 under PublicLaw 87-438 (76 Stat. 57). The legislation stipulated that the buildingmust be relocated before renovation could begin. No suitable site has sincebeen acquired. Therefore, I am proposing legislation to delete the relocationrequirement, and authorize the acquisition of the land on which the Grangeis presently located and the immediate renovation of the building and grounds.I share the hope of many Americans that the restoration of the only nationalmemorial to Alexander Hamilton could be well under way by September 1989.I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation and to supportits expeditious enactment.Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record,</T4> as follows: [S13MY8-1571]{S5817}S. 2389 <ITAG tagnum="71">S. 2389 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Be in enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UnitedStates of America in Congress assembled,</T3> That the Act of April 27,1962 (76 Stat. 57), is amended_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) in the first section, by striking the second sentence and inserting``The Secretary is authorized for the purpose of establishing such nationalmemorial to acquire lands, interests in lands, and improvements by donation,purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislationwhich would allow information contained in license applications for exportof commodities to foreign countries to be accessed under the Freedom ofInformation Act. This legislation specifically provides that the names and addresses oflicensed exporters, a general description of commodities exported, andthe countries of ultimate destination are not ``confidential'' as definedin the Export Administration Act, 50 United States Code App. section 2411(c)(1).As a result, this information would be subject to disclosure under section552 of title 5, United States Code; the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. President, there has long been a question as to the degree of confidentialitywhich should be allotted to the information contained in an exporter'slicense application. On one side of the issue it is argued that identificationof license holders by countries of export destination could cause companiesto be scrutinized or even harassed as a result of their export activities.It is further argued that release of license application information couldnotify competitors of trade opportunities, thereby hindering United Statescompanies international competitiveness. Conversely, those supporting expansion of available information under theFreedom of Information Act contend that any criticism or debate over exportpolicies of a particular company is the cost of conducting business ina country, such as the United States, which prides itself on free speechand self government. In response to the argument that competitors wouldgain an edge if this information were made available, proponents favoringaccess to these facts respond that similar information has been publishedby the Department of Commerce for many years. They contend that competitorscould easily discover trade opportunities from information which is alreadypublished, and therefore, no additional opportunities will be presentedby publishing an exporter's identity. Mr. President, I introduce this legislation today in anticipation of holdinghearings on this matter. It is my intent to bring the issue to light andinitiate a productive discussion. It may be that making this kind of informationavailable is not feasible for some reason or another, yet by bringing theissue to the attention of my colleagues and beginning a public debate,it is my belief that progress toward reaching a possible solution can bemade.andCx.1;<ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. SYMMS (for himself and Mr. <T4>McClure</T4>):</ITAG>S. 2391.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the senior Senator fromIdaho, Senator <T4>McClure,</T4> I am pleased to offer this bill adding U.S. 95 from Eastportto Homedale, ID, to the list of priority highway projects included in theFederal-aid Highway Act of 1987. As the ranking Republican on the Environmentand Public Works Subcommittee on Water Resources, Transportation, and Infrastructure,I will urge my colleagues on the committee to move this bill expeditiouslyso it may be approved by the Senate and considered in the House prior tothe adjournment of the 100th Congress.Passage of the bill will give the State of Idaho access to all of its annualapportionment of Federal-aid highway funds, except the interstate constructionand critical bridge funds, for construction and maintenance projects onU.S. 95 from Eastport to Homedale, ID. Without priority project statusfor U.S. 95, the Idaho Transportation Department has access only to primaryhighway funds and a small percentage of Interstate 4R funds for work onthe only highway connecting the Idaho panhandle region with the State capitaland the State's southeastern agricultural production centers.Kermit Kiebert, the director of the Idaho Transportation Department, recentlywrote to me requesting priority project status for this very importantIdaho highway. Director Kiebert noted that nearly every witness testifyingat a recent forum on the future of Idaho surface transportation focusedon U.S.  95 as the most important transportation facility in Idaho. Asnoted in my own written testimony at the Idaho transportation forum, Istrongly support the State's efforts to expand and improve that vital north-southhighway link, and I look forward to passage of this bill as an importantpart of that effort.The concept of priority projects was developed and first approved in theSenate Environment and Public Works Committee during consideration of the1986 highway bill. I believe it is because of this innovation that thefull Senate adopted the measure by the first unanimous vote on a highwayauthorization bill in the history of the Federal-aid program.I remind my colleagues that giving a highway project this ``priority''status merely gives a State transportation department greater flexibilitywith respect to the use of its regularly apportioned Federal-aid highwayfunds on the segment of highway so designated. A State does not receiveadditional Federal funds for priority projects, and priority project statusdoes not require a State to spend any money or do any work on the highwaygranted that special status. The priority project designation merely givesa State more funding flexibility for whatever work it may choose to doon that highway.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Director Kiebert's letter regardingU.S. 95 and the text of the bill be printed in the <T4>Record</T4> immediately following my remarks.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a proposalwhich I believe will help bring homeownership back within the reach ofmillions of Americans. The bill I am introducing would establish a tax-preferredsavings account_similar to an individual retirement account_to assist potentialhomebuyers in saving for the downpayment on their first home.Owning one's own home continues to be the American dream, but it appearsto be slipping away from us. After 35 years of steady increases, homeownershiprates actually began to decline in 1980, and have been dropping ever since.We can and must turn this around. Since World War II, we have prided ourselveson being a nation of homeowners, with all that that implies: stable communities,improved standards of living, and the potential for households to buildequity in a solid investment. Now that status is in some doubt, and wemust take action.The consequences of declining homeownership reverberate throughout theeconomy. In my home State of Rhode Island, for example, home prices areincreasing six times faster than incomes. With prices increasing so rapidly,families who don't get on the home purchase price escalator may be permanentlyleft behind. They stay in the rental market, adding yet another sourceof pressure on affordable rent_pressure that it simply can't absorb atthis point.And, conversely, with rents being bid up so high, potential homebuyersfind it nearly impossible to save enough for a downpayment. In fact, manyfamilies' monthly rent is greater than the typical carrying costs of ahome. In these cases, the chief obstacle to homeownership is the lump sumrequired for a downpayment.The bill I am addressing today would address this by establishing tax-preferred``Homebuyers Savings Accounts''_or HSA's_to make it easier for potentialfirst-time homebuyers to save for a downpayment. A household saving forthe purchase of a home could make tax-deductible contributions into thisaccount of up to $5,000 per year, for a period of 5 years. In order totarget assistance to lower and middle-income homebuyers, HSA's would belimited to those with annual adjusted gross incomes of $50,000 or less.Interest on the contributions to an HSA would, as with the IRA, be taxfree. Also, there would be penalties for withdrawals from the HSA for purposesother than making the downpayment on a first home, just as there are penaltiesfor early withdrawals from an IRA.This proposal is similar to one advanced in a recent report from a high-leveltask force assigned by the Senate Housing Subcommittee to recommend comprehensivehousing policy reforms. In March, the National Housing Task Force releasedits recommendations, and among them was a proposal that individuals beallowed to use proceeds from IRA's or other self-funded pension plans forhome purchase downpayments.Rather than work through the existing IRA mechanism, however, I believewe need to set up a new mechanism specifically designed for home purchasedownpayments. The IRA was not designed for this purpose, and thus is notsuited to it in all respects. For example, my proposal would permit a moregenerous contribution, but over a limited period of time. This arrangementis better suited to home purchase savings than is the IRA's gradual, long-termaccumulation of funds.I also want to point out that this bill is a point of departure. The specificsthat I have proposed are not cast in concrete, and I look forward to workingwith my colleagues on refining the proposal so that it serves the needsof potential first-time homebuyers in the most efficient way we can devise.This bill complements legislation which I joined Senators <T4>Sasser</T4> and <T4>Heinz</T4> yesterday in introducing. That bill, the Homeownership AssistanceAct of 1988, expands the very successful mortgage insurance programs ofthe Federal Housing Administration [FHA] to make these programs more accessibleto potential homebuyers and to increase their flexibility.First, it implements the FHA program improvements that were recommendedby the Rouse-Maxwell National Housing Task Force. For example, it allowsFHA to make wider use of adjustable rate mortgages [ARM's]. It also replacesthe current mortgage limit cap of $102,250 with a cap that takes into accountthe special circumstances of high cost areas.In addition, the bill would authorize two new FHA demonstration programsdesigned to assist homebuyers in making downpayments. In one program, FHAwould be able to insure loans for the entire purchase price and closingcosts on a home. In the other, FHA would be able to insure second mortgagesto finance all or part of a downpayment.Mr. President, the evidence is irrefutable that buying a house is not whatit used to be. More and more families need some kind of assistance in orderto get over the hurdle of buying the first home.A few statistics from my State will illustrate what I mean. In Rhode Island,it takes an income of $43,000 to buy the median priced home_an income whichonly 23 percent of all Rhode Islanders have. Two out of three Rhode Islandfamilies could not afford to buy their own homes now if they were in themarket for the first time.Buying a house these days is like trying to leap onto a fast-moving escalator.You know you'll be in good shape once you get on, but the first step is5 feet high. In these extraordinarily difficult times, I think it appropriatethat we use an instrument like homebuyers savings accounts to give first-timehomebuyers a boost over this, the first and biggest hurdle to homeownership.I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the <T4>Record </T4>at this point, and I urge my colleagues to give it theirsupport.There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record, </T4>as follows:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1580]{S5818}S. 2392<ITAG tagnum="74"/>S. 2392<ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UnitedStates of America in Congress assembled,</T3>[S13MY8-1581]{S5818}SECTION1.<ITAG tagnum="72">SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today,along with Mr. <T4>Weicker, </T4>Mr. <T4>Kennedy, </T4>Mr. <T4>Hatch, </T4>Mr. <T4>Simon, </T4>Mr. <T4>Stafford, </T4>Mr. <T4>Adams, </T4>and Mr. <T4>Metzenbaum</T4> legislation that reauthorizes and extends for 3 yearsthe Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986.While the funding authorized under this act is small compared to otherlegislation concerning persons with disabilities, the assistance made availableis of critical importance in assisting States establish and operate protectionand advocacy systems for mentally ill individuals.In 1984, Senator <T4>Weicker,</T4> the then chairman of the Subcomittee on the Handicapped,directed his staff to investigate the care and treatment of, among others,individuals with mental illnesses who were inpatients or residents in residentialfacilities.The staff report documented dangerous conditions and ``a climate of fearand intimidation'' in 19 States and 31 facilities. The staff report concludedthat: ``Abuse and neglect of society's most vulnerable citizens must stop.Care and treatment must be provided in an atmosphere of dignity and respect.And those to whom this care is entrusted must be held fully accountable.''The report drew attention to the fact that mentally ill individuals whowere inpatients and residents in facilities did not have access to thesame type of protection and advocacy services available to individualswho are developmentally disabled.Following the submission of the report, the subcommittee held hearings,at which the witnesses confirmed the findings of the staff report. Followingthe hearings, Senator<T4> Weicker</T4> introduced S. 974, authorizing the establishment of asystem of protection and advocacy for mentally ill individuals in eachState. The bill passed the Senate on July 31, 1985; a companion bill passedthe House on January 30, 1986; the Senate and the House worked out theirdifferences in May of 1986; and the President signed the bill into lawon May 23, 1986.Under the act, the systems' mission includes protecting and advocatingfor the rights of mentally ill individuals and investigating incidentsof abuse and neglect of mentally ill individuals who are residents or inpatientsin facilities rendering care or treatment.In addition, the act authorizes the system to pursue allegations of abuseand neglect arising within 90 days after the client's discharge from aresidential facility. The system is required to maintain the confidentialityof patient records to which it gains access.The entity operating the system is the same entity that operates the protectionand advocacy system for persons with developmental disabilities under theDevelopmental Disabilities Bill of Rights and Assistance Act. However,the system is encouraged to cooperate and subcontract with mental healthadvocacy organizations in the State.Each system is required to establish an advisory board including attorneys,mental health professionals and providers; and at least half of the membersmust be consumers (individuals who have received or are receiving mentalhealth services or who are family members of such individuals).Although the act was authorized for 3 fiscal years_1986 through 1988, thefirst fiscal year saw no activity. The act was passed in May and grantawards were issued in September. As of May 1, 1988, the program has onlybeen operational for 19 months.The bill includes several amendments designed to clarify current law. First,``death'' is specifically listed as a form of abuse and neglect. Second,the bill makes it clear that systems may investigate situations where amentally ill person's whereabouts are unknown (the person may have disappearedbecause of the neglect of an employee at an institution). Third, the billmakes it clear that the system may investigate abuse and neglect of a personwho is in the process of being admitted into a facility rendering careor treatment, including persons being transported to such a facility. Finally,the bill clarifies that reports of abuse and neglect prepared by a facilityand discharge reports are considered ``records'' for purposes of the actand thus may be accessed under the applicable circumstances currently ineffect.The bill also makes several changes related to the governance of the protectionand advocacy systems. First, the bill requires that in States which havemultimember governing boards, such boards be broadly representative ofthe clients it serves. Second, in the case of a system organized as a privatenonprofit entity, the chairperson of the advisory council must be includedon the governing board. Third, the system's priorities must be jointlydeveloped by the governing board and the advisory council; however, finalapproval of the priorities remains with the governing board. Finally, theannual report prepared by the system must include a section by the advisorycouncil describing the activities of the council and its assessment ofthe operations of the system.In addition, the bill directs the Comptroller General of the General AccountingOffice to prepare and submit a study of, among other things, whether individualswith mental illness held in Federal, State, and local jails and prisonsare being subjected to abuse and neglect or inappropriately confined tojails rather than being served by appropriate mental health programs.Further, the bill includes several miscellaneous provisions. First, thebill provides that a system should consider entering into contracts withgroups run by individuals who have received or are receiving mental healthservices, or the family members of such individuals. Second, the bill increasesthe percentage of funds that may be used by systems for training and technicalassistance from 5 percent to 15 percent. Third, the bill places a 2-percentcap on the amount of the appropriation the Secretary may use for technicalassistance. Fourth, the bill establishes a grievance procedure for clientsof the systems. Finally, the bill provides for a 3-year application period.The bill increases the minimum allotment for States from $125,000 to $140,000if Congress appropriates at least $13 million. The authorization levelis $14.3 million for fiscal year 1989; $18.5 million for fiscal year 1990;and $23.5 million for fiscal year 1991.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S13MY8-1586]{S5821}WEICKER<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator <T4>Harkin, </T4>the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on theHandicapped, to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Protection andAdvocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of 1986. This legislation wasoriginally enacted in response to the appalling conditions in residentialfacilities for the mentally ill which were uncovered during a 6-month Senateinvestigation and 3 days of hearings before the Subcommittee on the Handicapped.During the course of those hearings, and in-site visits to 31 facilitiesin 19 States, two facts became abundantly clear. First, mentally ill individualsliving in those facilities were subject to abuse and neglect. Second, thoseindividuals often did not have access to adequate representation or advocacyto remedy the abuse and neglect that befell them. The systems that didexist to protect mentally ill persons were typically understaffed, overloadedwith cases, and many times, were staffed by employees of the very entitythat had permitted the abuse and neglect to occur.As the hearings that exposed this shocking situation came to a close, ithad become painfully evident that, instead of being treated with dignityand respect, these individuals were being deprived of their most fundamentalrights. Clearly, action had to be taken to ensure the protection of therights of these individuals, and allow them to receive treatment in anatmosphere free from abusive and neglectful conditions.Shortly thereafter, I introduced S. 974, to create an independent, federallyfunded system of protection and advocacy for mentally ill persons in eachState. After 13 months of negotiations with the administration, serviceproviders, consumers and advocates, this bill became law. With its enactment,a system was established to afford mentally ill persons assistance to helpthem secure their rights guaranteed under Federal and State statutes andthe U.S. Constitution. It has now been 2 years since that legislation was signed into law, duringwhich time this system has become operational in every State. Preliminarydata regarding the program indicate that protection and advocacy systemsaround the country have had an active year, serving a total of 9,758 clientslast year through both individual protective actions and systems advocacycases. Unfortunately, the deplorable conditions uncovered during the investigation3 years ago have not been eradicated despite the valiant efforts of theprotection and advocacy systems. Testimony presented this week to the subcommitteeindicate that mentally ill persons continue to suffer injustice at thehands of a system that is supposed to help them. Since Congress first began its consideration of the protection and advocacylegislation, approximately $30 million in Federal funds have been providedto establish and operate these programs. However, the fact remains thatlimited financial resources prevent protection and advocacy agencies fromreaching a substantial number of individuals who require advocacy and assistanceto secure their rights. Some agencies, such as the Office of Protectionand Advocacy in my own State of Connecticut, have been forced to limittheir activities to one part of the State. Again for lack of sufficientresources, many protection and advocacy agencies are simply unable to reachentire facilities which provide care and treatment to mentlly ill individuals.Clearly, when such an individual is being abused or neglected, he or sheshould be able to receive assistance under this legislation. Therefore, in order to respond to the pressing need for additional resources,the reauthorization provides for substantial increases in funding levels.Specifically, the bill provides for a 30-percent annual growth in the programfor each of the next 3 years. In addition, the bill includes refinements which will improve the abilityof protection and advocacy systems to investigate abuse and neglect, andprovide for enhanced involvement by consumers in establishing the prioritiesof the systems in their States.These refinements include a provision that permits protection and advocacysystems to investigate incidents of abuse and neglect of individuals whohave either died, whose whereabouts are unknown, or who are in the processof being admitted to a hospital. Additionally, the bill states that reportsof abuse and neglect as well as discharge summaries prepared by the facilityare considered records and thereby accessible to the protection and advocacysystem. These clarifications will strengthen these systems' ability tocarry out their legislative charge to pursue legal, administrative andother remedies to protect mentally ill individuals from abuse and neglect.The bill further states that the advisory councils, as renamed in the bill,will jointly develop program priorities with the Governing Board of theProtection and Advocacy System, although the final decision regarding prioritieswill remain with the governing board.

This appointment authority would be limited to those graduateswho served under an appointment in a VA health-care facility in a clinicaleducation program which was affiliated with an accredited college or university.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under its statutory mission to develop and carry out a program ofeducation and training of health-care personnel for the Nation, VA trainsannually in clinical education programs in our facilities approximately50,000 students in ``allied health-care'' professions, including pharmacology,occupational therapy, psychology, social work, audiology, speech pathology,dietetics, and recreational therapy. Yet current law prevents hiring thesestudents in many of these professions upon graduation without first undergoingthe complicated and often lengthy process required under the civil servicecompetitive system. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, when a highly-qualified student in a title 5 ``allied health-care''profession with excellent training in an affiliated clinical educationprogram at a VA facility receives his or her professional degree and expressesan interest in working at the VA facility, the facility is unable to offerthat professional a position until the entire civil service process iscompleted. The result, as documented in a 1982 VA report to Congress, isthat highly motivated potential employees become frustrated with the lengthand complexity of the procedures and accept offers elsewhere. A VA studyfound that fewer than six percent of students take jobs with the VA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">facility where they were trained. We believe that the civil servicehiring procedures significantly impede Agency efforts to secure as employeescandidates who, through their performance in our facilities, have morethan satisfied VA of their qualifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Currently, VA is experiencing staff shortages in certain of these``allied health-care'' positions, and the situation could get worse. Thereis a decreasing number of individuals entering training for many of theseprofessions and an intense competition for these professionals, especiallyrecent graduates. The draft bill would enable VA to meet current and futureshortages by offering employment as rapidly as other health-care employerswith whom we compete and take advantage of training relationships by allowingthe Agency to secure career commitments even in advance of graduation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This proposal would not only help VA anticipate and deal with theshortages but would improve on current hiring procedures for these positions,without jeopardizing the principles of merit selection. We believe theproposal would permit us to select professionals who have served undersupervision at a VA facility where we were able to directly observe andevaluate whether their performance and skills meet our standards. Beforeoffering employment, in short, VA would know their qualifications. Thedirect hiring authority would also remove the largely redundant ``red-tape''barrier between our readiest source of supply for these professions andour staffing requirements and could prevent any disruption of care becausewe could give qualified students career appointments immediately upon graduation.Finally, this proposal would save resources that are now expended to recruitand screen applicants for these professions, eliminating the need for tedious,costly, and time-consuming orientation and training periods for new employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be emphasized that under this direct-hire authority, notonly must the graduates meet VA's high standards for a position in ourfacilities, but they must have served under an appointment from the Agencyin an affiliated clinical education program in a VA facility. In exercisingthis authority, VA would remain subject to the prohibitions in the currentlaw against giving preferences not based on merit and against otherwiseabusing merit principles. When a qualified graduate is not available, VAintends to continue to rely on the civil service register as a valuablesource for qualified individuals for employment in ``allied health care''professions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, the draft bill does not extend benefits or privileges notalready provided to other title 5 employees and specifically preservesthe current statutory preference for hiring veterans. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The draft bill would not result in any additional costs to VA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objectionfrom the standpoint of the Administration's program to submission of thedraft bill to Congress. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Sincerely, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="57">Thomas K.

A bill to facilitate commercial access to space, and for otherpurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.[S13MY8-1594]{S5823}commercial<ITAG tagnum="89">commercial space launch act amendments</ITAG>[S13MY8-1595]{S5823}WIRTHMr. WIRTH. Mr. President, today, with Senators <T4>Bentsen </T4>and <T4>Danforth, </T4>I am introducing the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendmentsof 1988. This bill will improve the ability of our young but growing commerciallaunch industry to compete in the global marketplace.In 1984, Congress, recognizing the importance of the development of a vigorousdomestic commercial space launch industry, passed the Commercial SpaceLaunch Act, Public Law 98-575. This important statute established the regulatoryframework necessary to foster the development of private sector satellitelaunch services. At the same time, the act preserves the national securityand foreign policy priorities of the United States, and provides for thesafety and protection of the public.Following the tragic destruction of the space shuttle <T3>Challenger </T3>on January 28, 1986, the need for a vital, growingcommercial launch industry became more pressing. Within 7 months of thisevent, the President announced that NASA would no longer provide launchservices for commercial satellite customers. Rather, Government resources,including the space shuttle, would be reserved solely for Government-sponsoredresearch or military payloads.This chain of events stranded 44 satellites previously scheduled for launchaboard the space shuttle. The fragile nature of our ability to gain accessto space became clear, and we now know that it was unwise to expect theshuttle program to accommodate all of our military and civilian needs.We must work to develop a mixed fleet capability_utilizing both expandableand reusable launch vehicles.However, Mr. President, these conditions also created the fertile groundnecessary for the development of a commercial space launch industry. SeveralAmerican companies have responded admirably to this challenge, includingtwo which have significant presences in my own state of Colorado_MartinMarietta and McDonnell Douglas. These corporations have made significantinvestments in the development, construction, and marketing of a privatesector launch capacity. This domestic fleet of expendable launch vehicles will not only removesignificant pressures on NASA to launch, but, by assuring America's accessto space, will contribute to our economic and national security. A healthyprivate sector launch infrastructure can reduce government costs of acquiringELV's by encouraging manufacturer to produce a larger volume of rockets,will contribute $800 million annually to the U.S. balance of payments,and will directly create jobs for up to 8,000 persons in the United States.Unfortunately, a serious threat exists to the continued welfare of thisfledgling <ITAG tagnum="80">industry_and, consequently, our Nation's essential ability to gainand retain access to space. Prior to the administration's 1986 decisionto ban commercial launches by NASA, the Federal Government shared in therisks of space launch ventures with private companies. Under this policyNASA sold launch services to commercial customers and foreign governments.As part of the transaction, the clients were required to buy $500 millionin liability insurance to cover third party claims that might result froman accident. The Government assumed responsibility in the unlikely eventthat claims were awarded above this amount_an event that has never occurred,since no third party claim was ever filed.</ITAG>However, as of the President's announcement banning commercial launchesby NASA, the ELV manufacturers must obtain the maximum amount of liabilityinsurance possible at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, the maximum possiblelosses which could result from an unsuccessful rocket launch not only exceedsthe amount of insurance available at reasonable costs, but also exceedsworldwide insurance capacity. In the unlikely event that a third partyclaim is successfully litigated, the ELV manufacturer would be responsiblefor losses exceeding the insured amount in accordance with the generalprinciples of tort and contract law. In the worst case scenario, this financialresponsbility could well exceed the total resources of any company. Consequently,the ELV firms are presently operating with an unbounded liability, a factwhich is having the undesirable <T3>effect </T3>of hurting the ability of our domestic industry to competeworldwide.The U.S. commercial launch industry operates in a global marketplace andour domestic ELV manufacturers must be able to compete successfully withthe growing numbers of overseas competitors. Unlike our domestic industry,foreign launch programs receive substantial subsidies from their governments.For example, the French Government and the European Space Agency [ESA]indemnify Arianespace for third party losses in excess of the extremelylow threshold of $70 million. The resulting savings are passed on to theircustomers. In the case of both the Soviet Proton or the Chinese Long Marchlaunch vehicles, their respective governments assume all risk for damageto third parties, in addition to offering prices below cost. Consequently,customer buying decisions are being made on the basis of the costs of insuranceand the risk of third party claims, to the competitive detriment of theU.S. marketer of launch services who has no control over these factors.The legislation we are introducing today seeks to address these problems.Modeled on the risk-sharing agreements used by NASA for commercial launcheson the space shuttle, the bill would require providers of launch servicesto obtain the maximum insurance available at a reasonable cost, not toexceed $500 million, for the payment of claims resulting from third partyinjuries. In addition, the provider would also be required to purchase$100 million of insurance_under similar conditions_to cover possible damageto Government launch facilities in the event of an unsuccessful launch.Mr. President, I believe this will help create a level playing field forthe fledgling U.S. expendable launch vehicle industry in internationalcompetition. By providing indemnification for losses above this reasonableinsurance limit, we can help make both the providers of launch servicesand the payload manufacturers more competitive, guarantee the continuedgrowth and development of this essential industry, and strengthen our nationalsecurity by insuring a continued U.S. access to space.In writing this bill, we closely consulted with the ELV manufacturers,satellite companies and insurance industry, who are all supportive of theconcepts embodied in this legislation. In addition, the House Committeeon Science, Space, and Technology reported out a companion measure on April21, 1988.Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators <T4>Bentsen </T4>and <T4>Danforth </T4>for their invaluable assistance, and wouldlike to inviteand encourage other Senators to cosponsor the Commercial Space Launch ActAmendments of 1988.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleaguefrom Colorado as an original sponsor of the Commercial Space Launch ActAmendments of 1988. I want to commend Senator <T4>Wirth</T4> for his foresight in addressing a crucial problem facingour domestic commercial expendable launch vehicle [ELV] industry. Unquestionably,an integral element of our Nation's space launch capability is a resilientELV capability. This bill recognizes the relationship between such a capabilityand a competitive U.S. commercial ELV industry and seeks to enhance thecompetitiveness of our domestic commercial ELV capability.One of the greatest burdens that our embryonic commercial ELV industryfaces is catastrophic and virtually unlimited exposure to financial liabilityin the event of a space launch accident. Because there are no mechanismsto control launch liability, a launch provider must place the company onthe line with each launch. This legislation would clearly delineate thefinancial risk that a company launching a national security or civil payloadmust assume.Such risk parameters are especially crucial to a commercial industry thatmust compete with foreign companies that are subsidized by their governments.Our commercial ELV industry faces still competition not only from its traditionalrival, the French Ariane vehicle, but now it must also compete againstthe Soviet Proton vehicle, and the Chinese Long March vehicle.Mr. President, this expanded field of foreign competitors should not bea major concern to us; in a free-trading commercial market, competitionis an inherently health dimension. However, we should be concerned whenthis competition is not conducted on a level playing field. In the caseof the world launch market, the playing field is titled toward our foreigncompetition as a result of these subsidies.One of the various forms of foreign government subsidy is the indemnificationof potential third-party claims that could arise from a luanch accident.For example, customers of the French Ariane ELV are insured by the FrenchGovernment against any third-party claims in excess of $75 million.Clearly, our commercial ELV industry is unable to match such terms andconditions. However, this legislation is a step in the right direction.Specifically, this legislation would clearly define a commercial launchprovider's liability with respect to third-party claims, and claims thatcould arise from launch accidents that damage government property. Further,the <ITAG tagnum="80">legislation provides that the U.S. Government will indemnify againstexcess claims over the prescribed ceiling.</ITAG>Specifically, this legislation would set forth that launch providers wouldnot be required to obtain insurance or to demonstrate financial responsibilityin an amount that exceeds either $500 million or the maximum liabilityinsurance available on the world market at a reasonable cost, whicheveris less. Further, the Secretary of Transportation, as agent for the U.S.Government, would satisfy any excess claims.For potential claims that could arise from accidents to Government propertyas a result of a launch accident, the liability ceiling would be set at$100 million or the minimum insurance available on the world market ata reasonable cost, whichever is less. Just as with excess third-party claims,the Secretary of Transportation, as agent for the United States, wouldsatisfy any excess claims arising from damage to Government property.Mr. President, some may question the potential cost to the Government ofthis legislation. It is worth noting that there has never been a third-partyclaim arising from a space launch. The chances of such claims ever arisingare extremely remote. Yet, as remote as third-party claims may be, thepotentially limitless exposure that our domestic ELV industry must insureagainst is a deterrent to the growth that is critical to compete world-wide.Clearly, this legislation makes good sense. It will help our commercialELV industry compete on more equal terms with its competitors by improvingthe industry's ability to manage its risks. Furthermore, a viable commmercialELV industry will maintain for the United States a more robust industrialbase, which is important to our national security and to our civil spaceprogram. Certainly, if a healthy ELV industry were in-place at the timeof the <T3>Challenger </T3>tragedy, national security, and civil space payloadswould not still be waiting for a launch.Mr. President, even though I support this legislation in principal, I wouldlike to reserve the opportunity to recommend changes, as warranted, oncethis bill is referred to the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committeeis scheduled to hold a hearing on this legislation on May 17, and thishearing will give the committee the opportunity to consider more closelythe individual provisions of this bill.This legislation addresses one of the most acute problems facing our commercialELV industry_the ability to compete on equal terms. I urge the supportof my colleague for this bill. It is a critical element in the future successof an important domestic industry and in the restoration of our civil spaceprogram.[S13MY8-1608]{S5826}F<ITAG

Mr. President, in studying the high incidence ofinfant mortality and low birthweight, I have had the opportunity to visita number of neonatal clinics in this country. In these clinics, speciallytrained teams of physicians and nurses watch over helpless infants whohave been born prematurely, underweight, or with multiple disabilities.The tragedy is, Mr. President, that many of these birth defects could havebeen prevented.Over 3,000 babies are born yearly with birth defects associated with maternaldrinking during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the only preventablebirth defect among the top three types of birth defects in the United States,but only about 50 percent of Americans have heard of fetal alcohol syndrome.In the effort to educate the public about the consequences of drinkingduring pregnancy, Congress has designated this week as ``Fetal AlcoholSyndrome Awareness Week.'' Mr. President, the National Women's Health Reporthas released the following report on fetal alcohol syndrome, and I wouldlike to include it in the <T4>Record </T4>as part of our effort to raise awareness on this problem.The report follows:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1863]{S5842}Drinking a<ITAG tagnum="74">Drinking and Pregnancy: Not a Compatible Marriage</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fact: In 1981, the Surgeon General of the US issued a health advisoryrecommending that women who are pregnant or are considering pregnancy shouldabstain from alcoholic beverages and should be aware of the alcohol contentof foods, beverages, and medications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Why such a terse warning against drinking during pregnancy? FetalAlcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a pattern of mental, physical, and behavioralbirth defects found in the infants of alcoholic mothers. Officially recognizedin 1973 by physicians at the University of Washington, FAS affects an estimated1-3 births per 1000 each year. FAS is the third leading cause of mentalretardation in this country behind Down syndrome and neural tube defectssuch as spina bifida. The good news is that, unlike the latter two birthdefects, FAS is totally preventable. Women can guard against FAS by notdrinking alcohol at all during pregnancy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important to realize that the effects of alcohol on the fetusare believed to lie on a dose-dependent continuum. The more a pregnantwoman drinks, the more severe the congenital birth defects that may develop.The alcoholic mothers of the originally identified FAS children all drankheavily throughout pregnancy. But, even small amounts of alcohol consumedduring pregnancy can have deleterious effects on the developing embryo.Clearly, there are potentially serious implications for the social-drinkingpregnant woman. ``Fetal Alcohol Effects'' (FAE), a recently-coined term,refers to alcohol-related birth defects in infants and children which donot meet the diagnostic criteria for full-blown FAS. No threshold of ``safe''drinking during pregnancy has been established.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1864]{S5843}FAS Charac<ITAG tagnum="89">FAS Characteristics</ITAG>[S13MY8-1865]{S5843}<ITAG tagnum="21">FAS damage is most noticeable in three areas_growth retardation, damageto the central nervous system (including mental retardation), and facialabnormalities. Physiological characteristics of FAS infants and childreninclude:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Short palpebral fissures (eye openings abnormally small)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ptosis (upper eyelids drooped)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Noses short, creating a wide space above upper lip</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upper lip very thin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Philtrum, the indentation in the skin that is normally present justabove upper lip, reduced or missing</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cheekbones flattened</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Children small for their age, with heads abnormally small</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Problems with cortical functions such as cognition, muscle control,and fine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">motor skills are evident.

Exactly how alcoholdamages the developing fetus is still unknown, but numerous studies showthat alcohol and acetaldehyde, its first byproduct, are directly toxicto the embryo. Essentially, when the pregnant mother drinks, her baby ``drinks''too. Scientists previously suspected that malnutrition, caused by chronicproblem drinking, was responsible for FAS. It is now believed that ethanol,found in all liquor, beer, and wine, is the true culprit. However, thecombined effect of alcohol consumption and malnutrition during pregnancymay exacerbate the effects of FAS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Alcohol can also interfere with the physiological systems involvedwith pregnancy maintenance. This may explain the high rate of miscarriageand stillbirth associated with maternal alcoholism.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fact: One in six women in the peak childbearing years of 18-34 maydrink enough, either chronically or episodically, to present a hazard toan unborn infant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fortunately, the frequency of FAS and alcohol-related birth defectsis much lower than the frequency of abusive drinking among pregnant women.It appears that alcohol's impact on the fetus and fetal development isor can be modified by other factors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The type of alcohol a pregnant woman drinks may affect the risk offetal damage. A 1982 study by Sokol and Kuzma found that chronic beer consumptionduring pregnancy was one of the most significant contributing factors toalcohol-induced growth retardation. Other risk factor associations forFAS, uncovered by the Cleveland Fetal Alcohol Study, include increasedmaternal age, increased frequency of black race, greater number of previouspregnancies, higher frequency of problem drinking, greater proportion ofdrinking days, and greater consumption of alcohol per drinking day.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1868]{S5843}pregnancy <ITAG tagnum="89">pregnancy after age 30 and ``social'' drinking</ITAG>[S13MY8-1869]{S5843}<ITAG tagnum="21">Problem drinking among women tends to develop between the ages of35 and 49. Women who become pregnant after age 30 should be aware thatthe risk of FAS doubles with increased maternal age. Furthermore, the SeattleLongitudinal Study on Alcohol and Pregnancy found that alternating moderate-to-heavydrinking with periods of abstinence can produce the same average dailyalcohol consumption as daily light drinking at a constant level, or evena lower daily average. Yet, episodic drinking may be more damaging to thefetus if heavier drinking coincides with the most critical stages of fetaldevelopment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Contrary to popular belief, drinking among pregnant women is not confinedto lower socioeconomic groups. In fact, a study by Dr. Rosett at BostonCity Hospital revealed that 50 percent of women from lower socioeconomicgroups are totally abstemious. Alcohol consumption rises with socioeconomicstatus and years of college education.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fact: Well-designed studies link an average daily consumption of 1to 2 drinks to decreased birthweight, growth abnormalities and behavioralproblems in the newborn and infant. Increased risk of spontaneous abortion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">has been found at an even lower dose: 1 to 2 drinks twice weekly.The Ottawa Prenatal Prospective Study suggested that ``social'' drinkingduring pregnancy was associated with lower scores on tests of spoken languageand verbal comprehension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because no threshold of ``safe'' drinking during pregnancy has beenestablished, ``social'' drinking is not advisable during pregnancy.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1870]{S5843}Preparatio<ITAG tagnum="89">Preparation for Pregnancy and Post-Partum</ITAG>[S13MY8-1871]{S5843}<ITAG tagnum="21">Researchers have identified the third week of human pregnancy as anespecially vulnerable time for the embryo in terms of alcohol-induced damage.At this time, during the first trimester, many pregnant women are stillunaware of their pregnancy. This illustrates the importance of abstinencefrom, or limitation of, alcohol even during the planning stages of pregnancy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Preparation for pregnancy through abstinence or limitation shouldbe a tandem effort. It is not yet known to what extent the father's drinkingmay affect his sperm, but alcohol may reduce his sperm count, making fertilizationdifficult. How or if alcohol's effect on the sperm may harm the developingfetus is undetermined. Conception may also be difficult for women who drinkheavily since alcohol can cause infertility and absent or reduced menstruation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Women should continue to avoid alcohol consumption when they are breastfeeding.Alcohol appears in the breast milk, is transmitted to the nursing infant,and slows down the process of milk ejection from the breast.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1872]{S5843}Public Awa<ITAG tagnum="89">Public Awareness of FAS</ITAG>[S13MY8-1873]{S5843}<ITAG tagnum="21">Fact: In the 1985 National Health Interview Survey conducted by theNational Center for Health Statistics, only 57 percent of persons under45 years of age had ever heard of fetal alcohol syndrome.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Almost 2000 articles about FAS and alcohol-related birth defects havebeen published worldwide since FAS was officially identified 15 years ago.But, statistics like the one above dramatically highlight the public'signorance of the issue.

Mr. President, I am here as a part of the ongoingeffort of the Congressional Call to Conscience for Soviet Jews to speakout on behalf of Soviet Jews seeking freedom of religion and the rightto emigrate.I was gratified to learn at the beginning of this month that one refusenikwhose release I had sought, Vladimir Tufeld, had been granted permissionto leave the Soviet Union. His visitor's visa will enable Mr. Tufeld tobe reunited with his wife, Isolda, who was allowed to leave the SovietUnion several years ago to undergo brain surgery at Johns Hopkins. Sheis still a patient there, in poor condition.This is a joyous time for the Tufelds, and for all of us who have workedto gain Vladimir's release. Yet, for every Vladimir Tufeld, there are thousandsof refuseniks who are not granted permission to leave. In the hopeful anticipationthat surrounds President Reagan's upcoming summit meeting with GeneralSecretary Gorbachev, we must not forget that while the Soviet Union hasshown a willingness to take positive steps to peace, they still have notshown the same willingness to extend basic human freedoms to their owncitizens. The freedom to emigrate is still consistently denied citizensof the Soviet Union.Despite Soviet willingness to let some well-known refuseniks emigrate lastyear, thousands of lesser known people remain. Some are denied visas onthe pretext that they or members of their families possess national secrets.Families are often separated by a cruel practice whereby only some membersare permitted to leave.While we should appreciate Soviet interest in and encourage their willingnessto achieve meaningful arms reductions, we must not be fooled into thinkingthat glasnost means a thaw in the treatment of Soviet Jews and others whowish to emigrate. Emigration is an internationally recognized right. Sovietcitizens should be permitted by law to apply for emigration, without specialstipulations on the country of destination or the presence of family membersoutside the Soviet Union.I have made my view clear to both the President and the Secretary of Statethat we must make human rights_and especially Soviet Jewry_an issue inall negotiations with the Soviets. President Reagan has done this, andI am hopeful that he will again raise the issue when he travels to Moscowlater this month.As one of the cochairmen of the Congressional Call to Conscience for 1988,I'd like to thank those of my Senate colleagues who have made statementsand written letters on behalf of Soviet Jews, and would like to encouragethe participation of those Senators who have not yet done so as we continuethis effort through the summer until the October recess.

I would like to expressmy appreciation to Senator <T4>Alan Cranston,</T4> chairman of the committee, for holding this importanthearing. I would also like to thank Senator <T4>Tom Daschle</T4> for his leadership on this issue and for his participationin the hearing. Chris Gregory, a Massachusetts veteran and former directorof the Massachusetts Agent Orange Program, also testified and made a valuablecontribution to the hearing.I was also particularly pleased to hear the testimony of Adm. Elmo Zumwalt.I have great respect for Admiral Zumwalt, and I was honored to receivea medal from him during my tour of service in Vietnam. He has a uniqueperspective on the agent orange issue, having been involved with its usein Vietnam and having suffered from its effects at home in his own family.He has given a great deal of thought and study to this difficult issueand has made an important contribution.Admiral Zumwalt stated in his testimony, ``As one who shares personal responsibilityfor the use of agent orange, I believe the time has come for this countryto make some compensatory amends.'' I hope that this hearing will leadto action on legislation to compensate the victims of agent orange in thenear future. I ask that the text of my prepared statement for the hearingand that of Admiral Zumwalt be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>The statements follow:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1880]{S5844}Statement <ITAG tagnum="74">Statement of Senator John Kerry, Senate Veterans Affairs Committee_Hearingon Agent Orange</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to testify once againbefore this Committee on the subject of Agent Orange. I appreciate yourwillingness to hold this hearing and to consider legislation providingcompensation for the victims of Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Last year, when I testified before this committee on Agent Orange,I stressed the importance of this issue to Vietnam veterans. It is justas important today. Agent Orange is a pressing concern_literally a matterof life and death_for many Vietnam veterans. The issue will not go away.It is time for Congress to address the concerns of Agent Orange victims,and to provide compensation for those who are suffering from diseases causedby exposure to Agent Orange. I hope that you will join me in leading thatfight.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, Vietnam was obviously one of our most controversialwars. You were one of those who spoke out courageously against the warat an early point. Many of us joined you in that opposition. Others justas strongly supported the war and felt it was the right thing to do. Thereis no need to refight those battles now.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is a need to avoid making Vietnam veterans the last victimsof the Vietnam war. But our debt to Vietnam veterans should not be repaidonly in rhetoric. The Welcome Home parades are important. The Vietnam Memorialis important. The parades, the concerts, the resolutions, are all important.But there is something more important than symbolism. And that is justiceand fairness towards Vietnam veterans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We now have a proposal to elevate the Veterans Administration to Cabinet-levelstatus. Make no mistake_I support that legislation, and I think that thesymbolism and the recognition of veterans that it implies is good. ButI am concerned that we are one again falling into the trap of substitutingsymbolism for substance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But far more important than symbolism is the reality of how we treatour veterans who are still suffering. And I believe that it is nothingless than wrong on the facts to tell Vietnam veterans that we cannot compensatefor diseases which were caused by their exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam.It is offensive to veterans to tell them that there is not enough ``scientificevidence'' to justify compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, as time goes on, the evidence on Agent Orange becomesstronger and stronger. That is not surprising, since we know that it takesmany years for cancers and other disease to develop which are linked toAgent Orange exposure. Let me review just a few of the studies which havecome out in the past few years on this subject.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1983, the VA Agent Orange registry found excessive cancers amongVietnam veterans of two types_non-Hodgkins lymphomas, and cancers of theoral cavity and pharynx.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A 1983 study by the Massachusetts Agent Orange Commission found excessivenumbers of soft-tissue sarcomas and cancer of the kidney among Vietnamveterans exposed to Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1984 Ranch Hand baseline study found higher amounts of skin cancersand systemic cancers, twice as many cancers of the lip, oral cavity andpharynx, and three times as many cancers of the respiratory system, chestand genito-urinary system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A 1985 study in Wisconsin found excessive incidences of soft-tissuesarcomas among Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A 1986 study in West Virginia found higher incidences of non-Hodgkinslymphomas, and cancers of the testes, larynx, and respiratory system amongVietnam veterans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The preliminary results of the CDC Vietnam Experience Study releasedin 1987 showed excessive instances of lymphosarcomas, leukemia, and braincancer among Vietnam veterans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The VA Mortality Study released in 1987, a survey of 50,000 veterans,showed rates of death due to non-Hodgkins lymphoma 110 percent higher thannormal, and deaths due to lung cancer 58 percent higher than normal amongMarines who served in areas heavily sprayed with Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1987 Ranch Hand follow-up study showed excessive incidence ofskin cancers, systemic neoplasms, lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcomas, threetimes as many cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, twice as many cancersof the bronchus and lung, and three times the number of testicular neoplasms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And the report released on the Ranch Hand study in March of 1988,at the request of Senator Daschle and myself, showed higher incidencesof tumors, birth defects, psychological disorders, blood toxicity, andcardiovascular problems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the results which have just been released this week fromthe CDC Vietnam Experience Study show higher incidence among Vietnam veteransof fertility problems, low sperm count, depression, alcohol problems, anxietydisorders, skin disorders, and birth defects. I hope that these resultswill be made a part of the record, and studied carefully. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other studies relating to dioxin have also shown similar results.A 1986 study by the National Cancer Institute of farmers in Kansas whohad been exposed to herbicides similar to Agent Orange showed an incidenceof non-Hodgkins lymphoma six times higher than normal. Studies in Swedenshowed incidences of soft-tissue sarcoma five to seven times higher thannormal with phenoxy-herbicide exposure. And other studies have shown similarresults. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">So to those who say ``we don't have enough evidence'', I would ask_Howhigh does the body count have to go? How many more Vietnam veterans haveto die before we have ``enough evidence'' to start admitting the truthand compensating veterans? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Our legislation would establish a presumption of service-connectionfor two of these diseases, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and lung cancer. In additionit would ask the National Academy of Sciences to review the evidence ofthe scientific studies and compile a list of other diseases which are linkedto suppression of the immune system, which may be linked to dioxin or AgentOrange exposure. If appropriate, these diseases would be added and a resumptionof service-connection created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, it is important to understand how strongly Vietnam veteransfeel about this subject. At Vet Centers throughout Massachusetts, and atVA clinics and hospitals, I have met with Vietnam veterans and veteransgroups. And I know that Vietnam veterans feel very, very strongly aboutthis issue. You cannot tell a Vietnam veteran that there is ``not enoughevidence'' on Agent Orange. They know what the evidence is. For one thing,the evidence is in their own bodies, and even worse, in the bodies of theirchildren. They have no doubt about that. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, you led the fight to gain compensation for the veteranswho are victims of atomic radiation. You argued against those in the VAand elsewhere who would tell us that there is ``no scientific evidence''to link radiation with cancer_exactly the same argument they use with AgentOrange. I supported you in that fight. And last month, we won in the UnitedStates Senate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But before we won the fight for atomic veterans, some of them hadto wait 40 years or more for compensation. And many of them died beforethey reached that day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We should not make Vietnam veterans wait 40 years for compensation.I hope we are not going to wait until the 21st Century to tell Vietnamveterans that the evidence is now strong enough, and we are ready to compensatethem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I know that there is still controversy about the effects of AgentOrange. There may always be controversy, just as there may always be controversyabout the Vietnam war itself. But the legislation that I have introducedis an attempt to end the controversy, and put the division of the Vietnamwar behind us. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am not saying that the studies should stop. Studies on Agent Orange,on dioxin and on cancer should continue. But the Ranch Hand study willnot be complete until the year 2002. And we cannot ask Vietnam veteransto wait any longer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CDC has told us that they cannot complete their study on AgentOrange, because they cannot measure the levels of dioxin in the blood ofVietnam veterans. That is perhaps not surprising, since in many cases 15to 20 years or more have passed since the exposure of Agent Orange in Vietnam.But that does not mean that there are no lingering health effects, no diseasesor damage caused by that exposure. Let us be clear on that point. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, Vietnam veterans deserve to be told the truth. I believethat just as important as compensation itself is the simple recognitionand admission of the fact that Vietnam veterans and their children aresuffering_from cancers, tumors, birth defects and other conditions linkedto Agent Orange. It is time that we admitted that fact as a nation. Vietnamveterans do not want any special dispensation or special treatment. Theysimply want the same treatment that has been accorded to every other groupof veterans under the law. Where there is a medical condition caused bymilitary service, there should be compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Perhaps all of us today will not agree on whether Agent Orange causedall of the diseases I have listed. But the evidence of the Vietnam ExperienceStudy and other studies clearly shows that those diseases are associatedwith service in Vietnam. And that is really the critical point. If a veteranis suffering today from a disease caused by his service in Vietnam, thenhe should be compensated. It is the way the system is supposed to work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, I am deeply dismayed by the attitude of this Administrationon the issue of Agent Orange. As with so issues, the rhetoric is out oftouch with the reality. They tell us that Vietnam veterans are ``nationalheroes''. But they continue to turn a deaf ear to Vietnam veterans whoneed help.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The VA continues to tell us that only chloracne, a skin disorder,is linked to Agent Orange exposure. Only a handful of veterans have beencompensated even for this disease. Meanwhile, the VA itself only reviewedseven out of more than a thousand studies relating to Agent Orange beforepromulgating its regulations on the subject. And at the same time, theycontinue to tell us that ``more studies are needed''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We've heard this before, Mr. Chairman. We heard it on atomic veterans.We've heard it on acid rain. We've heard it on toxic wastes. You were aleader in California, Mr. Chairman, on the issue of toxic wastes. You tooka courageous stand in 1986 in support of Proposition 65, the toxics initiativein California, which would ban herbicides and pesticides very similar intheir effects to Agent Orange. You have been a leader on environmentalissues. And we are dealing with the same issue here.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We know what the Administration's record has been on those issues.We know what the OMB's record has been. A study released a year ago bythe Harvard School of Public Health and Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, whichwas commissioned by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told us thatthe Office of Management and Budget ``has delayed, impeded, and thwartedGovernmental research efforts designed to answer public demands for informationon serious public health questions''_including Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">They concluded that ``Conditions imposed by OMB during its paperworkreview of a proposed NIOSH study of New Jersey and Missouri dioxin workershave substantially delayed the initiation of this study, will substantiallyincrease contracting costs by more than $270,000, and may even totallyblock the completion of this important study.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We know some of the reasons for this stonewalling and foot-dragging.They are afraid of the cost. They say it will cost too much money to compensateAgent Orange victims. They are afraid of legal liability. And they don'twant to admit that they were wrong.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We heard all those same arguments in the debate over atomic veterans.And we rejected them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">You put it best, Mr. Chairman, in the debate on the Senate floor lastmonth on compensation for atomic veterans. You said, and I quote:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I am aware of opposition to this bill from the administration andMembers of this body who fear that H.R. 1811 will set a ``dangerous precedent''for other groups * * * to press for presumptive compensation. They usethe fiscal </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">argument that the Federal Government will be held liable for millionsof dollars in claims it is in no position to pay. Mr. President, this isentirely beside the point. The point is that American veterans may be sufferingfrom the ill effects of radiation they incurred in the line duty to ourNation. If there is a reasonable chance that their claims of service connectionhave some scientific basis, it is incumbent upon Congress to give themthe benefit of the doubt. Mr. President, it is not our job to find excusesto deny benefits to deserving individuals. It is not our place to rejectcompensation for atomic veterans solely on the basis that such action mayopen the door for other would-be claimants to seek compensation. If atomicveterans deserve compensation, they should be granted compensation.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, I agree with every word you said in that debate. I supportedyou in that debate and I voted with you I would only add that the samewords apply exactly to the issue before us_If Agent Orange veterans deservecompensatoin, they should be granted compensation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I am as sensitive as any member of the Senate to questions of cost.We have estimates from CBO that our bill will cost about $100 million ayear for five years. That seems like a reasonable amount to me in lightof the VA's budget for fiscal year 1988 of $28 billion dollars.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But if there are better ways, more cost-effective ways to structurea bill, I am open to them. I am ready and willing to work with you andthis committee to craft any legislation which will provide fair compensationto the victims of Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But let us do it this year. Let us do it now. It has already beenover 25 years since the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam started in1962. It is already 13 years since the last American troops left Vietnam.And it is already too late for many Vietnam veterans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, you have already heard today from Admiral Zumwalt. Ido not need to retell the agonizing story of the suffering caused to theZumwalt family by Agent Orange. And you will be hearing later today fromother victims of Agent Orange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All I can ask, Mr. Chairman, is that you and this committee listento those stories, and consider this issue in human terms. People are suffering.People are dying. That is why we are here. And we cannot be indifferentto that suffering.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Chairman, many Americans questioned the war in Vietnam. Not allof them supported it. But Vietnam veterans gave their country the benefitof the doubt. In fairness to them, and in memory of those who gave theirlives, I hope that we can give them the same benefit of the doubt. I hopethat we can find it in our hearts to do as much for them, as they havealready done for us.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thank you.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I would now like to introduce Chris Gregory.

It was years after science hadproven that radiation caused physical damage to the United States Armypersonnel from atomic testing before political consensus in this countryallowed those physically damaged from the testing to receive federal benefits.It was years after science had proven that smoking caused damage to thehuman lung before political consensus allowed for a warning to be printedon a package of cigarettes. Both science and politics are intertwined.At times, politics can confuse the facts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Certainly, the advocates of the issues surrounding Agent Orange shouldbe objective. Agent Orange, a defoliant used in Vietnam, was a mixtureof 2,4-D(2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid) and 2,4,5-T(2,4,5-TrichlorophenoxyaceticAcid). During the manufacture of 2,4,5-T it was contaminated by Dioxin(2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-P-Dioxin) or TCDD. Dioxin is a compound withmarked toxicity in some species of experimental animals. That finding hasled to a number of scientific studies. These studies have led to a publicdebate and continuing scientific controversy over whether Agent Orangeor its elements cause an increased risk of cancer in humans. Although therehave been a number of studies analyzing whether Agent Orange causes anincreased risk in cancer, there have been several studies recently whichhave been publicly debated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">People who contend that Agent Orange or its elements do not causeany increased risk in cancer point out that the Ranch Hand study, whichinvolved the United States Air Force personnel who handled Agent Orangein the aircraft, did not show any increased incidence of lymphoma (a typeof cancer). These advocates point out that the Dioxin content from bloodsamples of military personnel who were exposed to Agent Orange and a controlgroup who was not exposed indicates Dioxin (TCDD) medians were virtuallythe same. These advocates argue that although the recent study done bySheila Hoar (Journal of the American Medical Association, September 5,1986, Volume 256, No. 9) suggests exposure to 2,4,D increases the riskof cancer, the Kansas farmers used in the study were also exposed to otherherbicides and, therefore, those other herbicides may be the cause of thecancer not 2,4,D.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The advocates arguing Agent Orange or one of its elements causes cancerpoint out that some of these same studies demonstrate an increased riskof cancer from Agent Orange and the Ranch Hand study is not of significantscientific value. Although the Ranch Hand study reported no deaths dueto lymphoma, there were only 1,247 personnel in the study, a statisticallyinsignificant number since less than one such death from lymphoma wouldbe expected. Dr. Arnold Schecter with the Department of Preventive Medicne,Clinical Campus at Binghamton of the State University of New York, urgedthat Dioxin (TCDD) be measured in Vietnam veterans in 1980 and 1984 notingthat Dioxin levels in the veterans would decrease with time. Dr. Schecterpointed out then that eventually heavily exposed veterans will carry levelsof Dioxin that are indistinguishable with the general population, and opportunitiesmay be lost to learn about the toxicity of this material in humans andto compensate appropriately those veterans who have or will suffer Dioxin-inducedinjury. Dr. Schecter has analyzed the human fat tissues of the Vietnamesein Vietnam </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">and demonstrated that the tissue samples taken in Ho Chi Minh City(formerly Saigon_whose surrounding area was heavily sprayed with AgentOrange) showed elevated levels of Dioxin (TCDD) characteristic of AgentOrange, in comparison with tissue samples taken in Hanoi (which was neversprayed with Agent Orange). Theodore Colton, ScD., of the Boston UniversitySchool of Public Health, in reviewing Sheila Hoar's study (Journal of theAmerican Medical Association, September 5, 1986, Volume 256, No. 9) foundthat the case control study in Kansas reported by Hoar has importance beyondits population of agricultural workers and adds to the accumulating bodyof evidence concerning the health effects associated with herbicide exposurein Vietnam. The Hoar study indicated that Kansas farmers exposed to herbicidesmore than twenty days per year had a six-fold increase of non-Hodgkinslymphoma (cancer) relative to non-farmers. Frequent users who mixed orapplied the herbicides themselves had an eight-fold increase risk for non-Hodgkinslymphoma. The strongest evidence to date suggesting that 2,4,D, one ofthe elements of Agent Orange, causes cancer is the Hoar study funded inpart by the National Cancer Institute. Sheila Hoar points out that althoughthere has been criticism of the study questioning the specificity of theassociation with 2,4-D with some contending that other herbicides the Kansasfarmers used were also associated with excess risk of cancer, she standsby the original interpretation of the data. Her study analyzed each herbicideand insecticide type separately and controlling for the effects of 2,4,Dand with the exception of some risks associated with Triazin, the excesslymphoma (cancer) was associated with 2,4,D. The Hoar study does providesupport for concluding that non-Hodgkins lymphoma (cancer) that arisesin Vietnam veterans is caused by one of the elements (2, 4, D) in AgentOrange, particularly if there is evidence of direct exposure to the herbicide. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be remembered that not very many months ago a $180,000,000suit was settled between the Vietnam veterans and the chemical companieswho produced Agent Orange. Proponents for the chemical companies arguedthat it was simply a nuisance suit that was settled for a small amountto generate some public relations value. It is doubtful that the chemicalcompanies would have settled for any amount if their attorneys advisedthem that the companies had absolutely no legal or financial exposure.Regrettably, at the time the Vietnam veterans settled the $180,000,000suit, the evidence of the Hoar study showing an increased risk of non-Hodgkinslymphoma when Kansas farmers were exposed to 2, 4-D was not available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Is there more evidence that there is an increased risk in cancer withexposure to Agent Orange or its elements in the future? The Center forDisease Control has been conducting epidemiologic studies of the healthof Vietnam veterans that has three major components: the Vietnam ExperienceStudy, the Agent Orange Study, and the Selected Cancers Study. The VietnamExperience Study will evaluate the possible health effects of the generalVietnam experience. The Selected Cancers Study will evaluate the risk ofcontracting soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. TheAgent Orange Study will evaluate the health effects of possible exposureto Agent Orange.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are a number of problems that have been encountered in thesestudies attempting to determine if Agent Orange or its elements cause anincreased risk of cancer in humans. There has been difficulty with theseAgent Orange studies resulting from the unexpected failure to identifylarge numbers of clearly exposed veterans. There has been the questionof whether it is possible to identify sufficient numbers of individualswho have had sufficient exposure to Agent Orange that has the biologicplausibility of producing adverse health effects. No threshold level hasyet been determined </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">for the health effects of Dioxin (TCDD) on humans. There have beenAgent Orange exposure study difficulties due to the inability to documentexposure from existing military records. There has been the attempt tovalidate the study of military records information based on estimates ofthe likelihood of exposure of Agent orange with blood evaluations of theDioxin (TCDD). Recent results of these Dioxin evaluations show there areno differences in Dioxin levels between Vietnam veterans and a group notexposed to Agent Orange. Therefore the White House has decided that thisstudy should not proceed since the information suggesting Agent Orangeexposure in military personnel cannot be confirmed by the blood tests checkingfor Dioxin. (An additional problem in the analysis of the Agent Orangeand its elements in causing increased risk of cancer is that to date thereare inadequate tests for the evaluation of 2, 4, D carcinogenicity in experimentalanimals.) the overall results will not have to rely on the Vietnam ExperienceStudy and the Selected Cancers Study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the first week of September, 1987, the results of the largest mortalitystudy of Vietnam veterans yet was released, finding that former Marineground troops died of lung cancer and certain lymph cancers (non-Hodgkinslymphoma) at a significantly higher rate than Marines who did not servein the war. This study, conducted by the Veterans Administration, examineddeaths among 49,920 Marine and Army veterans who served as ground troopsin Vietnam. The study stated exposure to Agent Orange was suspected thoughthere were other possible causes. This Veterans Administration study suggestsfurther what two civilian studies (Hoar study and Hardell study) have suggestedbefore that there is a link between these cancers (lymphoma) and AgentOrange or its elements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The scientific and the political battle as to whether or not AgentOrange or any of its elements caused an increased risk of cancer in theVietnam veteran continues. Perhaps the ultimate political question maybe, ``Has there been sufficient scientific evidence of the adverse effectsof Agent Orange or its elements for the Vietnam veterans who were exposedto those elements to receive some compensation?''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In my judgment, the Hoar study clearly establishes the carcinogeniceffects of one of the principal elements used in the manufacture of AgentOrange. The recent Veterans Administration study clearly establishes Marinesexposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam suffer a higher than normal incidenceof cancer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As one who shares personal responsibility for the use of Agent Orange,I believe the time has come for this country to make some compensatoryamends.

But Jack has quite appropriately painted inwords the other side of the story.

An article appeared in the March 28, 1988, edition of Fortune magazinewhich listed the top 100 American made products. Of the 100 best, an aboveaverage 7 are manufactured in Kentucky. These seven include: Corning sunglasses,General Electric dishwashers and jet engine components, Kingsford charcoalbriquettes, Marlboro cigarettes, 3M post-it note pads, and Reynolds aluminumfoil. The seven Kentucky manufacturers listed in the article exhibit the futureof America as a competitive global leader while providing a rising standardof living. They also realize that our national security and the healthof our national economy will depend on the ability of U.S. industry tocompete both at home and abroad. The producers of the Kentucky Seven areto be commended for their drive and commitment to the preservation of Americaas a global economic leader. In commending my fellow Kentuckians for their outstanding contributionto the strengthening of Kentucky's ecomony, I do not want to overlook theircontribution to America's overall economic well being. Not only are thejobs they create important to their local communities, but most of theseproducts are also exported. I am convinced that our export performanceover the next several years will play a significant role in our nationaleconomic growth. The Kentucky Seven demonstrate that these unique productsof Kentucky are just as successful in our national and export market placein quality and performance as some or other better known products. Thepast and future success of our State and national economies will rely onthe spirit of determination, commitment to quality, and efficient mangementdemonstrated by these Kentucky products.

That's right, the quality of U.S. goods_so oftendeplored as fit only for the throwaway society that produced them_is improving.Says Dana Cound, chairman of the American Society for Quality Control,an international organization devoted to the quality-related sciences:``On virtually every front the quality of American products is better thanit has ever been on an absolute scale.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The image of American products is still that summed up by the commonEuropean attitude: ``You Americans don't make anything we want to buy.Or by the Japanese repairman who, when asked what was wrong with a garbagedisposal machine he was fixing, replied, ``It's American.'' Last year aRoper poll of West Germans found that only 6% of them considered the tagline Made in America indicative of quality. The the newspaper <T3>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</T3> salted the wound in an April editorialthat asked, ``Which American products can a sensible European buy? . .. American industry really ought to get more innovative to interest ourconsumers.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unfortunately, the pursuit of quality has rarely ranked high amongU.S. manufacturing objectives. Tom Peters, in <T3>Thriving on Chaos</T3>, quotes quality consultant W. Edwards Deming:``Henry Ford made great contributions, but his Model T was not a qualitycar.'' In the years after World War II, there was so much pent-up demandfor goods and services that U.S. consumers were often glad to take </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">what they could get. Says Alexander Trowbridge, president of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers and a former Secretary of Commerce: ``We wereoperating to some degree on a philosophy of planned obsolescence. In thatsort of world, quality takes a back seat. Ultimately we got hurt by it.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Today, with quality at the crux of global competitiveness, Fortuneset out to determine which American products can be considered the finestof their kind. Products were selected after consulting with quality experts,management consultants such as Arthur D. Little Inc., security analysts,academics, industry association representatives, Consumers Union, majorcustomers, and other knowledgeable observers of the global manufacturingscene.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To be included, an item had to be state of the art_that is, at theheight of innovation and technological advancement. It also had to be themost durable of its kind and provide good to great value for the pirce.In the cases of commodity items, where quality is tougher to judge, orof ties between competing products, the final selection was based on marketshare. The list turned out to be as heterogeneous as the society that manufacturersthe products: It is a mix of high and low tech, basic industrial and consumergoods.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Making distinctions between U.S. and foreign goods is often hard.The global marketplace is characterized by out-sourcing, joint ventures,and foreign subsidiaries (see Competition). Caterpillar and Xerox havejoint ventures in Japan, and Toyota builds cars in California arm in armwith General Motors. Steinway andamp; Sons makes pianos in Hamburg, WestGermany, and in Astoria, New York. By Fortune's definition, a Made-in-Americaproduct is assembled in the U.S. by a U.S. company and fabricated fromat least 50% domestic parts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The glossiest pages in the catalogue of America's best should be devotedto agricultural equipment, aerospace products, computers, and pharmaceuticals.The U.S. is the global leader in these industries, with many goods exemplaryfor their technological innovation and quality, and all four are big exporters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">American know-how also knows how to manufacture excellent medicalinstruments.

No one holds a monopoly on quality. Itis an attainable goal for every manufacturer. Says Stephen Cohen, co-directorof the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy and co-author ofManufacturing Matters: ``I don't believe quality is any cultural secret.I think there are learnable things to do to achieve it.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The best products are designed not so much to meet specificationsand fulfill customers requirements as they are to match or surpass customerexpectations. Steinway andamp; Sons likes to say it builds pianos to a standard,not to a price. The company refuses to skimp on materials, labor, and effortin the construction of a musical instrument that is as close to perfectionas the hand and cunning of man can make it. Though the Hamburg factoryputs mahogany and red beech in its piano rims, the New York factory usesthe denser maple to give the American Steinway a brighter, more powerfultone.

Cameron is betting there will be growing demand for the connectoras oil companies move farther offshore in the search for new oil fields.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Processed-food companies have always been extremely innovative aboutpackaging, not only to attract the consumer who wants convenience but alsoto win the fight for shelf space. Now that two-thirds of American householdshave microwave ovens, both Hormel and General Foods are bringing out newmicrowavable meals_called, respectively, Top Shelf and Impromptu. By virtueof packaging processes that pressurize, seal, and steam the meal in a plasticcontainer, the food requires no refrigeration and can sit on a shelf withoutspoilage for up to 18 months.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Innovation can occur by serendipity: In fact, it usually does. Engineersfrom 3M and Boeing, looking for aerospace applications for a new drag-reductioncoating, tested the material for the fun of it on rowing shells in PugetSound. The results were so impressive that last year the coating, inscribedwith tiny grooves that replicate sharkskin, was used on the hull of Starsandamp; Stripes in its successful bid for the America's Cup. Crew memberscredited the coating with increasing the yacht's speed two-tenths of aknot and cutting ten seconds off its finishing time. 3M now sells the coatingto sailors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Among the world's best-selling drugs are a pair of billion-dollar-a-yearU.S. entries for high blood pressure: Capoten from Squibb and Vasotec fromMerck. Capoten resulted from the research of Squibb scientists who noticedthat the venom of the Brazilian pit viper killed its victim by loweringits blood pressure. They found a way to synthesize the venom free of itsterminal side effects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. is world renowned in medicine and the applied sciences inpart because industry recruits the top international scientists, and manygo onto develop new products. American companies have historically ledthe world in the number of drugs introduced each year, and are especiallygood at converting research into prescription products. They maintain theiredge because they are willing to finance research and because they canraise capital for Randamp;D from venture entrepreneurs and the public marketand, like Merck, from the sales of successful drugs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Between innovation and production comes product design. That's wherethe engineer is supposed to build in ease of use and aesthetics. Historically,that's also the place where American manufacturers have cut corners tosave money. Companies that do design products properly consult the consumerto find out how he uses the item before contriving the design. For example,Apply Computer organizes focus groups of five to ten users to get customercomments before and during the design stage. Apple calls the procedurea ``reality check.'' In the design process engineers also try to minimizethe number of parts required to make the item. The fewer the parts thesmoother the assembly process and the more reliable the final product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once the item is ready to move onto the assembly line, the qualityeffort takes on a different complexion. The hunt has already begun forthe best raw materials and the most dependable suppliers. Take the exampleof fly-fishing rods: Walt Carpenter, and artisan in Chester, New York,spends 30 to 100 hours making superb rods that sell for up to $1,500. Carpenteruses a bamboo called Tonkin cane (Arundinaria amabilis) from Southern Asia.As Peter Passell writes in The Best, ``Tonkin cane is not as light as graphite,but it is stronger . . . [It] imparts a very consisent, predicable feelsthat makes it the material of choice for expert flycasters.'' Levi Strausscontinues to produce 80% of its jeans from 100% cotton denim, a lightweightdurable fabric. Cone Mills, Levi's exclusive supplier of denim for thebasic 501 jeans, can weave the fabric with only four or five defects per100 square yards_a ratio Cone's foreign competitors cannot match.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upgrading quality on the factory floor requires that manufacturersride herd on their suppliers to improve the parts they deliver. Faced withcompetition from Toyota, Tennant Co. (see box, page 48), which makes industrialfloor sweepers and scrubbers, enlisted the help of its suppliers to upgradethe parts. The company's purveyor of hydraulic cylinders reduced the numberof defective cylinders from 6.4 % of each shipment to 0.8%, and a supplierof small motors decreased his defect rate from 8.8% to 2.3%.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Once the parts are on hand, the assembly process must be done correctlyfrom start to finish, with little or no tolerance for the post-assemblyrepairs known as ``rework.'' Boeing employs a humdrum concept called ``systemintegration'' to build 747s that</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">should last about 20 years. Computer bar coding helps the companykeep track of 500,000 types of parts, ranging in size from a \3/16\-inchrivet to a 103-foot-long wing section, that arrive from some 1,600 subcontractorsin 44 states and 13 countries. Then workers aided by sophisticated softwaremake sure that all the parts fit together to form one 747 in a mammothfactory in Everett, Washington. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A.T. Cross urges production workers to toss off the assembly lineany pens or mechanical pencils they suspect are flawed. The company unconditionallyguarantees its products against defects and does repairs free for the lifeof the pen or pencil. Fewer than 2% of Cross writing instruments have everbeen returned for repairs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At other companies, like Xerox and Tennant, line employees chart theirdefect rates and set goals for the workers to reduce them. At Tennant,one assembly worker has been so successful eliminating problems in thefloor sweeper he puts together that the company stopped regular inspectionsof his machines three years ago. Quality-oriented manufacturers understandthat it costs less to make the product right the first time. Says PhilipCrosby, an independent quality consultant: ``I see few companies wherethe pretax profit is as big as the price of not conforming to specifications.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A tradition of craftsmanship endures in many smaller businesses. AtCrane andamp; Co. (see box, page 52) the borders on the sheets of stationeryare hand-etched, and the bows that hold the writing paper and envelopesin the box are still hand-tied. The world's best-tailored mink coats havetraditionally come from Manhattan's Seventh Avenue. The furriers, manyof them immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, use a secret solutionfor dresssing the skins. Then in a process known as ``letting out'' theycut, stitch, and stretch the pelts before sewing the long strips togetherinto a coat. Jill Vander Putten, head of fur design at the Fashion Instituteof Technology, explains that it takes years of apprenticeship to learnthese techniques. Says she: ``In Asia and Europe they don't have the necessaryexperience, but they are improving.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New standards of quality keep surfacing in manufacturing. What leadstoday risks obsolescence tomorrow. Author and consultant Tom Peters callsthis sad pattern the ``champ to chump syndrome.'' The color television,the video recorder, the computer memory chip, textile machinery_all areregrettable examples of products the U.S. created only to let the competitiveadvantage slip offshore. Xerox, once the uncontested leader in photocopiers,saw its world market share drop from 82% to 41% in six years as a resultof Japanese inroads into the copier business. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The acheivement of quality, the experts will tell you, must be anongoing process. Says Blanton Godfrey: ``Look how fast products are improving,both in technology and quality. There is not just maintaining the lead.You have to be on fast track, constantly improving at a good rate, or youwill be overtaken.'' To avoid that fate in the midsize part of the copiermarket where it still leads, Xerox today makes a habit of competitive benchmarking.Company engineers pull apart competing products to see how they are madeand then estimate the costs of production in a search for new, cheaper,and better ways to make their own copiers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even a product as basic as Levi's jeans has been adapted and improvedto stay competitive since its invention in 1853 by a Bavarian immigrantfor the miners in the California gold rush. ``Over the years we have madein excess of 20 fundamental changes in our basic jeans,'' says Peter Thigpen,president of the Jeans Co., a division of Levi Strauss. ``And I don't meanfashion change. I mean changes like increasing the overlap on the fly from\3/8\ of an inch to \5/8\ of an inch. There is a constant drive aroundhere for self-renewal.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Boeing, too, renews itself. Since the 747's introduction in 1970,its flying range has increased from 5,200 miles to 8,500. In January thecompany introduced the 747-400: sticker price, $120 million. By slashingthe number of lights, guages, and switches on the instrument panel from971 to 365 and by using digital electronics, Boeing was able to reducefrom three to two the number of pilots needed to fly the plane. The companyalso made the 747-400 some 13% more fuel efficient and added a six-footwinglet at the tip of each wing to help eke out an extra thousand miles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Factory automation is a popular response to the competitive pressuresof staying ahead, but by itself it does little to solve the quality problem.You just get the same quality articles more quickly. Says quality authorityArmand Feigenbaum of General Systems Co.: ``The notion of trying to achievequality leadership by managing through robots rather than through peopleis specious.'' Maintaining excellence boils down to managing_managing thetechnology, the labor force, and managers themselves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The commitment of the senior people to the quality process is unquestionedat the companies that make the best products. Executives field customercomplaints on hot lines, personally test the products, and meet at leastweekly to address quality issues. Quality becomes, in Feigenbaum's words,``an ethic.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The last ingredient for maintaining quality_and the single most importantone_is that sales-force bromide: Know your customer. There is a better-educated,more cynical buyer out there with little patience for poor quality. Hewants products that work the first time and is willing to pay for them.To respond to customers' changing needs and expectations, the manufacturermust be nimble. Flexible manufacturing helps. Companies like Deere andTennant can customize a product to a buyer's specifications. Evan a venerableproducer of commodity items like Levi Strauss knows it must keep up withits customers. The story of the copper crotch rivet on the 501 jeans isa case in point.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">According to company lore, copper rivets were added to the Levi jeanspockets and seams in 1873 to protect the pants from ripping under the weightof a miner's tools or, in the words of a Virginia City prospector, ``nuggetsbigger than your thumb.'' But when jeans became fashionable in the 1930s,the denim-clad smart set discovered that the rivets on the back pocketsscratched chair backs, the paint on the hood of a car, and anything elsethe wearer sat on. The back-pocket rivets were removed, but despite occasionalcomplaints from cowboys, the crotch rivet remained. In the last 1930s,Walter Haas Sr., the company president, went on a fly-fishing trip wearinga pair of 501s. One night he squatted close to the campfire, which heatedthe rivet. In the whooping war dance that followed, Hass the presidentmet Haas the customer. A week later the board of directors abolished thecopper crotch rivet by unanimous vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the copper rivet anecdote suggests, the achievement and preservationof product excellence take common sense, diligence, and attention to details_asthey always have. What is different today is that the pursuit of quality,whether in planes, pacemakers, percales, or pianos, is no longer voluntary.If U.S. industry expects to win still more customers and market share,it has no choice but to improve its products. For the customer, qualityis irresistible. For industry, it is essential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/> [S13MY8-1908]{S5849}Making It <ITAG tagnum="74">Making It Right the First Time</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1979, Tennant Co. received two pieces of life-threatening news.Word arrived at Minneapolis headquarters that a potentially fatal defecthad appeared in the motorized factory floor sweepers that it was exportingto Japan. The sweepers were chronically dripping oil. The second pieceof news was Toyota's announcement that it was bringing out a competingproduct. In an all-out effort to save its 40% North American market share,Tennant, the world's biggest manufacturer of floor maintenance equipment,embarked on an ambitious, by-the-book quality improvement program thatover the next few years upgraded its sweepers and scrubbers from good togreat. Today the company has 60% of the North American market and 40% ofthe world market; sales grew from $98 million in 1979 to $167 million lastyear.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">President Roger Hale started the process of upgrading the company'sgoods by consulting quality expert Philip Crosby. Arguing that the producthad to be made right the first time, Crosby recommended that the companyeliminate its rework area, where 18 of the most experienced mechanics fixedmistakes made during the assembly process. The repercussions of Crosby'sreform were enormous: Workers had to make fewer blunders and catch thosethey did make. In order to eliminate errors, management and workers, brainstormingin small groups, developed scores of new assembly procedures that changedthe shape of assembly lines and rerouted the delivery of parts. Employeeswere taught statistical process control, a method of monitoring defectsand setting goals to reduce them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The group that looked into the oil leaks discovered that the company'sengineers had ignored the latest hydraulics technology, and a number ofthe assembly workers had been improperly trained to put together the hosejoints. Worse, 16 different suppliers were delivering fittings and hosesmade to varying specifications. As a result, the parts didn't go togetherproperly. Once the workers had been retrained and the number of suppliersreduced, leaks_which averaged two per machine in 1979_occurred fewer thanone of every 18 machines by 1986. Says Roger Hale proudly: ``The leadershipon the quality program has come from the factory floor.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Tennant succeeded in protecting its leading market share and enhancingits reputation within the industry. Better yet, says Robert Maples, a securityanalyst with Piper Jaffray, ``improved product quality is largely creditedwith forestalling Toyota's expansion into the U.S. market.'' Morale hassoared. Murals of paddling loons, grouse, and jumping bass adorn what wereonce bare factory walls. The floors shine, and the workers gladly showoff their handiwork to visitors while chatting knowledgeably about qualitycontrol. Employees award each other teddy bears_known as Koala T. Bears_fortaking the initiative in problem solving and achieving quality goals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Every 18 months, to keep things in sharp focus, the company celebratesZero Defect Day with a magic show and other live entertainment. At theend of the all-day fete, the workers renew their pledge to do their workcorrectly. ``It sounds corny,'' ``says Maples, but the corniness works.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/>[S13MY8-1909]{S5849}Keeping th<ITAG tagnum="74">Keeping the Fires Lit Under the Innovators </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Around this time of year, the noonday temperature in St. Paul, Minnesota,is three degrees below freezing, so it seems an unlikely spot for a caldronof innovation. Nonetheless, new products bubble up at a rate of more than200 a year from the research labs that crowd Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing's435-acre St. Paul campus. Many of 3M's innovations are modest variationsof such ordinary but ubiquitous industrial and consumer items as maskingtape, coatings for highway reflectors, and sandpaper. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some 6,000 scientists and engineers are continually stirring the pot,primarily in chemistry and applied science. In all, the company makes some60,000 products that last year produced revenues of $9.4 billion, up 10%from the year before. Operations in 50 other countries accounted for 40%of those sales. Assisted by the ailing dollar, earnings rose 18% to $918million. In Fortune's annual survey of America's most admired corporations,3M most recently ranked No. 6_out of 306 entries. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">The company is often cited for its ability to keep innovation alivein a large, necessarily bureaucratic organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The man responsible for seeing that the fires don't go out is AllenF. Jacobson, 61, known as Jake, who joined 3M as a chemical engineer straightout of Iowa State University in 1947. In contrast with his popular predecessor,Lewis Lehr, Jacobson is strict and a little cold. He once rebuked the ministerat his Presbyterian church for preaching that one person's profit is anotherloss. Collaring the young man after the service, Jacobson informed himtersely that his remarks were ``not in line with our country's best econmicthinking.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While hardly the type to encourage the entrepreneurial whims of 3M'sresearchers, this Calvin has a dash of the Good Shepherd. To be sure thathis flock of innovators share their ideas, Jacobson keeps his organizationrelatively decentralized. Information flows to the top from clearly definedreporting relationships and lots of shoptalk. He says, ``You can't maketoo many of the decisions on the executive floor. You have to depend onthe people who are close to the market and the technology.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under Jacobson, 3M continues to codify many of the practices thatpreserve the innovative spirit of its scientists and engineers. Researchersare encouraged to spend 15% of their time pursuing pet projects that mighthave a payoff for the company down the road_a pastime they call ``bootlegging,''The stick behind that carrot is that 25% of each division's annual salesare expected to come from products developed in the prior five years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Small groups staffed with a researcher and a marketer push inventionsthrough the design and development stage. It takes an average of sevenyears from a product's invention to its successful introduction, althoughthe trek can be made in less. Though Post-it notes took six years, sometapes takes only one. Ultimately, 60% of the ideas wind up on the lab floor,but Jacobson wryly notes, ``Outsiders say we are very lenient in rewardingfailure.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One superior product fresh from the labs is the first videocassettetape for the Super VHS video recorder. The tape, which 3M hopes will bethe industry standard by the 1990s, improves picture resolution by capturing400 lines of broadcast information vs. the standard 230.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Besides coming up with new products, the labs are also supposed toprotect and extend the product line against the encroachments of competitors.A case in point: In 1980, 3M developed the first water-activated syntheticcasting tape used to set broken bones, but by 1982 eight other companieshad brought out copycat products. When 3M researchers discovered that someof these tapes were actually easier to apply than 3M's, they retreatedto their labs to develop and test 140 new versions in a variety of fabrics,before introducing the next year an improved product that was strongerand easier to use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1985, 3M's earnings declined 9.5% when the lofty dollar pummeledsales. Though Jacobson responded by cutting costs 35%, he spared Randamp;Dspending. Through this period, it actually rose from 4.5% of sales in 1980to 6.6% today, a figure roughly twice the U.S. average for manufacturers.Now the company is reaping the benefits of that investment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Every so often the caldron produces a witch instead of a winner. Recentlya line of air ionizers used to remove dust from the air in factory productionfacilities began leaking radiation. Though 3M maintains that the ionizerspose no serious health threat, it recalled them, fearing they would taintthe company's reputation. When asked about that reputation, Jacobson dismissesall the business buzzwords and phrases save innovation and the pursuitof quality. ``These are the tools for staying ahead in our increasinglycompetitive society,'' he says. For a man who goes one on one with God'sanointed, he practices what he preaches. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/>[S13MY8-1910]{S5850}A Real Tig<ITAG tagnum="74">A Real Tiger in the Paper Trade</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the weathered redbrick mills of Crane andamp; Co. in Dalton, Massachusetts,cotton pulp flows like watery scrambled eggs through tiled vats on itsway to becoming fine stationery and paper so durable the currency of theU.S. is printed on it.

Why cotton?Says Wayne Cronnell, director of quality control: ``It is a long, clean,stable fiber that produces an extremely durable sheet of paper.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The papermaking machinery is imported from West Germany or made bytwo local companies, Sandy Hill and the Jones division of Beloit. ``Webuy the Mercedes of the industry when we buy equipment,'' says Tom Sedgwick,superintendent of the stationery division. Only the finest water-solublepigments are used for the inks and dyes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finishing touches are done by hand. When it comes to painting theborders of the cards and stationery, 12 women workers gently spread outa stack of papers, making sure an even width of border shows on all thesheets before sponging on the ink. Says Sedgwick: ``You try and find mea machine to do this. Nothing can match the accuracy of the human handand eye.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="62"/>[S13MY8-1911]{S5850}100 Produc<ITAG tagnum="74"/>100 <T4>Products That America Makes Best</T4><ITAG tagnum="21">All-electric plastics injection-molding machine Cincinnati Milacron.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Aluminum foil Reynolds metals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Atomic clock Frequency Electronics, Hewlett-Packard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ball point pens A.T.

But they were also marked by major strides in theSoviet program, the successful return of the European Ariane rocket tocommercial service, a significant expansion of Japanese plans, the Sovietcommercial launch of an Indian earth-resources satellite, and a Chinese-Brazilianagreement to build such a satellite. The U.S. is back on the right roadbut faces a lot of traffic.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the businessman, engineer or scientist who wants to work in space,Moscow is increasingly the place to be. This was quite clear at the Moscowspace-futures forum (officially the International Forum on Cooperationin Space in the Name of Peace on Earth), held last October to commemoratethe 30th anniversary of Sputnik. Nearly 500 foreigners, half of them American,attended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The forum was the creation of Roald Sagdeev, director of the Institutefor Space Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Mr. Sagdeev, an energetic,charming man, brought the core of the world's space-science community toMoscow on the basis of his reputation, free travel and housing, and assurancesthat the forum would not be a propaganda mill.</ITAG>[S13MY8-1931]{S5852}exploitati<ITAG tagnum="89">exploitation and colonization</ITAG>[S13MY8-1932]{S5852}<ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Sagdeev and the evolving constellation of Soviet space organizationsemerged with enhanced credibility and closer ties with the West and developingcountries. While the vast bulk of the Soviet space effort remains militaryand public relations still plays a major role, the civilian component isgrowing in size and openness, and is increasingly seeking and finding Westerncooperation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Underlying Soviet activities is a perspective on space that encompasseslong-term exploitation and colonization as much as the exploration Americansstress. Soviet space programs benefit from direct military interest andthe general concentration of resources on physics and chemistry. Institutionalmomentum keeps programs and organizations alive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Over the past few years, the Soviets have chalked up very impressiveaccomplishments, including a permanently manned space station; the world'slargest booster; improved reliability and endurance of unmanned spacecraft;and the development of a space shuttle, which will soon be tested. Complementingthese accomplishments are wide-ranging plans to explore Mars, worthy ofAmerican visions 15 years ago. In the face of an economy backward in somany ways, the Soviets nevertheless are offering services and opportunitiesno other country today can match financially or technically.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets can offer delivery to orbit more quickly and less expensivelythan Western commercial vendors. The large investment in their space infrastructurehas given them a stable of reliable rockets (the Proton has had nine failuresin 105 launches) that, while technologically undistinguished, perform thebottom-line task of putting satellites in orbit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The shortage of Western capacity makes Soviet launchers attractive.A series of launch disasters, including the Challenger explosion, severelycurtailed Western access to space in 1986-87. The European Ariane launcherjust returned to commercial service. The U.S. space program will not eliminateits backlog of payloads until the early 1990s.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Want to launch a satellite quickly and inexpensively? Glavkosmos,the recently established civilian space agency, will charge roughly $40million for a payload that a Western company would charge $60 million for.It offers a range of boosters with safeguards to minimize the transferof technology from the West. The U.S. government has prohibited Americanuse of Soviet boosters, but two major satellite makers, General Electricand General Motors, are appealing the action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviet purpose in offering launch services is two-fold: To gainboth international prestige and hard currency. The Soviets can undercuttheir Western competitors because Soviet operating costs are significantlylower than those of American and European commercial boosters, due to economiesof scale (in 1987 the Soviets launched 95 boosters, compared with 15 bythe rest of the world). Furthermore, the expense of launching a Protonrocket is in unconvertible rubles; the payment is in an international currency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Glavkosmos also offers small self-contained canisters carried on theMir space station. Formerly a NSAS monoply, these ``Getaway Specials''offer a low-cost way to conduct research in space. Payload Systems Inc.recently became the first American customer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Want a satellite picture so detailed it shows airplanes on the ground?Sojuzkarta sells photographs with a resolution of five meters, twice thatof France's SPOT and six times better than Landsat's thematic mapper. TheU.S. Geological Survey wants to use these pictures, but faces oppositionfrom other parts of the government. Sojuzkarta rang up its first of manyAmerican sales at the October forum, and an American firm soon may becomeits Western marketing outlet.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Want to explore Mars, an asteroid, or Saturn? Mr. Sagdeev's Institutefor Space Research and other research institutes are seeking foreign experimentsfor Soviet space probes. The Institute for Space Research coordinated the1986 Halley's Comet missions of several countries. European scientistsare working actively with their Soviet counterparts on Mars missions forthe 1990s. U.S. scientists, utilizing their expertise from the 1976 Vikinglanders, are selecting possible landing sites for Soviet and, possibly,American rovers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Scientists are revenue- (more accurately, research-) maximizing players.If the Soviet Union offers opportunities their home countries cannot match,the best and the brightest scientists world-wide will prefer to work withSoviet institutes. The long-term consequences for the American scientificand technical community would be devastating.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. has three options. It can ignore, compete with, or cooperatewith the Soviet space program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Competition has long been tacit American policy. Continuing this approach,the new space policy announced in January will put the U.S. back on solidcompetitive ground by emphasizing easier access to space and the developmentof basic technologies for working in space.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But while competition is a viable strategy, the U.S. will maximizeits return with selective cooperation. Cooperation requires shared interests,knowledge of each other's activities, and political support. The U.S. governmenthas a shaky record on the last. It unilaterally canceled a joint U.S.-Europeansolar probe a few years ago, and now an unseemly brawl has broken out betweenthe Defense Department and NASA over foreign participation in the spacestation.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I risetoday to bring the death of Tabatha Foster to the attention of my Senatecolleagues. Tabatha captured the hearts of Americans everywhere when, atthe age of 3, she underwent a five-organ transplant. Her fighting spirithelped her overcome numerous surgeries and infections and served as aninspiration to all of us who have closely followed her battle for a healthylife.Even when very ill, she always had a smile on her face. She would completedifficult tests and resume her laughter. While this remarkable courageendeared her to all of us, her greatest impact was on those who took careof her for the last 3 years. As one of her nurses said, ``She had beenthrough so much, but everybody thought that if anybody could make it Tabathacould. She was a fighter. There was a lot times while she was here theywould come and say `This is it_she's not going to make it through this.'But she would pull right through. * * *  One thing that pulled us to herwas the fact that she just seemed to take everything in stride.''Tabatha was even responsible for uniting her hometown of Madisonville.People from throughout the community have rallied to help her cause.President Reagan, who contributed toward her medical expenses, commentedWednesday night that he and the first lady were saddened to hear abouther death. He said, ``Many Americans were drawn to her because of her courageousbattle against birth defects.''However, Tabatha's enduring legacy is the benefit derived from her strugglesby the medical community. The information gained from her plight will helpdoctors in trying to save patients with the same congenital defect in thefuture. It is good to know that her experimental transplant may bring comfortand hope to a family that may soon face the same crisis.Mr. President, I know that all of my colleagues in this body will joinme in sending our most heartfelt condolences to Tabatha's family.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S13MY8-1938]{S5853}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1939]{S5853}ARCTIC NAT<ITAG tagnum="81">ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE</ITAG>[S13MY8-1940]{S5853}ROTH<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. ROTH.

The record at Prudhoe Bay proves wehave been good stewards of the land.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But among the findings of the report is that the quality and the quantityof North Slope freshwater was damaged more frequently and more severelythan expected by sedimentation, erosion and oil spills associated withthe pipeline and with Prudhoe Bay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Meanwhile, unexpected expansion of oil production facilities intothe Arctic Ocean damaged marine water quality, the report said.

The stories ofJack London and the explorations of Peary and Amundsen have left us withimages of a bleak, inhospitable wilderness. But though the climate is harsh,the native Inuit (Eskimos) have lived there for thousands of years, relyingon mammals, birds, and fish to supply their needs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, exploration and development of the oil fields has brought changeto the Arctic, and intense public debate focuses on the environmental effectsof industrial activity along the North Slope. The issue of whether developmentshould occur in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, is nowbefore Congress. EPA's position remains one of impartial analysis, basedon the best available scientific evidence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Experience with oil development in the Arctic is not very extensive.Prudhoe Bay opened in 1968 and the National Petroleum Reserve west of theColville River was explored in the 1940s and 50s. Based on this limitedexperience, the environmental impacts of new oil development have beenreduced. Nonetheless, considering the value of arctic life, we must becautious. Continued inquiry into the intricacies of arctic ecology is stillthe only prudent course. Central to this debate is the structure of thearctic ecosystem as a whole.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The biological zones encountered as one moves north through Alaskaare like those one finds while climbing a mountain: first the tall evergreens,then dwarf trees, then hardy alpine shrubs, such as heather, and finallygrassy meadows and lichens. Geographers define the Arctic to include thetreeless areas of the far north. This area called tundra comprises aboutfive percent of the earth's land surface. The tundra extends in a nearlyunbroken band across the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America.Plant and animal species are remarkably similar throughout this vast realm.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The North Slope of Alaska covers more than 200,000 square kilometersand embraces three major physiographic regions: the Brooks Range, the foothills,and the coastal plain. The Brooks Range is a rugged, glaciated extensionof the Rocky Mountain chain that has a mix of arctic and alpine tundra.Slopes and high ridges are sparsely vegetated, often only with lichens,and are similar to the polar deserts of northern Canada and Greenland.Lower, more protected slopes have dry-meadow communities dominated by mountainavens, a dwarf shrub featuring white, eight-petaled flowers. Near the valleybottoms are moist sedge meadows or shrub tundra with willow and dwarf birch.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Brooks Range slopes downward to foothills in the north. Theserolling hills of glacial deposits are covered by large stands of tussocktundra_compact tufts of cotton grass. Exposed ridges have alpine-like communitiessimilar to those of the Brooks Range. West swales and valleys feature willowthickets and sedge meadows. Further north is the coastal plain, a gentlysloping expanse of marine sediments dominated by grasslike sedge communities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The tundra is underlain by permafrost, permanently frozen soils upto 1,500 feet deep. A thick, insulating mat of moss rests on an activesoil layer often less than six inches deep. This thin soil, combined withthe short growing season and low summer temperatures, results in slow ratesof growth and decay. Thick layers of frozen peat develop, locking up thenutrients necessary for plant growth. Arctic vegetation thus responds dramaticallyto fertilization, and lush growth can be found near bird mounds and animalburrows in July and August.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are many lakes and rivers on the North Slope but most are tooshallow to support overwintering fish, and this limits the size of freshwaterfish populations. Species like whitefish and arctic char are found alongthe coast during the open-water season, but return to deep pools in freshwaterstreams or brackish river deltas to spend the winter. Only two major riversin the Northern American Arctic empty into the Arctic Ocean_the MacKenziein Canada and the Colville in Alaska. The mouth of the Colville forms alarge delta system with many freshwater and saline lakes and channels.A tremendous diversity of habitats supports large populations of overwinteringand breeding fish and some of the largest waterfowl and shorebird populationson the North Slope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Though the North Slope receives less than 10 inches of precipitationper year, low temperatures keep evaporation to a minimum, and the permafrostlayer prevents absorption into the soil. For this reason, flat or gentlysloping surfaces are usually saturated or flooded throughout the summer.The coastal plain becomes a vast wetland.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But the tundra is a dynamic landform. Extreme cold causes the groundto contract, much in the way that cracks form in a parched river bottom.Snowmelt then freezes in the cracks. The ice wedges down and out into thesoil to form the rims of polygons. Some drain and some combine eventuallyinto lakes. From the air, the land resembles a honeycomb.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The steep slopes of the Brooks Range also suffer frequent rock slidesand avalanches. In the foothills and coastal plains, frost churns the surfaceinto scattered patches and rings called frost scars or boils. The annualflooding during ice breakup inundates the tundra for up to two weeks ata time. Thermal erosion melts ice wedges, causing river and lake banksto slump, and converting wet, low-centered polygons into dry, high-centeredones.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Animal species have evolved a number of means to adapt to this ever-changingtundra environment. Immense herds of caribou and large flocks of waterfowland shorebirds arrive in the spring to take advantage of the rich wetlandsfor feeding and breeding, and then migrate south again as the season shifts.Some of the animals that remain for the winter either hibernate (groundsquirrels) or become torpid (bears). The few large herbivores (such asmusk oxen) and even fewer birds (such as ptarmigan) that remain activehave developed large body masses, thick insulation, and the ability tofeed through the snow. Lemmings, one of the most abundant herbivores inthe Arctic, build large nests and graze on old grasses and sedges underthe snow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Are popular depictions of the tundra biome as a fragile environmentcorrect or not? Tundra organisms are adapted to natural disturbances, buttheir recovery may take far longer than in temperate climes. Removal ordisruption of the insulating mat of vegetation causes the underlying permafrostto melt and can produce trenches that continue to erode for many yearsbefore natural restoration can occur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the immediate effect of removing the organic mat is to destroyexisting vegetation and hamper resprouting, a long-tem consequence is theloss of accumulated soil nutrients. It may take up to 10,000 years to replenishthese nutrients at current rates of accumulation. While the ecosystem asa whole can accommodate a certain degree of disruption, recovery of a specificsite may take centuries due to both the short growing season for tundraorganisms and their slow rates of growth. The total effect of many suchincidents over a large area is uncertain, but could be critically destabilizing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Much of the ability to local environmental stress derives from thelarge expanse of similar habitats that can be exploited and the existenceof nearby populations that serve as reservoirs for recolonization. Thereis great uncertainty as to the effect of destroying high-use or criticalhabitats.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This issue, of course, is central to the debate over oil explorationin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, site of the main calving area forthe famed Porcupine caribou herd. As development proceeds and the tundrabecomes increasingly fragmented, the recovery of local populations maybe hampered by the lack of neighboring populations. Moreover, what we knowof tundra biological change and accommodation is mostly based on our experiencewith plant communities. We know less about the long-term stability of wildlifeand of the biome as a whole, and even less about their synergies and interactions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The tundra ecosystem, then, can be seen as a naturally resilient system.We know that plant and animal communities have been able to adapt to theirharsh surroundings, but the slow pace of the tundra's biological clockconstrains its ability to deal with the sudden intrusions of industrialdevelopment. The time periods necessary for regeneration of plant communitiesmust be considered when making any resource management decisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We must move carefully, a step at a time, until we know for certainwhat we are doing and what our impact will be over the centuries to come.Once lost, our natural heritage can never be regained. As stewards of theearth, we must protect it for the enjoyment of generations to come.andCx.1;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Source: EPA Journal, Vol. 14.

Abe Stolar is still there.The facts of his case are all too familiar, but they merit review. Therehave been numerous occasions when it seemed that the Soviets would allowthe Stolars to leave, only to have their hopes cruelly dashed.Abe, his wife, Gita, and their son, Michael reveived permission to emigratein 1975. After shipping all their belongings to Israel and selling theirapartment, they went to Moscow International Airport to catch their flightto freedom. But, at the last minute the family was turned back on the pretextthat Gita Stolar had access to state secrets in her job as an analyticalchemist.In November 1985, the New York Times published the names of 10 familiesthat had been granted permission to leave the Soviet Union.

Michael hasmarried Julia Shukhrat, and they have two children, Sarah and a new babyborn April 29.The latest obstacle preventing the Stolars from leaving is that Julia doesnot have permission from her mother. Julia has been refused twice on thisbasis, most recently in March, and there is little chance that her motherwill change her mind. Julia and her mother have not been in contact for8 years.The Soviets have at times waived the procedure for parental permission,in particular in a number of higher level cases, and I have asked themto do so again. They have yet to respond to that request.I am encouraged that the number of Soviet Jews allowed to emigrate hasincreased in recent months, but I must ask: What possible reason can therebe for the authorities to break up this close-knit family?Mr. President, I draw your attention to a Dear Colleague which I and Senator<T4>Simon </T4>have circulated on behalf of this family, and I ask my colleaguesto add their signatures to the attached letters to President Reagan andGeneral Secretary Gorbachev. The letters express the hope that when PresidentReagan returns from his 4-day meeting with Gorbachev, he will not onlyreturn with a better understanding of the Soviet Union: We hope that thePresident will return with Abe Stolar and his family. It is time to bringAbe Stolar home.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S13MY8-1961]{S5856}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1962]{S5856}ABE STOLAR<ITAG tagnum="81">ABE STOLAR_PART V</ITAG>[S13MY8-1963]{S5856}SIMON<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to continue the storyof Chicagoan Abe Stolar and his long quest to leave the Soviet Union andsee the city of his birth again. Yesterday, I recounted the difficultyhis son, Michael, and daughter-in-law, Julia, had in trying to get marriedand to have their marriage be recognized by the Soviet authorities. Today,I wish to discuss what happened the last time there was a summit.For 10 long years, the Stolars fought to get out. Finally, in 1985, thelong campaign proved successful. Rumors began circulating the Stolars werefinally going to receive permission to leave. However, the unofficial wordcame through that they would have to leave Julia behind. As I mentionedyesterday, the Stolars refused to consider leaving the Soviet Union withoutthe entire family. They stuck to their refusal to leave and it finallyseemed that their tactic was going to succeed.In November 1985, the Soviets officially informed the United States Governmentthe day before the first Reagan-Gorbachev summit that the entire familyof four was being allowed out. The Stolars were included on a list of 10difficult cases being resolved as a summit gesture. As time passed, itbecame obvious that the Stolars were not leaving. Unfortunately, the Sovietshad no intention of letting the Stolars go. The Stolars remain in the SovietUnion, waiting and hoping for the freedom that is rightfully theirs.andCx.1;</ITAG>[S13MY8-1964]{S5856}F <ITAG tagnum="66">F </ITAG>[S13MY8-1965]{S5856}STAFF MEMB<ITAG tagnum="81">STAFF MEMBER BECOMES NEW GENERAL MANAGER OF BLAIR HOUSE </ITAG>[S13MY8-1966]{S5856}DOMENICI<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, 38 years ago my good friend, Pete Cenarrusa,was elected to the Idaho House of Representative and has been serving thepeople of Idaho ever since. In fact, Pete was the speaker of the IdahoHouse for three terms and for the last 20 years has served with distinctionas Idaho's secretary of state.Probably no one in Idaho public office epitomize Idaho's pioneer spirtand the opportunity for growth and success than Pet Cenarrusa.

Those of we who know him well also are quick to recognizethat his success has been complimented by the talents of his lovely wifeFreda.Pete's successful career was recently highlighted in an article which appearedin the Idaho Statesmen which I take pleasure in sharing with my colleagues.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Statesman article entitled``Cenarruse: Basque Heritage Shaped Life, Political Views'' the printedin the Record. The article follows:</ITAG>[S13MY8-1969]{S5857}CENARRUSA:<ITAG tagnum="74">CENARRUSA: BASQUE HERITAGE SHAPED LIFE, POLITICAL VIEWS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Caldwell</T4>._When Pete Cenarrusa was a boy herding sheep on his father'sranch near Carey, he never dreamed that one day he would serve in the Legislatureand eventually become secretary of State.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Now, posing in a red beret for a photographer in his office at theStatehouse in Boise, Cenarrusa, who turned 70 last month, talks about theoffice he's held for 20 years and a heritage rooted in the Pyrenees ofnorthern Spain.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Quick to laugh, a man who gaves the impression that he knows wherehe's been and where he's going Cenarrusa remembers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">His father was 17 years old when he arrived in the Carey area in 1907.His mother was 23 when the arrived in 1914. Both had left the Basque provinceof Vizcaya for a start in America.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The elder Cenarrusas reared five children, and all learned the Basquelanguage. ``It was the first language I learned at home.'' he said.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And Cenarrusa attributes his conservative Republican political philosophyto his father and mother. ``I grew up that way, being conservative,''hesaid. ``My parents were very frugal. My mother wouldn't waste a thing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"/><ITAG tagnum="21"/><ITAG tagnum="21"/><ITAG tagnum="21">``They found great opportunities in this country, and they took advantageof those opportunities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``The Basques have a great competitive spirit,'' he said. ``They'llcompete at anything and try to excel, no matter what it is_herding sheep,lifting weights, jumping, working.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the political realm, Cenarrusa began competing in 1950. He waselected to the House of Representatives and served for 17 years, includingthree terms as speaker. He was appointed secretary of State by Gov. DonSamuelson in May 1967, after Edson Deal died of a heart attack. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cenarrusa won his first re-election bid in 1970. He has hardly hada serious challenge since then.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Before politics, there was the Navy and World War II, and before thatteaching high school. Cenarrusa was a Navy pilot from 1942 to 1946 andis a retired major in the Marine Corps Reserve. He holds a bachelor ofscience degree in agriculture from the University of Idaho, where he wasa member of the school's first national intercollegiate championship boxingteam.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">From 1940 to 1941, he taught chemistry and algebra in Cambridge, GlennsFerry and Carey, and was a boxing and football coach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``After Pearl Harbor, I enlisted to beat the draft,'' he said, laughing.``I remained stateside during the war.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">But if his days of piloting Navy-Marine Corsair fighter planes areover, his passion for flying remains. When Cenarrusa talks about flying,it's clear he does so with a certain passion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I've been flying for 45 years,'' he said. ``I have flown 2 millionmiles without an accident. I have over 16,000 hours of flying time.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cenarrusa didn't even have an accident with an airplane until May,when wind blew a truck into his plane's tail.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">He said he indulges his passion for flying whenever possible, includingweekends that often see him flying to the family ranch at Carey to talkwith the ranch's manager, or simply to be on the rangeland and mountainsof his home. The ranch can be reached from Boise by plane in 42 minutes,he said.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I haven't gotten the rancher out of me,'' Cenarrusa said. The ranchingoperation includes 6,000 deeded acres and about 18,000 acres of Bureauof Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and other land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cenarrusa, whose annual salary is $45,000, said his office has seenmany changes since the '50s, as has the rest of state government. In 1951,the state's general fund budget for government, including education, was$40 million for two years. This year's general fund appropriation is $657million.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">He has a staff of 25. Duties of the office include filing articlesof incorporation and bills passed by the Legislature, and the administrationof election laws.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Cenarrusa as secretary of State, is also a member of the Land Boardand the Board of Examiners and is the state's chief election officer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Asked what he has learned about himself as a 37-year veteran of publicoffice, Cenarrusa said, ``I've sometimes learned from my mistakes.'' Pressedfor details, he said, ``I can't think of any (mistakes) right now,'' andlaughed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Later he said he had thought of at least one mistake: ``Smoking inthe military, that's one of the mistakes I made, but I quit in time.''He laughed again.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Will he seek another four-year term in 1990?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I guess I should say, `Never say never,' ' he said. ``I think I'lllook at running again.''andCx.1;</ITAG>[S13MY8-1970]{S5857}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-1971]{S5857}JACK LAVIN<ITAG tagnum="81">JACK LAVIN</ITAG>[S13MY8-1972]{S5857}SYMMS<ITAG tagnum="10">andCx.1; Mr. SYMMS.

At onepoint, he leaped from one Forest Service outpost to another three yearsin a row.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Some of the moves were pretty traumatic for my children,'' Lavinrecalls, smiling again. ``My second son, Matt, went to three differenthigh schools in three years.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indeed, Lavin's travels might rival those of an Air Force career man,but he was always doing what he wanted, fulfilling his lifelong dream tobe a forest ranger.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I was born in Philadelphia, and I remember that my family movedfrom a wooded area to a developed area </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">when I was 8.

I've always wondered aboutthat.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two years in Liberia was enough for Lavin. He wanted to return tothe United States and fulfill his dream of being a forest ranger. But hehad a military obligation to fulfill first.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Welcome back, Jack.

Trained as an electrician, he was put to work repairing anti-aircraftmissiles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1955, Lavin started to chip away at his dream, launching his ForestService career with the Targhee National Forest as an assistant rangerof the Island Park District.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It was the beginning of an extended love affair with the high countrysurrounding the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``That's some of the greatest country in the world,'' Lavin says,smiling at the thought of standing atop a 13,000-foot-plus peak, such asthe Grand Teton.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two years later, Lavin leaped over the Lemhi and Lost River rangesand settled in the Sawfooth Valley. He served as a district ranger, basedat the foot of Fourth of July Creek on the west flank of the White Clouds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``We used to wake up every morning and look across the valley at theSawtooths,'' he said. ``Never got tired of that view. * * * What a greatplace to raise kids.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Lavin's two girls, the Lavins' third and fourth children, wereborn in the Hailey Medical Clinic, upstairs from the drugstore. The twoolder children were still younger than 5.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Forest Service plucked Lavin out of the Sawtooth Valley and placedhim in Twin Falls from 1962 to 1965. He next spent two years in Washington,D.C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1967, he was named supervisor of the Shoshone National Forest,based in Cody, Wyo. He was the ultimate forest ranger then, in commandof an entire national forest. And he was only 37.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``I don't think I was the youngest (supervisor) ever, but it was unusual,''he says. ``When I went to my first supervisor's meeting in Denver, it waspretty obvious that I was the youngest guy there.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Lavin blushed at the thought. But he had paid his dues. He was rewardedwith three more supervisory posts, at the Targhee, Toiyabe and Boise nationalforests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most Forest Service career employees can be broken down into disciplines.They say, ``Oh, he's a timber man.''

Tuna are highly migratory fish, moving throughbroad expanses of the ocean and in and out of the coastal waters of manynations. Because of their peripatetic behavior, the United States doesnot claim nor recognize jurisdiction over tuna beyond 12 <ITAG tagnum="80">miles from shore. By contrast, most other nations, including the Pacificisland nations, claim jurisdiction over all fish found within 200 milesof their coasts. As a result of conflicting juridical positions, tuna disputeshave erupted between the United States and several Pacific island nations.Vessels have been seized and retaliatory trade embargoes have been invoked,eroding our traditionally cordial relations with these countries. To furthercomplicate matters, the Soviet Union has exploited this situation to secureunprecedented fisheries agreements with some of the island nations.</ITAG>Responding to strategic and economic concerns, the United States initiatednegotiations with the 16 Pacific island nations in September, 1984. Talkswere directed toward developing a regional tuna licensing agreement. OnApril 2, 1987, the United States signed a fisheries treaty with the Pacificisland nations. The treaty subsequently was approved by the Senate andratified by President Reagan on December 21. I understand that the Departmentof State is now waiting to deposit the instrument of ratification, pendingenactment of implementing legislation. Thus, passage of S. 1989 will permitcompletion of the ratification process and allow the treaty to enter intoforce.The Tuna Treaty and related agreements contain three major initiatives.First, the treaty establishes a regional licensing system providing U.S.fisherman access to over 10 million square miles of productive waters inthe South Pacific Ocean. Second, cooperative procedures are specified forregulating fishing activities and enforcing treaty provisions. Finally,the United States agrees to provide an annual economic assistance packageof $10 million to the Pacific island nations for the 5-year period coveredby the agreement. I understand that these funds were appropriated and areavailable for the current fiscal year.I would now like to turn to the provisions of S. 1989. The language beforeus is an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the legislation introducedby my good friend from Louisiana, Senator <T4>Breaux.</T4> Representatives from the Department of Commerce, the Departmentof State and the tuna industry worked closely with the committee to resolveseveral minor concerns with the provisions of the bill as it was introduced.I would like to express the appreciation of the committee for the cooperationand assistance of these parties.A key element of this legislation provides for implementation of the licensingagreement contained in the treaty. The bill stipulates that licenses tofish in the treaty area will be issued by an administrator named by thePacific island nations. U.S. domestic authority is given to the Secretaryof Commerce to issue regulations and develop licensing procedures. Licensefees are set at levels specified by the treaty.S. 1989 also implements the domestic regulatory requirements set forthby the treaty. Vessel operators are required to carry observers and reportcatch information to the Secretary of Commerce. Violations of the treatyare made   <ITAG tagnum="80">violations of U.S. law. Domestic procedures for receiving complaints,conducting investigations and hearings, and producing findings concerningviolations are outlined. In addition, the bill defines and distinguishesbetween violations for which civil and criminal penalties may be assessed.</ITAG>To carry out the provisions of the treaty and the bill, S. 1989 authorizessuch sums as may be necessary, including appropriations of $350,000 forthe Department of Commerce and $50,000 for the Department of State. Inaddition, the U.S. tuna industry has agreed to fund a $250,000 programof technical assistance to the Pacific island nations each year.Tuna has become a staple of the American diet. In 1986, Americans ate over600 million pounds of canned tuna worth almost $900 million. In addition,the U.S. tuna industry is one of our largest and most important fishery-basedindustries. Tuna fishing and canning operations employ an estimated 18,000people in the United States. In 1986, the U.S. fleet landed 555 millionpounds of tuna valued at over $200 million. About 90 percent of the catchcomes from foreign or international waters. Thus, reliable access to tunaresources located in these waters is essential to the fleet's continuedexistence. Foreign competition, rising costs, environmental regulations,and vessel seizures have threatened this industry in recent years. Enactmentof this bill will help assure the continued viability of the tuna fleet.It will also permit tuna fishermen to pursue a livelihood without constantfear of foreign nation reprisals.The importance of S. 1989 goes well beyond the preservation of our distant-watertuna fishery. The Tuna Treaty represents a significant foreign policy achievementwhich should improve our relations with the island nations of the SouthPacific. Treaty implementation offers an opportunity to transform the presenceof the U.S. fleet in the South Pacific from a source of contention intoa resource for aiding development of the region. Completion of the ratificationprocess will restore a positive American presence to an area which historicallyhas been closely allied with the United States.Finally, Soviet efforts to exploit our strained relations with the islandstates and expand their influence in the region illustrate the area's strategicimportance. The island nations have a democratic tradition and, until therecent fisheries disputes with the United States, had strongly resistedSoviet overtures in the region. By restoring a positive U.S. presence,treaty implementation will remove an opportunity for Soviet penetrationin the South Pacific.Prompt action is needed to implement the treaty and complete U.S. ratification.I urge the speedy consideration and passage of S. 1989.[S13MY8-1988]{S5860}KERRYMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1989, the SouthPacific Tuna Act of 1988. This bill provides a reasonable proactive approachto a problem associated with the U.S. tuna fleet. It takes an active roletoward supporting our valuable tuna history and at the same time noticeableystrengthens our relations with many Pacific island states. I applaud andencourage passage of S. 1989 the implementing legislation for the Treatyon Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States andthe Government of the United States of America which the Senate unanimouslyapproved last fall.The U.S. State Department has worked long and hard to secure a solutionwhich grew out of problems encountered in 1982 and again in 1984 when twoU.S.-Flag tuna vessels were seized in the South Pacific. The dispute, overthe right to harvest tuna within the national economic, or resource zoneof the Pacific Island states has led to a rational and workable treatyand a development assistance program for Pacific island nations. The treatyestablishes a mechanism for regional fishing licenses, providing excellentfishing opportunities for the U.S. distant water tuna fleet.This pleases me for many reasons. First, it benefits a very important segmentof the U.S. fishing industry. Second, it opens up 10 million square milesof the South Pacific for tuna fishing in an area where porpoise schoolsare not used as a means to locate and harvest the tuna. In addition tolicense fees, the tuna industry will provide technical assistance to thePacific island nations valued at $250,000 a year for 5 years. The UnitedStates will provide a 5-year economic assistance package of $10 millionannual over a 5-year period. This positive action strengthens an alreadyhistoric interest by the United States in peaceful development of the SouthPacific region. This comes at a very appropriate time to an area whereother countries had been actively seeking bilateral fisheries agreementsin the wake of U.S. fisheries conflicts. I recommend immediate adoptionof S. 1989 which will allow our fishing industry access to rich tuna fishinggrounds in the South Pacific and provide a development program which willstrengthen our good diplomatic relations with our friends in the SouthPacific.[S13MY8-1989]{S5860}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I am in full support of S. 1989, a bill toimplement the Tuna Fisheries Treaty with certain Pacific island states.The South Pacific Tuna Act is vital to the continued fishing operationsof our U.S. tuna fleet.On November 6, 1987, the Senate ratified a historic multilateral fisheryagreement between the United States and 15 Pacific island nations: Australia,the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kirbati, theMarshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Nine, Palau, Papua New Guinea, theSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa. As a memberof the Foreign Relations Committee, I strongly supported ratification ofthis treaty, which strengthens our ties and improves our relations withthese important allies. A unique partnership between the Department ofState and the tuna industry brought about this agreement. I wish particularlyto compliment Under Secretary Edward Derwinski for his efforts in concludingthis treaty.Tuna is a wandering species of fish. The practical inability of any singlenation to manage fishing on the tuna resources of the world has led toregional cooperative organizations that seek to understand and conservethese important food resources. Unfortunately, however, disagreements havecontinued over which nations should benefit from the economic value ofthese tuna resources_those countries in whose waters the fish may, duringa portion of the tuna's migrations, be found or those nations whose vesselsare adept at catching these fish. The treaty settles this disagreementbetween our fleet and the Pacific island parties in a fair and reasonablemanner.S. 1989 implements the U.S. regulatory obligations under the treaty. Thebill is fully consistent with our obligations and is noncontroversial.Because the Department of State will not deposit our U.S. instrument ofratification until implementing legislation is signed by the President,passage of this bill is the only remaining action before the treaty goesinto force. Eleven of the other parties have already ratified the treaty.The U.S. ratification is all that is needed to bring the treaty into operation.[S13MY8-1990]{S5860}BREAUXMr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am certainly proud to have been the sponsorof this important legislation in the Senate which represents the productof a highly cooperative effort between our committee and the State Department.While I will not belabor the details of the legislation at this time becausethe bill has been the subject of much discussion on record in our committeethus far, I would just point out the time sensitivity and the magnitudeof the economic and geopolitical significance of this legislation. With the enactment of this legislation, the ``Treaty on Fisheries Betweenthe Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government ofthe United States'' will be ready to be put into force. All that will beleft is for the United States to deposit its interest instrument of ratification.Virtually all other procedures that are necessary for the treaty to enterinto force have already been completed. I think it is important to pointout that this demonstrates the high degree of cooperation by the variousisland nations in this effort, and the profound level of importance thesenations place on this treaty. It is now incumbent on the United Statesto clearly demonstrate its unwaivering commitment to this treaty by puttingthis legislation swiftly into place. I also expect our State Departmentto immediately confirm this commitment upon the enactment of this legislationby committing the necessary funds to implement the agreement. Few agreements bring such a breadth of economic and political benefitsto U.S. interests over such a large geographic area. With this agreement,the U.S. tuna industry will gain access to literally 10 million squaremiles of some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. Andwith this agreement, the United States will unequivocably establish itselfas a friend and partner in this strategically important area of the world.As you know, Mr. President, the Soviet Union has made certain successfuladvances into the south and central Pacific region with the establishmentof several bilateral fishing agreements with certain island nations. Fortunately_andthanks to the good work of our State Department and industry negotiators_Ithink most island nations now view this treaty as a desirable alternativeto further association with the Soviet Union. That is why it is so criticalthat the United States not delay any further its commitment to puttingthis treaty into force and to honoring its financial commitments made tothe island nations under this agreement. We must now send a clear messageto our island nation friends of our solid commitment to a long and mutuallybeneficial relationship. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues for their unanimous support for thiscritical legislation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is open to further amendment.

I ask unanimous consentthat the Senate adopt S. 1883 as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee.The purpose of S. 1883, Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, is to amendthe Trademark Act of 1946 to bring it up to date with present day businesspractices and realities. The legislation improves the act's protectionof the public from counterfeit, confusion and deception, increases thevalue of the Federal trademark registration system for U.S. companies,and removes the current preference for foreign companies applying to register.Mr. President, S. 1883 represents the first overall revision of the Federaltrademark statute, the Lanham Act, since the act was adopted in 1946. Manyof the revisions are substantive and will have a significant impact onU.S. trademark law. Others are of a technical nature, serving only to correctdeficiencies and inconsistencies in the Lanham Act's language. Importantly,none of the amendments contained in S. 1883 alter the stated purposes ofthe Lanham Act or conflict with Congress' intent when it passed the actmore than 40 years ago. In sum, S. 1883 modernizes the Federal trademarkstatute while preserving its balanced protection of business [trademarkowners] and the public [consumers].Mr. President, S. 1883, the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, representsthe culmination of thousands of hours of work over the past 2\1/2\ years.The bill is based on the results of a study conducted by the U.S. TrademarkAssociation's Review Commission. The Commission's comprehensive reviewof the policies and components of the trademark system included an exhaustivequestionnaire to the trademark community, extensive study of specific topicsby committees, and open debate at annual meetings. Hundreds of trademarkowners and practitioners, more than 50 organizations, government officialsin the United States and abroad, and eminent scholars in the fields ofconstitutional, commercial, trademark, and unfair competition law contributedtheir views. When the study was completed the Commission produced a lengthyreport of its findings and recommended legislative changes in the trademarksystem.S. 1883, as I introduced it on November 19, 1987, encompassed those recommendations.The Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks held a hearingon the bill on March 15, 1988, and heard testimony from trademark associations,individual trademark experts, and trademark owners such as Mrs.<ITAG tagnum="80">Fields Inc. and Frito-Lay, Inc. Following the hearing several improvementswere made to the bill. My colleagues, particularly my good friend fromUtah, Senator </ITAG><T4>Hatch</T4>, worked closely with me in an effort to perfect the bill.I commend my colleagues, particularly the cosponsors Senators <T4>Grassley</T4>, <T4>Heflin </T4>and <T4>Hatch </T4>for recognizing the importance of this legislation and workingwith me to move it in an expeditious manner. A substitute amendment wasunanimously approved by the subcommittee on April 13, 1988 and by the fullJudiciary Committee on May 12, 1988. The following outlines in more detail some of the specific provisions ofS. 1883: [S13MY8-2032]{S5868}A. Applica<ITAG tagnum="74">A. Applications Based on Intent-to-Use </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S. 1883 creates a system whereby companies and individuals may applyto register marks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the basisof a bona fide intent-to-use the mark in commerce. Presently, an Americancompany may apply to register a mark only after it has actually used themark in commerce. Conversely, a foreign applicant is not required to usea mark before applying for a U.S. registration if it files based on a foreignregistration or application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. adoption of an intent-to-use application system has several advantages.First, it eliminates the extreme uncertainty American companies face asthey invest in introducing new products and services. Second, it reducesthe advantage that foreign trademark owners now enjoy. Third, it makesunnecessary the contrived practice of ``token use'' as a means of meetingpre-application use requirements. Last, it brings United States law intogreater conformity with worldwide practice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed intent-to-use application system will supplement thepresent use-based system; applicant will be able to choose between filingon the basis of intent-to-use or on the basis of actual use. While theexisting use-based system would not change procedurally, all applicantswho allege use of a mark in commerce will be subject to a more stringentdefinition of use. This definition, which will eliminate the commercially-transparentpractice of token use as a means of creating trademark rights, will alsohelp to reduce the amount of ``deadwood'' on the register. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The intent-to-use system provided for by S. 1883 includes severalsafeguards against abuse. Among them: </ITAG>[S13MY8-2033]{S5868}1.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. All business must state their bona fide intent-to-use a mark incommerce on or in connection with all of the goods or services stated inan application for registration. </ITAG>[S13MY8-2034]{S5868}2.<ITAG tagnum="21">2. With the exception of marks for which application for registrationis filed on the basis of a foreign registration or    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">foreign priority date, no mark will be registered until it is usedin commerce on a commercial scale and then it will be registered only forthose goods or services for which evidence of this use is submitted.</ITAG>[S13MY8-2035]{S5868}3.<ITAG tagnum="21">3. After a mark is approved for registration, it will have to be usedwithin six months or the application will be abandoned. This six-monthperiod may be extended in six-month increments up to a maximum of fouryears. To obtain each extension, the applicant must file a statement ofits continued bona fide intention to use the mark and pay a fee.</ITAG>[S13MY8-2036]{S5868}4.<ITAG tagnum="21">4. To reduce substantially the risks of introducing a new productand the potential for conflict between trademark users, the date an applicationto register is filed (whether it is filed on the basis of use or intent-to-use)will constitute nationwide ``constructive use'' of the mark. This willgive the applicant priority rights over later users or applicants. Thisright of priority can not be enforced, however, until the applicant makesuse of its mark and obtains a registration. </ITAG>[S13MY8-2037]{S5869}B. Accurac<ITAG tagnum="74">B. Accuracy of the Federal Register</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The goal of the federal trademark registration system is the creationof a record which accurately reflects all marks that are actually beingused in the U.S. marketplace. S. 1883 includes several provisions devotedto this objective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Deadwood''. As a means of eliminating from the register those markswhich are no longer in use and thereby do not qualify for registration(i.e., ``deadwood''), the bill first reduces the term of a trademark registrationfrom twenty to ten years (a commensurate decrease in the renewal fee wouldaccompany this change).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, it imposes stricter requirements for maintaining a registration.During the sixth year of the term of a registration, the owner of a trademarkregistration will have to file an affidavit with the Patent and TrademarkOffice stating that the mark is in use on or in connection with all thegoods or services recited in the registration and will have to providespecimens or facsimiles evidencing that use. (These new ``section 8'' requirementsparallel those that are now required at the time a mark is renewed.) Thesechanges, along with the new definition of use for which S. 1883 provides,will enlarge the pool of available marks for business to adopt, use andregister.</ITAG>[S13MY8-2038]{S5869}C. Protect<ITAG tagnum="74">C. Protection of Famous Marks from Dilution</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S. 1883 creates a federal cause of action permitting the owner ofa registered mark, which is truly famous and has distinctive quality, toprotect the mark from use by others which unfairly capitalizes on the exceptionalrecognition and renown of the mark or which reduces or destroys the distinctivequality of the mark even if likelihood of confusion in the marketplace,the standard test of trademark infringement, cannot be proved. This newcause of action is highly selective; it protects only those federally registeredmarks that are most likely to be diluted through non-competing use. Itwill augment, not preempt, the twenty-three state dilution laws.</ITAG>[S13MY8-2039]{S5869}D. Unregis<ITAG tagnum="74">D. Unregistered Marks</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S. 1883 amends the language of section 43(a) of the Lanham Act toconform it to the expanded scope of protection it has been given by thecourts. In addition, the revised section makes misrepresentations (e.g.,false advertising claims) about another's products or services actionable(under present law, actions are limited to misrepresentations about one'sown products or services), and extends the remedies available in casesinvolving registered marks to cases brought under the section where noregistration is involved.</ITAG>[S13MY8-2040]{S5869}METZENBAUMMr. METZENBAUM. Mr. President, when the subcommittee considered S. 1883an amendment was adopted to delete from section 35(a)(1)(B) the phrase``or by omission of material information''. What was the subcommittee'sintent in making that deletion?[S13MY8-2041]{S5869}DeCONCINIMr. D<T4>e</T4>CONCINI. Mr. President, this deletion was made to respond toconcerns that it could be misread to require that all facts material toa consumer's decision to purchase a product or service be contained ineach advertisement. Currently the question of when section 43(a) reachesfailure to disclose information material to a consumer's purchasing decisionis an open question in the courts. Recent court decisions and commentatorshave suggested that omissions may give rise to a cause of action regardlessof whether any affirmative misrepresentations have been made. The committeedoes not condone deceptive advertising whether by affirmative misreprentationon material omission, and leaves to the courts the task of further developingand applying this principle under section 43(a).[S13MY8-2042]{S5869}RUDMANMr. RUDMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to engagemy colleague from Arizona, Mr. <T4>DeConcini, </T4>the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Subcommitteeon Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks, in a brief discussion of the billcurrently being considered by the Senate, S. 1883. It is my understandingthat this bill does nothing to change current law or practice regardingparallel imports, sometimes known as gray market goods.[S13MY8-2043]{S5869}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>That is correct. This bill, which revises trademarklaw, is not intended to address the issue of gray market goods or parallelimportation.[S13MY8-2044]{S5869}RUDMANMr. RUDMAN. One section of the bill adds a Federal dilution section tocurrent law. This provision provides protection for famous registered trademarksfrom unauthorized uses which materially reduce the distinctiveness of themark. The Senator's introductory floor statement cites the example of asituation where a mark  such as Kodak is used for pianos, or Buick is usedfor aspirin. I presume that this is still the type of situation intendedto be covered in this bill, that is, dilution through the noncompetinguse of a trademark.[S13MY8-2045]{S5869}DeCONCINIMr. <T4>DeCONCINI. </T4>That is correct. This provision is specifically intendedto address a narrow category of famous registered trademarks where theunauthorized use by others, on dissimilar products for which the trademarkis not registered, dilutes the distinctiveness of the famous work.[S13MY8-2046]{S5869}RUDMANMr. RUDMAN. I thank the Senator for clarifying this matter.[S13MY8-2047]{S5869}GRASSLEYMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on behalf of the TrademarkReform Act, S. 1883. This important piece of legislation will amend theLanham Act, the law that has governed the trademark area for more than40 years. The bill improves, in a number of ways, trademark law for large and smallbusinesses, as well as consumers. First, it will make a major change inthe way we establish trademark use. Under current law, someone who wantsto use a particular trademark must put the mark ``in commerce'' so as todemonstrate the mark is truly in use. This is an outdated method, for oureconomy, which is in such an advanced technological state. Instead, thisbill would allow registration of a trademark based upon a bona fide intentto use. Thus, a company or an individual can reserve a trademark beforethe final product is ready to go to market. It will allow more certaintyin this field. Second, the bill creates a Federal remedy to protect famous trademarksagainst dilution of the mark. At the present time, such claims are resolvedunder 23 different State laws and the decisions of the State courts. Insteadof being subject to inconsistent decisions, truly famous marks will beentitled to national protection. And third, section 43 of the Lanham Act, which is essentially used to protectagainst unfair competition, will be modified. The changes, however, willonly codify the law laid down by our Federal courts. The modified section43 will entitle a suit to be brought for ``use of a false designation oforigin or of a false or misleading description or representation, misrepresentsthe nature, characteristics, or qualities of his or another person's goods,services, commercial activities or their geographic origin.'' Under thislanguage, the public will be protected against false advertising and unfaircompetition.This bill is a good example of how Congress can, in fact, improve a statute.Senator <T4>DeConcini,</T4> chairman of the Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrightsand Trademarks of the Judiciary Committee, is to be commended for his hardwork and thorough analysis of the trademark law and modification. The billwas introduced last fall, hearings were held this Spring, and a consensus,including industry groups and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, developedaround the importance of passing this bill. I thank Senator <T4>DeConcini</T4> for the opportunity to have a part in the passage ofthis important legislation. I urge my colleagues to approve it speedily.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.[S13MY8-2082]{S5874}CHAFEEMr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate has approved S.1986, as amended, a bill reported by the Committee on Environment and PublicWorks. This legislation will require that plastic six-pack yokes be madefrom degradable materials, a requirement which 11 States have already adopted.I would like to note, Mr. President, that this bill, as amended, has beenfully cleared with the chairman of the Committee on Environment and PublicWorks, Senator <T4>Burdick, </T4>and the ranking member of this committee, Senator <T4>Stafford</T4>. Also, the Society of the Plastics Industry, the major group representingthe industry, has reviewed this legislation and has indicated that it hasno objections to its passage.Last December the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported thePlastic Pollution Control Act of 1987, Senate bill 1986. The purpose ofthis bill was to implement the provisions of an international conventionfor the prevention of pollution from ships, commonly known as Marpol annexV, and to study, control, and reduce the pollution of aquatic environmentsfrom plastic materials.I was very pleased when the majority of provisions in S. 1986, includingprovisions relating to Marpol annex V, elements of a New York Bight restorationplan authored by Senator <T4>Lautenberg, </T4>and a major study of plastic recyclability and degradability,were included in a bill sent to the Senate from the House of Representatives.This bill, H.R. 3674, was passed by the Senate and signed into law by thePresident, becoming Public Law 100-220.Over the past decade there has been a growing concern among conservationistsand scientists over discarded plastic in our Nation's waters and on land.Entrapment in plastic debris such as six-pack holders, packing bands, lostor discarded fishing nets, and ingestion of plastic materials is knownto kill thousands of birds, sea lions, turtles, seals, and fish each year.The plastic pollution problem has grown to such a point that we cannotwalk to our Nation's beaches and parks without encountering plastic litter.Beach cleanup efforts in some States, including Rhode Island, have resultedin the collection of many thousands of discarded plastic products.Public Law 100-220 takes a giant step toward eliminating plastic wastein the environment: Marpol annex V will make it illegal for ships operatingin United States waters to discard plastic overboard, and the EnvironmentalProtection Agency will take a serious look at ways to reduce plastic pollutionin the environment. In particular, EPA will consider recycling and degradabilityas methods for reducing plastic in the solid waste stream and reducingplastic litter, especially in the marine environment. However, Mr. President, one provision in S. 1986 as reported by the EnvironmentCommittee was not included in the House bill due to jurisdictional concernsbetween committees in the House of Representatives. This provision relatesto a requirement that plastic six-pack holders be made from degradablematerials. This legislation will require the Administrator of EPA to require thatsixpack holders be made from naturally degradable materials. The Administratorwould be given 24 months to issue a regulation, and would allow a reasonabletime for affected parties to come into compliance, including the use ofexisting inventories. Mr. President, as I stated earlier, 11 States, including my own State ofRhode Island, have banned the sale of non degradable  six-pack holders.Other States include Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New York,New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, California, and Alaska. Degradable six-packholders are actually made from photo-degradable materials which, when exposedto sunlight, become brittle and break down into microscopic pieces. Industryhas indicated that it can meet the demand nationwide for degradable six-packholders. Since the technology exists, and is already in use in severalStates, it is no longer necessary to see six-pack holders littering ourbeaches and parks and entangling birds and sea lions. I am under no illusion that approving this legislation will solve the problemof plastic debris in the environment. Six-pack holders constitute onlya small portion of the total amount of plastic in the solid-waste stream.However, passage of this bill will send a strong and important message:That degradability is a viable option, and is one part of the solutionto the plastic waste problem.  I thank my colleagues for supporting this much-needed and overdue legislation.The remainder of my statement will further clarify the intent of this legislation.The legislation will require EPA to issue a regulation requiring that anyplastic ring carrier device which is made, used, or designed for the purposeof packaging, transporting, <ITAG tagnum="80">or carrying multipackaged cans or bottles, and which is of a size,shape, design or type capable, when discarded, of becoming entangled withfish or wildlife be made of naturally degradable material which, when discarded,decomposed within a period established by such regulation. Only plasticring carriers should be covered by this legislation. Not included for regulationare plastic devices which do not contain an enclosed hole or circle ofmore than 1\3/4\ inches in diameter or which do not contain a hole.</ITAG>For the purposes of this legislation ``naturally degradable material''means a material which when discarded will be reduced to environmentallybenign subunits under the action of normal environmental forces, such as,among others, biological decomposition, photo-degradation, and hydrolysis.The EPA shall issue this regulation no later than 24 months after the dateof the enactment of this act, unless EPA determines that it is not feasible,or that by requiring this regulation significant harm may result to humanhealth and/or the environment, including harm to fish and wildlife.Regulated items should decompose in the shortest period of time consistentwith the intended use of the item and the physical integrity required forsuch use. The regulation should allow a reasonable time for affected partiesto comply with the regulation and will allow sufficient time for affectedparties to use existing inventories.[S13MY8-2083]{S5875}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S13MY8-2084]{S5875}ESTABLISHM<ITAG tagnum="81">ESTABLISHMENT OF FBI DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINSITRATION SENIOR EXECUTIVESERVICE</ITAG>[S13MY8-2085]{S5875}BYRDMr. BYRD.
