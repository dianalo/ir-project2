<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-0879 </DOCNO><TEXT>Recent molecular dynamic simulations have shown that a 2D triangular Johnson(empirical iron potential) solid is brittle, compared with the behaviorof a Lennard-Jones (L-J) solid. The crack velocity reaches a limitingvelocity when the crack has grown by about 50 percent. The normalized(with respect to the longitudinal sound velocity) crack velocity vs thenormalized (with respect to the initial length) crack length was foundto be independent of the original crack length and the method of loading,indicating the absence of size effects. At high constant applied load,and hence high deformation, dislocation generation is observed with thecrack completely stopped for a significant period of time.</TEXT></DOC>
