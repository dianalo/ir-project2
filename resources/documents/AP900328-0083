Common Cause, which wants Congress to outlaw the so-called``member PACs,'' said five members of Congress had PACs whichraised more than $1 million in the past two years.   The analysis, based on year-end financial reports filed with theFederal Election Committee, covered 32 PACs associated with currentmembers of Congress that raised at least $25,000 from Jan. 1, 1987through Dec. 31, 1989.   Those 32 PACs raised $14.96 million in the three-year period,Common Cause said. The total raised by the member PACs in thatperiod surpasses $15 million if 15 additional member PACs whichraised less than $25,000 each in the period are also counted.   Common Cause, the self-styled public interest group, has beenheavily lobbying Congress to make several major changes to campaignfinance laws. The group has long been critical of allowing membersof Congress to establish PACs, saying such committeess allowspecial interests to curry favor with lawmakers by donating totheir campaigns and the member-controlled PACs.   Members of Congress can put the money to a variety of usesprovided they are related to the member's political activities.That provision has been loosely interpreted to allow member PACs tomake contributions to other candidates and to pay for politicaltravels and expenses.   Common Cause said five members have PACs that raised more than$1 million each during the three-year period. The lamwakers andamounts raised by their PACs in the last three years are: SenateRepublican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, $5 million; Sen. AlanCranston, D-Calif., $1.5 million; Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., $1.4million; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., $1.1 million; and Rep.Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., $1 million.   The top three Democratic House leaders also have member PACs.Speaker Thomas Foley's House Leadership Fund raised $353,509 in thethree-year period, according to its report to the FEC. MajorityLeader Richard Gephardt's PAC raised $495,000 in the period andMajority Whip William Gray's PAC raised $346,000.   The PAC controlled by House Republican Leader Robert Michel ofIllinois raised $72,000 in the same period and distributed morethan half of its receipts to GOP candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
