Now, with the company headed toward recovery, some think its stock is among the best buys on the Street.    One camp of investors is betting that the computer company will be snapped up in a takeover, that its assets are worth a lot more than the current share price indicates. Another camp sees a healthy operating comeback and growing profit down the road. Either way, analysts and some portfolio managers say it seems hard to go wrong.    Woolcott andamp; Co. analyst Gerard Hallaren calls Control Data &quot;severely undervalued&quot; while Mark Thompson of Wilke Capital Management, Minneapolis, says, &quot;I just can't believe somebody hasn't picked them up&quot; in a takeover.    Indeed, Control Data's common stock jumped $5 to 34 1/2 earlier this month on rumors that someone either was about to pounce on the company, or that management was engineering a leveraged buyout. While such rumors seem baseless, the stock is holding onto most of those gains, closing unchanged at 33 yesterday.    That doesn't surprise Mr. Thompson, who's among many asset hunters who regard Control Data as a breakup bargain. Breakup estimates run $40 to $60 a share. Mr. Thompson calculates that the government computer systems, technical support and the Ticketron and Arbitron data services have about $1 billion in assets alone. So a buyer at today's stock price could get the rest of the company &quot;debt-free for a couple of dollars,&quot; Mr. Thompson says.    Other nuggets include the company's 18.3% holding in Commercial Credit, its over-funded pension plan and its $500 million or so in tax-loss carry-forwards.    Moreover, Control Data has few defenses against a takeover. As a Delaware-based corporation, it can't seek shelter behind Minnesota's new anti-takeover law, and debt limitations prevent the company from buying back its stock. Management also is restricted on asset sales, and analysts think redeeming the company's 12 3/4% convertible debentures could be costly. &quot;They're like a lame duck,&quot; Mr. Thompson says.    But others see a different sort of bird. First Boston's Steven Milunovich, who thinks Control Data will remain independent, anticipates &quot;the ugly duckling transforming, if not into a swan, into a self-respecting mallard.&quot; Mr. Milunovich marked down his 1987 earnings estimate, to 60 cents from $1, when the company reported a surprising loss for the second quarter. And he says &quot;lack of revenue growth remains a concern.&quot;    Still, he cites improving margins in the Data Storage Products Group, which makes disk drives, and he's sanguine about ETA Systems, the company's fledgling supercomputer maker, which he figures could add 40 cents to earnings if it breaks even. The company only recently began producing revenue.    Brian Fernandez, who follows Control Data for Brean Murray, Foster, notes that second-quarter operating earnings actually rose, and that the bottom-line hits came from nonrecurring adjustments. For now, Mr. Fernandez is straddling the two investment strategies. Calling Control Data &quot;a very unusual collection of values,&quot; he also likes its &quot;prospects for an important earnings improvement beginning in the third quarter.&quot;    A big question at Control Data is Data Storage's future. The group was making a smart turnaround until it reported recurring problems with its FSD-II nine-inch disk drive. Thousands of the units experienced &quot;head crashes,&quot; in which platters of data spinning at 260 miles an hour suddenly bump together, often destroying data. Control Data says it has fixed the problem, but uncertainty over the cost of replacing the large drives has hurt its shaky credibility on the Street, masked progress Data Storage was making with smaller drives and rekindled speculation about the group's future.    Disk drives are increasingly becoming a commodity business, with shrinking margins and cutthroat competition. Consolidation is widely expected to continue, especially among 5 1/4-inch makers, leading some to suggest that Control Data may seek a joint venture with either another U.S. manufacturer or a Japanese one.    The company isn't commenting, although it's known to have been exploring such possibilities.    No matter what happens, &quot;We think it's a good investment,&quot; says David Pearl of BEA Associates, a New York-based pension fund manager holding nearly 1.3 million Control Data shares. Mr. Pearl votes with those who think it will remain independent. &quot;A company selling below book costs can be looked at as an acquisition,&quot; he says, &quot;but I think it's worth more as an operating entity.&quot;    ---   Control Data Corp.
