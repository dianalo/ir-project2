<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-1149 </DOCNO><TEXT>The heating of tissues by passing radio-frequency (rf) currents betweenelectrodes is a versatile method for inducing hyperthermia. Superficialtumors can be effectively heated by placing one electrode over the lesionand a larger one on the opposite side of the patient. Deep-seated voluminouslesions can be heated with large electrodes placed at opposing sidesof the patient. To obtain good energy deposition at depth, the electrodesshould not be smaller than the thickness of the patient. Theoretically,i.e. in a &quot;patient&quot; having uniform electrical properties, one could obtainhomogeneous heating at any depth. Problems with burns at the edges ofthe electrodes can be minimized, e.g. by placing a bag filled with salinesolution between the metal part of each electrode and the patient surface.Subcutaneous fat layers of about 1 cm thickness can be protected fromoverheating by cooling the electrodes to 5{sup 0}C. Thicker fat layers,however, many render this heating method ineffective. Despite the factthat the external electrode technique is very simple and that heatingpatterns obtained with it often compare favorably with those producedby much more complicated methods, it is rather seldom used. One reasonfor that may be that at frequencies above 1 MHz rf currents favor a pathclose to the patient surface, resulting in poor heating at depth. Methodsfor overcoming this problem for frequencies up to 27.12 MHz are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
