The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service recently postedteams of agents in Mexico to monitor the routes of Central Americanspassing through the country on their way to the United States,mostly to southern Texas.   The operation, which began Feb. 21 and has been canceled, cameunder criticism in Mexico. Mexican newspapers called it ``outrageousintrusion on Mexican sovereignty.''   The INS was quoted as saying its patrols were carried out withthe cooperation of the Mexican government.   The Foreign Relations Department, in a dispatch sent to newsagencies Wednesday afternoon, said, ``There is no diplomatic accordbetween Mexico and the United States that establishes thecollaboration of the Mexican police and the INS to avoid the flow ofundocumented immigrants to the United States.''   The INS agents, traveling through Mexico, filed their dailyreports to Washington from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, newsreports said.   The INS has denied that the operation was undercover, butcanceled it anyway.   Central Americans have been emigrating to the United States inever-increasing numbers, U.S. officials say. Some officials estimatethat 100,000 Central Americans will try to enter the United Statesthis year.   On Feb. 21, the U.S. government clamped down on the flow ofaliens asking for asylum in the United States by demanding proof ofpersecution. Since then, the overwhelming number of asylum cases insouth Texas have been denied and the number of people seekingamnesty has dropped.</TEXT></DOC>
