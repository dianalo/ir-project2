Bush said he had contacted many world leaders including BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and ``We have had assurance afterassurance... they want to help.''   ``You can just rest assured that we're going about our businessin, I'd say, a prudent way,'' he said, declining to discuss anyspecifics of what he had in mind.   Asked at a photo session if he had information that hostages'lives might be in danger in the wake of the reported execution ofMarine Lt. Col. William Higgins by Shiite Moslem captors, Bushreplied:   ``We are considering that that might well be the case, givenstatements we have seen.''   ``Please assume we are thinking prudently about this matter inevery way possible,'' and using diplomatic channels, the presidentsaid. ``We're leaving no stone unturned.''   However, he added, ``We're dealing with less than a full deckwhen it comes to information. It is very hard when you're dealingwith this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to getall the information that you need to make a decision ... We are notdealing with all the facts.''   Bush was asked if it would make matters easier if Israelreleased the leading Moslem cleric whose kidnapping inflamed thehostage situation and prompted threats against the eight Americansheld captive.   Without directly criticizing Israel, the president repeated hisearlier call for a release of all hostages held by all parties inthe region.   ``I think the release of everyone held against their will wouldbe a good thing,'' he said.   Bush made the comments during a picture-taking session withSheik Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, the foreign minister of thePersian Gulf state of Bahrain. The minister condemned the reportedkilling of Higgins as an act against all humanity.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said theadministration is pleased with a statement Tuesday by Iran'sPresident-elect Ali Akbar Rafsanjani condemning Higgins' apparentexecution and all acts of a terrorist nature.   She called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance with thespirit'' of his statement. ``We remain convinced that Iran is in aposition to bring significant influence to bear on those who holdthe hostages and call on it to do so,'' she said.   Ms. Tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide toPalestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizingthe execution of Higgins.   Asked about potential military action in light of the movementof U.S. warships in the Middle East, Bush replied, ``We'reprudently planning.''   However, his comments seemed to indicate he has made nodecisions on a plan of action.   He said he was weighing the situation with ``a heavy heart'' andthat ``it transcends religion, it transcends alliances, it gets in... to a matter that concerns that entire civilized world. So wewill keep on trying.''   The president is getting help from the pope and seeking aid fromother world leaders to try to solve the Lebanon hostage crisis, butthe White House cautioned against hopes for a quick solution.   Bush received his daily intelligence briefing this morning inadvance of a meeting with his top national security aides to assessinformation coming from the Middle East.   Meanwhile, the Vatican announced today that Pope John Paul IIhas agreed to intervene to seek the return to the United States ofthe body of Lt. Col. Higgins, whose reported hanging Monday by hiskidnappers in Lebanon precipitated the crisis.   In a 12-minute telephone call Tuesday, Bush asked the pope tointercede in getting the return of Higgins' body if, in fact, theofficer had been executed. ``His holiness expressed the willingnessof the Holy See to find a solution to this problem,'' a Vaticanstatement said.   Pentagon officials said today the USS Belknap, the flagship ofthe U.S. 6th Fleet, and the fleet's commander canceled a scheduledvisit to the Soviet port of Sevastapol to be ``at the beck andcall'' of Bush in case he needs them. The aircraft carrier USSAmerica also has cut short a visit and left the port of Singapore,officials said.   But officials played down the possibility of a military strikeagainst hostage-holders. ``These are not necessarily bellicosemoves _ but we want to be ready in case we are needed. ...These areprudent measures,'' said one official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``The risks appear to greatly outweigh the potential payoff'' ofany military strike, an official said Tuesday.   And the White House went out of its way to avoid drama thatwould make it appear a crisis was engulfing Bush's presidency.   On Tuesday night the president went ahead with plans for ajovial barbecue for Congress members on the White House lawn.Appearing in shirtsleeves and leather-pocketed casual pants, thepresident dined on ribs, chatted cheerfully with his picnic-tablecompanions and clapped to the lively tunes of the Oak Ridge Boys.   ``These are not easy days, either in the Congress or in theWhite House,'' Bush said in brief remarks. ``There are overwhelmingevents that concern everybody here. But even though there arecomplicated times, I think an evening like this with just plainrelaxation with friends is very, very significant and veryimportant.''   Spokesman Fitzwater indicated a dramatic response was notimminent. Rather, he said reporters should view the situation as``a process for dealing with the situation over the long term andnot look for any quick decision points.''   ``We don't want to create a crisis atmosphere,'' he said.   Administration officials said they still had no firmconfirmation that Higgins was dead, as his Shiite terrorist captorsclaimed Monday.   Higgins' wife, Robin, said through a spokeswoman in Washingtonshe could not tell whether her husband was the man shown hanging ina grisly videotape the kidnappers released.   Besides telephoning the pope, Bush called Turkish Prime MinisterTurgut Ozal, while other U.S. officials contacted the Soviet Unionand other countries in the Middle East seeking assistance inwinning freedom for the remaining hostages.   The United States also is going through intermediaries to seekhelp from Iran, which is believed to have influence with kidnapperswho hold the hostages. The United States does not have formaldiplomatic relations with Iran.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tehran thatMoscow would use its growing influence in Iran on behalf of thehostages.</TEXT></DOC>
