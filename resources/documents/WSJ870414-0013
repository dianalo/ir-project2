Proposes ContractTo Striking News Writers</HL><DD> 04/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CBS CCB LABORTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   CBS Inc. said it presented to news employees a proposed contract that the network hopes will settle a six-week old strike by members of the Writers Guild.    Terms of the package, which would cover about 300 writers, editors and other CBS News employees, weren't disclosed. But in a statement, CBS said the proposal &quot;reflects the needs and interests of the company.&quot; The proposal came after several days of hard negotiations between the two sides, sources close to the talks said.    A spokesman for the Writers Guild of America said the union's negotiating team would review the package. The union has complained that, among other things, CBS is seeking to eliminate arbitration recourse for dismissed union members.    The union also is negotiating a separate new contract for about 225 members at Capital Cities/ABC Inc. Both groups of employees went on strike in early March after negotiators failed to reach agreement with the networks on new contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
