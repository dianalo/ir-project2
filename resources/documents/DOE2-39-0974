Because the {beta}-phaseis the low temperature phase, these fiber crystals were grown from solutionto avoid the {alpha}-{beta} solid-state phase transformation encounteredwhen crystals are grown directly from the melt. In this study Na/sub2/O and B/sub 2/O/sub 3/ were found to be the most useful solvents. Theeffects of solution composition and seed orientation on fiber growthrate and quality were investigated. Inclusions were observed in somefibers and the relationship between the formation of inclusions and supercoolingat the growth interface is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
