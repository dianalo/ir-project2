In one of a series of reports on important issues for thetransition to the new presidency, the General Accounting Office saidit has found many instances when a follow-up was needed to get thebenefits of an international trade agreement.   It added that delaying tactics and slow dispute settlements haveoften frustrated efforts to get satisfaction, but the new Trade Actstrengthens the U.S. hand.   ``Failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger aunilateral U.S. response,'' the GAO report said. ``The newadministration should show strong resolve to vigorously use thesenew powers.''   One provision of the trade law Reagan signed in August permitshim to specify what he considers high-priority unfair tradepractices and to start action toward retaliation while trying to geta settlement by negotiation.   Another provision permits him to rule that a country denyinginternationally recognized rights to labor can be considered asengaging in an unfair trade practice, and to retaliate against itstrade.   The GAO complained of defects in efforts to promote exports. Itsaid the Commerce Department has chosen questionable trade promotionevents and has been active in countries with little or no potentialfor buying more U.S. goods. It did not specify the nations.   It characterized as ``largely symbolic'' the controls put onexports to further foreign policy objectives, as distinct fromcontrols that have security objectives.   ``When these controls are symbolic, they do not prevent thetargeted country from getting the controlled products from othercountries,'' the report said.   ``Instead their costs are borne by American businesses in theform of export sales lost to firms in other countries.''   The report did not specify either the countries targeted by theU.S. controls or their suppliers. One nation to which exports arecontrolled for foreign policy reasons is South Africa, whereJapanese and West European suppliers have replaced many exports thatcan now no longer be shipped by Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
