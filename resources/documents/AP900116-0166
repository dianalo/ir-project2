(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat James J. Florio became NewJersey's 49th governor Tuesday, promising to use new ideas ``topreserve the old ideals.''   Florio, an eight-term congressman from southern New Jersey,succeeds Republican Thomas H. Kean, who could not seek a thirdconsecutive term. Kean will become president of the private DrewUniversity in Madison.   ``After 15 years in Washington, I return to New Jersey,'' Floriotold more than 1,800 people crowded inside the War Memorial hallnear the Statehouse. ``As I look out on this vast audience, let mesimply say, it's good to be home.''   Florio, 52, succeeded the enormously popular Kean on a day ofprayers, parades and platitudes, but also inherited deep problemsthat stand to make his first year in office a trying one.   Backing up a campaign pledge to attack soaring auto insurancerates, Florio called for a special joint session of the Legislatureon Monday to unveil his long-awaited strategy. New Jersey carinsurance premiums average about $1,000 per car and rank among thehighest in the nation.   Florio won the Statehouse on his third try last November bytrouncing GOP nominee and fellow U.S. Rep. James Courter.   ``My goal is a simple one. When I leave here, I want to beremembered as the governor who brought new ideas to preserve oldideals,'' said Florio.   After his address to the War Memorial throng, Florio led thefirst inaugural parade in New Jersey in more than 50 years. A$500-a-plate Inaugural Ball capped the list of festivities oninauguration day.</TEXT></DOC>
