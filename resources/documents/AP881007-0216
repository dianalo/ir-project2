Tandy Corp. will make personal computers to Digital'sspecifications, which Digital will market and sell under its brand,Geoffrey Burr, a Digital group manager for strategic relations,said Thursday.   ``The personal computer market has moved more and more into acommodity orientation. Digital doesn't feel that we (should be)using our resources to try and compete in manufacturing that kindof product,'' Burr said. ``So we cut out and made an agreement witha company which is.''   The agreement comes two days after Digital announced its firstlicensing agreement ever to allow an outside firm to manufactureits computers. On Tuesday, Digital and Allen-Bradley Co. ofCleveland announced an alliance designed to strengthen Digital'shold in the manufacturing automation market.   ``It's desirable for DEC to be able to provide the completecomputing needs to any major customer from the personal level tothe super-minicomputer level,'' said Bruce Watts, an analyst andmanaging director of Needham andamp; Co.   ``Most analysts would agree that DEC is making the rightdecision in augmenting their product line through outsidesuppliers,'' Watts said.   Watts said Digital missed the boat with its first attempt at apersonal computer line five or six years ago.   ``DEC had a major false start in personal computers when theyintroduced a number of products, including a product called Rainbow(and) ... they didn't meet with a great deal of success,'' Wattssaid. ``For one reason or another the personal computer was nottheir focus at that time.''   Burr said the arrangement with Tandy was in response to customerdemand.   ``Digital has been asked to provide support for a range ofdifferent vendors and we have concluded agreements with several ofthose companies to provide full service and support,'' he said.   Digital agreed to service and certify certain Tandy personalcomputers to operate in Digital networks. Company officials refusedto describe the computers in detail.   Dean Burran, the marketing manager for Digital's personalcomputer group, said the new machines would differ from Tandy's ownline in extra features that will make them fit easily intoDigital's networking system.   Tandy spokesman Mark Yamagata said he was not able to reveal aproduct line. ``We're their manufacturing source. We will work todevelop the computers to their specifications,'' he said.   Sonny Monosson, an independent analyst who has followed Digitalfor 20 years, said Digital has created systems in the past tointerface with software from other companies. But he said this wasDigital's first marketing agreement with another company.   ``I wonder how Apple, Compaq, Olivetti are going to feel aboutthis new arrangement,'' Monosson said. ``This is the first productthat they are offering to distribute through their salesoperation.''</TEXT></DOC>
