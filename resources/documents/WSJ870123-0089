The plan comes at a time when major competitors are touting the technology in their long-distance networks. However, at a news conference yesterday, ATandamp;T executives said the upgrade is in response to demand and isn't the result of increased competition or lobbying efforts by its former Bell units to enter the long-distance business.    As previously reported, the company last year spent $2 billion on its network. That accounted for 57% of ATandamp;T's capital spending budget of $3.5 billion in 1986. The company's capital spending budget for this year is $3.9 billion.    Frank Blount, president of ATandamp;T's Network Operations Group, said modernization and expansion of the network is being spurred by &quot;customer demand.&quot; He said demand for transmission capacity is growing by about 10% annually at ATandamp;T, up three or four percentage points from only a few years ago.    Much of this growth is the result of an increase in communications between computers -- a capability that has been a major selling point for computer makers for the last two years. ATandamp;T and its current major competitors, US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp., are emphasizing telecommunications technology such as fiber optics that generally provides clearer and easier transmission of computer information.    Telephone companies have been waging an acrimonious &quot;fiber war,&quot; with each company claiming it has more fiber-optic transmission routes in place at a particular time than another. Sprint, which says it will have 23,000 route miles of fiber in place by the end of 1989, plans a major new advertising campaign during this Sunday's Super Bowl highlighting the ease and clarity of its fiber optic transmission.    MCI said it plans to have more than 10,000 route miles of fiber in place by the end of this year, up from 5,500 at the end of 1986. ATandamp;T's Mr. Blount said his company will have 24,000 fiber route miles in place by the end of 1989, up from 11,000 currently.    While fiber-optics technology does provide clearer transmissions, Mr. Blount stressed that a company's total mix of technologies, as well as the intelligence in its phone switches, contributes a great deal to how efficient a carrier operates -- as well as the services it can sell. The sophistication of the electronics put on the ends of fiber cable also determines how much information that cable actually can transmit.    &quot;This preoccupation with what kind of technology is in the network is misleading,&quot; Mr. Blount said. &quot;You have to look at the entire fabric of the network.&quot; ATandamp;T plans to expand digital capacity to 53,000 route miles by the end of 1989 up from 32,000 digital route miles currently, using both microwave and fiber-optic technologies. Digital facilities send computer traffic more easily than older analog facilities, which are more suitable for voice transmission.    ATandamp;T previously said it would spend between $2 billion and $3 billion on its network this year; US Sprint said it plans to spend $800 million this year. Mr. Blount yesterday said ATandamp;T expects about one-third of its 1.4 billion circuit miles to be digital by the end of this year, using either fiber or microwave radio. ATandamp;T currently has 1.216 billion circuit miles in place domestically, of which about 10% are digital. In contrast to route miles, the number of circuit miles indicates capacity, with one circuit mile equaling one standard voice conversation sent one mile.    Mr. Blount said about $1.5 billion of the total spent this year will be used to upgrade older analog facilities to digital, with most of the remaining spent to expand the network and build loops between fiber-optic lines. Such loops are important, he said, to prevent loss of service when fiber lines -- which can transmit huge amounts of information -- are accidentally cut. ATandamp;T currently is attaching electronics at the ends of such cable that allow each pair of hair-thin glass fibers to transmit 24,000 separate conversations at once.    Mr. Blount said ATandamp;T will also replace more than 300 analog switches this year with 103 bigger, digital switches. </TEXT></DOC>
