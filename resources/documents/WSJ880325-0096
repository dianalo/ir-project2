Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Giving the strongest hint yet that the Securities and Exchange Commission expects Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to fight any case against it in court, SEC Chairman David Ruder said litigating certain &quot;large cases&quot; could in the future absorb as much as 20% of his enforcement staff's time.    &quot;We think there's some possibility that we will be in what I call 'large-case litigation,' which will require very substantial resources,&quot; Mr. Ruder told a House Appropriations subcommittee yesterday in testifying about the SEC's budget request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. &quot;We may be devoting as much as 20% of our enforcement staff's work to these large cases, if they should come.&quot; Such an expenditure of time suggests that the SEC doesn't expect settlements from major players in the crop of cases stemming from the Wall Street insider-trading scandals.    Mr. Ruder told the subcommittee he couldn't provide details. In subsequent remarks to the financial press, he declined to comment on whether he was referring to the Drexel case.    Asked to elaborate on his testimony, he said that defense lawyers are becoming &quot;more combative&quot; in contesting SEC actions. He cited the Blinder, Robinson andamp; Co. case, in which the SEC earlier this year received a setback from a federal appeals court. The court expressed misgivings that the agency deals more harshly with newer brokerage houses than it does with old-line Wall Street firms, and it sent the administrative case back to the SEC for further hearing.    As previously reported, the SEC in January notified Drexel and several officials of the New York-based securities firm that the agency's enforcement staff was likely to recommend a civil action against them. Other transactions involving Drexel remain under investigation by the SEC and by a federal grand jury.    In other testimony about the SEC's 1989 budget request of $160.9 million, Mr. Ruder warned that the agency's responsibilities have grown to the point where &quot;there is a wide imbalance between those responsibilities and the resources to carry them out.&quot; In addition, he said, the SEC's internal operations haven't kept pace with automation in the securities industry.    In his comments to the press, Mr. Ruder also took vigorous exception to congressional testimony delivered Wednesday by Robert Glauber, the director of the presidential task force on the October stock market crash. Mr. Glauber said the SEC shouldn't be made the overarching regulator of the financial markets, because it doesn't have the expertise to take on the job.    On Wednesday the SEC had declined to comment on Mr. Glauber's remarks. But after his testimony, Mr. Ruder brought up the matter, saying, &quot;I couldn't disagree more strongly with that statement.&quot; He said the SEC's staff has developed &quot;a large degree of sophistication&quot; on the intermarket issues the task force identified as critical. </TEXT></DOC>
