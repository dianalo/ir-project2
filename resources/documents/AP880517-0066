(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL said it has issued a final plea forsupporters to save the ministry from liquidation under a bankruptcyplan its fallen founder Jim Bakker called a ``literal giveaway.''   PTL, in a revised reorganization plan filed Monday, outlinedplans to sell Heritage USA in Fort Mill and then lease the propertyrequired to carry on its church and network television ministries.   ``Because of past scandals and credibility problems, PTL andother television ministries are facing extinction,'' said thedocument signed by PTL trustee David Clark.   Although the plan filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbiaprovides for the sale of all PTL assets to pay creditors, it leavesan opening for PTL supporters to ``save the ministry'' byincreasing contributions to forestall a complete liquidation.   ``If the ministry does not receive such support, it is possiblethat it will be lost forever,'' the plan said.   Bakker, who founded PTL in 1974, developed the Christian retreatand cable television network and then lost it in March 1987 after asex scandal, reacted with disdain to the developments.   ``I am deeply saddened that PTL trustee, former CBN executiveDavid Clark, would attempt a literal giveaway of PTL and HeritageUSA to a secular organization,'' Bakker said Monday in a recordedmessage on the answering machine at his Palm Springs, Calif., home.   Several potential buyers have expressed interest in the retreat.One is George Shinn, a sports entrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C.,who wants to build a minor league baseball stadium and a trainingcenter for his fledgling National Basketball Association team.   PTL, located about 10 miles south of Charlotte, has an estimated$130 million in assets, some of which is contested. PTL has beenunder protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code for11 months.   On April 21, the Internal Revenue Service revoked its tax-exemptstatus because of an audit that concluded Bakker and his aidesprofited excessively from donations to the ministry and becausemuch of PTL's operations are commercial rather than ministerial.   Also last month, Clark told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynoldsthat PTL would not be able to pay the $5.7 million initialinstallment on its debt by May 2 as required in the originalbankruptcy plan filed in December.   Reynolds then ordered PTL to come up with a liquidation plan topay creditors.   In the revised plan, PTL blamed unspecified scandals andunforeseen attacks on television ministries for the inability toraise enough money to pay its debts.   ``Due to various scandals and concerns over the use ofcontributions, donations dropped drastically,'' the document said.   Under the revised plan, Reynolds would appoint a board of threebusinessmen to preside over PTL as a self-liquidating trust, saidDavid West, PTL director of public relations.   The amended plan establishes a priority for the sale of $160million in assets in a 60-month period and will authorize leasingof ministry assets to a separate, non-profit corporation calledHeritage Ministries Inc., West said.   The priorities for sale, in order, are the 1,700 acres ofundeveloped property, the Heritage Grand Hotel and Tower, the waterpark, a campground, an apartment complex, a prayer center, aVictorian-style home, an amphitheater, the TV network and HeritageVillage Church.   ``We would only liquidate what is required to meet the debt,''West said.   Whatever money or property was left after debts were paid wouldgo back to Heritage Ministries, which would lease the church, theamphitheater, a prayer center and equipment required to run thetelevision network, West said.   The next major step for PTL will come June 16 when Reynoldshears objections to the amended plan.</TEXT></DOC>
