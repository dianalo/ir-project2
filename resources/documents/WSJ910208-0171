FDIC Chairman William Seidman told the House BudgetCommittee that the premium increase, to take effect June 30,would support borrowings of $10 billion to $15 billion, whichthe insurance fund would repay over about 15 years. Thecurrent premium is 19.5 cents for each $100 of domesticdeposits.</LP><TEXT>   Bankers are worried about the cost of any plan to rebuildthe Bank Insurance Fund. In response, Mr. Seidman told thecommittee that &quot;this plan is specifically designed not tocripple the banking industry's lending ability.&quot; After thehearing, he said the FDIC had calculated that a five-centpremium increase, to 24.5 cents for each $100, &quot;is what {thebanks} can reasonably do without impairing liquidity.&quot;   The premium rate was just 12 cents until Jan. 1, and manybankers worry that the sharp increase will crimp profits andworsen the credit crunch. &quot;It's quite an increase, and thereare some banks that can't afford it,&quot; a banking industryofficial said. &quot;They're going to have to cut back. They'llhave to reduce credit. They'll cut salaries. They'll dowhat's necessary.&quot;   Bankers, who have been negotiating with the FDIC forweeks, are still looking for ways to reduce the sting of theprogram to recapitalize the insurance fund. One plan they'reconsidering is keeping the premium at 19.5 cents for each$100 of deposits and raising the rest of the money on abroader base, such as an assessment against bank assets. Thiswould increase the cost for large banks that use foreigndeposits -- which aren't subject to the premium -- to supportlending.   Several other details remain to be worked out -- the sizeof the loan, its maturity, the interest rate and exactly howthe money would be used. A banking industry syndicateprobably would lend the money to the FDIC, possibly through abond offering. Other options would be to borrow the moneyfrom the Treasury or the Federal Reserve. In the latter case,the reserves the banks must keep at the Fed would serve ascollateral. Regardless of the financing method, premiumswould still have to rise to repay the loans.   At the hearing yesterday, Mr. Seidman expressed urgencyabout strengthening the fund, which has been drained by awave of bank failures. Concerns about deposit insurance arecreating nervousness about the banking system, he said.&quot;There's a loss of confidence out there that's veryworrisome,&quot; Mr. Seidman warned.   Over the past four years, around 800 bank failures havecost the FDIC's Bank Insurance Fund $23 billion, reducing thefund to $8.5 billion at the end of 1990. If the currentrecession is mild and ends by the middle of this year, theFDIC projects, the fund will fall to $3.9 billion by the endof this year and $2.4 billion at the end of 1992. A longerrecession could deplete the fund by the end of this year anddrive it $5.8 billion into the red by the end of 1992.   Banking industry leaders, who held their second &quot;summit&quot;meeting on the fund yesterday, are determined to find ways toreduce the drain on the fund. Many of them want thegovernment to change or scrap the so-called too-big-to-faildoctrine, under which the government decides to protect thelargest troubled or failed banks to avoid upsetting thefinancial system. Under this doctrine, the government decidesto protect troubled banks' uninsured depositors -- those withmore than $100,000.   Many bankers contend that when the government makes such adecision, the cost of paying uninsured depositors -- thosewith more than $100,000 on deposit -- should be paid by theTreasury or the Fed rather than by the banking industrythrough the insurance fund. This week, the American BankersAssociation criticized the Treasury's bank overhaul plan fornot proposing to abolish the too-big-to-fail idea.   In addition, the industry and Mr. Seidman want to use someof the new money to make capital investments in weak banks inorder to head off failures or to promote mergers. However,details of this plan remain to be worked out.</TEXT></DOC>
