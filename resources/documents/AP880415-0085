(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 8{-month-old Navajo girl, caught in atug-of-war of cultures and laws, has been handed over to tribalauthorities by the natural mother and the foster parents who caredfor the infant since birth.   The baby, named Allyssa Kristian, screamed ``Da Da'' Thursdayand reached out for the only family she's ever known as she wastaken away by an Indian social worker.   Patricia Keetso, the 21-year-old unmarried natural mother whowanted her baby to be adopted by Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose,Calif., also cried as she and the couple gave up custody of Allyssa.   Keetso, her mother and Mrs. Pitts accompanied the social worker,an Indian attorney and the baby on the flight to Arizona for atribal court hearing.   Pitts accused Navajo authorities of reneging on an agreement totake a later flight, when his family had reserved seats, and tryingto leave shortly after the exchange. ``You lied to us,'' he yelledat Patrick Guillery, the Navajo attorney.   Guillery said he made no promise about when the flight wouldleave, and told Pitts he would be violating a court order if hedidn't turn over the baby immediately.   After the group arrived in Phoenix, the social worker and Navajoofficials got into a van with the baby and left, leaving Keetso andMrs. Pitts behind. They had expected to fly with the baby toFlagstaff before driving to the reservation.   Navajo Tribal spokeswoman Karen Diakun said the infant was inthe tribe's custody and that the location would not be revealed.   ``The Division of Social Welfare will make the appropriateplacement until the court decides otherwise,'' Ms. Diakun said,adding that no date had been set for a hearing on the case at TubaCity Judicial District Children's Court.   The Pittses have said they will continue to seek to adopt thehild.   Ms. Keetso had met the Pitts couple through an adoption attorneywho advertised in a newspaper on the reservation.   The Pittses, both 33 and parents of an 8-year-old boy, broughtMs. Keetso into their home when she was seven months pregnant. Theygave her $200 a month for spending money, paid medical costs,coached her through labor and brought Allyssa home after her birthJuly 20, 1987.   Despite the wishes of the natural mother, a Santa Clara CountySuperior Court judge ruled earlier this week that Allyssa must beturned over to Navajo authorities, pending a tribal decision oncustody.   Violet A.P. Lui, an attorney for the Tribal Department ofJustice in Window Rock, Ariz., said a custody hearing would be heldsoon. She said she didn't know whether Keetso or the Pittses wouldbe able to visit the baby.   The Navajos, citing the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, filed acomplaint in the Santa Clara County court in February to gainjurisdiction of the case and stop the Pittses' adoption petition.   San Jose Superior Court Judge Leslie Nichols ruled that Keetsolegally resided on the reservation in Arizona and was under thejurisdiction of Navajo authorities.   Rather than appeal Nichols' ruling, the Pittses decidedWednesday to drop their adoption petition and pursue the casethrough the tribal court.</TEXT></DOC>
