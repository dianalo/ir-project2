Hundreds of suppliers in 42 states are affected. ThoughMcDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics declined to say howmuch money is involved, several Wall Street analystsestimated that they had been planning to pay out a total ofat least $600 million over the next several quarters.</LP><TEXT>   A General Dynamics spokesman confirmed that &quot;we aresuspending payments until we can ascertain where we standwith all our vendors,&quot; but he stressed that &quot;this istemporary, and we won't arbitrarily stop paying people whohave a right to be paid.&quot;   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, however, conceded thatit was difficult to determine how long the suspension couldlast, and he didn't rule out the possibility that the issuecould wind up in court.   &quot;The problem is that the government has stopped payingus,&quot; he said. &quot;And when we cease to get money, we cease topay it out, too.&quot;   Development of the A-12, designed as the Navy'snext-generation attack plane, was halted earlier this weekafter Defense Secretary Dick Cheney charged that McDonnellDouglas and General Dynamics were unable to meet the terms oftheir contract. The government is demanding $1.9 billion inreimbursements.   The contractors, meanwhile, are contesting the charge thatthey defaulted on the accord and are pursuing $1.6 billion inclaims for what they see as unanticipated design difficultiesand work changes ordered by the Navy. It is expected to takeyears for the dispute to be resolved.   As of yesterday, word of the suspension apparently hadn'treached many, if any, of the A-12 suppliers. Officials atGeneral Electric Co., maker of the A-12's engines; GeneralMotors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. division, which was tooutfit the plane with cockpit displays; and Litton IndustriesInc., which was building navigational gear and otherequipment for the aircraft, all said they hadn't received anynotice that payments will be interrupted. &quot;We expect to bepaid in full for what we are owed,&quot; a Litton spokesman said.   A spokesman for Westinghouse Electric Corp., responsiblefor the A-12's avionics system, said he had no immediateinformation on the situation. The complete list of A-12subcontractors remains classified.   Hit hardest could be small companies that don't have bigcash cushions. But Buddy Langford, a vice president atProgressive Inc., a provider of aluminum and titaniumstructures based in Arlington, Texas, said his 150-employeecompany would think twice before getting into too much of arow with one of the aerospace giants, especially GeneralDynamics.   Noting that Progressive is still a supplier to the GeneralDynamics F-16 fighter program, he said, &quot;It probably wouldn'tbe wise thing to get into a legal battle. It could more orless end our relationship.&quot; Mr. Langford figured Progressiveis still owed $200,000 to $300,000 for its work on the A-12.</TEXT></DOC>
