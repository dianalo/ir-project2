Ten other guerrillas fled, two bleeding of wounds they sufferedin the nightlong clash with Israeli troops and allied militiamen ofthe South Lebanon Army.   A Lebanese Army corporal driving on a nearby road in thefoothills of Mount Hermon also was wounded.   The military command in Israel confirmed the clash near thisvillage, about three miles north of Israel's so-called securityzone.   It identified the dead officer as 1st Lt. Yaron Yogev, 23. Itsaid he was shot after his unit spotted and attacked the``terrorist'' squad.   The battle with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades ragedunder parachute flares for eight hours before the Israelis and SLAmilitiamen pulled back to the security zone, police said.   The bodies of the four guerrillas lay on the ground near AinAtta for several hours after the Israeli-SLA force withdrew.   ``They may be booby-trapped. Explosive experts are needed toexamine the corpses before removing them,'' a police spokesmansaid. He cannot be identified under standing rules.   He said Israel and the SLA apparently were tipped about anattempt to infiltrate the security zone.   The police spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to SamirGhoshe's Palestine Popular Struggle Front.   The group claimed responsibility in a statement distributed inBeirut. It identified those killed as Mohammed Omar Sharif, Ahmedal-Amed, both Palestinians, and Samir Izzidin Shami and HamadahDafi, who were Lebanese.   The Front, backed and financed by Libya, is a hard-line factionwithin Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization. It hasseldom been involved in attacks against Israel or its borderenclave.   The wounded guerrillas are Palestinians. Police identified themas the squad commander and his assistant, but did not providenames.   They were seen heading back with eight surviving attackers tothe Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in eastern Lebanon after thebattle.   ``We belong to the Palestine Popular Struggle Front and Libya'sRevolutionary Committees,'' one guerrilla shouted to a small groupof reporters, flashing his fingers in a victory sign. ``I'll shootyou if you take pictures.''   Israel staked out the security zone in 1985, when it withdrewthe bulk of its invading army after a three-year occupation.   The zone covers 440 square miles, stretching from theMediterranean coast to the slopes of Mount Hermon. It is controlledby the 3,000-strong SLA, which is backed by 1,000 Israeli soldiers.   Radical Palestinians and pro-Syrian Lebanese leftist factions aswell as Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem fundamentalists are involvedin guerrilla warfare to force out the Israelis.   The Israelis have left the security zone several times in thepast few months in pursuit of guerrillas, and a senior Israeliofficial said Tuesday the army would continue that policy.   ``When we think there are going to be terrorist attacks onIsrael from outside the security zone, we feel that we have a freehand to act in order to prevent in advance attempts toinfiltrate,'' said Yossi Olmert, director of the Government PressOffice.   Olmert said there had been 17 infiltration attempts by land andsea this year in which 36 Arabs and two Israelis were killed.   ``None of them has reached Israel itself and this is exactly whyit is vitally important for us, even more than before, to emphasizethe significance of this security zone as an effective buffer,'' hetold reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
