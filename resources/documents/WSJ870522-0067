The cartel should strive, instead, to foster stability in world oil markets by keeping prices balanced with production, Saudi Arabia and its allies said. This commitment by a group of oil producers holding more reserves than the rest of the world combined implies moderate energy prices for the next few years.    The move came from the oil ministers of the regional alliance of six small Gulf states known as the Gulf Cooperation Council. They include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, all of which support Iraq in its nearly seven-year-old war with Iran.    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia added a sharp edge to the oil ministers' pronouncements. In a rare interview Tuesday with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Siyassah, the King said that prices ought to stay at current levels for the next two years. His comments reflect deepening differences, both political and economic, between Iran and most of the Arab world.    Following a meeting in Saudi Arabia this week, the ministers said oil prices should remain around $18 a barrel. They also insisted that OPEC production should slowly rise, according to the program it set last December, by nearly 2.5 million barrels a day to a ceiling of 18.3 million barrels a day by year-end.    This boost in output was designed to match an anticipated rise in demand for OPEC oil while keeping prices near $18 a barrel, the goal agreed upon last December by all 13 members of the cartel.    Gulf sources said the firm tone of the GCC countries was aimed at Iran, whose prime minister, Mir Hossein Mousavi, currently argues for different plans. Earlier this month, the Iranian official called on OPEC to keep production at the current 15.8 million barrels a day, force prices up and abandon the dollar as the unit of pricing because of the recent fall in its value.    Gulf sources said that Saudi Arabia fears that if adopted &quot;or even seriously discussed,&quot; in the words of an Arab senior official who asked to remain anonymous, these suggestions would &quot;bring back to oil markets the aura of upheaval&quot; that prevailed last year.    &quot;They have sealed the fate of the OPEC meeting,&quot; commented Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a trade newsletter here. He noted that the Saudi-engineered decision is tantamount to setting OPEC's agenda for the meeting. GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar produce together more than a third of the cartel's oil.    The Arab move reflects an irritation with Tehran that first surfaced last December, when Saudi Arabia and Iran worked closely together to forge the current OPEC accord.    Iran's tenacious prosecution of its war against Iraq and intensified attacks against Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf have since chilled its relations with Saudi Arabia. For their part, the Saudis want to avoid protracted talks at the semiannual OPEC gathering, limiting Iran's room to maneuver. These tough Saudi attitudes also coincide with King Fahd's efforts of late to close Arab ranks. He recently engineered meetings between quarreling Arab states, including Morocco and Algeria and Syria and Iraq.    Unlike past confrontations with Iran, this new round is heavily tilted in favor of Saudi Arabia. Promoting their view that oil prices should rise slowly and predictably, the Saudis have obtained commitments for both price and production restraint from many non-OPEC producers -- such as the Soviet Union, Egypt and Norway. In addition, many OPEC experts now believe that this is the only way to restore oil's substantial share of world energy markets lost to cheaper fuels since 1973.    One result of these Saudi efforts was Egypt's announcement yesterday that it will freeze its oil output for the next five years at about 870,000 barrels a day in support of OPEC policies to stabilize prices.    In the interview with the Kuwaiti paper, King Fahd expressed Saudi Arabia's concern about the burden of rising energy costs and the danger of instability to Third World economies. The king's words tended to confirm the notion that he firmly directs Saudi Arabia's oil policy himself, permitting his representatives little flexibility in OPEC meetings.    The king last year fired his previous oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, who had sought to bargain with the Iranians until they maneuvered him, and Saudi Arabia, into a corner. As a result of that cornering, Saudi Arabia was forced last August to agree to a policy profferred by the Iranians of cutting back OPEC output. Now Saudi Arabia is saying it won't go any further.    Arab state sources said that over the past six months the king has directed a new policy aimed at regaining the initiative in OPEC for Saudi Arabia, arguing that stability is a better approach.    The new Saudi oil minister, Hisham Nazer, has devoted much of his energies to reorganizing the Saudi oil industry internally. Meanwhile he has deliberately left the king's edicts on general oil policies intact. He doesn't discuss, explain or reinforce them so as to &quot;preserve the weight and influence of the king's word,&quot; said the senior official of an Arab state, who is close to Saudi policies. </TEXT></DOC>
