The judge ruled that the council made contracts on its own behalf without engaging the liabilities of its members. The council had a separate personality and couldn't be said to have acted as agent for its members, the judge said.    The 23-nation tin council collapsed in October 1985 with debts of about #900 million ($1.44 billion) when it ran out of money to buy tin in an effort to support prices.    As a result of yesterday's ruling, the judge said the plaintiffs, led by London Metal Exchange trader J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd., can't seek recovery from the council's member states of the #150 million of losses the plaintiffs claim to have incurred. The suit was brought by 10 tin brokers and six banks against the tin council, its 23 member nations and the Common Market.    Michael Arnold, a spokesman for Tinco Realizations, an informal body representing 11 tin brokers including the 10 involved in the Rayner suit, said the plaintiffs probably would appeal the decision to the appeals court. They have 28 days to decide on the move. The House of Lords would hear any final appeal.    Mr. Arnold said he hoped the case would reach the appeals court by autumn but that the case could drag on beyond 1988 if it goes to the House of Lords.    Meanwhile, officials said the ruling won't have any impact on a suit filed by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. against the London Metal Exchange, seven exchange members and two brokers over the exchange's March 1986 decision to close outstanding tin contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
