The pace of gene discoveries is boosting chances thatmajor breakthroughs in understanding the genetics of humanlife and disease will come far sooner than even the mostoptimistic geneticist would have predicted a few years ago.</LP><TEXT>   The gene searchers are on the trail of genes underlyinghuman ills from Alzheimer's disease and alcoholism to cancer,heart disease and depression. They also are expected to findthe genes for normal human attributes, including baldness.   The project, a loosely coordinated international effortknown as the human genome project, is accelerating forseveral reasons, said many of the world's leading geneticistswho gathered here for a major conference last week.   The endeavor is being speeded by new technology andresearch methods, which allow genes to be located with lesseffort. An accumulation of knowledge has also helped, such asfinding new molecular benchmarks on human genetic materialthat can help narrow the search for specific genes.   Last week some 700 scientists added data on more than 600new-found genes during the four-day gathering. This broughtthe total number of human genes whose location and identityis known to more than 2,500, a hundredfold increase from 1973when the first international genome workshop was held, and a50% increase from the number of human genes that were&quot;mapped&quot; only two years ago.   &quot;The map is truly filling up,&quot; said Ellen Solomon,co-chairman of the conference's U.K. executive committee.   Genes are snippets of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, foundin the nucleus of every human cell. They are the blueprintsfor making the proteins that are the basis of all life, fromthe structural proteins that make up the muscles to theuncounted thousands of enzymes and hormones that carry outsecond-by-second chemical reactions of life. Scientistsbelieve that locating and identifying all 50,000 to 100,000human genes -- known collectively as the genome -- will haveunprecedented medical benefits, first in diagnosis andultimately in treatment of many gene-influenced diseases andconditions.   It's a promise that has seen early returns in areasranging from cystic fibrosis to muscular dystrophy to coloncancer, where the discovery of genes has opened new avenuesof research for treatments and cures.   The majority of the newfound genes described at lastweek's meeting were normal genes involved in life's dailychemistry. While no blockbuster discoveries were announced,the researchers did describe finding genes involved in about80 different clinical disorders, most of which are quiterare, such as a form of inherited epilepsy. The scientistsalso reported progress in efforts to find the genes for aform of early breast cancer that afflicts some families andin understanding the genes in the eye disorder retinitispigmentosa, and in muscular dystrophy.   But it was the sheer volume of new data that was theoutstanding feature of the meeting. It required a book of 350printed pages just to publish the abstracts, orparagraph-length summaries, of the scientific papers read atthe meeting.   James Watson, the Nobel Prize winner who oversees a $200million-a-year genome effort funded by the U.S government,singled out the increasing participation of Japanesescientists as an important factor in the explosive growth ofgenetic data. Two years ago Dr. Watson created a stir bybluntly criticizing the Japanese for their reluctance to jointhe international genome effort. &quot;I think they're going to beserious contributors from now on,&quot; he said.   But Dr. Watson, one of the discoverers of the structure ofDNA, said the presence of a Japanese delegation at lastweek's international workshop for the first time was only thelatest sign of the genome project's growth. At a U.S.conference he organized this year, he said, he was forced forthe first time to turn away prospective attendees. &quot;There aregoing to be a lot more meetings like that,&quot; he added.   Such rapid growth is making current methods for collectingand distributing data seem unwieldy, and will likely forcethe genome researchers to invent new ways to communicate withone another.   The sheer volume of genome research has made it impossiblefor every new discovery to be published in a scientificjournal, the traditional way of spreading scientific news. Ina speech here, Robert Sparkes, a geneticist from theUniversity of California at Los Angeles, spoke of the&quot;explosion&quot; of genetic data and suggested that futurediscoveries should be entered directly into the Genome DataBase, a computerized store of information gleaned from theproject so far. Scientists could then tap in from all overthe world to see what progress had been made.   &quot;There is so much information now that it's becomingdifficult to handle,&quot; said Mr. Sparkes, who noted that thecomputer links that would enable such an approach still don'texist. &quot;I think just getting this data out to the scientificcommunity will be one of our biggest challenges in thefuture.&quot;   While the researchers' knowledge covers, at most, only 5%of the entire genome -- which likely won't be completelymapped until 2006 -- it's still enough to make the idea ofanother big international event a daunting prospect.According to the workshop's organizers, future gatheringswill probably be smaller affairs that deal only with thegenetic data related to individual chromosomes, of which eachhuman cell contains 23 pairs, rather than the entire genome.Eventually, even smaller subdivisions may be needed.   &quot;This meeting is probably the last of the biggies, thelast real multinational jamboree,&quot; said Ian Craig, ageneticist from Oxford University.   But even as individual genome researchers contemplate theneed to narrow their focus, the scope of the overall projectis broadening. Topics at last week's workshop included thetracing of human evolution through genetics, the diagnosisand treatment of diseases, the comparison of human and animalgenomes, and the best way to set up computer systems.   In addition, genome researchers are being lobbied tosupport a number of scientific causes, including thecollection of genetic material from endangered tribes in suchareas as South America's Amazon basin. Such projects areundoubtedly important, but no one here has quite figured outhow to deal with them.   &quot;These meetings are evolving very quickly,&quot; said PeterHarper, a geneticist at the University of Wales. &quot;This onehas been much more medically oriented than previous ones, forexample, and I'm sure we'll see more policy debates in thefuture. It's a measure of our success, of course, and weshould be pleased, but it makes life more complicated.&quot;   ---   Jerry E. Bishop in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
