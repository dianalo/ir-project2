If you do, you may see some pet notions assume a differentappearance, just as people in profile sometimes appear differentlythan they do face to face.   Consider the notion, sometimes expressed by the impatient, thatthe trade deficit be cleaned up once and for all during the nextadministration. Why piddle around; let's get it over with.   But to do so would mean putting people out of work, lowering realincomes and retarding economic growth. This would severely diminishimports. In theory, it could be done _ but not without domestic andprobably worldwide recession.   Forced recessions used to be part of economic policy, whetherstated or denied, and there are pure economists around who stillmaintain that a good recession is a wholesome thing for the tradedefict. Sort of like a purgative.   Today, however, economics is more heavily dosed with politicsthan it was in the immediate post-World War II years. Recessions,though they will happen, are less likely to be a consequence ofabrupt economic policy changes.   Another issue deserving of a different perspective is that ofexporting jobs. It is a contentious one, often used by labor incriticizing Washington's economic policy. By importing, it is said,we're shipping jobs abroad.   To which one economist, Professor William Dunkelberg, responds:``Currently, we employ 62.5 percent of our over-16 population, thehighest proportion in history. If we're losing jobs to foreigners,it's hard to figure where.''   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's business school, suggeststhat if the thesis had validity the evidence would show up as adecline of manufacturing jobs. But it hasn't. Manufacturingemployment is strong again.   True, he says, there's been a job loss in unionized, protectedautomotive and steel industries where, he claims, wages were keptartificially high. But jobs in some other manufacturing areas havegrown, along with productivity.   How about foreign investment in the United States, an issue thatirritates and provokes millions of Americans? As they see it,foreigners are buying up the United States. It's economic warfare,they say, and Americans are losing.   This one demands perspective, to wit:   One reason net foreign investment has grown is that Americans,themselves, are investing more in the United States and less abroad.Again, Dunkelberg explains:   ``The reason we are doing this is the same reason there is moreforeign investment here _ the United States is a very good place toinvest!''   From a historical perspective, he adds, growth has been thestrongest in the United States during periods of strong foreigninvestment. When foreigners seek a good thing, they sometimes do agood thing: They make the country grow.   Moreover, foreign investment leaves hostages. Plants andbuildings they erect in the United States cannot be taken home.``When things sour a bit,'' says the professor, ``We can buy themback at a lower price.''   In the meantime, shouldn't some thought be given to foreigninvestment in terms of jobs provided, wages earned, taxes paid, andproducts put on the competitively priced marketplace?   It's only a slightly different perspective from the conventionalone, but it suggests the possibilities in taking a second look atwhat might at first seem to be one-faceted situations.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Jan. 18</NOTE></DOC>
