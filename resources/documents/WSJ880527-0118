Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, urged Congress yesterday to extend a current moratorium on departures from FSLIC that is due to expire Aug. 10.    He warned that there is a &quot;perception that without the moratorium there may be a major exodus from the FSLIC&quot; to the sounder Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) and 23 cosponsors promptly introduced legislation to extend the moratorium for one year. Rep. St Germain said the measure has &quot;strong bipartisan support.&quot; Although it is opposed by some well-capitalized thrifts, congressional staffers expect the measure to pass.    The action comes a week after FSLIC's auditor, Congress's General Accounting Office, said that the insurance fund, an arm of the Bank Board, is insolvent and will need $26 billion to $36 billion to restore its sick member thrifts to health.    Many FSLIC-insured savings institutions are considering switching insurers because FSLIC's premiums are 2 1/2 times higher than those charged by the FDIC, which mainly insures banks. But fewer than one in three institutions has the 6% capital-to-assets ratio required for admission to the FDIC system, so most want to bar their strongest brethren from exiting FSLIC.    Mr. Wall said departures could impair FSLIC's ability to raise money in the capital markets, where it sells bonds. Departures also would reduce FSLIC's premium income when it most desperately needs the money, Rep. St Germain noted.    Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Wall cited three alternative steps that might stem defections to the FDIC. Fees charged to departing institutions could be raised; they currently are about double the annual insurance premium. Defectors could be barred from the liberal powers allowed some thrift holding companies. And, as the Bank Board already has proposed, FSLIC could shave its fees for the best-capitalized thrifts.    But Mr. Wall gave little comfort to thrifts that are pressing him to start shrinking FSLIC's extra insurance assessments. He testified that the full extra premiums may well be required for &quot;quite some time.&quot; He released a cash-flow forecast that envisioned no cuts in the assessments until Oct. 1, 1995, when they would be eliminated.    Collecting the full premiums during those years would raise a total of $11.5 billion in extra insurance assessments from the industry, more than four times the amount called for in legislation approved by Congress last summer. That law, the Competitive Equality Banking Act, provided for the Bank Board to gradually phase out the extra assessment from 1987 through 1991 unless &quot;severe pressures&quot; on FSLIC made the added funds necessary.    Though the GAO and private analysts call his projections overly optimistic, Mr. Wall said the Bank Board has enough funds for the &quot;near term&quot; and has &quot;a fighting chance&quot; of rescuing all 511 currently insolvent thrifts within five years without added funding. Talk of a taxpayer bailout of the insurance fund, he said, is &quot;premature.&quot;    Mr. Wall also tried to quell criticism that the board is merging some sick Sandamp;Ls with undercapitalized institutions. He said he expects to announce next week the takeover of a savings institution with $1.5 billion in assets by investors who will bring in $100 million of new capital. </TEXT></DOC>
