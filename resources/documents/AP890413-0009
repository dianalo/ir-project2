By official estimates, which are questionable in a country wheregovernment authority collapsed years ago, more than 150,000 peoplehave been killed. Unofficial records put the death toll far higher.   The latest fighting, which began March 8, is primarily aconfrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun, who commands some 20,000mainly Christian troops in Lebanon's fractured army, versus Syriaand its Moslem allies.   Aoun, the Christian prime minister, is in a struggle for powerwith Salim Hoss, who formed a Moslem Cabinet shortly after outgoingPresident Amin Gemayel named Aoun in September. The Christianpremier has vowed to drive out the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.   The renewed fighting ended a two-year lull in the civil warduring which Lebanon's Moslem and leftist militias underlined theirapparently limitless propensity for bloodshed by mauling each otherin internecine battles.   But, as it has repeatedly done in the last 14 years, the civilwar has resumed with a vengeance. Even by Lebanon's standards, theshelling by both sides has been ferocious.   Tens of thousands of shells and rockets have rained down on bothsides. In the worst exchanges, 100 were exploding every minute inthe Christian sector, which has borne the brunt of the violence.   As usual, most of the more than 180 people killed and nearly 700wounded in recent days have been civilians. Police said 60 percentwere Christian. Military casualties have been minimal.   Thousands of Christians, ringed on three sides by hostile forceswith the Mediterranean their main escape route, have fled by sea tonearby Cyprus, while Moslems drove overland to Syria or Jordan forsafety.   For the families left behind, huddled in bomb shelters orbasements _ with food, fuel and power running low _ there appearedto be no end in sight to the civil war that began April 13, 1975.   On that day, Christian gunmen killed 29 Palestinians in a busambush in Beirut after an activist of the rightist ChristianPhalange Party was assassinated.   The origins of the war lie in the Christians' alarm at thegrowth of the Palestinian guerrilla power in Lebanon and Moslemdemands for an equal share of power with the Christians, who haddominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.   At that time, the French deemed that the Christians, mainlyMaronites, were the majority. But since then, the Moslems havebecome the majority, making up an estimated 55 percent of the 4million population. The Christians have refused to surrender theirlong-held privileges.   Since 1975, Lebanon has become the battleground for regionalpowers like Syria and Israel.   The civil war has degenerated into a complex web of overlappingconflicts between rival factions that has defied all attempts toend the fighting, including the ill-fated intervention of theU.S.-led Multinational Force in 1982.   The latest explosion came after Aoun, reasserting the state'slong-lost authority by cracking down on the Christians' mainmilitia, sought to extend it to Moslem sectors of the dividedcountry by blockading illegal militia-run ports that had deprivedthe government of tax revenue.   The Moslem Druse militia, led by warlord Walid Jumblatt,retaliated by shelling the Christian zone.   The Syrians, the main power brokers in Lebanon, came to the aidof their leftist allies, throwing their military might against theChristians.   Aoun, who has long demanded the withdrawal of the Syrians andthe troops they maintain in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate, declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive theSyrians out.   On the face of it, it is an unwinnable contest. Aoun's motivesfor taking on the Syrians and their allies, who outgun andoutnumber the Christians beleaguered in their shrunken heartland,are not clear.   But his objective appears to be to force the Syrians into openwar and draw international attention to a conflict that has ragedfor so long it is hardly noticed.   The Arab League has tried to intervene, but its efforts to finda solution so far have borne little fruit and few expect it to makeheadway.   The French, to whom the francophile Christians havetraditionally turned for help, the Soviets and other Europeanpowers are pressing the Syrians to reach an accomodation with Aoun.   President Hafez Assad of Syria cannot be seen to be humbled bypulling out of a country he considers part of Syria's orbit.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has served notice thatWashington plans no new initiative in Lebanon.   The United States is still haunted by the deaths of more than240 Marines killed by a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber and otherfailures.   The fate of 15 Western hostages, nine of them American, held bypro-Iranian Shiite extremists may be behind the U.S. reluctance toget involved in the Lebanese quicksands again.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR`S NOTE: The writer, chief correspondent in Beirut for TheAssociated Press, has covered Middle East affairs for 20 years.</TEXT></DOC>
