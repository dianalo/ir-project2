It's entitled &quot;The Deadly Silence.&quot;    The title may be overdrawn, but it points to an unusual situation in the 1988 presidential campaign: Though reports of rioting by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Israel's hard-nosed military response have filled newspapers and television newscasts for weeks, they get little attention on the campaign trail.    &quot;It's remarkable,&quot; says Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. Some Middle East analysts decry the lack of attention, though Ms. Kipper argues that it's probably for the best because the candidates might only exacerbate tensions by politicizing the explosive Palestinian problem.    Candidates have made some comments, of course, though mostly they speak up only when asked. Their remarks tend to be studiously vague, and any criticism of Israel is muted. In a recent debate, for instance, Republican Sen. Robert Dole decried Palestinians for &quot;taunting&quot; Israeli troops and then chided the Israelis for using &quot;excessive force&quot; in reaction. On the Democratic side, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has addressed the issue most frequently, calling for both a Palestinian homeland and security guarantees for Israel, and former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt devoted one little-noticed speech to the Middle East in the waning days of his failed campaign.    But in general, Israeli-Palestinian tensions attract less attention than a host of vague campaign topics such as personal character or arcane issues such as the computation of Social Security payments for people born between 1917 and 1921.    Of several explanations, the first and most obvious is that candidates worry they may say something about Israel's tactics in suppressing Palestinian unrest that offends the politically powerful supporters of the Jewish state. &quot;There's obviously an element of truth that all politicians, week in and week out, campaign among members of the Jewish community,&quot; acknowledges John Buckley, a campaign spokesman for Republican Rep. Jack Kemp, a staunch backer of Israel. &quot;But at the same time, it's pretty clear there is a broad consensus among non-Jews in this country that Israel is a good and loyal ally.&quot;    Candidates usually spend much time in a presidential campaign building their pro-Israel credentials, and they are reluctant to undo that. In this campaign, for instance, four candidates -- Sen. Dole and Rep. Kemp among the Republicans and Democrats Rep. Richard Gephardt and Sen. Paul Simon -- were co-sponsors of a recently passed bill ordering the closure of Palestine Liberation Organization offices in New York and Washington. Sen. Simon was a co-sponsor, even though a few years ago, before he was a presidential candidate, he wrote in a book: &quot;We should be willing to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization.&quot;    But the strength of the Israeli lobby is only a partial explanation. The presidential campaign still is at an early stage, when candidates are posturing about &quot;leadership&quot; and failing to address many foreign-policy issues in any detail.    And while the Palestinian rioting has captured American attention, it doesn't seem to have aroused much public appetite for American action. Voters appear to have little faith left in the oft-discussed Middle East &quot;peace process,&quot; so neither they nor journalists are pressing candidates to explain how they would get Israelis and Palestinians into negotiations. When Mr. Babbitt gave what aides considered a fairly tough and specific Middle East speech, for instance, &quot;we got maybe one or two paragraphs of ink,&quot; recalls Babbitt spokesman Michael McCurry. And mail on the subject to congressional offices, a good indicator of public interest, hasn't been running particularly high.    Also, the American Jewish community itself is divided over Israel's tactics in suppressing Palestinian unrest, adding to candidates' instinctive caution. Absent pressure to be specific, candidates prefer to avoid missteps they may regret later.    &quot;I think in part there's a lack of courage and a lack of vision that plagues most candidates,&quot; says James Zogby, executive director of the Arab American Institute. &quot;They aren't convinced at this point that political courage and conviction can win an election.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
