Physiological timeis defined as chronological time divided by species body weight to the1/4 power. We demonstrate the usefulness of this time scaling of themulticompartment physiological pharmacokinetic model by using it to modelthe inhalation of the volatile chlorinated hydrocarbon tetrachloroethylenein mice, rats, and humans. 8 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
