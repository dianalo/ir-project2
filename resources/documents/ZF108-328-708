 The product requires at least a '286 PC with aminimum of 640K and runs under Windows.andM;Version 1.11 now has 102 vector-based outline fonts with a conversion utilityto convert third-party fonts into Corel's screen format.andP;  Also new is theinclusion of over 300 pieces of clip art, gathered from (and credited to) 12clip-art suppliers.andP;  In return for crediting the suppliers, Corel hasobtained the clip art free of charge to create a useful package of sourcedartwork with no cost.andM;A range of file formats can be imported into CorelDraw, including videoformat.andP;  Users can view type choices on the screen in the selection box,prior to actually committing text to a specific font and style.andP;  Type can besized in tenth-point increments up to 999.9!andP;  The faces are from Adobe, buthave been renamed to avoid copyright difficulties.andM;Because the package works with outline fonts and not bitmaps, text can beinteractively kerned on the screen.andP;  Moreover, even if a piece of textcomprises a collection of characters all at different angles to the baseline, the text can still be edited.andP;  Added text will take on the attributesof the initial character in a sequence.andM;New are the import/export filters to include TIFF format, Gem, AutoCad DXF,Megafile, IBM PIF, Illustrator and PIC.andP;  Export formats include EPSF, PCF andSCODL (Scanned Conversion Object Description Language), the standard for filmrecorders.andP;  Also new are the VideoShow and WordPerfect Graphic features.andM;A Pantone license comes free with the product.andP;  Colors on the screen can nowbe merged across a graduated spectrum from one to the other for some verypretty effects; these merges can be at any angle.andM;The package costs $595 and is available in English, French and German.andP;  TheUK distributor is Frontline; Software Solutions is the Dutch distributor.andO;Also on hand was the OS/2 version of CorelDraw, which is still in betatesting.andP;  This version is expected to be nearly the same (90%, we were told)as the Windows version and to be available in June.andM;Hewlett-Packard features IIIandM;Hewlett-Packard's booth was filled with recently announced products: theLaserJet Series III and the PostScript cartridge for it, a new softwarepackage to be included with the ScanJet Plus, and so on.andP;  We spent some timegoing over the new scanner software and filling in product details about theII, IIP, IID and III.andM;It comes as no surprise that the HP Series II will gradually be phased outand the Series III will replace it.andP;  Hewlett-Packard will stop taking ordersfor the II in June or July; it hopes that the fact that the III's list priceis $300 cheaper than the II's will help decrease demand for the II.andM;A LocaTalk interface will be available for the IIP in May for a cost of $275,which, coupled with the PostScript cartridge scheduled for April release,will make it possible to buy a printer with Adobe PostScript, PCL and anLocalTalk interface for a list price of under $2,500--though you will almostsurely need the 2-MB upgrade that costs $990, bringing the total nearer$3,500.andP;  THE IIP only comes with 512K of memory, and the 1-MB upgrade wouldprobably not give users enough memory to do complex pages, so buying the 2-MBupgrade is a good idea for those who intend to buy the PostScript cartridgewhen it becomes available.andM;HP plans to offer an Appletalk interface for the III at about the same timethe IIP version is released, also priced at $275.andP;  That would mean you couldconnect your III directly to an Appletak network.andP;  As with the IIP, you wouldneed to buy the 2-MB upgrade ($990) and the PostScript cartridge.andP;  For thoseof you with the IID, you can use the HP PostScript cartridge as well.andP;  HPrecommends upgrading to 4 MB if you are going to do duplexing while printingPostScript pages.andM;Upgrading a Series II.andP;  We were looking forward to the release of thePostScript cartridge, thinking that we would get one for our aging Series IIprinter.andP;  We were disappointed to learn that HP will definitely not bereleasing one for the II.andP;  Why not?andP;  According to company representatives atthe show, it is due to technical limitations inherent in the II, although youcan use the cartridge with a Series II that has been upgraded to a SeriesIII.andP;  All is not lost, however.andP;  Pacific Data Products announced a PhoenixTechnologies PostScript emulation cartridge designed for the Series II, alongwith another that works on the IID, IIP, and III,andM;Answers at your fingertips.andP;  There are times when you have a simple questionabout a product and you would like to get a simple answer without having towait on hold for 15 minutes or being bounced electronically from one voicemailbox to another and then being told to leave a message.andP;  As annoying asthis is for the user, it can be just as annoying for the vendor to have allhis tech-support lines tied up with routine questions.andM;As a way around this, HP has started a new service available to anyone withaccess to a fax machine.andP;  Dialing (208) 344-4809 gets you a programmed voicetelling you how to get information about III drivers and fonts or softwareinformation about any of the HP printers.andP;  You need to call using the voicehandset on your fax machine and then listen to the selections available.andO;After you make your selection from the spoken menu, the voice instructs youto press the start button on the fax machine and hang up.andP;  A informationpacket prints out of your fax.andP;  The III driver packet even has a driverrequest from you can fill in and fax back to HP.andP;  There is no charge for theservice; the only costs are those normally associated with using your faxmachine.andM;Paintbrush for ScanJet.andP;  PC Paintbrush IV Plus will now be bundled with everyScanJet Plus, in addition to the HP software that was always included.andP;  TheZSoft product is a relatively new version of Paintbrush and has severalsophisticated features and tools.andP;  Full gray-scale TIFF compatibility hasbeen added.andP;  (Formerly, the product only supported black and white TIFF.)andO;Gamma correction abilities also have been added, along with an interestingfeature whereby the user can construct gray palettes and apply them toscanned gray-scale images.andM;Unfortunately, the program does not have any masking capabilities, so anychanges you make apply to the whole image.andP;  You can mix color and gray scalein one image by selecting a shade of gray and telling the program to changeit to a specific color wherever that shade of gray appears in the image.andP;  Asyou might imagine, this can lead to some interesting-looking images.andP;  ZSoftshowed one practical use for this feature: coloring just the text in ascanned image, because the shading on the text was different enough from therest of the image.andM;Next peripherals arriveandM;In the PostScript output room, located outside the main exhibit floor, wereNext cubes and Adobe PostScript output devices connected via a Cayman SystemsGatorBox running an alpha version of a program called Gator Print.andP;  Theprogram will be available to the public in May or June and will retail for$595.andP;  In its booth, Next was showing how its system can operate side by sidewith Macs and PCs in an Ethernet network, and it was showcasing several newthird-party software programs and peripherals.andM;TextArt.andP;  TextArt, from Stone Design, is an engaging text manipulationprogram for the Next cube that allows the user to do anything to text thatcan be done using PostScript commands--and (thanks to Display PostScript andthe Next screen) you can see a very close approximation of your creation onthe screen before you print it out.andP;  We plan to talk about the program moreafter we have had a chance to put it through its paces, but we find it easyto work with and much faster than similar Macintosh products.andM;Basic drawing tools are included with the program, so you can add lines andcircles with and without fills to your text.andP;  TIFF and EPS files can beimported and combined with text from the program.andP;  You can also export filesin TIFF or EPS format.andM;The program costs $375, or $310 if you send in an optical disc with theorder.andP;  It is not available in Mac or PC versions.andP;  Andrew Stone, presidentof the company, said that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, torecreate all of the program's features on either of these two platformsbecause the Next has resources, such as virtual memory, that the others donot.andM;Not your ordinary gamma correction.andP;  HSD showed a new flatbed scanner, donein Next Black, called the Scan-X 600.andP;  It has something we haven't seenbefore in low-end gray-scale scanners.andP;  The Scan-X 600 is a 300-dpi, 8-bitscanner (interpolation gives it 600 dpi for line art--hence the name), andthat's nothing new.andP;  What is new and exciting is a feature HSD calls GreySpectrum enhancement.andM;With only 256 levels of gray to distribute over one scanned image, scannermanufacturers must decide how to distribute them.andP;  Imagine trying to file1,000 sheets of paper into 256 folders; some of the file folders will have tohave more than one sheet of paper in them.andP;  Similarly, a gray-scale scannermanufacturer may allot two or three levels for the very dark or very lightshades, then distribute the remaining 200 or so evenly.andP;  No consensus existsamong scanner manufacturers as to the most effective allotment, and in anyevent no one pattern will be good for every kind of photograph, so gammacorrection is offered in some scanning and image editing software.andM;Gamma correction allows the user to shift the distribution pattern up anddown after the final scan to bring out detail, but results are limitedbecause the pattern the pattern itself cannot be altered.andM;With the HSD scanner, the user can do a preliminary scan and then change therange of the 256 possible values before doing the final scan.andP;  For example,if you are scanning a photograph of a black dog standing in a dark room, youcan tell the scanner to allot all 256 levels within the dark gray range.andO;This ability is a definite step forward, and we would encourage allgray-scale scanner manufacturers with products in this price range (Xerox's7650 can do it, but it costs about $10,000) to look into adding similarcapabilities.andM;No OCR software is yet available for the scanner, although a sheet feeder is.andO;The scanner has a standard SCSI port, so it could work with a Mac if theappropriate software were written.andP;  HSD's president, David W. Peter, saidthat the company will continue to focus on Next products for a while beforeit turns its attention to writing Mac and PC software.andM;The scanner, cable and software are available at Businessland stores for aretail price of $2,195.andP;  The educational/institutional price is $1,495.andM;External devices for the Next.andP;  Dayna Communications and Pacific Micro haveannounced MS-DOS to Next external floppy drives.andP;  Dayna offers both 3.5&quot; and5.25&quot; formats, in high and low densities.andP;  The unit, named DaynaFile, comesin either single or dual configuration and attaches to the Next via thecube's SCSI port.andP;  Prices range from $750 to $1,105 and include two softwareapplications that allow the device to mount Next disks and to copy MS-DOSfiles to the Next system.andP;  The Pacific Microdevice is available only in a3.5&quot; single drive configuration and retails for $999.andM;Pacific Micro has also announced an external hard disk for the Next that alsoattaches via the sCSI port.andP;  The chassis retails for $999 and can be equippedwith two 330- or 660-MB Winchester drives for a combined maximum size of 1.2GB.andM;Pacific Data adds to HP lineandM;Pacific Data introduced several new additions to their line of cartridges forHP and Canon printers.andP;  (see below) Each of the PostScript emulationcartridges includes Bitstream equivalents of the Apple NT standard 35 we'vecome to expect.andP;  In addition, all of the PacificPage products now supportAdobe Type 1 fonts.andM;New Pacific Data products at a glance:andM;The software included with the two MacPage products is interesting because itincludes a PCL driver along with the PostScript driver, so you can use the HPprinter as either a PCL printer or a PostScript printer.andM;Pacific Data Products also announced that during this quarter it will startto ship compatible Series III memory boards at prices competitive with HP.andM;Ultimate moves Poststrip to MacandM;Ultimate Technographics, which serves the market for commercial-qualitytypography, has developed a program for outputting PostScript files insignatures ready to be imaged on a plate and printed.andP;  We have covered the PCversion of Poststrip in the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, but wethought this might be a good time to mention the new Mac version in thisreport.andM;Poststrip enables the operator to specify other printing information--whetherthe job will be saddle stitched or perfect bound, how many pages eachsignature will contain, etc.andP;  It then calculates how the pages will beconfigured and displays the page imposition on the screen.andM;The functionality on the Mac and the PC is basically the same.andP;  Pricing isidentical: $3,995 for a program to handle one desktop application, $9,995 forthree, or $19,995 for the entire package.andM;Ultimate is looking for dealers or OEM arrangements for Poststrip.andM;Xerographic Laser ImagesandM;We left the booth feeling like we'd emerged from a vaporous cloud, but we hadthe output samples in our hands, printed before our very eyes.andP;  The printquality looked considerably better than any normal 300-dpi output.andM;Zerographic Laser Images, a small brand-new company headquartered in Woburn,Massachusetts, has developed an AT bus adapter that outputs to the Canon SXengine.andP;  The company claims an effective resolution of 2,400 X 2,400 dpi(!)andO;and further claims a print speed rate equivalent to or better than theprinter's speed at 300 X 300 dpi.andP;  Furthermore, 256 shades of gray arepossible, although dithering as we know it is not used.andP;  Currently, XLIintends to market the device and technology to printer OEMS and VARs and todevelop the technology so that it will work with any laser printer.andM;How does this magical device work?andP;  Well, nitty gritty details were notforthcoming, possibly because the device has not yet been patented, but wegot the gist of how it works.andP;  As most users know, vertical resolution cannotexceed 300 dpi on most models of the Canon SX engine (400 dpi for somemodels); it is governed by the relative speeds of paper motion and laser beamdeflection.andP;  Horizontal resolution can be changed, though, because the lasercan be turned on and off at will.andP;  XLI claims that it can maneuver the beamso that it images a spot as a small as to 1/38,000 of an inch.andP;  It is thuspossible to place spots very close together, thus generating different-sizedots and dots in varying shades of gray; you can think of this as &quot;microdithering.&quot;andP;  Print samples do show dots of various sizes.andP;  A ditheringpattern is visible in the mid-tone range--something Vincent J. Spoto, companypresident and chairman, claims will not happen in future revisions.andM;Little more can be said without some hands-on experience, but it does bringto mind the prediction Brian Anderson made during his talk at the Seminars:that within this decade true 1,000-dpi plain-paper printers will becomewidely available.andP;  We'll keep you informed.andM;New type alteration from ZSoftandM;Tucked into a small bit of space in The Company's booth was a ZSoftrepresentative showing a product called Soft Type.andP;  Scheduled for releasethis month, the product allows you to load a typeface and alter it to createa font.andP;  For example, you can take one of the 62 typefaces that come with theproduct or any ZSoft OTL and change its enhancements.andP;  You can make it bold,italic, or bold italic if it isn't already.andP;  You can also rotate, expand orslant text, as well as add shadows or create outline text.andM;This is a Windows only product, and the ZSoft representative said that itwill run with 640 KB of memory but recommended at least 2 MB.andP;  The programsupports Adobe Type 1 fonts, and Bitstream font support is planned.andP;  It alsoworks with any font created with Publisher's Type Foundry.andP;  You can outputyour creations to an HP LaserJet, PostScript device or even any Epsonnine-pin printer, should you have any desire to do so.andM;One of the near things about this relatively inexpensive product ($199) isthat it can do the time-consuming portion of its work, computing what you'vetold it to do, as a background process while you work with any other Windowsproduct.andP;  But if you like really big type, you're out of luck.andP;  Its sizerange is from 1 to 72 points, in 0.01-point increments.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
