COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer-enhanced X-ray technique could helpdoctors diagnose Alzheimer's disease and paranoid schizophrenia byallowing them, in effect, to look not just at the brain but at themind, radiologists say.   The technique, called SPECT, ``may turn out to be the singlemost important imaging method we have to diagnose Alzheimer's,''Dr. Frederick J. Bonte said Monday at the 75th general assembly ofthe Radiological Society of North America.   ``Traditional imaging methods such as computed tomography andmagnetic resonance haven't been able to contribute much to thediagnosis of Alzheimer's, except to rule out other conditions thatmay cause Alzheimer's-like symptoms,'' he said.   But SPECT actually gives images of the physiological processesin the brain, rather than merely the organ's structure, said Bonte,director of the Nuclear Medicine Research Center at the Universityof Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.   Using SPECT, he and his co-workers accurately have identifiedabout 150 of 170 dementia patients as victims of Alzheimer's, anincurable disease of aging that afflicts up to four millionAmericans.   Alzheimer's causes memory lapses, confusion, loss of ability tofunction and eventually death, and often goes undiagnosed for twoor three years because people wrongly attribute early symptoms tonormal effects of aging.   Though no treatment exists for the disease, SPECT could bevaluable in separating treatable types of dementia that resembleAlzheimer's from actual Alzheimer's, Bonte said. Also, whenresearchers do devise treatments, SPECT could be used to monitortheir effectiveness, he said.   In SPECT, an acronym for single photon emission computedtomography, patients are injected with a radio-pharmaceutical, achemical compound that emits a small amount of radiation.   The chemical travels to the brain, where it settles into thetissues in direct proportion to the amount of blood flow in thatarea of the brain, Bonte said.   ``Alzheimer's is characterized by abnormalites in brain bloodflow,'' he said. ``Early in the disease, brain cells begin to dieand this reduces the flow of blood in that portion of the brain.These areas show up very well with SPECT.''   SPECT scanning could become generally available within a year ortwo, he said. It takes less than four minutes to perform, and costsabout $450, compared with $800 for a CAT scan and $1,000 for MRI,Bonte said.   The technique uses a machine that would be affordable to mostcommunity hospitals and could be used for constructing images oforgans besides the brain, he said.   Dr. Theodore R. Simon, deputy chief of nuclear medicine at theClinical Center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,Md., reported that SPECT also has proven useful in diagnosing orconfirming diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia and otherpsychiatric disorders, such as depression.   ``Until now, psychiatric diseases have been diagnosedsubjectively, primarily through clinical observation of behavior,''Simon said. ``SPECT provides an objective technique to view thephysical evidence of schizophrenia in the brain and confirm theclinical diagnosis.''   Schizophrenia afflicts an estimated two to five of every 1,000Americans, causing symptoms that may include impairment inthinking, delusions, hallucinations, changes in emotions andchanges in behavior, according to the National Alliance for theMentally Ill.   Paranoid schizophrenia is a subtype of the disease characterizedby feelings of persecution, or less commonly, grandiosity,according to the Arlington, Va.-based organization.</TEXT></DOC>
