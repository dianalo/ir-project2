Many producers of natural gas, who for years lobbied toloose themselves from government price regulations, are nowcampaigning to restrict the free market that's settingrecord-low prices. The industry is pressing regulators inseveral states to curb production, hoping for higher profitmargins, or at least a boost to the breakeven level that'seluding many producers.</LP><TEXT>   A few gas concerns have already trimmed production ontheir own in recent weeks. Now, some state legislators andregulatory officials are discussing enforcement of suchaction in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana -- states thatproduce 43% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. In fact,those states supply a greater proportion of gas to the U.S.than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries doesoil to the world. Domestic gas producers have long promisedto rescue the U.S. energy market from that cartel.   Thus, the regional push to drive up prices smacks ofbitter irony to some. &quot;Listening to domestic gas producerstoday is almost like hearing OPEC speak,&quot; says Vinod Dar, agas industry consultant based in Washington. &quot;For producersin a free market to say we don't like the price and bandtogether -- sure sounds like a cartel,&quot; he adds.   Last week's prices to producers hovered at around $1.05 athousand cubic feet, less than half the price in January1990. For many companies, the break-even price is about$1.50.   Some analysts say the U.S. gas industry is going through amarket-driven shakeout that will pare the current ranks of5,000 producers to 2,500 in the next two or three years. Gasindustry officials argue that they need government help toprevent such a loss of jobs and to keep enough producers inbusiness to avoid shortages of gas in the future.   Julian Martin, executive vice president of the TexasIndependent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, saysmembership in his group has already fallen 33% from a decadeago to about 3,000 companies. &quot;We have a huge problem withoversupply,&quot; he says, adding that today's gas prices arebelow drilling costs for new wells and are the lowest in morethan a decade.   The excess production of gas must be halted, said LenaGuerrero, chairwoman of the Texas Railroad Commission. &quot;We'rewasting it,&quot; she said. Unless prices are shored up, thedwindling number of producers means &quot;we'll run out of gas andwill have a dramatic shortfall in the mid1990s,&quot; Mr. Martinsaid.   But critics say such price controls will further erode thepublic image of gas. The industry's reputation forreliability has suffered since 1977, when businesses andschools in 22 states closed amid regulation-induced gasshortages and lack of heat during a record cold winter.Limiting supply on purpose &quot;may be something people won'tforget,&quot; says Mr. Dar. &quot;If gas isn't perceived asuser-friendly, a lot of customers will find alternatives.&quot;   Many already have. The gas industry's share of the $240billion energy market has slipped to about 24% from 33% in1970. Mr. Dar speculates that artificially high gas pricesmay discourage the building of new cogeneration power plants.&quot;Driving up prices could have a chilling effect on new gasplants -- the best hope producers have for an expanded marketin the 1990s,&quot; he says.   The gas industry is fearful of a consumer backlash. &quot;Inall probability they'll monitor the system through the wintermonths so we don't deny the little old lady in tennissneakers in Michigan her gas,&quot; says Mr. Martin.   That promise won't be good enough for consumers, predictsRobin Shoemaker, an energy analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers. &quot;Any attempt to raise prices with the governmentlimiting production won't withstand legal challenges. Almostany form of this will be determined to be illegal restraintof trade,&quot; he says.   But some regulators seem oblivious to consumers, at leastso far. &quot;I don't think you'll hear much from consumers inOklahoma,&quot; says Jack Davidson, oil and gas division managerof the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulatesproducers in that state. He reasons that 70% of the gasproduced in Oklahoma is shipped to buyers in other states.   If such provincialism irks distant customers, that's anecessary risk, says Michael Thompson, director of theOklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. &quot;The industry isdesperate. We're like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid inthe movie deciding to jump off the cliff into a river. Sowhat if this idea won't float . . . the fall of prices willkill us anyway,&quot; he says.   But some in the industry oppose limiting production, andthe battle lines are being drawn between the smallerindependents and major oil companies for whom gas issometimes a No. 3 business behind their chemical operations.Big Oil is lobbying against governmental curbs on gasproduction. Chevron Corp., the biggest U.S. gas producer,says enforced limits would hurt its ability to sign customersto long-term contracts because they would &quot;kill theconfidence&quot; of major industrial and utility customers in theseller's ability to deliver.   But state officials in the gas patch may be more inclinedto listen to their local constituents, mostly independents,than major oil companies, many of whose headquarters arelocated elsewhere with exploration activities focusedoverseas.   To be sure, Chevron and some other major companies havecut production in recent times due to poor market conditions.In fact, the industry giants have collectively cut productionby about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day, about 3% of the U.S.total, according to an estimate by Natural Gas Intelligence,an industry newsletter. But analysts estimate the reductiontotal would have to about double to start driving up pricesin the spot market and in futures trading.   Such reductions could be well on the way if the proposedOklahoma plan is approved by regulators there. It could slashthe allowable production from certain wells by 50%, says astate official.   Yet such cuts can't stop gas producers in at least threeareas that want to sell even more gas in the U.S.: Canada,the Gulf of Mexico and New Mexico, which together account forabout 39% of gas consumed in America. A newly opened pipelinefrom Canada makes gas from that country more available in theNortheast. Many New Mexico producers can afford to sell gasat below-market prices because of federal tax credits for thediscovery of certain supplies. Gas from the Gulf of Mexicowaters is under federal jurisdiction.   Thus, the gas companies pressing for production curbs maybe overestimating the power of such action if it's limited tothe traditional oil and gas patch. &quot;They're flat-earthersdoing business in a round world,&quot; says Norman Higby a gasindustry consultant in Menlo Park, Calif.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Cattle futures prices are expected to plunge this morningon the contents of a U.S. Agriculture Departmentcattle-on-feed report released after trading Friday.   The report said the number of cattle on feed lots in 13Midwest and Plains states is now 94% of what it was a yearago, higher than many analysts were expecting. In addition,cattle marketings between October and December were 100% ofthe year-earlier number, and October-through-Decemberplacements were at 96%. Both these numbers are higher thanwhat analysts had predicted.   &quot;This report is going to have a definite downward impacton futures prices,&quot; said Dan Vaught, livestock analyst forA.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis.   This week traders will also be anticipating the contentsof a Department of Agriculture cattle inventory report dueout on Friday. Meat packers facing negative profit marginsare expected to cut back sharply on slaughter this week,producing choppy prices in cattle futures trading.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          After falling 3.55 cents a pound last week, coffee futuresmight bounce back early this week on profit-taking by traderswith short positions, said Guillermo Sarmiento, president ofSarmiento Group, Miami coffee consultants. Traders with shortpositions, or bets that the price will fall, take profits bybuying offsetting contracts. But prices are likely to retreatagain by the end of the week, perhaps falling to the 68 centto 70 cent range, he predicted.   On Friday, coffee for March delivery ended 2.45 centslower at 72.15 cents, a new life-of-contract low.   Prospects have dimmed for a quota or other price-boostingplan emerging out of this week's meeting of the InternationalCoffee Organization. Colombia, which took a leadership rolein organizing coffee export retention plans ahead of ICOmeetings last fall, is taking a back seat this time around,Mr. Sarmiento said. And Brazilian producers and exporters aredeeply split over whether to support a new quota program, headded.   The diminished possibility of a quota led to heavy sellingby many producers, who had held back selling coffee on thehope that headway would be made at this week's meeting, Mr.Sarmiento said.</TEXT></DOC>
