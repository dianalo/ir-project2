(DEC) VMS andUltrix, Sun Microsystems Inc. workstations, PS/2s, Macs, SciTex workstationsand Novell NetWare.andM;However, other manufacturers offer more flexibility at more modest prices.andM;The host adapter proved problematic.andP;  The now-standard 16-bit Future DomainCorp. adapter proved incompatible with the Everex Systems Inc.andP;  Step 386/25.andO;Alphatronix supplied its older Seagate Technology host adapter as areplacement for PC Week testing.andP;  The company is modifying its drives forcompatibility with persnickety computers, officials said.andM;The 8-bit interface of the Seagate host adapter apparently did not compromisebenchmark performance.andP;  When the system's data verification was switched off,it demonstrated the fastest transfer speed of any drive.andM;Alphatronix endows the Inspire system with one of the easiest installationsystems around.andP;  A single program configures the host adapter, makes thenecessary system modifications and copies files to the host's hard disk inless than a minute.andP;  Unfortunately, the system must modify DOS versions olderthan 4.0 to handle larger clusters.andM;It may also alter the host system's Format utility to add optical support.andO;Those who fear modification to DOS may want to steer clear.andM;Although the end result is convenient -- one format command handles anymedium -- it's not very flexible.andP;  The standard Inspire system supportsneither multiple partitions nor booting from optical media.andP;  Bootableversions can be custom-manufactured, however.andP;  The media is available aseither one 295M-byte partition (with 512-byte-per-sector ISO cartridges) orone 323M-byte partition (with 1,024-byte-per-sector ISO cartridges).andM;Alphatronix Inc., located in Research Triangle Park, N.C., can be reached at(919) 544-0001.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;For someone who is trying to organize large projects of 70M to 80M bytes,the Alphatronix is a godsend,&quot; said Bob Atwell, a research strategist for theInstitute for Defense Analysis, a research and development center inAlexandria, Va.andM;Atwell particularly liked Inspire because it supports the VAX, the Macintosh,Sun workstations and PCs.andP;  &quot;The maintenance contract for one year from DECcosts what it does to buy an Inspire unit.andP;  It just makes good economicalsense,&quot; Atwell said.andM;&quot;It's a particularly good device,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The drivers don't conflict withthe software.andP;  I do a lot of work with DOS extender, Windows and NetWareshells, and the Inspire works fine.&quot;andM;Atwell had to have a chassis repaired in his Novell network, and found theAlphatronix a great medium for backup.andM;&quot;I was able to take a copy of the disk and bring up an optical attached tothe network,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We had the system up right away with Inspire.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
