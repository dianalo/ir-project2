Hastings, an FBI agent told a Housesubcommittee conducting impeachment proceedings against the judge.   ``There is nothing to lead me to believe that it could have beenany other source than Judge Hastings,'' agent Christopher Mazzellatestified Wednesday before the subcommittee on criminal justice.Mazzella said the three investigations into labor racketeering andpublic corruption had to be ended for fear of endangering the livesof undercover agents and informants.   He said Hastings approved a 30-day wiretap on July 15, 1985, andreceived ``progress reports'' on it every seven days.   On Aug. 15, the FBI applied to Hastings for an extension of thetap, attaching an affidavit containing references to Dade CountyMayor Steve Clark and a man named Kevin ``Waxy'' Gordon, who was atarget of one of the probes.   Mazzella, who was in charge of the probes, said theinvestigations became tainted when Clark told Gordon of informationhe said he received from Hastings. Gordon surmised that the onlyway anyone would know the information was from a wiretap.   Mazzella said the cases involved the local longshoremen's unionin zoning code cases in Hialeah and police selling drugs in NorthBay Village. He said the wiretap was involved in all three cases.   Hastings, who still sits on the federal bench in Miami, has nothad a chance to rebut the allegations before the subcommittee. Herefused to discuss the case Wednesday with reporters outside thehearing room.   Mazzella said he could not find any statement to a lawenforcement officer in which Hastings either confirmed or deniedthe allegations. The agent said reporter Bryan Duffy of the MiamiHerald told the FBI he discussed the allegation with Hastings onMarch 25, 1986, but that Hastings did not say whether he was thesource of the leak.   The impeachment proceedings against Hastings stem from a briberycase in Florida involving Washington attorney William Borders.   Borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a $150,000 bribe forHastings in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convictedracketeers.   In a separate trial in 1983, Hastings was acquitted of thebribery conspiracy charges. But a five-member panel of theAtlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Florida,concluded there was convincing evidence that Hastings actually tookpart in the bribery scheme and then attempted a cover-up by lyingunder oath and manufacturing evidence.   The panel's findings were endorsed unanimously by the JudicialConference of the United States, the chief policy-making body ofthe federal judiciary, and forwarded to House leaders in March 1987with the advice that ``consideration of impeachment may bewarranted.''   The judiciary subcommittee must determine whether Hastingscommitted the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrantimpeachment. If Hastings is impeached by the House, the Senate willconduct a trial to determine whether he should be removed fromoffice.</TEXT></DOC>
