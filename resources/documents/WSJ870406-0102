The reason: The ferry terminal is being rebuilt and commuters had abused ferry staff about the inconvenience.    The raise, equivalent to $15.50 a week until completion of renovations this year, is to compensate for the unpleasantness.    Australia's industrial disputes frequently border on the bizarre.    Last year for instance, male flight attendants threatened to disrupt Ansett Transport Industries, one of the country's two major domestic airlines, during the Easter holiday period because they wanted to wear short-sleeved shirts. The attendants won the right to bare arms, even though Ansett's management felt short sleeves didn't fit the carrier's image.    At around the same time, Qantas Airways passengers found themselves stranded in Sydney overnight because flight attendants walked off the job over the issue of germs in the international carrier's hot towels.    &quot;This kind of self-inflicted stupidity is a product of a 1950s and 1960s we've-never-had-it-so-good syndrome,&quot; says David Abba, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales. During that boom era, he says, Australia's work force got used to winning concessions.    But with falling world prices for most of Australia's exports, a sagging domestic dollar and soaring interest rates, it isn't like that any more. In September, the government met with unions and employers' representatives to find ways of changing some of the work practices that are damaging Australia's competitiveness.    &quot;Now that we're out-banana-ing the banana republics with the size of our national debt, we have to do something very quickly to change our attitude,&quot; Mr. Abba says.    With most wage increases decided by a national tribunal, Australia's 57%-unionized labor force has turned to winning improvements at the work place. Safety standards have been a particular focus of industrial action and a study of the construction industry, for example, shows that fatal accidents on Australian building sites are four times fewer than on U.S. projects.    But in some cases, a combination of strong unionism and weak management has led to demands that are more laughable than laudable.    In 1981, workers building an entertainment center adjacent to Sydney's Chinatown demanded daily &quot;tea money&quot; from their employer. They complained that appetizing aromas wafting from the nearby restaurants were &quot;creating hardship in the gastronomical expectations of the employees.&quot; (The claim was later dropped.)    Even organized labor acknowledges the silliness of some practices -- like the &quot;one on, all on&quot; rule at some construction sites that everone must be offered overtime even if only one worker is needed.    &quot;I suppose there are still some people in the trade-union movement trying to defend that,&quot; says Tim North, an organizer with the Labor Council of New South Wales, &quot;and where management isn't on top of the job they'll probably continue to get away with it.&quot;    Mr. North, whose organization represents 140 trade unions, says &quot;there's nothing to be gained by seeking to defend the indefensible.&quot; But he says companies are unrealistic if they think traditions can be changed overnight without consultation and discussion. &quot;You can't just say it'll be different on Monday than it was on Friday,&quot; he says.    Some employers disagree. &quot;Negotiations can take years and when you're hemorrhaging you don't have years,&quot; says Wayne Gilbert, general manager of the South East Queensland Electricity Board. In 1985 he presided over one of the toughest stands ever taken against a union in Australia, when about 1,000 workers were fired for refusing to end a strike.    Nevertheless, Mr. Gilbert blames the proliferation of costly work practices largely on &quot;weak and remote management,&quot; especially in large companies and mature industries. &quot;Abuse of union power isn't the main cause,&quot; he says.    Until 1983, Mr. Gilbert worked for a beer-making concern that had allowed unusual work practices to creep into its breweries. When he took the job as chief executive officer of Tooth andamp; Co.'s two Sydney breweries in 1978, Mr. Gilbert says he was surprised to find a &quot;pat man&quot; on his staff. The pat man's job was to sweep up the droppings left by cart horses -- even though the breweries hadn't used horses to cart beer for more than 20 years.    A rule that only electricians could start electric motors had become so rigidly interpreted at the breweries that in some instances an electrician was required to turn on a light. &quot;In summer, on Sundays, we had to have an electrician come in to turn on the lights so a laborer could hose down the kegs to prevent the wood drying out and springing leaks,&quot; Mr. Gilbert recalls. But in fact, wooden kegs had been replaced by metal casks a decade earlier.    Another brewery tradition was that if a wooden keg sprang a leak the workers were allowed to consume its contents. When metal casks were introduced the workers insisted that some kegs be designated &quot;leakers&quot; so they wouldn't forgo any free beer.    Mr. Gilbert says his efforts to negotiate change were fruitless. After a series of strikes the company cut staff by more than 75% and automated the plant. &quot;Management was prepared to pay a super premium to get rid of labor,&quot; he says. But disrupted production helped weaken the company, which was taken over in 1983.    Changing longstanding work practices doesn't have to end in strikes and firings. Kodak (Australasia) Pty., a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak Co., negotiated major changes at its plant and regional laboratories without any big fights.    To lower production costs, the company wanted to introduce a 24-hour operation. Many staff initially objected to the thought of working nights, some citing 25-year-old employment forms which specified that they would only be required to work during the day. Compared with its nonunionized U.S. parent, Kodak in Australia faced negotiations with 20 unions, and the change could have meant industrial turmoil.    Instead, Kodak outlined its production goals and asked employees to suggest ways to meet them. After six months of discussion, workers supported the idea of two 12-hour shifts at the plant. In exchange for some night work and longer hours, the staff got a three-day workweek.    &quot;They wanted to design their own rosters,&quot; says Graeme Hitchell, the company's employee-relations manager. &quot;When I first saw them I thought they looked complicated and atrocious, but they've been working and working well.&quot;    He says the company was prepared to face the fact that changes take longer through consultation. &quot;The gain is a work climate that isn't a constant battle.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
