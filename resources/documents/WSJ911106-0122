The LA police chief offered500 officers to guard the players, but the Banning teampreferred to ruin its 7-0 record rather than risk a repeat ofshootouts at its games.   ACLU World: The Supreme Court today hears the ACLU's claimthat the problem with public schools is that there is toomuch religion.</LP><TEXT>   The justices live in their own confused world. They starttheir daily sessions with the prayer, &quot;God save the UnitedStates and this honorable court,&quot; but lower courts interprettheir precedents as banning students from hearing &quot;Amen&quot;during a graduation ceremony. Whatever ethical signalsstudents receive from condom distributions or needleexchanges, judges now rule that the G word is too dangerousto be mentioned in public school.   Today's case, Lee v. Weisman, is the culmination of acareful litigation strategy that conservative lawyers and theBush administration hope will turn the legal tide away fromACLU fundamentalism. The case began when a public junior highschool in Providence invited Rabbi Leslie Gutterman todeliver the invocation and benediction at its 1989graduation. The school gave the rabbi a pamphlet entitled&quot;Guidelines for Civic Occasions,&quot; published by the NationalConference of Christians and Jews, and requested carefullynon-sectarian prayers.   Rabbi Gutterman's prayers were more about patriotism andreligious tolerance than fire and brimstone. The invocationbegan, &quot;God of the Free, Hope of the Brave: For the legacy ofAmerica where diversity is celebrated and the rights ofminorities are protected, we thank You.&quot; Perhaps anticipatingthis lawsuit, the rabbi also referred to the blessing of thiscountry's &quot;court system where all can seek justice.&quot;   Student Deborah Weisman and her parents objected to thisprayer (ironically, it's stipulated in the case that they areJewish). ACLU lawyers added this case to their stack ofboiler-plate anti-prayer lawsuits in the federal courts. Itwas a matter of routine when lower-court federal judgesapplied Supreme Court precedents to say that the invocationshould not have occurred and must not be repeated.   Both sides in the case agree that the judges were right toinvalidate Rabbi Gutterman's prayer if the test the SupremeCourt created in 1971 is still good law. Lemon v. Kurtzmanset out a standard for permissible government religiouspractices that manages to be both rigid and vague. Thepractice must have a secular purpose, neither advance norinhibit religion as the &quot;principal primary effect&quot; and mustnot create an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; between government andreligion.   Close students of activist judges know to reach for theirpockets when they see such three-prong tests. These aredesigned to let judges arbitrarily rule on a case-by-casebasis, even if what the Constitution actually says is clear.Here is all the First Amendment says on the subject:&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment ofreligion.&quot; The purpose of the Establishment Clause is toprohibit the establishment of a national religion. The ideawas that we would not have any national religion, noequivalent to the Church of England.   Charles Cooper, a former Reagan Justice Departmentofficial who will urge the justices to allow suchbenedictions, says in court papers that the Supreme Court hadthe law about right until 30 years ago. This was when liberaljustices began erecting walls against the mere mention ofreligion. Before then, the question was not whether someonediscussed religion, even prayed, but whether there was anygovernment coercion.   &quot;It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are 20gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks myleg,&quot; Thomas Jefferson wrote. In other words, religious testsfor public office and laws requiring sabbath observance canbreak my bones, but religious words can never hurt me.   Certainly the Founders approved official references to thedeity. After all, Who did they say endowed everyone with&quot;certain inalienable rights&quot;? On the same day the firstCongress voted to adopt the Establishment Clause, the Housepassed a resolution asking President Washington to proclaiman annual &quot;day of public thanksgiving and prayer . . .acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favorsof Almighty God.&quot;   The logical extension of the ACLU view is that it wasunconstitutional for Martin Luther King Jr. to give his &quot;IHave a Dream&quot; speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial;his offense was saying, &quot;Thank God Almighty, we are free atlast.&quot; The national motto, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; would have tobe torn from bills and rubbed off coins. Don't even ask aboutthe Pledge of Allegiance.   Several justices have criticized the &quot;Lemon&quot; test. Thecourt could instead concentrate on preventing governmentcoercion. If so, references to religion would be allowed atvoluntary sessions such as school graduations. Creches andmenorahs could return to public land without the minimumquota of secular Frosty the Snowmen that recent cases demand.   The justices could decide to approve the invocation herewithout also allowing other school prayers. Solicitor GeneralKenneth Starr filed a friend-of-the-court brief agreeing withMr. Cooper that graduation invocations are different fromdaily prayers. &quot;Subtle coercion may be present in theclassroom setting,&quot; Mr. Starr wrote. True, but if words alonedon't always amount to coercion maybe there can also besufficiently non-denominational, non-coercive prayers inpublic school.   A continued policy of zero tolerance for religion inpublic schools will not abolish religion, but it might speedthe end of public schools. If these schools cannot toleratereligion, many parents will have another reason to get theirchildren out. Indeed, call this case the Justices Meet SchoolChoice.   The best way to end the bitter dispute over school prayeris to adopt material school-choice programs where parentscould choose among schools that compete partly on whetherthey allow prayers. Some parents would prefer schools withprayers, others might want schools without prayers. Forschools that allowed prayers, there would be no danger ofcoercion because the students selected the schoolsvoluntarily.   The ACLU would then no doubt complain that taxpayersshould not finance schools that allow prayers, but thejustices would know better than to accept this argument. TheMarshal of the Supreme Court who issues their daily prayer isa government employee.</TEXT></DOC>
