Filings in the government's price-fixing case against NelsonBunker and William Herbert Hunt show that government investigatorsbelieve they were close to establishing a world silver monopoly in1980.   The brothers, in their response, say the silver shopping spreewas nothing out of the ordinary for the sons of legendary Texasoilman H.L. Hunt.   The government and defense documents, which had been under courtseal, were obtained by The Associated Press this week through aFreedom of Information Act request.   ``H.L. Hunt was a wildcatter,'' the brothers' lawyers say intheir response. ``He raised his sons with a wildcatter'sphilosophy, which involved risk-taking and rapid decision making.When the Hunts enter a field of investment, they typically do so ona relatively large scale in light of their substantial wealth.''   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission contends that thebrothers actually were engaged in a price-fixing scheme.   In a previously sealed submission by the CFTC to anadministrative law judge, the agency contends that had the schemenot collapsed, ``by the end of May 1980, they could have ownedvirtually the entire available world supply of deliverable .999silver bullion.''   Attorneys for the Hunts counter that their silver investmentsstemmed simply from their preference for investing in hard assetsas a hedge against inflation and monetary uncertainty.   And they said such large purchases were in keeping with thebrothers' approach to business.   At the time of the 1987 filing, Hunt attorneys said, Bunkerowned a forest in Florida, the largest tract of land in northernAustralia, a quarter of million square feet of building property indowntown Anchorage and the biggest piece of waterfront property inSan Diego. He was one of the largest cattle raisers in the country,and owned the largest Arab coin collection in the world.   Their oil holdings ``of course, are very substantial,'' thelawyers said, and include interests in ``many of the richest fieldsdiscovered to date.''   Many documents in the case had been sealed from the public viewsince 1985 at the Hunts' request; the stack is now more than 5 feettall. The filings in the quasi-judicial proceeding were released bythe agency this week in response to the AP request.   The CFTC has accused the brothers, heirs to one of the world'sgreatest fortunes, of rigging the price of silver futures betweenfall 1979 and March 27, 1980. That day came to be known as ``SilverThursday'' as prices crashed to $10 an ounce from a one-time highof more than $50 an ounce.   Thousands of investors, who had purchased silver on credit, lostbillions of dollars when they were forced to sell it to pay theirdebts. The Hunts themselves lost an estimated $1.3 billion.   ``The prices for silver bullion and futures during that periodrose to their highest levels of the century and then fell even morequickly than they had risen. Only the (Hunts') silver-buying frenzy... accounts for the magnitude of the price rise,'' said a CFTCdocument.   It is the largest market manipulation case ever filed by theCFTC and if the Hunts lose, they could be permanently banned fromtrading in all futures markets and fined $100,000 for eachviolation of federal commodity laws.   The brothers' response to the charges offers a glimpse intojet-setting life on the international horse-racing circuit fromKentucky to France, of banking in Zurich, and of courting Arabinvestors.   The CFTC says it has evidence of a ``tangled web'' ofrelationships and rendezvous at luxurious locales to supportcharges the men schemed to corner the silver market. The agencyalleges the Hunts recruited Saudi Arabian sheiks Ali Bin Mussalamand Mohammed Aboud Al-Amoudi, and Brazilian speculator Naji RobertNahas to join their effort.   ``These horse-related meetings amount to zero proof ofconspiracy or manipulative intent,'' the Hunts responded. ``Thereis not a scrap of evidence that these meetings resulted in anyjoint conduct _ or even parallel transactions _ with respect tosilver.''   Since the 1987 filing, the brothers have filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy reorganization. They face several Internal RevenueService claims totaling many millions of dollars, and Bunker Huntwas forced to sell his beloved breeding and racing stock of horsesbecause of setbacks in the oil industry.   They and others also have been ordered by a jury in New York topay $136.4 million to Minpeco S.A., the Peruvian government'ssilver mining company, for ruined investments because of the silverprice collapse.</TEXT></DOC>
