Microsoft has not revealed many of its arguments.andO;The company claimed successfully that its court documents contain tradesecrets and has filed nearly all of them under protective seal.andM;In one unsealed document, however, Microsoft admitted the original licensewas limited to the current version of Windows and programs that look likeWindows 1.0.andM;However, Microsoft rejected this draft of the contract and prepared anotherdraft that allowed the use of the licensed visual displays in ''any futureMicrosoft programs.''andM;The new draft of the contract also contained no look-and-feel restrictions,and allowed Microsoft to sublicense the visual displays.andM;''If Microsoft can show there were negotiations over the contract, andearlier points were negotiated out, then I would say Microsoft has a verystrong argument,'' said G. Gervaise Davis III, a computer-law expert withSchroeder, Davis andamp; Orliss, a law firm with offices in Monterey and San Jose,Calif.andM;Apple's attorneys claim Microsoft's Windows 2.03 is an unauthorizedderivative of Apple's copyrighted audiovisual works, and that it goes aboveand beyond Microsoft's 1985 license agreement with Apple.andM;In arguing the copyright infringement, Apple's attorneys maintain that,because Windows 2.03 uses overlapping windows in its standard configurationwhereas Windows 1.0 used tiled windows, version 2.03 looks more like theMacintosh interface.andM;As a result, the attorneys claimed, it violates the agreement and Apple'scopyrights.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
