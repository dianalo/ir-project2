This final ruleis published in exercise of rulemaking authority delegated by the Secretaryof the Interior to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs by 209 DM 8.The BIA published a proposed rule on November 6, 1987 (52 FR 43006), offeringthe public an apportunity to comment on appeals from administrative actions.This rule does not contain collections of information which require theapproval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.The final rule is published as previously titled, Appeals from AdministrativeActions. This revision eliminates Central Office action on many of theappeals which originate in the field. Most appeals will be sent directlyto the Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) from the field.Comments were received from sixteen sources including Indian tribes, tribalattorneys, government solicitors and Bureau officials. The following para-graphs summarize the comments and suggestions received and actions taken.<T3>Section 2.2: </T3>One commenter suggested that the definition of ``appeal''in proposed andSection; 2.2 be amended to include the words ``or the inaction''after the word ``action''. This change has been made to reflect the intentof the regulation that either an action or an inaction may be subject toappeal. The words ``is in error'' have been added to the definition of``statement of reasons'' as recommended by another commenter.<T3>Section 2.3 </T3>One commenter recommended that in andSection; 2.3(a)the words ``may be'' replace ``are or will be'' to clarify that appellantsdo not have to prove that they are adversely affected, only to allege it.This comment is accepted.One commenter noted that, under the National Environmental Policy Act,environmental matters may be appealed to the Federal courts without firstgoing through the Bureau appeals process. Subsection 2.3(b) makes the appealprocedures in Part 2 inapplicable where another regulation or a Federalstatute provides a different procedure. Therefore, no change is necessary.<T3>Section 2.4:</T3> A new andSection; 2.4(d) has been added providing thata Deputy to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs may issue a decisionin an appeal if that responsibility has been assigned to him/her by theAssistant Secretary_Indian Affairs pursuant to andSection; 2.20(c). See thediscussion under andSection; 2.20. <T3>Section 2.4(e)</T3> (proposed andSection; 2.4(d)) has been revised toprovide that the Interior Board of Indian Appeals will hear appeals fromdecisions of a Deputy to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs made pursuantto an assignment of responsibility under andSection; 2.20(c). This subsectionhas been further revised to delete the authority of the Board to hear appealsfrom decisions of the Deputy to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs/Director(Indian Education Programs). Appeals from decisions of this official willbe made to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs for the reasons discussedunder andSection; 2.20(g). <T3>Section 2.5:</T3> Six comments were received on this section. Threecommenters were concerned that indigent appellants might not be able topost an appeal bond if required to do so. Two commenters were concernedthat collateral proceedings would delay proceedings in the appeal. Onesuggested that an interlocutory appeal procedure be set out. After thoroughconsideration of these comments, it has been decided that the bond provisionis necessary for the protection of Indians and should be retained. TheBureau and the Interior Board of Indian Appeals have had bond provisionsin their appeal regulations since 1960 and 1975, respectively. These provisionshave been implemented without undue hardship to appellants. A new andSection; 2.5(c) has been added to make clear that the deciding officialmust give notice when he/she issues a decision requiring a bond or denyinga request that a bond be required. Although no specific interlocutory appealprovisions are included in andSection; 2.5, aggrieved parties may appealfrom these decisions. <T3>Section 2.6:</T3> One commenter believed that proposed andSection; 2.6(a),which stated that a decision of the Assistant Secretary is final for theDepartment and effective immediately unless the Assistant Secretary providesotherwise, did not clearly indicate how the Assistant Secretary would provideotherwise. This subsection, now andSection; 2.6(c), has been revised to statethat such a provision must appear in the decision itself. A new provision at andSection; 2.6(b) clarifies that a decision made by aBIA official becomes final when the time for filing a notice of appealhas expired and no notice of appeal has been filed. <T3>Section 2.7:</T3> Two commenters noted that the term ``effective notice''in proposed andSection; 2.7(b) was not defined. Section 2.7(b) has been rewordedto state that time to file an appeal does not begin to run until noticehas been given in accordance with andSection; 2.7(c), which sets out theinformation concerning appeal procedures which must be contained in thenotice of a decision. Two commenters objected to the wording of proposed andSection; 2.7(c) becauseit did not clearly identify which decisions were appealable and which werenot. Two commenters suggested that the subsection be revised to identifymore specifically the information regarding appeal procedures which isrequired to be included in BIA decisions. The subsection has been rewordedto make clear that only decisions which are final for the Department pursuantto andSection; 2.6(c) are not administratively appealable and to state morespecifically the appeal information to be included in decisions. <T3>Section 2.8:</T3> The comments generally favored this provision, whichsets out a procedure for appealing from inaction of a BIA official. Threecommenters recommended that a time limit be set for the ``reasonable laterdate'' for making a decision which andSection; 2.8(b) requires a BIA officialto establish. andSection; 2.8(b) has been revised to provide that the datemust be no later than 60 days from the date of the request for a decision.Proposed andSection;andSection; 2.8 (a)(3) and (b), 2.9(a), and 2.19(a) includednew provisions for student appeals pertaining to expulsions and suspensions.These have been deleted from the final rule in order to preserve the statusquo of regulations concerning Indian education, as required by andSection;5106 of the Indian Education Amendments of 1988, 102 Stat. 367.<T3>Section 2.9:</T3> Four commenters recommended that the time for anappellant to file a notice of appeal should begin to be counted from thedate that the appellant received the notice of administrative action ratherthan the date that it was mailed. Also, four comments on this section andandSection; 2.13 recommended that appeal documents submitted by the appellantshould be considered filed when they were mailed, rather than when theywere received by the decisionmaker. Section 2.9(a), and corresponding provisionsthroughout the regulation, have been revised to incorporate each recommendationin its entirety.One commenter objected to the omission from the proposed regulations ofthe present requirement that BIA officials render assistance to appellantIndians and Indian tribes not represented by counsel. This provision hasbeen reinstated in a new andSection; 2.9(b).Section 2.9(c)(5), andSection; 2.10 (a) and (b), and andSection; 2.11(b) havebeen reworded and expanded to clarify the original intent as suggestedby several comments received.One commenter objected to the requirement for labeling of envelopes inandSection; 2.9(c)(3), andSection; 2.10(d)(2) and andSection; 2.11(e)(2) as beingsuperfluous. Appeal documents are not always self-evident. The purposeof identifying the contents on the envelope is to speed processing. Failureto include this on the envelope, however, is not grounds for summary dismissal.<T3>Section 2.10:</T3> One commenter stated that failure to conform tothe formal requirements for a statement of reasons described in this sectionshould not be grounds for summary dismissal under andSection; 2.17. The revisionof andSection; 2.17 discussed below responds to this comment.<T3>Section 2.13:</T3> One commenter questioned whether andSection; 2.13(c),concerning misdirected appeal documents, included notices of appeal. Thissubsection has been revised to make clear that a BIA official will allowlate filing of a misdirected notice of appeal where the official determinesthat the misdirection is the fault of the government.Other revisions to andSection; 2.13 are discussed under andSection; 2.9.<T3>Section 2.17:</T3> One commenter recommended adding failure to filea timely notice of appeal to the grounds for summary dismissal. This sectionhas been revised to incorporate the provision, also set out in andSection;2.9(a), which requires the dismissal of an appeal when the notice of appealis not timely filed.Two commenters recommended revisions concerning the provision in proposedandSection; 2.17 that permitted summary dismissal for failure to file a statementof reasons. In response to these comments, this section has been revisedto allow summary dismissal only where the reasons for the appeal cannotbe determined from the appeal documents taken as a whole and only afterthe appellant has been given an opportunity to amend his/her appeal documents.<T3>Section 2.19:</T3> Two commenters suggested that andSection; 2.19(a)be revised to identify more specifically the information regarding appealsprocedures, in particular the 30-day time limit for filing a notice ofappeal, required to be included in decisions by BIA officials. This sectionhas been revised to incorporate these suggestions.One commenter recommended that a specific provision be included allowingappeal to the next level when a BIA official fails to issue a decisionwithin the time allowed. When an appeal level is skipped, the administrativerecord may not be properly developed, making effective consideration ofthe appeal at a higher level difficult. Further, the opportunity to resolvethe appeal at the lower level is foregone. For these reasons, this commentis not accepted. BIA officials are expected to issue decisions in accordancewith the time deadlines in these regulations.<T3>Section 2.20:</T3> Three commenters either objected to the inclusionof the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs in the appeal process or recommendedthat the Assistant Secretary's decisions be subject to review by the InteriorBoard of Indian Appeals (IBIA). One commenter recommended that appellantsbe allowed to choose whether to appeal to the Assistant Secretary or theIBIA. Another suggested that some appellants might seek to have the AssistantSecretary assume jurisdiction over their appeals by filing petitions withthat official.The comments recommending exclusion of the Assistant Secretary from theappeal process or making his/her decisions subject to review by the IBIAare not accepted. Certain appeals involve policy matters requiring theattention of the Assistant Secretary. Further, the IBIA does not have jurisdictionto review discretionary decisions of BIA officials. (See the discussionof 43 CFR Part 4 Subpart D, immediately following.) In order to make clearthat this section is not intended to give the parties to an appeal a choiceof forum, but rather is intended to vest the exclusive authority to assumejurisdiction over an appeal in the Assistant Secretary, a sentence hasbeen added to andSection; 2.20(c) stating, ``The Assistant Secretary_IndianAffairs will not consider petitions to exercise this authority.''Section 2.20(c) has been further revised to authorize the Assistant Secretary_IndianAffairs to assign the responsibility to issue a decision in an appeal toa Deputy to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs. A decision made bya Deputy to the Assistant Secretary pursuant to such an assignment maybe appealed to the Board of Indian Appeals except as provided for in andSection;2.20(g).One commenter recommended clarification of the extent to which the IBIAcould review BIA decisions that it receives pursuant to andSection; 2.20(e).In response to this recommendation, andSection; 2.20(e) has been revisedto make clear that IBIA jurisdiction over appeals received pursuant tothis subsection are subject to 43 CFR 4.337(b), as are other appeals fromBIA decisions.A new andSection; 2.20(g) has been added providing for decisions by the AssistantSecretary_Indian Affairs in appeals from decisions of the Deputy to theAssistant Secretary_Indian Affairs/Director (Indian Education Programs).The proposed rule provided that appeals from this official would be madeto the Interior Board of Indian Appeals. The change has been made to preservethe status quo of existing appeal procedures for education appeals, asrequired by andSection; 5106 of the Indian Education Amendments of 1988,102 Stat. 367. Section 2.21: Three commenters recommended revision of andSection; 2.21(b)to allow the parties to an appeal to obtain copies of documents consideredby the decisionmaker but not included in the administrative record andto provide a specific time for response by the parties. The subsectionhas been revised to incorporate these recommendations. One commenter requested a 30 day period for reconsideration by the initialdecisionmaker. The decisionmaker under these proposed regulations wouldalready have an opportunity to reverse the initial decision at the timethe notice of appeal is filed with him/her before forwarding the appealinformation to the next highest appeal level. Consequently, it was feltthat adoption of this process would only serve to lengthen the total process.The comment is therefore not accepted.

This rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment and no detailed statement is requiredpursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Departmentof the Interior has determined that this document is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 and certifies this document will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These regulations will affect only administrative appealsfrom decisions by certain BIA officials. The final rule governing appeals to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals,43 CFR 4.310-4.340, immediately follows this rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 25 CFR Part 2 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure.
