The results of the different configurations arepresented. The ASM probe is quite accurate and its performance is wellunderstood in those situations where we have a relatively large areathat has 1-D flow. Area is expensive and it is desirable to make measurementsusing a minimum of this resource. When we confine ourselves to a smallarea we get electromagnetic effects and perturbations in the hydrodynamicflows that were absent in experiments whose lateral extent was largeenough to effectively eliminate these problems. We are forced towardmagnet and coil configurations that are not ideal for best accuracy.In the experiment described in this report, we describe and report theresults of six ASM probes that approach the goal of using less area.2 refs., 23 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
