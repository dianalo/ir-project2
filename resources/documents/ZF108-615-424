 You've just assumed the couch potato position.andP;  Your plan is towatch the late night TV movie until you nod off or run out of popcorn.andP;  Butbefore either can happen, a smiling face appears on the screen.andP;  It looks alot like IBM chairman and chief executive officer John Akers.andM;Before you can hit the mute button on the remote control, Akers says, &quot;Hi,friends.andP;  Looking for some good, reliable processing power but can't swingthe financing on a new $7 million 3090-200J?andP;  Well, have we got a solutionfor you!&quot;andM;You notice that the smiling man is seated next to a 3090-400E mainframe.andP;  Heis making intense eye contact through the camera as he continues, &quot;Why notbuy or lease a clean, preowned enterprise system like this beauty?andP;  Only acouple of years old and still computes like new.andP;  So bring your old machine,the slip and your data center manager down to our near-the-freeway location,and make us an offer.andP;  We're IBM, and we are the dealingest.&quot;andM;Such a scene isn't so difficult to imagine.andP;  After years of maintaining anarms-length relationship with the used mainframe market, IBM now seems to bejumping right in.andP;  Users, leasing companies and hardware competitors all saythat IBM sales reps increasingly offer used 3090 mainframes to customershesitating over even heavily discounted new IBM gear in favor ofplug-compatible or leasing company alternatives.andM;Beleaguered leasing companies say IBM has needlessly targeted them in amisguided bid for increased account control.andP;  But users aren't complaining.andO;They are enjoying unprecedented alternatives in used equipment and lowerprices.andM;&quot;IBM's become much more aggressive,&quot; says Al Elstien, vice president forinformation services at Acco World, in Wheeling, Ill.andP;  Acco is the officesupplies subsidiary of American Brands Inc. of Old Greenwich, Conn.andP;  &quot;Notonly are they discounting new equipment but they're willing to sell usedequipment that's been returned to them from lease.andP;  It's definitely somethingwe like to see,&quot; says Elstien, who is considering upgrading his data center's3090-150E with a used 200E or 200S.andM;IBM has also been actively remarketing mainframes to government accounts,many of which are just beginning to consider buying used equipment.andP;  The U.S.andO;Marine Corps, for example, is currently looking at IBM's bid of 15 usedmainframes.andM;Divided They FallandM;Computer Language Research Inc. a commercial income tax processing serviceprovider in Carrollton, Texas, recently evaluated IBM's bid of a used3090-300E mainframe.andP;  Although the company opted for a leasing competitor'sused mainframe instead, IS chief Richard Weincek says he was surprised to seeIBM sales reps aggressively bidding used equipment.andP;  &quot;They seem to be willingto negotiate and to discuss things they never would before,&quot; says Weincek.andO;&quot;Users can really come out ahead right now if you can get IBM and the leasingguys fighting between themselves.&quot;andM;Indeed, inciting infighting between computer vendors appears an easy task.andO;Leasing companies complain that Big Blue has reneged on long-standingpromises.andP;  Some say the company's move into the used equipment market will bethe straw that finally breaks many leasing company backs, driving them out ofthe IBM market--or out of business altogether.andP;  In the long run, they say,IBM's presence will reduce user alternatives.andP;  &quot;Only the very strong willsurvive,&quot; predicts Bob Bardagy, executive vice president for marketing atRosemont, Ill.-based Comdisco Inc.andM;Historically, IBM has left mainframe remarketing to leasing companies andsystems refurbishers, preferring to focus on selling higher margin new gear.andO;IBM ended up owning some used systems as a result of customer upgrades orterminated rental agreements.andP;  These it broke down for spare parts or soldoff to leasing companies for remarketing.andP;  In those days, lessors made ahealthy business, trafficking in used IBM gear.andP;  About a third of the $250million in revenue generated last year by lessor El Camino Resources Ltd. ofNorthridge, Calif., came from remarketing.andP;  Comdisco's remarketing activitypulled in $268 million last year, up from $250 million in 1988.andM;The leasing equation began to change about a year ago when IBM started itsremarketing venture, and it's still changing now.andP;  &quot;There's been a majorshift in the way our industry works,&quot; says Dave Wolff, executive vicepresident for El Camino Resources.andP;  &quot;IBM gave us an open door for the lastfew years.andP;  But now they want back in.andP;  They've invaded another piece of theindependents' marketplace.&quot;andM;Where Credit Is DueandM;Users and leasing executives cite two key factors in IBM's strategy shift.andO;First is the company's expanded role, through IBM Credit Corp. (ICC), incomputer lease financing.andP;  Second is its desire to retain control of--or atleast a presence in--as many mainframe accounts as possible in preparationfor next year's anticipated shipments of Summit, the company's new high-endsystem.andM;IBM created its Credit Corp. in 1981 and between 1985 and 1989 increased thevalue of equipment under ICC capital and operating leases by 164% to a totalof $6.58 billion.andP;  Some leasing experts estimate that the subsidiary nowfinances between 60 and 70% of all IBM mainframes leased by users, or about35% of all IBM mainframes going into service.andP;  Others estimate that IBMcurrently owns upward of 3,000 3090 mainframes operating under lease at usersites.andM;The question for IBM has become what to do with all of these used mainframesas the leases expire or their owners trade up.andP;  Between 1986 and 1987, ICCwrote an increasing number of three-year capital equipment leases.andP;  Thoseleases are now expiring, as are many shorter-term operating leases that ICCwrote in the last year.andP;  Needless to say, Big Blue has a flood of usedequipment on its hands.andP;  &quot;There's a lot of stuff coming off leases, and it'sonly going to increase over the next year or so,&quot; says Thomas J. Donovan,director of investment strategies for Technology Investment Strategies Inc.,andO;a subsidiary of International Data Group.andM;The motivation for IBM to cut out the middlemen and remarket used systemsitself is strong.andP;  Because many used computers come back before their leaseshave covered the original value, the company needs to squeeze additionalrevenue out of them.andP;  For the last few years, ICC has lured customers withcontracts that leave IBM holding significant residual value.andP;  For example,competitors say that ICC is currently writing leases on new 3390 disk driveswith residual values equivalent to 35% of the equipment's original value.andO;That's almost double the residuals independents are willing to leave in theirdeals.andM;&quot;We've seen an overzealous ICC taking larger and larger residual positionsover the last few year, and now ICC management doesn't want to have to writeoff all of those residuals.andP;  So they're reselling the used boxes,&quot; saysHarvey Kinzelberg, chairman of The Meridian Group in Deerfield, Ill.andM;Other factors appear to be pushing IBM toward remarketing, as well.andP;  Lastyear, the company adjusted its sales rep compensation schedule to focus ontotal revenue rather than product specific points, which makes selling usedequipment more worthwhile for IBM reps.andP;  The company has also increased thesize of its sales force significantly, and selling used gear can helpleverage the investment.andM;Slip Sliding AwayandM;Regardless of IBM's reasons for selling used equipment, many users say BigBlue's strategy fits perfectly with their own.andP;  They believe that Summit isjust around the corner and see little difference between the four models ofthe 3090 mainframe line.andP;  Consequently, many are willing to remain oneupgrade behind and buy or lease used equipment.andM;&quot;I can bet big or bet little, and I'd rather bet little at this time,&quot; saysStephen I. Pook, Iselin-based IS director of specialty metals manufacturerEngelhard Corp. in Edison, N.J.andP;  Engelhard replaced its new 3090-180Jmainframe with a used 3090-300E rather than upgrade to a new machine.andM;Jim Miller, IS vice president at James River Corp. in Richmond, Va., callshis strategy Slip Stream.andP;  &quot;As long as I'm not in a position where mycustomers are demanding that I keep up with the latest technicalcapabilities, I'm willing to stay just far enough behind the leading edge toenjoy some real economic benefits.&quot;andP;  Miller says he devised the strategy in1983, when he installed a used 3084 mainframe instead of a then-new 3090-200in the company's new data center.andP;  Using used equipment saved James River 50%of the cost of the 3090.andM;However, users pay a price for buying used gear: they are unable to takeimmediate advantage of the latest in mainframe innovations.andP;  For example,someone buying a used 3090-400E will not be able to use the Hiperbatchfeature in IBM's new MVS/ESA operating environment.andP;  But that's acceptable tosome users.andP;  &quot;If you're an airline or a bank, maybe you need it,&quot; saysMiller.andP;  &quot;But there's a big market out there of people who can get by withused equipment.&quot;andM;Many welcome IBM's remarketing push with open arms.andP;  More competition meanslessors are less likely to play hardball when it comes time to upgrade orrenegotiate a lease.andP;  &quot;In my past experience, if you dealt with a leasingcompany, and they knew they had you at a disadvantage, they could be verytough.andP;  It was strictly supply and demand,&quot; says Acco World's Elstien.andP;  &quot;It'sgood to have another major player in the market.&quot;andM;Obviously, IBM's competitors in the used market disagree.andP;  While some leasingexecutives admit IBM's entry into remarketing makes used equipment morewidely acceptable, others say IBM's practices have confused users.andM;Some lessors say IBM's participation in the market has driven used equipmentprices down abnormally fast, taking the profit out of remarketing.andP;  Prices ofmany 3090 base and E systems have fallen precipitously in recent months, forexample, according to officials at Computer Intelligence of La Jolla, Calif.andM;If You Can't Stand the HeatandM;The 350-member Computer Dealers and Lessors Association Inc. (CDLA), based inWashington, D.C., has asked IBM to explain why it is breaking itslongstanding practice of staying away from used equipment.andP;  According to CDLAexecutive director Greg Carroll, &quot;Over the years, we had been assured by IBMthat the majority of equipment coming back would be remarketed through thesecondary market....andP;  We're just finding that that's not really the caseanymore.&quot;andM;Carroll says that IBM industry relations executives insist the company stillallows independent leasing companies to resell most of its used equipment.andO;IBM says it will remarket equipment directly to end users only when facingstiff competition from plug-compatible manufacturer (PCM) vendors.andM;But Carroll and many CDLA members are skeptical.andP;  Although Carroll admits hecan't prove IBM now remarkets most of its used equipment directly, he saysit's clear something has changed.andP;  In many cases, there's no real competitionother than a leasing company who would be bidding on the financing,&quot; Carrollsays.andP;  &quot;But IBM responds by bidding used gear.andP;  The whole premise behind itis really account control.&quot;andM;One aspect of the dispute has already ended up in court.andP;  The CDLA accusedIBM of attempting to stifle the leasing and refurbishing companies byrestricting their ability to make microcode changes in IBM equipment.andP;  Thelegal battle grew out of a suit between IBM and Allen-Myland Inc., aBroomall, Pa., computer refurbisher that acquires used IBM multiprocessormainframes, breaks them apart and resells them as used uniprocessors--apractice that requires microcode changes.andP;  IBM now insists its microcode isprotected by copyright and can't be changed.andP;  CDLA is supporting Allen-Mylandin the suit, which, at press time, had progressed to a jury trial.andM;Citing the pending litigation, IBM officials declined to discuss changes intheir remarketing strategy.andP;  However, ICC's 1989 annual report notes thatlast year the subsidiary &quot;formalized a program&quot; to provide used equipment tosome customers.andP;  The report adds, &quot;As our portfolio of leased equipmentexpands, we expect our program to grow, as well.&quot;andM;If it does, independent leasing companies will retreat from the IBM market,which will reduce competition and cut options for users of new and used IBMgear.andP;  &quot;A lot of people in our business are saying, 'Why should I continue todeal in this IBM marketplace?andP;  There are a lot of other good products outthere,'&quot; says CDLA's Carroll.andM;A 1989 survey of CDLA members shows that a shift is already occurring.andO;Whereas IBM gear accounted for 82% of CDLA member leasing and trading volumein 1987, the figure dropped to 74% in 1988 and was projected to slip to 71%last year.andP;  To pick up the slack, lessors such as Comdisco are turning toalternative vendors such as Amdahl and Digital Equipment Corp. and to othertypes of equipment such as digital private branch exchanges (PBXs) for morebusiness.andM;That could spell long-term trouble for IBM customers, as vendors get lesscompetitive.andP;  In the short term, a growing number of users are cashing in.andO;If they're in the market for a used computer and they're talking to IBM, &quot;Noreasonable offer will be refused,&quot; as they say down on auto row.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
