The companies wouldn't disclose the price, but London analysts speculated it would be as little as #10 million, or about $16 million.    London-based Glaxo's planned purchase of the small biotechnology pioneer's Geneva-based lab represents its entry in the world-wide race to find genetically engineered medicines for cancer and AIDS.    News of the Glaxo transaction, to be completed in about a month, sent the company's stock soaring. Its market value gained more than #300 million, as the stock price rose 41 pence to #17.90 a share in late trading yesterday on the London Stock Exchange. In national over-the-counter trading, Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen's stock rose 37.5 cents to $10.875.    Biogen, which had a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $7.7 million on revenue of $1.8 million, had been trying to sell the lab for nine months. It said the lab's operating costs are currently $12 million a year, and the sale will slash its expenses. The sale will reduce Biogen's 228-member scientific staff by about one-third, but Biogen Chairman James Vincent denied the cut would hurt Biogen's edge in research.    The purchase will save Glaxo three to four years in building its own genetic-engineering operations. Glaxo plans to invest further in the lab and rename it the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology.    The proposed sale also includes marketing rights for two potential cancer and AIDS medicines under development at the lab. But analysts noted that clinical trials of the drugs will take another few years, and several other big drug companies also are testing competing versions. </TEXT></DOC>
