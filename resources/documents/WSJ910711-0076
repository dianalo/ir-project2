Expanding the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System topsthe agenda this year. The Wild and Scenic system, created 23years ago, now includes sections of 124 rivers, but stillprotects only about 0.3% of U.S. river miles. Oregon, Alaskaand California have the most rivers in the program. Proposalspushed by environmental groups for Arizona, Michigan andWashington could quickly double the size of the system. About100 river nominees await action by Congress.   At the federal level, fragmented water-resource policiesfrustrate conservationists. Eight U.S. departments and sevenindependent agencies share responsibility, often working atcross-purposes and seldom taking a comprehensive approach.Critics advocate sweeping reforms for the Bureau ofReclamation, which oversees about 600 dams and reservoirs,and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which licenseshydroelectric plants.   The Wilderness Society's George T. Frampton Jr. wantsPresident Bush to appoint a commission to fix the mess. Whileadministration officials say they're doing the best they can,Mr. Frampton denounces the president as unable to &quot;see beyondthe end of his fishing line.&quot;   Disappointed by the lack of federal accomplishments, suchgroups as Oregon Rivers Council, Idaho Rivers United andFriends of the Earth see greater promise in bolstering stateprograms and forging more regional pacts. Some praise theColumbia Basin initiatives that have spared 4,000 river milesfrom dams.   Many local conservationists also view restoration effortsas urgent. In New England and Western states, they seekremedies for imperiled fish runs. Others lobby for cleanup ofcontamination from toxics that seep into watersheds fromabandoned mines. In Colorado, the High Country CitizensAlliance opposes diverting water from the Gunnison Rivereastward across the Continental Divide to such Denver suburbsas Aurora, where much of the supply is devoted to the lawnsof vacant houses.                                                                                                          Environmental Terms   Catch On Very Slowly                                                                                                          GREEN LINGO still confuses a lot of people.   Recent surveys indicate that about a third of U.S.consumers don't know the meaning of biodegradable (able tobreak down naturally). Fewer than a fifth can define sourcereduction (cutting waste in the making and packaging ofproducts).   The telephone surveys were conducted for industry clientsby Environmental Research Associates, a unit of AmericanOpinion Research, Princeton, N.J. Pollsters interviewed 1,000adults picked at random in 50 states.   According to the study, about 60% of Americans aren'taware that environmental symbols are being used to identifyrecycled and recyclable products and packaging. Only 10% candescribe a single one, and the vast majority don't know whatany mean.   Nearly three-fourths of all consumers view the endproduct, trash, as the most harmful stage of a product'slife, while fewer than a third express concerns about rawmaterials and energy used in making the product.   &quot;After years of hearing recycling promoted as a way tosolve our environmental problems, consumers may bedisappointed when these problems don't go away,&quot; the reportwarns.                                                                                                          Unspecified Ingredients   In Pesticides Draw Fire                                                                                                          PESTICIDES are under attack again, this time for secretingredients.   New York's attorney general, Robert Abrams, complains thatfederal laws make it virtually impossible for consumers tofind out whether certain toxic ingredients are contained inthe pesticides they buy for homes and yards.   Pesticide labels typically list a few &quot;active&quot; ingredientswith long chemical names, followed by the phrase &quot;inertingredients&quot; and only a percentage figure. But chemicals usedas inerts, to preserve the active ingredients or to make themeasier to apply, &quot;include some of the most dangeroussubstances known,&quot; says Mr. Abrams. Some are suspectedcarcinogens. Several, including phenol, toluene,chlorobenzene and xylene, are linked to birth defects, liverand kidney damage, or nervous system disorders.   Under federal law, the Environmental Protection Agency isgenerally required to keep the identity of inert ingredientssecret if manufacturers request confidentiality. Mr. Abramscontends that this practice forces consumers to &quot;playblindman's bluff&quot; with pesticides they buy.   For example, 99.1% of S.C. Johnson's Raid Ant andamp; RoachKiller is inert ingredients. Chevron's Ortho Diazinon Dust is96% inerts. Mr. Abrams and his staff examined 85 commonpesticide products and found that three-fourths of themcontained more than 90% inerts.   When Mr. Abrams asked the manufacturers to identify theinert ingredients, 23 companies, including Johnson, Chevron,Monsanto, Ciba-Geigy and Hartz Mountain, gave inadequateresponses. Eight others, including Dow Chemical, FMC and O.M.Scott, ignored the request. The companies declined tocomment.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          PARTITIONS that divide office space into workstations andcubicles can impede ventilation and interfere with removal ofair pollutants, according to tests conducted by EnvironmentalHealth andamp; Engineering of Newton, Mass. . . . The EPA isfunding &quot;greenhouse-effect&quot; research to determine how muchmethane cows produce when they belch. And that's only thefront end of the study.</TEXT></DOC>
