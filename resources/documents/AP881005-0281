James Dahl was forced to appear before the grand jury in thelast few weeks under a compulsion order obtained by the ManhattanU.S. attorney's office, Dahl's lawyer Peter Fishbein told TheAssociated Press.   The Wall Street Journal characterized Dahl's appearance as abreakthrough for the government in its extensive probe into thebusiness affairs of Milken and Drexel, who are fighting Securitiesand Exchange Commission charges of securities fraud and could facepossible criminal indictments soon.   But it was unclear from the Journal account how Dahl'sappearance represented a breakthrough. The content of his remarksto the grand jury were not disclosed.   ``Dahl is not a cooperating witness,'' Fishbein said. ``He wascompelled to do that by a court order. If he didn't testify hewould have been put in jail.''   Fishbein said the order contained a provision for immunity fromprosecution, which is specified in the federal law for obtainingsuch orders. The attorney declined to comment on what Dahl may havetold the grand jury.   Officials at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office did notimmediately return telephone calls for comment. Their policy,however, is to refrain from commenting on grand jury matters.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm doesn't comment ongrand jury proceedings. But he said Drexel's lawyers had advisedthe firm that grants of limited immunity were not unusual in suchinvestigations.   Dahl, who is still employed by the firm, works in Drexel's WestCoast-based high-yield bond department, headed by Milken.   The Journal said Dahl was the first Drexel official to breakranks and cooperate with the government's inquiry since the SECfiled its civil charges against the firm and Milken Sept. 7,accusing them of insider trading, stock manipulation, defraudingclients and other violations.   Those charges, denied by the defendants, stem largely fromclaims by now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who turnedstate's evidence after paying a record $100 million fine to thegovernment two years ago for insider trading. Federal investigatorshave been working to substantiate Boesky's assertions with otherevidence but there are indications they have been frustrated inobtaining supporting testimony from others.   Lawyers for Drexel and Milken, meantime, have been fightingaggressively to obtain whatever evidence the government has toprepare their defense. They also have challenged the objectivity ofthe federal judge assigned to the case, Milton Pollack, on groundshis wife has an interest in a Drexel-financed deal.   In a related matter, another federal judge ruled the governmenthas the right to freeze funds of innocent partners in an unindictedinvestment partnership, when other partners are accused in aracketeering case.   The Tuesday decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Carter issignificant because the case involving Princeton-Newport partners,a small partnership based in Princeton, N.J., represents the firsttime the government has brought racketeering charges againstsecurities professionals.   Carter's ruling apparently gives the government broad authorityto tie up a firm's legitimate businesses, even when it isn'taccused of a crime. The implication is enormous for Drexel if anyof its employees are similarly accused of racketeering by a grandjury.</TEXT></DOC>
