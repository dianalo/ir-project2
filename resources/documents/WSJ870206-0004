Some planners indicate that versions of such a service could start up almost overnight. &quot;Our planning would go into high gear,&quot; says John Brayman, Ameritech's director of corporate strategy, in Chicago.    Electronic publishing is only one of the forthcoming battles expected among many powerful economic interests jockeying for advantage in a much more deregulated telecommunications industry.    Small manufacturers fear stepped up competition from the Bell companies. Long distance service companies, including American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., claim the local companies might abuse their control over the local network. And consumer groups worry that the price of service would rise if the Bell companies become involved in other markets. The Bell companies say the opponents simply fear competition.    Electronic-publishing proposals from the Bell companies for years have drawn protests from newspaper publishers who claim such a service would present a threat to competition and to the First Amendment. In addition, the issue offers a glimpse of the nature of the battles likely to emerge as the regional phone companies seek to compete with new products and services.    Electronic Yellow Pages could work one of two ways. Customers could dial an operator and request the number for, say, a plumber. The operator then would retrieve the information from the phone company's computerized-database &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; and pass it on to the caller. The second approach, bypassing an operator, would permit a caller with a computer to retrieve phone numbers and advertising directly from the phone company's database. The electronic service would be in addition to the current print directories.    &quot;We believe we could serve our customers and users better if we could offer an alternative to the plain printed Yellow Pages,&quot; says David L. Wibbelsman, president of Nynex Information Resources Co., a unit of Nynex Corp., New York.    Mr. Wibbelsman says Nynex probably would resurrect &quot;Hello Yellow,&quot; a Nynex electronic Yellow Page service that the federal government banned last year. A similar electronic publishing service was specifically banned at the time of the 1984 breakup of the Bell system.    For 10 years -- before and since the breakup -- the Bells have tried to enter electronic publishing but never have been able to win government approval.    The newspaper publishers warn that the phone companies, among other anti-competitive practices, could use their phone-lines monopoly to choke off transmission of other diverse sources of information. &quot;There has to be a real concern when one party has control of the information and the conduit through which the information flows,&quot; says Robert Johnson, publisher of Newsday and vice chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association's telecommunications commission.    Phone companies involved in electronic publishing would have &quot;the (financial) motivation and ability to discriminate&quot; against competitors, he says. He adds the publishers' group &quot;will do anything it can to protect the diversity principle&quot; -- which calls for free flow of information from diverse sources. He called the First Amendment the legal underpinning of that principle.    The printed Yellow Pages market currently totals $6 billion to $8 billion a year. While telephone companies agree that electronic Yellow Pages is an enticing area, they disagree about whether entering the business will expand the market or simply cause advertisers to shift some of their budgets from printed Yellow Pages to electronic.    Phone companies say the publishers only fear competition for advertising. &quot;That argument protects their own turf,&quot; says William L. Weiss, Ameritech's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;It is a defense of their own advertising.&quot; Adds Nynex's Mr. Wibbelsman: &quot;They have consistently wrapped their business concern in the cloak that we represent a threat to freedom of speech and freedom of information.&quot;    The Reagan administration this week sided with the regional Bells. The Justice Department proposed that they be allowed to make phone equipment, provide long-distance calling under certain conditions and offer information and computer services, including electronic Yellow Pages.    Moreover, Charles Rule, the agency's top antitrust enforcer, says he sees no threat to the First Amendment and notes that newspapers have a &quot;pecuniary interest&quot; in blocking the Bells.    Before the Bells could enter any of the business, however, federal Judge Harold Greene would have to agree to the recommendations. He enforces the Bell System divestiture agreement. The Justice Department's stance, nonetheless, represents a major advance in the phone companies' efforts toward entering electronic publishing.    But Jerry W. Friedheim, executive vice president of the publishers association, said the Justice Department &quot;cavalierly dismissed the potential for monopoly abuse by the Bell operating companies.&quot;    Ameritech's Mr. Brayman notes that the typical Yellow Page advertiser is a small or medium-size business with a limited advertising budget. Mr. Wibbelsman, on the other hand, says, &quot;You might see advertisers willing to spend additional money to have their product available in the electronic format.&quot;    Moreover, industry officials tout several advantages of electronic Yellow Pages over the printed version. Perhaps the most attractive would be the ability of advertisers to change the content of their ads more than one time a year. And consumers, phone companies say, would have a convenient alternative for seeking out advertisers. While advertisers would pay for placing their pitch electronically, consumers would pay for the phone call to tap the medium.    Electronic publishing might encompass other kinds of services as well. Mr. Wibbelsman says Nynex might be interested in &quot;an electronic magazine,&quot; noting that the company already publishes a magazine distributed to new home buyers or persons who have relocated. Ameritech says it is more interested, however, in providing the ability to transmit information rather than in generating the material itself. </TEXT></DOC>
