Reagan will probably go with a short, &quot;thematic&quot; speech stressing prosperity, competitiveness and individual initiative. But he isn't likely to offer anything dramatic enough to divert attention from the Iran scandal.    Disputes delay decisions on how hard to push catastrophic health insurance. Conservatives, led by Buchanan, press for strong statements backing the Contras and step-by-step deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative. One thing Reagan won't do: admit his Iran policy was a mistake. Best bet to be his &quot;heroes&quot; this year: Voyager pilots Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager.    But cynics suggest that a more appropriate choice would be Oliver North.    DEMOCRATS FACE tough choices on aid to Nicaragua's rebels.    They remain uncertain how hard to press the issue; party pols say the public cares far more about Iran. A House task force debates whether to push for a flat up-or-down vote this winter or for more limited steps like a moratorium. Since Reagan could veto any such change, some suggest, an even better strategy would be to concentrate on defeating his aid request for fiscal 1988.    The caution in Washington is at odds with fiercer opposition at the party's grass roots. Emotions run high in traditional anti-war, church and peace groups, which want the issue pressed now -- and will have a big say in choosing the party's 1988 presidential nominee. The issue would haunt potential candidates like Bradley and Nunn, who have backed Contra aid in the past.    TAX TINKERING draws intense attention from lobbyists.    They hope to use the &quot;technical corrections&quot; bill, designed to clean up last year's overhaul measure, as a vehicle. &quot;The pressure to reopen the tax bill is just under the surface,&quot; says one Ways and Means staffer. The National Association of Manufacturers eyes the minimum tax's treatment of heavy industry -- a potentially multibillion-dollar change that is hardly &quot;technical.&quot;    Meanwhile, real-estate lobbyists hope Bentsen will help them ease the law's tough anti-shelter provision. Both chairmen say they want the bill, expected to be introduced in about two months, to remain noncontroversial, but the special-interest pressures could hang up the measure and possibly delay it until next year.    That poses serious problems for the Treasury, which hopes to change an estate-tax provision that could cost it $7 billion or more.    BAKER SEEKS to defer a decision on Volcker's appointment, which expires in August. &quot;We have a Fed chairman with whom we're working quite well and have to continue to work well for six or seven months,&quot; says one official. &quot;So it might not be wise to make a decision now.&quot; But some at the White House favor prodding the Fed chief this spring to prepare for resignation.    BIDEN AND BUMPERS edge toward decisions on Democratic presidential bids. The Delaware senator says he hasn't decided, but his advisers plan to hire a campaign staff of 16 and ready a direct-mail operation. Arkansas's Bumpers is prodded to run by colleagues like Simon of Illinois and Baucus of Montana; he will decide within six weeks.    DRAFT DODGER Lee Iacocca will apparently get his wish: The effort to run him for president in 1988 is foundering. Several organizers actively seek other Democrats to back, finally convinced the Chrysler chairman won't be a candidate. In an understatement, one backer notes that the widely publicized breakup of Iacocca's marriage &quot;doesn't help.&quot;    PERFECTLY CLEAR? Vice President Bush, attempting to explain whether he or Reagan believed that arms were being traded to Iran to free the hostages, tells reporters: &quot;I know what I know is what he knows. . . . I don't know that I know everything.&quot;    SOVIET OVERTURES for an Afghanistan pullout impress few.    Rumors abound that the Afghan government next month will offer a Soviet proposal to withdraw its troops in 24 months or will suggest some sort of two-stage pullout. But such plans will find little favor with the Afghan rebels -- or the U.S. &quot;It took the Soviets two weeks to get in, and I don't see why it should take them more than two weeks to get out,&quot; Weinberger declares.    The U.S. wouldn't be sorry to see the Soviet peace offensive falter. Some think the Russians hope their effort will foment discord in Pakistan, where opposition parties may use it to oppose government policy of harboring Afghan guerrillas. Meanwhile, the war continues to damage the Soviets' Third World relations while draining their economy and military.    The rebels have found U.S.-supplied Stinger missiles especially effective in bringing down Russian aircraft.    MINOR MEMOS: Misreading the word &quot;succeed&quot; in his inaugural address, Gov. Clements declares: &quot;The people of Texas want us to secede.&quot; . . . Interior Secretary Hodel successfully defends his title of &quot;fastest politician&quot; in downhill skiing at the Governor's Cup Invitational in Telluride, Colo. . . . Fine print: The National Waterways Conference gives attendees a copy of a 236-page water bill -- and a pocket magnifier to read it with. </TEXT></DOC>
