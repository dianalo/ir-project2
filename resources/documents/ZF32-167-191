 For example, Fujitsu Ltd., 80% ownerof ICL of the U.K., bankrolled the English hardware firm with another $25million for the fiscal year just ended, after disappointing first halfresults.andM;Philips N.V.andP;  of the Netherlands planned to reduce its work force by 45,000after losing over $2 billion in the last fiscal year.andP;  Olivettu andamp; Co. ofItaly eliminated 7,000 positions last year, and was told by the governmentits special protections were at risk.andM;Groupe Bull of France, a firm subsidized by the French government for manyyears, planned to cut 5,000 jobs after record losses in 1990.andP;  And SiemensNixdorf Information Systems AG of Germany, underestimating the difficulty ofits October merger with Nixdorf Computer, announced that sales dropped off by12% in the five months after the merger.andM;&quot;The strength of the hardware industry in Europe is not what it used to be,&quot;said analyst Morgan David, European program manager for International DataCorp., Paris.andP;  &quot;Basically, the only solution for them is to move to opensystems and to put aside their proprietary systems.andP;  The only question is,Will they be strong enough to hold on until the investments pay off?&quot; hesaid.andM;At the Hannover Fair in Germany, held in March, two of the European hardwaresuppliers--Bull and Siemens Nixdorf--made announcements to bolster theirpresence in the open systems arena.andP;  Both companies are founding members ofthe Open Software Foundation, headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., and bothhave plans to use OSF software as key components of their strategies.andM;For Bull, an open systems strategy is a virtual must requirement.andP;  Thecompany's Gcos base, which is 90% of its base in the U.S., is not evenconsistent within itself.andP;  Gcos 6, developed in Boston, Gcos 7, developed inParis, and Gcos 8, developed in Phoenix, are all different operating systems.andM;The U.S.andP;  arm of Groupe Bull, Bull HN Information Systems, Inc., Billerica,Mass., accounts for 30% of total company revenue.andP;  Bull HN has recently hiredsome experienced software professionals.andP;  Ward MacKenzie, appointed anexecutive vice president in 1990, was formerly vice president of corporatemarketing for Data General Corp., Westborough, Mass., where he outlined thatfirm's open systems strategy.andP;  He is also the former CEO of Lisp Machine,Inc., and has held several positions at Digital Equipment Corp.andM;In 1989, Bull HN hired Burt Rubenstein, a founder of the former IndexTechnology, a leading supplier of Case tools.andP;  As director of technicalenhancements in Bull's corporate software group, Rubenstein is shepherdingthe company's move into the Case development tool arena.andM;At its unveiling of the Distributed Computing Model (DCM) at the HannoverFair, Bull had a number of U.S.andP;  software suppliers present to endorse theeffort.andP;  The president of Bull's European operation, Didier Ruffat, said, &quot;In1990, we tripled indirect business with our Unix parties, which now amountsto 15% of our business.&quot;andM;In another indication of its seriousness about software, Bull announced theacquisition of all or part of four systems and software suppliers based inGermany.andP;  &quot;We will do more things in the future,&quot; Ruffat said.andM;Bull has funded the development of products within its DCM to the tune of$250 million for the past two years, according to MacKenzie.andP;  A total of6,000 Randamp;D personnel in 11 facilities around the world are involved, he said.andM;The DCM scheme essentially calls for a series of operating system services tobe delivered around a Unix core.andP;  This core will probably be based on theOSF/1 operating system and the Distributed Computing Environment from OSF.andO;Bull is currently delivering on pieces of the strategy, such as software thatallows users to inter-operate from Gcos to Unix, and link MS-DOS PCs to Gcoshosts.andM;MacKenzie said DCM &quot;implies the integration of Gcos into a broader domain.andO;It provides a framework for Gcos users to take advantage of new functions.&quot;andO;He added, &quot;It's not our strategic objective to push people off Gcos and intoUnix.&quot;andP;  Gcos today is better suited for transaction processing, he said.andM;As part of the effort to stake out open systems turf, Bull demonstrated its&quot;Open Team&quot; implementation of OSF's Distributed Computing Environment code atthe Hannover Fair.andP;  &quot;We are adopting an aggressive open systems strategy,&quot;MacKenzie said.andM;What is not clear is whether Bull's open systems strategy can translate intoprofits.andP;  &quot;The bottom line for Bull is that DCM offers a framework for Bullin its own software development efforts,&quot;  MacKenzie said.andP;  Also not clear ishow long the French government will be willing to subsidize Bull.andM;Long range, Bull's plans are to develop network management applications atopDCE for delivery in 1992 and 1993; and extend DCM to enhance theinteroperability of Gcos and Unix in 1993 and 1994, MacKenzie said.andM;SIEMENS FORMING STRATEGYandM;Siemens Nixdorf also sounded the open systems theme at the Hannover Fair, butthe company was not ready to announce details of its strategy.andP;  Instead,Siemens executives fended off questions about recent financial results.andO;President Hans-Dieter Wiedig said he projects a loss for the year endingSept. 30; initial projections were for a break-even year.andM;Siemens is heavily invested in its BS2000 operating systems, whichconstituted one-third of its business in the current year, according to Dr.andO;Horst Nasko, vice president of the firm's managing board.andP;  The companyintends to keep BS2000 competitive with other mainframe operating systems,and to attach interfaces to open systems software, he said.andM;The Siemens push into open systems will be atop Sinix, the company's Unixvariation based on System V.andP;  The firm will work on having BS2000 and Sinixinteroperate, Nasko said.andP;  The firm's Universal Transaction Monitors work inboth its mainframe and Unix environments.andM;Asked whether the company intended to ally with software suppliers to helpmove to new markets, Dr. Nasko said the firm intends to continue to developits core systems software on its own, and work with software suppliers onapplications solutions.andM;Unlike Bull, Siemens had not software suppliers present at its meeting.andM;In an interview, Siemens Nixdorf Director of Marketing Eberhard Reichert,based in Munich, said, &quot;The BS2000 is a proprietary operating system, but wehave done a lot to open it up.andP;  We think there will never be a world whereevery software piece is standardized.andP;  You have to be competitive, so youhave to think about how to differentiate from your competitor.&quot;andM;Asked why the BS2000 has never been actively marketed in the U.S., Reichertsaid installing the infrastructure would have been too expensive.andP;  &quot;It madeno sense,&quot; he said.andP;  He added that the company may have made a mistake whenit passed up an opportunity to take over RCA's computer business.andP;  Instead,Univac bought the RCA base.andM;Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems, Inc., based in Burlington, Mass., isplanning to announce its software blueprint this months.andP;  &quot;The intent is toannounce relationships with certain software companies,&quot; said John Breda,vice president, software consulting and training for Siemens in the U.S.andP;  TheU.S.andP;  operations generated $300 million in revenue last year, Breda said.andO;&quot;Siemends Nixdorf&quot; is big in Europe, and it looks to the U.S.andP;  as the nextbiggest market it wants to be a player in,&quot; he said.andM;In the U.S., most of the company's revenue is coming from vertical markets,including retail and local government.andM;The company's open systems interest should help the U.S.andP;  side.andP;  &quot;Sinix willbecome known in the U.S.,&quot; Breda said.andP;  Both Siemens and Nixdorf werefounding members of OSF, he noted.andM;IDC's David sees consolidation ahead, &quot;because of the competitive beingbrought about by the opening up of the European market,&quot; and the increasedcompetition from U.S.andP;  firms.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
