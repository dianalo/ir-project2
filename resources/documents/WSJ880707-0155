The 13th congress of the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, opens today at a suburban Taipei stadium and then moves to a hillside convention hall to chart the party's future after six decades of leadership from the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty.    Mr. Lee, acting chairman of the 2.4 million-member party, is expected to be elected chairman tomorrow by the congress's 1,209 delegates. He has vowed to continue the political and social liberalization begun by Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek, who led the island until his death in January.    His success could depend on the new party and government lineup, which will determine how fast the Kuomintang moves forward with political, economic and social change.    The congress will elect a 180-member party Central Committee that will name a policy-making Central Standing Committee. A cabinet overhaul is likely after the meeting.    Old-guard conservatives who fled to Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek, after losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland, dominate both party committees. Many are expected to step down to make way for a new generation of leaders more sensitive to public opinion in Taiwan.    Mr. Lee, 65 years old, said he hopes the delegates would be &quot;expressing and stating in full during the meeting whatever opinion they may have. Only in this way can they convey fully the wishes of the public (and) set a truly democratic example for our party.&quot;    Since its founding on mainland China in 1894 by Sun Yat-sen, the father of modern China, power in the Kuomintang has flowed from the top down, while the party exercised authoritarian rule.    But Chiang Ching-kuo in the years before his death lifted 38-year-old martial law, allowed the formation of opposition parties and sought to increase the power of native Taiwanese, who constitute about 85% of the island's nearly 20 million people.    This is the first party congress in which delegates weren't handpicked by top officials and in which a Central Committee election wasn't restricted to candidates proposed by the party leader.    Lu Kuo-ming, 36 and an electronics engineer from San Jose, Calif., was among the 180 delegates from overseas. He acknowledged the congress would be &quot;a turning point,&quot; but said it wasn't likely all party elders would retire.    The congress will take up party policy toward Communist China.    Both the Nationalists and Communists claim to be the legitimate government of both the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. The Nationalists reject all official contacts with Beijing and haven't any plans to drop their stated goal of national reunification.    Last year, Chiang Ching-kuo ended a 38-year-old ban on travel to mainland China to allow family reunions. </TEXT></DOC>
