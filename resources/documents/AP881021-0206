The decison followed a protest by environmentalists claiming thedumping would hurt marine life.   The government said the plans were abandoned because bad weatherhad damaged the 58,000-ton vessel, the Reijin, making it impossibleto float the ship far enough out to sea to dump the cars.   ``Because of the weather, the Reijin's hull has fractured,''Jose Macario Correia, secretary of state for the environment andnatural resources, told The Associated Press.   ``The cars will probably be transported to the shore anddisposed of, and we are also looking into ways of dismantling theship totally to bring it to shore,'' he said.   The announcement came after a group of environmentalists boardedthe ship early Friday and unfurled banners with message ``Not intothe sea!'' to protest the planned dumping.   ``This is a victory for us,'' said Vitor Marques, spokesman forthe Portuguese environmentalist group Quercus. Earlier, marinepolice detained three Quercus protesters after the police boardedthe ship to put out a small fire of unknown cause.   The three were taken to the police court at Vila Nova de Gaia, asuburb on the southern outskirts of Oporto, a police spokesmansaid. He declined to say how long they would be detained.   Marques earlier said the protesters would stay on the ship untilthe Portuguese government took action to stop the dumping.   The Panamanian-registered Reijin was on its maiden voyage fromJapan to Ireland when it ran aground April 27 off the northern cityof Oporto. It had stopped in Oporto to unload some of its cargo ofabout 5,400 new Japanese cars. One sailor died in the accident.   The ship's owner, Emerald Shipholding SA, a Japanese-owned,Panamanian company, began dumping cars into the Atlantic Ocean inSeptember as part of a project to get rid of both the ship and itscargo.   Officials said the ship couldn't be recovered and the cars mightbe unsafe for use after being stuck for six months so close to seawater.   Ecologists say the estimated total of 173 tons of copper andlead, 115 tons of paint, 28 tons of oil and more than 1,000 tons ofrubber, plastics and textiles contained in the cars could also hurtmarine life.   The navy issued a dumping permit August and installed observersto ensure the cargo was sunk at least 40 miles from shore.   Marques said the Greenpeace environmental group had sent anofficial to give Quercus its support. The two groups issued astatement Friday demanding that the Reijin be towed into a harborand that the cars be unloaded and disposed of on shore.</TEXT></DOC>
