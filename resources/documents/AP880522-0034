SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George Shultz, saying it's``time to decide,'' urged the Senate on Sunday to approve theU.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles in timefor the summit between Mikhail Gorbachev and President Reagan.   The secretary of state also echoed the positive remarksGorbachev made in an interview with U.S. reporters, in which theSoviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing inhalf the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons beforeReagan leaves office.   ``It's certainly possible,'' Shultz said of prospects for such atreaty. Speaking on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' thesecretary added: ``And I feel certain that at the Moscow summit wewill both want to agree to keep working on it hard. But whether itwill actually happen or not, I don't know. The issues are tough.''   The president leaves Wednesday, stopping first in Helsinki,Finland, before traveling on to Moscow for the May 29-June 2 summit.   Queried about talks on the disputed Strategic DefenseInitiative, which has hampered agreement on a strategic missilepact, Shultz said Reagan has staunchly opposed any impediment tothe development of a defense against ballistic missiles.   ``That still leaves room for a lot of things,'' the secretarysaid, pointing to a ``period of non-withdrawal'' from theAnti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which the Soviets contend barscertain elements of the president's space-based missile defenseprogram, also known as Star Wars.   On Saturday, Reagan used his radio address to appeal forratification of the medium-range missile treaty, formally known asthe pact on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces.   It was signed by the two leaders at their December summit inWashington and administration officials are eager to display theratified treaty as a boost for the president in his negotiationswith Gorbachev.   While the Senate has turned aside a wave of amendments designedby its conservative opponents to kill the treaty, debate isexpected to continue through much of the week. Approval of the pactrequires 67 votes, if all 100 senators are present.   Shultz, who is to carry his campaign for the pact to CapitolHill on Monday, pointed out that more than a dozen years havepassed since the United States has ratified a treaty with theSoviet Union, and that it would help the president in his effortsat the summit if the treaty were approved.   ``It helps certainly to have completed something and to registerthat fact. ... It's good to register the fact that we can do it,''Shultz said.   The secretary, avoiding any criticism of the president'sconservative allies who oppose the treaty, lauded the Senate forits thorough consideration of the pact.   ``I think the process has gone well. I have only compliments forthe Senate and the way in which they've handled this,'' he said,adding, ``I think there's been a time for hearings, a time forquestions, a time for critiques and a time for debate. There alsohas to come a time to decide and I think we're about there.''   Appearing on the same program, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Armed Services Committee, said he believed the treaty will beready in time for the two leaders to sign.   ``We will finish the INF treaty, prior not to the presidentdeparting, but prior to the actual meetings,'' he said, adding,``That's a guess and I give it 60-40 odds.''   Senate Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he's counted some 78``very firm'' votes for the treaty. ``I don't think the presidentshould go empty-handed,'' said Cranston, appearing on NBC-TV's``Meet The Press.''   On the same show, treaty opponent Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,called the pact ``very one-sided and very, very dangerous,'' andone that would allow the Soviets an unfair advantage.   The spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, GennadyGerasimov, said on the same show that U.S. officials had predictedat the December summit that the treaty would be ratified by April.   ``And now it is May. We simply expect, that if you promise thenyou must deliver. But we also understand your political system,''Gerasimov said.   He said it would be considered ``a good sign of your willingnessto improve relations between our countries if you ratify the treatyby the time of the Moscow summit.''</TEXT></DOC>
