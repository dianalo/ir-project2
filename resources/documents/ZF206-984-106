(Software Review) (one of seven evaluations of MIDIproducts for the PC) (evaluation)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lerhman, Paul D.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Finale is a music notation program developed by CODA todistinguish notes that are being played into scores of music.andP;  Theprogram charts the music either one note at a time or as they areplayed in a musical presentation.andP;  Lyrics can be linked to thenotes within the score.andP;  The program allows users to definewritten representations on the music and retain them in memory forfuture use.andP;  Finale is a very complex program that is difficult touse even within the Macintosh graphical user interface.andP;  Theprogram is expected to be ported to the IBM later in 1989.andP;  Finaleis one of the most expensive pieces of music software, with a listprice of $1,000.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Wenger Corp.
