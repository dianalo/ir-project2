As Capt. Will Rogers' guided-missile cruiser, the USS Vincennes,exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats, Iran Air Flight 655 appearedon the U.S. warship's high-tech radar. Mistaken reports said theaircraft appeared to be descending and accelerating, as ifattacking; it failed to respond to warnings on civilian and militarychannels.   Rogers gave the order to fire. The decision, he later said, wasin defense of his ship and crew. But what Rogers feared was anIranian F-14 fighter actually was an Airbus A300 with 290 peopleaboard, all of whom died.   The Reagan administration defended the decision but also decidedto compensate the victims' families. Among the dead: a woman flyingwith her eight children to meet her husband; an Iranian coupleflying to Dubai to shop for a daughter's wedding.   Three days later, a North Sea oil and gas platform exploded,killing 167 men in the world's worst-ever oilfield disaster andcreating another list of private tragedies. A bride of a few weeksbecame a widow; a teen-ager who had worked offshore only a few daysdied, as did a man who had volunteered to return to work a weekearly.   AIDS killed its 45,000th American victim. More than 7,000researchers from 140 countries gathered in Sweden, where theyexamined 3,200 reports on the fatal disease and agreed they had madelittle progress toward treatment or cure.   In the United States, a new AIDS case was being reported every 14minutes, for a total of more than 30,000 in 1988. New York Citybegan a needle exchange program to try to curb the disease's spreadamong needle-sharing drug addicts.   Drug use overshadowed the Summer Olympics in Seoul, whereCanadian sprinter Ben Johnson lost his gold medal, his 9.79 worldrecord in the 100-yard dash and millions in endorsements when testsshowed he had used muscle-building anabolic steroids.   The Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, produced heroes who wonno medals. Speed skater Dan Jansen became the world's Heartbreak Kidwith his decision to compete _ and his subsequent fall _ hours afterhis sister's death.   As winter turned to spring, the fickle weather that had delayedski and sled events in Calgary became devastating drought acrossAmerica, baking the nation's farmland and turning the mightyMississippi into a muddy mess impassable for weeks. Crops andprofits shriveled in the fields as grain production dropped byone-third, but the farmer got some help from Congress _ $3.9 billionin drought relief.   There was little relief on the other side of the world as floodssubmerged three-fourths of Bangladesh, stranding at least 20 millionpeople who were forced to eat raw food and drink contaminated water.As if the tiny country had not suffered enough, cyclones laterkilled thousands.   Hurricane Gilbert blasted across Jamaica, bounced off the CaymanIslands and careened toward Texas, but the U.S. coast was spared inthe end. All told, the storm caused billions of dollars in damage,mostly to Jamaica and Mexico, where more than 200 people died.   In the skies, there were tragedies, triumphs and a couple ofmiracles.   A collision by three jets trying to create an aerial valentine atan airshow in West Germany killed 70 people. An explosion of amilitary plane killed Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and 28others, changing that country's destiny. Benazir Bhutto became primeminister, the office once held by her father, deposed and hanged byZia 11 years ago.   The roof of a Hawaiian island-hopping Boeing 737 ripped away likea can under an opener, but the plane landed safely, with only onedeath. In a Delta crash at Dallas, 13 people died, but 95 survivedwhat early reports called a ``non-survivable'' accident.   And millions held their breath as the space shuttle Discoveryreadied for launch, the first since the Challenger disaster 32months earlier. On the ground at Cape Canaveral, space veteranRobert Crippen made the final decision to ``go.''   A relieved nation cheered as the shuttle safely passed the pointwhere the Challenger had exploded.   ``Each one of us knows where our place in the future is, whereAmericans should be _ it's in space,'' Discovery astronaut David C.Hilmers said. ``So let's ... make this adventure happen again andagain and again.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Year-End Editions</NOTE></DOC>
