But the quarterly gain was significantly exaggerated by a slew of nonrecurring charges and credits, especially in the year-earlier period, and most analysts expect a slowdown in earnings this year.    In the quarter ended Dec. 31, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 487 major corporations rose 41% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. Net income soared 51%, compared with a 33% rise in the third quarter, a 21% drop in the second and a 13% gain in the first.    The 51% surge was the biggest since a 58% increase in the 1984 first quarter, during the recovery from the 1981-82 recession. It reflected, in part, strong sales in a wide variety of industries. But it also reflected the fact that corporate restructuring at the manufacturing level, which had caused huge write-offs in the 1986 fourth quarter, is largely over.    A couple of examples illustrate how the special charges muddied the picture. In the 1987 fourth quarter, 13 aerospace companies reported net income of $1.22 billion, up 1,869% from a year earlier. However, that big increase was largely due to huge special charges in the 1986 period -- $420 million at General Dynamics for its Cessna general-aviation unit and $347 million at United Technologies for restructuring.    Similarly, 13 telephone companies' net income in the latest quarter was $2.84 billion, up 404% from the 1986 period, when American Telephone andamp; Telegraph had a $1.7 billion restructuring charge.    The just-ended quarter also was affected by some big nonrecurring items, however. Most notably, the petroleum group hit red ink because of Texaco's $4.9 billion of charges stemming mostly from its settlement with Pennzoil.    &quot;The year-to-year comparisons don't mean anything,&quot; says Jerry L. Jordan, the chief economist of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, &quot;but they can't hide the fact that 1987 was a good year for profits.&quot; Mitchell J. Held, the chief financial economist of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., attributes the 1987 gains mainly to &quot;the return of some pricing power, weakness in the exchange value of the dollar, and sharply reduced average costs.&quot;    Industries showing sharp fourth-quarter gains from 1986 included chemicals and forest products, both helped by strong exports; industrial and farm equipment, also aided by the weak dollar; oil-field services, on a rebound in drilling plus some special items; railroads; office equipment and computers; and autos.    Not faring so well in the latest quarter were the banks, hit by increases in loan-loss reserves; securities firms, clobbered by the stock-market crash; and thrifts, hurt by higher deposit costs and a huge loss at Financial Corp. of America.    Looking ahead, the economists surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, expect, on the average, pretax profits to rise 2.9% this year and 5.6% in 1989. The spread of their predictions is unusually wide. For this year, for instance, the top 10 forecasts, on the average, call for a 12% gain; the bottom 10, a 9.4% drop.    The differing forecasts reflect, of course, different views of the economy. Data Resources, for instance, expects it to be on the brink of a recession in the first half, with only a modest recovery later this year; not surprisingly, the consulting firm also expects a slump in after-tax profits.    Here are the fourth-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s have been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Military-procurement reforms, increased competition and a tight defense budget continued to affect aerospace earnings. Some companies rebounded from year-earlier write-offs, including Northrop's $105 million charge for its now-defunct F-20 fighter, General Dynamics' $420 million charge for its Cessna unit, Fairchild Industries' big tax-credit reversal and United Technologies' provision for restructuring and employee severance, without which earnings would have been $119 million. In the latest period, GenCorp posted a $242 million gain from sale of discontinued operations. McDonnell Douglas wrote off $14 million before taxes for discontinued space and missile operations and $13.6 million before taxes for modifications to the F/A-18 aircraft. Lockheed had a $15 million loss from discontinued shipbuilding operations. Rockwell's profit from electronics was hit by a $30 million pretax charge. In the commercial business, McDonnell Douglas had a $40 million pretax gain from the sale of DC-9 aircraft that had been leased and a $12 million pretax gain for the sale of an interest in a leasing venture. The company's net income was aided by a $46.2 million pretax gain due to a pension-accounting change; Boeing's was increased $39 million. The decline in the corporate tax rate increased McDonnell Douglas's net by $27 million, and General Dynamics had a $20 million gain from paying deferred taxes at a lower rate than it had been accruing them. For 1988, analysts expect operating profits to be flat or lower as the defense budget grows tighter, but they say tax gains will help net income.                              4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    13 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Boeing Co                141,000      191,000   -  26    Fairchild Inds               487     - 73,643     ...

Increased revenue from higher fares also failed to offset added costs for maintenance and service improvements. Pan Am's wider-than-expected deficit of $245.5 million, due partly to foreign-exchange losses from its yen-denominated debt, threw the group into the red. AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent, was hurt by high taxes related to plane leases, a Christmas strike threat by flight attendants and a $23.1 million pretax charge from foreign-currency losses. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had pretax gains exceeding $17 million. Delta Air Lines' profit increased, excluding a $50.8 million year-earlier gain from aircraft sales; the carrier was helped by its addition of Western Airlines. Trans World's net included gains of $30 million from the sale of Texaco securities and more than $20 million from other securities sales; the gains were partly offset by $25 million of additional interest expense. Year-earlier results were lifted by a $122.3 million gain from the sale of the airline's PARS reservations system. Allegis Corp., United's parent, reported a $270.5 million gain from sale of its Hilton International and Hertz units, but the company also had $75 million of nonrecurring charges. Texas Air blamed its huge loss on labor strife at its Eastern Airlines unit, high debt costs and bad weather. The company also had more than $31 million in special charges at its Continental Airlines unit. Southwest Airlines benefited from a $646,000 net gain due to liquidation of its TranStar unit. The industry's earnings are expected to be weak in the traditionally slow first quarter.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    9 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Allegis Corp             209,943     - 13,592     ...

APPAREL   Results for makers of women's apparel were &quot;disappointing in the fourth quarter, but menswear companies did better,&quot; says Jay Meltzer, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. analyst. Makers of women's clothing &quot;shared fully the retailers' problems of markdowns, and therefore the manufacturers didn't get the expected reorders,&quot; he adds. For the first quarter, he notes, &quot;there is still an inventory problem out there in women's wear.&quot; In addition, women's-wear companies import many of their goods and were hurt by the weak dollar. Phillips-Van Heusen's fiscal-third-period profit was enhanced by its recent acquisition of the Bass shoe business and a gain from pension recovery. Hartmarx's profit surged 49%; year-earlier earnings were depressed by restructuring costs. Stride Rite attributed its profit gain to resurgent popularity of its Keds canvas shoes.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    8 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Brown Group               15,486       13,793    +  12    Genesco Inc                6,507       11,092    -  41    Hartmarx Corp             15,660       10,505    +  49    Oxford Inds              - 2,298        2,935      ...

Though a sharp jump from the $1.49 billion a year earlier, that disappointed analysts, some of whom expected as much as $2.5 billion. Both Ford Motor and Chrysler fell below expectations, partly because of high marketing costs from intense rebate campaigns. Chrysler also had higher-than-expected costs from its American Motors acquisition. GM did much better than anticipated, partly because of strength in its overseas operations. In addition, the No. 1 auto maker's year-to-year comparison was helped substantially by a $1.22 billion pretax charge in the 1986 fourth quarter and an accounting change in late 1987, which lifted fourth-quarter earnings, by some estimates, more than $200 million. GM's continued cost-cutting, as well as its new equipment-amortization accounting, could give the industry a boost in the first quarter. But as the long-expected overcapacity problem in the U.S. automotive industry develops and as sales fall from the healthy 1987 levels, earnings in the 1988 first quarter may trail those of a year ago.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    13 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Champion Spk Plg      -      200        1,500     ...

Many regionals, led by Bank of Boston, figured that 1987 results already were depressed by second-quarter additions to loan-loss reserves for debt to developing nations, and so they raised reserves again in the fourth period. That put many of them in the red. A few money-center banks, including Security Pacific, Continental Illinois and First Chicago, also added reserves, but the New York banks held to their current reserve levels. Coupled with one-time gains, that enabled most money-center banks to post higher profits. The fourth quarter produced some spectacular gains in foreign-exchange and bond trading for money-center banks, especially for Bankers Trust New York. Continental Illinois reported a loss on its stock-options trading unit. Citicorp also had big gains on Manhattan real-estate sales. Manufacturers Hanover posted special charges for restructuring and a work-force reduction. Banks' 1988 prospects are mediocre. Net interest margins are under pressure, commercial-loan volume remains subdued and consumer borrowing is weakening. Most banks, however, seem to be controlling costs and leaving marginally profitable businesses.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    24 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Bank of Boston          - 41,400       64,800     ...

PepsiCo's soft-drink volumes, buoyed by the rebound of Mountain Dew and the introduction of Diet Mountain Dew, rose about 6.3% in 1987, compared with the industry average of about 5.5%, John Maxwell of Wheat First Securities says. General Cinema posted a $14 million loss from discontinued operations and a $13.4 million after-tax charge related to a decision to sell operations of the Super Video retailing unit; earnings also included a pretax gain of $22 million primarily from the Carter Hawley Hale restructuring. The company was hurt by competition from Coca-Cola Enterprises because that bottler discounted heavily. Anheuser-Busch once again outsold the competition, registering a 5% gain in unit volume for the year, while the industry grew only about 0.5%. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow 15% or more in 1988.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    7 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Anheuser-Busch           109,579       93,743   +  17    Brown-Forman Inc          37,073       26,222   +  41    Coca-Cola Co             192,955      314,535   -  39    Coors (Adolph)             3,655        4,041   -  10    General Cinema            15,576       58,568   -  73    Glenmore Distill        -    245       22,114     ...

Moreover, Cornelius Sewell, an Argus Research analyst, says it is &quot;a lot less sensitive to trends in housing&quot; than in the past because it is more diversified. Thus, he predicts a fair first quarter even if housing starts drop 5% to 10%. Guy Nielsen of Brown Brothers Harriman notes that the cement business remained sluggish. He expects the first quarter to benefit from lower interest rates, although comparisons with a year ago could be difficult because the weather, a crucial factor in winter, was warm last year. American Standard's year-earlier quarter included a $6.8 million gain on the sale on discontinued operations. Ideal reported a $9.2 million year-earlier loss from discontinued operations and a $76 million gain from debt restructuring. For the latest quarter, Lone Star posted a $49.2 million pretax gain on asset dispositions; a year earlier, it had a $138.6 million pretax gain. In the latest quarter, Manville had a $91.5 million charge related to a personal-injury settlement, and Owens-Corning had a $12 million gain for recalculation of a gain from sale of its aerospace and strategic-materials group.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    13 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    American Standard         41,300       33,000   +  25    Armstrong World           33,500       25,900   +  29    Certain-Teed Corp         12,549       10,720   +  17    Corning Glass             59,000       34,300   +  72    Giant Group Ltd          - 3,805       14,016     ...

Many of the companies are operating at capacity, and instead of expanding production, they have raised prices in markets in which supplies are short. They expect the favorable industry conditions to continue, resulting in strong earnings in 1988. Dow Chemical, for example, predicts record operating profit and net income for this year. In an industry still restructuring because of the problems of excess capacity and haphazard growth of the late 1970s and early 1980s, many companies posted special items from asset sales. Monsanto had a $10 million gain from restructuring, and American Cyanamid a $5.7 million gain from equity in associated companies. But Hercules posted a $10.9 million charge related to foreign-currency adjustments and taxes. Union Carbide's net included a $53 million charge, mostly to cover contingencies related to the Bhopal chemical-plant litigation.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %   21 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg   Air Pdts andamp; Chem           55,352       35,375   +  56   American Cyanamid         60,200       52,100   +  16   Dow Chemical             352,000      168,000   + 110   Du Pont Co               439,000      335,000   +  31   Engelhard Corp            12,693       14,291   -  11   Ethyl Corp                52,921       45,796   +  16   Goodrich B F Co           20,500       13,000   +  58   Grace W R                 50,092     -559,903     ...

DRUG MAKERS   Earnings advanced briskly, especially for drug makers with new, high-priced prescription drugs. Several companies also benefited from lower federal tax rates, increased revenue from foreign operations because of currency translations, and cost-cutting. Merck's earnings surged on a powerful lineup of big-selling, high-profit drugs; sales also were bolstered by the weak dollar. Johnson andamp; Johnson's big gain was largely attributable to a year-earlier $45 million charge related to sale of a diagnostic-imaging business. Schering-Plough sales rose on a slew of new products, and Bristol-Myers and Warner-Lambert benefited from robust sales of consumer-health products. Rorer rebounded from a yearearlier loss stemming from a discontinued operation. Squibb's profit trailed the 1986 quarter, which had a gain from sale of a unit. Pfizer's tumbled because of sluggish sales of its arthritis drug, Feldene, which is facing stiff competition, and SmithKline's drop reflected interest expense due to a share-repurchase program.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    15 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Abbott Labs              190,053      160,598   +  18    Am Home Pdts             215,203      199,370   +   8    Bristol-Myers            174,071      151,702   +  15    Eli Lilly andamp; Co           138,200      124,300   +  11    Johnson andamp; Johnson        163,000       97,000   +  68    Merck andamp; Co               232,400      171,800   +  35    Pfizer Inc               136,600      158,400   -  14    Rorer Group               22,456   -    6,286     ...

The overall strength is expected to continue. &quot;There will be strong earnings gains in 1988,&quot; says Linda M. Shuman of Prudential-Bache Securities. A robust capital-spending outlook aids many suppliers of electrical equipment. So does the weak dollar, which helps U.S. producers compete with foreign companies. Even if industry conditions sour, some companies, such as General Electric, are so diversified that not much damage would be incurred. The recent restructurings, meanwhile, will enhance this year's performance at such companies as Baldor Electric and Square D, whose fourth quarters were hurt by restructuring charges. As happened earlier in 1987, semiconductor companies tended to show the best gains; they are still recovering from a slump. The outlook may be poorest for companies highly dependent on consumer spending.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    26 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    AMP Inc                   70,000       46,307   +  51    AVX Corp                   4,598      - 1,015     ...

Gerber Products' earnings rose 67%, but the year-earlier profit was hurt by the scare over reports of glass in baby food. Gerber's tax rate fell to 37% from 46.6%. Kraft's latest quarter included a hefty charge to repatriate funds from foreign subsidiaries; otherwise, earnings would have increased. Acquisitions and a lower tax rate contributed to Dean Foods' 62% earnings jump. Archer-Daniels-Midland nearly doubled earnings as soy-processing margins and Soviet soy imports rose. But poultry proved troublesome for Holly Farms; that division reported a loss, against record earnings a year earlier. Although Quaker Oats' net dropped 48%, results from continuing operations improved; last year's net included a $55.8 million gain from sale of Quaker's specialty retailing business. Ralston Purina's earnings also were affected by asset sales in both quarters; profit on continuing operations rose 14%. International Multifoods' earnings surged with the aid of improved Venezuelan operations and more favorable currency and tax rates. Staley Continental's operating earnings slumped, but net soared 416%, reflecting a lower tax rate and a debt-redemption charge last year. Analysts are cautious about the group's future earnings, noting that after midyear the lower tax rates will no longer bolster year-to-year comparisons.

Lumber prices were pushed down a bit, however, by fears of a possible construction slowdown. Louisiana-Pacific's operating income in the latest period nearly doubled, but net income fell because the year-earlier figure was inflated by a $123 million special gain from reversal of income taxes. Westvaco benefited from an $11.7 million after-tax gain from 1987 timberland sales. In the 1986 fourth quarter, Mead had a $48.8 million loss from discontinued operations and a $7.1 million charge for repurchase of debt; Boise-Cascade posted pretax charges totaling $18.5 million; Federal Paper Board had a $15.1 million charge for debt retirement, and International Paper reported pretax gains of $32 million from a partnership offering and $41 million from a property sale, partially offset by a $31 million pretax charge for staff-relocation and plant-closure expenses. Paper and pulp prices are expected to remain strong through 1988, promising continued solid earnings growth for the industry.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    17 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Boise Cascade             57,220       31,970   +  79    Champion Int'l            82,140       64,542   +  27    Federal Paper Board       25,131      - 1,450     ...

American Stores says &quot;lower-than-targeted&quot; sales hurt profit margins; its operating profit was off 4.5% before a hefty gain from the sale of some drugstores as well as lower taxes. Lucky's net was helped by an $8.4 million after-tax gain from transfer of certain stores to a partnership in which the company holds an interest; its year-earlier earnings were ballooned by $182.1 million in income from discontinued operations, partly offset by after-tax charges of $15.9 million for restructuring and $7.3 million for early debt retirement. Borman's loss partly reflected an $11.7 million charge for termination payments to employees. The year-earlier quarter was affected by many special items: Aandamp;P was helped by a $7.7 million tax credit. Kroger was hurt by after-tax charges of $12.7 million for loss of investment tax credits and $10 million due to setting up a charitable foundation. Giant Food said year-earlier results were damaged by price cuts linked to a now-discontinued move to warehouse pricing.

Occupancy rates have stabilized, but more beds are filled by lowmargin Medicare patients. &quot;The real apples-to-apples results for hospital companies aren't in the direction that their {strong} bottom lines would indicate,&quot; says Seth Shaw of Prudential-Bache Securities. National Medical Enterprises and Charter Medical benefited from strong performances in specialty hospitals. American Medical's net included a $50.7 million gain from an accounting change and a $33.9 million charge for a debt repurchase. Hospital Corp. of America reported a profit, against a year-earlier loss, which included a $77 million charge to increase liability-insurance reserves and reverse investment tax credits. Humana had a $16.1 million loss from a debt repurchase, offset by a $16.2 million gain from a retirement-accounting change. Beverly Enterprises, a nursing-home operator, posted much wider losses, mainly because of higher labor costs and declining occupancy rates. Hospital-supply companies are being helped by the weak dollar's effect on overseas sales and higher demand for surgical supplies. In addition, Baxter Travenol had an $8 million gain from sale of a pharmaceutical division.

The companies continued to shed unprofitable operations, mostly in the oil patch, and concentrate on more commercial and light-industrial work. Ameron had a $2 million loss for nonrecurring expenses and write-offs due to the restructuring of several units. Blount's profit in its Nov. 30 quarter included a $1.3 million gain from an inventory-accounting change. Dravo's deficit reflected a $76.6 million loss from discontinued operations, compared with a similar year-earlier loss of $21.6 million; both periods had much smaller profits from continuing businesses. Fluor's earnings included a $111.2 million gain from asset sales; a year earlier, it had a $33.5 million loss from discontinued operations. Analysts say the industry's outlook is brighter than it has been for some time. Robert W. McCoy Jr. of Kidder Peabody says the movement away from energy projects is beginning to lift some earnings. But he warns that increased competition from European and Japanese rivals as well as continued costs of restructuring will make the turnaround a slow one.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    5 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Ameron Inc                 3,116        5,146   -  39    Blount Inc                 3,803        2,428   +  57    Dravo Corp              - 72,393      -18,469     ...

HOME BUILDERS   Except for continued strength in the hot California market, home builders saw more weakness in demand caused by higher mortgage rates and buyer uncertainty after the stock-market crash. However, builders are optimistic that currently lower rates will bring out home buyers during the rest of the first quarter. Los Angeles-based Kaufman andamp; Broad's $350 million year-end backlog was double the 1986 level. Ryland Group, of Columbia, Md., saw sales drop in its Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Florida regions while edging higher in Texas, Denver and Phoenix. A big boost came from M.J. Brock, a California builder Ryland purchased in 1986. Ryland's profit included a $2.5 million charge for the write-up in value of some property acquired in the Brock purchase. U.S. Home's home-building unit was profitable despite an 11% drop in sales, but the Houston builder set aside reserves of $35.9 million to cover losses from its mortgage unit and its discontinued manufactured-housing operations. Additional reserves of $12.3 million were established to cover possible losses from a decision not to exercise some land-purchase options.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    4 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Centex                     6,093        9,646   -  37    Kaufmanandamp;BroadHm           15,713       15,207   +   3    Ryland Group               4,834        7,259   -  33    U S Home                 -46,721        2,499     ...

The brightening outlook led Caterpillar and Deere to raise their dividends in December. &quot;They had a disaster in 1986 and made a lot of money in 1987; it's two completely different worlds,&quot; says Eli Lustgarten, a PaineWebber analyst. Caterpillar's profit included a $31 million tax benefit; Deere's year-earlier loss reflected a strike. Special items affected many of the companies. Cincinnati Milacron was hurt by an $83 million restructuring charge, and Interlake's profit gain was held down by a $27.5 million charge. National-Standard's profit included a $2.8 million tax benefit and a $4.3 million net gain related to a pension plan. In the year-earlier period, Ingersoll-Rand had a $13.1 million gain on asset sales and a $6.7 million charge from extinguishment of debt, Trinova had a $9.7 million net charge, and Ametek posted an $8.9 million pretax charge. Largely because of the weak dollar, Mitchell Quain, a Wertheim Schroder analyst, sees profits for most of the group up 20% in the first quarter from a year ago. &quot;Any U.S. commodity companies that have lost market share on the world market are more competitive today and are investing in big machinery,&quot; he says.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    13 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    AM International           6,593        5,548   +  19    Ametek Inc                10,598        9,895   +   7    Caterpillar Inc          170,000     -148,000     ...

Such sales produced a quarterly loss at Continental. But operating profit excluding those capital losses rose at Continental, Aetna and many other companies, partly because of tax benefits from restating reserves as required by the 1986 tax act. At Kemper and Primerica, brokerage subsidiaries posted operating losses because of the stock-market plunge. Continuing losses in health insurance hurt net at Lincoln National and Travelers. The insurers' operating results were somewhat below analysts' expectations. With property and casualty insurance prices now in a cyclical slide and the special tax benefits ebbing, analysts expect 1988 -- or maybe even 1987 -- to be the peak earnings year of this cycle.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    16 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Aetna Life andamp; Cas         197,500      284,900   -  31    American General         108,878      236,422   -  54    Chubb Corp                51,300       62,600   -  18    CIGNA Corp               134,700      317,100   -  58    Continental Corp        - 11,800      120,100     ...

Analysts see a strong first quarter for some broadcasters and local stations; print advertising's outlook isn't as sure. Capital Cities/ABC's net rose sharply on a spurt in ad sales at its eight local stations, plus lower taxes and lower costs. CBS profit rose 13% despite an apparent loss at the TV network. Gulf andamp; Western's 25% rise was even higher if the 1986 quarter's $38.7 million gain from a real-estate sale is excluded. Net of Warner Communications was aided by strong movie, music and cable-TV results. Time Inc.'s net rebounded despite a charge from sale of a market-research unit; a year earlier, the company had an even bigger charge. Washington Post Co.'s increase was mostly due to a $23.5 million gain from sale of cellular-phone operations. Both Tribune Co. and Meredith were helped because the companies had nonrecurring charges a year earlier. But Times-Mirror's net fell because of a $25.3 million after-tax loss on sale of the Denver Post. Chris-Craft had a $6.7 million gain a year earlier from a pension-plan surplus, and the 1987 quarter earnings were hurt by poor TV ad sales.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    19 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Cap Cities/ABC          116,984        80,324   +  46    CBS Inc                 251,600       223,000   +  13    Chris-Craft Inds          7,632        12,452   -  39    Dow Jones andamp; Co           50,345        46,498   +   8    Dun andamp; Bradstreet         87,414        76,739   +  14    Grolier Inc               7,636         7,193   +   6    Gulf andamp; Western          131,500       105,400   +  25    Knight-Ridder            50,048        43,698   +  15    Macmillan Inc            15,393        14,982   +   3    MCA Inc                  21,808        17,314   +  26    McGraw-Hill              49,927        42,003   +  19    Meredith Corp            14,681         4,249   + 246    N Y Times Co             42,492        34,758   +  22    Time Inc                 52,000        12,000   + 333    Times Mirror Co          54,704        99,324   -  45    Tribune Co               43,215        21,358   + 102    Walt Disney Co          100,436        89,831   +  12    Warner Commun            92,016        62,022   +  48    Washington Post Co       64,418        36,271   +  78    TOTAL                 1,254,249     1,029,416   +  22   NONFERROUS METALS   Aluminum earnings were robust, reflecting an extended industry upturn. Alcoa was aided by $38.5 million in inventory-liquidation profit, up from $24 million a year earlier; the 1986 period's earnings also were bolstered by a $138.2 million after-tax gain from a real-estate sale and other nonrecurring items. KaiserTech swung into the black, aided by a $52.7 million pretax gain from sale of its Kaiser Aluminium Europe Inc. unit; in the 1986 quarter, it had a pretax loss of $59.4 million and a pretax gain of $16.9 million. At Reynolds Metals, the 1986 period included a $116.2 million pretax gain from sale of Robertshaw Controls stock. Analysts expect industry earnings, buoyed by tight metal supplies, brisk demand and higher fabricated-product prices, to remain strong all year. In metals mining, most companies posted sharp fourth-quarter gains as metals prices rose. Both Asarco and Phelps Dodge were helped because restructurings have cut costs. Asarco's net also included gains from the sale of an interest in Asarco Australia Ltd. and the recovery of excess pension funds. M.A. Hanna's 1986 results included $121.5 million in restructuring charges. However, AMAX's loss widened sharply, largely because of a big write-down. Ron Shorr of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. expects 1988 net to jump 20% to 50% at almost every mining company.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    9 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Aluminum Co Am           132,800      165,300   -  20    AMAX                    -280,800     - 49,700     ...

The worst performer was Tandem Computers, which posted the group's only profit drop. International Business Machines' 50% gain would have been much weaker without special items and currency translations, but the disclosure that its hardware margins rose at the end of 1987 suggests that the beleaguered giant's outlook might improve this year. Wall Street also was disappointed in Digital Equipment, where overhead and research costs have been rising faster than revenue, but the company's president says that &quot;business overall is firm.&quot; Personal computers were the industry's brightest spot: Apple Computer's profit doubled and Compaq Computer's tripled. Some big computer makers, including Honeywell and Unisys, expect more good news in 1988.

Although industry officials and analysts don't expect a return to the boom times of the early 1980s, many predict further gains in profitability this year. The run-up in natural-gas prices could further strengthen drilling activity, particularly offshore. However, on-shore remains dormant, and if oil prices plunge below $15 a barrel and stay there for a while, the losses will return. Settlement of litigation with Smith International lifted Baker Hughes's net income, but the company would have been in the black without that gain. Schlumberger's latest quarter included a $222 million gain from a tax settlement; a year earlier, it had a $312 million loss from discontinued operations and $1.74 billion of write-offs. McDermott International collected about $130 million from tax settlements.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    6 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Baker-Hughes              33,070   -    7,701     ...

Although crude prices began tumbling late in the year, the 1987 average climbed sharply from the depressed 1986 levels. In addition, increased natural-gas sales aided earnings. However, the whole group was thrown into the red by Texaco's stunning loss, which stemmed from $4.9 billion of charges and write-downs related to its $3 billion settlement with Pennzoil and its efforts to restructure and emerge from bankruptcy-court protection. Without the charges, Texaco would have had an operating profit of $159 million. Other exceptions to the strong earnings growth were Tenneco, which had huge charges from the settlement of natural-gas purchase contracts and from asset sales, and Amerada Hess, which recorded inventory write-downs. Unocal reported a fourth-quarter drop; a year earlier, the company had large gains from asset sales. USX's energy units kept it in the red. And although Chevron swung into the black, Chairman George Keller says, &quot;We recognize that our operating earnings have not yet reached desired levels.&quot; But almost across the board, integrated companies' chemical earnings surged as domestic demand remained strong and the weak dollar spurred petrochemical exports. For the current quarter, analysts expect a strong oil-industry showing as long as crude prices stay above $15 a barrel, and many major companies believe that crude prices will average about $18 for the year.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    20 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Amerada Hess            - 79,568       78,063     ...

RAILROADS   Earnings soared, partly because a pretax restructuring charge of $914 million had caused a big year-earlier deficit at Santa Fe Southern Pacific. Rail operating results were strengthened by cost-cutting. In addition, shipments of major commodities grew, with metallic ore up 36%, coal up 15% and grain up 5.6%. Autos rose 3.4%. But CNW's net was reduced partly by a $15 million pretax charge from settlement of a lawsuit. CNW says it also faced fierce competition from low-cost regional railroads. Excluding year-earlier tax credits, Consolidated Rail says its earnings from operations rose 19%, reflecting tight cost controls. Railroads say they expect operating results to advance again in the first quarter as their industrial customers continue to revive, competition from trucks eases and rail freight rates improve.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    8 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Burlington Nrthn          98,527       76,342   +  29    CNW Corp                   2,314       16,703   -  86    Consolidated Rail         79,000      119,000   -  34    CSX Corp                 129,000      132,000   -   2    Norfolk Southern         173,700      144,200   +  20    Santa Fe S Pac           113,700     -261,800     ...

Early Christmas markdowns and sluggish sales resulted in flat pretax earnings for many companies, analysts say, but lower tax rates will allow many to post higher net income anyway. Wal-Mart is expected to show the biggest fourth-quarter improvement -- a 34% increase, according to Mr. Loeb -- but profits at Limited and other specialty retailers are likely to decline. Zayre, which said its discount-store division had a fourth-quarter loss because of markdowns and disappointing sales, is also seen posting lower earnings. Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities says Federated's pretax profit will decline, but its net income will rise a bit. Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch sees higher earnings at K mart, May and Dayton Hudson, and Woolworth's profit is also expected to rise. The merchandise group of Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, posted a 16% increase in net income even though pretax profit fell 4%. Last Thursday, Penney reported a 10% profit gain for its Jan. 30 quarter, and Carter Hawley Hale returned to the black; in the table below, however, the figures for these and the other companies, except Sears, are for the October quarter.

Firms incurred losses from trading for their own accounts and from customer bad debts. With the crash scaring individual and corporate investors away from the market, the industry's revenue plunged in November and December while costs remained high. Special charges also hit many firms, although a few posted special gains. American Express took a $350 million charge to expand its reserves for Third World loan losses. Merrill Lynch posted a $47.4 million charge for severance and other costs related to staff cutbacks. By contrast, First Boston averted a loss by posting an $80 million pretax gain on the sale of its interest in its headquarters building. The first quarter should be a bit better, but analysts see it off sharply from a year ago, with investors still skittish and brokerage revenue weak. Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Securities sees the industry's pretax earnings at $350 million to $400 million, down from $2 billion in the 1987 first quarter.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr     %    7 Firms                    1987         1986     Chg -    American Express        -104,000      282,000    ...

Colgate-Palmolive Chairman Reuben Mark says the fourth quarter also was bolstered by strong gains in unit volume; he especially cites new products such as Fab One Shot and Palmolive liquid dishwasher detergent. Procter andamp; Gamble attributed its profit surge to lower taxes; analysts also noted sizable gains in unit volume. Gillette swung into the black; its year-earlier loss was due to a huge restructuring charge. Avon's 3% profit rise came from a $121 million gain from selling its 40% stake in a Japanese beauty business. Avon also had an $88 million loss from discontinued operations and sale of its home health-care business.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    4 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Avon Products             72,300       70,200   +   3    Colgate-Palmolive         38,387       29,983   +  28    Gillette Co               58,300     -124,300     ...

Quotas on foreign steel, a weak dollar and a resurgent capital-goods sector helped the industry push through hefty price increases. Moreover, the yearlong recovery doesn't seem likely to stall any time soon. Prices continue to surge, and many mills say government quotas on slab -- semifinished steel -- ensure continued shortages. Perhaps the best indicator of the once-moribund industry's robust climate was its profit per ton of steel shipped minus one-time items. USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker, posted a pretax profit of about $36 per ton shipped -- one of its most profitable quarters since the 1960s. However, nonrecurring items continued to skew results at many companies. Armco's lower net included $148 million in charges and $120 million in gains. Adjusting for one-time items, including a big investment tax rebate, Bethlehem would have earned a less-impressive $28 million. Inland, posting its best quarter since 1978, had a $51 million gain from a legal settlement, a $24 million tax-loss carry-forward and a $23 million charge to close steel facilities. LTV and Wheeling-Pittsburgh, both reorganizing under bankruptcy-law protection, continued to enjoy substantial deferred pension and debt expense. Wheeling's loss included charges of $150 million for an accounting adjustment and $47 million to restructure operations. Both companies' year-ago losses included hefty charges.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    9 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Armco Inc                  3,100       34,600   -  91    Bethlehem Steel           71,500       34,200   + 109    Inland Steel              59,469       30,216   +  97    Laclede Steel              4,841        1,575   + 207    LTV Corp                 140,600     -470,100     ...

The outlook for most companies, especially American Telephone andamp; Telegraph and the Baby Bells, depends on whether the Federal Communications Commission adopts regulatory changes enabling them to increase profits. Several companies reported nonrecurring items in either the latest or year-earlier quarter. Pacific Telesis's net was depressed mostly by charges of $118 million for early retirements and of $44 million for restructuring. In contrast, Centel's earnings surged, partly because of a $14.5 million gain from sale of an investment. For the year, ATandamp;T posted its best earnings since shedding the Bell concerns four years ago; higher growth in long-distance telephone calls helped ATandamp;T because it has the best economies of scale of any national long-distance company. Cost-cutting at ATandamp;T's unregulated businesses, many of which have posted huge losses in the past, also helped the bottom line. Analysts remain concerned, however, about ATandamp;T's ability to increase revenue.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    13 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    American Info Tech       322,200      277,400   +  16    American Tel andamp; Tel       498,000   -1,170,000     ...

Springs Industries says lower operating rates and high cotton prices kept its fourth-quarter profit growth to 4%. &quot;Our unfilled order position is quite strong in all the major segments of our business, and we expect a good current quarter,&quot; says Walter Y. Elisha, the chief executive. West Point-Pepperell's 22% increase in its Dec. 26 first quarter was aided by a $5.1 million onetime gain on the sale of its carpet division.

Deposit rates fell after the stock-market crash but still were buoyed by price wars in some markets. In addition, the group's results were depressed by a huge loss at Financial Corp. of America, parent of deeply troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's second-largest thrift. The loss was caused largely by a $236 million addition to reserves for losses on loans and real estate. Smaller charges also depressed results at other thrifts. The largest was at First Federal of Michigan, which took pretax restructuring charges totaling $41.3 million. But CityFed swung into the black; its year-earlier loss was caused by a $54.9 million pretax charge stemming from mortgage prepayments. Allan G. Bortel, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, expects thrifts' first-quarter earnings to trail year-earlier levels even though the squeeze between loan yields and deposit costs has stabilized. He cites accounting changes that will spread loan-fee income over longer periods, a lack of gains from sales of loans and mortgage-backed securities, and slower portfolio growth. -                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    10 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    AhmansonHFandamp;Co             45,180       80,294   -  44    CityFed Financial            435      - 9,997     ...

TIRES AND RUBBER   Tire makers benefited from the weak dollar, increased operating rates, better-than-expected demand for replacement tires and price increases. Special items also strongly affected net income. Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber's profit included a $9.6 million net gain from sale of real estate; a year earlier, the company had net restructuring charges of $175.8 million. Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber reported a $10 million taxloss carry-forward and an $18 million pretax restructuring charge for the fiscal fourth quarter; that compared with an $89 million restructuring charge a year earlier. In the current quarter, the industry's profit gains won't be as robust as those a year ago. However, slackening tire shipments to auto makers are expected to be partially offset by a slight increase in demand for replacement tires as people keep vehicles longer, says Harry W. Millis, a McDonald andamp; Co. analyst.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    3 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg    Firestone Tire andamp; R        29,000     - 36,000     ...

TOBACCO   &quot;Tobacco companies have built-in earnings control because cigarette prices are moving up more quickly than costs,&quot; says Emanuel Goldman of Montgomery Securities. The companies also benefited in 1987 from a lower corporate tax rate and strong sales overseas, particularly in Japan. Domestic cigarette unit sales dropped about 2%, and a similar decline is expected this year. &quot;But the tobacco companies will continue to set new {profit} records in 1988,&quot; says John Maxwell, a Wheat First Securities analyst.                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    3 Firms                    1987         1986      Chg -    American Brands          156,129      117,356   +  33    Philip Morris            478,000      371,000   +  29    RJR Nabisco              370,000      314,000   +  18    TOTAL                  1,004,129      802,356   +  25   UTILITIES                             4th Qtr      4th Qtr      %    41 Firms                   1987         1986      Chg    Allegheny Power           46,378       49,042   -   5    Amer Elect Power         502,460      507,171   -   1    Baltimore G andamp; El          48,707       47,993   +   1    Carolina P andamp; L            65,631       73,715   -  11    Centerior Energy          61,853       92,432   -  33    Central andamp; So West         75,017       77,329   -   3    CMS Energy                68,723       25,997   + 164    Columbia Gas Sys          36,285       29,947   +  21    Commonwealth Ed          181,712      212,735   -  15    Consol Edison NY          61,107      112,176   -  46    Consol Nat Gas            69,215       55,478   +  25    Detroit Edison           106,804      111,306   -   4    Dominion Resources        84,300       93,800   -  10    Duke Power                92,740       92,077   +   1    Enron Corp                 7,000        3,800   +  84    Enserch Corp               6,967       11,424   -  39    FPL Group                 71,468       61,289   +  17    Genl Public Util          48,207       45,807   +   5    Gulf States Util          48,207       24,135   + 100    Illinois Power            40,623       68,059   -  40    Middle So Util            50,613       61,827   -  18    Niagara Mohawk        -   32,649       84,698     ...
