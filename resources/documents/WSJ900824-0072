West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann saidyesterday that 25 West German firms were under investigationfor criminal offenses involving the export of weapons andweapons-related technology to Baghdad. Ministry officialsalso confirmed that as many as 34 other companies aresuspected of less serious export violations involving Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Haussmann said in a statement he plans to tightenexport-control laws sharply and urged West German businesses&quot;to be especially careful&quot; in their dealings with sensitiveexports. Meanwhile, the West Germans appear to be crackingdown on some of the most serious violators. Last Friday,authorities arrested seven people suspected of supplying Iraqwith equipment needed to make chemical weapons.   The arrests and Mr. Haussmann's statements, which didn'tmention any individual or company names or even specify theillegal exports, come at a sensitive moment for the WestGerman government. The U.S. is pressuring Bonn to take a moreactive role in international military operations aimed atcontaining Iraq. But the West Germans insist their Basic Lawprohibits them from sending troops outside the region of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. West German officialshave said they're considering changing their Basic Law, butthat could prove difficult.   If the West Germans insist on staying away from theconfrontation, they could face particularly heavy criticismamong their allies for earlier exports that helped Iraq buildup its arsenal. While many countries, including France andthe Soviet Union, supplied weapons to Iraq, German firms arethought to have spearheaded the development of Baghdad'schemical-weapons and munitions industries.   The main question is why Bonn waited so long to takeaction. Even Mr. Haussmann concedes that most of thedeliveries occurred &quot;long ago&quot; and only came to his attentionas a result of the Middle East crisis. The first flurry ofconcern about questionable West German exports can be tracedto 1988, when Iraq unleashed poison gas on theIranian-occupied town of Halabja, where, some analystsbelieve, 5,000 Kurdish civilians died.   West German law bans the sale of any weapons to an area ofconflict, which included Iraq throughout the 1980s. But muchof what was sold falls into a category of goods that isdifficult to control: technology and equipment that havelegitimate commercial uses but that can also be used toproduce weapons. Chemical weapons plants, for instance, aresimilar to those used to make pesticides and herbicides. WestGermany began requiring export licenses for such dual-useequipment only in 1984, and enforcement has been spotty.   Economics Ministry officials say they have tightenedexport controls since early 1989, though they concede someimportant regulations are still waiting approval by the WestGerman parliament. Those measures came in the wake of ascandal in which West German firms helped Libya develop achemical-weapons plant.   West German officials say they plan to expand thepenalties for those caught circumventing export regulations.In the wake of the Libyan scandal, West Germany increased themaximum penalty for those caught selling nuclear or chemicalweapons technology to 10 years from three. Mr. Haussmann nowsays he wants to increase the maximum to 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
