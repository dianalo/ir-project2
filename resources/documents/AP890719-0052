The attack occurred Tuesday night at the end of a weeklongreligious festival in Kataragama, 105 miles southeast of Colombo,said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity.   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.   About 5,000 people had gathered for the procession, whichattracts both Sinhalese Buddhists and Tamil Hindus and is considereda demonstration that the two communities can come together inharmony despite the country's ethnic strife. Tamil Hindus from Indiaalso were present.   ``It is a tragedy beyond comparison,'' said Ranjith MadummaBandara, a government lawmaker who participated in the procession.``There is nothing sacred in this country any more.''   Bandara said two women walking beside him were killed in theexplosions but that he escaped injury.   The Sri Lankan government imposed press censorship July 6 amidescalating ethnic violence and a political dispute with India overthe withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping forces from the small islandnation southeast of Madras.   In Madras, India, a Sri Lankan Tamil party blamed the attack onSinhalese militants from the left-wing People's Liberation Front.   Ponnudurai Ravinesan, spokesman for the Eelam People'sRevolutionary Liberation Front, said he had information from SriLanka that the grenades were thrown by radicals from the Sinhalesegroup.   The front has usually attacked only fellow Sinhalese sincelaunching an uprising against the government in 1987. It has accusedthe Sinhalese-dominated government of selling out its own people tomake peace with Tamil rebels.   Bandara said Dharamadasa Banda, minister of state forrehabilitation, and other Parliament members were walking with theprocession from a Hindu temple to a Buddhist dagoba when threegrenades were hurled. Banda, a Sinhalese Buddhist who is thereligious chief for the two shrines, was among those injured,Bandara said.   The two shrines, which are about a half-mile apart, are locatedin the predominantly Sinhalese district of Monaragala. The largelyTamil district of Amparai borders Monaragala to its north.   Tamil guerrillas embarked on a separatist war in 1983, targetingthe predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lankan security forces and Sinhalesecivilians.   In 1987, India attempted to mediate peace on the island of 16million people by signing an accord with the Sri Lankan governmentthat was designed to give Tamils in northern and eastern Sri Lankasome autonomy.   Indian troops were dispatched to the island to supervise asurrender of arms by Tamil guerrillas, but the most militant Tamilsreneged on the pact and began battling the Indians.   The Sri Lankan government this summer opened negotiations withTamil militants, and President Ranasinghe Premadasa subsequentlydemanded that India withdraw its estimated 40,000 soldiers by theend of July.   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India has said a premature pulloutwould lead to even more bloodshed.   Since 1983, about 14,000 people have died in the ethnic strife.The government blames the Sinhalese extremists for about 3,500 ofthe killings. The others, including nearly 1,000 Indian soldiers,died in the Tamil insurrection.   Sinhalese comprise about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's people. Tamilsmake up 18 percent and say they are discriminated against bySinhalese in education, jobs and use of the Sinhala language.   There also are small Moslem and Christian communities.</TEXT></DOC>
