Ronald M. Davis, director of the federal Office of Smoking andHealth, said Sunday that a report calling tobacco an addictive drugwill be issued by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in the next fewweeks. Davis said such a declaration means tobacco should receivethe serious attention given to heroin and cocaine.   ``If Ronald Davis yesterday was really speaking accurately forand with the authorization from the surgeon general in describinghis forthcoming report, it is apparent that anti-tobacco zeal hasovertaken common sense and good judgment,'' Merryman said.   ``It may well be that utter frustration on the part of thesurgeon general, because of lack of progress toward his goal oftobacco prohibition, is responsible for this incredible comparisonof tobacco use with heroin and cocaine addiction,'' said Merryman.   The Office of Smoking and Health, although not directly underKoop in the Department of Health and Human Services organizationalstructure, is among several federal agencies working at Koop'sdirection in developing material for the annual smoking report.   There was no question Davis is familiar with the contents of thereport, but department officials expressed surprise Monday that hediscussed them in advance of the formal release, tentativelyscheduled May 16.   Public Health Service spokesman Jim Brown said Koop will notdiscuss the report in advance of its release.   Davis made his remarks Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation''program.</TEXT></DOC>
