Its editors gathered in jubilation to watch the press run at thestate printing house, which is normally used to put out theCommunist Party and government dailies.   Editor-in-chief Adam Michnik smiled broadly as he scrutinizedthe first issues of Gazeta Wyborcza, or The Election Newspaper.   Deputy editor Helena Luczywo obliged ink-covered printers wholined up and asked her to autograph copies of the paper.   ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``I can't believe it.''   The newspaper obtained offices less than a week ago. A lack oftelephones in the office and the scarcity of newsprint in Polandhad left Monday's publication up in the air as late as Sundaymorning.   Communist authorities agreed to allow the opposition to publishits own daily newspaper during talks that ended April 5.   The government also agreed to legalize the Solidarityindependent trade union movement in return for the opposition'sparticipation in Poland's first partially democratic parliamentaryelections.   The first issue of Gazeta Wyborcza featured a front-page pictureof Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa with a quotation in large type:``For it to be different and better, we must win these elections.''   The newspaper will publicize the opposition's campaign until theelection on June 4 and then plans to continue as a daily with anopposition editorial viewpoint.   The first run was 150,000 copies of an eight-page, five-columnnewspaper. The editors hope to circulate 500,000 copies by the endof the week.   Only the first and last pages carried news. The inside pagescontained short biographies for all 261 Solidarity-backedcandidates running for the National Assembly.   A front-page note explained the newspaper's aims, saying,``Here, after more than 40 years (of Communist rule), is a normal,mass-printed independent daily, the first in Poland and probablythe whole (Soviet) bloc.   In a probable first for a legally published newspaper here,Gazeta Wyborcza instructed readers to tune in to U.S.-financedRadio Free Europe to hear interviews with Solidarity-backedcandidates.   The newsstand price was high by Polish standards, about 8 cents,because there was not enough paper to include ads, the editors said.</TEXT></DOC>
