This landloss affects everything from wildlife, fisheries, and recreation to theeconomy and culture. A part of this loss results from natural, unmanageablefactors, but manageable factors are also responsible. This report discussesone of the manageable factors: canals and their dredged-material levees.In coastal Louisiana wetlands, canals are constructed primarily to facilitatenavigation and oil and gas recovery. The density of canals in this regionis now about equal to the natural network of bayous and creeks. The primaryeffect of these canals and associated levees is to alter the processof flooding and drainage. The influence of canals and their levees oncoastal Louisiana erosion rates are modified by local geologic, hydrologic,and biologic interactions. The empirical relationship between canalsand erosion is, however, clear; land loss is directly related to canaldensity. Comparisons with mosquito ditches, which are smaller analoguesof canals, reveal similar patterns of wetland changes and suggest managementoptions.</TEXT></DOC>
