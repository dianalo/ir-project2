The United States already provides some military training oflocal forces in Bolivia, but not to Peru or Colombia.   President Bush, in campaign speeches, called for stepped upactions against drugs at their South American origins. But suchattempts have been largely unsuccessful because of guerrilla wars,economic problems and a lack of resources.   The administration official stressed that the proposal calls formore training of troops, not for actual military operations byAmerican forces. Also, the local governments would have to requestthe presence of U.S. armed forces overseas.   ``There's nothing unilateral contemplated,'' the source said.   The proposal is in a classified section of the drug strategydrafted by national drug policy director William J. Bennett. TheNational Security Council is reviewing all international andinterdiction proposals. President Bush is scheduled to present thefinal package to Congress on Sept. 5.   Although some aspects of Bennett's proposed strategy havetriggered some bickering between agencies, a source said there hasbeen ``no opposition to expanding training'' by the military.   Special Forces troops currently train forces in Bolivia, and asource said the expansion contemplated would be ``building on thenumber of people we have down there.''   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House SelectCommittee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, cautioned that``increased military involvement in Latin American anti-drugefforts must be treated extremely carefully. Any U.S. militaryinvolvement must be through multilateral efforts such as theOrganization of American States or the United Nations, and must bewelcomed by the country involved.''   The proposal was derided by Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., chairmanof the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Task Force onInternational Narcotics, who said ``$300 million for countries thatare very beleaguered, whose economies are in a shambles, that's aspit in the ocean. That's tokenism, that's what it is.''   Giving those countries more aid would work ``only if they arecapable of utilizing it,'' Smith said in an interview Friday fromhis Florida office. ``... Most of these countries have not had theability to digest more aid. They don't have the troops. They don'thave the expertise.''   The commitment of U.S. military advisers, equipment and economicaid should be dependent on the recipient countries committing theirown military forces to the anti-drug effort, something they havedone only on rare occasions, he said.   ``I'll be happy to give all that to them if they'll tell methey'll let the military loose to get involved in eradication,''Smith said.   Rangel took a somewhat different position, saying, ``Merelyincreasing anti-narcotics assistance without development of acomprehensive plan that addresses the economic and social needs ofdrug-producing countries will not succeed.   ``In addition to crop eradication, we must improve assistancefor law enforcement, make provisions for income alternatives forillicit narcotics crop cultivation, and consider whether debt andtrade incentives are needed as part of an effective anti-narcoticsstrategy,'' Rangel said.   Capitol Hill's lack of access to copies of Bennett's proposedstrategy has prompted some displeasure among members of Congress,particularly those who are actively involved in drug issues. BothRangel and Smith said they based their comments on news reports ofwhat the strategy proposes.   The draft strategy was distributed to a select few officials ineach of the federal agencies involved in anti-drug efforts, andthey were directed to keep it confidential.   Rangel and Smith said they and other chairmen of congressionalcommittees concerned with drug matters met with Bennett last week.   ``He asked Congress not to take seriously all the storiesappearing in the press about the contents of the proposedstrategy,'' Rangel said in a statement. ``He told us he ispresently `bouncing ideas' off the American people. He asked us toreserve comment until the report is approved by the president andreleased.''   Among other things, Rangel said the strategy will be meaningfulonly if the president calls for full funding of its proposals.   ``The strategy will be pure rhetoric and will become a brokenadministration promise if real dollars, not just the words in thisplan, are not provided,'' he said. ``You can't say you're going todeclare war and provide no money for the bullets.''</TEXT></DOC>
