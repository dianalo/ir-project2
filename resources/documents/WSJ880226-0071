Mr. Patrick called the reporting requirement &quot;the first step&quot; toward possible regulatory action.    On a separate trade issue, meanwhile, an interagency panel voted unanimously to recommend an investigation into whether Japan discriminates against foreign construction companies.    The vote by the Trade Policy Review Group reflected the Reagan administration's disappointment with Japan's failure thus far to fulfill Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's promise to open up Japanese public-works projects to U.S. companies. The last U.S. attempt to obtain more-specific commitments ended inconclusively in Tokyo last week, and no further meetings are scheduled.    If the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council endorses the panel's recommendation, President Reagan is almost certain to start an inquiry that could lead to trade sanctions against Japan if the existence of discriminatory practices is confirmed. However, sources close to Japanese construction companies called yesterday's action a &quot;negotiating tactic&quot; and expressed hopes that talks would resume.    Japan has offered to allow U.S. companies to bid for small portions of six projects, including new airports in Tokyo Bay and Hiroshima. But U.S. negotiators complain that the offer wouldn't open the way for U.S. concerns to land high-value work, such as airport terminals and hangars.    In the FCC's order, the commission stopped far short of imposing sanctions against companies whose home countries are found to discriminate against U.S. telecommunications companies. The agency has been considering such a move since November 1986, but yesterday said it still hadn't made up its mind and didn't set any deadline for doing so.    But simply requiring phone companies to report purchases could frighten them from buying foreign-made goods, a Commerce Department telecommunications official said. &quot;How would you like it if every time you bought a Sony television, you had to send in a post card, underlined in red, to the government?&quot; the official said.    Phone companies are especially sensitive to government pressure, the official added, because they have a host of requests for regulatory relief before various government agencies.    The FCC's concern with international trade started in late 1986, when former FCC Chairman Mark Fowler vowed to retaliate against West Germany's Siemens AG if Bonn succeeded in blocking American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. from buying a state-owned French company. The French government eventually finessed that controversy by selling the company, Cie. Generale des Constructions Telephoniques, to Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, of Sweden.    But the FCC has continued pressing its concern that foreign countries discriminate against U.S. telecommunications companies, while this country is open to foreigners. A spokeswoman for the European Community said the EC has tried to persuade the FCC against &quot;discriminating&quot; between foreign and U.S. companies.    The FCC order required long-distance companies with annual revenue greater than $100 million, and large local telephone companies, including the regional Bell telephone companies and GTE Corp., to report annually on purchases of large telephone-switching and transmission equipment. Telephone switches are the most expensive part of a telephone network, and ATandamp;T faces fierce competition in the market from a host of foreign competitors. The FCC said it would get information on U.S. sales of other telephone equipment through U.S. trade agencies.    In addition, the FCC required foreign-owned companies that offer long-distance telephone service within the U.S. to report their revenue on a quarterly basis. A spokesman for Cable andamp; Wireless Communications Inc., the U.S. long-distance unit of Britain's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC, said the company wasn't concerned with the provision. &quot;The FCC's emphasis is clearly on equipment, not services,&quot; he said.    But the FCC signaled that it would look at services as well. The agency said the U.S. had what amounts to a trade deficit of $1.2 billion in international telephone calls in 1986, and it blamed high charges by foreign phone companies for the gap. &quot;When a call goes from the U.S. to a foreign country, the amount paid to the country can be as much as 50% or 80% of what the U.S. carriers collect,&quot; said Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common-carrier bureau.    Among comments by Bell regionals, Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. called the reporting requirements &quot;onerous,&quot; while Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. said the FCC policy would ultimately constrain the Bell companies by forcing them to buy equipment only from domestic suppliers. The major supplier domestically is ATandamp;T, which also is the Bells' biggest rival.    ATandamp;T didn't have any immediate comment, but said its comments a year ago supported FCC efforts to gather information about unfair trade practices. But ATandamp;T also said then it didn't believe the FCC should impose sanctions or reporting requirements.    M. Peter Thomas, the U.S. executive in charge of Stockholm-based L.M. Ericsson's North American business, said, &quot;Is the FCC really suggesting that the Bells buy equipment only from ATandamp;T?&quot;    Separately, the FCC said it will extend for one year, through 1989, the rate of return allowed ATandamp;T and the regional Bell companies on interstate calls. Under current regulations, ATandamp;T is entitled to earn 12.2% on its interstate telephone business; the Bell companies can earn 12% on the interstate portion of calls they handle. The FCC now is deciding whether to scrap regulation of these companies' profit margins, and regulate their phone rates instead. </TEXT></DOC>
