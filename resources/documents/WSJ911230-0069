The Japanese complain about that.</LP><TEXT>   The 21 business-people going along on the trip, whichbegins today, include 12 chief executives of major U.S.corporations, ranging from the Big Three auto makers toAmerican Express -- and their presence is likely to focus newattention on longstanding Japanese concerns about the pay oftop U.S. executives.   The combined annual compensation of the dozen CEOs lastyear was $25 million, or an average of more than $2 millioneach. By comparison, Japanese chief executives are paid$300,000 to $400,000 a year on average -- around one-sixththe average received by the dozen in President Bush'sentourage. Moreover, Japanese managers pay a sharply highertax rate.   Unfortunately for President Bush, this huge disparitymeans some extra political baggage when he and the CEOsarrive in Tokyo Jan. 7 after stops in other Asian nations.The U.S. delegation will be complaining about unfaircompetition. But to Japanese officials, big American CEOpaychecks at a time of mounting layoffs and losses havecreated a corporate culture out of touch with the economy.   In Japan, top managers are expected to take voluntary paycuts when a company gets into trouble -- and governmentofficials pointedly mention how rarely that happens in theU.S. &quot;In Japan, you'd cut executive pay before eliminatingjobs,&quot; one Finance Ministry official says simply.   Japanese government officials first made an issue of U.S.executive compensation last May, during the so-calledStructural Impediments Initiative talks aimed at loweringmajor trade barriers in both countries. The Japanese arguedthat overpaid American executives were preoccupied withshort-term results, worsening U.S. internationalcompetitiveness. Executive pay that's many times higher thanthat of other company employees &quot;not only has a verydetrimental or counterproductive effect on the morale ofemployees, but also affects the savings of the corporatesector,&quot; Makoto Utsumi, then vice minister of finance forinternational affairs, said at the time. &quot;The U.S. shoulddecide whether that is productive.&quot;   Koichi Hori, representative director for the BostonConsulting Group in Tokyo, says U.S. executives should make athird or a quarter of what they earn now. &quot;There's no logicwhatsoever {for an executive to be} paid 100 times more thana secretary,&quot; he says. &quot;All workers add value to thecorporation.&quot;   President Bush doesn't seem overly bothered by the paycontroversy. &quot;It's good that these businesspeople are goingalong,&quot; he said at a news conference on the eve of hisdeparture. He defended his entourage, &quot;regardless of whattheir salaries are.&quot;   Even before the Asia trip was in the planning stages,Graef Crystal, a compensation expert in the U.S., was callingattention to the wide pay disparity. In his recent book, &quot;InSearch of Excess,&quot; Mr. Crystal says that many American CEOsare grossly overpaid, earning 160 times more than the averageemployee; in Japan, by contrast, CEOs earn only 16 times morethan the average worker. (Other compensation specialistsconfirm Mr. Crystal's estimates, give or take a few points).   Worse, Mr. Crystal argues, American CEOs get paid hugelyin good years and, &quot;if not hugely, then merely wonderfully inbad years.&quot; All this undercuts U.S. complaints about the $41billion annual trade deficit with Japan.   That's especially true of the automotive contingentaccompanying the president. Three-fourths of the U.S.-Japantrade deficit involves autos and auto parts. But amid the BigThree's cries of pain, the Japanese don't understand why U.S.businesses richly reward their top executives even in hardtimes.   The $1.2 million annual pension that General Motors Corp.gave its former chairman, Roger Smith, for example, is farmore than most working auto executives earn in Japan. Mr.Smith's successor, Robert Stempel, received $2.18 million indirect and deferred compensation last year -- and now ispresiding over the downsizing of GM to a shadow of its formerself, with 21 plants and 74,000 jobs to be wiped out withinthree years. &quot;In Japan, somebody like Mr. Stempel would haveannounced his resignation by now,&quot; says Peter Drucker, theauthor and management guru. Efforts to reach Mr. Stempel forcomment were unsuccessful.   Although the Big Three have eliminated many bonuses,Detroit's executive pay levels still seem profligate to manyJapanese. While lax Japanese disclosure rules don't requireCEOs to make their salaries public, there are some broaderlistings. Honda Motor Co. paid its top three dozen officers atotal of just 1.29 billion yen (about $10.2 million) lastyear. With Japan's 65% top marginal tax rate for income above20 million yen, most of the company's highest-echelonexecutives probably brought home less than $150,000. NissanMotor Co. paid its top 48 officers even less, on average.Toyota doesn't publish comprehensive compensation data.   The disparities are even starker for the best-paid U.S.CEOs, and on President Bush's trip the undisputed leader isChrysler Corp.'s Lee Iacocca. Long a lightning rod forJapanese criticism about pay, Mr. Iacocca is a vocal criticof Japan and has called for ceilings of Japanese autoexports. In addition to his direct compensation, whichtotaled $4.65 million last year, he is getting 62,500 sharesof Chrysler stock per quarter (value: about $718,000) to stayon the job past year's end.   Despite heavy losses and layoffs at his company,Chrysler's 1991 proxy statement disclosed that the companypurchased two of Mr. Iacocca's homes (in Boca Raton, Fla.,and suburban Detroit) because he couldn't sell them for theprices he wanted. In a recent appearance on CNN's &quot;Larry KingLive&quot; TV program, Mr. Iacocca conceded that he was being paidlike a .350 hitter when he was &quot;about a .215&quot; hitter the pasttwo years.   Mr. Hori, of the Boston Consulting Group in Tokyo,complains that President Bush is hurting his cause bybringing along Mr. Iacocca. &quot;Iacocca shouts and shoutswithout any logic and is collecting huge amounts of money atthe same time,&quot; Mr. Hori says. &quot;It irritates the Japanesepublic.&quot;   But Mr. Iacocca appears ready for the fight. &quot;This is aquestion he's been confronted by many times, and he'sprepared to answer,&quot; says Steve Harris, an Iacocca spokesman.&quot;He has a great many other questions for the Japanese thatthey'll be answering as well.&quot;   Ford Motor Co.'s Harold Poling, with $1.29 million indirect total compensation last year, is also in the Bushentourage. Gene Koch, a Ford spokesman, says the subject ofMr. Poling's pay &quot;has not come up except in cocktailparty-type conversations. All of those things are pretty muchlooked upon as a personal thing between the individual andthe company.&quot;   But that hasn't prevented executive pay from becoming athorny political issue in the U.S. The Democrats have alreadyseized on it as an example of Republican economic injustice.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo blasted the president's trip toJapan with auto executives as &quot;a truly dumb idea&quot; during anews conference at which he said he won't enter thepresidential race. Mr. Cuomo summarized the message thatAmerican executives were bearing to Tokyo as follows: &quot;Hey,look, I only made $20 million last year. You have to stopfooling around with this competition because I want to makemore.&quot; Mr. Cuomo said the president should be speaking forlaid-off workers and the poor, not for rich CEOs.   And in an economic-policy address last month, ArkansasGov. Bill Clinton, a presidential aspirant, also lambastedPresident Bush for allowing &quot;self-serving CEOs&quot; to &quot;build aneconomy out of paper and perks instead of people andproducts.&quot;   Perhaps sensing the recession-weary administration'svulnerability on the issue, Vice President Dan Quayle hasjoined the chorus of CEO-bashers. During a luncheon interviewwith reporters last month, he criticized &quot;some of theseexorbitant salaries paid to corporate executives unrelated toproductivity.&quot; He said he might have the White HouseCompetitiveness Council, which he heads, take up the issue.   The companies represented on Mr. Bush's U.S. trip defendtheir bosses' big pay on the grounds of standard practice.They say CEOs of corporate giants have immenseresponsibilities, which increase further in troubled times.Says a spokesman for New York's American International Group,whose chief executive, Maurice Greenberg, received $1.75million in salary last year: &quot;His compensation is pretty muchin line with his position and the company and his performanceand success.&quot; If anything, Mr. Greenberg, who has greatlyimproved the company's performance, is underpaid, thespokesman adds.   The high-earning delegation also includes C.J. Silas,chief executive of Phillips Petroleum, whose directcompensation last year topped $4 million; American Express'sJames D. Robinson III, whose pay package approached $3.5million; Textron Chief Executive B.F. Dolan, who earned $2.59million; Dexter Baker, chairman of Air Products andamp; Chemicals,who got $1.09 million; and TRW's chairman, Joseph Gorman,whose direct compensation fell 3%, to $1.06 million. Theentourage also includes a number of retired CEOs, who stillearn princely sums as board members; a few less-seniorexecutives, and officials representing private companies.   Japan's executives get lower pay partly because corporatedirectors tend to be insiders with an interest in keeping paygaps modest. Not so in the U.S., where CEOs sit on eachother's boards and are sometimes seen by critics as shovelingshareholders' money into each other's pockets.   &quot;In the U.S., the only limits are the gall of the CEO,&quot;says Ralph Whitworth, president of the Washington-basedUnited Shareholders Association. Founded by corporate raiderT. Boone Pickens in 1986, the group has pressured somecompanies into changing their compensation systems to reflectCEO and company performance.   To be sure, not everyone thinks that U.S. corporationsshould emulate Japan when it comes to compensation. Low payin Japan fosters expensive gift-giving and lavish expenseaccounts. Some Japanese executives have even succumbed totaking kickbacks from suppliers and accepting sweetheartstock deals.   Almost everyone agrees that the differing compensationstandards reflect cultural differences, too. Under theJapanese sense of social harmony, it was &quot;never deemed seemlythat individuals could get so much more, on a team basis,than other individuals,&quot; says Gerald Williams, generalmanager of the Tokyo office of Towers Perrin, apersonnel-consulting firm.   In the U.S., on the other hand, individuals go for thegold. &quot;That's why we have free enterprise,&quot; says MarkAbramson, president of Council for Excellence in Government,which advocates lowering the gap between private andgovernment pay. &quot;That's what makes this country great.&quot;   ---   Staff reporter Paul Ingrassia in Detroit contributed tothis article.</TEXT></DOC>
