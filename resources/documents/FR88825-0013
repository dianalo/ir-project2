These revisions request an extensionof the attainment date for carbon monoxide (CO) for the City of Nashuato 1990 and contain the necessary attainment plan. The plan includes localstreet improvements, a vehicle Anti-tampering/Anti-fuel Switching programand a vehicle Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program.On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 27878), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemakingproposing approval of the overall plan. On June 12, 1987 (52 FR 22503),EPA published a Supplementary Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing approvalof the rules for the I/M program in Nashua and eleven surrounding towns(Amherst, Derry, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, Londonderry, Merrimack, Pelham,Salem, and Windham).Details of the plan, the history of its development, and EPA's rationalefor proposing approval of the plan are provided in detail in EPA's August4, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Similarly, details of the I/M programand EPA's rationale for approving the I/M rules are provided in detailin EPA's June 12, 1987 notice. As no public comments were received on eithernotice, details provided in those notices will not be repeated here. Theremainder of this notice discusses information received since the proposalswere published.<ITAG tagnum="84">I/M Program Requirements</ITAG>The criteria EPA uses in evaluating the adequacy of I/M programs are discussedin detail in a policy document published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 22, 1981 (46 FR 7182). The Nashuaarea program was reviewed against these criteria and found to satisfy sevenof the ten applicable requirements. EPA proposed approval of the I/M ruleswith the understanding that New Hampshire would submit the informationon the following criteria before final rulemaking: (1) The recordkeepingand record submittal requirements; (2) the surveillance procedures; and(3) the public awareness plan.On October 15, 1987, New Hampshire submitted information on the missingelements. The New Hampshire Department of Safety (DOS), the agency responsiblefor implementing the I/M program, has agreed with EPA on what will be includedon emission inspection reports and quarterly reporting of data. We havealso agreed that criteria for targeting of surveillance inspections willinclude low failure rates, abnormal frequencies of reported test results,and complaints. For public awareness, New Hampshire will conduct an extensivepress and letter campaign, including distribution of EPA pamphlets on I/Mand emission controls to all motorists in the program area.EPA finds that this information satisfies the criteria set forth in thepolicy document referenced above. For more details on EPA's review, seethe Technical Support Document available at locations listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Local Street Improvements</ITAG>The attainment plan commits to four transportation control measures whichreduce traffic congestion around intersections with high CO levels. Thesemeasures include rerouting of traffic, road construction, parking controlsand optimization of signal timing. The December 3, 1985 submission containeddetails of these measures and a schedule showing full implementation byDecember, 1986. In the August 4, 1986 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, EPAnoted that final approval would not be published until these measures hadbeen implemented or until legal authority to implement them had been obtained.Since that time, the City of Nashua, the ARD and EPA have worked togetherto modify the details of the December 3, 1985 submission. These modifications,submitted by New Hampshire on May 12, 1987, accommodate some of the city'sother needs but still result in improvements in air quality of the samemagnitude as the original plan.EPA has reviewed the modified local street improvements and is satisfiedthat they provide the equivalent improvements in air quality as the measureswe originally proposed for approval. EPA is also satisfied that all ofthese measures have been implemented. Further details on EPA's review arealso found in the Technical Support Document referenced above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is approving the New Hampshire Carbon Monoxide State ImplementationPlan for the City of Nashua and New Hampshire's request to extend the attainmentdate to December 31, 1990. EPA is also approving the Nashua area I/M programrules and the commitment from the Governor to convert the program to computeranalyzers, if necessary.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Under 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitionsfor judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Courtof Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 24, 1988. This actionmay not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements(See section 307(b)(2)).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of New Hampshire was approved by the Director of the FederalRegister on July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
