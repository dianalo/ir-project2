Since thenumber of starts of the CHP installation should be kept low, heat storagewill be required. Three buffering methods requiring no extra investmentsare discussed: heat storage in boilers, in the heat distribution networkand in the building. The latter option is particularly interesting. 12figs., 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
