It urged Palestinians to ``declare war'' on those issuing falseleaflets, which it said were ``inspired by suspicious elementsworking in the enemy's (Israel's) intelligence.''   The statement comes amid a growing trend of violence, threatsand factional rivalry within the Arab community in the 20-month-olduprising.   At least 87 Palestinian deaths have been blamed on other Arabssince the revolt against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Armygunfire and Israeli settlers have killed 527 Palestinians.Thirty-eight Israelis also have died.   The army said Friday it is investigating the stabbing death ofan Arab man whose body was found near Kufr Zibad village, 30 milesnorthwest of Jerusalem.   Israel radio quoted residents as saying the man was suspected ofcollaborating with Israel and had been interrogated by uprisingleaders before he was slain.   The underground leadership's leaflet condemned statements issuedby 10 largely obscure groups, including the Palestinian PopularArmy.   A statement issued in the name of the Popular Army on July 16threatened Bir Zeit University Professor Sari Nusseibeh forallegedly misusing uprising funds and cooperating with Israel.   Prosecution papers filed in an Israeli case against severaluprising leaders alleged Nusseibeh was paymaster of the uprising.But the professor, a Palestine Liberation Organization supporter,never was charged.   Jamil Tarifi, a West Bank lawyer, was threatened by wall sloganssigned by the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine. The leaflet did not refer to that group, whichparticipates in the unified leadership.   Tarifi recently announced that he took part in talks withIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Several Arabs have met withShamir to discuss his peace initiative, but Tarifi is the only oneto publicly admit it.   The initiative calls for elections in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel onlimited autonomy.   Shamir on Friday again ruled out any dealings with the PLO,which Israel brands a terrorist organization but many Palestiniansconsider their sole legitimate representative.   ``We will not meet and talk with the PLO,'' Shamir told adelegation from the United Jewish Appeal. ``They are not partnersto peace. They are the very opposite of peace. Their objective isto eliminate the Jewish state and replace it with another Arabstate.''   His comments coincided with the general congress of the PLO'sdominant Fatah faction in Tunisia, where chairman Yasser Arafat isseeking support for his recent moderate stance and calls for peacewith Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
