In Virginia, a second accidentinvolving an Amtrak train left 26 people hurt.   Most of the injuries in both derailments appeared to be minor,officials said.   In a third accident in Princeton, Ind., a freight train derailedand hit tanks containing farm pesticides and fertilizers, releasingchemical fumes that forced evacuation of 1,300 students from nearbyschools for two hours, police said.   Tom Perry, a police radio operator, said the CSX Corp. trainapparently ran off the end of a rail spur and struck two trucksbehind a grain elevator and fertilizer company owned by Cargill Inc.   One woman was in satisfactory condition at Gibson GeneralHospital after being splattered with the chemicals. She sufferedirritation of the skin and eyes in the 8:30 a.m. accident,officials said.   In Lemont, Ill., the gate was down and warning signals wereactivated when the commuter train collision occurred about 7:25a.m. some 40 miles southwest of Springfield, said Will CountySheriff John Johnsen.   ``The indication is that the driver of the truck ignored thesignals and drove around the gates,'' Johnsen said. The traincarried 98 people.   The collision tore off the rear axle of the truck and itsstorage bin, carrying it down the tracks about a quarter of a mile,officials said.   The truck driver, James Krueger of Sauk Village, was listed infair condition at Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet. Three otherswere reported in fair condition at the hospital.   ``I was reading my newspaper, and all of a sudden, I just hearda loud boom,'' said passenger Jim Kaynish of Joliet. ``The lightswent out, and a couple of seconds later, it felt like we were goingthrough a bumpy field.''   None of the passengers in his car appeared to be injured,Kaynish said. People in the first car were covered ``from head totoe'' with dust from the gravel, he said. The train carried 98passengers.   Damage to equipment amounted to at least $1 million, said ChrisKnapton, a spokesman for the Metra commuter rail line in Chicago.He said one of the passenger cars was totally destroyed and theothers required repair. Damage to the locomotive would not beassessed until it could be righted, he said.   In addition, the collision ``chewed up about 750 feet of trackthat will have to be replaced,'' Knapton said. The track belongs toIllinois Central Gulf, he said.   Officials from Amtrak, which also uses the line, said trainsbetween Chicago and Springfield and Chicago and St. Louis werererouted.   In the second passenger accident, six cars and both engines ofan Amtrak train carrying 519 passengers derailed near theVirginia-North Carolina border, authorities and witnesses said.   The derailment occurred at 2:08 p.m. near Skippers, about 50miles south of Richmond, said Amtrak supervisor Sam Wilson. Thetrain was traveling from Tampa, Fla., and Miami to New York.   Six people with minor injuries were admitted to Halifax MemorialHospital in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., said spokeswoman Val Short.   Twenty people, most of them complaining of back and neck pains,were treated at Greensville Memorial Hospital in Emporia, saidspokesman Dave Magruder. One woman was transferred to the MedicalCollege of Virginia Hospitals in Richmond for treatment of a backinjury; another woman was admitted to Greensville, but Magrudersaid he didn't know the extent of her injuries.   The cause of the derailment was not known, said Clifford Black,an Amtrak spokesman in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
