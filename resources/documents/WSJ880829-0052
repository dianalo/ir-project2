The bank also said it was raising its Lombard rate by the same margin to 7.75%.    The change was the second in less than a month and followed Thursday's increase in interest rates in Europe.    The discount rate is the rate of interest used by banks to discount paper at the central bank. The Lombard rate is the rate charged on advances to banks where government securities are used as collateral.    The move followed the rise Thursday in the West German Bundesbank's discount rate to 3.5% from 3%. The Bundesbank's action was followed by other central banks in Europe, including in Italy, Switzerland and Austria.    An indication that the Belgian national bank would raise its discount rate came earlier Friday when it increased for the second time this week the interest rate on three-month treasury certificates to 7.5% from 7.35%.    The three-month rate is considered to be the most important on the Belgian money markets and often signals a change in the discount rate.    The national bank last raised its discount rate Aug. 11 by one quarter of a percentage point. </TEXT></DOC>
