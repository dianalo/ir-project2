(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A committee of gun owners filed petitionsTuesday to block Maryland's pioneering ban on sales of SaturdayNight Specials or cheap handguns and to force a public vote on thegun control bill in November.   Fred Griisser, chairman of the Maryland Committee Against theGun Ban, submitted petitions to the secretary of state that he saidcontained signatures of more than 22,000 voters opposed to the ban.   The committee will need 33,044 valid signatures by the end ofJune to force the bill to referendum, and at least one-third ofthose were due Tuesday.   Griisser challenged statements by supporters of the law that itwill only ban Saturday Night Specials that serve no useful, lawfulpurpose.   ``We feel that this bill has the potential to ban allhandguns,'' he said.   If the law survives the challenge from gun owners, it will beillegal to sell or manufacture any handguns in Maryland unless theyare approved by a nine-member review board appointed by thegovernor.   The board is directed to ban guns that are cheaply made of poorquality materials and are so inaccurate that they can't be used forsporting purposes or self defense. It also is directed to ban gunsmade of plastics or ceramics that can't be detected by metaldetectors.   It is the first state law attempting to ban the sale of SaturdayNight Specials, and Gliisser said putting it to a vote in November``is going to be a test case for the nation.''   The bill drew broad support from gun control groups when it wassigned May 23 by Gov. William Donald Schaefer.   Among those attending was White House Press Secretary JamesBrady, who was seriously wounded in the 1981 assassination attempton President Reagan by John Hinckley Jr., who was armed with thetype of gun that would be banned by the Maryland law.   Griisser said his committee has collected about $80,000,including $50,000 from the National Rifle Association, for itsdrive to defeat the gun law.   Gun owners are petitioning only one part of the bill. They wantto retain the second part, which would repeal a ruling by theMaryland Court of Appeals that victims of crimes committed withSaturday Night Specials can sue the makers and sellers of thehandguns.   State Attorney General J. Joseph Curran said Tuesday he hopes torule by next week whether only half of the bill can be subject toreferendum and, if so, whether the repeal of the court ruling canstand if the rest of the law is defeated by voters.</TEXT></DOC>
