JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A barrage of lawsuits claiming unsafe handlingof cancer-causing asbestos in buildings across the country mayrepresent only a fraction of the violations occurring every day,federal officials say.   One of the 13 lawsuits filed Tuesday said the New York City Boardof Education and seven demolition contractors didn't give theEnvironmental Protection Agency a chance to see if asbestos wasremoved properly from 130 school buildings.   ``The EPA has filed this action because we were precluded frominspecting this work,'' said John F. Dolinar, an EPA lawyer. ``Wecannot say whether it was removed properly or improperly. We have noway of knowing.''   The suit accused the city education department of failing to tellEPA officials that it had contracted with a number of companies toremove asbestos from the schools. Seven companies also were citedfor not reporting their work.   The lawsuits filed by the Justice Department seek unspecifieddamages against 45 companies, individuals and some local officials,alleging that federal health requirements weren't followed whenasbestos was removed from buildings.   EPA officials say those cited are believed to represent only afraction of similar violations that occur daily across the country.   The Justice Department said it has filed more than 100 similarlawsuits over the last five years involving $2.5 million inpenalties.   The EPA estimated that up to half the asbestos-connecteddemolitions and renovations conducted nationwide may violateprocedures required by federal air pollution laws. The agency lastyear was notified of more than 50,000 asbestos-related projects.   ``Today's coast-to-coast effort to punish violators is a messageto those who ignore the law,'' said Henry Habicht, EPA deputyadministrator. ``Asbestos is a known cause of cancer in humans andit can be a killer. Companies which think `business as usual' meansignoring the laws which protect public health will be prosecuted.''   The federal Clean Air Act and other laws require that asbestos beremoved before demolition begins, that the cancer-causing materialbe wetted down and enclosed in bags and that it be transported incovered trucks to approved disposal areas so microscopic fibersaren't spread through the air.   The inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause lung cancer;asbestosis, a scarring of the lung; and mesothelioma, a cancer ofthe chest and abdomen.   Asbestos was used before the mid-1970s as insulation in manybuildings, and the government says more than 730,000 buildings stillcontain some of the material.   Penalties for violating asbestos-removal requirements could rangeup to $25,000 per day of work for each violation. EPA officials saidmore than $250,000 in civil fines may be sought in some cases.   The suits involved renovation o demolition projects on buildingsin New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Illinois,Missouri, Kansas, California, Nevada and Washington.   Among the projects cited were renovations at public schools inWoodinville and Kent, Wash.; a high school in Kansas City, Mo.; ajunior high school in Holyrood, Kan.; and colleges in Pittsburg,Kan., and Berea, Ohio.   In a separate lawsuit Tuesday, the asbestos industry complainedthat while there may be concerns about how asbestos is being removedfrom older buildings, the EPA has failed to demonstrate thatvirtually all asbestos products should be banned.   The EPA last month announced a phase-out of most asbestosproducts, such as asbestos brake pads and linings and asbestoscement water pipes. The Asbestos Information Association said it hasasked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., to overturn theorder.   B.J. Pigg, president of the industry group, called the EPA action``an unfounded, politically convenient attack.'' He said modernasbestos products pose no significant health risks.   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the industry lawsuit raises noarguments that have not already been considered by the EPA.</TEXT></DOC>
