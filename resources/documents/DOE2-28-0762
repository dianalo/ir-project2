The unique design of eachcamera incorporates an intensified image tube and all of the supportingelectronics into a small package. This paper presents test data obtainedto date; the state-of-the-art measurement techniques used; the test results,which graphically demonstrate photocathode sensitivity, useful dynamicrange, static and dynamic fidelity, and gating-extinction ratio; andother information. 3 refs., 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
