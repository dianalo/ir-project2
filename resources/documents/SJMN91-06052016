The committee plans to convene aworkshop this spring to identify the technology and set the process in motion.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'BOLD TARGET' FOR CHIP REVIVALGROUP OUTLINES PLAN FOR INDUSTRY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The proposal was one of several in a second annual report by the committee,which released its gloomy findings on the state of the semiconductor andequipment industries at a Washington news conference. The committee said theU.S. semiconductor industry continued to lose ground to Japanese and othercompetitors in 1990 and warned the chip equipment industry needs more than a$1 billion investment to resuscitate it.;    The group of 13 industry andgovernment officials also elaborated on previously released recommendations --ranging from a permanent research and development tax credit to a 20 percentcapital gains tax -- that would give the semiconductor industry a boost.;   Notably missing from the list, however, was the group's controversial proposalof last year to put U.S. companies back into the consumer electronics business-- considered by many to be crucial to the health of the semiconductorindustry. The so-called Consumer Electronics Capital Corp. would have pooledgovernment and private money as seed capital to get large and small firms intothe business of making fax machines, videocassette recorders and otherlow-cost electronics products.;    The omission of that proposal worried someindustry observers, who feared the committee might have succumbed to politicalpressure. The Bush administration was vocal in its opposition to the idea andto any recommendations that would appear to put the semiconductor industry'sneeds ahead of any other group.;    &quot;This NACS report was emasculated afterthe last report hit the Bush administration,&quot; says Dan Hutcheson, president ofVLSI Research Inc. in San Jose. &quot;The proposals were controversial, and theywere slammed down.&quot;;    But Ian Ross, president of ATandamp;T's Bell Laboratoriesand chairman of the committee, said the consumer electronics proposal was leftout this time primarily because it would not have worked. Ross said thecommittee failed to find a way to make the idea practical without substantialgovernment help and feared it would not have been able to make sufficientfunds available at a low interest rate to encourage companies to get into thebusiness.;    He also acknowledged the idea was not well-received inWashington. &quot;We are practical people,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got something thatdoes not appear popular and maybe would not be effective, so we are not goingto pursue it.&quot;;    He stressed the committee did not bargain with theadministration concerning its recommendations. Instead, he said, the committeeconcentrated on workable solutions to the industry's problems.;    Among itsother proposals, the committee predicted investment in the U.S. chip industrycould be boosted by almost 20 percent if effective interest rates were loweredtwo percentage points by changes in the tax laws and giving individualsincentives to save.;    In addition, the group outlined three technology areasthat could prove important to the future of the semiconductor industry --fiber-optic communications, flat-panel display screens and intelligentvehicles and highway systems. Flat-panel screens are used in portablecomputers, and intelligent vehicles contain electronic devices that allow thedriver to communicate with the car.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  VALERIE RICE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910221  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  587  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 21, 199100052016,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
