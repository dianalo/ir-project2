It has been prepared in accordance with the United StatesDepartment of Energy Order 5484.1. This report presents monitoring datafor both radioactive and non-radioactive species in the local environment.Plant activities involve the handling of significant quantities of uranium,plutonium and tritium in the form of completed parts received from otherDOE facilities, resulting in a very low potential for release of theseradionuclides to the atmosphere. In 1987 only small releases of depleteduranium (depleted in the isotope U-235) and tritium occurred which couldhave affected the local environment. Monitoring data indicate that concentrationsof these nuclides in the environment are below established criteria forair and water and therefore should not present a health hazard eitherto employees or to the public. 23 refs., 12 figs., 28 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
