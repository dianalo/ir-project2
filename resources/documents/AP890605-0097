Earlier, at a news conference, the president declared thatChinese leaders must learn ``it's not going to be business asusual'' and accused the Beijing government of ``brutallysuppressing popular and peaceful demonstrations.''   But, while announcing sanctions on military sales, Bush alsosaid he would not withdraw the U.S. ambassador, take any othersteps toward severing diplomatic ties or take abrupt actions,including economic sanctions, that could ``hurt the Chinesepeople.''   Later, Bush told an audience of the nation's top businessleaders he was haunted by the ``bravery of that individual thatstood alone in front of the tanks rolling down the main avenue.''   ``What is it that gives him the courage to stand up in front ofa column of tanks right there in front of the world?'' Bush asked.``All I can say to him, wherever he might be, and to the peoplearound the world is we are and we must stand with him.''   Network television news broadcasts showed the remarkableconfrontation of the young man, who held up a column of 18 tanksfor three minutes, arguing with the crew of the lead tank. He waspushed to safety by the crowd and the tanks moved on.   Bush also told members of the Business Rountable that U.S.companies should continue to trade with China, that he did notsupport a suspension of trade despite the military brutality inBeijing.   Earlier, addressing two other international subjects at his newsconference, Bush spoke approvingly of a strong showing bySolidarity-backed candidates in Polish elections and said that ifthe Iranian government wants to improve relations after the weekenddeath of the Ayatollah Khomeini it should use its influence to freeAmerican hostages from Lebanon.   He said the events in China the past few days, in which hundredsof Chinese demonstrators were killed and many more wounded as thearmy moved to clear Tiananmen Square, were being followed in horrorby people around the world.   Bush, at a hastily called morning news conference, said theUnited States would:   _Immediately suspend military sales to China by the U.S.government as well as commercial exports of weapons.   _Halt visits between U.S. and Chinese military leaders.   _Give ``sympathetic review'' to visa extensions for any of the40,000 Chinese students studying in the United States who wereafraid of returning home.   _Offer humanitarian and medical aid through the Red Cross tothose injured in the assault.   Bush held out the possibility of further steps if the situationworsens. However, he said, ``I don't want to see a total break inthis relationship and I will not encourage a total break in thisrelationship.''   He also said keeping an ambassador in Beijing provided a ``goodlistening post.''   Bush's steps won praise from Democratic and Republican leaderson Capitol Hill. ``I think there was a general consensus for thepresident's position,'' House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash., said after a midafternoon meeting among Bush andcongressional leaders at the White House. ``I think he's done theright thing.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said ``there was a well-done feeling from allof us. We agreed right around the table that it would be incorrectto take any precipitous actions, that the president was handling itjust right and accordingly.''   Senate leaders said they would introduce a bipartisansense-of-the-Senate resolution on Tuesday backing the president'smoves and condemning the violence in China.   Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Bush's actions were``fine so far.'' However, he said stiffer measures, including tradesanctions and U.S. opposition to further international loans toChina, might be needed if the violence continues.   ``Those students in Beijing have played the real China card.They are demanding freedom and I think they are going to get it,''Helms said.   At the State Department, a spokeswoman said American students inBeijing were being advised to leave the campuses and gather inhotels because of the chaotic situation. However, the spokeswoman,Margaret Tutwiler, said there had been no threats against theAmericans.   The State Department also issued a new travel advisory,cautioning Americans not to visit China, and it instituted a``warden system'' of asking those already there to make theirpresence known to U.S. diplomatic offices.   Later Monday, at a meeting in the Oval Office, Bush told a groupof visiting Chinese students: ``We've got to speak out against thebrutality (but) somehow make clear that our argument, like yours,is just with those who resort to force, not the Chinese people.''   One of the students, Jia Hao, a doctoral candidate in politicalscience at George Washington University, said suspension ofmilitary sales would encourage the student demonstrators and be `abig blow for those who are responsible for the massacre, thosebutchers of Beijing.''   Some congressional critics have accused Bush of waiting too longto act in response to the crackdown.   But the president, who served as U.S. envoy to China in 1974-75and said he decided his course of action based on his knowledge ofChinese history, defended his pace. ``I don't feel that we'vewaited long when you have a force of this nature and you haveevents of this nature unfolding,'' he said.   On another subject, Bush said it was still unclear what thedeath over the weekend of Iranian leader Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini might mean for U.S. relations with that Islamic nation.   ``There's a way for the relationship with the United States toimprove and that's for the release of the American hostages'' beingheld in Lebanon, he said.   On still a third international subject, Bush said the fact thatcandidates backed by the labor union Solidarity appeared to bewinning in the Polish elections suggested this message: ``Communistbureaucrats, beware in Poland. It looks to me like there's quite amove moving towards freedom and democracy.''   On developments in China, Bush said, ``I can't begin to fathomexactly what led to the order to use force, because even asrecently as a couple of days ago, there was evidence that themilitary were under orders not to use force.''   Bush said halting arms sales ``is going to send a strong signal.I'm not saying it's going to cure the short-range problem in China... but I think it is very important the Chinese leaders know it'snot going to be business as usual.''   White House officials said that over $600 million in continuingmilitary sales to China would be affected _ including a $502million program to help the Chinese upgrade electronics on theirF-8 fighter jets.   Also affected are the final two units in a $62.5 million sale offour artillery-locating radars, a $28.5 million program forupgrading large-calibre ammunition production, and an $8.5 millionsale of torpedoes.   More than $700 million in commercial arms sales to China havebeen made since relations were normalized in 1979, including $85million last year.   He said he had not talked to Chinese leaders directly since theviolence but had talked to U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, who hadbeen in constant touch with them.</TEXT></DOC>
