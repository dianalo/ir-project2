John D. Rockefeller IV tells a Chamber of Commerce audience in this small Ohio River community. &quot;We're part of our own problem. American industry can't just keep running to government for relief.&quot;    But over in nearby Morgantown, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd puts the blame -- as well as the responsibility for protecting basic domestic industries -- squarely on the government. &quot;By the failure of our government to come to grips with the trade issue, we've lost thousands of jobs,&quot; he declares.    These differences underscore the complexity of the trade issue, which has recently emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the major themes of politics in the 1980s and possibly a principal issue in the 1988 elections.    As Congress considers the elements of a major trade package, it must grapple with the same question facing West Virginians as they listen to their two senators: whether to seek quotas, tariffs and other forms of import limits or to adopt a more limited approach that primarily seeks to increase U.S. competitiveness and exports.    Majority Leader Byrd takes a hard-line view, calling for quick action by Congress to protect import-battered industries like steel, textiles and shoes. Mr. Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who speaks Japanese and is an avid internationalist, calls on American business to &quot;be smarter.&quot;    Volker Jung, the president of Siemens Public Switching Systems Inc., a unit of Siemens AG, recently met with each lawmaker on trade issues. Sen. Rockefeller, he recalls, immediately began asking detailed questions about the differences between the U.S. and West German educational systems; Sen. Byrd focused on the loss of American jobs and &quot;wanted to know what are Siemens's goals in the U.S.&quot;    Adds Gary White, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association: &quot;Rockefeller tells us to make sacrifices to make our coal exports more competitive. . . . Byrd says he wants to protect basic industries and see that they keep their fair share of the domestic market.&quot;    The trade issue is crucial to West Virginians -- but it cuts in several directions. The state's major industry, mining, has been severely depressed for years; in steel, petrochemicals and glass, job losses to foreign competition have been high. But surprisingly, some 20% of what West Virginia produces is sold abroad -- far more than the 12% or so in the nation as a whole.    Both of West Virginia's senators are integrally involved in the congressional debate on trade. As the majority leader explains it, Sen. Rockefeller, who was just appointed to the Finance Committee, &quot;is in a good position from inside to help mold the legislation. I'm the catalyst to put it all together.&quot; Moreover, both agree that trade legislation is necessary, and they articulate the same general goals for their state; for example, both believe that the biggest hope for the state's future lies in high technology. &quot;We probably do bring somewhat different perspectives to the trade issue, but our goal is the same -- to make this country more competitive and to strengthen the economy of West Virginia,&quot; Sen. Byrd says.    When talk turns specific, the dissimilarities in their backgrounds, viewpoints and solutions begin to emerge. &quot;We've had different experiences,&quot; says Sen. Rockefeller. &quot;The different experiences mean we talk about trade in a different way.&quot;    Mr. Byrd, 69 years old, is a product of rural West Virginia. Raised by relatives after his mother died, he worked for 12 years to save enough money to go to college. His position as leader of the Senate's Democrats has made him a national figure, but he still identifies with the state's rural, largely unsophisticated populace. In depressed West Virginia, a job is a precious commodity, and the notion that trade is depriving people of jobs powerfully shapes Mr. Byrd's attitudes.    On a midweek visit to the state, the majority leader stops for coffee in Flatwoods, a town of 400 people along Interstate 79, smack in the middle of the state. The owner of the local truck stop tells Mr. Byrd about a nearby mill that has lost its market for barrel staves and blames the loss on unfair trading practices by foreign countries. In response, the senator talks about the need for tough trade legislation to &quot;make the country competitive again.&quot;    The next day, Mr. Byrd is the host at a well-attended conference promoting the development of a &quot;Software Valley&quot; in the state to be modeled after California's Silicon Valley. The majority leader is trying to persuade computer giants to set up shop in the state or contribute technology to help basic industries in West Virginia modernize and become more competitive.    By the end of the daylong event, the senator has obtained commitments from several companies to help in the project. Bell Atlantic Corp. decides to locate its new software-development center in West Virginia, and International Business Machines Corp. agrees to lend an executive to run the project.    Sen. Byrd's push for a Software Valley is consistent with his tendency to worry first about how domestic companies are surviving and then look for solutions from the U.S. government and the business community. Sen. Rockefeller, on the other hand, promptly starts out looking to other countries' practices and industries for models of what to do to improve the trade picture here.    A scion of one of the wealthiest families in the country, the 49-year-old Mr. Rockefeller has traveled the world extensively and lived for three years in Japan. He first moved to West Virginia as an anti-poverty worker, then decided to stay and start a political career, eventually serving two terms as governor.    Not surprisingly, Sen. Rockefeller has often looked to Japan for solutions to West Virginia's economic problems. He was instrumental in bringing Japan's sixth-largest steelmaker, Nisshin Steel Co., to the state; Nisshin is just breaking ground on a $65 million plant, a joint venture with the beleaguered Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. that will bring at least 100 jobs. At a lunch kicking off the joint venture, the senator gives a Japanese official a U.S. flag that once flew over the Capitol. To cheers, he has the Japanese executive hold up the flag with him.    &quot;Most of us have an upbeat feeling about&quot; the joint venture, says Elaine McAlpine, the craft director of the Brooke County Senior Citizen Center, who has a colorful, oversized Japanese calendar tacked up behind her desk. &quot;It's a chance to get some improvement here.&quot;    Even some workers who believe that they have been harmed by foreign companies look to the companies for help. Robert McMakin, a coal worker who was laid off in 1983, brings his resume to Sen. Rockefeller at a town meeting in the Fairmont public library, hoping to learn of potential jobs. &quot;I'm willing to work for a foreign company,&quot; says the father of two. &quot;I have a feeling the foreign companies put me out of work, and if they come into this country and pay Americans a fair wage so we can feed our families, I'm for it.&quot;    Other voters reflect the divisions between their two senators. At another town meeting at the library in McMechen, south of Wheeling, an overflow audience of steelworkers, retirees and others crowds among the bookshelves to voice its fears. Sentiment is strong for some form of protection against imports. &quot;When you say we're in a world market, it's an unfair market that is putting our people out of work,&quot; James Bosworth tells the senator. &quot;Maybe we should build a wall around ourselves.&quot; A woman in the audience calls out: &quot;Let's have a Boston tea party and throw all the Japanese products in the ocean!&quot;    But other voters think the issue is more complex. &quot;If you become too protectionist, you cut your nose off to spite your face,&quot; says Charles Beall, the secretary-treasurer of a Wellsburg lumber company. &quot;It could help steel, but it would hurt coal because they have to sell out of the country.&quot;    The only thing all voters seem to agree on is that something must be done. Wherever either senator goes in the state, he is besieged about the issue. &quot;I've heard at least five times about rumors of layoffs,&quot; Sen. Rockefeller says. &quot;So even if they have a job, they aren't secure.&quot;    Sen. Byrd takes pains to reassure voters that he will see to it that the trade picture improves. &quot;I don't intend to preside over a continuation of this decline,&quot; he says.    Sen. Rockefeller, though, isn't reassuring at all. In the tiny northern river town of New Cumberland, he pays a visit to the John D. Rockefeller IV Vocational Center, where his family door knocker graces the front entrance. At the center, a local TV camera crew asks him for a &quot;message&quot; to the area's steelworkers that they will have jobs.    &quot;There is no message anyone can give to guarantee survival,&quot; the senator replies. &quot;There's no guarantee for anything in global competition.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
