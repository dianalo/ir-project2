Measured in real time, this story is at least 24 years old. Congressional hearings into the &quot;HUD scandal&quot; will resume this month as Members compete to register their shock that something called influence peddling has been taking place in the environs of Washington. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development was created in 1965, an event that might as well have been an engraved invitation to every potential influence peddler in America.    Instead of giving the poor housing vouchers to buy their own shelter, Congress decided that it would involve itself heavily in the residential real-estate business. Congress accomplished this by making sure that the housing money flowed through and to middlemen. The middlemen, of course, included everyone connected with the wonderful world of subsidized real-estate development -- Congressmen themselves, federal bureaucrats, state and local politicians, bankers, unions and the developers. Somewhere at the bottom of this long, trickle-down funnel, no doubt, would be the genuinely poor.    This system essentially guaranteed that throughout HUD's existence, someone -- whether Congressmen or the consultants -- would be lobbying the department for contracts. Maybe it's theoretically possible to set up a more pristine system for doling out HUD's millions, but there is zero talk in Congress of such reform. That would diminish Congress's ability to win favors for constituents, and to get political contributions from some of those constituents.    Under Jimmy Carter's presidency, for example, Section 8 HUD spending soared and much of it flowed to developers with Democratic ties. One major Carter contributor, Thomas Rosenberg of Chicago, won HUD funding for no less than 35 housing projects. According to a 1980 study by the Boston Herald, 70% of the campaign money Mr. Carter raised in Massachusetts in 1979 came from Section 8 developers, who in turn got 90% of all Section 8 grants in the state. One developer told the Herald, &quot;We've been rowing the boat for Carter in Massachusetts. In return, the President has been generous, to say the least.&quot;    None of this &quot;influence peddling,&quot; all well known at the time, attracted any Congressional or media outrage. Why should it, since Members were often the ones lobbying HUD for projects on behalf of developers?    One Member whose interest in HUD was, until recently, limited to shoveling pork back home is Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), chairman of the housing oversight panel until 1987. Former HUD officials say Rep. Frank constantly demanded bigger grants for his district, including one for $500,000 for which he personally thanked HUD Secretary Sam Pierce. Mr. Frank explains that lobbying by Members is totally different from that of HUD consultants because the Members don't profit directly from the grants and are merely providing &quot;constituent service.&quot;    All this time spent with HUD on &quot;constituent service&quot; must be the reason Members in the 1970s and early 1980s didn't notice a mounting pile of reports by then HUD Inspector General Charles Dempsey detailing corruption and abuses in HUD programs. &quot;HUD has over the years been a very political agency, and it's bipartisan,&quot; Mr. Dempsey told Human Events magazine. &quot;Many congressmen wanted things to go on the way they were because the developers and home builders were very interested in having these programs go on. It didn't bother them that much.&quot;    Now that some HUD officials have dared to steer some housing funds to their friends, instead of letting the Members parcel them out, Congress is steaming. Rep. Marty Martinez (D., Calif.) publicly lectured HUD Secretary Jack Kemp on proper Beltway etiquette. He said that under Sam Pierce he was irritated &quot;that it was so difficult for many of us in Congress to open the doors for our constituents to the opportunities that should have existed there for them. And I have full confidence now that the situation will be remedied.&quot;    For all his shortcomings, Sam Pierce did try to close down the most abused programs and expand the use of vouchers. But Congress still insists that none of the scandal-tarred programs be cut. Perhaps the one obvious lesson to be drawn from all this is that if you are truly put off by the sight of political influence peddling, don't create subsidized programs in the first place. But it looks as if Congress is drawing a somewhat different lesson from the HUD affair: Never leave a paper trail.    The new appropriations bill for the Interior Department actually has a provision that prohibits Interior employees from keeping any record of contacts with &quot;Members and Commitees of Congress and their staff.&quot; It will be interesting to see if this anti-accountability measure spreads to other appropriations bills, including HUD's. </TEXT></DOC>
