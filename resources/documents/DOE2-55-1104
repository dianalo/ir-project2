<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1104 </DOCNO><TEXT>Many significant advances in our understanding of the genetics of CysticFibrosis (CF) have taken place since the last major review of this subject.New data on the incidence of the disease, its mode of inheritance, andgenetic heterogeneity have been reported. More significantly, linkagestudies have identified the chromosomal location of the CF gene(s) andthis has led to improved genetic management. Finally, insights into thenature of the biochemical defect have been obtained. This article doesnot cover the subjects of genetic management or the basic defect, sincethese are discussed in detail elsewhere in this volume. Instead, it concentrateson a review of the new data on incidence, obtained both from populationstudies that led to the chromosomal localization, and the evidence onheterogeneity that has been obtained from both population studies andfrom the linkage analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
