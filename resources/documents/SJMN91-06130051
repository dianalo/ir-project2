The bruise forced Hoiles to leave thegame, and his status is listed as day to day.;    Needing only a triple topitch for the cycle, Willie Wilson obliged with a shot to left field. Wilsonslid into third but could have made it a stand-up triple. At that point,Williamson mercifully was replaced by Paul Kilgus.; BAINES SITS: How good arethe A's?;    &quot;I've got to figure we're pretty good if a guy who hits threehomers and seven RBIs isn't in the lineup the next day,&quot; said Manager Tony LaRussa.;    That man, of course, was designated hitter Harold Baines. La Russainsisted that the left-handed-hitting Baines was given the day off because hewas stiff, not because the Orioles started left-hander Mike Flanagan.;NELSON'S COMEBACK: Gene Nelson, on the disabled list since April 10, will goto Phoenix today and throw Friday at the A's extended spring training camp.;   Nelson will throw batting practice Monday and on May 16 will either pitchbatting practice or in a simulated game. His performance may determine if hecan return to the A's before May 20, when they return from a 10-game trip.;ETC.: If Dave Stewart is placed on the disabled list, he will be the ninth A'splayer to go on it this season. Last season, the A's went until Aug. 23 beforeplacing a ninth player on the D.L. . . . Wilson played right field for thefirst time this season and found the going rough. He misplayed a flyball thatfell for a double in the ninth inning.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN AKERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Oakland  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910509  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  349  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 9, 199100130051,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
