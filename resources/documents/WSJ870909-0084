Meanwhile, a group of eight Japanese banks agreed in principle to a bailout plan for Tateho that would allow the company to keep operating while a rehabilitation plan is worked out.    The chemical manufacturer is believed to have incurred a loss of about 28 billion yen ($197 million) in speculative trades, far more than its net assets of 16.5 billion yen. Last week's announcement by the company that it faced such losses prompted widespread speculation that other Japanese companies also may register sharp losses on their investments. Many Japanese companies, particularly manufacturers, have turned to investments in securities to make up for the decline in profits caused by the sharp appreciation of the yen, but prices on the Japanese bond market have fallen sharply since peaking in May.    Tateho's announcement caused Tokyo's financial markets to tumble, though prices have since rebounded slightly. It also prompted authorities here to plan investigations of the Japanese government-bond futures market and of the possibility that companies with ties to Tateho may have been involved in insider trading in the company's shares before the announcement.    Takashi Matsukawa, director of the Secondary Market Division of the Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau, said investigators are scrutinizing contacts between Nikko officials and investors who sold Tateho stock.    &quot;The question is whether they got their information from Nikko,&quot; Mr. Matsukawa said. &quot;I doubt it was disseminated at the management level. But how do you check every leak between a salesman and his client?&quot;    Nikko yesterday denied that the firm was involved in insider trading. Susumu Yamazaki, managing director of Nikko's fixed-income securities department, said the brokerage didn't deal in Tateho shares for its own account, though records at the Osaka Stock Exchange, where Tateho is listed, show that Nikko was a heavy seller in the weeks leading up to the chemical company's Sept. 2 disclosure that it was facing losses.    &quot;Nikko was holding stock for our customers, so when they sold shares it showed up on our books,&quot; Mr. Yamazaki said. &quot;We've been managing information so thoroughly that we aren't worried about insider-trading allegations.&quot;    Mr. Yamazaki said that Nikko delayed disclosure of the financial crisis at Tateho so that a plan could be worked out to try to save the company. He said that Nikko, which is Tateho's main underwriter and provided brokerage services for about half the company's transactions in bond futures, first learned of Tateho's troubles in mid-July, when the chemical company failed to meet margin calls in a rapidly declining bond-futures market. He said Nikko extended credit while advising Tateho to get out of the market.    Nikko officials didn't know of the potential scope of the losses until Aug. 19, Mr. Yamazaki said. On the following day, the brokerage notified the Ministry of Finance and instructed its internal surveillance department to monitor for trading irregularities in Tateho shares.    Nikko delayed full disclosure over the next two weeks while trying to negotiate a bailout plan with Tateho's banks, Mr. Yamazaki said. &quot;We knew the stock price had to drop and we wanted to disclose it as soon as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;Our concern was how to rebuild the finances of the company.&quot;    The Tateho case emerged just one day after the Japanese securities industry introduced a new program of self-regulation to prevent securities-trading abuses such as insider trading. Only one case of insider trading has ever gone to court in Japan.    Under the preliminary bailout plan announced by Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. yesterday, the bank will provide funds that will allow Tateho to operate while a rehabilitation plan is worked out. The eight banks also agreed to a suspension of principal payments on their loans to Tateho, though the company will continue to make interest payments. Tateho's loans outstanding are estimated at more than 20 billion yen.    Taiyo Kobe said the bank will negotiate the repayment, due tomorrow, of 1.2 billion yen owed to Chugoku Bank Ltd. by Tateho. Chugoku Bank had insisted on the repayment before agreeing to the bailout plan for Tateho.    The other banks involved in the bailout are Daiwa Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., Kyowa Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Hanshin Sogo Bank Ltd.    Taiyo Kobe officials said the banks will work out a rehabilitation plan for Tateho within one or two months. They refused to discuss possible details of such a plan, but some industry officials believe that Tateho eventually will be merged with another company. Meanwhile, Taiyo Kobe said the bank will send financial experts to help manage Tateho's accounting department. </TEXT></DOC>
