Nynex said its unregulated unit, Nynex InformationTechnologies Co., will record on CD-ROM a national list ofmore than 77 million residential and business telephonenumbers for Metromail, including the Nynex phone listings inNew York and New England.</LP><TEXT>   Metromail currently sells phone listings retrievable viaan on-line database, and its parent, R.R. Donnelley andamp; SonsCo., publishes the Cole's directories, which list phonenumbers by street address.   Nynex has been selling its own listings on CD-ROM since1987 and has developed software that allows a computer tosearch the listings by surname, address and phone number,said a Nynex spokesman. However, the spokesman said Nynex'scustomers have indicated they want more than just a regionallisting.   The Metromail-Nynex directory won't be the first CD-ROMproduct, but it will be the first national listing that canbe searched in multiple ways, said Joshua M. Harris, ananalyst at Jupiter Communications Co., a research firm.   PhoneDisc USA, Marblehead, Mass., sells a national listingthat can be searched only by surname. In addition, U S WestInc. sells a CD-ROM listing of phone numbers covering itsWestern region only, but the Denver Bell regional has stoppedupdating the list.   James Bryant, PhoneDisc's co-chairman said the companyplans to come out with its own multisearch CD-ROM listing inthe first quarter of next year. &quot;And our listing carries 110million listings.&quot;   CD-ROM represents &quot;a major battleground for the phoneindustry,&quot; Mr. Harris said. &quot;Everytime somebody looks up alisting with a computer, it's a 50-cent loss to the localoperating company,&quot; which offers operator service. Mr. Harrissaid the directory-assistance business alone is currently a$1.8 billion market dominated by huge operating companiessuch as the Baby Bells and GTE Corp.   The &quot;strategic alliance&quot; with Metromail will allow Nynexto sell an expanded national phone list to its businesscustomers and find a market for its software, which isdesigned to enable a computer user to record the listingsdata on CD and search it in various ways.   A Metromail spokesman said &quot;there are other relationshipswe're looking at with other providers.&quot; However, Nynex willbe the exclusive recorder of the information, he added.   The companies said they will begin selling the nine-diskset of listings by February. A less complete version of thenew product will be sold beginning next month. Pricing wasn'tdisclosed, but Nynex is currently selling various formats ofits CD-ROM list of 10 million phone numbers for $595 to$9,500, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
