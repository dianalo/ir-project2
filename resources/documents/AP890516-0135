Meanwhile, home prices in many Midwestern industrial citiesposted healthy appreciation rates and real estate in oil-producingstates showed a spotty recovery, the National Association ofRealtors said.   The median price of an existing home in the San Francisco areasoared to $243,900 in the first quarter, meaning half sold for moreand half sold for less. That represented a 31.8 percent increasefrom a year ago and was the steepest appreciation rate among 83metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group.   In fact, California accounted for the top five appreciationrates in the nation. Home prices in Orange County shot up 30.2percent to a median of $237,900. In Los Angeles, prices rose 26.3percent to $201,000; in San Diego, 21.9 percent to $163,900; and inRiverside-San Bernardino, 21.6 percent to $116,000.   That compares with the 3.4 percent increase to $91,600 for themedian-priced existing home for the entire United States.   A healthy diversified economy, population growth and foreigninvestment, particularly from the Japanese, are fueling the boom inCalifornia, according to economist Mark Zandi of the WEFA Group, aBala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.   He and other analysts said, however, that the West Coast marketmay be in danger of overheating.   ``I would be concerned .... that at this point it'sspeculatively driven and that the bubble may be about to burst,''Zandi said. ``Californians seem to have no concern for the amountof debt they're taking on. They seem to think home prices cancontinue escalating forever.''   ``My guess is you're getting close to the end of this very rapidprice appreciation in California,'' said economist Mark Obrinsky ofthe Federal National Mortgage Association. ``I think in this casethe reason is going to be mortgage rates as much as anything else.''   Fixed-rate mortgages started out the quarter averaging 10.77percent and jumped nearly half a percentage point to 11.19 percentby the end of the period. One-year, adjustable-rate mortgages wentfrom 8.49 percent to 9.31 percent. In the first quarter a year ago,mortgage rates were falling.   Northeastern cities continued to be some of the most expensiveplaces to live, but home prices in New York City and its suburbs;Boston and Worcester, Mass.; and Hartford and New Haven, Conn.,either fell or rose only modestly.   New York area prices _ the fifth highest in the nation, afterSan Francisco, Orange County, Honolulu and Los Angeles _ sunk 2.8percent to $181,700.   The five least expensive areas in the country were: Peoria,Ill., $42,000; Spokane, Wash., $50,200; Mobile, Ala., $50,900;Oklahoma City, $52,300; and Akron, Ohio, $56,000.   In Texas, the median price of houses and condominiums in Houstonrecovered 4.5 percent to $62,900, while the median rose 2.7 percentto $88,400 in Dallas.   ``I would certainly treat the Dallas information as a verypositive sign that the Southwest is on the mend,'' said economistJames Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.   But home values in smaller Texas cities and elsewhere inoil-dependent states continued to drop.   The five biggest declines were in Fort Worth, Texas, 10.9percent; Oklahoma City, 7.4 percent; Baton Rouge, La., 7 percent;Worcester, Mass., 5.9 percent; and Tulsa, Okla., 4.7 percent.   A number of Midwestern cities, bolstered by a resurgence inmanufacturing caused by last year's boom in export sales, postedstrong appreciation rates, including Chicago, up 7 percent,Columbus, Ohio, up 11.6 percent, Indianapolis, up 10 percent, andSt. Louis, up 9.9 percent.   The Realtors said the pace of existing home sales laggednationally and in most states, although several states withlow-cost housing areas managed to buck the trend.   Nationally, sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rateof 3.82 million units, down 6.6 percent from the last quarter of1988. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia posteddeclines, while 22 states recorded increases.   West Virginia showed the greatest sales pickup, 61.3 percent,followed by South Dakota, 43.5 percent; North Dakota, 27.1 percent;Washington, 22.3 percent; and Vermont, 21.6 percent.   The states with the biggest sales declines were Alaska, 40.6percent; Utah, 27.7 percent; Louisiana, 23.8 percent; Iowa, 20.2percent; and Minnesota, 17.7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
