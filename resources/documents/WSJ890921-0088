The move appears designed to protect Oandamp;Y's original investment in Campeau.    Under agreements with Oandamp;Y, Campeau will, if requested by Oandamp;Y, offer to buy back two series of Campeau debentures, Campeau said. The buy-back, at par plus accrued interest, would occur within 12 months after the planned restructuring of Campeau and its subsidiaries is completed. Oandamp;Y is an investment holding and real-estate concern owned by Toronto's Reichmann brothers.    Campeau would offer to repurchase all of its 184 million Canadian dollars (US$155 million) of 7.5% convertible debentures, Series A, and all of its US$260 million of 7% convertible debentures.    At last report, Oandamp;Y held C$46.6 million of the Series A debt, convertible into 1.48 million shares, and all of the 7% debt, convertible into 10 million shares. The Campeau debt held by Oandamp;Y is convertible into stock representing about one-third of Oandamp;Y's 38.4% fully diluted stake in Campeau. Campeau Chairman Robert Campeau's fully diluted stake in Campeau is currently 43.2%.    Campeau said the aggregate amount needed to buy back the debentures can't exceed the net proceeds received by Campeau and its subsidiaries from the restructuring. Oandamp;Y has agreed to lend Campeau US$250 million to help it meet liquidity needs, and will supervise a major refinancing and restructuring of Campeau and its subsidiaries, which include Bloomingdale's and other department store chains.    Campeau said its agreement with Oandamp;Y regarding the restructuring will be in effect for two years and may be extended to about four years.    Ross Cowan, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., said the buy-back agreement appears to be a &quot;safety clause&quot; for Oandamp;Y's earlier investment in Campeau, if Campeau's stock price doesn't improve after the restructuring.    &quot;It looks like a backstop for Oandamp;Y to protect their original capital in the convertible debentures,&quot; Mr. Cowan said.    The Series A debt is convertible into Campeau stock at C$31.50 a share, and the 7% debt is convertible at US$26 a share. In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Campeau closed at C$15.125, up 87.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million shares. </TEXT></DOC>
