Fastest out of the gate so far has been the semiconductorgroup, up more than 30% this year as investors envision areviving economy spurring demand for chips in computers,electronics and automobiles. Yet there's a growing feeling onthe Street that in the 1990s, most of the high-tech winnerswill be found among software and related stocks -- notcomputer &quot;boxes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The paradigm of the 1980s was that hardware soldsoftware,&quot; says SoundView analyst John C. Maxwell III; &quot;thereverse is true for the 1990s.&quot; His recent report predicts&quot;explosive growth&quot; in software and information sciences inthis decade.   Novell will remain an OTC leader as cost-consciouscorporations use its &quot;networking&quot; software to allow theirpersonal computers to talk to one another, says Peter Canelo,strategist for County NatWest Securities. &quot;Instead of buyinga big computer, Novell's software lets you wire a bunch oflittle ones together.&quot; With the Provo, Utah, company sailingalong at 39 times estimated profit of $1.54 a share for thefiscal year ending in October, Novell isn't cheap.   But in view of the company's dominance in networking, thestock deserves a higher multiple than the broader market,reasons Roger McNamee, a co-manager of the recently formedIntegral Partners Limited Partnership. Novell rules the roost&quot;in one of the most rapidly growing sectors of theeconomy-networking,&quot; he says. Nearly 80% of the $85 millionpartnership Mr. McNamee co-manages with John Powell waslodged in computer-related shares when the fund opened lastmonth; many health care stocks looked too expensive.   The partnership has a four-person office in Palo Alto,Calif., that Mr. McNamee calls an &quot;office of the future.&quot;High-powered software and computer equipment whir away atjobs that would otherwise require three extra employees, hesays. Scattered around are products from Microsoft, AdobeSystems and Symantec, which, among other products, providessoftware to banish destructive computer viruses; Mr.McNamee's group owns stock in all three companies.   Toting along his portable Apple notebook computer, &quot;I takemy office with me in my briefcase everywhere I go,&quot; Mr.McNamee says. &quot;There's no reason for a computer to be stuckon a desk.&quot; When he returns to the main office, he grabs aproduct made by Radius -- whose stock he also owns -- to plughis detachable computer into the office's computer network.At Friday's 10 1/2, Radius sells at about 18 times estimatedearnings of 60 cents a share for fiscal 1992 ending inSeptember.   Mr. McNamee is convinced Apple Computer is a good bet.&quot;They've got a new religion -- it's real pragmatic,&quot; he says.The computer maker now rolls out more products, morefrequently, and isn't as fearful of failure, he says.&quot;They're behaving more like a consumer electronics company --and the computer industry is behaving more that way.&quot; He'shopeful about two enhanced computers due out later this yearand expects Apple to earn about $4.50 a share for the fiscalyear ending in September: at about 14 times estimatedearnings, the stock is one of the cheaper ones in thetechnology universe.   Few other makers of computer hardware draw raves frominvestors. Money manager Paul Wick of Seligman Communicationsandamp; Information Sciences, a mutual fund, is among those who aresteering clear of the fiercely competitive group. &quot;Pricecutting is ubiquitous,&quot; says Mr. Wick. &quot;It's so brutallycompetitive that no one can make good profit margins.&quot;   Yet Scitex appears both fast-growing and a bargain to Mr.Wick. The Israeli company makes computer workstations andrelated products used in printing, publishing and advertisingfor page design and other graphics uses. Scitex just reportedearnings for fiscal 1992, ended in February, of $2.70 ashare, up from $2.10 a share a year earlier. Analysts expectthe company to earn about $3.08 a share this fiscal year,according to First Call, a unit of Thomson FinancialNetworks. At 41 Friday, the stock sells at less than 14 timesestimated earnings.   Borland International, still digesting Ashton-Tate, isexpected to pick up steam later this year when it ships itsQuattro Pro spreadsheet software for use with Microsoft'sWindows software. The stock is recommended as a long-termcore holding by SoundView.   Microsoft's popular Windows operating system will sparkanother major round of new software products later this year,Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund says. &quot;To the extentwe've seen Microsoft benefit from Windows, now others willbenefit, as they roll out their Windows-based applications,&quot;he says.   Mr. Sherlund estimates that Microsoft's sales of Windows,various software applications of Windows and the &quot;mouse&quot;pointing device used to run the software will total about$1.56 billion in fiscal 1992, ending in June -- up 85% from ayear earlier and about 58% of Microsoft's total expectedsales. Despite the stock's loft price of 119 1/4, it remainsa staple among portfolio managers and analysts. Wall Streetexpects Microsoft's per-share earnings to rise 44% to $3.57in fiscal 1992 and 29% to $4.61 in fiscal 1993, according toFirst Call.   In the short run, the economy-linked semiconductor stocksremain favorites for large investors such as Daniel Leonardof Denver's Financial Strategic Technology Portfolio.Confident of an economic recovery, Mr. Leonard has beenloading up on Intel and National Semiconductor, traded on theNew York exchange, while pocketing some profits in costlierstocks such as Microsoft. Although Intel at 67 1/8 is tradingnear its 52-week high and has more than quadrupled in lessthan 12 months, the semiconductor leader still looksreasonable to Mr. Leonard given his expectation the companywill earn $4.10 a share this year and $5.10 in 1993 --boosted partly by sales of its next-generation 586microprocessor.   Not all semiconductor stocks are equal, however. Nor doesthe group historically offer exceptional returns, saysMerrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak. He wonderswhether Advanced Micro Devices' profit will continue to climbas it clones Intel's older-generation chips. He expects TexasInstruments' struggles to continue amid slowing demand forso-called dynamic random access memory chips.   But specialty chip maker Altera does appeal to Mr. Kurlak.The San Jose, Calif., company makes &quot;programmable logicdevices,&quot; little chips that allow customers to repeatedlyreprogram the computer logic they need to run such systems ascellular telephone networks, rather than wait for a lengthycustom-designed change. Altera isn't alone in its field, butMr. Kurlak expects per-share earnings to grow about 26% to$1.10 this year from 87 cents a share in 1991. Though thestock's not cheap at Friday's 32 1/4, more than 29 times hisexpected earnings, he says its growth rate justifies an evenhigher multiple.   ---   Friday Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks eased as investors cashed in theirgains in advance of the long holiday weekend.

Robertson Stephens andamp; Co. analyst Mark Simonreduced his short-term rating on Centocor to &quot;hold&quot; andupgraded his opinion on Xoma to &quot;buy.&quot; An assistant said Mr.Simon now expects both companies' septic shock treatment tobe approved by the Food and Drug Administration in lateMarch, unlike many analysts who expect Centocor to have a bigadvantage with approval long before Xoma.   Newly public Advantage Health closed at 17 1/2, unchangedfrom its offering price, on 2.3 million shares.
