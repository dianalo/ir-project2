Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><TEXT>   The Coast Guard cutter Ingham hasn't seized a drug-smuggling vessel since April 1, 1982, when she ran down the Misfit, loaded with 35 tons of marijuana. But give the old Ingham a break: commissioned 52 years ago, she's running out of steam.    The Rev. Jesse Jackson says he would do something about that. If he's elected president, he would pump more than $300 million in additional funds into the Coast Guard budget so, among other things, ancient cutters like the Ingham could be replaced by modern vessels that might actually catch drug smugglers.    But Mr. Jackson stands alone among presidential candidates in pressing the drug issue as a major campaign theme.    &quot;Until now, other than Rev. Jackson, no candidate has dramatically emphasized the depth of this issue,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, chairman of the House Narcotics Committee and a Jackson supporter. &quot;The issue has to be elevated. Our kids are dying in the streets.&quot;    Mr. Jackson, in fact, published his anti-drug budget the other day, spelling out how he would increase spending from the $3.9 billion proposed by Mr. Reagan for fiscal 1989 to $6.7 billion, up a whopping 71%.    But, if the drugs problem isn't an issue now, it could become one in the general election.    Of all the other candidates, Democratic and Republican, Vice President George Bush has the most to lose from it. He has been the Reagan administration's point man on drugs and, in response to a questionnaire from this newspaper that asked about his proudest achievements, he listed just two: One of them, he said, is &quot;the role I've played in spearheading the administration's . . . South Florida Task Force and our efforts to interdict the flow of illegal drugs into our country.&quot;    And in the three paragraphs he devotes to the drug problem in his autobiography, he says: &quot;My own work&quot; with the South Florida Task Force &quot;led to a greater awareness of the scope of the drug threat to this country and the fact that we're involved in a war -- not just figuratively, but literally -- against illegal drug traffickers.&quot;    Thus, a question being asked more frequently by Democratic presidential candidates: How could Mr. Bush, spearheading the anti-drug program, not know that Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, was suspected of being a drug trafficker at the same time he may have been on the CIA payroll?    Sen. Albert Gore puts it this way: &quot;It is shocking that this administration apparently had evidence indicating that Noriega was involved in smuggling drugs to the United States, that they (administration officials) pretended the evidence didn't exist and continued to deal with him partly because he was helpful to their objectives in Nicaragua.&quot;    If Mr. Bush becomes the GOP nominee -- almost a sure bet now -- the Noriega question and the record of the Reagan administration in fighting drugs will be a legitimate issue. &quot;The Democrats will have a field day,&quot; predicts Kevin Phillips, a GOP theoretician.    There is another, more mundane question: Has the South Florida Task Force -- it later grew into an even more grandiose National Narcotics Border Interdiction System -- stanched the flow of drugs?    Sen. Robert Dole, still hanging in as a GOP presidential candidate, rarely misses a chance to criticize Mr. Bush, his nemesis. He doesn't miss on this one. The South Florida Task Force, Mr. Dole says, has been &quot;badly managed. It isn't working.&quot; Mr. Dole, who has given two speeches on the drug issue, says he would bring the &quot;full force&quot; of the nation's armed services and intelligence agencies into the fight on drugs. And he'd impose the death penalty on drug &quot;kingpins.&quot; No other candidate takes as harsh a stance.    Statistics on the flow of drugs into this country are notoriously unreliable. But the best guess by the Drug Enforcement Administration is that the flow of cocaine into the U.S. in 1981, when the idea of the task force was born, was anywhere from 33 to 60 metric tons, sold on delivery for about $40,000 per kilo (2.2 pounds). Last year, says the DEA, about 80 tons of cocaine crossed the borders, an estimate the agency admits is probably low, and the cost on delivery was about $15,000 per kilo. So, more cocaine -- the major concern of drug-fighters these days -- is coming in and the nation's estimated five million cocaine abusers can buy it on the street a lot more cheaply.    Mr. Jackson calls it &quot;the No. 1 threat to our daily lives.&quot; He has visited hundreds of high schools, preaching his simple message: &quot;Down with dope. Up with hope.&quot;    &quot;If you've tried dope,&quot; he says, &quot;stand.&quot; Slowly, one by one, students rise to their feet. They come down to the gymnasium floor, many of them in tears. They embrace. Later, says Mr. Jackson, they go home and talk about their drug problem with their parents for the first time. They talk, too, about Mr. Jackson. In breaking down the walls between Mr. Jackson and white voters, nothing has been more effective.    No other candidate could manage anything so emotional and dramatic as this. No other candidate, in fact, seems quite sure how to address the drug problem.    Maybe it's because so many of them talked themselves hoarse back in 1986 when the Congress debated and finally passed legislation that allows the military to play a more active role in drug interdiction, stiffens penalties for drug-dealing offenses and ties U.S. foreign aid to drug-eradication efforts in nations that have exported drugs to the U.S.    But still the drugs pour in with dope-peddling gangs openly shooting it out in broad daylight in many big cities.    Politicians don't often like to discuss problems that seem to defy legislative solution. So most of them talk in quick fixes and platitudes.    Rep. Richard Gephardt: &quot;'Just say no' is not enough.&quot;    Gov. Michael Dukakis: &quot;More needs to be done.&quot;    Sen. Dole: &quot;More needs to be done&quot; (including the death penalty and calling out the Army, Navy and Marines).    Sen. Paul Simon: A Simon administration &quot;will work actively toward the establishment of a 'drug czar' position with far-reaching access and responsibility.&quot;    And Mr. Bush: Taking a swipe at Mr. Dole, he says it would be a mistake to call out the Army, Navy and the Marines. &quot;Our nation has a longstanding aversion to the military performing civil law-enforcement functions. . . .&quot;    Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont had perhaps the most original thought before he dropped out of the GOP race: Make teen-agers pass a drug test before they qualify for a driver's license. He conceded some people might worry about individual rights.    To Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard commandant, the problem is quantifiable. &quot;The budget passed for the Coast Guard this year leaves me $103 million in the hole,&quot; he says. And, because of the shortfall, he's closing Coast Guard stations and cutting back on patrols by his aircraft and his cutters -- even the 52-year-old Ingham.    He blames the Congress. Mr. Jackson blames the president.    And the experts in trying to deal with the national drugs crisis despair. &quot;You can't stop the flow of drugs with ships and planes,&quot; says Harvard University's Mark Kleiman. &quot;All you can do is drive the costs of the drugs on the street up -- a little.&quot;    He and other experts all say the only solution is to spend less on the supply side and a lot more on the demand side. Make it more difficult to buy drugs on the street. Educate children. Counsel people who want to break the habit.    &quot;The problem,&quot; Mr. Kleiman says, &quot;is in persuading five million people to stop doing something they like to do.&quot;    ---         Jesse Jackson's Proposed Anti-Drug Budget                  (In millions of dollars)                         REAGAN                       PROPOSED       JACKSON                           1989      PROPOSED    DIFFERENCE Law Enforcement and Interdiction - Justice                 $1,504        $1,964      +  31% Treasury (Customs)         523           784      +  50 Dept. of Trans (Coast Guard)              625           938      +  50 Dept. of Defense            98            98        -- State Department           111           300      + 270 Other                       17            17        -- SUBTOTAL                 2,878         4,101      +  42 Prevention                 611           917      +  50 Treatment                  425         1,685      + 395 TOTAL                   $3,914        $6,703      +  71%</TEXT></DOC>
