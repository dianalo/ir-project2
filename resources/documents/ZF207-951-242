 With the tremendous growth of Japanese financial power,evident more and more in the purchase of U.S.andP;  companies, Japan is nowcasting a dark shadow over the future of the U.S.andP;  software industry.andM;But can Japan really export software?andP;  Most people connected with theJapanese computer industry are more likely to believe that three-eyed aliensreally did land in Russia.andP;  Americans knowledgeable about the condition ofthe industry in Japan are likely to be of the same opinion.andM;But Japanese-made software is already popping up, alien-like, in theU.S.--not in the office but in the home.andM;Nintendo of America, with sales of more than $1.5 billion in the U.S., istaking the overwhelming share of the computer game market.andP;  And half of thesesales are in software.andM;Nintendo's U.S.andP;  operations began with arcade game machines in the early1980s.andP;  Nintendo Entertainment Systems (NES) entered the picture in 1985, andit has since resuscitated the game machine market, which crashed when Atarifaltered.andM;The company's success is explained by a marketing strategy that combinescheap, but high-quality, hardware with good software that is well-matched toAmerican tastes, and strong service.andM;But Nintendo is not simply a maker of toys.andP;  Its success has been basedmainly on its marketing and software development ability.andM;Despite long-held and sometimes erroneous beliefs about the Japanese softwareindustry, it will not be long before the Japanese appear in the internationalmarket.andM;However, it will take time.andP;  In Nintendo's case, the right conditions werepresent in the domestic Japanese market--stiff competition necessitatingproducts which were high in quality, low in price and original in software.andO;But these conditions do not prevail in the software industry today.andM;THE CURRENT SITUATIONandM;The Japanese hardware market is next in size to that of the U.S., and isgrowing rapidly.andP;  In 1987, 6,200 mainframes and 300,000 general-purposecomputers were running, along with 400,000 small business computers and over2 million 16-bit PCs.andP;  These figures represent an annual growth rate of 20%.andM;Against this hardware sales background, the software industry has beengrowing, but has not been able to meet burgeoning domestic demand.andP;  Industrysales in 1987 totalled $7.6 billion ($SUS1 = 145yen), according to marketsources.andM;With annual growth rates in the industry exceeding 20%, sales have likelyalready passed the $10 billion mark.andP;  However, software products themselvesaccounted for no more than 13% of total sales, and only passed the $1 billionmark around 1987.andP;  The other 87% or so of sales come from subcontractsoftware development and facility management.andM;The product sales breakdown is 50% originals, 40% imports and 10% productsdeveloped by other companies, according to published research.andM;WORKER SHORTAGE A &quot;CRISIS&quot;andM;If custom programs are to be developed to meet the demand for software, anincreasing number of systems engineers and programmers will be needed.andP;  Thebiggest single problem in the industry is a shortage of workers.andM;According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)forecasts on the balance of supply and demand for software engineers, theshortfall will be 251,000 in 1990, 512,000 in 1995, and by the year 2000 willtop 965,000 against a demand for some 2.14 million.andP;  In Japan, this isreferred to as &quot;the software crisis.&quot;andM;However, salary levels for systems engineers and programmers in Japan arehigh.andP;  It is difficult to get software engineers of a suitable standard atsalaries of even $100,000 a year.andP;  Considering that the growth rate islow--2% or 3% on sales of $70,000 per person--it is clear that the softwareindustry is not in good business shape.andM;A further problem is that programmers vary widely in ability.andP;  Already manycompanies have plans to import programmers from South Korea and SoutheastAsia in the guise of &quot;technical trainees,&quot; but even this is unlikely to fillthe gap.andM;Many point out that the worker shortage is in fact caused by low productivityin the software industry, the inability of the industry to satisfy thepackaged software market, and the closed nature of computer distributionchannels in Japan.andM;DEVELOPMENT TIED TO HARDWAREandM;Software development, except in cases where users develop their own software,is normally closely tied with the manufacturer supplying the hardware, and isordered direct by the manufacturer to the software houses.andM;Both the manufacturers and the users prefer customized products.andO;Manufacturers lock the users into their hardware, while DP managers in clientcompanies rest easy because their bosses are unable to compare their systemswith those of the competitors.andM;The software industry has not really become an independent industry in Japan.andO;Miti is reluctant to talk about the &quot;information services industry,&quot; whichincludes data processing services and so forth.andP;  But PC software aside, thereis simply no Japanese company whose principal business is packaged software.andM;Neither are there many companies which concentrate on subcontracted systemsdevelopment.andP;  The bigger the company, the higher the ratio of sales derivingfrom facility management and hardware.andM;Software houses are virtually all affiliates of computer manufacturers, or ifnot, they are the sections of computing divisions of large users.andP;  Althoughthey are nominally &quot;independent,&quot; the majority reap most of their businessfrom servicing the systems of the parent company.andM;This year's &quot;information services industry's rankings has NTT DataCommunications at the top with revenues of $1.629 billion, which compares toa company like EDs in the U.S.andP;  The company is an offshoot of NTT, which moreor less monopolizes the communications market.andM;In the number two position with sales of $587 million is the Nomura ResearchInstitute, a member of the Nomura Securities group, the largest securitiestrader in the world.andP;  Number three, NBC with results worth $585 million, is aHitachi subsidiary.andM;Only at number four do we find the biggest of the independents, CSK, withsales of $412 million.andP;  However, software development and marketing accountfor only 54% of its figure.andP;  It started out in the facilities managementbusiness, and the segment still nets 20% of its sales.andM;With the current state of affairs in Japan, the thought of exporting softwarecan no longer be a dream.andP;  High salaries, low productivity, a poordevelopment environment, and ordering procedures typical of the closedJapanese distribution system--and, on top of that, the language barrier--makeit imperative.andM;But what conditions would allow Japan to take its place in the world softwaremarket?andM;First is the presence of competitive domestic industries which dearly needadvanced data processing.andP;  Japan presents a unique marketing opportunity tothe software industry because of its powerful manufacturing sector andgrowing service sector.andM;Countries with small domestic markets are unlikely to become exporters, butthis is hardly the case with Japan.andP;  The exporters of programmer labor arenot exporting products and services.andM;The second condition is a situation wherein productivity in the softwareindustry grows to equal, current productivity levels in manufacturingindustries.andP;  The introduction of Case has provided the opportunity.andM;Few observers of the Japanese software scene believe that anything great willcome from the Miti's Software Industrialized Generator and Maintenance Aids(Sigma) project itself.andM;However, everyone involved with computers in Japan recognizes the challengeto improve software development productivity, and the importance of Unix as astandard tool.andP;  The influence of the Sigma campaign on users has beenprofound.andM;In the third condition, the U.S.andP;  software industry would have to fall intostagnation.andP;  If the U.S.andP;  industry loses its leadership position in theinnovation of software production--a position attained by its superiorproductivity--by using low-cost labor, then the Japanese can surely overtakethe U.S.andP;  quickly.andM;In sum, two things could change to create the conditions needed for theJapanese software industry to rise to prominence.andP;  The Japanese softwareindustry could introduce factory production methods to achieve high productquality, high productivity and lower costs.andP;  The U.S.andP;  might then turn tooffshore programming to take advantage of even lower-cost labor.andM;But if the U.S.andP;  does this, it will be unable to bring in innovative newsystems to further improve productivity, and U.S.andP;  companies will be unableto offer interesting positions to creative engineers.andM;Does this sound familiar?andP;  It will be the semiconductor industry all overagain.andM;Until now, the U.S.andP;  software industry has looked like the stratosphere fromthe Japanese perspective.andP;  But the Japanese have little respect for those whorefuse to teach them.andM;The U.S.andP;  computer industry was dealt a grievous blow by the politicalsetting of semiconductor prices by the U.S.andP;  and Japanese governments.andM;In Japan, semiconductors are termed &quot;the rice of industry.&quot;andP;  They arerespected in the way that the people of Japan respect rice as their staplefood.andM;Unfortunately, semiconductors became the object of politically motivatedprotection in the U.S., in the same way that Japanese rice is politicallyprotected.andP;  But what U.S.andP;  industry has to pay for semiconductors is aheavier burden than the cost of rice to the Japanese consumer.andM;CHALLENGE BEGINS IN FACTORIESandM;The Japanese challenge to world software markets will begin in factorysystems, design systems, and will then spread to financial systems and willultimately turn to office systems.andM;Japanese manufacturers are now acting to commercialize products on the basisof their own development programs.andP;  In the case of office systems, thecurrent situation is not encouraging (Japan's detractors say that there areno office systems in Japan), and it will probably take 10 years for packagedsoftware to be as important in the marketplace as it is in the U.S.andP;  today.andM;MEETING FUTURE NEEDSandM;Masahiko Kobayashi, major project development team leader in Miti's Agency ofIndustrial Science and Technology, says that if Japan proceeds as planned toimprove software productivity in the short term, &quot;After 10 years, a Japanesestyle of software will emerge, which will meet fully the needs of thedomestic market.&quot;andM;Kobayashi adds, however, &quot;I have no idea if it will become popular in foreignmarkets.&quot;andM;Certainly, Japanese manufacturers are good at upgrading product quality byconstantly making minor improvements.andP;  This approach has been successful withconsumer products.andP;  But will it work with software?andM;Software development is a field in which originality is needed; success forthe Japanese software industry is a decade away.andP;  The Japanese educationalsystem is too rigid to nurture creative talent.andP;  Further, the Japanese havebecome less diligent than in the past.andP;  Programmer standards in other partsof Asia are consistently better.andM;Thus, given Japan's strength and weakness, the Japanese software industrywill probably appear on the world stage as a combination of Japaneseproduction control systems, Asia's best programmers and the creativity ofU.S.andP;  engineers.andM;The response of the U.S.andP;  software industry will undoubtedly be to move intoJapanese markets rapidly.andP;  The Japanese have five years to become aware ofthese latent forces and act.andM;What might happen in the United States five years hence is a problem.andP;  Butwhatever does happen, it seems certain that the software industry of the '90sand after will be both an international and multinational industry.andM;Kamata is president of Soken Planning, Co., Ltd. of Tokyo, andpublisher/editor of &quot;Corporate Publishing Report: The Newsletter of CorporateElectronic Publishing Systems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
