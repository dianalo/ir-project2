For the first time since joiningthe Supreme Court, Justice Thomas disagreed with AntoninScalia in a case issued on Monday. Critics who have lecturedJustice Thomas that he must reflect a black viewpoint shouldbe happy to see that he cast the only vote against a whiteracist.   More likely, Justice Thomas's critics won't be at allhappy with his dissent in the 42nd case, Dawson v. Delaware.His vote was to enforce a death penalty overruled by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist's 8-1 opinion. Nor was race the keyissue. Justice Thomas's scholarly dissent criticized thecourt for changing the rules on prosecutors by making iteasier for murderers to appeal from death row.</LP><TEXT>   The felon here was David Dawson, who in 1986 escaped aDelaware prison to murder and rob a woman. In thenow-required separate deliberation on whether aggravatingcircumstances outweighed mitigating factors, the jury decidedDawson deserved the death penalty. Dawson's lawyers had citedacts of kindness to his family and membership in AlcoholicsAnonymous as good character traits. The trial judge, citing aline of Supreme Court precedents, barred prosecutors fromtelling the jury about Dawson's swastika tattoos or hisdrawing of a swastika in his jail cell.   The judge did let prosecutors tell jurors that Dawson wasa member of Aryan Brotherhood, a violent and racist prisongang. Chief Justice Rehnquist reversed the death penalty onFirst Amendment grounds, saying that Dawson had a right toassociate with anyone he wanted, including a prison gang,without the jury knowing. He wrote that since the AryanBrotherhood wasn't directly related to the crime, membershipproved &quot;nothing more than Dawson's abstract beliefs.&quot;   But Justice Thomas figured that Aryan Brotherhood mustsignify something. &quot;A jury reasonably could conclude fromDawson's membership in a prison gang that he had engaged insome sort of forbidden activities while in prison,&quot; which hesaid would also &quot;rebut Dawson's attempt to show that he waskind to others.&quot;   Justice Thomas said there was no reason to lay down anexclusionary rule to hide this evidence from jurors. &quot;Jurorsdo not leave their knowledge of the world behind when theyenter a courtroom and they do not need to have the obviousspelled out for them,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The concept of a prisongang is not so mysterious that it requires an encyclopedicdefinition or a greater explanation than any of the otherorganizations to which Dawson belonged, such as AlcoholicsAnonymous.&quot;   The newest justice didn't ridicule his colleagues directlyfor treating prison gangs as just another legitimateassociation. Instead, he cited federal appeals court JudgeFrank Easterbrook in another case that made the same point.   &quot;Surely they do not believe that prison gangs meet everymonth to discuss The Critique of Pure Reason and debate howStanley Tigerman's buildings differ from those of the Bauhausschool,&quot; Justice Thomas wrote, citing Judge Easterbrook.&quot;Gangs affiliate for mutual support, but not the kindcontemplated by the National Labor Relations Act.&quot;   Justice Thomas also pointed out the irony that the courtapproved victim-impact evidence in death penalty cases lastyear in Payne v. Tennessee, but now created a new doublestandard: Lawyers for inmates can cite good associations, butprosecutors can't point out bad ones.   This was not Justice Thomas's first tough stand in aprison case. In a dissent last month, joined only by JusticeScalia, he would have barred a lawsuit by an inmate who,while handcuffed and shackled, was beaten by Louisiana prisonguards.   This caused hyperventilation among liberals. A New YorkTimes editorial called Justice Thomas &quot;the youngest, cruelestjustice.&quot; Columnists managed to find &quot;the outstandingmediocrity of his mind&quot; in this &quot;disgusting dissent&quot; (MaryMcGrory) and lecture &quot;Clarence&quot; that he should do the rightthing because he was picked for his &quot;status as symbol ofAmerica's outsiders&quot; (William Raspberry). These commentariesnotably failed to mention the legal arguments in the case.It's the majority opinion that has the explaining to do.   Sandra O'Connor's opinion in Hudson v. McMillan was guidedby what she called &quot;evolving standards of decency that markthe progress of a maturing society.&quot; When you see evolvingstandards, decency, progress and maturing society all in onesentence, reach for your Constitution. These are code wordsof judicial activism, not part of the Eighth Amendmentprohibition on &quot;cruel and unusual punishment.&quot; The majorityupheld the lawsuit here even though a lower court said theharm to the prisoner -- $800 in &quot;minor injuries,&quot; includingbruises and loosened teeth -- didn't justify a constitutionalclaim.   Justice Thomas's dissent includes no such shadows orpenumbra. &quot;The sole issue in this case, as it comes to us, isa legal one: must a prisoner who claims to have beensubjected to `cruel and unusual punishment' establish at aminimum that he has suffered a significant injury?&quot; JusticeThomas wrote. &quot;A use of force that causes only insignificantharm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it maybe criminal, and it may even be remediable under otherprovisions of the federal Constitution, but it is not `crueland unusual punishment.'&quot;   Justice Thomas reminded the other justices that theFounders intended that the Cruel and Unusual PunishmentClause would apply only to unfairness in the criminalsentence itself. &quot;Surely prison was not a more congenialplace in the early years of the Republic,&quot; Justice Thomaswrote; it wasn't until a 1976 case that the Supreme Courtdecided to apply the clause to a prisoner's complaint about adeprivation in prison. Justice Thomas said the court has now&quot;cut the Eighth Amendment loose from its historicalmoorings.&quot;   As a result, prisoners -- already America's Most Litigiousthanks to free time and free lawyers -- can now sue claimingonly trivial harm. State prisons can expect lawsuits frominmates complaining about everything from the emotionaldistress of double-bunking to balding treatments not offeredby prison health care.   Justice Thomas stressed that the prisoner here could havesued under state law for the beating, but his lawyer wanted aconstitutional case. &quot;Abusive behavior by prison guards isdeplorable conduct that properly evokes outrage andcontempt,&quot; Justice Thomas wrote, &quot;but that does not mean thatit is invariably unconstitutional. The Eighth Amendment isnot, and should not be turned into, a National Code of PrisonRegulation.&quot;   It's not surprising that Justices Scalia and Thomas almostalways reach the same result since they both hew to anoriginal-intent analysis. Whether the result is that an AryanBrother should be taken to meet his Maker or that a beatenprisoner should have sued in state court, Justice Thomasunderstands his job is to reflect the Constitution, notpolitical fashion.</TEXT></DOC>
