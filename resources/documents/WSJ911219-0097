The government's suit, now in trial in federal court inNew York, charges the company with fraudulently inflatingcosts and understating profits on two $167 million ships andthus cheating the government out of $80 million. Thegovernment seeks more than $160 million in penalties.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the huge amount of money involved, the case hasreceived little publicity in recent years as the governmentstruggled to obtain tens of thousands of pages of documentsfrom the company. Beth Kaswan, an assistant U.S. attorneyworking on the case, said that many of the documents were inpoor condition or missing after years in storage.   Explaining the long wait between the filing of theallegations and the start of trial, Ms. Kaswan said, &quot;We'repiecing together a tremendously complex commercial fraud case15 years after the fact.&quot;   The complaint, brought against the defense contractor in1987, alleges that General Dynamics kept two sets of booksfor the building of the ships, which were used to carryliquefied natural gas. One set of books, the governmentclaims, was an accurate portrayal of the company's costs andprofit projections. But the other set of books -- the recordsused to win $80 million in government subsidies -- were basedon widely inflated costs, misleading estimates and illegalkickbacks, the government alleges.   &quot;General Dynamics fabricated an estimate that was designedsolely for the purpose of getting a subsidy,&quot; said NancySavitt, an assistant U.S. attorney, in opening arguments. Thenow-defunct subsidy program was meant to make U.S. companiesmore competitive with foreign ship builders.   The trial, being heard without a jury by federal JudgeKenneth Conboy in Manhattan, opened last week and is expectedto last until the end of January.   General Dynamics says no fraud was committed in connectionwith the ship contracts. Instead, the company's attorneyssay, General Dynamics is being penalized for setting overlyoptimistic goals for its work on the ships. General Dynamicssaid the records that the government alleges were a secretset of books were merely estimates for an operating plan, andnot hard figures reflecting costs and profits on the ships.   &quot;The government would have us turn the art of estimatinginto a science,&quot; said General Dynamics attorney NicholasChabraja in opening statements to the court. &quot;GeneralDynamics' estimating detail was reasonable and consistentwith the facts.&quot;   The contract-fraud case stems from a criminalinvestigation of kickbacks that General Dynamics officialsallegedly received for subcontracting work at the company'sQuincy Shipbuilding division. In the civil suit, thegovernment alleges that the kickbacks inflated by $7 millionthe subsidies that General Dynamics improperly received forbuilding the liquefied natural gas carriers.   General Dynamics wasn't named as a defendant in thatearlier criminal case.   Ms. Savitt, in her opening remarks, said the governmentwill prove that General Dynamics knew that the cost andprofit information that it presented to win the maritimecontracts were false. She said General Dynamics rigged itsbooks to disguise its true profit on the two ships, therebyqualifying for the government subsidy. The subsidy allowed aprofit of only 10% on the ships, but General Dynamics' actualprofit was about three times that amount, she said.   Ms. Savitt said the actual cost and profit records kept bythe company demonstrate &quot;that General Dynamics barely neededa subsidy to be competitive with foreign shipyards.&quot;   But Mr. Chabraja said inaccurate projections account forthe differences in the two sets of records. &quot;This is a case .. . about estimates, not about misrepresentations of existingfact,&quot; he said in court. He added that the numbers that thegovernment claims were a hidden set of books were&quot;notoriously inaccurate&quot; operating plans for the QuincyShipbuilding division.   ---   INJURY CLAIM by husband of a DES daughter is dismissed.   New York's highest court dismissed a lawsuit filed by aNew York man whose wife's mother used DES, ananti-miscarriage drug widely prescribed in the 1950s and1960s. The drug is suspected of causing infertility, cervicalcancers and other health problems in offspring of women whotook it.   In the suit, Clifford Anderson claimed that his wife,Carol, suffered damage to her reproductive abilities fromexposure to DES in her mother's womb. The suit was the firstto reach New York's highest court testing the theory thathusbands can press separate injury claims on grounds of theirso-called loss of consortium, or conjugal relations, andinability to have children.   The New York Court of Appeals ruled in a four-paragraphopinion that husbands cannot bring loss of consortium claimsin New York if the wrongful conduct and the injury occurredprior to marriage.   DES, or diethylstilbestrol, was marketed for about 30years beginning in the 1940s. The drug was often prescribedto reduce the chances of miscarriage, but it was banned in1971 by the Food and Drug Administration after an abnormalincidence of vaginal and cervical cancer appeared indaughters of women who had taken the drug.   Since then, lawsuits by daughters of women who used DEShave been a serious source of liability for the drug'smanufacturers, including the defendants in this case: EliLilly Co., Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,Merck andamp; Co. and Upjohn Co. All the companies have contendedthat exposure to DES caused no serious injury.   Yesterday's decision was the second this year in which NewYork's highest court declined to expand liability to DESmanufacturers over DES-related health problems. Earlier thisyear, the high court rejected liability claims filed by thegrandchild of a woman who took the pregnancy drug.   Stuart Finz, a New York attorney for the Andersons, saidhe and his clients would consider appealing to federal courtson due process grounds but have not yet seen the opinion.Russell H. Beatie Jr., attorney for Eli Lilly and Upjohn,could not be reached for comment.   ---   BAKER andamp; MCKENZIE drops Church of Scientology as client,loses two partners.   Thomas Small and Joan Kupersmith Larkin, partners in Bakerandamp; McKenzie's Los Angeles office who handle intellectualproperty matters for the Scientology church, said the firm'sdecision to drop the client has given them no choice but toresign. Mr. Small and Ms. Larkin said they told management inChicago last month that they will leave with about $2 millionin business.   &quot;We've made a decision to leave,&quot; said Ms. Larkin, &quot;by theend of the firm's fiscal year in June, or as early as six toeight weeks.&quot; The development was first reported in theAmerican Lawyer magazine.   Mr. Small and Ms. Larkin claim that Baker andamp; McKenzie'seight-member executive committee voted to shed itself of thereligious and business organization in June after the firm'slongtime client, Eli Lilly andamp; Co. of Indianapolis, stoppedsending business to the firm. Ms. Larkin linked Eli Lilly'saction to the church's campaign against the anti-depressantdrug Prozac, a Lilly product.   The church claims that Prozac drives people to murder orsuicide, and its accusations have been echoed by plaintiffsin about 100 civil suits now pending, despite a federaladvisory panel's finding this year that the widely used drugdoesn't cause suicidal or violent behavior. Mr. Small said hewas told that Eli Lilly resumed its relationship with Baker andamp;McKenzie after the firm's executive committee voted in Juneto stop representing the church.   Robert Cox, chairman of Baker andamp; McKenzie, disputes theallegation that the church was dropped because of anypressure from Lilly. &quot;Never heard one word from Lilly; notone phone call; not one letter,&quot; he said. Eli Lilly generalcounsel J.B. King did not return phone calls seeking acomment.   There were &quot;umpteen different reasons for dropping thechurch,&quot; said Mr. Cox, including &quot;reports from {firm offices}in various parts of the world about the activities of thechurch&quot; and new accounts of the church's alleged harassmentof its critics. The law firm has 51 offices and 1,600lawyers.   Mr. Cox said the firm has tried to induce Mr. Small andMs. Larkin to stay by offering to let them split acompensation package &quot;equivalent to $1 million in fees&quot; forthe loss of the church as a client and to give them threeyears to find other clients.   Mr. Small and Ms. Larkin have rejected the offer. The LosAngeles partners say they may join another law firm or starttheir own, possibly taking other lawyers from Baker andamp;McKenzie's Los Angeles office. In addition to the Church ofScientology, the two said they represent two movie studios,two magazines and consumer electronic companies -- totaling$2 million of the firm's $478 million revenues in 1990.   Ms. Larkin said that Baker andamp; McKenzie knew about thechurch's activities back in 1988 when she and Mr. Smalljoined the firm. &quot;It's fair to say, in my opinion, that theprofile of the Scientology church has not changed in the lastthree years,&quot; Ms. Larkin said. &quot;It has always been a goodclient.&quot;   ---   A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE ruled against Eastern Air senior debtholders.   The judge found that holders of Eastern Airlines equipmenttrust certificates aren't entitled to any interest paymentsfrom the defunct carrier.   The decision, by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland,also found that senior certificate holders aren't entitled toreceive interest from the collateral at the expense of juniorholders. That means that the most senior holders of the threecertificates won't get preferential treatment, as they'dasked.   The disagreement was over three series of securedequipment trust certificates. Holders of the first seriescertificates argued that they be paid interest on thecollateral. That would have wiped out payments to the secondand third series of certificate holders.   Judge Lifland found that the three series were co-ownersof one secured claim rather than holding three separateclaims.</TEXT></DOC>
