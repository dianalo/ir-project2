(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery's astronauts reportedlyput a spy satellite in orbit Thursday to complete the main task oftheir secret mission before a Thanksgiving meal of irradiatedturkey and freeze-dried vegetables.   There was no official confirmation from NASA or the Pentagon,but sources close to the project said the 2{-ton, $300 millionpayload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay about 10 hoursafter Wednesday's dazzling nighttime liftoff.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thesatellite was capable of monitoring Soviet missile tests andeavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in theSoviet Union and other countries.   They had no information on how well the satellite was operating.A similar satellite was launched by a shuttle crew in 1985.   A military-imposed news blackout surrounding most of the flightwas lifted briefly Thursday evening when NASA announced that theshuttle would land Sunday night at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.   Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said Discovery isscheduled to return to Earth at about 7:02 p.m. PST.   ``The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to performsatisfactorily,'' she said in the brief status report.   The five crew members, meanwhile, continued to whirl around theEarth, their words heard only in secure control centers in Houstonand Sunnyvale, Calif.   Because of the nighttime launch, the astronauts were to haveslept until early afternoon EST, and then were to have celebratedThanksgiving with a feast of turkey, vegetables and cranberry sauce.   With the satellite deployed, the crew could turn attention toexperiments for the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system and othermilitary projects.   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory, and hiscrew is made up of Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and threemission specialists: Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. StoryMusgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.   A blazing 700-foot tail of engine fire illuminated the night asDiscovery darted toward orbit Wednesday. The sky was so clearpeople at the launch site could see the exhaust for 7{ minutes, outto a distance of more than 600 miles.   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,a TV reporter in Miami, 200 miles south of the launch center. ``Itlooked like a Roman candle.''   The shuttle's ascent provided a spectacular view over a largepart of Florida, but clouds obscured the visibility for the rest ofthe Southeast.   It was the third after-dark liftoff in 32 shuttle missions, andthe time was dictated by the secret cargo and its mission.   The satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit22,300 miles above the equator, with line-of-sight to the SovietUnion, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.   The flight is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to themilitary. The Pentagon said the secrecy is necessary to make itmore difficult for the Soviets to track the shuttle and learn itspurpose.</TEXT></DOC>
