In the casedescribed, the residual steam of a salt plant to be utilized has a temperatureof 43/sup 0/C, which is rather low. By the installation of a speciallydesigned brine evaporator it has become possible to use 40% of this residualsteam, which resulted in 5% fuel cost saving for the salt plant of Akzoin Hengelo.</TEXT></DOC>
