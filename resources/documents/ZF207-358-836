(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Mathony, H.-J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A very efficient but little known logic design procedure is thesearch tree algorithm proposed by Thelen (1) for the generation ofall prime implicants of a Boolean function.andP;  Besides thegeneration of prime implicants, Thelen's algorithm can be used tosolve various logic design problems, such as the computation ofprime factors for multilevel logic synthesis (2,3).andP;  In the paperwe present Thelen's algorithm and its application to the problemswhich arise in the logic design of two-level multiple-outputswitching circuits.andP;  We show that the logic minimisationprocedures, such as the expansion of implicants, detection ofessential primes, computation of a minimal cover and reduction ofprime implicants can be reduced to one problem and efficientlysolved by the use of Thelen's algorithm.andP;  Based on these newprocedures we present two heuristic minimisation algorithms, aniterative Espresso-like minimiser and a very fast one-passminimiser, and discuss their results.andP;  Both minimisers differ fromknown algorithms (4, 5, 6, 20) in that minimization is based ononly one fundamental (easily programmable) procedure andminimisation of incompletely specified Boolean functions isperformed without the use of the don't care set.andP;  Because of thelatter aspect, our design algorithms are especially suited for theminimisation of logic functions whose don't care set is largeand-or not explicitly given.andP;  The algorithms have beensuccessfully tested in the design of finite state machines and arepart of the CAD-system CARLOS (7), a logic synthesis system forthe design of multilevel CMOS switching circuits.andP;  (Reprinted bypermission of the publisher.)andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsMathematics of ComputingTheoretical ResearchBoolean AlgebraTree SearchingSwitching TheoryMinimizationHeuristic MethodsProblem SolvingApplicationsDesign.andO;Feature:   illustrationcharttable.andO;Caption:   Search tree for computation of prime implicants.
