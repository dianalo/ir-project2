During the fourth quarter, the top money-center institutions bet heavily that the dollar would decline as it was battered by adverse trade-deficit news that also contributed to the crash, and they reaped substantial fees from trading in currencies for their clients. As a result, foreign exchange profits for nine money centers led by Bankers Trust New York Corp. rocketed 230% in the quarter from a year ago, to $818.6 million, an amount that after taxes would be approximately equal to more than a third of the banks' total net income for the period. Four of the banks, again led by New York-based Bankers Trust, also benefited significantly from the bond-trading rally that followed the stock-market dive. For all the banks, loan losses to securities firms or investors proved minuscule.    The extraordinary gains represented a turnaround from the banks' generally poor performance in the financial markets during the third quarter. The money centers increasingly rely on trading in foreign exchange, bonds and equity securities because earnings growth from traditional lending activities has been sluggish in recent years. Such market-sensitive income accounted for more than half of the money centers' fourth-quarter earnings.    &quot;None of the ten largest banks was belching red ink as a result of the crash,&quot; said Brent Erensel, a securities analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.    The foreign-exchange coup was one of the few brights spots for money-center banks in 1987, their worst year since the Depression. They added about $14 billion to their reserves against losses on Latin American loans and struggled with sluggish loan demand and interest-rate margins. For the year, all reported losses or marginal earnings. Meanwhile, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo andamp; Co., the country's 10th-largest bank, and a host of robust regional banks reported strong operating earnings; nearly 20 regionals now have a higher market capitalization, or total stock value, than some of the money centers.    The split in &quot;core&quot; earnings performance between most of regionals and money centers is expected to continue in 1988. The biggest banks' operating earnings, before one-time gains and tax credits, should show only modest improvement, according to analysts, while many of the large regionals are expected to report double-digit growth from strong loan demand and better cost controls.    Few expect the money centers' stellar fourth-quarter gains in foreign exchange and securities trading to carry through 1988. Such market-sensitive sources of income are highly volatile. &quot;I don't think anyone feels these kinds of revenue gains are sustainable,&quot; said James J. McDermott Jr., research director at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.    Bankers Trust dominated the fourth-quarter market-sensitive income results with $337.7 million in foreign-exchange gains, compared with $71.3 million the third quarter and negligible gains in the year-earlier period. The company also reported $145.5 million in securities-trading profits in the period, about triple the $46.6 million record in the third quarter and more than five times the year-earlier amount.    &quot;Bankers Trust hit the cover off the ball,&quot; said Mr. Erensel.    But analysts said Bankers Trust probably could realize such enormous gains only by taking large risks with its own capital. &quot;If Bankers Trust can make $337 million in foreign exchange, the question arises: Could it lose that much?&quot; observes J. Richard Fredericks, a bank analyst for Montgomery Securities, San Francisco. Several other analysts said they would feel more comfortable if Bankers Trust had settled for lower, but more predictable, fees for hedging customers' accounts rather than betting its own money.    Bankers Trust declined to elaborate on its policies or trading strategy. It has said that extraordinary profits were achieved while &quot;staying within . . . traditional risk policies.&quot;    The other money-center banks also reported 40% to 200% jumps in foreign-exchange gains, led by New York-based Citicorp with $156 million, and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., also in New York, with $89.1 million. Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical New York Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp., all New York banks, joined Bankers Trust in reporting large increases in securities-trading profits. Manufacturers' profits jumped 65% to $28.4 million; Chemical's were up 59% to $26.9 million, and Chase's were up 42% to $32.5 million.    But the other banks didn't report sizable securities-trading profits, and none did well in securities sales. Moreover, both Citicorp and Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp. stumbled in some of their financial-markets ventures. Citicorp's gains on securities sales sank to $6 million in the fourth quarter, down 93% from a year ago. It lost $3 million in securities trading, compared to year-earlier profits of $66 million. The big blow was an estimated $50 million loss in unauthorized trading by a Citicorp officer in Dublin. That episode figured in the dismissal of the head of the Citicorp investment bank for the United Kingdom, Francesco Redi.    In addition, the crash forced Citicorp to pump an extra $5 million in capital into its Vickers da Costa Securities Holdings, a securities firm that operates in the Far East and the U.K.    Security Pacific lost $10.6 million in trading, compared to profit of $46 million in the third quarter and $17.4 million the year before. The losses stemmed from its U.K. securities unit, Hoare Govett Ltd., which held equity securities as a market maker in the London stock market. Those securities plummeted with the crash.    But money-center managers are undeterred by such accidents. With conventional bank lending becoming a no-growth industry, they think their future lies with the financial markets.    &quot;Just because they are more volatile doesn't mean they aren't a good business,&quot; said John F. Kooken, Security Pacific's chief financial officer. &quot;Over time, we think it will be a very profitable business.&quot;    ---                Market Sensitive Income   BankAmerica Corp., Security Pacific Corp., First Chicago Corp. and the six largest New York banks, in millions of dollars                                                 Percentage                     4th Q.     3rd Q.    4th Q.
