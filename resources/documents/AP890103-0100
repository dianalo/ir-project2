LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens complained Tuesdaythat European nations were making Middle East peace moves withoutconsulting Israel, and he said his nation was willing to sufferisolation in the world for its own security.   Four members of Israel's parliament, meanwhile, planned to defyIsraeli law and meet with officials of the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, three Palestinians werereported wounded in clashes with soldiers, and troops demolished orsealed three houses of Arabs suspected of attacks on soldiers orArabs cooperating with Israeli authorities.   Three residents of Gaza's Jabalya refugee camp were sentenced to14 years in prison each for throwing firebombs, taking part in riotsor belonging to groups organizing the nearly 13-month-oldPalestinian uprising, the army said.   Arens, in his first news conference with foreign reporters,criticized the U.S. decision to hold talks with the PLO. Heemphasized that negotiating with the PLO could not further the peaceprocess, but he refused to outline Israel's plans for reaching peacewith the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors.   Arens said Israel does not approve of the European Community'splan, announced Monday, to start a Middle East peace initiative byencouraging an international conference on the region.   ``I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind ofintitiative, the members of the European Community were to meet withus,'' he said. ``I think there is probably no reason why Europeancountries should not listen with considerable attention to ouropinions, to our feelings.''   Arens, 63, became foreign minister with the formation of Israel'snew government Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud bloc of PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, which has opposed an international MiddleEast peace conference.   Arens, a former ambassador to Washington, also criticized theU.S. talks with the PLO, saying: ``We are concerned that thisdecision might impair our ability to fight the plague ofinternational terrorism.''   Asked if Israel felt isolated by the Europeans and the UnitedStates, Arens said his government does not welcome isolation butwill accept it if necessary for its security.   ``We should not be expected to take any step that might decreasethe sense of isolation ... if they are steps that would endanger thestate of Israel,'' he said.   Also Tuesday, an Israeli legislator said he and three colleaguesplan to attend a European symposium on the Middle East, defying aban on meetings with PLO officials.   ``We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peacewith them through compromise,'' said legislator Lova Eliav. ``Ourgeneration must speak to the Palestinian leadership, and thePalestinian leadership is the PLO.''   Those attending the meeting in Paris on Jan. 12-13 include Eliavand Ora Namir of the mainstream Labor Party, Yair Tsaban of thesocialist Mapam Party, and Shulamit Aloni of the left-wing CitizensRights Movement.   The PLO is banned in Israel and meetings with its members areillegal, but the four legislators have parliamentary immunity.   Recent opinion polls show a majority of Israelis support talkswith the PLO.   In Jabalya, soldiers demolished one Palestinian home and sealedparts of two others after arresting residents suspected of attackson Israeli soldiers or Arabs cooperating with Israel, the army said.   The action against the Arab homes came Monday night, after twoother Palestinian houses were demolished earlier in the day.   The army statement announcing the sentencing of threePalestinians to prison said that all three were from the Jabalyacamp but that house demolitions were not tied to their cases.   The moves against Palestinian houses seem to be part of astepped-up campaign to try to halt the Palestinian uprising againstIsrael's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Israel also deported 13 Palestinians on Sunday. The InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross on Tuesday appealed to Israel to stopsuch deportations, saying they violated international law.   In the West Bank, soldiers shot and wounded three Palestiniansduring clashes with stone-throwing youths in the towns of Ramallahand Tulkarem, Arab news reports said. One of the victims was an8-year-old boy shot in the back, a hospital official said. The armysaid it was checking reports of injuries.   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 345Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died in violence.</TEXT></DOC>
