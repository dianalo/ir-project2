MR demonstrated unequivocal shunt patency in 23 casesand stenotic shunts in three cases and failed to visualize the shuntsin three cases. MR, which allows direct visualization of the shunts asopposed to indirect evidence of shunt patency by superior mesentericartery/celia angiography, was superior in demonstrating shunt patencyin two cases. Causes of nondiagnostic studies are discussed. The authorsconclude that MR is the procedure of choice for assessment of portosystemicshunts in the early postoperative period, for follow-up, and in the symptomaticpatient. Angiography should be reserved for the preoperative assessmentof those patients in whom shunt closure is suspected by MR.</TEXT></DOC>
