The No. 2 U.S. auto maker said it has been holding private discussions &quot;during the past several months with many South African labor and community leaders&quot; regarding its 42% stake in South African Motor Corp. Samcor, as the South African company is known, is majority-owned by Anglo-American Corp., the giant South African conglomerate.    In a statement issued yesterday, Ford portrayed its goal as seeking an alternative to a total pull-out from South Africa, which it contended would harm the employees, about 70% of whom are black.    A Ford spokesman said it isn't clear how much of Ford's stake would be donated to the trust, but that &quot;it could amount to about a quarter of the company.&quot; Ford might retain the rest of its shares, or &quot;other solutions could be worked out,&quot; he said. He didn't elaborate.    At last month's annual meeting, &quot;Chairman Donald E. Petersen pointed out that total withdrawal -- including termination of component-supply and trademark licensing -- would result in closure of Samcor and unemployment of 16,000 Samcor and dealer employees,&quot; the company said. At the meeting, Ford shareholders voted against resolutions calling for the company's total withdrawal from South Africa.    Nonetheless, South African union officials are concerned about whether reduced involvement by Ford would impair Samcor's viability.    The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, which includes auto workers, is said to be balking at Ford's proposal to transfer part of its holding. The union is concerned that once Ford loosens its ties, Samcor may have difficulty competing in South Africa's overcrowded auto industry. It also questions whether the company would pay significant dividends to make the shareholdings worthwhile. Instead, the union prefers longer-term compensation, such as one to five years' worth of wages, based on length of service, and assurances that pensions will still be honored.    South Africa's auto workers are highly sensitive to disinvestment moves. In 1985, Ford shut down its operations in Port Elizabeth, leaving several thousand workers jobless. Despite generous severance payments, the Ford employees felt betrayed. Ford's resulting joint venture in Samcor is based in Pretoria.    When General Motors Corp., the No. 1 U.S. auto maker, announced its disinvestment last October, 2,000 workers at its Port Elizabeth operations went on strike for several weeks. They also were demanding compensation in case the company, sold to local owners, went under.    In an apparent acknowledgment of those concerns, Ford said yesterday that it expects the deliberations to take time. &quot;Because what we are doing is unique, the labor and community leaders need time to consider the options and they have a strong desire to deliberate in private,&quot; L. Lindsey Halstead, a Ford vice president, said in a statement. &quot;In deference to their wishes, we expect to comment no further until that process has been completed.&quot;    Samcor officials in South Africa have refused comment on Ford's plans.    GM's withdrawal from South Africa last year prompted a string of other major American corporations to pull out from the racially troubled nation. Since then, questions about whether withdrawal really helps South African blacks have been raised.    But earlier this month, the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, a black Baptist minister and GM director who is a leading opponent of apartheid, called for U.S. companies to leave South Africa. For 10 years Mr. Sullivan had sought to defeat the system of racial segregation in South Africa by urging American corporations there to adhere to his &quot;Sullivan Principles&quot; of fair employment. But conceding that that approach has failed, he called for a full exodus and trade sanctions.    Fifty U.S. companies pulled out of South Africa last year, and 33 have completed or announced pullout plans so far this year, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center. Emhart Corp. and PepsiCo Inc., for instance, announced plans earlier this year to sell their remaining South African operations. About 200 U.S. companies are still doing business in South Africa.    Randall Robinson of TransAfrica, a black lobbying group on Africa and the Caribbean and a leader of the divestment movement, wouldn't comment specifically on Ford's announcement. He did say, however, that &quot;if a company leaving South Africa can finance a purchase by whites, it can also finance purchase by blacks. We continue to maintain that divestment should occur in a manner acceptable to black unions and black workers.&quot;    ---   Roger Thurow in Johannesburg contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
