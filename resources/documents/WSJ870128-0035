The doctor, fearful that the cash-strapped utility would default on the bill, demanded cash payment upon inoculation.    &quot;They won't even trust us for $150,&quot; says E. Linn Draper, Gulf States president and chief executive officer.    That a country doctor in southern Texas would dismiss one of the area's largest corporations as a deadbeat illustrates not only the mounting cash problems at Gulf States but also the success of the utility's efforts to publicize its financial woes.    With $182 million of emergency rate relief on the line, Gulf States has lately led a slick and expensive public-relations campaign to promote itself as a candidate for the first Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing by an investor-owned utility since the Great Depression. In doing so, it is engaged in a delicate balancing act. While trying to persuade tight-fisted rate makers of its financial peril, the company has worsened its problems by striking fear among its suppliers and others.    In the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Gulf States had net income of $269 million, or $1.96 per share, on revenue of $1.5 billion. But those figures don't tell the entire story.    An accounting trick, used only for utilities, provides the vexing illusion of cash profits where there are none. The accounting rule allows utilities to treat plant construction costs as income on the premise that costs will be recouped through rate increases. Mr. Draper says that without the accounting technique, known as allowance for funds used during construction, the utility would have shown a net loss.    The cause of Gulf States' present predicament is its $4.4 billion River Bend nuclear plant, which began full operation last June along a Mississippi River bend in Louisiana.    As a result of lingering consumer resentment that the expensive nuclear plant was built in the first place, Gulf States has yet to get the vast majority of River Bend included in its rate base. A partial ruling from a Louisiana state district court may come as early as this week on the company's previously denied request for $100 million in emergency relief. In Texas, the company is pleading not only for $82 million of immediate rate increases, but it still faces a crucial ruling over the &quot;prudency&quot; of its decision to build the plant -- the nation's third-most costly.    Also, Gulf States has two rate requests, totaling $164 million, for permanent relief in Texas and Louisiana. The Texas rate and &quot;prudency&quot; cases both start in early March.    And River Bend itself is now getting a double take from the Nuclear Reglatory Commission. The NRC has written Gulf States to express strong concern over whether cash shortages are impairing safety measures at the plant. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Gulf States interprets the NRC's concerns to mean that River Bend's operation license could be suspended.    Gulf States joins a long list of major utilities whose solvency has been thrust into doubt over nuclear plants. Most notably, New Orleans-based Middle South Utilities Inc., which like Gulf States serves the huge petrochemical corridor of the Gulf Coast, recently averted financial failure by receiving last-minute rate increases for its huge Grand Gulf plant. Wall Street analysts are encouraged that the judge reviewing the pending Gulf States' request in Louisiana is the same one who ruled in late 1985 that Louisiana regulators should let a Middle South unit pass on a portion of its costs.    What distinguishes Gulf States from other struggling nuclear utilities is the larding of its reputation with bad publicity. Only months ago, the utility was angrily denying rumors of bankruptcy-law filing and damning as &quot;silly, stupid and irresponsible&quot; the vigorous suggestion by Louisiana's attorney general that seeking protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 was an attractive alternative to higher utility rates.    Now, the company is paying $1.5 million to a public-relations firm in Arlington, Va., which has adopted such high-technology techniques as polling customers and blanketing the region with Western Union Mailgrams. &quot;The clock is ticking,&quot; began one Mailgram.    &quot;We think our situation is desperate,&quot; Gulf States' Mr. Draper, a former nuclear-engineering professor, says to critics of the public-relations campaign, &quot;and it is in the best interests of Texas and Louisiana that we survive.&quot; In any case, the money spent to spread the gloomy message would equal little more than a day's operating expenses.    But the message is provoking unwelcome demands for cash up front by big and little suppliers fearful that Gulf States will go belly up. When the lowest bidder on a maintenance contract demanded cash on delivery, the company had to pay $55,000 extra by turning to the next bidder. And Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit wants Gulf States to pay for natural gas in advance.    A merger attempt, guided by investment bankers at Salomon Brothers Inc., fell through in December with Central andamp; South West Corp., a Dallas-based utility holding company. And even Gulf States' banks are beginning to get tough. This month, a group led by Irving Trust Co. cut off the utility's $800 million revolving credit facility at the current borrowing level of $350 million. And 27 other banks have canceled credit lines totalling about $131 million.    The suggestion by regulators that Gulf States sell high-interest junk bonds is scoffed at. Joseph Donnelly, chief financial officer, told Texas regulators that such a move would be irresponsible because of the improbability of debt repayment. &quot;That amounts to something like the fleecing of the guy you're dealing with,&quot; Mr. Donnelly said at a hearing in the state capital, Austin, two weeks ago.    Gulf States has assured regulators it has done everything possible to cut costs -- &quot;to squeeze the last squeal out of the pig,&quot; as Mr. Donnelly told Texas regulators.    Cost savings have included $54 million from two omissions of the common-stock dividend, with a third omission expected in February; cutting 177 jobs; early-retirement offerings, and salary freezes for all employees, including top management and 3,000 unionized workers. The freezes don't apply to promotions, such as Mr. Draper's to the additional post of chief executive, which raised his salary to $300,000 from $200,000. Mr. Draper, however, points out that his predecessor, Paul W. Murrill, who remains chairman, took about a $100,000 salary cut.    While the results of Gulf States' campaign remain to be seen, it is also arousing the company's easily aroused critics. To Gulf States' entire tale of woe, Joyce Roddy, an indefatigable consumer advocate, says, &quot;Malarkey.&quot;    Mrs. Roddy, a disabled nurse in Port Arthur, Texas, where unemployment is near 18%, says the region simply can't afford higher utility rates because of the &quot;mistake&quot; of building River Bend. As a solution, Mrs. Roddy proposes that community leaders start a not-for-profit electricity co-op.    Mrs. Roddy -- who calls herself a &quot;dumb RN,&quot; her friends &quot;sugarplum&quot; and enemies &quot;you sucker&quot; -- cultivates blue-collar opposition to Gulf States with her folksy charm. Soon after she had a heart attack in December, she was on television berating Gulf States. Last autumn, Mrs. Roddy drew a representative of consumer advocate Ralph Nader to a Port Arthur rally. Not to be outdone, Gulf States held a counter-news conference outside the Port Arthur Civic Center, where the public meeting was held.    On top of such protests, Gulf States faces opposition from industrialists who have organized into coalitions of their own. The industrialists' solution to higher utility rates has been cogeneration plants, which produce electricity more cheaply. Cogeneration has become so popular that it contributed to an 11% drop in Gulf States' industrial-customer base in 1986. Next month, Du Pont, Gulf States' largest industrial customer, is scheduled to begin operating its own cogeneration plant, capable of producing 80% of its power needs.    Gulf States' shrinking service base has caused Austin attorney Jim Boyle to spin out a &quot;death spiral&quot; scenario for Gulf States. The former head of Texas's consumer-oriented Office of Public Utility Counsel, Mr. Boyle represents several cities opposing higher utility bills.    According to Mr. Boyle's theory, as utility rates rise, the customer base shrinks. Industrial and commercial users will look for cheaper energy forms, such as cogeneration, thus reducing the population of customers available to cover the utility's costs. &quot;If the company got what it wanted, it would sign its death warrant,&quot; he says.    On Wall Street, the utility has no shortage of analysts supporting the rate-increase requests -- and defending Gulf States' decision to build the nuclear plant. Though he considers the company's use of the Chapter 11 specter as &quot;theatrics,&quot; Gary Hovis of Argus Research defends the company's decision to go ahead with the facility. &quot;When they decided to build River Bend eight years ago, oil was $38 a barrel,&quot; he says. &quot;If the head man then had decided not to do that, he would've been fired on the spot. Now all the trendy-cause people and the regulators are saying it was a bad decision.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
