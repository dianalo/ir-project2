PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Andrei D. Sakharov, in the speech he was writingwhen he died, said legislation allowing prosecutors to prolongmaximum pre-trial detention threatened society with a return toStalinist times, a report said.   The respected weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, in its Dec. 27editions, published a text of the speech that it said the NobelPeace Prize winner was working on when he collapsed and died in hisstudy Dec. 14.   Other Soviet publications have said a text of the final speechof Sakharov was circulated last weekend at the Congress of People'sDeputies, where Sakharov would have given the speech, but they havenot published it.   Literaturnaya Gazeta did not say how it obtained the text.   Sakharov said that by trying to lengthen the amount of timeSoviets can be held before trial, the procurator general's officewas trying to ``free its hands entirely and return the country tothe stormy times of illegality of the cult of personality,stagnation and other rather gloomy periods.''   The ``cult of personality'' is a reference to the rule of JosefStalin, during which prosecutors unencumbered by legal tradition orjudicial oversight had all of Stalin's potential opponents and manyother Soviets imprisoned or killed.   The maximum length of time a suspect may be held has been ninemonths, after which only the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet couldprolong detention.   The new law allows the deputy procurator general to extend suchdetention to one year, and for the country's top prosecutor toextend it to 18 months.   For decades prisoners in the Soviet Union have had no access toa lawyer during most of their pre-trial detention.   Soviet practice has been to allow the presence of a defenselawyer to prepare for trial only after the prosecutor has finishedquestioning the suspect and building his case.   ``This will not improve the results of the war with crime, butonly make our already sick society more cruel,'' Sakharov's textsaid. ``The whole country will justly see a new lie in the newlaw.''   Sakharov cited the laws of many Western countries limiting theamount of time suspects can be held without trial.   He criticized Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov for what hesaid were irregularities in conducting the Supreme Sovietlegislative session Nov. 28 at which the new law was approved.   Sakharov, 68, was elected to the Congress of People's Deputiesin March, and during the Congress session earlier on Dec. 14 hadspoken out in favor of declaring a group of reform-minded deputiesa ``political opposition'' to the Communist Party and government.</TEXT></DOC>
