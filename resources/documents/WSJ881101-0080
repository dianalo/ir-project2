Yesterday's decision by Britain's Appeal Court upholds a lower court ruling and gives Wellcome PLC a major victory in the high-stakes market for genetically engineered drugs. The American and British biotechnology concerns locked legal horns over whether Genentech's patent for TPA also covered Wellcome's form of the clot-dissolving agent. The battle began after Genentech in 1986 won a U.K. patent for TPA. Wellcome, whose version of the drug isn't yet on the market, challenged that patent and the subsequent U.S. patent granted Genentech earlier this year. The legal battle over the U.S. patent is pending in federal court, Wilmington, Del.    In South San Francisco, Genentech said it hadn't decided whether to appeal the ruling to the House of Lords, the U.K.'s highest court. But analysts said a reversal seems unlikely following defeats in two lower courts.    The company also said it didn't believe the British decision will have any impact on its TPA patent in the U.S. The company said &quot;a decision rendered in the U.K. is not binding on nor would it serve as precedent before a U.S. court.&quot; It also noted that &quot;the U.S. patent office was aware of the existence of the British lower court decision at the time it issued Genentech's recombinant TPA patent.&quot;    Nevertheless, the decision could be viewed in the U.S. as a bellwether in the murky and comparatively scant field of biotech patent law. &quot;Even if it isn't a jurisdictional precedent (in the U.S.),&quot; said Samuel Isaly, a drug-industry analyst with S.G. Warburg in New York, &quot;it's going to be a psychological precedent to investors who don't have a strong conviction yet that the U.S. patent holds.&quot;    The decision could also make it tougher for biotech firms to win broad patents in Europe.    Separately, Genentech said its foreign licensee, Boehringer Ingelheim International G.m.b.H., received approval from U.K. authorities to market Genentech's version of TPA in the U.K. Genentech receives royalties from Boehringer for overseas sales. A Genentech spokesman declined to estimate what sales would be in the U.K.    Denise Gilbert, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said the separate go-ahead Genentech received for U.K. sales, because of the licensing agreement, isn't a major factor. She added that &quot;most people expected them to lose the appeal.&quot;    Genentech shares closed yesterday at $14.625, off 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On London's Stock Exchange, Wellcome traded late yesterday at 481 pence, down six pence.    The three-judge appellate panel's ruling comes just two weeks after Genentech halted production of TPA for the balance of 1988 amid a serious sales slump and inventory buildup. The drug has failed to meet U.S. sales forecasts of $400 million this year, surprising Wall Street and battering the company's shares.    A spokesman for London-based Wellcome said the company expects to seek approval to sell its version of TPA by next June, initially in the U.S. A Genentech spokesman said it would be &quot;premature&quot; to address what steps it might take if Wellcome sought to begin U.S. sales of its version of the drug.    Montgomery Securities' Ms. Gilbert noted that she expects it will take about 18 months from the date of filing for Wellcome to get approval for sale of its TPA in this country; she added that the Wellcome TPA &quot;is just one of a long list of competitive products that Genentech's TPA is going to have to face&quot; in coming years.    The patent dispute arose because TPA, like many biotechnology products, occurs naturally in the human body and long has been known to scientists. Both Genentech and Wellcome use modern genetic techniques to coax microorganisms into producing the chemical in a pure, abundant form. But in addition to claiming rights to its gene-splicing process, Genentech added a patent claim for TPA itself when made by any genetic process.    The U.K. Appeal Court judges struck down this claim as overly broad in three separate opinions. Genentech's TPA claim &quot;is not a patentable invention within the terms&quot; of British law even though its research was &quot;crucial to the commercial target which was in everyone's sights,&quot; concluded Lord Justice Francis Purchas.    Lord Justice Purchas hinted that Genentech might have won a patent for a narrow claim dealing with plasmid, the particle used to splice TPA-producing genes into cell cultures used to make the protein. But plasmids represent &quot;such a small part of the technology that (it) wouldn't necessarily block Wellcome from competing with a similar compound,&quot; observed Jonathan de Pass, an analyst with London brokers Robert Fleming Securities Ltd.    If upheld, the decision may prompt biotech companies in Britain to avoid broad patent claims -- which the firms have based on their novel technology and high research costs. Because of similarities between British and European patent law, it may influence biotechnology companies on the Continent as well.    Narrower patent claims could &quot;make their patents less commercially viable&quot; and &quot;restrict the profitability of the new products they are bringing out,&quot; said Arnab Banerji, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in London. The ruling also could lead the European Community Commission to revamp patent law in order to protect fruits of biotechnology research better, some patent experts said.    The case in Britain drew extensive attention in the pharmaceutical industry world-wide because it was the first patent dispute over genetically engineered products to go to trial.
