The appeals court, however, reduced the size of the payment to 2.5 billion Indian rupees ($192 million) from 3.5 billion rupees. The Danbury, Conn.-based chemical manufacturer has $200 million in insurance coverage for the accident.    Carbide continued to dispute the payment, claiming that it amounts to &quot;a judgment and decree without trial.&quot; A spokesman said attorneys are reviewing the new ruling and may appeal it to the Supreme Court of India.    The lower court ordered the payment last December after Carbide and the Indian government failed to reach an out-of-court settlement to compensate the victims. Carbide's offer in March 1986 to establish a fund of about $500 million was turned down by the government. Both sides are now preparing for a trial, which is expected to be lengthy.    While Carbide has assumed &quot;moral&quot; responsibility for the disaster and has paid $5 million to the Indian Red Cross, the company claims the disaster was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled employee. The government, claiming negligence by Carbide, is seeking $3 billion in damages. According to the government's estimates, more than 2,800 people were killed and as many as 40,000 injured when poison gas leaked from a Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal. </TEXT></DOC>
