The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars told theSenate Judiciary Committee they supported President Bush's positionthat a constitutional amendment was the only way to overcome theSupreme Court ruling that made flag burning a legally protected formof expression.   The testimony came a day after the House sent the flag issue backto the Senate by approving its bill outlawing flag burning by a380-38 margin.   ``We believe the only ironclad way to protect our flag is througha constitutional amendment,'' said Walter G. Hogan, the VFW'scommander-in-chief. Whether any regular statute could pass musterwith the court was doubtful, he said.   Leaders of the Vietnam Veterans of America and the ParalyzedVeterans of America said, however, they thought a statute could betried first, before tinkering with the Constitution.   ``Our members share the `fury factor' with other Americans onthis subject, but they are unprepared to sacrifice free speech inthe process of assuring that flag desecration is properlypunished,'' said Mary R. Stout, national president of the Vietnamveterans group.   Democrats after Tuesday's House vote that passage of the statutemight weaken the push for a similar constitutional amendment, butBush and others vowed to fight for their politically more stridentapproach.   ``I think there are probably enough members now that will voteagainst a constitutional amendment that they won't be able to getthe two-thirds required by the Constitution to pass one,'' said Rep.Mike Synar, D-Okla.   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,said a constitutional amendment is not necessary to many citizensand lawmakers who want to protect the flag.   ``If a statute will do it, fine,'' he said.   However, Bush and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill contend thata law cannot overcome the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in June thatburning the flag is a form of free speech protected by theConstitution.   Many Democrats say a constitutional amendment would tinkerdangerously with the Bill of Rights.   Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, predicted thenew version would be approved by the court because it would outlawthe act of flag-mutilation and not the intent of the offender.   Republicans, however, say courts would quickly strike it downagain.   ``We believe that this bill is insufficient to provide theprotections that we seek, and therefore continue to press for aconstitutional amendment,'' said White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater.   ``This bill is flatly unconstitutional,'' said Rep. JamesSensenbrenner, R-Wis. ``So all passing this bill has done is delay avote on a constitutional amendment to protect the flag fromburning,'' he said, acknowledging he was disappointed that only 21Republicans joined him in voting against it.   Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., complained that the Democratic billwas a sham. ``This is the flag-burner protection act of 1989,'' hesaid.   The bill sets penalties of up to a year in jail plus a fine foranyone who knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, or tramples upon aU.S. flag. It makes an exception for orderly disposal of worn-outflags, which is usually carried out by veterans groups by burning.   The legislation, sent to the Senate, also sets a procedure forexpedited court review of its constitutionality the next time afederal flag-burning case comes along.   But the Capitol Hill showdown on the constitutional amendmentprobably will come before the statute, if enacted, is ever tested.   To help gain Republican votes for the statute, House SpeakerThomas S. Foley, D-Wash., promised supporters of the constitutionalamendment the House will vote on the proposed amendment after theSenate acts in October.   Foley denied that scheduling a vote on the amendment _ a votewhich it appeared earlier he intended to block _ was anacknowledgement that the Democratic strategy was losing.   ``It might be taken exactly the opposite way,'' he said, as``confidence (in) a vote to reject a constitutional amendment.''   Foley said the House Democratic leadership still believes aconstitutional amendment is unnecessary and such action should beavoided ``particularly in the sensitive area of the FirstAmendment.''   Bush's presidential campaign included a stop at a flag factory,and GOP leaders consider the flag burning question a ``wedge issue''which helps break apart Democratic electoral strength.</TEXT></DOC>
