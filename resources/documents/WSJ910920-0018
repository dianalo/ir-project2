Unlike deposits at banks, which are protected by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., holders of insurancepolicies are covered by a patchwork of funds called guarantyfunds. The guaranty funds have come under fire, however,after a series of insurance company failures raised questionsabout the differences in coverage from state to state and thefunds' ability to handle large insolvencies.</LP><TEXT>   At a meeting this week of the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners in Pittsburgh, regulators agreed tobegin looking at ways to beef up the funds. &quot;There are somelegitimate points of criticism about the funds,&quot; said EarlPomeroy, commissioner of insurance in North Dakota andchairman of the committee that is looking into changes in thesystem. &quot;Policyholders have different levels of protection,depending on the state they live in. Is that fair?&quot;   Regulators have been talking informally about the issuefor some time, but in coming months, Mr. Pomeroy said, theywill be meeting to consider taking action on adopting uniformcoverage for policyholders. Regulators are also looking atways to improve coordination among the funds during largeinsolvencies.   One of the ideas under consideration is for states toadopt the association's model regulation for guaranty funds,which provides coverage of $300,000 in death benefits,$100,000 in individual annuities and $100,000 in cash values.Group annuities, such as guaranteed investment contracts,would be covered up to $5 million.   Such a standard would increase the current level ofcoverage in scores of states. Only policyholders in Maryland,which covers all obligations of insurers in the state, wouldhave their coverage lowered under the scenario.   Guaranty funds are administered by industry-runassociations and funded by the industry. State insuranceregulators have authority over the funds, however. One waythe association may encourage regulators to adopt uniformrules for funds would be to use an existing program in whichstate insurance commissioners who don't adopt theassociation's model acts by 1994 would sacrifice someauthority over insurers in their states.   Also under consideration are measures that would shore upthe financing of the funds. &quot;If there was a series ofinsolvencies, the capacity of some state funds could betaxed,&quot; said Robert Klein, director of research at theassociation. To help solve the problem, regulators areconsidering the idea of setting up a reserve fund, he said,that could be tapped if one of the state funds exhausts itscapacity.   The efforts by regulators to improve the safety net forpolicyholders come amid calls from lawmakers for improvementsin the insurance funds. For example, a bill authored by Sen.Howard Metzenbaum, (D., Ohio) that would put in place federalregulation of the insurance industry would also replace thestate system of guaranty funds with a national fundadministered by the insurance industry.   Meanwhile, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, (D., Texas) introduceda bill recently that would allow insurers to tap the discountwindow at the Federal Reserve should a run by policyholdersdevelop. Concern about such an event has risen afterpolicyholders of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. lined upto cash in their policies before its seizure by regulators.   As a result, the insurance industry and regulators havebeen scrambling to come up with proposals that they hope willhelp forestall action by lawmakers. Some life insurers areconsidering, for example, setting up a liquidity fund thatother insurers could tap during a run by policyholders.   &quot;It's a microstep, but at least they are responding towhat's happening on the national level,&quot; said Linda Lipsen,legislative counsel to the Consumers Union, publisher ofConsumer Reports.   At the moment, regulators are not considering a nationalfund to replace the state system of funds. Indeed, Mr.Pomeroy stressed that the association believes that, despitetheir weaknesses, the guaranty funds are the best system forprotecting policyholders.   If regulators choose to adopt the current model forguaranty funds, it could provide additional coverage in manystates of group annuities, such as guaranteed investmentcontracts. Those instruments are fixed-rate contracts sold byinsurers to pension funds.   Currently, the contracts are covered in only a handful ofstates. Under the association's model, the contracts would becovered up to $5 million for each holder. Even that coveragewould provide little protection for most holders, however,since most contracts are much larger than that.   Mr. Klein said such a rule would encourage pensionmanagers to diversify their guaranteed investment contractportfolios, a trend that has already taken hold at manycompanies. He added that regulators would consider increasingthe coverage but that there was little support among insurersand regulators for the idea.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          INSURANCE POLICYHOLDERS in several states, including NewYork, Washington and Maryland, would have their coverage frominsurance funds lowered under a uniform guaranty fund planbeing considered by state regulators. Friday's editionincorrectly stated that only policyholders in Maryland wouldhave their coverage lowered under such a plan.   (WSJ Sept. 25, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
