The democracies, freed for the moment from pressing economicconcerns of their own, pledged to address the environmental problemsthat threaten the planet and focused on aiding the falteringeconomies of the communist bloc and the Third World.   The seven leaders endorsed a significant strategic switch in theway rich countries should wrestle to resolve the Third World'sstaggering $1.3 trillion debt.   They pledged economic and food assistance to Eastern Europe, andgave a distant embrace to the unsolicited call by Mikhail Gorbachevfor a greater Soviet role in the global economies.   The environmental discussions prompted President Bush to describethe meetings as a ``watershed'' event.   For the first time, the administrator of the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, William Reilly, participated _ symoblizing Bush'sinterest in a worldwide campaign to protect the ozone layer, saveforests and combat global warming.   Bush said the summit generalities would be backed up by specificrecommendations when he hosts next year's summit in the UnitedStates.   Still, the cautious approach taken here raised some questionswhether the good intentions might go for naught.   Skeptical environmental activists may have in mind the conflictof rhetoric and action among summit partners on the subject ofterrorism over the years.   In London in 1984, the summiteers first went on record againstterrorism. It was a strongly worded declaration but a general one.   Three years ago in Tokyo, the campaign led by the United Statespicked up steam and got specific.   The leaders were nudged into shaking off their resistance tonaming names and branded Libya a supporter of terrorism. Theyproposed such ``maximum efforts'' as an arms embargo against suchnations as well as improved extradition procedures.   And yet, France recently delivered to Libya spare parts forMirage jet fighters paid for long ago. And West German firmsassisted Libya in developing a plant near Tripoli to producechemical weapons.   Such contradictions notwithstanding, one Western official,attending his sixth summit, rejected a suggestion that summitsproduce only words. This veteran diplomat insisted: ``Diplomacy islanguage, and you keep jacking up the language gradually andprogressively.''   As it turned out, except for what Secretary of State James A.Baker III termed ``a little debate'' over an internationalconference on Poland and Hungary to be held later this summer, therewas no evidence of discord.   That sped the summit to an early conclusion.   Baker, who has been to nine such sessions, called this year's``the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that Ihave attended.''   Bush, at his post-summit news conference Sunday, said ``it wentsmoothly.'' He was not sorry to have the summit end early,acknowledging that after a four-day visit to Hungary and Polandbefore participating in French bicentennial festivities and thesummit meetings, he was ``running out of gas.''   Are these annual summits worthwhile?   Most of those who participate are inclined to believe their timewas well-spent.   Taizo Watanabe, the Japanese spokesman, stressed the unstructurednature of summit meetings as helpful in coordinating policy amongthe seven nations.   ``This is something we could not find anywhere else,'' he said.   Helmut Haussmann, the West German economics minister, was morephilosophical. ``Those who attend summits think they are veryimportant as long as they are active participants,'' he said. ``Whenthey no longer participate they no longer think they are important.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid, chief of the AP's State Departmentstaff, is covering his fifth summit of the world's richest nations.</TEXT></DOC>
