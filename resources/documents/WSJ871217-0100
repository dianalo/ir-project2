And if I am for myself only, what am I? And if not now, when?&quot; -- Hillel the Elder.    Somebody must have distracted the President on Monday. He signed the extension of the Ethics in Government Act. He had promised to veto it, and indeed, his accompanying statement admitted &quot;the extraordinary step of signing the bill despite my very strong doubts about its constitutionality.&quot;    For Ethics in Government Act, we read Hypocrisy in Government Act. Congress sets up the whole apparatus of special prosecutors and such to bedevil the executive branch, but refuses to apply the same standards to itself. Ursula Meese was once investigated for possible insider trading on 200 shares, but House Speaker Jim Wright remains uninvestigated for supporting a $11.8 million federal grant to his business partner's development in Fort Worth. Ollie North faces years of court appearances for carrying out the President's foreign policy, while Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain is unpunished after the Ethics Committee ruled that he broke House rules by accepting transportation from a savings and loan. Undermining the executive is what the whole act is about, and in the current version Congress has naturally made it worse.    President Reagan's signing was a profile in the Beltway mentality. We understand that some of the President's staffers feared that Ronald Reagan's critics would say he was vetoing the special-prosecutor law merely to save his friends. One of the Reagans' friends, Michael Deaver, was convicted yesterday of perjury charges brought by a special prosecutor; the jury decided he lied about his lobbying after leaving the White House. Lobbying after leaving Congress is not only legal but standard procedure, so no one will ever be sent to jail for lying about that.    The bill's congressional proponents and Justice Department opponents thought President Reagan had the courage to take the heat and veto. Justice even sent a proposed veto message to the White House. This noted that the prosecutors of Mr. Deaver, Ollie North, etc. have been offered parallel appointments within Justice, so wouldn't be affected by a veto. It also noted that every attorney general, both Democratic and Republican, has opposed the idea of prosecutors independent of the executive branch.    In the new version of the bill, Congress presses its campaign against the executive to new lengths. Under the current law, the attorney general decides when a counsel is warranted and who should be investigated for what. Under the new version, once a counsel is appointed he has jurisdictional carte blanche. As Justice wrote in the intended veto message, this means &quot;criminal charges can be brought without either the attorney general or the President having any role whatsoever.&quot;    The new bill creates serious due-process and civil-rights problems. Currently, the attorney general can refuse to start an investigation if there is reasonable evidence that there was no crime, including the evidence of no criminal intent. The new bill reverses this usual presumption, and requires an investigation unless there is clear and convincing evidence that a crime has not been committed. Justice noted this means executive officials &quot;are held to a higher standard of conduct than others, are subject to criminal investigation at any suggestion of misconduct and are inexorably bound into the criminal process far longer than is the case where that process is under the control of the Justice Department.&quot; This, of course, is precisely what Congress intends.    It apparently didn't occur to anyone in or around the Oval Office that Mr. Reagan's failure to veto this law damages someone considerably more important than Mike Deaver or Lyn Nofzinger. It damages the President. It damages this President, just as it damaged previous Presidents. More important yet, it will be used to diminish Mr. Reagan's successor.    Mr. Reagan's excuse was his hope that the courts would save the authority of the presidency. &quot;I am gratified that the constitutional issues presented by the statute are now squarely before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. We will continue to express our constitutional objections in that case as it moves through the courts,&quot; he said. When the courts finally decide the constitutionality of independent counsels, there should be slight doubt about the result. But that doubt is greatly increased by the message President Reagan just sent, for it is his actions that speak.    The courts naturally hesitate to protect one branch from the other when it refuses to protect itself, and the most important words on that bill are &quot;Ronald W. Reagan.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
