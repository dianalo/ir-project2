The Sacramento, Calif.-based newspaper chain said net was $7.6 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $6.6 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Per-share figures show the effect of an increase in the average number of shares outstanding to 28.5 million from 26.2 million. McClatchy's second-period revenue climbed to $90.2 million from $84.8 million. The earnings reflect the impact of higher compensation and newsprint costs.    For the six months, McClatchy had net income of $12 million, or 43 cents a share, up 21% from the year-earlier period's $10 million, or 38 cents a share. Six-month revenue rose 8% to $173 million from $160.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
