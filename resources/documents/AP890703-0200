On each point, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Scalia andJustices Byron R. White, Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connorjoined to form a majority.   There was no one opinion speaking for the five, however.Rehnquist wrote the court's main opinion, but only White and Kennedyjoined his reasoning on each point.   The court also ruled that a dispute over one Missouri provision,prohibiting the use of tax money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions not necessary to save their lives, hadbecome moot.   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joinedBlackmun's strongly worded dissent to the overall opinion.   In all, the decision yielded five opinions totaling 78 pages. Theauthors were Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, Blackmun and Stevens.   The justices also ensured that abortion will dominate the court's1989-90 term, which begins in October, by agreeing to review threeabortion disputes from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota.   In each, Roe vs. Wade is under attack.   ``I fear for the future,'' said Blackmun. ``I fear for theliberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived andcome of age in the 16 years since Roe was decided.''   He added, ``For today, the women of this nation still retain theliberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident andvery ominous, and a chill wind blows.''   Rehnquist cited high court abortion rulings since 1973 inupholding the bans on using public money, public hospitals andpublic employees for abortions.   ``The Constitution does not forbid a state or city ... fromexpressing a preference for normal childbirth,'' the chief justicewrote.   In upholding the Missouri provision requiring fetal testing,Rehnquist, White and Kennedy criticized the trimester-by-trimesterapproach of Roe vs. Wade.   ``We do not see why the state's interest in protecting potentialhuman life should come into existence only at the point ofviability, and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowingstate regulation after viability but prohibiting it beforeviability,'' Rehnquist said.   Scalia provided a fourth vote to junk the trimester approach, butO'Connor _ who has criticized that approach in previous abortionrulings _ refused to go along.   Although she voted to uphold the Missouri fetal-testingrequirement, O'Connor said, ``There will be time enough tore-examine Roe. And to do so carefully.''   As had been suspected even before Monday's ruling, O'Connorclearly will be the key vote in any future abortion ruling.   While Missouri officials were preparing their appeal to thenation's highest court, former Reagan administration lawyer WilliamBradford Reynolds suggested that the state's appeal include a callfor the overturning of Roe vs. Wade.   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election lastNov. 8, the Reagan administration supported Missouri's appeal.   The Bush administration also backed Missouri's efforts to restoreits abortion regulations.   In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numberswrote and telephoned the court to express their views. Before theApril arguments, the court was receiving tens of thousands ofletters each day, and the court's two switchboards were so floodedwith calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.   Scalia referred to the public pressure, stating, ``We can nowlook forward to at least another term with carts full of mail fromthe public, and streets full of demonstrators.''   In a more formal form of lobbying, the court also received arecord number of ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs _ unsolicited advicefrom individuals and organizations not part of the Missourilitigation.   In all, 78 such briefs were filed.</TEXT></DOC>
