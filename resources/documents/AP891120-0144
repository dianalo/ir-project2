For the first time in decades, major protests involving tens ofthousands of citizens also broke out in other cities, state-runCzechoslovak TV said.   The protests posed the greatest threat to date to the rigidmodel of Communist government that has prevailed here since aSoviet-led invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movementin 1968.   Czechoslovak TV said at least 200,000 people took part in themarch in the capital. It also reported 20,000 protesters in thecity of Brno, 10,000 in Bratislava and 5,000 in Liberec.   ``Freedom!'' and ``End to one-party rule!'' cried thedemonstrators in Prague. Their protest began with a few hundredpeople in downtown Wenceslas Square and turned into a triumphalmarch for democracy, accompanied by the clanging of bells fromsympathetic trolley-car drivers. Bystanders jangled their keys insolidarity.   From Wenceslas Square, the protesters set out for HradcanyCastle, a national symbol and the residence of President GustavHusak. They were blocked by police barriers and later dispersedpeacefully after a three-hour march.   ``It's the end, Milos!'' the demonstrators shouted, referring toCommunist Party chief Milos Jakes. To fellow Czechoslovaks, theychanted, ``Stop being afraid!''   Jakes responded by warning the demonstrators not to go too far.   ``Any attempts to disrupt social and political stability ... canonly seriously threaten the implementation of necessary change andbring the society into a crisis with unforeseeable consequences,''the 67-year-old leader said on television.   In a sharp break with usual practice, the television devotedextensive coverage to the demonstrations, and the official newsagency CTK and Czechoslovak radio reported the protesters' demandsfor free elections.   Some protesters carried banners reading ``Red murderers tocourt'' _ a reference to the alleged death of mathematics studentMartin Smid. Dissidents say Smid was killed Friday by police, butthe government called reports of the death ``an unfounded rumor.''   The demonstrators also supported a general strike called bystudents and artists for Nov. 27.   In Washington, the State Department canceled a planned visit byJan Fojtik, chief ideologist of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,because of the use of force against protesters.   Department spokeswoman said earlier the police actions were ``insharp contrast to other East European countries who are beginningto respond to the wishes of their people.''   Monday's demonstrations in Czechoslovakia were the latest signsof political unrest sweeping Eastern Europe.   More than 200,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the EastGerman city of Leipzig to press for free elections and an end tothe Communist monopoly on power. Communist Party chief Egon Krenzmet with an envoy from Bonn in talks expected to focus on financialaid.   In Romania, however, President Nicolae Ceausescu told a partycongress that he rejects reforms and proclaimed the perpetuation ofrigid Communist rule.   Czechoslovakia's government also has rejected reforms, butMonday's protest in Prague was the fourth in as many days andindicated severe trouble for the leadership.   Police did not stop the march, but they set up barriers acrossbridges on the Vltava river leading to Hradcany Castle. Manydemonstrators changed course at that point and continued to a majorplaza, Old Town Square, chanting ``We are the people.''   The small police presence contrasted sharply with the situationFriday, when security forces severely beat demonstrators. Theviolence prompted outrage at home and abroad. The State Departmentcalled on the Czechoslovak government to ``end this senselessviolence against its own citizens.''   ``By attacking peaceful demonstrators, Czechoslovakianauthorities further damaged their credibility at home and abroad,''said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   Also Monday, students began a sit-in strike at Pragueuniversities to protest the police attacks, and television reportedsome high schools had gone on strike.   Vaclav Havel, a prominent playwright and activist whose worksare banned in his homeland, canceled a trip to Sweden, where he wasdue to accept the Olof Palme award, to protest the violence. InSweden, it was announced that Foreign Minister Sten Andersson willgo to Prague to present the award to Havel.   Krenz postponed a Tuesday visit to Prague without giving areason. Britain summoned the Czechoslovak ambassador to protest thepolice beatings of two British journalists. It called the weekendviolence ``disgraceful and gratuitous.''   According to unofficial reports, student strike committees werenegotiating with university authorities at the Technical Universityin Prague and the downtown Film Faculty.   At least three official Prague theaters went on a de factostrike, refusing to put on shows and terminating cooperation withofficial media, actors said by telephone, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   A statement of the official Socialist Union of Youth calledFriday's crackdown on student demonstrators ``politicallyirresponsible.''   The communique was endorsed by Vasil Mohorita, the union'schairman and Communist Party Central Committee secretary. It wasthe first time a Communist official publicly condemned such policeaction.   The march Friday commemorated student Jan Opletal, killed by theNazis 50 years ago. It was the largest demonstration inCzechoslvakia since August 1969, when about 50,000 people gatheredin Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion crushed reform.</TEXT></DOC>
