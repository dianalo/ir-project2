Ernest Beazley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LTV </CO><IN> TNM MIN BCY </IN><TEXT>   LTV Corp., moving again to shrink its steel unit, agreed to sell one of its largest steel mills to closely held Renco Group Inc., of New York.    Terms weren't disclosed, but Dallas-based LTV said it hopes to close the sale of its Warren, Ohio, steel plant and a related operation by June 30. Officials of the United Steelworkers union estimated that the sale price was $140 million.    LTV disclosed the pact as it began briefing creditors in Dallas on its plan to emerge from federal bankruptcy-law proceedings. Some creditors have already expressed strong opposition to the plan, which contemplates reorganizing the company around its existing steel, aerospace and energy businesses. LTV filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code protection in July 1986.    Yesterday's announcement is the latest illustration of how LTV has used bankruptcy-law proceedings to trim its bloated steel operations. It also shows how major steelmakers are focusing limited capital on select plants.    Since filing for Chapter 11, LTV has shed 39% of its raw steelmaking capacity, including 1.5 million tons a year at Warren, a maker of flat-rolled steel for pipe and tube. Included in the planned sale is a separate unit that makes drainage pipe.    Sale of the mill would solidify LTV's fall into third place among the nation's steelmakers. Ranked by shipments, Bethlehem Steel Corp. recaptured the No. 2 spot during the first quarter, and many analysts and creditors expect LTV to pare another 10% of capacity before it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings. USX Corp. is the nation's No. 1 steelmaker.    While selling Warren moves LTV a step ahead in its bankruptcy-reorganization, the company faces a more-formidable hurdle in peddling its loss-plagued steel-bar operations -- a legacy of the company's ill-fated 1984 acquisition of Republic Steel Corp.    Unlike most other types of steel, which have rebounded smartly under federal quotas and a weak dollar, demand for alloy and specialty bar remains in the doldrums. Bar is used to make such products as tractors and heavy machinery.    John E. Jacobson, a steel economist, estimates that since 1981 bar prices have fallen every year except 1987, when they were flat compared with 1986. Mr. Jacobson, noting increasing domestic competition from steel minimills, forecasts no pickup in demand through at least 1990.    Under the contract, LTV said it will retain the pension liabilities for the operations' 2,300 workers. They are part of a group of pension plans with an actuarial deficit of about $2 billion. As part of its bankruptcy reorganization, LTV is fighting in court to force the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to take responsibility for the shortfall.    Sale of Warren fits LTV's strategy to focus its steel unit and its capital around modern mills in East Chicago, Ind., Cleveland and Hennepin, Ill. Each of the plants makes or finishes flat-rolled steel for the auto and appliance industries.    Renco officials declined to return telephone calls. The company operates 15 units that make products ranging from underwear fasteners to industrial sewing machines. It operates one other steel company -- Sabel Industries -- an Alabama steel distributor. </TEXT></DOC>
