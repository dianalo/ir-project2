Gorbachev was right on the mark. ``Icouldn't have asked,'' he said, ``for a better result from thisnonsummit summit.'' Nor could anyone.   Their eight hours of talks did not resolve all the issues thatseparate the United States and the Soviet Union. Nobody expectedthem to.   It was hoped, though, that the Malta talks would establish atone for future relations between the two leaders, articulate somegeneralized expectations, and set forth specific areas on whichsubstantive formal agreements might be signed at their summit inWashington next June.   All three objectives were met in full.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 1</TEXT><TEXT>   Orange County (Calif.) Register on Chinese student visas:   (President Bush's) decision to veto a bill that would guaranteevisa extensions to 60,000 Chinese students in the United States wasa betrayal of our deepest values. ...   The Chinese student leaders who pleaded publicy with PresidentBush ... to sign this bill took a risk few Americans wouldunderstand. Since the violent crackdown on the pro-democracymovement in Tienanmen Square, the Chinese government has monitorednews reports worldwide to identify dissenters. ...   Leaders of the Tienanmen Square demonstrations still in Chinaare now being punished for their presumption. The luckiest haveonly been run out of school, and face a life of slave labor. Manyhave been arrested and tortured; some have been shot.   The Chinese Immigration Act, passed overwhelmingly by Congress,would have given the Chinese students nothing but time _ no money,no special benefits, just a four-year visa extension. ...   Perhaps during that time the freedom movement in China wouldmake enough progress that it would be safe to return. ...   The president said the bill was unnecessary because he plans tooffer the same provisions through administrative rather thanlegislative means. ... The State Department and the administrationclaim they weren't influenced by the fact, but the Chinesegovernment was livid about the bill and threatened to cancelstudent-exchange programs. ...   By caving in to Beijing's whims, the administration sends amessage that the United States is so eager to restore relations oncozy, pre-massacre terms that it will hold hostage these bravestudents who represent the best hope that democracy may someday bepossible in mainland China. ...   President Bush has demonstrated that his sympathies lie morewith China's dictators than with her freedom fighters. ... Hedeserves our scorn.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 1   Philadelphia Daily News on the auto industry:   In case you've been wondering why the American automobileindustry has gone over the edge despite the best efforts of greatbusinessmen like Lee Iacocca, ... the Washington Post ...pinpointed the reason.   It's not the American autoworker, maligned over the past severalyears as overpaid, unproductive and all kinds of other slanders.Nope. American autoworkers are making cars so well there are linesforming for them all over Japan, where automobile quality is almosta cult.   The trouble is somewhere else altogether. The trouble startswith the very same people whining about unfair competition andabout those allegedly lax American workers. The trouble is theimbeciles who run American automobile companies, the guys who beggovernment bailouts and mourn the passing of the tailfin.   Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi all have plants here. Thoseplants are full of American workers making cars.   Back home in Japan, people actually want those cars. Many ofthem actually prefer those cars. So there are plans to ship atleast 163,000 cars to Japan annually in a couple of years. U.S.workers are making Japanese cars to ship to Japanese buyers.   That doesn't sound like the problem is U.S. workers.   Sounds like the problem is U.S. managers. Too bad we can'texport them to Japan.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 3   Lawrence (Kan.) Journal-World on older workers:   It's good to see that older workers are getting some of therespect they deserve from employers.   A survey released ... by the American Association of RetiredPersons shows that employers have raised their opinion of olderworkers since the last AARP survey was taken four years ago.   They were particularly impressed with the work ethic displayedby older workers, their ability to handle pressure situations andthe experience they bring to the job.   Older workers are often some of the most pleasant and usefulemployees to be found in businesses. It's good to see that firmsare appreciating the jobs they do.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 4   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on postal delivery service:   Anytime the U.S. Postal Service surveys customers or takes othersteps supposedly designed to improve service, we can't help butfear that service is about to get worse or that another rate hikeis coming.   Well, the U.S. Postal Service is at it again. And we're worried.   More than a year ago, the Postal Service started what SiouxFalls Postmaster Thomas Skolak has described in letters as a majorreview of customers' needs for postal products and services.   No rate hike is involved. But delivery service is likely tochange.   Beginning next spring, some letters that may have reached theirdestination in two days may take three days. Meanwhile, lettersthat are only supposed to take one day or two days to delivershould meet deadlines with greater regularity. ...   Consider us cynical, if you want. But we're still uneasy. Theuse of a survey smacks of a ploy to justify reduced deliverystandards.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
