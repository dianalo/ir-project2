The surface-to-air missiles were contained in more than 100 tonsof weaponry sent by Libya to Ireland for the IRA in four shiploadsin 1985 and 1986, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.'s``Panorama'' program.   The program said British army helicopters operating alongNorthern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic would be the mostlikely targets. The helicopters are the army's main mode oftransport in IRA-plagued border regions.   The Irish justice minister, Gerry Collins, said some of themissiles ``may very well be'' in Northern Ireland already. The IRA,outlawed in Britain and Ireland, is fighting to drive the Britishout of the province.   John Hermon, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,Northern Ireland's police force, said he had ``no reason to doubt''the SAM-7s are hidden somewhere in Ireland.   ``As to where they are precisely, there's an element of doubt,''he said. Asked how many there were, he replied, ``That's not aquestion I'd be prepared to answer directly, but I'm satisfied thatthey exist.''   Collins said he was puzzled over how the IRA apparently was ableto unload in one night in October 1986 an estimated 105 tons ofLibyan-supplied arms using an isolated jetty near Arklow, 40 milessouth of Dublin.   ``That is something that is causing us concern, putting it verybluntly,'' Collins said. ``At the particular time we did not haveany intelligence that this was about to happen nor indeed did weknow that it did happen.''   The October shipment contained an unknown number of SAM-7s, theprogram said, quoting unidentified British and Irish securitysources. A shipment in July 1986 included four SAM-7s, it said.   Gen. Sir James Glover, British army commander of land forces inNorthern Ireland in 1979-80, said army countermeasures againstSAM-7s have been prepared but have not yet had to be tested.   Three shipments that reached Ireland were loaded off theMediterranean island of Malta and one 15 miles off Libya, theprogram said.   Last Oct. 30, authorities seized a ship, the Eksund, and itsfive Irish crewmen in French waters. The ship was carrying about150 tons of weapons, including 20 SAM-7 missiles, apparentlydestined for the IRA, the program said. The first of the fourshipments to reach Ireland was delivered in August 1985 andcontained seven tons of arms, including pistols and 70 Soviet-madeAK-47 assault rifles, the program said.   A shipment in October 1985 contained 10 tons of arms, including100 AK-47s and 10 machine guns, and a third in July 1986 contained14 tons and included four SAM-7s.   The three shiploads were landed using inflatable dinghies atClogga Strand, an isolated beach near Arklow.   In August 1986, apparently in response to the U.S. bombing raidon Libya the previous April, Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafibought a ship that in October that year was used to deliver anestimated 105 tons of weaponry to the IRA, the program said.   The arms apparently were trucked inland and hidden in alreadyprepared bunkers. Police have uncovered some of the weaponsrecently in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, but noSAM-7s have been found.   On Monday, a huge explosion in the South Armagh border area inNorthern Ireland killed two IRA guerrillas in ``an unfortunateaccident,'' the IRA said.   Police believe the IRA men were installing explosives in astolen van about two miles outside Crossmaglen village, intendingto attack an army observation post, when the explosivesaccidentally detonated.</TEXT></DOC>
