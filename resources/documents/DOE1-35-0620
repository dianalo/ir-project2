The BCS theory, which is based on phonon andelectron pair motion, has been accepted as a basic theory for metallicsuperconductors. However, the superconductive oxides recently developedhave critical temperatures as high as 30K and the above theory cannotexplain these high critical temperatures. Exciton-based superconductiontheories may be applicable to a group of low-dimensional materials suchas chain-molecular and layered organic superconductors. In addition,superconductivity theories for heavy Fermi particle materials, such asUBe{sub 13}, have been proposed which are based on inter-electron Coulombforce irrespective of the effect of phonons or excitons. It is suggestedthat high critical temperature superconductors of a low electron concentrationhave a layered structure with strong inter-electron Coulomb repulsion.(6 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
