Executive Summary</ITAG>The Commission historically has looked to the standard setting bodies designatedby the accounting profession to establish and improve accounting principles,subject to Commission oversight. \25\<NOTE/> The Commission's rules require compliance with generallyaccepted accounting principles (GAAP), and the requirements of individualrules and forms generally are used to interpret, supplement or expand uponthe basic GAAP requirements. Since December 1986 the Financial AccountingStandards Board (FASB) has issued several Statements of Financial AccountingStandards (SFAS) that result in reporting requirements that are duplicativeof, or, in some instances, different from the Commission's requirements.Additionally, oil and gas industry disclosures which had been retainedduring the phase-in period for SFAS No. 69, <T3>Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities</T3>, are no longernecessary. The purpose of these proposals is to eliminate duplicative andobsolete disclosures and to conform reporting requirements as necessaryto achieve consistency between the Commission's rules, forms and policiesand existing accounting principles.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ See, Accounting Series Release No. 150 (December 20,1973) (39 FR 1260).The following chart summarizes the proposed amendments and provides therationale for such changes.<ITAG tagnum="74">Summary of Proposed Amendments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The table that follows is presented as a guide to assist the readerin understanding the changes being proposed by presenting a brief descriptionof the proposed changes together with an explanation of the rationale foreach change.

Statement of Cash Flows </ITAG>In November 1987 the FASB issued SFAS No. 95, <T3>Statement of Cash Flows. </T3>Statement No. 95 requires presentationof a statement of cash flows as a component of a set of basic financialstatements and supersedes the previous requirement to present a statementof changes in financial position. The proposed amendments consist largely of ``housekeeping'' matters occasionedby the issuance of SFAS No. 95. All rules and forms that contains referencesto the previously required statement of changes in financial position wouldbe amended to refer to the newly adopted statement of cash flows.Interim Reporting The Commission proposes to amend Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X to permitthe use of an abbreviated form of the statement of cash flows for interimfinancial statements. This is consistent with the current rule, which permitsthe use of an abbreviated form of the statement of changes in financialposition. It is proposed that cash interest and income taxes paid shouldbe separately disclosed in the abbreviated statement or in a footnote thereto,since such information is believed to be valuable for financial statementanalyses. Commentators are requested to address the costs and benefitsof such disclosure in interim financial statements.Investment Companies The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X, relatingto registered investment companies, to require a cash flow statement tobe presented to the extent necessary to comply with GAAP.\26\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 102,<T3>Statement of Cash Flows_Exemption of Certain Enterprises and Classificationof Cash Flows from Certain Securities Acquired for Resale </T3>exemptscertain highly liquid investiment companies from the requirement to providea statement of cash flows. Foreign Private IssuersThe Commission proposes to amend Regulation S-X, Rule 3-19 and Items 17and 18 of Form 20-F to delete the existing requirement for foreign privateissuers to provide a statement of changes in financial position and toadopt a requirement to provide a statement of cash flows or substantiallysimilar information as a component of the financial statements includedin filings with the Commission. The general financial statement requirements applicable to foreign privateissuers are found in Items 17 and 18 of Form 20-F.\27\<NOTE/> These items provide that, while foreign issuers' financialstatements may be prepared according to a comprehensive body of accountingprinciples other than those generally accepted in the United States, suchfinancial statements must disclose an information content substantiallysimilar to financial statements that comply with United States GAAP. Consistentwith that requirement, it is proposed to amend Rule 3-19 to refer to astatement of cash flows and to expand the language of Items 17 and 18 torequire foreign issuers to present a cash flow statement or substantiallysimilar information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Form 20-F is both the registration form and the annualreport form which may be filed by foreign private issuers pursuant to therequirements of the Exchange Act. The proposal requires that financial statement that are prepared in accordancewith a comprehensive body of principles that does not require a statementof cash or funds flow must include a statement of cash flows that complieswith the requirements of SFAS No. 95. If the financial statements are preparedin accordance with a body of principles that requires a cash or funds flowstatement in a format that differs from the statement required in the UnitedStates, the proposal permits presentation of substantially similar informationin financial statement or footnote form.\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ The substantially similar information may be presentedin a tabular reconciliation format provided that such reconciliation canbe presented in a clearly understandable manner. Compliance with the requirement to present an information content substantiallysimilar to financial statements that comply with U.S. GAAP would requirepresentation of all supplemental disclosures required by SFAS No. 95. Forexample, paragraph 32 of SFAS No. 95 requires disclosure of noncash financingand investing activities. Paragraph 29 requires companies that do not adopt the direct method ofreporting operating cash flows to disclose the amounts of interest andincome taxes paid during the period. The purpose of this latter disclosureis to provide comparability with the direct method of presentation of thestatement of cash flows, which requires separate presentation of interestand income taxes paid, and because the FASB believed that information aboutinterest and taxes was both available and useful. Analysts have specificallyrequested this information, indicating its usefulness in assessing an enterprise'sdebt service requirements relative to its operating cash flows. Commentsare specifically requested as to the costs and benefits of requiring anyor all of this supplemental disclosure and with respect to the format ofthe information presented.In proposing to amend the reporting requirements for foreign private issuers,the Commission does not believe it would impose an undue hardship on foreignregistrants.\29\<NOTE/> Foreign registrants are required by the Commission's currentrules to provide a statement of changes in financial position and in mostcases it would be a relatively minor adjustment to convert from a statementof changes in financial position to a statement of cash flows.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ In attempting to assess the burden on foreign registrants,the Commission has considered International Accounting Standards (IAS)that have been adopted and published by the International Accounting StandardsCommittee (IASC). The IASC is an international professional organizationwhich is supported by professional accounting bodies representing approximately70 countries. A major role of the IASC is to promote worldwide harmonizationof accounting standards.<ITAG tagnum="28">IAS No. 7 requires inclusion in basic financial statements of a statementof changes in financial position for each year for which an income statementis provided. As was the case in the United States prior to the adoptionof SFAS No. 95, the statement is permitted to be prepared on either a cashor working capital basis and must disclose ``funds'' provided by operations.IASC's 1988 </ITAG><T3>Annual Review </T3>reported the results of a survey that indicatedthat in excess of 90% of surveyed countries had adopted standards thatwere in conformity with IAS No. 7. The IASC's <T3>Survey of the Use and Application of International Accounting Standards1988 </T3>notes that there is interest in may parts of the world in usingcash flow statements and there is a growing trend in favor of the use ofcash rather than working capital in presentation of the changes in financialcondition. The Commission recognizes that strict compliance may be more difficultor costly for some foreign private issuers.\30\<NOTE/> However, the Commission believes that the disclosures prescribedby SFAS No. 95 are useful, and that it should continue to require foreignissuers to file basic financial statements containing information thatis substantially similar to that required by U.S. GAAP.\31\<NOTE/> Commentators are encouraged to address whether foreign privateissuers would face any unusual problems in developing and presenting acash flow statement or substantially similar information.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Implementation of SFAS No. 95 reportedly has been moredifficult for some U.S. registrants than for others. For example, financialinstitutions may have had to develop new systems for gathering data necessaryfor preparation of the new cash flow statement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ The Commission notes that, as with any other accountingissue, foreign registrants may consult with the staff with regard to anyunusual difficulty or burden imposed by the Commission's rules.SummarizedFinancial Information Although not specifically included in the proposed amendments, the Commissionencourages specific public comments on whether Rule 1-02(aa) should beexpanded to include disclosure of cash flows from operating, investingand financing activities as well as total cash flow information. Rule 1-02(aa)sets forth minimum requirements for the content of summarized financialinformation of subsidiaries and investees accounted for under the equitymethod and presently does not include cash flow data. Commentators arerequested to address the usefulness of such a requirement and the natureand extent of the data that should be required.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Reporting on Income Taxes </ITAG>In December 1987 the FASB issued SFAS No. 96, <T3>Accounting for Income Taxes.</T3> Statement No. 96 establishes financialaccounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes on reportingentities.\32\<NOTE/> It requires an asset and liability approach to accountingand reporting for income taxes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ SFAS No. 96 as amended by SFAS No. 100 is effective foryears beginning after December 15, 1989. Earlier application is permitted.Initial application must be as of the beginning of an enterprise's fiscalyear. Financial statements for fiscal years before the effective date ofthe statement may be restated to conform to the provisions of the statement.Rule 4-08(h) of Regulation S-X contains the Commission's income tax disclosurerequirements. Certain of those requirements were adopted by the FASB inStatement 96. The Commission proposes to amend Rule 4-08(h) to delete requirementsthat are now included in SFAS No. 96. Specifically, the requirement inRule 4-08(h) to provide a reconciliation between the amount of reportedtotal income tax expense and the amount computed by multiplying the income(loss) before tax by the applicable statutory Federal income tax rate isnow unnecessary because paragraph 28 of SFAS No. 96 requires a similarreconciliation. Additionally, it is proposed that the disclosure of the amounts of deferredtaxes be revised in order to make such disclosure consistent with the balancesheet orientation of the new deferred tax standard. Presently, Rule 4-08(h)calls for disclosure of the net effect on income tax expense of significanttiming differences (such as depreciation or warranty costs). Since SFASNo. 96 focuses on the balances sheet rather than income statement impactof significant temporary differences, the Commission is proposing to reviseits rules for income tax disclosures by substituting a requirement to disclosethe amount of each significant component of a deferred tax liability orasset. The Commission believes that such information is useful to users of financialstatements in assessing the potential timing and the degree of managementcontrol over the reversal of timing differences.\33\<NOTE/> Further, the Commission believes that such information wouldbe readily available to the registrant since it is a necessary componentof the calculations required by SFAS No. 96. Commentators are requestedto address the costs and benefits of providing this information. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ For example, while the reversal of timing differenceswhich result from the use of accelerated tax depreciation methods may besignificantly influenced by managerial decisions, the reversal of an accruedlitigation reserve generally would be contingent upon external events.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Loan Origination Fees </ITAG>In December 1986 the FASB issued SFAS No. 91, <T3>Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originatingor Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases.</T3> Rule 9-03 ofRegulation S-X, which governs the form and content of balance sheets ofbank holding companies, currently requires presentation of the total loanportfolio balance with separate disclosure of related loan loss allowancesand unearned income. The Commission proposes to amend Rule 9-03.7 to requiredisclosure of the net unamortized deferred origination fees and costs whichSFAS No. 91 requires to be carried as part of the loan balance. Separatedisclosure is consistent with requirements for disclosures of other accountsthat are related to loan balances. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Companies </ITAG>In December 1987 the FASB issued SFAS No. 97, <T3>Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain LongDuration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.</T3>SFAS No. 97 requires that realized investment gains and losses be includedin the determination of income from operations, rather than being presentedin the income statement below operating earnings shown net of applicableincome taxes. Consistent with this standard, the Commission proposes toamend Rule 7-04 of Regulation S-X to require the presentation of realizedgains and losses on a pretax basis in the computation of income or lossfrom continuing operations. The Commission understands that there is somediversity in practice among insurance companies with respect to whetherrealized gains and losses allocable to policyholders and separate accounts\34\<NOTE/> are included in realized gains and losses reported in financialstatements. Required disclosure of the amounts of realized gains and lossesallocable to policyholders and separate accounts is proposed to facilitatecomparability of financial statements by enabling users of financial statementsto identify gains and losses which inure to the benefit of shareholdersas opposed to policyholders and separate accounts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ A separate account is defined in section 2(a)(37) ofthe Investment Company Act of 1940 and in paragraphs 53 and 54 of SFASNo. 60. A separate account of an insurance company is an account in whichthe gains and losses on assets allocated to the account are credited toor charged against the account rather than the insurance company's generaloperations. SFAS No. 97 also addresses accounting for other consideration earned byinsurance enterprises such as administrative and surrender charges. Inorder to accommodate recognition of the broader range of revenue generatingactivities of insurance enterprises, Rule 7-04 is proposed to be amendedto include a new revenue caption, ``Other consideration.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Consolidation of Majority Owned Subsidiaries </ITAG>In October 1987, the FASB issued SFAS No. 94, <T3>Consolidation of All Majority Owned Subsidiaries,</T3> which requiresconsolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries unless control is temporaryor does not rest with the majority owner. The Financial Reporting Codificationis amended at Section 105 to delete the discussion of the non-homogeneityexception to consolidation which was eliminated by the adoption of thenew standard. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Oil and Gas Disclosure Requirements </ITAG>The Commission is also proposing to delete Rule 4-10(k) of S-X that requiressupplemental disclosures of oil and gas producing activities that are substantiallysimilar to disclosure requirements contained in SFAS No. 69. This ruleis no longer necessary because the transition period for the applicationof comparable rules under SFAS No. 69 has expired.\35\<NOTE/> As a result of the deletion of paragraph (6) of Rule 4-10(k),an amendment is also being proposed to Rule 4-10(i)(4), which currentlyrefers to Rule 4-10(k)(6), to direct registrants to the requirements ofSFAS No. 69 in applying the full cost ceiling test. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ When SFAS No. 69 was adopted in 1982, it was made effectivefor years beginning on or after December 15, 1982 with earlier applicationencouraged but not required. The Commission's rules were amended in 1983to indicate that the requirements of Rule 4-10(k) would not apply to fiscalyears beginning on or after December 15, 1982, thus ensuring that supplementaldisclosure requirements under Rule 4-10(k) would phase out as SFAS No.69 requirements phased in. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Solicitation of Comments </ITAG>As noted above, the Commission is proposing amendments to its rules andforms to conform them to current GAAP and to eliminate duplication of GAAPrequirements. The Commission is soliciting comments to determine whetherthese changes adequately address the new accounting standards and to determinewhether other amendments of these items are appropriate for that purpose.The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed revisions,if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competition or would imposea burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furtheringthe purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchangte Act. Comments in thisregard will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilitiesunder section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>David S. Ruder, Chairman of the Commission, has certified that the proposedamendments will not have a significant economic impact on any entity subjectto their provisions, and, therefore, will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. The reason for this certificationis that the proposed amendments are intended to conform rules and formsto GAAP, as recently amended, to which registrants are already subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">Codification Update </ITAG>The ``Codification of Financial Reporting Policies'' announced in FinancialReporting Release 1 (Apil 15, 1982) (47 FR 21028) is updated: 1. By amending section 102.03 to replace the references to ``changes infinancial position'' with ``cash flows''. 2. By amending section 105 to delete paragraph (b) and to redesignate paragraphs(c) and (d) as (b) and (c). 3. By amending the first paragraph in section 202.03 to replace the referenceto ``cash or funds generated'' with ``cash flows''. 4.
