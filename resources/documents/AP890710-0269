Analysts said talk of a recent gradual turn by the Fed toward apolicy of easier credit has been reinforced by a decline in theinterest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks.   Rates on long-term government bonds, which crested well above 9percent earlier this year, have lately dropped to the threshold of 8percent.   New York's Chase Manhattan Bank and a few smaller banks todaylowered their prime lending rates from 11 percent to 10.5 percent.   Wall Street's optimists argue that the decline in the cost ofborrowed money will help cushion the business impact of slowingeconomic growth, which has been evident for the past several months.   Worries persist in the financial world, however, about theprospective effects of a throttled-down economy on corporate profits.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
