Yet he survives. Such is the political life of Helmut Kohl.    But the question now is can he prevail in next year's national elections. The answer is maybe. But in the aftermath of his latest political dispute, one thing is clear: it would be a mistake to write off the West Germany chancellor.    Mr. Kohl once again proved this week that while he may lack panache, he understands power politics and, above all, has a keen instinct for enduring. For months the chancellor's detractors have been predicting his imminent demise. And much of the rumor-mongering emanated from his own party headquarters. So last week, Mr. Kohl, tanned and back from a three-week holiday by an Austrian lake, sacked the chief source of those rumors, party manager Heiner Geissler.    It was an unceremonious end and Mr. Geissler probably deserved better. But Mr. Kohl reckoned rightly that the furor would ultimately die down and that he might help himself in the process. Last Monday, party leaders convened for a nine-hour meeting amid suggestions that a rival candidate might challenge the chancellor's position as chairman of the Christian Democratic Union. Mr. Kohl received a lot of criticism in that meeting. But, in the end, no rival candidate emerged.    &quot;The chancellor in effect said, 'Put up or shut up,'&quot; says Wolfgang Gibowski, an independent pollster at the Election Research Group in Mannheim. The flap over Mr. Geissler's dismissal, Mr. Gibowski adds, has &quot;strengthened the chancellor. He demonstrated that he is in control.&quot;    Of course, Mr. Kohl isn't out of danger yet. He faces a crucial test at the Christian Democratic Union convention that opens in Bremen Sept. 10. Although it now seems virtually certain that Mr. Kohl will run unopposed for re-election as party chairman, delegates could seek to embarrass him by rejecting his hand-picked successor to Mr. Geissler, foreign affairs specialist Volker Ruehe. They also could reject the chancellor himself.    If they don't, however, Mr. Kohl will emerge from the party convention in significantly better shape for next year's campaign. One reason is the ejection of Mr. Geissler. Mr. Kohl's aides say that the chief reason he got the boot was because the chancellor didn't trust him anymore. But questions about Mr. Geissler's loyalty ignore another good reason for his removal: Mr. Geissler was the party's chief strategist, and his strategies weren't working.    Mr. Geissler's chief pursuit was trying to scoop up voters with his ideological viewpoint, namely those on the moderate left. But that isn't where the next election is expected to be won or lost. The right wing is the problem, and Mr. Geissler seemed both unwilling and unable to counter the stunning rise of the far-right Republicans, who have recently scored heavily at the polls.    By removing Mr. Geissler and replacing him with Mr. Ruehe, the chancellor took a calculated risk: he was willing to alienate the moderate left of the party in the hope that the conservative right may be placated.    That strategy may have promise. Mr. Ruehe is said to have excellent relations with Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union's Bavarian sister party, who disliked Mr. Geissler. The conservatives also seem quite satisfied with the policy changes that have come about since Mr. Kohl's electoral troubles first surfaced last spring {indeed, there have been unsubstantiated suggestions that Mr. Waigel conditioned his acceptance of the finance ministry portfolio last April on Mr. Geissler's dismissal}.    Whether better relations between Mr. Kohl and mainstream conservatives will ultimately translate into more votes for the Christian Democratic Union is the critical question. For Mr. Kohl's party to be returned to power in December 1990, the party must defeat the Republicans and keep them out of parliament. Aides to Mr. Kohl say he wants to conduct the main part of the election campaign from the chancellor's office rather than from party headquarters. Either way, the confrontation with the far-right is certain to fully test Mr. Kohl's instincts for survival. </TEXT></DOC>
