Earlier in the day, Turkey appealed to the conference to helpethnic Turks who have been subject to an assimilation campaign inBulgaria.   Romania and Bulgaria are expected to be singled out as nationsthat routinely violate human rights by the month-long 35-nationConference on the Human Dimension, which began Tuesday in Paris. Itis being held in the framework of the East-West Helsinki Accords onhuman rights.   U.S. chief delegate Morris B. Abram told delegates that morethan 20,000 people had fled Romania in the past 18 months to escapepolitical and economic repression. He said Romania now ``turns itsback'' on the human rights commitments it made with other nations.   Romania has come under heavy criticism from nations includingHungary, its Communist bloc neighbor, for a program to destroythousands of villages populated by ethnic Hungarians and resettletheir populations in industrial centers.   However, Constantin Ene, chief of Romania's delegation, said thedelegates should ignore their mandate to examine specific cases ofhuman rights abuse.   He said such a process would interfere with a nation'ssovereignty. ``I want to underline that the domestic and foreignpolicies of Romania are decided in Bucharest and not in just anycapital,'' he said.   Challenging Ene, Abram told reporters at a news conference:``Sovereignty does not give a state a right to oppress its owncitizens.''   An emigre source said a leading Romanian dissident, DoinaCornea, was beaten and kicked by Romanian police for the secondtime this month when she tried to leave home May 18.   Mihnea Berindei, a spokesman for the Paris-based Romanian Leagueof Human Rights, told The Associated Press in Vienna, Austria, thatit was not known if Cornea was allowed to receive medical treatmentin a hospital.   Emigre sources said the dissident was also beaten earlier thismonth and told she would not receive a visa to attend the humanrights conference in Paris.   Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz said ethnic Turks faceirradication as a national minority in Bulgaria. He calledBulgaria's assimilation campaign ``one of the gravest human rightsviolations of our time.''   Bulgaria started the drive in 1984, forcing ethnic Turks tochange their Moslem names to Slavic ones and forbidding use of theTurkish language and Islamic worship.   Bulgaria has said three people were killed over the weekend inrioting by ethnic Turks. Turkish emigres sources say up to 30people died.   Some ethnic Turks at the Paris conference say Bulgaria isimprisoning, torturing, exiling or killing those who resistassimilation.   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, saysabout 100 Turks died fighting the campaign and thousands werejailed.   Bulgarian President Todor Zhivkov has blamed the charges on a``campaign of slander'' by Turkey and Western groups.   Also Wednesday, Bulgarian exile sources said a union leader whoplanned to attend the Paris conference was arrested May 26.   The sources in Austria and West Germany said KonstantinTrenchev, chairman of an independent Trade Union of IntellectualWorkers, faces charges that could jail him for up to 15 years.   They said he had helped ethnic Turks draft a resolutionpublicizing their grievances.</TEXT></DOC>
