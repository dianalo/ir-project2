<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-1167 </DOCNO><TEXT>We describe unique, high-affinity binding sites for omega[{sup 125}I]conotoxinGVIA in membranes from rat brain and rabbit sympathetic ganglia whichappear to be primarily associated with N-type voltage-dependent calciumchannels. The dissociation constant (KD) for the toxin in rat brain membranesis 60 pM. Physiologic extracellular concentrations of calcium inhibittoxin binding noncompetitively (IC50 = 0.2 mM). The regional distributionof the binding sites in rat brain differs markedly from that of dihydropyridinecalcium antagonist receptors associated with L-type calcium channels.In detergent-solubilized brain membranes, toxin binding retains the sameaffinity, specificity, and ionic sensitivity as in particulate preparations.</TEXT></DOC>
