In 40% of these patients evenby computed tomography metastasis was only suspected, in 8% there wereunspecific findings, while by follow-up bone metastasis was proven. In64.8% of the whole patient collective there were metastatic destructionsand in 32.6% of patients benign lesions were found. Superiority of CTcompared to conventional X-ray diagnosis resulted from exact demonstrationof the intra- and extraosseous extent of lesions and the possibilityof density measurements. It depended mainly upon the localisation ofthe pathologic process.</TEXT></DOC>
