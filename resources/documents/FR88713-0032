Box 231,Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petitionsto EPA on behalf of Dr. Robert H. Kupelian, National Director, IR-4 Project,and the named Agricultural Experiment Stations. These petitions requestedthat the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act, propose the establishment of tolerances for residuesof the insecticide methomyl  (<T3>S</T3>-methyl-<T3>N</T3>-[(methylcarbamoyl)oxy]thioacetimidate) in or on certain rawagricultural commodities as follows:1. PP 4E3143 on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Stations of Californiaand Florida in or on the commodities in the <T3>Brassica </T3>(cole) leafy vegetables crop group at 6 parts per million(ppm).2. PP 4E3144 on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Floridain or on leeks at 3 ppm.The data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for whichthe tolerances are sought. The toxicological data considered in supportof the proposed tolerances include:1. A 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in rats, which is negativefor oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study, with a no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) for systemic effects of 100 ppm (equivalent to 5.0 milligrams(mg)/kilogram (kg)/day).2. A 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in mice, which is negativefor oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study, with a NOEL forsystemic effects at 50 ppm (equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg/day).3. A 2-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 100 ppm (equivalent to 2.5mg/kg/day).4. A rat teratology study with no teratogenic effects observed at 400 ppm(the highest dose tested), and a maternal NOEL of 100 ppm.5. A rabbit teratology study with no teratogenic or fetotoxic effects at16 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested) and a NOEL for maternal toxicity at2 mg/kg/day.6. A three-generation reproduction study in rats with no reproductive effectsobserved at 100 ppm (highest dose tested).7. Mutagenicity testing including an Ames test (negative), a rat cytogeneticstudy (negative), and an <T3>in-vitro </T3>transformation assay (negative).The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on the 2-year feeding study indogs (NOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day) and using a 100-fold safety factor, is calculatedto be 0.025 mg/kg or body weight (bw)/day. The maximum permitted intake(MPI) for a 60-kg human is calculated to be 1.5 mg/day. The theoreticalmaximum residue contribution (TMRC) from existing tolerances for a 1.5-kgdaily diet is calculated to be 0.016766 mg/kg/day; the current action willincrease the TMRC by 0.0003361 mg/kg/day (a 2-percent increase).The metabolism of methomyl in animals has not been fully characterized.Thiodicarb, a structurally similar pesticide, has been shown to form aminor animal metabolite, acetamide, which has been demonstrated to inducecancer in rats. A metabolism study in animals is currently underway, andthe results will be addressed in the final registration standard for methomyl,which is scheduled for completion in 1988.The nature of the residues in plants is adequately understood, and availablemetabolism data demonstrate that acetamide is not likely to occur in plantsfollowing treatment with methomyl. Since the proposed tolerances are forcommodities that are not recognized as livestock feed items, there is noreason to believe that the tolerances will result in methomyl residuesin meat, milk, poultry, or eggs.An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, using a sulfur-sensitivephotometric detector, is available for enforcement purposes in the Foodand Drug Adminstration Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol, II (PAM II).Based on the above information considered by the Agency, the tolerancesestablished by amending 40 CFR 180.253 would protect the public health.Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forthbelow.Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registrationof a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein,may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>that this rulemaking proposal be referred toan Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber, (PP 4E3143, 4E3144/P455). All written comments filed in responseto this document will be available in the Information Services Section,at the address given above from 8 a.m to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,except legal holidays.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edwin F.
