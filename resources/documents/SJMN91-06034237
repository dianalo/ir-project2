Scud attacks hadeased, allied warplanes flew virtually unopposed and a massive oil leak hadbeen plugged. But then came Tuesday's &quot;hellacious&quot; battle, with thousands ofIraqi troops attacking allied positions in Saudi Arabia and taking over aSaudi coastal town. Eleven Marines and perhaps dozens of Iraqis were killed inthe first hours, but the fighting will probably be insignificant in the war'sfinal outcome -- other than to forecast how bloody the land war is likely tobe.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  A WEEK AT WARA ROUNDUP OF THE NEWS IN THE PERSIAN GULFLAST WEEK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WAR IN THE GULFSee also related stories on pages 1A and 16A-22A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>  SUNDAY; Jan. 27; Americans hear more chilling predictions from Iraqi leaderSaddam Hussein: Chemical weapons will be used against U.S. ground forces,special suicide bombing runs will be made against Saudi oil fields usingdevastating fuel-air explosives, and long-range bombers will attack Israel.;MONDAY; Jan. 28; &quot;Jesus God, have pity on their souls,&quot; mutters Marine Cpl.Lee Welverton as American howitzers are fired on Iraqi troops in southernKuwait. &quot;You want to damage the enemy; you want to kill him and destroy hismight.
