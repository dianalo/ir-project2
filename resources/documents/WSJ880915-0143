It's a problem she will grow out of. But until then, she will have to limit the time she spends at the condominium that she and her husband own in a New Jersey retirement community.    The Romers, in a settlement yesterday, agreed that Mrs. Romer can't spend more than 60 nights a year at the condominium without violating a zoning ordinance of the township of Monroe, N.J. The settlement ended the year-long legal battle over the Romers' ownership of a unit in the retirement community of Rossmoor.    The whole fuss turns on the fact that Mrs. Romer, at age 46, is underage under terms of the zoning ordinance, which set aside districts for planned retirement communities, establishing the minimum age for residents at 48. (Mr. Romer is over 48 years old). The Romers' condominium association counts residents as people who live there more than 60 days a year.    The Romers bought their unit a year ago without getting the association's approval. The association obtained an injunction last January from Superior Court Judge John E. Bachman of New Brunswick, N.J., who barred Mrs. Romer from even visiting her condominium. &quot;They couldn't have Mrs. Romer move into the community, being underage,&quot; said Leonard J. Coates, the attorney for the condominium association.    &quot;They were picking on her,&quot; said the Romers' attorney, Samuel H. Davis. But Mr. Davis concedes that age restrictions are the prerogative of condominium associations, although there may be grounds to question the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance that discriminates on the basis of age.    Mr. Davis had included a claim of unconstitutionality in a countersuit, but dropped it when the case was settled. &quot;We weren't really fighting them on that,&quot; he said.    The Romers, who live in New York City and wanted the condominium only as a base for weekend golf, couldn't be reached for comment. But the lawyers say the settlement should satisfy the Romers' neighbors for the next two years.    Until then, when Mrs. Romer turns 48 and can join her husband as a member of the condominium association, &quot;she's being treated as any other visitor would be treated,&quot; Mr. Coates said. </TEXT></DOC>
