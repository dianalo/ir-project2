This new part consolidates, revises, and clarifies the policies,requirements, and procedures presently contained in various REA publications,including REA Bulletin 320-4, ``Preloan Procedures for Telephone Loan Applicants,''pertaining to the methodology to be used by REA in reviewing and approvingloans and releases of loan funds.The above Bulletin also contains certain other policies, requirements,and procedures that will be incorporated into other CFR parts. This Bulletinwill then be rescinded. Part 1751 sets forth the provisions and requirements of the RE Act andthe REA administrative policies, requirements, and procedures concerningloan budgets, feasibility studies, characteristics letters, loan recommendations,and releases of funds. The primary objectives of the proposed rule areto update, consolidate, clarify, and simplify REA policies and procedures;to lessen the paperwork burden on borrowers; and to decrease processingtime by REA.All borrowers applying for or receiving loans or releases of loan fundswill be affected by this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Public comments concerning this proposed rule must be receivedby REA no later than November 17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments may be mailed to F.

The Draft RegulatoryImpact Analysis describing the options considered in developing this ruleis available on request from the above named individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule is issued in conformity withExecutive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1) havean annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Therefore, this rule has been determined to be ``not major.''This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 et seq. (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedNotice to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985),this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507),the reporting and recordkeeping provisions that are included in these proposedrules have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management andBudget (OMB). They will not be effective until approved by OMB.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 16 hours per response including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Officer, ORIM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Managementand Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for REA, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background:</ITAG>Currently, the policies and requirements concerning loan budgets, feasibilitystudies, characteristics letters, loan recommendations, and releases offunds are contained in numerous REA publications. Many of these are outdatedand contain conflicting information. It is necessary to consolidate theinformation and make it available to the public by publishing it in the<T4>Federal Register.</T4>This proposed rule eliminates some reporting requirements and streamlinesothers, reducing the borrowers' burden, while permitting REA to maintainthe security of the Government's loans. Specifically, the limitations on the amounts REA will lend for office equipment(other than furniture), operating funds, and contingencies have been changed.7 CFR Part 1751 supersedes any sections of REA Bulletins with which itis in conflict.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1751</ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding the followingnew Part 1751:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1751_LOAN PROCESSING PROCEDURES_TELEPHONE PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.1 General statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.3 Availability of forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Review of Application</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.10 Review of Completed Loan Application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.11 Approval of Loan Design.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Estimate of Total Project Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.20 Telephone Loan Budget.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.21 Cost Allocation for Rural and Nonrural Areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Feasibility Study</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.30 Description of Feasibility Study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Characteristics Letter</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.40 Description of Characteristics Letter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Loan Approval</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.50 Loan Approval Requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.51 Approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.52 Loan Documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Release of Funds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.60 Prerequisites to the Advance of Funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1751.61 Amounts Spent for Preloan Activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq., 7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1751.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General statement.</ITAG>(a) This part sets forth the policies, procedures, and requirements ofREA during the period from its receipt of a completed loan applicationuntil the advance of funds. This part concerns the factors REA considersin determining the characteristics of a loan, such as the amount of theloan, repayment period, interest rate, and conditions to the advance offunds. Involved in this determination are: a loan budget, feasibility study,characteristics letter, loan recommendation, and release of funds. ThisCFR part supersedes all REA Bulletins that are in conflict with it.

The population figure is obtainedfrom the most recent data available from the Bureau of the Census and RandMcNally and Company. The determination of whether an area is rural is basedon the population within the corporate limits or boundaries or unincorporatedareas in existence at the time the facilities to serve the community werefirst financed by REA. If a community is considered rural at that time,it will always be considered rural.(k) ``Special Project'' means facilities involving investment in excessof $100,000 for any single subscriber.(l) ``Telephone service'' means any communication service for the transmissionof voice, sounds, signals, pictures, writing, or signs of all kinds throughthe use of electricity between the transmitting and receiving apparatus,includes all telephone lines, facilities, or systems used to render suchservice.

REA shall review the LD to determine that thesystem design in acceptable to REA, that the design is technically correct,that the cost estimates are reasonable, and that the design provides forarea coverage service. REA shall also review the population and incorporationstatus of all communities served or to be served by the borrower to determineif any nonrural areas are served and if municipal franchises are required.Any REA lending for nonrural areas must be in accordance with 7 CFR Part1745.(c) REA will notify the borrower if REA recommends major changes in subscriberprojections, design, cost estimates, or other significant matters. REAwill not continue loan processing until REA and the borrower agree on allmajor changes.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1751.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approval of loan design.</ITAG>REA shall notify the borrower when the preloan data concerning the systemdesign and costs and subscriber projections have been approved.

The budget shall show, as applicable, amounts for central offices,outside plant and station equipment, right-of-way procurement, land, buildings,removal costs, special projects, engineering, vehicles and work equipment,office equipment, operating funds, refinancing with loan funds, debt retirementwith nonloan funds, acquisitions, and contingencies. The amounts budgeted,exclusive of prior loan reserves, generally shall be rounded to the nearest$1,000.(1) If the loan is to be made concurrently with the Rural Telephone Bank(RTB), the budget shall include the amount required for the purchase ofRTB Class B stock. This is 5 percent of the amount to be borrowed fromRTB for all purposes other than the purchase of RTB Class B stock. Theborrower may elect to use nonloan funds for all or part of this requirement.(2) The amount of funds included in any loan shall be limited for certainitems.(i) Operating funds for working capital or current operating deficienciesshall be included only in cases of financial hardship as determined bythe Administrator.(ii) Contingencies shall not exceed 3 percent of the total amount of loanfunds to be used for construction, engineering, operating equipment, RTBClass B stock, and operating funds.(b) REA shall prepare the cost estimates based on the data in REA Form494, ``Loan Design Summary,'' and REA Form 495, ``Construction Cost Estimates,''and other parts of the LD submitted by the borrower, and on other pertinentinformation. See 7 CFR Part 1749. The amounts included in the proposedbudget shall be the estimated costs, less the value of materials and supplieson hand or acquired that can be used in the proposed construction. Thecost estimates in the LD may be adjusted by REA in consultation with theborrower and, as appropriate, its engineer. See andSection; 1751.10(c).(c) Generally, the new loan shall be reduced by any required equity fundsand funds available in reserves to determine the proposed loan requirement.(d) Where amounts are available in reserves, REA may, at its option, denyfurther advances of these funds if they will be used to finance projectsin the proposed loan.(e) The budget shall also show, if applicable, the reserves for each budgetpurpose as of the date of the latest REA Form 481, ``Financial RequirementStatement,'' submitted by the borrower. Any amounts representing nonloanfunds deposited for construction under interim financing and not yet reimbursedwith loan or equity funds shall be excluded.(f) Encumbered funds generally shall not be considered available for newloan purposes.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1751.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cost allocation for rural and nonrural areas. </ITAG>(a) Pursuant to the requirements in 7 CFR Part 1745, if loan funds areproposed to be used to construct facilities to serve subscribers in nonruralareas, REA shall allocate costs between rural and nonrural areas. Thisallocation will be used in the determination of whether the use of loanfunds in nonrural areas is necessary and incidental to furnishing and improvingtelephone service in rural areas. Cost estimates shall be provided by theborrower in the LD. See 7 CFR Part 1749. REA will use the following methodsto review the cost breakdowns and to determine their appropriateness: (1) The costs of facilities associated directly with particular subscribersshall be allocated to those subscribers. (2) The costs of facilities that serve both rural and nonrural subscribersshall be allocated based on the relative number of rural and nonrural subscribersreceiving service from those facilities. (3) Where a borrower's exchange that includes a nonrural community willhave EAS with other exchanges of the borrower, the breakdown of subscribersand funds in the allocation for rural and nonrural areas included in theproposed loan shall show the number of rural and nonrural subscribers,and the costs to serve each group as determined per paragraphs (a)(1) and(a)(2) of this section, in both the subject exchange and in all exchangesconnected by EAS, as a whole. (b) If REA determines that costs cannot be adequately allocated using theprocedures in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, REA shall,on a case by case basis, allocate costs between the rural and nonruralsubscribers using whatever methodology it deems reasonable. Any such allocationshall be justified. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart D_Feasibility Study </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1751.30 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Description of Reasibility Study. </ITAG>(a) In connection with each loan REA shall prepare a feasibility studythat includes sections on consolidated loan estimates, operating statistics,projected telecommunications plant, projected retirement computations,and projected revenue and expense estimates, including detailed estimatesof depreciation and amortization expense, scheduled debt service payments,local service revenues, and toll and access charge revenues. Normally,projections will be for a 5-year period and used to determine the abilityof the borrower to repay its loans in accordance with the terms thereofand all other expenses. (b) REA makes loans only to rural telephone systems that are financiallyfeasible. REA shall consider the factors discussed in paragraph (c) through(g) of this section in determining feasibility. (c) The revenue and expense estimates for the feasibility study generallywill be based on the borrower's operating experience provided that: (1) Adjustments are made for any nonrecurring revenues and expenses thatare not representative of the borrower's past operations and would thusmake the borrower's experience data inappropriate for the forecast; and(2) Adjustments are made for any special or new characteristics or otherconsiderations deemed necessary by the Administrator. (d) The financial and statistical data are derived from REA Form 479, ``Financialand Statistical Report for Telephone Borrowers,'' or for initial loan borrowerswho have not reported on REA Form 479, the data may be obtained from theborrower's financial statements and other reports. (e) When the borrower's operating experience is not adequate, the estimatesin the feasibility study normally will be developed from state and regionalstandards based on the experience of REA telephone borrowers. These standardsare included in the Borrower's Statistical Profile (BSP), which is revisedannually by REA. If the borrower's operating experience is not the basisfor one or more per-subscriber estimates used in the feasibility study,the estimates generally may not vary from the standard by an amount inexcess of 20 percent to reflect the particular characteristics of the loanapplicant. Any variation from the standard shall be justified. (f) In cases where these per-subscriber standards do not represent a reasonableforecast of a particular borrower's operations (for example, when a variationgreater than 20 percent is necessary), estimates based upon a special analysisof the borrower's projected operations shall be used. The special analysiswill accompany the feasibility study. (g) When it is reasonably expected that a subscriber, classified as a specialproject, may discontinue service, a second feasibility study will be prepared,for comparison purposes, omitting revenues and expenses from this subscriber.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_Characteristics Letter </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1751.40</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Description of Characteristics Letter. </ITAG>(a) After all of the studies and exhibits for the proposed loan have beenprepared, but before the loan is recommended, REA shall inform the borrower,in writing, of the characteristics of the proposed loan. The purpose ofthe characteristics letter is to obtain the borrower's concurrence, beforeconsideration of loan approval and the preparation of legal documents relatingto the loan, in such matters as the amount of the proposed loan, its purposes,rate of interest, length of repayment period, local service rates requiredfor feasibility, loan security requirements, and other prerequisites tothe advance of loan funds. The letter, whether or not concurred in by theborrower, does not commit REA to approve the loan on these or any otherterms. (b) The Forecast of Revenues and Expenses and a copy of REA Form 493, ``TelephoneLoan Budget,'' shall be enclosed with the characteristics letter. Thiscopy of the budget shall be subject to change by REA with the borrower'sagreement.   <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Loan Approval</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1751.50</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan approval requirements.</ITAG>(a) In addition to requirements set forth in 7 CFR Part 1745, 7 CFR Part1749 and other applicable parts of 7 CFR Chapter XVII, the following arecertain additional requirements that must be met before REA will approvea loan.(1) If the borrower had 100 or more employees as of the prior December31, then it must have submitted the current annual Employer InformationReport EEO-1, Standard Form 100. The completion of this form is a Departmentof Labor requirement; see 29 CFR 1602.7 through 1602.14.(2) The borrower must be in compliance with regulations on nondiscrimination.See 7 CFR Part 1790 (or REA Bulletin 320-19).(3) For subsequent loans, REA must determine whether the borrower's accountingrecords are adequate. If the records are not adequate, as determined byREA, a provision will be included in the loan contract requiring the borrowerto improve its records to an adequate level.(4) As determined by REA, the local service rates used as the basis forloan feasibility must be appropriate to the area.(5) The borrower must not have any receivables, loans, guarantees, investments,or other obligations that are contrary to the mortgage provisions (See7 CFR Part 1758) or REA policy. If the borrower does have any of theseitems, the loan contract shall contain a provision requiring that theybe eliminated prior to the advance of funds.(6) REA must make a determination on flood insurance requirements.(i) In accordance with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub.L. 93-234) REA shall not approve financial assistance for acquisition orconstruction of buildings and equipment therein in an area identified bythe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as having specialflood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is thenparticipating in the national flood insurance program and the propertyowners obtain flood insurance as required under the Flood Act. Accordingly,a finding shall be made on whether loan funds will be used to finance buildingsor equipment located in a flood hazard area. If loan funds are to be usedin a flood hazard area, a provision restricting the release of funds willbe included in the loan contract.(ii) The REA field representative shall determine the exact location ofeach building that the borrower owns or occupies, or that it will constructor acquire, that is located within a flood hazard area and for each suchbuilding determine whether or not the community in which the building islocated or to be located is participating in the flood insurance program.(7) All environmental requirements must have been met by the borrower.See 7 CFR part 1794.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1751.51</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Approval.</ITAG>(a) A loan is approved when the Administrator, or whoever is delegatedauthority, signs the administrative findings and the letter to the borrowerannouncing the loan.(b) If the loan is not approved, REA shall notify the borrower, in writing,of the reasons for such a decision.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1751.52</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan Documents.</ITAG>Following approval of the loan, REA shall forward the necessary loan documentsto the borrower for execution, delivery, recording, and filing, as directedby REA.

Additional prerequisites may be addedon a case by case basis to a particular borrower's loan contract.(b) REA must approve a release of funds before any loan funds can be advanced.The release of funds is the determination that the borrower has compliedwith all of the conditions prerequisite to advances as set forth in theloan contract to the extent deemed necessary by REA for approval of theuse of loan funds and any required equity or other nonloan funds.(c) REA approves the release of funds only after it determines that allprerequisites to the advance of loan funds have been met or funds shouldbe advanced even though loan contract prerequisites remain unsatisfied.(d) Following approval, loan funds and related nonloan funds may be advancedin accordance with 7 CFR Part 1754.(e) The borrower may be required to discharge indebtedness and/or to closeacquisitions before advances can be made for construction purposes. Insuch cases, the borrower shall submit evidence that these actions havebeen completed. If the evidence is satisfactory to REA, REA shall allowthe remaining loan funds to be advanced in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1754.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1751.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Amounts spent for Preloan Activities.</ITAG>If the borrower desires to credit amounts spent for preloan activitiesagainst any equity or general funds required by the loan contract, it shallsubmit an itemized statement of such expenditures to the Area Office. IfREA determines that the amounts spent are reasonable and that the itemsare acceptable as preloan expenditures, they will be accounted for on REAForm 503, ``Release of Telephone Loan Funds.'' Statements of preloan expenditureswill be verified as to accuracy when loan fund audits are made by REA.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harold V.
