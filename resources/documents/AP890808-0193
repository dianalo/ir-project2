(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. computer manufacturerHewlett-Packard Co. has signed a technology-sharing agreement withSamsung Electronics Co. and intends to resell low-end workstationsbuilt by the South Korean company.   The move was seen as an effort by Hewlett-Packard to capturemore of the burgeoning worldwide market for workstations,high-performance desktop computers priced from $5,000 to $100,000.   By sharing technology on development of so-called reducedinstruction set computer semiconductor chips, Hewlett-Packard couldgain a competitive edge over rival manufacturers who are trying towin acceptance for their own RISC-based chips.   Hewlett-Packard is expected to devote it own manufacturingresources to ``high-margin'' workstations and other products, saidAndrew Allison, a writer who follows the workstation market,expected to reach $20 billion annually by 1992.   ``Samsung is a very credible low-cost alternative for HP,'' hesaid.   Hewlett-Packard rarely has resold computers built for it byothers, and the move indicates how serious HP is in fighting for ashare of the workstation market, Allison said.   Two weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard announced its first agreement toshare its computer technology in a deal with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan.The two will develop super-fast computer chips to be used incomputers manufactured by both companies.   Hewlett-Packard last year bought Apollo Computer, at the timethe second-largest maker of technical workstations.   Samsung Electronics, a division of South Korea's Samsung Group,manufacturers both semiconductor chips and computers. Samsung'scomputers are expected to be in the $12,000 range.   Sun Microsystems of Mountain View is among the major competitorto Hewlett-Packard over the RISC chip and computer market.   Hewlett-Packard plans to also share some advanced chip-makingtechniques with Samsung, as well as a version of the its Unixoperating system. Samsung has the right to independently marketproducts based on the technologies.</TEXT></DOC>
