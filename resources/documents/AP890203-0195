Alfredo Stroessner's long tenureas dictator ended because he tampered too much with the institutionthat propelled him into power 34 years ago: the military.   Stroessner tried to force his most powerful military leader, Gen.Andres Rodriguez, into retirement, and his recent shakeups of thearmy caused widespread resentment among his officers.   That, combined with Stroessner's ultimate plans to have his sonsucceed him as president, led to the violent coup that ended the76-year-old general's rule and vaulted Rodriguez to power on Friday.   ``Stroessner tried to take away some of the regiments controlledby Rodriguez and thus reduce his power _ a technique he (Stroessner)has used for years. But this time he committed a very bigindiscretion,'' Edgar Insfran, an interior minister for 10 yearsduring the 1950s and 1960s, said in an interview.   Rodriguez was bolstered by disaffected officers who resented areshuffling last month that resulted in the retirement of about 100army colonels and 35 navy captains, said opposition leader DomingoLaino, president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party and leaderof the National Accord opposition coalition.   ``(Rodriguez) took advantage of the general ill feeling withinmost of the military units to deal Stroessner a lethal blow,'' saidLaino, who returned in 1987 from a long period of exile and now isParaguay's best-known human rights activist.   Conflict between the two generals had been simmering since 1984,when the ruling Colorado Party split divisively into two factions:the militants who supported Stroessner unconditionally, and thetraditionalists who favored democratic reforms and a distancing ofthe 101-year-old party from the unpopular, authoritarian ruler.   Differences between Stroessner and Rodriguez reportedly came to ahead in 1987, when the militant faction wrested leadership of theparty from traditionalists by using strong-arm tactics, includingthe barring of traditionalist delegates from entering the congresswhere leaders were elected.   At that congress, Juan Ramon Chaves, in his 25th year as partychairman, was unseated by Sabino Montonaro, Stroessner's interiorminister. On Friday, Rodriguez replaced Chaves, 87, as chairman tothe cheers of 15,000 people who gathered outside the partyheadquarters.   In the five months since Stroessner underwent a prostateoperation, from which he has been slow to recover, his militantsupporters have promoted his son Gustavo, a lieutenant colonel inthe air force, to succeed him. That, too, alienated the military.   ``Rodriguez wanted to break away from the militant group that waspushing for the continuance of Stroessner line by saying, `AfterStroessner, Another Stroessner,''' said Laino.   In the perspective of Acevedo, ``The detonating factor was thethreat of retiring Rodriguez.''   In spite of the predominantly military motives for the rebellion,opposition leaders remain optimistic that Rodriguez could bringgreater democratization of Paraguay.   ``We have firm hopes ... a government of transition cannotsurvive without a democratic opening,'' said Euclides Acevedo of theRevolutionary Febrerista Party.   Other factors, such as Paraguay's deteriorating economy andStroessner's apparent failing health, played a role in the rebellion.   ``The military crisis alone could not have done this,'' said JuanCarlos Galaverna of the dissident Popular Colorado Movement. ``It'simportant to remember the real protagonists are the people and themilitary has simply been the instrument.''   Said Insfran, ``The military issue is over now. Now they have todeal with the political problem.''</TEXT></DOC>
