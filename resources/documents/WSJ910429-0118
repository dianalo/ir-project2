What he'slearned, he says, is to anticipate how opponents will try tooutmaneuver him -- and to bludgeon them.   Earlier this month, he finally drew blood. A measure toroll back several city taxes passed with 52%. Another, toforce any increases to go before the voters, got more than60% approval. The national tax revolt got new legs.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bruce's loud and lonely crusade in Colorado recallsnothing so much as Howard Jarvis's long struggle inCalifornia, which was capped by a massive propertytax cut in1978. Like the ornery Jarvis, who was also in therental-apartment business, Mr. Bruce has known defeat. Hefell just short last November with a statewide tax cut, aftera similar loss in 1988. He plans to be back on the Coloradoballot next year, this time trying simply to hold the line onspending and taxes.   He sets the terms of the state tax debate, but he's foundthere's no pleasing the civic establishment. One measure was&quot;vague and simplistic&quot; because it was drawn too broadly, Mr.Bruce recalls, another &quot;detailed and complicated.&quot; He wascriticized for excluding fees in one tax limit and subjectingthem to voter approval in the next. When he went statewide hewas destroying local control, but when he pressed the citycampaign he was undermining the chances of Colorado-widereform.   &quot;They will just say anything,&quot; he complains of his foes.They couldn't say enough to stop him in Colorado Springs.   He moved here from Los Angeles in the early 1980s. (He'dbeen a deputy DA and not involved with Mr. Jarvis there.)Shortly thereafter, the Springs, as it's called, went througha boom and bust related to arms and space programs, and itspopulation rested at 280,000. Mr. Bruce, meanwhile, spottedsubterfuge in the city fisc.   He concluded that officials had essentially moved capitalimprovements off budget during the growth spurt, allowing thecity to show only about a 20% real rise in spending from 1983to 1985. Much of the increase went toward salaries, which arenow quite generous in a town where many people enjoy neithergood pay nor job security.   The capital projects then drew on a &quot;temporary&quot; half-centsales tax. With Mr. Bruce's April 2 victory, this increase,which was extended in 1989, will &quot;sunset&quot; in 1994. Hisinitiative also phases out some &quot;nuisance&quot; excises and trimsthe propertytax rate by a quarter-mill even in the face oflower assessed valuations.   Thus he intends to discipline the public sector and itsretainers. Opponents claim he plays rough, ridiculingisolated examples of waste in a modest municipality. Someconservatives cringe at his blustery style. &quot;A lot of peoplehave the idea that you ought to campaign for tax limitationin a kinder and gentler way,&quot; he responds. &quot;We tried, but PeeWee Herman wasn't available.&quot;   Colorado Springs, he acknowledges, isn't the first placeyou'd go looking for profligacy. But it is rife withcontrasts. As elsewhere along the &quot;front range&quot; of theRockies, it is a magnet for high-tech firms andindividualists attracted to that field. (Somewhere nearby was&quot;Galt's Gulch,&quot; the fictional encampment of Ayn Rand's heroicproducer -- capitalists in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; -- Mr. Bruce'sfavorite book.) Yet the city and the region are heavy withgovernment work, much of it federal and military.   The Springs is home to nonprofit bodies such as the U.S.Olympic Committee and Junior Achievement, and to ColoradoCollege. Now it is becoming a center for newline Christiangroups; James Dobson's Focus on the Family is moving itsheadquarters here this year.   Newcomers are attracted, as Mr. Bruce says he was, by thearea's beauty, weather, cost of living and &quot;wholesome&quot;appeal. But overbuilding combined with job losses hasdecimated the economy, leaving it &quot;the foreclosure capital ofthe world,&quot; the tax-fighter says. His two-bedroom units gofor $400 a month or less, and he says some dilapidatedresidences can be bought for $5 a square foot.   Mr. Bruce blames local speculative excess partly on bonddealers who &quot;only make money when they put us into debt&quot; andwho, along with the rating agencies, have been obstacles topassing his tax measures. He says the cuts now approved forthe Springs won't hurt its finances. Any downgrades wouldn'taffect interest rates for bonds outstanding (unlessrefinanced), and any further issues would be backed by taxesexpressly approved by the voters.   Plebiscites are atop Mr. Bruce's agenda. He stresses&quot;citizen control&quot; because &quot;people feel powerless.&quot; It's onlyright, he says, that government spending not automaticallyrise faster than inflation plus population. As it is, &quot;Theytake their share off the top and put us on an allowance.&quot;   Part of the Bruce package in the Springs requires the cityto send out a &quot;Notice of Election to Increase Taxes&quot; (inlarge bold type outside the envelope) to each registrant, sonothing sneaks by. &quot;They're going to have a hell of a timegetting these tax increases when people get this ugly noticein the mail,&quot; he says with a laugh. Further, the ballotwording is to begin &quot;Shall city taxes be increased . . .&quot;instead of framing the question so as to advertise theprogram at stake and hide the cost in smaller type.   Bitter experience has him intent on writing the rules ofengagement so the opposition can't get away with &quot;lies.&quot; Forhis next statewide effort, he's contemplating sanctions onthose who use public funds or employee time to campaign.&quot;That's the main reason we keep losing: They use tax dollarsto propagandize. If it'd be just us against the specialinterests, we'd win.&quot;   Now that he's won in the state's second biggest city, heis even more a Colorado phenomenon. Renny Fagan, a Democraticlegislator from the Springs whom Mr. Bruce credits with beingan &quot;honest liberal,&quot; says his adversary has dominated thefiscal debate because few have been willing to stand up forhigher taxes to pay for &quot;quality of life&quot; services andprograms. Police and fire aren't likely to be affected by theBruce curbs (despite campaign rhetoric), but a real tusslemay come over an ice-skating rink, &quot;neighborhoodrevitalization&quot; projects, and heavily subsidized transit. Taxfoes generally object to such communal expenses, or at leastdemand that they be contracted out.   Colorado Springs should be a decent test of the merits oflimiting government. An hour up the road, by contrast, Denveris battling similar blues with a massive series of publicworks: a new airport, highways, convention center, baseballstadium, central library, school bonds and culturefacilities. (El Paso County, home to the Springs, turned downan arts tax of its own last November.) No wonder DouglasBruce is planning another march on the capital.   --   Mr. Ferguson is a Los Angeles-based member of theJournal's editorial board.</TEXT></DOC>
