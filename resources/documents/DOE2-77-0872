<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0872 </DOCNO><TEXT>Glasses in the yttria-silica system with 20-40 mol pct Y{sub 2}O{sub 3}have been subjected to recrystallization studies after melting at 1900-2100C in W crucibles in 1 and 50 atm N{sub 2}. The TEM and XRD results obtainedindicate the presence of the delta, gamma, gamma-prime, and beta-Y{sub2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 7} crystalline phases, depending on melting and quenchingconditions. Heat-treatment in air at 1100-1600 C increased the amountof crystallization, and led to the formation of Y{sub 2}SiO{sub 5}, cristobalite,and polymorphs of Y{sub 2}Si{sub 2}O{sub 7}. Also investigated were theeffects of 5 and 10 wt pct zirconia additions. 7 references.</TEXT></DOC>
