 The rangeof products was as expansive as could be seen at any show:andM;* The desktop market was represented at the low end by companies such asSpringboard Software and Digital Research, at the high end by Quark, Aldus,Xerox and Letraset, which unveiled its DesignStudio system targeted fortraditional graphic arts markets.andM;* For newspapers, most of the action centered on the display ad market,although several vendors showed other products also.andP;  Present were DigitalTechnology and System Integrators sharing a booth, Information International,Multi-Ad Services, Mycro-Tek, Newspaper Computer Systems and Synaptic MicroSolutions.andM;* Focusing on magazines and commercial markets were most of the key players,including Atex, Bestinfo, Information International/DocuPro, Itek Graphix,LaserMaker, Miles 33, Penta and Xyvision.andM;* Products aimed at traditional type shops were systems from Magna, Ultimateand Agfa CG.andM;* Technical documentation systems were well represented by Arbor Text,Datalogics, DocuPro/Information International, Frame, Interleaf, Kodak andXyvision.andM;* For book and journal publishing, there were Digital Publications Telos andPersonal Tex.andM;* Not only was a broad range of software demonstrated, but it was shown onnearly every platform available: Apollo running FrameMaker and IslandGraphics' se of applications, the Next Computer supporting FrameMaker, andmany programs for the Macintosh, PC and Sun Microsystems workstations.andP;  Infact, it appears that vendors are no longer content with running on a singleplatform.andP;  Most of the Unix vendors are talking about running on at least twodifferent workstations, as are some of the desktop system suppliers.andM;At important events like this one, we try to look for themes.andP;  Sometimesthere are major developments for the magazine market, or a surge inCALS-related activity or in some phase of newspaper editorial systems ordisplay ad software.andP;  But perhaps because of the expansiveness of the show orbecause of the times themselves, the main theme we found was the variety.andM;Letraset's move.andP;  As everyone is well aware, the distinctions between thedesktop publishing market and the high-end professional market are narrowing.andO;At the Conference, Letraset demonstrated the beginning of a new effort tojump from the former market to the latter one.andP;  The plan encompasses anentire family of products, called the Studio Line, of which one part is atext composition program.andM;We published a detailed report on te composition program, which is calledDesignStudio and is aimed at professional type and design markets, in theOctober issue of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.andP;  We felt that theinitial impact of that system will be primarily in the desktop field, whereDesignStudio quickly will give Quark Xpress and aldus PageMaker a run fortheir money because of its added typographic features and the integrationwith other members of the family.andM;Over the longer term, however, we believe there is a good chance that thisprogram will make significant inroads in more traditional markets.andP;  Keys tothis progression will be the addition of several specific features to theprogram, the development of some &quot;Annexes&quot; (Letraset's feature thatapproximates Quark Xtensions), and the widespread use of the DesignScriptlanguage.andM;Agfa CG enhances CAPS system.andP;  Agfa announced plans to move its CAPS systemto the Sun 4.0 operating system and that it will support the Sun-4, Sparc 390and SparcStation One workstations.andP;  Also new were an input/output server andan intelligent recognition system that we didn't have a chance to work with.andM;ArborText: competing with Frame?andM;It's been well over a year since we summarized ArborText's The Publisher aspart of our series on technical documentation systems (Vol.andP;  17, No.andP;  12).andO;Although the basic structure of the program remains the same, ArborText hasmade considerable improvements.andP;  Some of these were in its second release,introduced late last year.andP;  At the Conference, ArborText introduced version3.0, which has been modified to run under the X Window graphic environment(to support multiple platforms) and adds several significant features.andM;Apollo representatives noted how, with its new release, ArborText is in manyways a direct competitor with Frame.andP;  We are inclined to agree, although thetwo products remain distinct.andP;  ArborText's The Publisher is a structured SGMLeditor that formats typographically in the editor but shows the results ofcomposition and pagination in a preview.andP;  FrameMaker is a WYSIWYG compositionsystem that (in 2.0) offers better control over the composition of text andlets you edit text and graphics at any time directly on the page, but itlacks any notion of the underlying structure.andM;Although it does not carry the high profile of Frame, ArborText has beenselling well in universities, government and commercial scientific andresearch settings, where there is a strong base of Tex users and ArborText'sbuilt-in equations editor is seen as a vast improvement over EQN.andO;FrameMaker's new equations module may make its product more appealing to thismarket than before, but ArborText counters that its editor importsMathematica equations and uses Tex for its underlying math composition.andP;  Thecompany reports more than 8,000 registered users of The Publisher worldwide.andM;ArborText is attempting to broaden its appeal to include commercial technicalpublishers as well.andP;  It now supports the DoD document type definition forSGML (as well as the AAP one), which the company hopes to parlay into salesin the CALS market.andP;  As with Frame, its appeal to documentation publisherswill probably be as an editorial tool, rather than as a production system.andO;Although The Publisher may be used to produce final documents, it lacks thegraphics handling, version control and looseleaf pagination that manydocumentation publishers seek in a production system.andP;  For its part, Frame isalso developing tools to support the CALS initiative, which we'll note below.andM;Running under X. ArborText joins Frame, Interleaf and Xyvision in the club ofpublishing software vendors with software running under X, the windowingstandard supported by all of the major Unix workstation suppliers.andP;  Byrunning under X, rather than Sunwindows, ArborText will be able to port ThePublisher to a variety of platforms.andP;  It demonstrated its software running onApollo, which should be ready by early next year.andP;  A version for the HP 9000is planned for release later this year.andP;  The Sun version will continue to bethe one on which new releases are available first, at least in the nearfuture.andM;Hypertext links.andP;  ArborText (like Frame) usually sells to customers who runtheir publishing software in conjunction with other software on theworkstation, rather than as a dedicated publishing system.andP;  Undex X, this usewill be enhanced by the ability to run The Publisher in a window that may bemanipulated (sized and moved about the screen) the same as any other Xapplication on the workstation.andM;ArborText has added HyperLink, a new hypertext linking capability throughwhich you create dynamic links with information in other applications.andP;  Whilestill rare (only FrameMaker and DECwrite offer them), dynamic links arelikely to become much more prevalent in the 1990s.andP;  As the use of linksspreads, the need for an underlying compound document architecture willbecome apparent.andP;  So far, DEC is the only vendor that is providing such anarchitecture, which means that application vendors like ArborText and Framewrite their own specific linking and filtering mechanisms.andM;One distinct difference between The Publisher and FrameMaker is thatArborText uses SGML as its underlying data structure.andP;  Its links, forexample, are implemented as SGML attributes.andP;  This provides a convenientmeans for exporting the file to another system without embedding the links inthe text file.andP;  If the receiving system is not able to recognize theattributes, they may be ignored without affecting the basic content of thedocument.andM;HyperLinks are associated wit specific content elements--a paragraph, headingor footnote, for example.andP;  At this time, links are one-way paths to othersections of the same document or other documents (in Publisher or raw ASCII,such as an SGML file).andP;  The user inserts the link, which invokes the dialogbox asking for the point of reference.andP;  You must know in advance what thetarget document and tag name are, rather than being able to go to the targetto complete the link.andP;  However, it is now possible to open a second documentat the same time (or open the same document twice), which you could scrollthrough to find the target destination and tag.andM;With tags turned off, the system underlines the text that is the linkreference point to give the user a visual clue that a link is present.andP;  Theexploded view of the document (showing tags) shows the full link reference.andM;In FrameMaker, links are not hypertext pointers, they are merely hot buttonsto launch the source application.andP;  In The Publisher, you may tie actions to aHyperLink, which makes it possible to open another document as part of theprocess of following the link.andM;To demonstrate the capabilities of HyperLink in its system, ArborText used itto provide context-sensitive online help throughout its system.andM;Outlining.andP;  ArborText as added a smart outlining facility that enables you toview any level of detail in the document's hierarchy and to manipulateobjects at that level.andP;  For example, we rearranged and copied whole chaptersin ArborText's demo document from a view of the chapter level.andP;  We thenformatted the document and found that all of the automatic numbering andcross-references embedded throughout the file had been updated to reflect thechanges (see photo).andP;  The process of recalculating such changes is not asfast as we'd like, but the power of such a tool is compelling for authors ofmultiple-chapter documents.andM;Comparing different approaches to using SGML.andP;  From the start, The Publisherincluded the SGML parser from Software Exoterica in order to create astructured document editor.andP;  In Version 3.0, the parser is still hard-codedinto the system, which means that its context-sensitivity depends on a DTDthat is supplied by ArborText.andP;  In Version 4.0, ArborText.andP;  In Version 4.0,ArborText plans to inorporate Exoterica's XGML engine in a way that wouldsupport user-definable DTDs.andP;  That version will be fully compatible with 3.0.andM;The use of SGML as an underlying data structure simplifies tasks such asadding dynamic outlining, because the SGML file is a hierarchy of objects.andO;(Compugraphic's CAPS offers a similar capability.)andP;  It also guarantees theseparation of form from content, allows style characteristics to be inheritedfrom other elements rather than specified directly, provides a mechanism forincluding external graphics without filters and simplifies the task ofenforcing the underlying structure (through the use of a parser).andP;  Bysticking to SGML, ArborText is also able to ensure that new features such asits links do not interfere with processing the document for formatting on itssystem or on any other that can read an SGML file.andP;  As we discovered in ourlook at SoftQuad, it may present interesting possibilities for versioncontrol as well.andM;ArborText's approach differs from that of Frame, which intends to use theExoterica XGML engine to parse and validate files after they are created, notduring the editing session.andP;  Despite the technical diffuculties ofincorporating such an engine into the editor, we believe that doing soprovides considerable benefit to the writer or editor because it virtuallyeliminates the possibility of introducing errors during the editing process.andO;In a straight production system, such context-sensitivity may not benecessary, but in an editing tool the difference is readily apparent thefirst few times you have to clean up a file after you thought you werefinished.andM;Although WYSIWYG editing is possible in an SGML system (CAPS and Integraph'sDP/Publisher are good examples), The Publisher offers only a static preview,whereas Frame-Maker offers interactive editing of the formatted page.andP;  Thedebate over whether WYSIWYG editing is better than editing monospacedcharacters is one that individual customers must resolve for themselves.andP;  Butthe different approaches to SGML within a publishing system editor have yetto rise as an issue in the marketplace.andP;  Frame's CALS product is stillincomplete, so it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, but we hope toexplore this area next year as these products become available.andM;Graphics.andP;  The Publisher has always included the drawing and painting modulesdeveloped by Island Graphics as part of its software.andP;  Graphics and imageswere created in the Island modules, included by reference in the document,and shown in place in the editor and formatted in the preview mode ThePublisher offers.andP;  Now, in light of Island's decision to sell these productson Apollo (and maybe other) workstations under its own label and ArborText'sdecision to modify its software to run under X, ArborText has decided todecouple graphics from its proram.andM;In Version 3.0, all graphics will still be treated as referencedobjects--that is, the graphic itself is not part of the document, only areference to the graphic that resides somewhere else.andP;  Initially, ArborTextwill support the Island drawing and painting formats as well as PostScript(with or without the encapsulated header).andP;  It will support scaling androtating of encapsulated PostScript graphics and will display those graphicsas they will appear on output as part of the formatted preview.andM;This technique is in distinct contrast with Frame, which provides its owndrawing tools that may be used directly on the page.andP;  In The Publisher, rulesand boxes are offered as style options for text elements, rather than beingdrawn by hand.andP;  Which method works best depends entirely on user preferencesand applications.andM;Other details on version 3.0.andP;  Other enhancements in the new release of ThePublisher include support for conditional statements in its command line;customizable keyboards; landscape pages in a portrait document; and theability to turn formatting off for selected portions of a document.andM;The price of The Publisher was upped from $1,995 to $3,495 at its lastrelease last year.andP;  Current users with a maintenance contract get the upgradefor free; otherwise the upgrade is $1,750.andM;Archetype reaches a plateauandM;Archetype had its own booth, rather than relying on OEM customers anddistributors to demonstrate the system as it has done at most recent shows.andO;And it had a prime spot, right in the front row.andP;  The booth tended to becrowded; it appears that the industry finally has come to view Designer as aviable product.andP;  A version of it also was shown in the Atex booth, where theapplication was magazine page makeup.andP;  The Atex booth was where the news was.andO;Archetype hadn't added any key features to its own Designer system.andM;Atex/EPPS in beta testingandM;Atex, which has split its newspaper and magazine operations into separategroups, demonstrated the latest version of its PC Page Makeup system based onArchetype's layout program integrated with Atex's Writer Software (acustomized version of XyWrite III Plus).andP;  Themost significant news istwofold:andM;* Whne a story is handamp;j'ed from within Writer Software, the handamp;j process runsagainst the layout of the page to which the story is assigned, if it has beenassigned to a page.andM;* Beta testing is well under way, with an official product launch expectedlater this fall.andP;  The beta customer is Whittle Communications, of Tennessee,which produces a variety of publications, including some that are commonlysupplied for doctors' waiting rooms.andP;  Initially the system--which will be thefirst Atex system installed without a J-11 Applications Server--will be usedto produce the quarterly Best of Business.andM;But there was other news also, including further developments to the WriterSoftware package and the Design Software that recently was acquired fromMedia Solutions.andM;Magazine/newspaper split.andP;  The magazine operation within Atex has been splitfrom the newspaper organization.andP;  The new Atex Magazine Publishing Systemsoperation is headed by Ron Matros, vice president and general manager, whohad beenin charge of the magazine effort when it was part of the newspapergroup.andP;  He reports to Rick Feldt, an EPPS vice president.andM;Atex Newspaper Systems has been unaffected by the change, aside from losingthe magazine operation.andP;  Harland LaVigne continues as president, with AgnesImregh as vice president, marketing.andP;  Alec Hollingsworth was recently namedvice president of North American operations, filling the position held byLaVigne before he was named president two months ago.andP;  In another recentappointment, Gary Moore became vice president and general manager of AtexNewspaper Color Systems.andM;Atex said the change was intended to give the magazine unit a betteropportunity to focus on the increasingly special needs of magazine customers.andM;Both the magazine and newspaper groups remain within Kodak's ElectronicPre-Press Systems (EPPS) unit, which is the largest organization withinKodak's Commercial and Information Systems Group.andP;  Other entities within EPPSare the Electronic Printing Systems unit, which is responsible for theDesignmaster 8000 color system and the Preview soft-proofing system; KodakLegal Systems; and Eikonix, the producer of scanners, although the Eikonixoperation is virtually inactive.andP;  It has been for sale, although no deal hasbeen worked out yet.andM;Writer Software.andP;  Key new features for the PC-based Writer Software are:andM;* Many more help screens, which are accessed conveniently by name or throughmenus.andM;* The ability to customize for individual users which programs get loadedwhen they log on to the system.andM;* Edit tracing, based on redlining to show which changes were made by eacheditor.andP;  Also supported is the creation of &quot;.hst&quot; files to record who editeda file and when it was edited.andM;* Support for multiple printers based on menus.andM;* The ability to have the spelling checker (and any other optional programmodules) automatically unloaded after it is used to free the memory for otherapplications, plus the ability to have part of the spelling dictionary inmemory and part on disk to provide more efficient useof memory.andM;PC Page Makeup.andP;  We already had seen Writer Software PCs accessing the SunMicrosystems file server for handamp;j, but for the first time, Atex demonstratedthe ability of the system to link a file being composed from a PC workstationto the layout prepared on the PC Page Makeup station.andP;  The handamp;j process takesinto account column measure, text runarounds and other layout factors when itjustifies the story.andP;  Unlike Bestinfo's Wave4 system, which requires the userto specify the page to which the story has been assigned, Atex looks at thestory header to find the page without operator intervention.andM;When the story returns to the Writer workstation, the screen shows the columnand page breaks as horizontal lines at the appropriate locations.andP;  It alsoflags loose lines.andP;  To indicate how the story depth compares with the layout,the user scrolls to the end of the story and looks to see if the text isoverset or underset.andP;  As of the show, there was no report telling how manylines short or long the story is, but Atex said later that this feature wouldbe added.andM;As we have reported before, if handamp;j is done at the layout workstation, ittakes place in the PC.andP;  If handamp;j is done fro ma Writer Software station, ittakes place in the Sun fule server, which is connected to the PC viaEthernet.andP;  All formats and page layouts are stored in the server so they canbe accessed by any device on the network.andP;  Thus, when a change is made to thelayout, other PCs on the network won't know about it until it is stored bythe Page Makeup PC.andM;File locking has been implemented to prevent a Writer station editor and aPage Makeup operator from changing the same story simultaneously.andP;  the wayAtex has set up the locking function, all stories on the page are locked whena Page Makeup operator calls up the page.andP;  If any of the stories assigned tothe page are already open on other PCs, those stories appear greeked on thescreen and can't be edited by the layout operator, although the layout can bechanged.andP;  We suggested that Atex consider supporting a mode in which allstories weren't automatically locked when the page was called up by the PageMakeup operator.andP;  This would enable a Page Makeup operator to check thelayout, manipulate photos, and so on, while editors made changes to storiesas needed.andP;  This can be done now by &quot;unlinking&quot; the story to the page, butthen it can't be handamp;j'ed against the layout for copyfitting.andP;  We alsosuggested a read-only mode fr editors while a page is being manipulated.andM;As the beta site, Whittle has four PC Page Makeup workstations and 12 WriterSoftware PCs, configured on two networks with a bridge.andP;  Just after theConference, Whittle planned to go live with its first publication.andM;Atex said the first formal release of software, called 1.0, would be ready inthe middle of October.andM;Design Software.andP;  The main changes to the Macintosh-based Design Softwareproducts developed by Media Solutions and recently acquired by Atex (see lastissue, page 40) relate to interfaces.andP;  Although the system wasn't interfacedto any other systems at the Conference, Atex said it is now running linked toScitex and to Atex J-11 systems.andP;  A link to a PC Page Makeup system won't beready until next year, although it might be demonstrated as early as theFolio show the week after this issue comes out.andM;When interfaced to a Scitex system, Design Software outputs page geometryfiles, turning display type into line art.andP;  The user at the Macintosh canspecify the resolution desired and the pages to send.andP;  when linked to an Atexsystem, the Macintosh can generate composition formats only or it can createa MagPage specification file also.andP;  although the only link to a color systemthat Atex ahs refined is to Scitex, other ones will follow, making DesignSoftware more flexible in that respect than, for example, the ScitexVisionary product.andM;DP Telos previews version 2.5andM;Digital Publications Telos has continued to expand the new batch paginationcapabilities it demonstrated as version 2.4 at Type-X in April, coming upwith a collection that will be released in a couple of months as version 2.5.andO;The emphasis at the show was on facilities for handling directory work andcapabilities associated with the system's programming language.andM;Telos was demonstrating the use of &quot;vertical zones&quot; for constructingsidenotes, in addition to side heads that were shown at Type-X.andM;New features in 2.5 include:andM;* User-defined path names.andP;  A user can specify the location of configurationfiles, dictionary files and font width tables, making it possible for eachuser to have his own macros loaded when he logs in.andM;* New counters.andP;  Counters for the value of the current column depth and thefolio number are now available, which enables conditional tasks to beimplemented only if the column depth conforms to the prescribed amount.andM;* Arithmetic operations on counters.andP;  It is now possible to performarithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply and divide) on counters.andM;* Outputting elements to multiply files.andP;  Two new commends allow the user tochannel information from a paginated file into any of nine other files, suchas in generating an index.andP;  In this case, the user would mark the beginnigand end of each word or phrase that is t be saved in a file for use inproducing an index.andP;  It also could be used in reverse order to suppressoutput of certain elements.andM;* Forced justification.andP;  There are now two ways to force a line to justify:one modifying interword spacing and one not modifying interword spacing.andM;Telos was showing its &quot;vertical zone&quot; capability, in which up to eightcolumns of variable whidth (and additional columns of fixed widths) can beused for composing multiline text.andP;  The system composes text for one column,returns to the horizontal starting point and composes text for anothercolumn, and so on until the end of the line is reached, at which point itadvances beyond the deepest column to be ready for the next horizontal row.andO;For handling sidenotes, the system moves to the margin, composes the note,and returns to the appropriate position within the next.andM;Although we weren't given any new sales figures for the American market,Telos did say that it has established 14 dealerships in the U.S., coveringespecially the east and west coasts, and that the first system on a networkwill be installed soon at a book publisher's site in San Francisco.andP;  It willuse a Novell network.andM;DTI SpeedPlanner slow to arriveandM;In his speech to the Conference attenders, Frank Romano denounced the use ofthe word &quot;near,&quot; as in &quot;near-typeset quality.&quot;andP;  What the word means, he said,is not.andP;  Alas, Digital Technology fell into the &quot;nearc category: ItsSpeedPlanner was demonstrated in the &quot;nearly ready to ship&quot; class.andP;  This&quot;front-end&quot; or &quot;editorial&quot; approach to pagination has been eagerly awaited bymany people for the better part of a year.andP;  Many of the smaller publicationscan afford to have one person, sitting at one terminal, make up an entirepage.andP;  However, for larger publications with more stringent deadlines, thisis difficult.andP;  Timing constraints require that the page be laid out inadvance and that copy editors, working in parallel, simultaneously fit copy(different stories) to the page.andP;  This is the goal of SpeedPlanner, whichruns on Macintosh computers.andM;SpeedPlanner is now in the beta testing.andP;  The code is frozen and only thedebugging phase remains.andP;  The best guess at this stage is that it will beready for initial deliveries soon--perhaps even this month.andM;Anyone looking for deliverable new products from Digital Technology found thecolor AdSpeed system.andM;The show provided an excellent opportunity to talk to Digital Technology andSystem Integrators, which were sharing the booth, regarding their futureplans.andP;  In the case of Digital Technology, it is too early to talk aboutspecific plans, but we expect that the work being done at the company'sheadquarters in Utah will be widely appreciated--if it proceeds as planned.andO;This is some very exciting stuff, so stay tuned!andM;Meanwhile, SII was talking about its plans, although there wasn't much toreport on the technical issue of tying their systems together in a &quot;seamlessway.&quot;andP;  February 1 is the target date for some of this integration--theinitial release of the integrated graphic database.andP;  In fact, despite initialplans that called for separate databases for text and graphics, SII hasdecided to keep them as one logical unit.andP;  Another change since ANPA is thatSII has decided to keep the classified pagination product on the PC, ratherthan move it to the Mac.andM;SII has realized the potential of this part of the business and has set up acompletely separate business unit to concentrate on the display ad andgraphics products--with DTI at its center.andP;  Under the direction of Tony Yung,this organization will be called the Image Business Unit.andP;  Among otherthings, it have its own dedicated sales force.andM;FrameMaker poised for deliveryandM;There were some enhancements to the 2.0 version of FrameMaker that waspreviewed at the Seybold Seminars last March, but the biggest news was thatthe release is nearly ready to be shipped.andP;  We were told that the code hadbeen frozen and that October was the target for first deliveries.andP;  We expectto get a copy for evaluation at the same time as initial customers, so wewill plan for a full review soon.andM;Meanwhile, Frame showed a few nice changes.andP;  First, the math program, whichis characterized by its ability to solve equations as well as to enable anoperator to construct them easily, has been simplified by dividing the mathfunctions into eight windows, rather than including them all on the same one.andO;Each window has the list of available windows at the bottom, so the user canselect any other window easily.andP;  They are symbols, operators, large,delimiters, relations, calculus, matrices and functions.andM;The footnote program also has been completed.andP;  It supports footnotes incolumn or page width, numbering continuously through a chapter or starting anew sequence on each page, splitting notes across pages if they are too longto fit, and a maximum height a footnote can use on a page.andP;  It alsohighlights the footnote if a footnote reference falls within a block of textthat is highlightened.andP;  Footnotes can be placed only at the bottom of a page,not at the end of a chapter.andM;Ligature generation has been added for the FL and FI character sequences,although ligatures aren't displayed on the screen.andM;The screen display has been improved by implementing the Folio font scalingroutine.andM;One item that hasn't been put into release 2.0 is tabular composition, whichis now the top priority for the next version.andM;Information International/DocuProandM;The Conference marked the first showing of Information International'sDocuPro Professional Publisher/2 since the product's recent release byTriple-I, and the first time Qubix's illustration system had been shown sinceit was acquired earlier this year.andP;  On hand were the latest software releaseof the DocuPro line and an extension to the Qubix Leonardo product.andM;Professional Publisher/2, the first implementation of systems coming fromTriple-I via DocuPro, is targeted at general corporate publishing as well asconventional publishing.andP;  The next development will be the systemspecifically targeted at the magazine market using a layout-driven approachrather than the interactive approach of the current implementation.andP;  Themagazine package will have specific functions like jump pages.andP;  This will befollowed by a catalog implementation, and finally a full tech-doc packagewith CALS compliance and document revision management.andP;  No dates have beengiven for these implementations.andM;As we reported earlier, Professional Publisher/2 is a major development ofthe earlier product.andP;  It is sold as a basic package, plus a range ofextra-cost options: decimal alignment in tabular work, spot color, revisionbars, cross-referencing, book file structures, and a drawing package.andP;  Thesystem runs on Sun-3/60 and 3/80 workstations under Unix 4.0.3.andP;  It usesDocuPro's own operating environment.andM;The system is built around objects.andP;  Each object, be it text, graphics,images, geometric art, or whatever, has an attached lists of properties thatcan be used to give very accurate system control.andP;  The properties of anyobject can be viewed and altered.andP;  The use of an object-driven systempermitted DocuPro to add properties to some objects, such as color, which canbe applied to any object.andP;  Custom palettes with 128 colors per object can becreated based on CMYK, CMY, RGB or HSV models.andP;  Individual color values canbe easily adjusted via sliders on the screen.andP;  The system does not handle acolor matching system such as Pantone's.andP;  Color can be spot or process, andthe system allows for the definition of screen angles.andP;  It does not handlescanned color images, although a future link between the DocuPro and Triple-IAMS product lines is likely.andM;The text program is reasonably good, supporting editable kern tables of up to1,000 pairs, vertical justification with a 10-level try table, and full widowand orphan control with automatic pagination.andP;  Handamp;j is based on the optimumrather than the minimum space.andP;  There are excellent indenting functions,including inside and outside indents, and tabular functionality.andM;There is a new facility for graphical alignment, which provides for nineautomatic locations for each graphic element origin, including top and bottombaselines.andP;  With auto locator, one has an automatic alignment tool.andM;The system supports generic coding using a subset of SGML,  and it can importand export full SGML data.andM;Currently lacking are automatic tracking by type sizes, a program forcomposing mathematics, and a report of pages that have failed to reach therequired quality level during batch pagination.andM;The basic system costs $2,500; this figure is increased to $6,000 (softwareonly) when a complete set of options is added.andP;  Triple-I hopes to run onSun's Sparc workstations next March, when version4.1 of Sun's operatingsystem is available.andP;  The system currently only outputs PostScript, and itcan also import PostScript, converting it into a bitmap graphic viaTriple-I's PostScript software interpreter.andP;  There are plans to bring theDocuPro and Triple-I product lines together, but there are no dates beingtalked about for this.andM;The Leonardo graphic package is now available as software alone, as softwareplus Sun-3 hardware, or on the Qubix-unique work surface with the monitormounted as part of a drawing board, with a specialized drawing pen, asdemonstrated many times over the years.andM;The basic software is the same on both.andP;  Last year, Qubix endeavored to sellLeonardo as a Sun equivalent of Adobe Illustrator.andP;  This it certainly is not,but it is a very pricese technical drawing system.andP;  As we have noted in thepast, it uses its own windowing environment with fixed tool and commandwindows.andP;  It has a fixed window at the side of the screen with all the basicfunctions.andP;  When any of these functions are selected, windows open for therequired tasks.andP;  The function keys on the keyboard can be used instead.andP;  Thesystem is still monochrome only, but there are plans to offer multiple spotcolors in the first quarter of 1990.andM;The system differs from the normal illustration system by having the specifictools for the technical illustrator to handle diometric and triometric views,plus the ability to define a reference point for alignment of differentobjects, rotation, etc.andP;  There are also six specific pen types for differenttypes of drawing, plus accurate drawing tools such as protractors and customrulers, where a ruler can be used as a drawing constraint.andP;  The system hasalso been enhanced so that it now has reasonably comprehensive compositionfunctions using Bitstream fonts, and full handamp;j in up to eight languages.andO;There are also good tabular setting functions.andM;Output is in either PostScript or Triple-I V-Bit.andP;  V-Bit is used as a linkbetween the Leonardo and AMS display ad systems.andM;The system is currently sold predominantly into the technical illustrationarea, but it is being aimed also at graphic arts illustrators.andP;  With itscompositon, it is also being seen as suitable for single-page data sheets ina technical documentation or marketing evvironment.andP;  The software is pricedat $2,500.andM;Itek Graphix moves on two frontsandM;Itek Graphix Composition Systems, a division of A.B.andP;  Dick, had someadditions to its Designitek and InPrint systems.andP;  (The latter had been anA.B.andP;  Dick product before the acquisition of Itek Graphix, but it has beenmerged into the composition product line.)andM;Designitek.andP;  Designitek, which has been running only on the Sun386iworkstation, has been ported to the SparcStation, although this wasn'tdemonstrated.andM;Besides new composition functions, the Designitek now supports the Xerox 7650monochrome scanner, which Itek Graphix sells at the Designitex XL ImageScanner.andP;  It comes in a package with a 20-MHZ '386 PC for $24,995.andP;  Thepackage will include some additional software features developed by ItetkGraphix, in the areas of pixel editing, tracing and so on.andP;  The firstshipments are expected in three to six months.andM;The Designitek also supports the Microtek 400G scanner, which is availablefor $14,995.andM;Composition enhancements to the Designitek include alignment of tabs based ondecimals or any other character, plus the use of a menu to set up tabs bydragging a point across the screen; outlining and tinting of text characters;a menu for generating certain page elements (margins, number of columns,gutter size and rule thickness between gutters), which can be saved as a fileand reused later; the ability to trace images on the screen to create masks;and handamp;j of text using as many as 20 different languages at once, evendefining individual words as different languages.andM;Two capabilities not yet implemented are automatic generation of page numbersand automatic insertion of running headers and footers.andM;InPrint.andP;  A few key developments have been added to the InPrint program,including generation of round-cornered boxes and importing of graphic filesin TIFF format.andP;  Also new are:andM;* Editing window.andP;  A window has been added for fast editing of text to avoiddelays often experienced with WYSIWYG displays--delays that can cause InPrintto lose text if typing is too fast.andP;  All text appears in 10-point size in thetext window, with lines wrapping within the bounds of the window.andP;  The sizeof the editing window can be changed by the user.andP;  After completion ofediting, the text is handamp;j'ed as it flows back onto the WYSIWYG screen.andP;  Theamount of text that can be contained in the window is currently limited bylocal memory size, but a later release will alleviate this problem.andM;* Fast commands and hot keys.andP;  Five sets of four frequently used commands,ordinarily accessed through multiple menus, can be displayed for quick use.andO;If they are stored, they appear again in the same location as previously.andO;Also added are &quot;hot&quot; keys that bypass the mouse and menus to accessfunctions.andM;* Code translation.andP;  The code-conversion capability formerly used with thePTW system has been added to InPrint.andP;  It provides excellentstring-for-string translation to enable importing text from most wordprocessors, plus some nice additional functionality for customizingtranslations.andM;InPrint now sells for $17,995 as a complete system (PC, high-resolutionmonitor, scanner, laser printer and software), or $47,995 with an ItekGraphix 7000PS output recorder.andM;Magna adds footnotes, new featuresandM;The most visual new capability Magna demonstrated in its 3.2 software releaseis automatic placement of footnotes.andP;  But also useful are some other changes,including the ability to support 128K of expanded memory, a RAM disk for somefunctions, spot color assignments, a &quot;delay&quot; command to cause one action totrigger another at a later time (such as in creating small caps, droppedinitial caps, or certain procedures after a headline), scaling or tiling ofoversized pages on output to a proof printer, the ability to reset the x/yposition to 0 to move relatively to the current position, and a selectablehalftone dot for PostScript output.andP;  Some other items not demonstrated butplanned for inclusion in the release are the ability to output selectedpages, the ability to save a file in EPS format, and a few special effectsfor PostScript: tints, round-cornered boxes, outline type and droppedshadows.andM;Footnotes.andP;  The footnote program, based on the capability that was developedfor the CCI system that preceded Magna, requires that footnotes be stored ina separate file from the main text.andP;  Up to 500 footnotes can be used perchapter, numbered sequentially through a chapter or with the sequencerestarted on each page.andM;The user handamp;j's the footnote file when it is stored and embeds footnotereferences in the text file.andP;  When the text file is handamp;j'ed, the systemcalculates where to place the notes, based on the Handamp;j'ed depth.andP;  It inserts aflag at the bottom of the column.andP;  To see the contents of the footnote, theoperator can call for it to be displayed at the top of the screen, similar tothe way the contents of stored formats are displayed by Magna.andM;The program supports different styles of footnotes, automatically placesrules as separators, and allows the notes on the last page of a chapter toappear at the top or the bottom of the page.andP;  It supports page-wide as wellas column-wide notes, plus breaking long footnotes across pages.andP;  And it ispossible to use the same note multiple times within a document.andM;Although the program looks quite capable and the basic features appear to bewell implemented, we noted several functions that would make it morecomplete.andP;  The main one is that it would be nice to be able to type the textof the note within the main text file, which isn't possible.andM;Two other functions have been added since the show, Magna has told us.andP;  Theyare the ability to place all of the notes for a chapter at the end of thechapter and a means to limit the height footnotes can use on a page.andM;Release 3.2 is in beta testing now and is scheduled for completion by the endof the year.andM;Miles 33's PageMake in beta testandM;Miles 33 showed its new magazine software, PageMake, which should beinstalled at a beta test site (Mates Graphics, in Clifton, NJ) by the timethis Report is printed.andP;  The software, which runs on Sun workstations,automates many of the functions of assembling magazine pages in a productionenvironment.andP;  It can be used for pre-dummied pages as well as pages designed&quot;on the fly&quot; during production.andM;Mates Graphics, which offers production services to magazines, uses bothapproaches according to the needs of the client.andP;  Mates produces about 25magazines a week.andM;The Miles magazine approach is very much like traditional magazine pasteup.andO;This similarity is intentional, based on the theory that the system will fitsmoothly into an existing magazine production environment.andM;The process generally begins with the creation of page grids.andP;  Thesecorrespond to the blue-line grids often used in conventional pasteup, showingthe placement of columns, baselines, gutters, headings, footings, crop marksand rules.andP;  These grids can be stored in an electronic library until they areneeded.andP;  A magazine can have several different grids for different types ofpages.andM;After the selection of a grid, or a series of them, type is placed on thepage.andP;  Type can be pasted from column to column and page to page in a mannersimilar to that used in conventional pasteup.andP;  The process can be done with amouse.andP;  But sometimes it is easier, when working from a recise dummy, to workfrom measured positions.andP;  In the situation, positions can be indicated bytyping in coordinates instead.andP;  Measurements can be made with the use'schoice of increment.andP;  For example, you can work with picas horizontally andlines vertically.andP;  Onscreen rulers reflect these units.andM;Various levesl of zoom are available, allowing various numbers of pages to beviewed and worked with simultaneously.andP;  Once text has been placed in a seriesof columns or pages, it can be adjusted, and the adjustments will flowthrough to the end of the text.andM;A very useful feature is the ability to flow from the back of the textforward.andP;  This allows the &quot;jump&quot; text of articles to fill the back pagessolid, leaving more white space to work with on the opening page or spread.andM;Text flows automatically around rectangular shapes, but not yet aroundirregular ones.andP;  This feature will be added.andM;The software being delivered to Mates will not include widow/orphan control.andO;Unlike Miles's automatic pagination software, which has sophisticatedwidow/orphan avoidance and tries to be clever about avoiding the need foroperator intervention, this package is meant to be straightforward and highlyinteractive.andP;  It was decided that automatic widow/orphan avoidance would belikely to interfere with the direct control that the operator needs.andM;Miles is readying a new packag, PC Link, which was not shown in SanFrancisco.andP;  This will allow publishers using virtually any word processor tosend files into a Miles system for composition.andP;  A header at the beginning ofthe file tells the system what steps to perform (typically, handamp;j to a specificset of parameters and return the file).andP;  The steps take place automatically,in the background.andP;  The returned file shows true line endings, includinghyphens, and it can provide feedback on loose lines, depth and othercomposition factors.andP;  We look forward to seeing PC Link in action.andM;MonoText's first U.S.andP;  showingandM;Monotype' Typography, which had a separate booth from Monotype, used theoccasion for the first U.S.andP;  showing of the MonoText system that we reviewedin our article on Monotype (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  18, pp.andP;  17-20).andP;  MonoText, ajoint venture between Monotype and the Swedish trade typesetting companyTextData, bases its system on '386 PCs with high-resolution monitors and aversion of the Advent 3B2 software composition program.andM;But the most notable characteristic of the system, as we stated in ourearlier comments, is that it is aimed at the top-quality commercial market.andO;With this goal, the system includes extensive kerning tables that range fromabout 2,500 pairs to 6,000 pairs per font, a kerning routine that takes intoaccount word spaces as well as text characters, tracking in six degrees, along list of ligatures, justification based on the optimum interword spacevalue, etc.andP;  Hung punctuation hasn't been implemented yet, but it is planned.andM;One of the attractive aspects of the product is that it uses true fonts onthe screen, generated on the fly from outlines, so the effects of kerning andtracking are visible.andM;The first installation took place in England early in September.andP;  We weretold that the formal launching of the product in Sweden and Norway would takeplace soon after the Conference.andM;MonoText is currently looking for representaton in the U.S.andP;  Although severalquality-oriented European systems have failed to penetrate the Americanmarket (including Scangraphic's and Berthold's), this one has the appeal ofits PC platform.andP;  It would be nice to see it succeed.andM;Multi-Ad Creator adds handamp;jandM;For several months we've been working on a review of MultiAd Service'sMacintosh-based Creator system for creating display ads, which has aroused alot of attention at various levels of the newspaper market.andP;  We delayed ourreview in anticipation of some new features that were previewed at theConference and will be ready for release soon.andP;  So, rather than report indetail what these new features include, we will save them for our upcomingreport.andP;  But we will say that the product new has some of the items we havebeen waiting for, including real formating and automatic hypenation.andM;Mycro-Tek's AdWriter, Quark linkandM;One of a dozen or so vendors of newspaper systems to exhibit, Mycro-Tekdemonstrated version 2.2 of its AdWriter program.andP;  The main features are theability to export ads in EPS format, which is useful when ads are to bepaginated using Quark Xpress; the ability to create masks around images, withuser-defined halos so they can be placed on other backgrounds; and variableline screens when outputting to high-resolution recorders.andM;Mycro-Tek also announced that its first MasterPlanner page dummying systemwould be installed soon after the Conference.andM;Finally, Mycro-Tek elaborated on its plans for using Xpress as the paginationengine for its newspaper system.andP;  It is writing a Quark Xtension to cover themain requirements that aren't in the basic program, such as backflowingclassified ads (start at the back of a section and flow them forward) andoutputting selected portions of a page in tile fashion, rather than having tooutput complete pages every time.andM;When files from the Mycro-Comp system are sent to Quark for pagination,Mycro-Tek said it will be possible to re-handamp;j only a section, with the programhonoring line endings from the Mycro-Tek system.andM;NCS shows new class ad systemandM;Newspaper Computer Systems, of Victoria, Texas, says it has installed morethan 100 class ad systems, mostly in its home state.andP;  Some of the others arein Kansas Alabama, Georgia, Washington, Louisiana, Alaska, Florida, NewMexico, Nebraska and North Carolina.andM;It was making its first major showing, demonstrating a brand-new release ofclass ad software running on a PC.andP;  It also showed the rest of its&quot;Newsware&quot;: applications for circulation, carrier billing, total marketcoverage, display advertising/accounts receivable, classifiedadvertising/accounts receivable and accounts payable.andM;The program runs on a Novell network with a dedicated server.andP;  Files aredumped to Ventura Publisher for composition and pagination.andM;It provides many of the basic functions, including access to records by phonenumber, scheduling by typing the start/end dates or each date an ad is to run(but without a calendar display), and a window for typing the text of the adon the screen.andM;Billing is by word now, since the line-breaking algorithm doesn't produce thesame results as will be achieved on final output.andP;  The screen shows thecompany's balance, updated at billing time, plus tearsheets required,discount type, credit limit, and so on.andM;The program doesn't provide for credit card payments.andM;Penta lowers entry price pointandM;Penta used the Conference as a launching pad for its new PC-based,entry-level system.andP;  Starting at under $30,000, it offers most of thecapabilities and excellent composition Penta has been known for.andM;The system uses a typical PC architecture with a file server and an Ethernetlink connecting the PC to it.andP;  It differs from many at the file server.andP;  Thefile server is naturally a Data General product, called the MV/1000DC.andP;  Itcan be configured with up to 12 MB of memory, along with a 322-MB disk.andP;  Thefile server is also the application processor (Penta didn't rewrite all theapplication code to run directly within the PCs).andP;  It supports up to 10 PCs,which run under Windows.andP;  They are connected to the MV/1000DC via an Ethernetlink running TCP/IP.andM;However, the DG file server, using what Data General calls Personal ComputerIntegration (PCI), also supports StarLan and has recently announced supportfor Token Ring as well.andM;Penta showed multiple applications (editing, scanning software, etc.) workingin multiple windows, each working off the main file server's disk.andP;  For now,the system works with a single server.andP;  A multiple-server configuration isplanned for release later this fall, possibly in time for Graph Expo.andP;  Outputwas also set up for PostScript--acknowledging the type of Conference and theaudience.andM;On the both side of its booth, Penta demonstrated a more conventionalconfiguration.andP;  Instead of the local area network scheme using Ethernet, thesecond configuration had an MV file server at the enter of a starconfiguration, with individual serial links tying each (nonwindow) terminalto it.andP;  Here, applications such as layout were shown running on both the DG7500 and a PC.andM;On the feature side, Penta demonstrated a new &quot;single page editing&quot;capability for its MasterPage software.andP;  This capability in essence providesfor partial handamp;j and output of any defined portion of a page.andP;  Itsignificantly reduces the time for making small corrections, recomposingportions of pages, and quickly getting them typeset (a feature Pentacustomers have been waiting for).andM;Personal Tex adds new previewandM;Personal Tex, which has been offering its PCTex program with a soft-copypreview developed by ArborText, now has its own preview, which it claims is15-20% faster than the former one and provides easier font handling.andP;  CalledPTIView, it uses the same fonts as the printer and provides a zoomingfeature.andP;  It runs with CGA, EGA, VGA and Hercules graphics adapters.andM;PCTex, which is version 2.9 of Tex, costs $499 with PTIView and a driver fora LaserJet or PostScript laser printer.andP;  For typesetter drivers, add $2,500for a Chelgraph IBX or $3,000 for an Autologic APS-5.andP;  PTIView alone sellsfor $319.andM;Personal Tex said the next version of Tex, called 3.0, is expected soon.andP;  Itwill differ mainly in providing additional support for foreign languagehyphenation and expanded character sets.andM;Personal Tex also introduced these products:andM;* A driver for the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet and DeskJet Plus printers.andP;  Thedriver alone costs $119; with a DeskJet printer, it is $995.andM;* A macro package called PicTex, which allows for direct formatting of graphsand line drawings within the Tex environment.andP;  It costs $35.andM;* A table macro facility for generating complex tables with fewer keystrokes.andO;(See illustration.)andM;Synaptic, Advent use color, TecnaviaandM;Synaptic Micro Solutions demonstrated the Advent 3B2 program, version 2.0,which supports color halftones, additional help screens and easier access tomacro functions.andP;  Handling of color is being done in conjunction with theTecnavia Picture Store and Forward (PSF) system, for which Synaptic hasobtained exclusive marketing rights in the U.S.andP;  and Canada.andM;The Tecnavia product, which wasn't shown at the Conference, handles imagesreceived from photo agencies and any other sources.andP;  Images can be viewed 15at a time or one at a time as called up from directories.andP;  The systemincludes facilities for cropping, sizing, making tonal corrections andenhancing color images, either as individual separations or as full-colorimages.andP;  Recaptioning is also supported.andP;  The system outputs individualseparations as enhanced.andM;The PSF system consists of multiple input ports, multiple black-and-white or14&quot; color terminals for photo editors, and output ports to recorders or otherdevices.andP;  Up to 1,000 images can be handled concurrently.andM;We expect to have a full report on the latest Tecnavia features after theIFRA newspaper show in Amsterdam, Oct. 16-19.andM;Synaptic was demonstrating Advent for creating display ads and forpagination, but in its current implementation, it doesn't provide truedatabase facilities.andP;  Stories are sent from the editorial system to the page,where they are flowed into assigned areas.andP;  The long-run plan, which won't bedemonstrated until well into next year, involves using the DesqViewenvironment for storing all ad and page elements.andP;  A program for preparing addummies is being written as part of the pagination process.andP;  As we understandit, an algorithm similar to the one for assigning ad space will be developedfor making a &quot;best guess&quot; at placing news stories.andP;  For example, it couldattempt to put all stories with the same keyword on one page, placing themhierarchically depending on headline size.andM;In the classified area, Synaptic is working on a &quot;massive update&quot; of itsSunType program to serve larger papers.andP;  It will handle more zones, largernetworks, more reports, and so on.andP;  The first showing was expected to occursoon.andM;New editorial developments weren't demonstrated.andM;Synaptic also announced the addition of a driver for Chelgraph's Acetypesetters.andP;  Already supported are Compugraphic 8400/8000, Linotype Cora,PostScript and Hewlett-Packard languages.andM;Ultimate shows PostScript previewandM;Ultimate Technographics demonstrated an alpha version of a PostScript previewoption it is calling PostView.andP;  It runs with a board designed by Eicon andrunning the EiconScript PostScript interpreter with some of Ultimate's ownsoftware.andP;  Thus, the package, which will cost $2,500, can serve not only as apreview but also as a proofing system, driving a Canon engine directly.andO;PostView includes 35 Bitstream fonts (more can be supported, limited only bythe amount of extended memory in the machine), which can be assigned by theuser to represent fonts that aren't available.andP;  In addition to supportingPostScript, the system can be used with other command languages by loadingthe proper widths (Cora, Compugraphic, etc.).andM;The file must have gone through handamp;j prior to being previewed.andP;  PAges largerthan the screen (currently no large monitor is supported, but Ultimate isworking on this) can be scrolled.andP;  The preview also can be enlarged.andM;Although it is too early to judge the speed of the preview, Ultimate has madeit possible to use expanded memory to store the preview of the current pageand to begin to prepare the next page for previewing while the operator isviewing the first one.andP;  When multiple pages are stored in memory in thisfashion, it is possible to move backward and forward through the file,previewing pages from memory.andP;  (This wasn't demonstrated.)andM;The preview that Ultimate has been offering will remain available as astandard product.andP;  It dosn't use true fonts or support graphics.andM;Other developments.andP;  Also new from Ultimate are the following:andM;* Colorstrip.andP;  The Colorstrip option that was previewed at Type-X in April,which takes color assignments and prepares them for proper imposition for apress, including handling chokes and spreads, has been given some newcapabilities.andP;  It now supports a color monitor in conjunction with Ultimate'sexisting soft preview.andP;  The user specifies a palette of colors, indicatingthe percentages desired for each one, from which up to nine (plus black) canbe assigned to elements within any given job.andP;  The system then calculates therequirement for outputting four separations for printing (either spot coloror process color).andP;  Color fidelity on the screen is obviously limited by the16-color maximum supported by a VGA monitor.andM;* Poststrip.andP;  Meanwhile, Poststrip, which strips PostScript pages intoposition for making a plate, has been enhanced to support user-definableregistration or trim marks, on-screen help, and page compensation and pagescaling.andP;  The latter features enable the operator to compensate for errors inoutput positioning by the page layout program by moving a page or scaling apage individually.andM;* Ace driver features.andP;  Round corners and tints are now supported on Aceoutput devices.andM;* AutoPage.andP;  The AutoPage program now mixes portrait-and landscape-orientedpages within a document.andM;* Composition program.andP;  Some new features have been added to the compositionprogram, including assignment of most program files to subdirectories, ratherthan storing them all in the root directory; indication of the spacebandvalue being used on loose lines; user specification of the &quot;threshold value&quot;at which ligature generation will be canceled when letterspacing is in effectto avoid having ligature characters appear closer than other characters,which are letterspaced; the option of not having the cursor jump to the endof wide lines while it is being moved vertically, which had bothered us whentext extended off the screen and caused the display to jump back and forth asthe cursor moved; and the option of letting the text in an handamp;j'ed file wrapon the screen, rather than extend off the edge of the screen.andP;  Features nowadded to the PostScript program include tinting text, degraded tints,specification of screen values for tints, support for the expanded PostScriptcharacter set, rotation of elements in one-degree increments within a180-degree range, cropping and rotation of graphics as they are inserted, andthe ability to import graphics from Corel Draw.andM;Ultimate also said it would introduce its PostMask masking capability atGraph Expo.andM;Xyvision on DECstation 3100andM;We provided a full rundown on Xyvision's new product line in our secondSeptember issue (Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  2), so we'll not repeat all of theannouncements here.andP;  We did have a chance to see the system running on aDECstation 3100, but the software was still too fragile to get a clearindication of its performance on the faster workstation.andM;We did, however, look at Xyvision's implementation of hung punctuation, whichis now a standard feature of its software.andP;  The system enables the user tospecify which characters will be hung on both the left and right sides, andwhat percentage of each character will hang.andP;  With this addition, Xyvisionhas successfully hurdled one of the key differentiators of high-qualitycommercial systems, bringing it in line in this respect with Penta, Bertholdand Ultimate in the typographic features war.andM;Xyvision Design.andP;  The demonstration of blending Xyvision composition withContex color design and production tools showed great potential.andP;  The idea isto use Xyvision's Magazine Layout software to define the page geometry for aContex system.andP;  Text is composed in the Xyvision system, then transferred toa Contex system, where it is rasterized for the appropriate layout block.andO;Text could still be repositioned by the Contex operator, but changes to thelayout area would require recomposing and rerasterizing the file.andM;Xyvision said it intends to offer some means of WYSIWYG editing within theContex system, but it hasn't yet decided how.andP;  The port of Xyvision softwareto X Window and the fact that the DECstation and Silicon Graphics Irisworkstations use the same compiler may prove useful in developing the bridgebetween the two systems.andP;  But don't expect a commercial product beforemid-1990.andM;The larger question about Xyvision Design is what effect the recent companyconsolidation will have on its sales and support activities.andP;  See the storyin The Latest Word of this issue for further discussion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
