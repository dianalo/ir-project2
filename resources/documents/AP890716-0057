The leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, was quoted assaying he asked ``the Soviet charge d'affairs in Khartoum to relayour request to the Soviet leadership for modernizing the Sudanesearmy's weaponry.''   ``We also expressed our desire to return our relationship withthe Soviet Union to its pre-1970 level,'' he told the Kuwait daily,Al-Seyassah.   In that year, a pro-Moscow military officer, Maj. Hashem Atta,staged an abortive coup against then-President Gaafar Nimeiri. Theattempt caused lasting Sudanese hostility toward the Soviet Union.   ``We asked Moscow to overhaul all Soviet projects in Sudan andbuild new projects. We also have Soviet arms and military equipmentwhich need maintenance,'' el-Bashir told the newspaper's reportersin Khartoum.   El-Bashir toppled Premier Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian governmentJune 30 and formed a 15-member military junta to rule the country.   The newspaper quoted el-Bashir as saying that better relationswith Moscow also would ``eventually help resolve the rebellion issuein the south.''   Rebels in southern Sudan, who are supported by Ethiopia'scommunist government, have been fighting since 1983 for greaterautonomy and for economic and administrative reforms.   El-Bashir was quoted as saying the new military regime hasreceived economic aid from Arab countries in the form of fuel, flourand medicines, but that it is looking for military aid as well.   ``We believe that Arab states are interested in enabling Sudan tohave strong armed forces and effective police. Therefore, we expectto receive arms from them,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
