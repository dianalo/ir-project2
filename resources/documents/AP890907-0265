Slember, vice president andgeneral manager of the company's energy systems business.   The Department of Energy late Wednesday confirmed it is awardinga team led by Westinghouse $50 million to design a plant that couldbe licensed and replicated as needed by electric utilities.   With a projected five-year construction schedule, costs of under$2 billion and simplified operation and maintenance, the new600-megawatt advanced passive plant, or AP600, could overcome thedecadelong delays, skyrocketing costs and some of the controversyinvolved in contemporary plants.   Today's nuclear power plants, most of them significantlydifferent from the others, are rated for 1,300 to 1,400 megawattsand cost around $10 billion.   ``We have nothing to lose. How many people have ordered a nuclearpower plant in the last 10 years? Nobody,'' Slember said lateWednesday.   The AP600, a light water reactor using standard uranium fuel,will be built in large segments in factories and assembled at thepermanent site, affording greater precision and higher quality.   Westinghouse, the U.S. leader in nuclear power plant design,hopes to have the AP600 ready to market in time for the next wave ofconstruction in the electric utility industry.   ``Many places have gone past the point where it's unlikely theycan meet the power demands without brownouts no matter what they doin the short run,'' Slember said, citing New York and Long Island.``Something's got to happen.''   Success with the AP600 could also stretch the U.S. lead innuclear power technology, he said.   Energy Department spokesman Dan Butler on Thursday declinedcomment on published reports that General Electric Corp. has alsobeen picked for a $50 million grant to develop a similar reactor.   Westinghouse identified the members of its team as Chicago Bridgeandamp; Iron Co., Bechtel North American Power Corp., Avondale IndustriesInc., Burns andamp; Roe Co., and MK Ferguson unit of Morrison KnudsonCorp. Together with the Electric Power Research Institute, the teamwould match the $50 million grant with cash and services, saidWestinghouse spokeswoman Mimi Limbach.   The AP600 will use sealed motor pumps, ``like the pumps used inthe Navy,'' Slember said. ``They run without maintenance for yearsand years. They're hermetically sealed so ... you don't have toworry about leaks during an accident.''   The number of valves and large pumps and the length of pipe haveall been reduced by 60 percent. There is 80 percent less controlcable, 50 percent fewer heat exchangers and 35 percent less heating,cooling and ventilation ductwork.   The portions of the powerplant that must be fortified towithstand earthquakes has been cut by 60 percent.   ``If an accident occurs, if a pipe breaks, we're not dependent ona large number of pipes and valves operating to cool the reactor,''Slember said.   A large tank above the core would allow water to flow by gravityto cool the reactor, while the steel containment vessel woulddissipate heat. Air, set in motion by temperature differences, wouldflow from the outside to pick up heat from the reactor and pass outthe top of the building.   ``Today, you have containment spray systems and fan coolers thatdepend on pumps and valves and a fair amount of electric power,''Slember said. Contemporary cooling systems require safety gradediesel engines for backup power.   Westinghouse began considering the advanced passive design in1984, while designing a major Japanese reactor ``with a lot ofimproved safety features,'' Slember said. ``What really made sensewas to go back to the basics and start with a clean piece of paper.''</TEXT></DOC>
