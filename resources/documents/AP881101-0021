RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court will referee a dispute overcongressional access to national security information, the latestconflict over checks and balances between the legislative andexecutive branches.   The justices announced Monday they will consider revivinglegislation limiting presidential authority to withhold classifiedinformation. A decision is expected by July.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had breast cancer surgery 10days ago at Georgetown University Hospital, was back on the benchas she and her fellow justices returned from a two-week recess tohear arguments and issue orders.   O'Connor, 58, has said the cancer was detected in an early stageand the prognosis is for a full recovery.   The national security case involving classified information, asticking point for years between Congress and various presidents,stems from a 1983 directive by President Reagan.   The directive requires federal officials, before they areallowed access to classified information, to sign an agreement theywill not disclose the information.   The directive also created a standard form for officials tosign, promising they never will divulge classified or``classifiable'' information without written permission from properauthorities.   Members of Congress said the president is seeking to abridgefree-speech rights of federal employees and ``punish whistleblowersfor making disclosures that embarrass their superiors.''   Opponents of the presidential directive also said the secrecyagreement federal employees must sign would bar them for life fromrevealing information to Congress which lawmakers are entitled toreceive.   Congress enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds during the1987-88 fiscal year to implement the standard forms Reagan hadauthorized. A similar provision was attached to the spending billfor the current fiscal year.   A federal judge declared the legislation unconstitutional lastMay because he said it tramples on presidential foreign-policypowers.   The American Foreign Service Association, representing membersof the nation's diplomatic corps, and senators and House membersfrom both political parties appealed to the Supreme Court toreinstate the law.   President Reagan announced last week that he was pocket-vetoinganother measure intended to give new protection to federalemployees who expose government fraud and abuse. That measure isnot tied directly to the case acted on by the court Monday.   In other action, the court:   _Heard arguments in a case involving a woman denied partnershipin a leading Washington accounting firm. The case centers on howdifficult it should be for employers to disprove charges of sexualstereotyping.   _Killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the WorldWar II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in U.S. prison camps.The action bars a suit for property losses by veterans of theinternment camps, but legislation was enacted this year thatpermits each detainee to receive $20,000.   _Agreed in a case from Virginia to decide whether states mustcontinue to provide lawyers for indigent death row inmates afterthey have lost their initial round of appeals.   _Ruled, 7-2, that police in Pennsylvania did not violate therights of a man suspected of drunken driving when they failed toread him Miranda warnings after he was stopped for questioning.   _Let stand an Illinois law that bans the possession of childpornography.   _Allowed public school officials in California to ban leafletsand school yearbook advertisements that promoted a student-run,lunch-hour Bible study group.</TEXT></DOC>
