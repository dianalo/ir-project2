Water Quality Concerns The 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (referredto as the Clean Water Act or CWA), prohibit the discharge of any pollutantto navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is authorizedby a NPDES permit. Efforts to improve water quality under the NPDES programhave traditionally focused primarily on reducing pollutants in dischargesof industrial process wastewater and municipal sewage. This program emphasishas developed for a number of reasons. At the onset of the program in 1972,many sources of industrial process wastewater and municipal sewage werenot adequately controlled, and represented pressing environmental problems.In addition, sewage outfalls and industrial process discharges were easilyidentified as responsible for poor, often drastically degraded water qualityconditions. However, as pollution control measures were initially developedfor these discharges, it became evident that more diffuse sources (occurringover a wide area) of water pollution, such as agricultural and urban runoffwere also major causes of water quality problems. Some diffuse sourcesof water pollution, such as agricultural storm water discharges and irrigationreturn flows, are statutorily exempted from the NPDES program. Controlsfor other diffuse sources have been slow to develop under the NODES program.Since enactment of the 1972 amendments to the CWA, considering the riseof economic activity and population, significant progress in cleaning upwater pollution has been made, particularly with regard to industrial processwastewater and municipal sewage. Expenditures by EPA, the States, and localgovernments to construct and upgrade sewage treatment facilities have substantiallyincreased the population serviced by higher levels of treatment. Permittingbacklogs for industrial process wastewater discharges have been reduced.Continuing improvements are expected for these discharges as the NPDESprogram continues to shift to toxic and water quality-based pollution control.Although assessments of water quality are extremely difficult to performand verify, several National assessments of water quality are available.For the purpose of these assessments, urban runoff is considered to bea diffuse source or nonpoint source pollution, although legally, most urbanrunoff is discharged through conveyances such as separate storm sewersor other conveyances which are point sources under the CWA, and are subjectto the NPDES program. The ``National Water Quality Inventory, 1986 Reportto Congress'' provides a general assessment of water quality based on biennialreports submitted by the States under Section 305(b) of the CWA. In preparingthe Section 305(b) Reports, the States were asked to indicate the fractionof the States' waters that were fully supporting, partly supporting, ornot supporting designated uses. The Report indicates that of the rivers,lakes, and estuaries that were assessed by States (approximately one-fifthof stream miles, one-third of lake acres and one-half of esturine waters),roughly 75% are supporting the uses for which they are designated. Forwaters with use impairments, States were asked to determine impacts dueto nonpoint (agricultural and urban runoff and other sources), municipalsewage, industrial (process wastewaters), combined sewer overflows, natural,and other sources, then combine impacts to arrive at estimates of the relativepercentage of State waters affected by each source. In this manner, therelative importance of the various sources of pollution causing use impairmentswas assessed and weighted national averages were calculated. Based on 37States that provided information of sources of pollution, industrial processwastewaters were cited as the cause of nonsupport for 9% for rivers andstreams, 1% lakes, and 8% for estuaries. Municipal sewage was the causeof nonsupport for 17% of rivers and streams, 8% lakes, and 22% estuaries.Nonpoint sources was the cause of nonsupport for 65% of rivers and streams,76% lakes and 45% estuaries. The Assessment concluded that pollution fromdiffuse sources such as runoff from agricultural and urban areas is citedby the States as the leading cause of water quality impairment. These sourcesappear to be increasingly important contributors of use impairment as dischargesof industrial process wastewaters and municipal sewage plants come increasinglyunder control and intensified data collection efforts provide additionalinformation.The States conducted a more comprehensive study of diffuse pollution sourcesunder the sponsorship of the Association of State and Interstate WaterPollution Control Administrators (ASIWPCA) and EPA. The study resultedin the report ``America's Clean Water_The States' Nonpoint Source Assessment,1985'' which indicated that 38 States reported urban runoff as a majorcause of beneficial use impairment. In addition, 21 States reported constructionsite runoff as a major cause of use impairment.To provide a better understanding of the nature of urban runoff from commercialand residential areas, from 1978 through 1983, EPA provided funding andguidance to the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP). The NURP programincluded 28 projects across the Nation, conducted separately at the locallevel but centrally reviewed, coordinated, and guided.One focus of the NURP program was to characterize the water quality ofdischarges from separate storm sewers which drain residential, commercial,and light industrial (industrial parks) sites. The majority of samplescollected in the study were analyzed for eight conventional pollutantsand three metals. Data collected in NURP indicated that on an annual loadingbasis, suspended solids in discharges from separate storm sewers drainingrunoff from residential, commercial and light industrial areas are aroundan order of magnitude or more greater than effluent from sewage treatmentplants receiving secondary treatment. In addition, the study indicatedthat annual loadings of chemical oxygen demand (COD) is comparable in magnitudeto effluent from sewage treatment plants receiving secondary treatment.When analyzing annual loadings associated with urban runoff, it is importantto recognize that discharges of urban runoff are highly intermittent, andthat the short-term loadings associated with individual events will behigh and may have shockloading effects on receiving water such as sag indissolved oxygen levels. NURP data also showed that fecal coliform countsin urban runoff are typically in the tens to hundreds of thousand per 100ml of runoff during warm weather conditions, although the study suggestedthat fecal coliform may not be the most appropriate indicator organismfor identifying potential health risks in storm water runoff. AlthoughNURP did not evaluate oil and grease, other studies have demonstrated thaturban runoff is an extremely important source of oil pollution to receivingwaters, with hydrocarbon levels in urban runoff typically being reportedat a range of 2 to 10 mg/1. These hydrocarbons tend to accumulate in bottomsediments where they may persist for long periods of time, and exert adverseimpacts on benthic organisms.A portion of the NURP program involved monitoring 120 priority pollutantsin storm water discharges from lands used for residential, commercial andlight industrial activities. Seventy-seven priority pollutants were detectedin samples of storm water discharges from residential, commercial and lightindustrial lands taken during the NURP study, including 14 inorganic and63 organic pollutants. Table A-1 shows the priority pollutants which weredetected in at least ten percent of the discharge samples which were sampledfor priority pollutants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Priority Pollutants Detected in at Least 10% of NURP Samples</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,9</C><T4>TABLE A</T4>-1<H1> </H1><H1>Frequency of detection (percent)</H1>Metals and Inorganics:<ITAG tagnum="3">Antimony </ITAG><D>13</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Arsenic </ITAG><D>52</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Beryllium </ITAG><D>12</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cadmium </ITAG><D>48</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chromium </ITAG><D>58</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Copper </ITAG><D>91</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Cyanides </ITAG><D>23</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Lead </ITAG><D>94</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Nickel </ITAG><D>43</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Selenium </ITAG><D>11</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Zinc </ITAG><D>94</D>Pesticides:<ITAG tagnum="3">Alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane </ITAG><D>20</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Alpha-endosulfan </ITAG><D>19</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Chlordane </ITAG><D>17</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Lindane </ITAG><D>15</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Halogenated  aliphatics:  Methane,  dichloro <D>11</D></ITAG>Phenols and cresols:<ITAG tagnum="3">Phenol </ITAG><D>14</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Phenol, pentachloro- </ITAG><D>19</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Phenol, 4-nitro </ITAG><D>10</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Phthalate esters: Phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) <D>22</D></ITAG>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons:<ITAG tagnum="3">Chrysene </ITAG><D>10</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Fluoranthene </ITAG><D>16</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Phenanthrene </ITAG><D>12</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Pyrene </ITAG><D>15</D></ITAG>The NURP data also showed a significant number of these samples exceededvarious freshwater water quality criteria.The NURP study provides insight on what can be considered background levelsof pollutants for urban runoff, as the study focused primarily on monitoringrunoff from residential, commercial and light industrial areas. However,NURP concluded that the quality of urban runoff can be adversely impactedby several sources of pollutants that were not directly evaluated in thestudy and are generally not reflected in the NURP data, including illicitconnections, construction site runoff, industrial site runoff and illegaldumping.Other studies have shown that many storm sewers contain illicit dischargesof non-storm water, and that large amounts of wastes, particularly usedoils, are improperly disposed in storm sewers. Removal of these dischargespresent opportunities for dramatic improvements in the quality of stormwater discharges. Storm water discharges from industrial facilities maycontain, in addition to illicit connections and improperly disposed wastes,toxics and conventional pollutants when material management practices allowexposure to storm water.In some municipalities, illicit connections of sanitary, commercial andindustrial discharges to storm sewer systems have had a significant impacton the water quality of receiving waters. Although the NURP study did notemphasize identifying illicit connections to storm sewers other than toassure that monitoring sites used in the study were free from sanitarysewage contamination, the study concluded that illicit connections canresult in high bacterial counts and dangers to public health. The studyalso noted that removing such discharges presented opportunities for dramaticimprovements in the quality of urban storm water discharges.Other studies have shown that illicit connections to storm sewers can cratesevere, wide-spread contamination problems. For example, the Huron RiverPollution Abatement Program inspected 660 businesses, homes and other buildingslocated in Washtenaw County, Michigan and identified 14% of the buildingsas having improper storm drain connections. Illicit discharges were detectedat a higher rate of 60% for automobile related businesses, including servicestations, automobile dealerships, car washes, body shops and light industrialfacilities. While some of the problems discovered in this study were theresult of improper plumbing or illegal connections, a majority were approvedconnections at the time they were built. Intensive construction activities may result in severe localized impactson water quality because of high unit loads of pollutants, primarily sediments.Construction sites can also generate other pollutants such as phosphorusand nitrogen from fertilizer, pesticides, petroleum products, constructionchemicals and solid wastes. These materials can be toxic to aquatic organismsand degrade water for drinking and water-contact recreation. Sediment runoffrates from construction sites are typically 10 to 20 times that of agriculturallands, with runoff rates as high as 100 times that of agricultural lands,and typically 1,000 to 2,000 times that of forest lands. Even a small amountof construction may have a significant negative impact on water qualityin localized areas. Over a short period of time, construction sites cancontribute more sediment to streams than was previously deposited overseveral decades.B. Previous Regulatory ApproachesThe appropriate means of regulating storm water point sources within theNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program has beena matter of serious concern since implementation of the NPDES program.Each attempt to devise a workable program has been the focus of substantialcontroversy, in view of the large number of storm water sources, the natureof storm water runoff and the realities of program priorities and resources.In 1973, EPA promulgated its first storm water regulations exempting frompermit requirements those conveyances carrying storm water runoff uncontaminatedby industrial or commercial activity unless the particular storm waterdischarger had been identified by the NPDES Director as a significant contributorof pollution (38 FR 13530 (May 22, 1973)). The Agency maintained that,while these sources fell within the definition of a point source, theywere nonetheless ill-suited to the traditional end-of-pipe, technology-basedcontrols that are the basis of the NPDES program for process dischargesand discharges from Publicly-Owned Treatment Works (POTWs). Because ofthe intermittent, variable and unpredictable nature of storm water discharges,EPA reasoned that the problems caused by storm water discharges were bettermanaged at the local level through nonpoint source controls such as theimposition of specific management practices to prevent the pollutants fromentering the runoff. The Agency also justified its decision by noting thatissuing individual NPDES permits for the hundreds of thousands of stormwater point sources in the United States would create an overwhelming administrativeburden and would divert resources away from control of industrial processwastewater and municipal sewage, which at the time, were more pressingand identifiable environmental problems.In the first in a series of challenges to the storm water regulations,the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) brought suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia, challenging the Agency's authorityto selectively exempt categories of point sources from permit requirements,<T3>NRDC v. Train, </T3>396 F.Supp. 1393 (D.D.C. 1975), <T3>aff'd, NRDC v. Costle, </T3>568 F.2d 1369 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The DistrictCourt held that EPA could not exempt discharges identified as point sourcesfrom regulation under the NPDES permit program. However, in acknowledgingthe administrative burden placed on the Agency by requiring individualpermits, the court recognized EPA's discretion to use certain administrativedevices, such as area permits, to help manage its workload. In addition,the court recognized some discretion on EPA's part to define what constitutesa point source.In response to the District Court's decision in <T3>NRDC v. Train, </T3>EPA issued a rule on March 18, 1976, (41 FR 11307)establishing a comprehensive permitting program for all storm water dischargesexcept for rural runoff uncontaminated by industrial or commercial activity.This rule substantially increased the number of storm water dischargessubject to the NPDES program. Permits continued to be required for conveyancescarrying contaminated storm water runoff from areas used for industrialor commercial activities, as well as storm water discharges designatedby the permit-issuing authority as significant contributors of pollution.These sources were required to submit the then-existing individual permitapplications required of industrial and commercial process wastewater dischargers.In addition, the 1976 rule brought into the permitting program separatestorm sewers which were defined as ``conveyance or system of conveyances. . . located in an urbanized area and primarily operated for the purposeof collecting and conveying storm water runoff.'' Channelized storm waterrunoff from rural areas continued to be defined as non-point sources unlessdesignated otherwise by the permitting authority. Individual permit applicationswere not required for separate storm sewers at that point in time. EPAplanned to study such discharges and issue ``general'' or area permitsto such sources as these discharges were expected to be less significantthan storm water contaminated by industrial wastes.On June 7, 1979 and May 19, 1980, EPA published comprehensive revisionsto the NPDES regulations (44 FR 32854 (June 7, 1979); 45 FR 33290 (May19, 1980)). With regard to storm water discharges, these rules essentiallyretained the March 18, 1976 broad definition of storm water dischargessubject to NPDES permit requirements, but applied new application requirementsto storm water point sources. Under these regulations the same applicationinformation required of all industrial and commercial process wastewaterdischargers would be required of all storm water point sources. This meantthat the new individual permit application requirements of the 1979/1980rules applicable to process wastewater discharges would also be requiredfor all storm water discharges. These new requirements included testingunder certain circumstances for a substantially greater number of pollutantsidentified in the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act (CWA) which stressedthe control of toxic pollutants. This regulation brought suits in several Court of Appeals and DistrictCourts by a number of major trade associations, several of their membercompanies, NRDC and Citizens for a Better Environment. The suits challengedmany aspects of the NPDES regulations, including the storm water provisions.Eventually all petitions for review were consolidated in the D.C. CircuitCourt of Appeals (<T3>NRDC v. EPA, </T3>673 F.2d 392 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). After two years of intensive settlement negotiations with representativesof most of the petitioners, the Agency and industry petitioners signeda settlement agreement on July 7, 1982, which addressed a number of issuesrelating to the NPDES program, including storm water. Under the terms ofthe agreement, EPA agreed to propose changes to the storm water regulations(47 <T3>FR </T3>52073 (November 18, 1982)). The proposal reflected the Agency'sattempt to balance the environmental concerns associated with such dischargeswith the practical limitations of individual NPDES permits and the realityof limited resources. Thus, the proposal significantly narrowed the definitionof storm water point source and reduced the application requirements. Theproposal defined storm water point sources as consisting only of conveyancesof storm water contaminated by process wastes, raw materials, toxics, hazardouspollutants or oil and grease. The proposal also reduced application requirements. Storm water dischargeswere proposed to be divided into two groups based on their potential forsignificant pollution problems. Group I sources (expected to pose moresignificant pollution problems) would continue to be required to submitApplication Forms 1 and 2C applicable to industrial and commercial processwastewater dischargers except that effluent testing data would be requiredonly for conventional pollutants. For all other pollutants, the applicantwould only have to indicate whether they believed any such pollutants werepresent or absent and explain why. Application requirements were furtherreduced for Group II. Essentially, the only information that would be requiredfor Group II sources would consist of basic information to identify thetype, number and location of Group II discharges. No effluent testing datawas proposed to be required at that time from these sources. The Agencyalso proposed to extend the deadline for submission of storm water permitapplications to six months after promulgation of a final rule. Finally, as also agreed to in the Settlement Agreement, EPA issued a letterstating that while the proposal was pending, EPA would not take enforcementaction against storm water dischargers other than those (1) covered byan existing NPDES permit; (2) subject to effluent limitations guidelinesor toxic pollutant standards; or (3) designated as a significant contributorof pollutants. This ``non-enforcement policy'' did not apply to existingenforcement actions, and did not affect the right of an approved NPDESState or citizens group to bring a suit against a storm water discharger.EPA's 1982 proposal to address the storm water issue again generated considerablereaction and comment from industrial groups and trade associations. Theyasserted that the proposal did not go far enough in restricting the definitionof storm water point sources. They maintained that most storm water dischargeswere <T3>de minimis </T3>sources of pollution and thus are not appropriatelyregulated under the NPDES program. States and environmental groups tookthe position that the CWA requires permits for storm water discharges regardlessof the level of pollutants present in such discharges. They contended thatthe proposal went too far in narrowing the scope of coverage and questionedwhether EPA had a legally sufficient or technically supportable basis forthe Group I/Group II designations in the proposal. EPA considered thesepublic comments and published final storm water regulations on September26, 1984 (49 FR 37998).The 1984 final rule recognized that there are two fundamental issues regardingthe NPDES regulation of storm water: (1) which storm water discharges arepoint sources and therefore within the NPDES program, and (2) what is thebest way to regulate these sources. On the first issue, the Agency was persuaded by commenters that the 1982proposal had gone too far in narrowing the scope of coverage. Data availableto EPA, such as the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) study, indicatedthat there are water quality problems associated with storm water runoffin some situations. Thus, the final rule retained the broad coverage ofthe 1980 rule in mandating the permitting of all storm water point sourcesthat discharge pollutants into waters of the United States. The September26, 1984 rule defined a storm water point source as a channelized conveyanceof storm water runoff that (1) is located in an urbanized area as definedby the Bureau of Census, or (2) discharges from lands of facilities usedfor industrial or commercial activities, or (3) is designated by the Director.To address the second issue of how to regulate these sources administratively,the final rule retained the two-tiered classification described in theNovember 18, 1982 proposal. Thus, the final rule set forth two categoriesof storm water point sources with different application requirements foreach. Group I storm water point sources were defined as those subject toeffluent limitations guidelines, located at an industrial plant or plantassociated area, or designated by the Director. All other storm water pointsources were classified as Group II. Group I dischargers were requiredto complete both Form 1 and Form 2C, the NPDES Application Form for industrialand commercial process wastewater discharges, including certain samplingand testing data. The application requirements for Group II were significantlyreduced from their existing requirements. Group II sources were requiredto submit only Form 1 plus a narrative description of the drainage area,receiving water, and any treatment applied to the discharge. Since GroupII sources were expected to pose less significant pollution problems generallyand therefore be a lower priority for permit issuance, additional informationcould be collected on these sources at a later date when permits were issuedto these sources.  The final rule also revoked the non-enforcement letter issued as part ofthe Settlement Agreement and a new permit application deadline of April26, 1985 was established. These storm water regulations generated considerable controversy (throughpost-promulgation comment) and, once again, suits were filed. With regardto coverage, it was claimed that the new definitions would subject thousandsof discharges to the program for the first time. In fact, the EPA's view,the coverage of storm water point sources under the NPDES program was essentiallyunchanged by the September 26 rulemaking. The 1984 rules deleted the term``contaminated'' and relied instead on geographic criteria. However, thischange in nomenclature resulted in the same coverage of discharges. In post-promulgation comments on the 1984 rule, various industries andtrade associations claimed that the April 26 application deadline wouldbe impossible for many dischargers to meet. It was argued that many dischargeswere located in areas where testing during the winter months would notbe feasible. It was also pointed out that the intermittent and unpredictablenature of storm water would result in difficult and time-consuming datagathering, and that six months was not enough time to locate, identify,sample and test thousands of storm water point sources. Many comments expressedthe view that requiring full samplying from every single Group I dischargerwas excessive in terms of providing sufficient data for general permits,the preferred means of regulating these sources. They argued that the Agencywould be overwhelmed with an unmanageble amount of data that would onlybe outdated by the time EPA and the States were able to issue permits.Commenters also objected to the expense of the testing when such data mightnot be utilized in a timely manner. The environmental groups maintained that, at a minimum, EPA's decisionsas reflected in the final rule were supported by the record and shouldnot be changed without strong justification supported by hard data. Theyexpressed concern that any change or delay would only exacerbate what theyperceived as EPA's failure to regulate these sources of pollutants. Upon consideration of these post-promulgation comments, EPA concluded thatit was essential to obtain additional data on storm water discharges toassess their significance as an enviromental problem, and to identify thebest means of control. However, even though the number of dischargers requiredto submit quantitative testing data had been reduced by the 1984 rule,tens of thousands of storm water point sources remained to be identified,tested and analyzed. Despite the improvments made in the 1984 regulation,EPA realized it was appropriate to request comment on whether the collectionof data from each individual Group I discharger was necessary and efficient.In addition, EPA realized that new deadlines would need to be established.Thus, in an attempt to balance environmental concerns with administrativeand practical feasibility, EPA published proposed changes to the stormwater regulations on March 7, 1985 at 50 FR 9362.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. March 7, 1985, Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. DiscussionSeveral changes to the application requirements for Group I sources wereproposed in the March 7, 1985 proposal. For industrial facilities, thesystem proposed in the March 7 notice would rely primarily on voluntary,written commitments from trade associations to submit quantitative datafrom selected representative Group I sources. In this way, EPA could obtaina manageable quantity of data to allow for the establishment of permittingpriorities and the development of general permits, thereby reducing thecost to applicants and the administrative burden on EPA and State resources.EPA proposed that the requirement that Group I dischargers submit Form2C (sampling and analysis data of effluent) be eliminated. In lieu thereof,Group I dischargers would submit Form 1 and the narrative already requiredof Group II, with two additions: Group I applicants would also submit anyavailable existing quantitative data for certain pollutants, and wouldidentify (no sampling required) the presence of pollutants listed in therule: oil and grease, total organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, andany pollutant listed in Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 122 that the applicantknew or had reason to believe were present in its storm water discharge.The March 7 notice proposed no changes to the Group II application requirements.As noted above, in proposing to suspend Form 2C, the Agency was relyingin part on commitments from industries and trade associations that theywould submit representative quantitative effluent testing data during 1985.In December 1984 and February 1985, EPA held meetings with representativesof several industries and trade associations who had raised concerns withthe requirements of the September 26 final rule. At those meetings, a numberof industry groups indicated a willingness to provide the Agency with representativedata on the storm water discharges of their membership.To follow up on these assurances, the Agency held a meeting on March 7,1985, in order to clarify the details of this data-gathering initiative.This meeting was attended by representatives of several dozen industrytrade associations, a few individual companies and an environmental group.At this meeting, EPA set forth criteria and minimum standards for the voluntarygroup data submissions. EPA requested that trade associations make a formalcommitment to provide representative data and submit these data to EPAby Septembr 1, 1985. The Agency envisioned that these data would supplementexisting data available to it and could provide a basis for establishingpermitting priorities and setting permit terms and conditions. EPA helda second meeting on March 22 to further refine and explain the data-gatheringprocess. Twenty-nine commitment letters were ultimately received. With regard to the application deadline, the March 7 proposal suggesteda deadline of December 31, 1985, and requested comments on the possibilityof extending the deadline still further for Group II storm water pointsources. As discussed in greater detail below, this part of the proposalwas addressed in a final rule (50 FR 35200 (August 29, 1985)). The August29 rule extended the deadline to December 31, 1987 for Group I, and June30, 1989 for Group II.The March 7 proposal also requested comments on whether, in the event theForm 2C requirement was retained, the regulations should include discretionaryauthority for the Director of the Office of Water Enforcement and Permitsto waive the quantitative data submission requirement for a class or categoryof Group I storm water point sources. B. Reaction of CommentsOn hundred and thirty-two comments on the March 7 proposal were receivedfrom industries, trade associations, States, cities, Federal agencies andenvironmental groups. All but two commenters supported EPA's proposal asa manageable and environmentally sound approach to the storm water permittingproblem. The two environmental groups commenting on the proposal objectedto it on a number of grounds. At a minimum, they favored withdrawal ofthe proposal and retention of the September 26 requirements. After evaluating the comments received on the March 7 proposal, assessingthe commitments received from trade associations, and re-examining theissues, EPA decided to reopen the comment period on the March 7 noticeto provide additional information and issues for public comment. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. August 12, 1985, Reopener Notice</ITAG>A. Group Application Option, Process and Procedures On August 12, 1985 (50 FR 32548), EPA reopened the comment period on theMarch 7 proposal and requested comments on a group application approachfor Group I applicants that essentially would codify the plan for submissionof representative data detailed in the March 7, 1985 proposal and discussedat the two public meetings held that same month with representatives oftrade associations, individual companies, and an environmental group. Although EPA had received 29 commitment letters from trade associations(and a few individual companies) that indicated a willingness to voluntarilysubmit representative storm water data from their memberships, the Agencywas concerned that such letters might not provide a sufficient basis forsuspending the Application Form 2C requirement for all Group I sources.In EPA's view, the voluntary data submissions would not necessarily justifythe elimination of testing requirements for those Group I sources thatwere either not covered by a trade association submission or chose notto participate in the voluntary data submissions. The 29 commitment lettersthat the Agency received also indicated widespread confusion about thescope of coverage for the data submissions by the trade associations. Inaddition, there was confusion about the appropriate pollutants to be sampledand analyzed and then submitted to the Agency as representative of thestorm water discharges of the members of the group. Nevertheless, the Agency still regarded the submission of representativedata as the most practical and efficient means of determining appropriatepermit terms and conditions, as well as permitting priorities, for themultitude of storm water point source discharges requiring NPDES permits.The August 12 proposal attempted to build upon the efforts expended byboth the Agency and those trade associations that cooperated under theMarch 7 voluntary approach. The major element of the August 12 proposal was that all Group I stormwater point sources would have to submit either an individual NPDES application(Form 1 and Form 2C) or participate in an approved group application. Thegroup application was an optional alternative to the submission of theusual individual NPDES application, with the normal regulatory provisionsgoverning permit application and issuance still applicable. Under the proposed group application option, representative data on stormwater discharges would be compiled by a trade association or similar representativeentity for a subcategory or category of dischargers. The group submissionwould satisfy the application requirements for any storm water dischargerfalling within the particular subcategory or category. The group application was to consist of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. Part1 would be a commitment by the trade association or representative entityto submit quantitative data from individual representative facilities withinthe subcategory or category, as well as a complete description of the group'sdata collection plans. Part 1 would also characterize the facilities coveredunder the group application and provide an identification of those individualfacilities that would do the actual pollutant sampling and analyses. EPAproposed that those individual facilities submitting quantitative datawould have to appropriately represent the subcategory or category coveredby the group application. Factors proposed to ensure representativenesswere a range of operations, sizes and geographic locations, facilitieswith and without treatment of their storm water discharges, data from facilitiesconnected to sanitary sewers and from facilities discharging storm waterdirectly to waters of the U.S. The Agency also proposed that the groupapplication contain submissions from 10 percent of the subcategory or category,with a minimum of 10 individual facilities. Any historical data on stormwater discharges from facilities within the group application were alsoto be submitted. Other discharges covered by the group application wouldnot be required to submit individual Forms 1 and 2C. EPA proposed to accept group applications based upon industrial subcategoriesas defined in 40 CFR Subchapter N. The Agency felt that the submissionof a group application covering a subcategory of dischargers would allowfor more effective analysis of any quantitative data received, as wellas provide a clearer basis for subsequently developed permit terms andconditions. Submission on the basis of subcategories was also consideredappropriate to avoid the ``blurring of categories'' due to the overlapof trade associations' memberships identified in the 29 voluntary commitmentletters. However, the Agency did not preclude the submission of data bycategories as long as the criteria for representativeness was met. Commentswere requested on the acceptance of group applications based upon subcategories.The August 12 notice also proposed that Part 1 of a group application wouldbe submitted to the Office of Water Enforcement and Permits (OWEP) at EPAHeadquarters in Washington, D.C. no later than 90 days after the publicationdate of any final rule. The Agency also solicited public comments on whetherany group application should be accepted after the 90-day deadline. TheAgency stated that it preferred the 90-day deadline be mandatory, suchthat failure to submit a Part 1 within that time would preclude the groupapplication option for those dischargers within the subcategory or category.Part 1 applications submitted to OWEP would be reviewed for acceptabilitybased on the proposed representative ceriteria and in accordance with 40CFR 122.21(e) [completeness of NPDES permit applications]. Comments weresolicited on the appropriateness of the proposed representative criteria.The Agency proposed that a notice would be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>if OWEP determined that a Part 1 applicationwas accepted for a particular subcategory or category of storm water dischargers.If a Part 1 application were unacceptable, OWEP could either deny the groupapplication or request changes to the application and then make a finaldecision on the acceptability of the group application. Even if a groupapplication were accepted, permitting authorities would retain the rightto require an individual permit application from any individual storm waterdischarger. Any storm water discharger falling within a subcategory or category forwhich a group application had been accepted would have the option of beingcovered under the group application or submitting an individual NPDES permitapplication. If the discharger chose coverage under the group application,no individual information would be required (unless that discharger wasidentified as one of the individual facilities submitting quantitativedata for the group application). The Agency proposed that in lieu of allsources covered by the group application submitting a Form 1, sources wouldsubmit a Notice of Intent (NOI) to the permitting authority if the facilitywished to be covered under the general permit for that subcategory or category.Any Group I source that did not fall within a group application (or desiringnot to be covered by the group application) would submit an individualNPDES permit application for their storm water discharges. Individual permitapplications would be submitted to the applicable permitting authority(i.e., an EPA Regional Office or an NPDES State). the deadline for submittalof individual applications would be the same as that for Part 2 of thegroup application, December 31, 1987.The August 12 proposal explained that Part 2 of the group application wouldconsist of the actual quantitative effluent data from the representativefacilities within the covered subcategory or category. Those individualfacilities selected to perform sampling and analyses under the group applicationwere to test for:andbullet; Any pollutant limited in an effluent limitations guideline forits subcategory or category;andbullet; Any pollutant listed in the individual facility's NPDES permitfor its process wastewater;andbullet; Oil and grease, TOC, COD, pH, BOD; andandbullet; Any information on the discharge required under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(iii) (A) and (B).The Agency requested public comments on the suitability of the pollutantsto be tested, and their sufficiency to determine accurately the characteristicsof storm water discharges.EPA also proposed that those individual facilities selected to providequantitative data under the group application would sample all of theirstorm water outfalls. EPA stated that since the individual facilities'data would be considered representative of the subcategory or category,it was appropriate to require information on all storm water outfalls inorder to fully characterize the facilities' discharges.Further, the August 12 proposal requested comment on the possibility ofa waiver from testing certain pollutants for group applicants. 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(i)(B)of the existing NPDES regulations provides authority to the permittingauthority to waive permit application reporting requirements for certainpollutants if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the permittingauthority that such information is unnecessary. Comment was also solicitedon what data should be furnished to support such a waiver request.Each individual facility submitting actual quantitative data under Part2 of the group application would complete an NPDES permit Application Form1 and form 2C. Both Form 1 and Form 2C would be signed by the individualfacilities in accordance with the signatory requirements contained in 40CFR 122.22.The trade association or representative entity that submitted Part 1 ofthe group application would compile the individual Form 1s and Forms 2Cs,and would attach a narrative certifying that the Part 2 submission correspondsto the submission described in Part 1. The Agency requested comments onits proposal that the Part 2 narrative would be signed by an associationofficer (or comparable individual) responsible for policy or decision makingfunctions and to whom authority to sign documents on behalf of the groupapplicants had been assigned. All Form 1s and Form 2Cs would be signedby the individual facilities in accordance with the general signatory requirementsof 40 CFR 122.22.Like Part 1 of the group application, Part 2 would be submitted to OWEPfor review and used to develop permit issuance priorities and model generalpermit terms and conditions. The group application option and process comportedwith the Agency's intent to issue general permits in most instances tocover storm water point sources.The August 12 proposal explained that the group application option, ifpromulgated as proposed, would only apply to those facilities in Statesnot approved to administer the NPDES permit program (i.e., where EPA isthe permit-issuing authority). Facilities within approved NPDES Statesmust follow existing State regulations. Approved NPDES States, of course,would be free to amend their regulations to adopt the group applicationoption for all storm water dischargers or as an alternative to individualstorm water permit applications in certain cases. The Agency requestedthat States, especially NPDES States, comment on the proposed group applicationprocess. In addition, EPA strongly recommended in the proposal that NPDESStates without general permit authority approved by EPA seek such authoritysince the ability to issue general permits provide an effective and efficientmeans of permitting certain storm water point sources and would allow Statesto make the best use of the results of the group applications.B. Classification of Publicly-Owned Separate Storm SewersThe August 12 reopener notice also requested comments on the Agency's clarificationof whether publicly-owned separate storm sewers located in urbanized areaswere classified as Group I or Group II storm water point sources. The Agencyconsidered the September 26, 1984 final regulations to be ambiguous onthis point, as evidenced by the numerous telephone inquiries received immediatelyafter publication of the final rule addressing this issue. The August 12proposal stated the Agency's view that municipal storm water sewers designedonly to convey storm water runoff (a.k.a., publicly-owned separate stormsewers) are Group I storm water point sources based on the data availableto the Agency through the National Urban Runoff Program (NURP) study. TheNURP study found that in many instances storm water discharged from publicly-ownedseparate storm sewers was indeed contaminated with conventional pollutants(e.g., suspended solids and fecal coliform) as well as heavy metals (e.g.,lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium). Because of the significance such dischargescan have for water quality, the Agency felt that it was appropriate toclassify publicly-owned separate storm sewers as Group I sources. The Agencyrequested comments on whether this clarification/classification was appropriate.C. Discharges into Publicly-Owned Separate Storm SewersUnder the September 26, 1984 final rule, dischargers into a publicly-ownedseparate storm sewer must either be covered by an individual NPDES permitor by a permit issued to the municipality or public entity operating thesystem. This provision, one of the items clarified under the terms of theNPDES Settlement Agreement (June 1982), which EPA proposed in November1982, allowed the operator of the outfall discharging directly to watersof the U.S. to decline responsibility for discharges into the system whileapplying for a permit for the outfall.The ``either/or'' nature of the September 26 rule allowed a municipalityto decline responsibility for non-municipal storm water discharges intothe publicly-owned separate storm sewer system. In this case, all non-municipaldischargers into the municipal system would be responsible for applyingfor and obtaining individual NPDES permits. This approach might conceivablymean that hundreds of thousands of individual NPDES permit applicationswould be received duplicating the information contained in the municipalstorm water permit application(s).The catch basins, pipes and outfalls that comprise a publicly-owned separatestorm sewer system may be owned by a municipality, a flood control district,or various other public service entities. Under the NPDES regulations,such systems are not considered to be a ``publicly-owned treatment works''(POTW) because they do not convey discharges to the POTW. For purposesof the NPDES regulations, separate storm sewers are non-POTW point sourcesand are subject to regulation in a manner that is analogous to privately-ownedtreatment systems. Under 40 CFR 122.44(m) [privately-owned treatment works],the Agency can require permits for any, some, or all of the contributorsto the system.In the August 12 notice, EPA solicited public comment on the appropriatenessof relying on the issuance of permits to the municipality or public entityresponsible for the separate storm sewer system, thereby relieving alldischargers of storm water into the system of the need to apply for andobtain individual NPDES permits. The permitting authority would retainthe authority to designate operators of such contributing storm water dischargesas co-permittees or to require individual permits.  EPA proposed that the municipality or other public entity responsible forthe separate storm sewer would be required to identify all those GroupI discharges into the system but would not be required to identify thoseGroup II discharges into the system. The Agency stated that this was themost feasible means of covering the hundreds of thousands of dischargesinto publicly-owned storm water collection systems. Since the public entity(e.g., a municipality) is currently required to obtain an NPDES permitfor the separate storm sewer system's individual outfalls, a ``single permit''approach would relieve the paperwork burden on both potential permitteesand permitting authorities. The Agency also felt that such an approachwas likely to be the most environmentally sound, since the ability of permittingauthorities to issue quality permits and address the cumulative impactsof storm water discharges would be enhanced.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Water Quality Act of 1987  </ITAG>At the same time that EPA was evaluating the appropriate means to regulatestorm water discharges, Congress was examining the storm water issue inthe course of the reauthorization of the Clean Water Act. Both the Senateand the House of Representatives passed bills to amend the Clean WaterAct in the summer of 1985 that contained provisions addressing the stormwater issue. The separate House and Senate bills were reconciled in ConferenceCommittee in 1986, and on February 4, 1987, Congress passed the Water QualityAct of 1987 (WQA).  The WQA contains three provisions which specifically address storm waterdischarges. The central provision governing storm water discharges is section405 which adds section 402(p) to the CWA. Section 402(p)(1) provides thatEPA or NPDES States cannot require a permit for certain storm water dischargesuntil October 1, 1992 except for storm water discharges exempted undersection 402(p)(2). Section 402(p)(2) lists five types of storm water dischargeswhich are required to obtain a permit prior to October 1, 1992:  (A) A discharge with respect to which a permit has been issued prior toFebruary 4, 1987;  (B) A discharge associated with industrial activity;  (C) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving apopulation of 250,000 or more;  (D) A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving apopulation of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000; or  (E) A discharge for which the Administrator or the State, as the case maybe, determines that the storm water discharge contributes to a violationof a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto the waters of the United States.  Section 402(p)(2) requires EPA to promulgate final regulations governingstorm water permit application requirements for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity and discharges from large municipalseparate storm sewer systems (systems serving a population of 250,000 ormore), by ``no later than two years'' after the date of enactment (i.e.,no later than February 4, 1989). The WQA also requires EPA to promulgatefinancial regulations governing storm water permit application requirementsfor discharges from medium municipal separate storm sewer systems (systemsserving a population of 100,000 or more but less than 250,000) by ``nolater than four years'' after enactment (i.e., no later than February 4,1991).  In addition, Section 402(p)(4) provides that permit applications for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity and discharges fromlarge municipal separate storm sewer systems ``shall be filed no laterthan three years'' after the date of enactment of the WQA (i.e., no laterthan February 4, 1990). Permit applications for discharges from mediummunicipal systems must be filed ``no later than five years'' after enactment(i.e., no later than February 4, 1992).  NPDES permits for all other storm water discharges cannot be required untilOctober 1, 1992, unless a permit for the discharge was issued prior tothe date of enactment of the WQA (i.e., February 4, 1987), or the dischargeis determined to be a significant contributor of pollutants to waters ofthe United States or is contributing to a violation of water quality standards. The WQA clarified and amended the requirements for permits for storm waterdischarges in the new CWA section 402(p)(3). The Act clarified that permitsfor discharges associated with industrial activity must meet all of theapplicable provisions of section 402 and section 301 including technologyand water quality based standards. However, the new Act makes significantchanges to the permit standards for discharges from municipal storm sewers.Section 402(p)(3)(B) provides that permits for such discharges:  (i) May be issued on a system- or jurisdiction-wide basis;  (ii) Shall include a requirement to effectively prohibit non-storm waterdischarges into the storm sewers; and  (iii) Shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to themaximum extent practicable, including management practices, control techniquesand system, design and engineering methods, and such other provisions asthe Director determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants. These changes, including the standard of maximium extent practicable (MEP),are discussed in more detail later in today's notice.  The EPA, in consultation with the States, is required to conduct two studieson storm water discharges that are in the class of discharges for whichEPA and NPDES States cannot require permits prior to October 1, 1992. Thefirst study will identify those storm water discharges or classes of stormwater discharges for which permits are not required prior to October 1,1992 and determine, to the maximum extent practicable, the nature and extentof pollutants in such discharges. The second study is for the purpose ofestablishing procedures and methods to control storm water discharges tothe extent necessary to mitigate impacts on water quality. Based on thetwo studies, the EPA in consultation with State and local officials, isrequired to issue regulations by no later than October 1, 1992 which designateadditional storm water discharges to be regulated to protect water qualityand establish a comprehensive program to regulate such designated sources.This program must, at a minimum, (A) establish priorities, (B) establishrequirements for State storm water management programs, and (C) establishexpeditious deadlines. The program may include performance standards, guidelines,guidance, and management practices and treatment requirements, as appropriate.Section 401 of the WQA amends section 402(l)(2) of the CWA to provide thatthe EPA shall not require a permit for discharges of storm water runofffrom mining operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processing,or treatment operations or transmission facilities if the storm water dischargeis not contaminated by contact with, or does not come into contact with,any overburden, raw material, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct,or waste product located on the site of such operations.Section 503 of the WQA amends section 502(14) of the CWA to exclude agriculturalstorm water discharges from the definition of point source.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Remand of 1984 Regulations</ITAG>On December 4, 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit vacated 40 CFR 122.26 (as promulgated on September26, 1984), and remanded the regulations to EPA for further rulemaking (<T3>NRDC</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> No. 80-1607). EPA had requested the remand because of significantchanges made by the storm water provisions of the WQA. The effect of thedecision was to invalidate the storm water discharge regulations then foundat andSection; 122.26.At the time of remand, andSection; 122.26 set forth, among other things,the definitions for ``storm water point source'', ``Group I storm waterdischarge'', and ``Group II storm water discharge'' and criteria for designatinga conveyance or system of conveyances as a storm water point source ona case-by-case basis.On February 12, 1988 (53 FR 4157), EPA published a notice which deletedandSection; 122.26 pursuant to the Court of Appeals' remand. The February12, 1988, notice also deleted the deadlines for submittal of Group I andGroup II storm water discharge permit applications set forth in andSection;122.21(c)(2). Section 122.21(c)(2) provided that permit applications mustbe submitted by December 31, 1987, for Group I storm water discharges andJune 30, 1989, for Group II storm water discharges. The section also requiredthat any discharge that is designated on a case-by-case basis pursuantto andSection; 122.26 must submit a storm water discharge permit applicationwithin 6 months of notification.Storm water discharges which have been issued an NPDES permit prior toFebruary 4, 1987, were not affected by the Court remand or the February12, 1988, rule. (See section 402(p)(2)(A) of the CWA.) Similarly, the remandand the rulemaking did not affect the authority of EPA or an NPDES Stateto require a permit for any storm water discharge (except an agriculturalstorm water discharge) designated under section 402(p)(2)(E) of the CWA.The notice clarified that such designated discharges meet the regulatorydefinition of point source found at 40 CFR 122.2 and that EPA or an NPDESState can rely on the statutory authority and require the filing of anapplication (Form 1 and Form 2C) for an NPDES permit with respect to suchdischarges, on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Codification Rule</ITAG>In the near future, EPA intends to publish a final rule which will codifynumerous provisions of the WQA into EPA regulations. The codification rulewill include several provisions dealing with storm water discharges. Thecodification rule will promulgate the language found at sections 402(p)(1) and (2) of the amended Clean Water Act at 40 CFR 122.26(a)(1). In addition,the codification rule will promulgate Section 503 of the WQA which exemptedagricultural storm water discharges from the definition of point sourceat 40 CFR 122.2. Finally, EPA intends to codify Section 401 of the WQAaddressing uncontaminated storm water discharges from mining or oil andgas operations at 40 CFR 122.26(a)(2).In the codification notice, EPA intends to codify the statutory authorityof section 402(p)(2)(E) of the CWA for the Administrator or the State,as the case may be, to designate storm water discharges for a permit ona case-by-case basis at 40 CFR 122.26(a)(1)(v). The provision authorizessuch a designation if the Administrator or the State determines that thestorm water discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality standardor is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United States.The case-by-case designation authority can be used to require a designatedstorm water discharge associated with industrial activity or a dischargefrom a municipal separate storm water system serving a population of 100,000or more to obtain a permit prior to the time frame proposed in today'snotice for the particular class of storm water discharges in question.In addition, the designation authority applies to storm water dischargesthat are not otherwise required to obtain a permit prior to October 1,1992, under section 402(p)(1), but that are contributing to a violationof a water quality standard or are a significant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States.In determining that a storm water discharge contributes to a violationof a water quality standard or is a sigificant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States for the purpose of a designation under section402(p)(2)(E), the legislative history for the provision provides that ``EPAor the State should use any available water quality or sampling data todetermine whether the latter two criteria (contributes to a violation ofa water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States) are met, and should require additonal samplingas necessary to determine whether or not these criteria are met''. ConferenceReport, <T3>Cong. Rec.</T3> S16443 (daily ed. October 16, 1986). In accordancewith this legislative history, EPA intends to require storm water dischargerswhose discharges are being considered for designation to submit permitapplications in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 122.21 to beused to aid in the determination of whether the discharge contributes toa violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributorof pollutants to waters of the United States. The agency will considera number of factors when determining whether a storm water discharge isa significant contributor of pollution to the waters of the United States.These factors include: the location of the discharge with respect to watersof the United States; the size of the discharge; the quantity and natureof the pollutants reaching waters of the United States; and any other relevantfactors. Today's notice proposes to incorporate these factors at 40 CFR122.26(a)(1)(v).Today's notice proposes to modify the permit application requirements forcertain storm water discharges, including discharges designated on a case-by-casebasis. Until these requirements are promulgated, operators of storm waterdischarges considered for designation must submit permit applications inaccordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 122.21 (Form 1 and Form 2C).The exemption from certain application requirements given to Group II stormwater discharges does not apply to facilities designated on a case-by-casebasis. The Group II classification, which was remanded by the Court ofAppeals in its December 4, 1987, order, was never intended to apply tostorm water discharges which were designated on a case-by-case basis.Until today's notice is promulgated and becomes effective, case-by-casedesignations, where appropriate, will be modeled after existing regulatoryprocedures found at 40 CFR 124.52 for NPDES permits required on a case-by-casebasis. The procedures at 124.52 require that whenever the Regional Administratordecides that an individual permit is required, the Regional Administratorshall notify the discharger in writing of the decision that the dischargerequires a permit and the reasons for the decision. In addition, an applicationform is to be sent with the notice. In implementing andSection; 402(p)(2)(E),the Regional Administrator generally will notify the discharger in writingthat the discharge is being considered for designation, and the reasonsfor the consideration. An application form will be sent with the notice.Deadlines for submitting permit applications will also be established ona case-by-case basis. Section 124.52 provides a 60 day period from thedate of notice for submitting a permit application. Although this 60 dayperiod may be appropriate for many designated storm water discharges, sitespecific factors may dictate that the Administrator or NPDES State provideadditional time for submitting a permit application. For example, due tothe complexities associated with designation of a municipal separate stormsewer system for a system- or jurisdiction-wide permit, the Administratoror NPDES State may provide the applicant with additional time to submitrelevant information or may require that information be submitted in severalphases.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Today's Notice </ITAG>Because of the long and complex history of the storm water permit applicationrulemaking and the subsequent enactment of the WQA, significant changesfrom the March 7, 1985 proposal and August 12, 1985 reopener have beenmade in today's notice. Where appropriate, EPA addresses major commentsto these earlier proposals in the presentation of today's notice. However,to avoid potential confusion between current and past proposals, EPA requeststhat comments submitted on today's notice focus on the regulatory proposalpresented in today's notice. EPA intends to promulgate final regulationsbased on a consideration of comments received on today's notice and willnot necessarily address comments received during previous proposals inthe final rule. In printing the proposed regulatory changes at the endof today's notice, where existing regulations are modified, this noticemay contain the existing regulatory language along with proposed changes.The existing regulatory language that is printed without proposed changeis printed for the purpose of clarifying associated proposed changes forcommenters. EPA does not request comment on existing regulatory languagethat is printed without proposed change. A. OverviewSection 405 of the WQA alters the regulatory approach to control pollutantsin storm water discharges by adopting a phased and tiered approach. Thenew provision phases in permit application requirements, permit issuancedeadlines and compliance with permit conditions for different categoriesof storm water discharges. The approach is tiered in that storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity must comply with sections 301 and 402of the CWA (requiring control of the discharge of pollutants that utilizethe Best Available Technology (BAT)), but permits for discharges from municipalseparate storm sewer systems must require controls to reduce the dischargeof pollutants to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) and must includea requirement to effectively prohibit non-storm water discharges into thestorm sewers. Furthermore, EPA in consultation with State and local officialsmust develop a comprehensive program to designate and regulate other stormwater discharges to protect water quality. Section 402(p)(1) of the amended CWA provides that EPA or NPDES Statesshall not require, with certain exceptions, permits for storm water dischargeprior to October 1, 1992. During this grace period, EPA has three tasks.EPA's first task is to identify storm water discharges which should bedesignated for immediate permitting because they contribute to a waterquality standard violation or are significant contributors of pollutantsto waters of the United States. Today's notice proposes to clarify theauthority of the Administrator or NPDES State to require a permit for astorm water discharge prior to October 1, 1992, applies to any storm waterdischarge which the Administrator or NPDES State determines contributesto a water quality violation or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States, unless the discharge is explicitly excludedfrom the NPEDES program (e.g., agricultural storm water discharges). The second task is to begin to implement the storm water program by establishingpermit application requirements and issuing permits for classes of stormwater discharge that were specifically identified in section 402(p)(2).These priority storm water discharges include storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity and discharges from a municipal separate stormsewer serving a population of 100,000 or more. During this time, EPA will evaluate appropriate modifications for permitapplication requirements for storm water discharges which are designatedfor immediate permitting because they contribute to a water quality violationor are significant contributors of pollutants to waters of the United States.EPA's third task under section 402(p) of the CWA is to consult with theStates and conduct studies for the purpose of identifying storm water dischargersor classes of discharges for which permits are temporarily not required;determining the nature and extent of pollutants in such discharges; andestablishing procedures and methods to control storm water discharges tothe extent necessary to mitigate impacts on water quality. EPA is thenrequired to issue regulations on or before October 1, 1992 which identifystorm water discharges for which permits will be required to protect waterquality. Identified storm water discharges are to be regulated under thecomprehensive program which, at a minimum, establishes priorities, requirementsfor State storm water management programs, and expeditious deadlines. Congress did not intend to limit the scope of the studies authorized bySection 402(p)(5) to the definition of storm water point source that wasin EPA's regulations at 40 CFR 122.26(b)(1) on the date of enactment ofthe WQA. For example, the legislative history accompanying the provisionstates that after October 1, 1992, ``<T3>all </T3>municipal separate storm sewers are subject to the requirementsof sections 301 and 402.'' (emphasis added) (Vol. 132 Cong. Rec. H10576(daily ed. October 15, 1986) Conference Report). Under the Agency's 1984regulations, municipal separate storm sewers located outside urban areaswere not storm water point sources unless designated on a case-by-casebasis. However, Congress clearly did not intend to exclude these dischargesfrom the section 402(p)(5) studies. Today's notice does not propose to revive the remanded regulatory definitionof storm water point source at this time. This action is taken to minimizethe confusion between the regulatory program for storm water that was inplace before the WQA was enacted and the new program that will be developedin accordance with the manadates of Section 405 of the WQA. In accordancewith Congressional intend, EPA will continue to define the scope of thecomprehensive program to regulate storm water discharges in rulemakingauthorized under section 402(p)(6) of the CWA after completing the CWAsection 402(p)(5) studies. Until the scope of the storm water regulatory program is more completelydefined, EPA will define which storm water discharges are required, inaccordance with section 402(p)(2), to obtain permits. EPA will rely onthe regulatory definition of ``point source'' at 40 CFR 122.2 to provideauthority for requiring permits for those storm water discharges whichare to be permitted prior to the completion of the rulemaking authorizedunder section 402(p)(6). In addition, EPA does not propose to revive the remanded regulatory definitionsof Group I and Group II storm water discharges. EPA is proposing and requestingcomments on technical amendments to existing NPDES regulations to removereferences to these terms.B. Definition of Storm WaterToday's notice proposes to clarify the definition of storm water at 122.26(b)(10)as storm water runoff, surface runoff, street wash waters related to streetcleaning or maintenance, infiltration (other than infiltration contaminatedby seepage from sanitary sewers or by other discharges) and drainage relatedto storm events or snow melt. This proposed definition is consistent withthe regulatory definition of ``storm sewer'' at 40 CFR 35.2005(b)(47) whichis used in the context of grants for construction of treatment works. Thisdefinition aids in distinguishing separate storm sewer conveyances fromsanitary sewers, combined sewers, process discharges and non-storm waternon-process discharges.In the WQA and other places, the term ``storm water'' is presented as asingle word. The Agency, in preparing this notice, has attempted to consistentlyuse the Government Printing Office's approved form where storm water appearsas two words. The Agency requests comment on the form (one-word or two)of the term perferred by the public.C. Responsibility for Storm Water Discharges Associated with IndustrialActivity into Municipal Separate Storm Sewers<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Prior Approaches</ITAG>In past rulemakings concerning permit applications and applicability forstorm water discharges, EPA has, within the framework of the CWA, attemptedto balance the need for addressing the environmental risk associated withstorm water discharges with the administrative burden associated with processingpermits and permit applications for the large number of storm water discharges.The regulatory term ``storm water point source'' was used to define whichstorm water discharges were subject to the NPDES program. However, underprevious regulatory schemes, not all storm water point sources were requiredto submit an individual permit application. Under regulations promulgatedunder the September 26, 1984 final rule, one permit could be issued coveringall storm water point sources that are discharged to a storm water conveyancesystem. Under this approach, all ``storm water point sources'' that dischargeinto a storm water conveyance system had to be covered either by an individualpermit or a permit issued to an operator of the portion of conveyance whichdischarges directly to waters of the United States. Any permit writtento cover more than one operator would have been required to identify thelimitations applicable to each discharge. This ``either/or'' approach inthe September 26, 1984 rule allowed the operator of the portion of theconveyance which discharges directly to waters of the United States todecline to assume responsibility for certain discharges into its separatestorm sewer system. In that situation, operators of individual storm waterpoint source discharges into the conveyance would have been responsibleto file permit applications for their discharges.In the August 12, 1985 (50 <T3>FR </T3>32552) reopener notice, EPA requested comments on a proposalthat would primarily hold municipalities responsible for obtaining a permitthat would cover all the storm water point sources that discharged to amunicipal storm water system. Under this approach, all operators of stormwater point source discharges into a municipal separate storm sewer wereto be relieved of the responsibility of having to obtain individual permits,unless the permitting authority designated such dischargers as a co-permitteewith the municipality or required an individual permit from the operatorof the discharge into the system. Under the August 12, 1985 proposal, themunicipality responsible for the system would be required to identify GroupI discharges into the municipal system. Sampling requirements for municipalseparate storm sewers that received discharges from non-municipal GroupI discharges were not specifically addressed in the August 12, 1985 notice,although the regulations in effect at that time required that applicationsfor discharges from storm sewer systems contain any information regardingdischarges into the system that would be required if separate applicationswere submitted for those discharges.Fifty-seven (57) commenters addressed the proposal in the August 12 noticethat would place the responsibility for applying for and obtaining an NPDESpermit for all storm water discharges into the system upon the municipalityor public service entity. Twenty-six (26) of the 57 felt that such an approachwould relieve many individual operators of discharges from having to obtainpermits, which would thereby reduce paperwork, but not reduce EPA's abilityto address pollution problems. One municipality felt that under this approach,critical pollution sources could be identified and permitted individuallyif necessary. One industry representative claimed that individual municipalitiesare in the best position to determine if individual permits are neededfor specific storm water discharges into the municipal system, while anotherindustry representative argued that industrial dischargers into a municipalsystem should not be singled out for individual permits over dischargesfrom shopping centers, parking lots, etc., which may have significant waterquality impacts.Twenty-one (21) commenters of the 47 were opposed to municipalities beingresponsible for obtaining a permit covering all discharges of storm waterinto the system. Eight (8) commenters, a county public service agency,6 municipalities, and a land development company, cited the substantialcosts involved in making a municipality responsible for all storm waterdischarges into its system, both in terms of identifying all dischargesinto the system and sampling and analytical costs. Three commenters (acounty agency, a municipality, and a State) pointed out that a municipalitymay lack the authority to regulate non-municipal storm water point sourcedischarges into its system, as well as nonpoint source runoff from manysources that drain into the municipal storm water sewer system. Two municipalitiesfelt that industrial storm water discharges should be controlled by EPA,not the municipalities, while several other municipalities stated thatthe pollution generator may not be held responsible under the proposedapproach.Several municipalities argued that it is impossible to monitor all stormwater inlets to the municipal system since municipalities, stated at leastone municipal commenter, do not maintain records identifying dischargersinto the system. Another municipality claimed that municipalities havealready implemented activities to control storm water discharges (e.g.,controls on construction site runoff, spill prevention and abatement ordinances,etc.) in order to improve water quality.Several commenters objected to the requirement that municipalities identifyall industrial storm water discharges into the municipal system since itshifts the burden of the regulatory requirements from the individual facilitydischarging to the municipal system to the municipality. They argued thatthere is no benefit to the municipalities under the proposed approach,and that the proposed approach was very complex and counterproductive.A county flood control district commented that a municipal storm watersystem does not create water pollution or change its ultimate destination.One municipality felt that any municipal group application should not requiredata on discharges into the municipal system, since that data should besimilar to data from direct discharges.An individual company felt that municipalities should not have the optionof excluding non-municipal storm water discharges into the system in thepermit covering the system, while on the other hand, two municipalitiesargued strongly that municipalities should be able to decline to assumeresponsibility for non-municipal discharges into the municipal system.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Today's Proposal Regarding Storm Water Discharges Associated withIndustrial Activity into Large and Medium Municipal Separate Storm SewerSystems</ITAG>Under the scheme of section 405 of the WQA, operators of large municipalseparate storm sewer systems (systems serving a population of 250,000 ormore) and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems (systems servinga population of 100,000 or more but less than 250,000), are required tosubmit permit applications for discharges from these systems prior to October1, 1992. However, generally, permits are not required from operators ofmany storm water discharges (such as storm water discharges from certaincommercial and residential facilities) into these large or medium municipalseparate storm sewer systems prior to October 1, 1992, unless the Administratoror NPDES State determines that the discharge contributes to a violationof a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto the waters of the United States. Thus, in enacting the WQA, Congressendorsed a regulatory scheme where municipalities responsible for obtainingNPDES permits for discharges from large and medium municipal separate stormsewer systems are clearly responsible for many storm water discharges whichdischarge into these municipal systems.In addition to receiving storm water discharges that are generally notrequired to obtain a permit prior to October 1, 1992 under section 402(p)(1),large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems receive storm waterdischarges that are also excluded from section 402(p)(1), including: stormwater discharges which have been issued a permit prior to the enactmentof the WQA (section 402(p)(2)(A)); storm water discharges associated withindustrial activity (section 402(p)(2)(B)); and storm water dischargeswhich the Administrator or NPDES State determines contributes to a violationof a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutantsto waters of the United States (section 402(p)(2)(E)).Today's notice requests comments on whether EPA should hold operators oflarge and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems primarily responsiblefor obtaining system-wide or area permits which cover storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity which discharge into the municipalsystem, or if non-municipal operators of storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity which discharge to large or medium municipal systemsshould be required to submit individual permit applications (or participatein a group application) for such discharges.After a consideration of comments on the August 12, 1985 reopener, andreevaluation of the issue in light of the WQA, EPA still favors holdingmunicipal operators of large or medium municipal storm sewer systems primarilyresponsible for applying for and obtaining an NPDES permit covering systemdischarges as well as storm water discharges to the system. Holding municipalitiesprimarily responsible for obtaining a permit to cover storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity which discharge into the municipalsystem would reduce the tremendous administrative burden associated withpreparing and processing the thousands of permit applications that wouldbe necessary if each storm water discharge associated with industrial activitythat goes into a large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systemhad to apply individually (or as part of a group application). The Agencybelieves this approach is the most practical option available and holdsthe most promise for long-term environmental improvements.The permit application requirements that EPA is proposing for large andmedium municipal separate storm sewer systems, discussed in more detaillater in today's notice, are intended to begin the development of thisapproach. EPA is proposing that municipal permit applications include thelocation of facilities which discharge storm water associated with industrialactivity to the municipal system (see andSection;VII.G.6 of the preamble).In addition, EPA is proposing that municipal applicants provide a descriptionof a proposed management program to reduce, to the maximum extent practicable,pollutants from storm water discharges associated with industrial activitywhich discharge to the municipal system (see andSection;VII.G.8.c of thepreamble). The proposed management program will identify priorities andprocedures for inspecting industrial facilities and for establishing andimplementing measures to reduce the discharge of pollutants in such discharges.The municipal application will be used by permit writers to develop managementprograms which will be incorporated as permit conditions in the permitissued for discharges from the municipal separate storm sewer system.Controls developed in management plans for municipal system permits maytake a variety of forms. Where necessary, municipal permittees can pursuelocal remedies to develop measures to reduce pollutants or halt troublesomedischarges into the large or medium municipal storm sewer system. Thisapproach is consistent with several comments to the August 12, 1985 proposal,which stated that many local entities have already implemented ordinancesor laws that regulate the discharge of pollutants, while other municipalitieshave developed a variety of techniques to control pollutants in storm water.Alternatively, where appropriate, municipal permittees may develop end-of-pipecontrols such as wet detention ponds or diverting flow to Publicly OwnedTreatment Works. Finally, municipal applicants will be provided with anopportunity to bring individual storm water discharges which cannot beadequately controlled by the municipal permittees to the attention of thepermitting authority who then could, at the Director's discretion, requirean individual permit for the storm water discharges into the public systemor require such dischargers to be co-permittees to the municipal systempermit by establishing conditions applicable to such users.Some municipal agencies with certain storm water responsibilities havecommented on previous rulemakings that they lack legal authority to regulatedischarges into their system. The Agency's initial analysis of legal authoritiessuch as ordinances and controls on construction site runoff indicate thatsuch local municipalities have adequate legal authority either to controlstorm water flows or control pollutant discharges to municipal systems,to the degree necessary to implement the programs envisioned in today'sproposal. The Agency requests comments on the legal authority of municipalpermittees, including detailed legal analysis of the legal authority ofmunicipalities which contend that they are precluded from exercising adequateauthority to implement such controls due to lack of authorization fromthe State in which the municipality is located. The Agency requests commentson the circumstances when it is not appropriate to hold a municipalityresponsible for discharges to municipal systems and under what circumstancesit is feasible to rely on treatment of storm water discharges in lieu ofcontrols which require legal authority to implement.Section 402(p)(3) of the CWA estabishes different standards for permitsfor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity and dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers. Where individual permits are requiredfor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, these permitsare required to meet all the applicable provisions of sections 402 and301 of the Clean Water Act, including technology-based and, where necessary,water-quality based requirements. Permits for discharges from municipalseparate storm sewers are required to adopt controls to reduce the dischargeof pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices,control techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and suchother provisions as the Administrator or the State determines appropriatefor the control of such pollutants. EPA anticipates that the applicationof maximum extent practicable controls developed in management programsin municipal system permits will generally result in similar levels ofcontrol on industrial discharges to the municipal separate storm sewersystem as conditions placed in individual NPDES permits for storm waterdischarges associated with industrial activity.In comparing the control mechanisms of individual permits and managementplans developed in municipal separate storm sewer permits, it is importantto note that currently, EPA has established effluent guideline limitationsfor storm water discharges for eight subcategories of industrial dischargers(Cement Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 411), Feedlots (40 CFR Part 412), FertilizerManufacturing (40 CFR Part 418), Petroleum Refining (40 CFR Part 419),Phosphate Manufacturing (40 CFR Part 422), Steam Electric (40 CFR Part423), Coal Mining (40 CFR Part 434), and Ore Mining and Dressing (40 CFRPart 440)). Most of the existing facilities in these subcategories alreadyhave individual permits for their storm water discharges. Under today'sproposal, facilities with existing NPDES permits for storm water dischargesto a municipal storm sewer will generally be required to maintain thesepermits. EPA requests comments on whether storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity from industries with promulgated effluent guidelineswhich discharge to municipal storm sewers should be required to obtainindividual permits.In order to aid municipalities in developing and implementing managementprograms, EPA is proposing that operators of storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity which discharge to a large or medium municipalseparate storm sewer system are not required to submit individual permitapplications (or participate in a group application) provided: andbullet; The operator of such a storm water discharge submits to the municipalityresponsible for the municipal separate storm sewer receiving the dischargethe name of facility; the location of the discharge; and a certificationthat the discharge has been tested for the presence of non-storm waterdischarges; andbullet; Such discharge is composed entirely of storm water; andbullet; Such discharge is in compliance with applicable conditions ofthe NPDES permit issued for the discharge from the municipal separate stormsewer which receives the storm water discharge associated with industrialactivity provided the discharger has been notified of such conditions;and andbullet; Such discharge does not contain a hazardous substance in excessof reporting quantities established at 40 CFR 117.3 or 40 CFR 302.4. The Agency specifically requests comments on requiring municipal permitteesto develop controls to reduce pollutants in storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity into municipal systems as an alternative to requiringindividual permits (or issuing general permits) for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Today's Proposal Regarding Storm Water Discharges Associated withIndustrial Activity from Federal Facilities into Large and Medium MunicipalSeparate Storm Sewer Systems </ITAG>EPA recognizes that storm water discharges associated with industrial activityfrom Federal facilities to municipal separate storm sewer systems may poseunique legal and administrative situations. In today's notice, the Agencyfavors proposing regulations which address storm water discharges fromFederal facilities to municipal systems in the same manner as privately-ownedstorm water discharges to municipal storm sewers. That is, storm waterdischarges associated with industrial activity from Federal facilitiesto municipal storm sewers are generally covered by the permit issued forthe municipal storm sewer system discharges and are not required to obtainan individual NPDES permit unless the Director of the NPDES program designatesthe discharge as a co-permittee with the municipality or requires an individualpermit. However, the Agency specifically requests comments on applyingthis approach to Federal facilities, and whether Federal facilities whichdischarge storm water associated with industrial activity into municipalsystems should be required to submit individual applications (or, whereappropriate, participate in a group application), and obtain individualpermits for such discharges. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Today's Proposal Regarding Storm Water Discharges Associated withIndustrial Activity into Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems Servinga Population of Less than 100,000 </ITAG>Sections 402(p) (1) and (2) of the CWA provides that discharges from municipalseparate storm sewer systems serving a population of less than 100,000are not required to obtain a permit prior to October 1, 1992, unless designatedon a case-by-case basis under section 402(p)(2)(E). Such discharges areto be included in the set of storm water discharges to be studied undersection 402(p)(5) of the CWA and are subject to regulation under section402(p)(6) of the Act. However, NPDES permits could be required under section402(p)(2)(B) for storm water discharges associated with industrial activitywhich discharge into these municipal systems prior to October 1, 1992.EPA requests comments on whether industrial facilities discharging stormwater to these systems should not be required to obtain a permit untilafter the completion of the studies mandated under section 402(p)(5) ofthe CWA. Evaluating these discharges under the studies mandated under section402(p)(5) would provide EPA additional flexibility to evaluate proceduresand methods to control these storm water discharges to the extent necessaryto mitigate impacts on water quality and to determine whether the municipalitiesresponsible for discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systemsserving a population of less than 100,000 or the industrial facility generatingthe discharge to the municipal system should be responsible for obtaininga NPDES permit. Alternatively, operators of storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity to municipal systems serving less than 100,000would be required to submit permit applications (or participate in groupapplications) in accordance with the deadlines established for other stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity that would be requiredto obtain a permit under today's proposal. D. Storm Water Discharge Sampling Storm water discharges are intermittent by their nature. Pollutant concentrationsin storm water discharges will be highly variable. Not only will variabilityarise between given events, but the flow rate and pollutant concentrationsof such discharges will vary with time during an event. This variabilityraises two technical problems: what is the best way to characterize thedischarge associated with a single storm event; and what is the best wayto characterize the variabilty beween discharges of different events thatmay be caused by seasonal changes, changes in material management practices,and other factors. The current regulations at 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7) require that applicantsfor storm water discharges submit quantitative data based on one grab sampletaken every hour of the discharge for the first four hours of discharge.In today's notice, EPA is proposing to modify this requirement such thatinstead of collecting and analyzing four grab samples individually, applicantsprovide data as indicators of two sets of conditions; first flush pollutantconcentrations and flow-weighted average storm event concentrations.Data describing pollutants in the first flush (i.e., a grab sample takenduring the first twenty minutes of the discharge) can often be used asa screen for illicit discharges and illegal dumping to the storm waterbecause pollutants associated with such activities may be flushed out ofthe system during the initial portion of the discharge. In addition, firstflush data is useful because much of the traditional structural technologyused to control storm water discharges, including detention and retentiondevices, may only provide controls for the first flush of the discharge,with relatively little or no treatment for the remainder of the discharge.First flush data will give an indication of the potential usefulness ofthese techniques to reduce pollutants in storm water discharges. Also,first flush discharges may be primarily responsible for pollutant shocksto the ecosystem in receiving waters.Studies such as NURP have shown that flow-weighted average concentrationsof storm water discharges are useful for estimating pollutant loads andestimating pollutant loads and for evaluating certain concentration-basedwater quality impacts. The use of flow-weighted composite samples are also consistent with comments raised by various industry representatives duringprevious Agency rulemakings that continuous monitoring of discharges fromstorm events is necessary to adequately characterize such discharges. In order to provide flexibility where it is not feasible to obtain a flowweighted composite sample, EPA is also proposing that applicants may, inlieu of submitting data based on a flow weighted composite, submit quantitivedata from individual samples taken during a representative storm event.EPA requests comment on the feasibility of the proposed modification ofsampling procedures at andSection; 122.21(g)(7) and the ability to characterizepollutants in storm water discharges with an average concentration anda first flush concentration compared to collecting and separately analyzingfour grab samples. The Agency invites commenters to submit any data thatcan be used to compare the accuracy and the cost of the proposed changesrelative to the exisiing regulations.In the proposed regulation, the entire provision at 122.21(g)(7) has beenpresented to provide ease of review. Today's notice only requests commentson those portions of andSection; 122.21(g)(7) that relate to sampling stormwater discharges.E. Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activity<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Permit Applicability</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>a. Storm Water Discharges to Municipal Storm Sewers. </T3>As discussedin more detail in andSection; VII.C of today's notice, EPA is proposing that,in general, the operator of a storm water discharge associated with industrialactivity will not be required to individually obtain a permit if theirdischarge goes to a municipal separate storm sewer serving a populationof 250,000 or more, or a population of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000,but that the operators of these municipal separate storm sewer systemsare primarily responsible for obtaining system-wide or area permits whichcover storm water discharges associated with industrial activity whichdischarge into the municipal system. In addition, EPA is proposing thatoperators of storm discharges associated with industrial activity whichdischarge to municipal separate storm sewer systems serving a populationof less than 100,000 are not required to obtain a permit prior to the completionof studies mandated under section 402(p)(5) of the CWA. In these cases,the Director may still designate such discharges for an individual permitor to be co-permittee.<T3>b. Storm Water Discharges to Non-Municipal Conveyances. </T3>Today'snotice proposes at andSection; 122.26(a)(5) to require all operators of stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity that discharge intoa privately or Federally owned storm water conveyance (a storm water conveyancethat is not a municipal separate storm sewer) to either be covered by anindividual permit or a permit issued to the operator of the portion ofthe system that directly discharges to waters of the United States. This``either/or'' approach, which is similar to the approach taken in the September26, 1984 final rule, allows a non-municipal operator of a storm water conveyanceto decline to assume responsibility for the non-municipal storm water dischargesinto the non-municipal conveyance.EPA considers this approach to be appropriate because some of the permitapplications requirements proposed in today's notice require the applicantto have access to information regarding the site where the storm wateris generated. Operators of non-municipal systems will generally be in apoorer position to gain knowledge of pollutants in storm water dischargesand to impose controls water discharges from other facilities than willmunicipal system operators. In addition, best management practices andother site-specific controls are often most appropriate for reducing pollutantsin storm water discharges and operators of non-municipal separate stormsewers may not be able to institute such controls. Also, some non-municipaloperators of storm water conveyances which receive storm water runoff fromindustrial facilities may not be industrial facilities themselves and thereforeshould generally be excluded from obtaining a permit prior to October 1,1992, unless specifically designated.EPA requests comments on the advantages and disadvantages of retainingthe ``either or'' approach for non-municipal storm sewers. Alternatively,EPA could adopt an approach where the operator of the portion of the conveyancewhich discharges directly to waters of the United States is responsiblefor obtaining a permit which covers all discharges to the non-municipalstorm sewer.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Scope of ``Associated with Industrial Activitity'' </ITAG>The September 26, 1984 final regulation divided those discharges that metthe regulatory definition of storm water point source into two groups.The term Group I storm water discharges was defined in an attempt to identifythose storm water discharges which had a higher potential to contributesignificantly to environmental impacts. Group I included those dischargesthat contained storm water from an industrial plant or plant associatedareas. Other storm water discharges (such as those from parking lots andadministrative buildings) located on lands used for industrial activitywere classifed as Group II discharges. The regulations defined the term``plant associated areas'' by listing several examples of areas that wouldbe associated with industrial activities. However, the resulting definitionled to confusion among the regulated community regarding the distinctionsbetween the Group I and Group II classifications.When enacting section 405 of the WQA, Congress did not explicitly adoptEPA's regulatory classification of Group I and Group II discharges. Rather,Congress required EPA to develop permit application requirements for stormwater ``discharges associated with industrial activity'' by no later thanFebruary 1, 1989. In light of the adoption of the term ``associated withindustrial activity'' in the WQA, and the ongoing confusion surroundingthe previous regulatory definition, EPA has eliminated the regulatory terms``Group I storm water discharge'' and ``Group II storm water discharge''pursuant to the Court remand and does not propose to revive it. In addition,EPA is proposing to define the term ``storm water discharge associatedwith industrial activity'' at andSection; 122.26(b)(13) and to clarify thescope of the term.In describing the scope of the term ``associated with industrial activity'',several members of Congress explained in the legislative history that theterm applied if a discharge was ``directly related to manufacturing, processingor raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.'' (Vol. 132 Cong.Rec. H10932, H10936 (daily ed. October 15, 1986); Vol. 133 Cong. Rec. H176(daily ed. January 8, 1987). EPA is proposing to clarify the regulatorydefinition of ``associated with industrial activity'' by adopting the languageused in the legislative history and supplementing it with a descriptionof various types of areas that are directly related to an industrial process(e.g., industrial plant yard, immediate access roads and rail lines, drainageponds, material handling sites, sites used for the application or disposalof process waters, sites used for the storage and maintenance of materialhandling equipment, and sites that are presently or have been used in thepast for residual treatment, storage or disposal). Today's proposal wouldclarify that the term applies to plant areas that are no longer used forsuch activities as well as areas that are currently being used for industrialprocesses.The same comments in the legislative history cited above were careful tostate that the term ``associated with industrial activity'' does not includestorm water ``discharges associated with parking lots and administrativeand employee buildings''. To accommodate this legislative intent, EPA isproposing that generally, segregated storm water discharges from theseareas will not be required to obtain a permit prior to October 1, 1992.However, if a storm water discharge from a parking lot at an industrialfacility is mixed with a storm water discharge associated with industrialactivity, the combined discharge is subject to permit application requirementsfor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.Storm water discharges from parking lots and administrative buildings alongwith other discharges from industrial lands that do not meet the regulatorydefinition of ``associated with industrial activity'' and that are segregatedfrom such discharges may be required to obtain a NPDES permit prior toOctober 1, 1992 under certain conditions. For example, large parking facilities,due to their impervious nature may generate large amounts of runoff whichmay contain significant amounts of oil and grease and heavy metals whichmay have adverse impacts on receiving waters. The Administrator or NPDESState has the authority under section 402(p)(2)(e) of the amended CWA torequire a permit prior to October 1, 1992 by designating storm water dischargessuch as those from parking lots that are significant contributors of pollutantsor contribute to a water quality standard violation. EPA will address stormwater discharges from lands used for industrial activity which do not meetthe regulatory definition of ``associated with industrial activity'' inthe section 402(p)(5) study to determine the appropriate manner to regulatesuch discharges.EPA requests comments on clarifying the types of facilities that involveindustrial activities and generate storm water. EPA prefers basing theclarification, in part, on the use of Standard Industrial Classification(SIC) codes, which have been suggested in comments to prior storm waterrulemakings because they are commonly used and accepted and would providedefinitions of facilities involved in industrial activity.EPA requests comments on the scope of the definition (types of facilitiesaddressed) as well as the clarity of regulation. EPA has identified thefollowing types of facilities which it requests comments on with respectto suitability for inclusion in the regulatory definition as facilitieswhich generate and discharge storm water associated with industrial activity:(i) Facilities subject to effluent limitations guidelines, new source performancestandards, or toxic pollutant effluent standards;(ii) Facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classification 20 through39 (manufacturing industry);(iii) Facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classification 10 through14 (mineral industry) including active or inactive mining operations andoil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations,or transmission facility that discharge storm water contaminated by contactwith or that has come into contact with, any overburden, raw material,intermediate products, finished products, byproducts or waste productslocated on the site of such operations;(iv) Hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities that areoperating under interim status or a permit under Subtitle C or RCRA;(v) Landfills, land application sites, and open dumps that receive industrialwastes and that are subject to regulation under Subtitle D of RCRA;(vi) Facilities involved in significant recycling of materials, includingmetal scrapyards, battery reclaimers, salvage yards, and automobile junkyards;(vii) Steam electric power generating facilities, including coal handlingsites, and onsite and offsite ancillary transformer storage areas;(viii) Transportation facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classification40 through 45, and 47 which have vehicle maintenance shops, material handlingfacilities, equipment cleaning operations and airport deicing operations.Only those facilities or portions of facilities that are either involvedin vehicle maintenance, loading, storage or unloading activities, or equipmentcleaning operations or which are subject to another subparagraph underthis paragraph are associated with industrial activity;(ix) POTW lands used for land application treatment technologies, sludgedisposal, handling or processing areas, and chemical handling and storageareas;(x) Facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classification 15 and16 (General building contractors and heavy construction contractors) includingclearing, grading and excavation activities except operations that resultin the disturbance of less than 1 acre total land area which are not partof a larger common plan of development or sale; or that are designed toserve single family residential projects, including duplexes, triplexesor quadruplexes, that result in the disturbance of less than 5 acre totalland areas which are not part of a larger common plan of development orsale.(xi) Automotive repair shops classified as Standard Industrial Classification751 or 753 including general automotive repair shops, paint shops, andbody repair shops, and miscellaneous repair shops classified as StandardIndustrial Classification 769;(xii) Gasoline service stations classified as Standard Industrial Code5541;(xiii) Lands other than POTW lands (offsite facilities) used for sludgemanagement;(xiv) Lumber and building materials retail facilities classified as StandardIndustrial Classification 5211;(xv) Landfills, land application sites, and open dumps that do not receiveindustrial wastes and that are subject to regulation under Subtitle D ofRCRA.(xvi) Facilities classified as Standard Industrial Classification 46 (pipelines,except natural gas), and 492 (gas production and distribution); and(xvii) Major electrical powerline corridors.Of the facilities listed above, EPA prefers that storm water dischargesfrom facilities listed in paragraphs (xi) through (xvii) not be classifiedas storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, but ratherbe part of the class of discharges for which storm water permits are notrequired prior to October 1, 1992, unless designated under section 402(p)(2)(E)of the CWA. EPA prefers to study under section 402(p)(5) of the CWA stormwater discharges from these and other facilities for appropriate regulationunder section 402(p)(6). In addition, storm water discharges from certainfacilities listed above that are not associated with industrial activity(such as storm water discharges from parking lots which are not used formaterial management), and which are segregated from storm water dischargeswill be studied under section 402(p)(5).EPA is requesting comments on how the regulatory definition of ``associatedwith industrial activity'' can be further clarified and on clarifying thetypes of facilities that are engaged in industrial activities. Some activitiesat certain facilities will be listed in more than one category. For example,an inorganic chemical facility with an SIC code of 28 may have an on-siteunit which is subject to Subtitle C of RCRA. Although the majority of SubtitleC facilities will be addressed by other classifications listed above, listingSubtitle C facilities separately provides additional clarification. EPArequests comments on further classifications that would serve to clarifythe proposed definition of storm water discharge associated with industrialactivity (for example, are distinct categories for treatment, storage ordisposal facilities for source, special nuclear or by-product materialas defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011et seq. or sites listed on the National Priority List (other than sitesthat are Fund-financed pursuant to CERCLA section 106 which are exemptfrom permitting (see 40 CFR 300.65(f))) necessary to clarify that theseare facilities covered by the definition?) Today's proposal is intendedto address Department of Defense and Department of Energy facilities whichare engaged in the industrial activities listed above, even though SICcodes do not apply to these facilities. EPA requests comments on whetherthe proposed regulatory language should be clarified with respect to thesefacilities.EPA also requests comment on limiting the definition of storm water dischargeassociated with industrial activity to those discharges which do not dischargeinto municipal separate storm sewers. This limitation may be useful inclarifying which discharges are required to submit permit applicationsand obtain an NPDES permit.If EPA promulgates a final regulatory definition of ``storm water dischargeassociated with industrial activity'' that does not include certain facilitiesthat are listed in today's proposal, then those facilities would be studiedunder Section 402(p)(5) of the CWA for appropriate regulation after October1, 1992 under Section 402(p)(6) of the Act. Comments which oppose inclusionof proposed facilities to the regulatory definition of ``storm water dischargeassociated with industrial activity'' should address the nature and extentof pollutants in the storm water discharge as well as the appropriate proceduresand methods to control pollutants in storm water discharges from such facilitiesto the extent necessary to mitigate impacts on water quality. For facilitieswhich EPA requests comments on in today's notice, but that the Agency doesnot include in the final definition of ``storm water discharge associatedwith industrial activity'', the information received during the rulemaking,along with other information, will constitute a portion of the Section402(p)(5) study. In such a case, the Agency, where appropriate, will considertoday's request for comments as a proposal for regulation under Section402(p)(6) and establish appropriate regulations (such as delaying the dateof permit application submittal) based on today's proposal.Today's proposed permit application requirements for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity at andSection;122.26(c)(1)(i) includespecial requirements for storm water discharges originating from miningoperations, oil or gas operations (andSection; 122.26(c)(1)(ii), and fromthe construction operations listed above (andSection; 122.26(c)(1)(iii)).These requirements are discussed in more detail in andSection; VII.E.7 andandSection; VII.E.9 of today's notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Individual Application Requirements</ITAG>Today's notice addresses whether the requirements for permit applicationsfor discharges which contain storm water associated with industrial activityshould be modified from the requirements associated with the Form 1 andForm 2C permit applications. The proposed modifications to the permit applicationrequirements would apply to both storm water discharges associated withindustrial activity that are required to submit a permit application (andSection;VII.E.1 of the preamble discusses permit applicability) and to other dischargesfrom non-municipal separate storm sewers which have been designated bythe Administrator or NPDES State as contributing to a violation of a waterquality standard or as a significant contributor of pollutants to watersof the United States. As discussed earlier in today's notice, the September 26, 1984 regulationrequired operators of Group I storm water discharges to submit the fullNPDES Form 1 and Form 2C permit applications. In response to post-regulationcomments received on that rule, EPA proposed new permit application requirements(March 7, 1985, (50 FR 9362) and August 12, 1985, (50 FR 32548)) whichwould have decreased the analytical sampling requirements of the Form 2Cand provided procedures for group applications. The passage of the WQAhas given the EPA additional time to consider the appropriate permit applicationrequirements for storm water discharges. Today's notice proposes to modify the permit application requirements foundat 122.21 by providing special requirements for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity at andSection; 122.26(c). In responseto comments on earlier rulemakings addressing storm water discharges, EPAis proposing to shift the emphasis of the permit application requirementsfor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity from theexisting requirements for collection of quantitative data (sampling data)in Form 2C towards collection of less quantitative data supplemented byadditional information needed for evaluation of the nature of the stormwaters discharges. The permit application requirements proposed for stormwaters discharges reduce the amount of quantitative data required in thepermit application and exempt discharges which contain entirely storm water(and contain no other discharge that, without the storm water component,would require a NPDES permit), from certain reporting requirements of theForm 2C. The proposed modifications also would exempt applicants for dischargeswhich contain entirely storm water from several non-quantitative informationcollection provisions currently required in the Form 2C. The proposed modificationswould rely more on descriptive information for assessing impacts of thestorm water discharge. A proposed application form, Form 2F, for storm water discharges has beenincluded with today's notice. A complete permit application for dischargescomposed entirely of storm water, will be comprised of Form 2F and Form1. Operators of discharges which are composed of both storm water and non-stormwater will submit a Form 1, an entire Form 2C (or Form 2D) and Form 2Fwhen applying. In this case, the applicant will provide quantitative datadescribing the discharge during a storm event in Form 2F and quantitativedata describing the discharge during non-storm events in Form 2C. Non-quantitativeinformation reported in the Form 2C will not have to be reported againin the Form 2F. Under today's proposal, Form 2F for storm water discharges associated withindustrial activity would not require the submittal of all the quantitativeinformation required in Form 2C, but would require that quantitative databe submitted for:andbullet; Any pollutant limited in an effluent guideline for its subcategory;andbullet; Any pollutant listed in the facility's NPDES permit for its processwastewater;andbullet; Oil and grease, TOC, TSS, COD, pH, BOD<T2>5</T2>, total phosphorus, total nitrogen; and andbullet; Any information on the discharge required under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(iii) and (iv).In order to characterize the discharge(s) sampled, the applicant wouldbe required to submit information regarding the storm event(s) that generatedthe sampled discharge, including the date(s) the sample was taken, flowmeasurements or estimates of the duration of the storm event(s) sampled,rainfall measurements or estimates from the storm event(s) which generatedthe sampled runoff, and the duration between the storm event sampled andthe end of the previous storm event. Information regarding the storm event(s)sampled is necessary to evaluate if the discharge(s) sampled was generallyrepresentative of other discharges expected to occur during storm events,and to characterize the amount and nature of runoff discharges from thesite.Today's notice proposes that the applicant test for oil and grease, COD,pH, BOD<T2>5</T2>, TSS, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Oil and grease andTSS are a common component of storm water and can have serious impactson receiving waters. Oxygen demand (COD and BOD<T2>5</T2>) will help the permitting authority evaluate the oxygen depletionpotential of the discharge. BOD<T2>5</T2> is the most commonly used indicator of oxygen demand. COD isconsidered a more inclusive indicator of oxygen demand, especially wheremetals interfere with the BOD<T2>5</T2> test. The pH will provide the permitting authority with importantinformation on the potential availability of metals to the receiving flora,fauna and sediment. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus are measures ofnutrients which can impact water quality.The proposed Form 2F requirements regarding submission of quantitativedata are intended to allow tailoring the sampling and reporting of pollutantsto site-specific parameters that potentially have an impact on the qualityof the storm water discharge. In addition to the conventional pollutantslisted above, today's notice proposes to require applicants to, when appropriate,sample other pollutants based on a consideration of site-specific factors.These pollutants account for pollutants associated with materials usedfor production and maintenance, finished products, waste products and non-processmaterials such as fertilizers and pesticides associated with the facility.Today's notice proposes that the applicant sample for any pollutant limitedin an effluent guideline applicable to the facility or limitation in thefacility's NPDES permit. These pollutants will generally be associatedwith the facility's manufacturing process or wastes. Other process andnon-process-related pollutants, will be addressed by complying with therequirements of 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7) (iii) and (iv).Section 122.21(g)(7)(iii) requires an applicant to indicate whether theapplicant knows or has reason to believe that any pollutant listed in TableIV (conventional and nonconventional pollutants) of Appendix D to 40 CFRPart 122 are discharged. If such pollutant is either directly limited orindirectly limited by the expressed terms of the permit through limitationson an indicator, the applicant must report quantitative data. For pollutantsthat are not limited in an effluent limitations guideline, the applicantmust either report quantitative data or describe the reasons the pollutantis expected to be discharged. With regard to pollutants listed in TableII (organic pollutants) or Table III (metals, cyanide and total phenol)of Appendix D, the applicant must indicate whether he knows or has reasonto believe such pollutants are discharged from each outfall and, if theyare discharged in amounts greater than 10 parts per billion (ppbs), theapplicant must report quantitative data. An applicant qualifying as a smallbusiness under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(8), (e.g., coal mines with a probable totalannual production of less than 100,000 tons per year or, for all otherapplicants, gross total annual sales averaging less than $100,000 per year(in second quarter 1980 dollars)), is not required to analyze for pollutantslisted in Table II of Appendix D (the organic toxic pollutants).Section 122.21(g)(7)(iv) requires an applicant to indicate whether it knowsor has reason to believe that any pollutant in Table V of Appendix D to40 CFR Part 122 (certain hazardous substances) is discharged. For everypollutant expected to be discharged, the applicant must briefly describethe reasons the pollutant is expected to be discharged, and report anyexisting quantitative data it has for the pollutant.When collecting data for permit applications, applicants may make use of40 CFR 122.21(g)(7), which provides that ``when an applicant has two ormore outfalls with substantially identical effluents, the Director mayallow the applicant to test only one outfall and report that the quantitativedata also apply to the substantially identical outfalls.'' Where the facilityhas availed itself of this provision, an explanation of why the untestedoutfalls are ``substantially identical'' to tested outfalls must be providedin the application. Where the amount of flow associated with the outfallswith substantially identical effluent differs, measurements or estimatesof the total flow of each of the outfalls must be provided.The outfalls are to be sampled in accordance with the requirements of 40CFR 122.21(g)(7), which are discussed in this section and section VII.Dof today's notice. EPA is proposing that the facility must sample during``representative storm events.'' EPA request comments on the followingdefinition of a representative storm event. A representative storm eventis one that is typical for the area in terms of duration and severity.The event must be greater than 0.1 inch and must be at least 96 hours frompreviously measurable (greater than 0.1 inch rainfall) storm event. Ingeneral, variance of the parameters such as the duration of the event andthe total rainfall of the event should not exceed 50 percent from the averagerainfall event in that area. EPA also requests comments on addressing snowmelt events under this definition.Today's proposal would also modify the Form 2C requirements by exemptingapplicants from the requirements at andSection; 122.21(g)(2) (line drawings),(g)(4) (intermittent flows), (g)(7) (i), (ii), and (v) (various samplingrequirements to characterize discharges) if the discharge covered by theapplication is composed entirely of storm water. Permit applications fordischarges containing storm water associated with industrial activity wouldrequire applicants to provide other non-quantitative information whichwill aid permit writers to identify which storm water discharges are associatedwith industrial activity and to characterize the nature of the discharge.Under existing permit application regulations, 40 CFR 122.21(f)(7) requiresall permit applicants to submit as part of Form 1 a topographic map extendingone mile beyond the property boundaries of the source, depicting the facilityand each intake and discharge structure; each hazardous waste treatment,storage, or disposal facility; each well where fluids from the facilityare injected underground; and those wells, springs, other surface waterbodies, and drinking water wells listed in the map area in public recordsor otherwise known to the applicant within one-quarter mile of the facilityproperty boundary. (See 47 <T3>FR</T3> 15604, April 8, 1982). However, the information provided underandSection; 122.21(f)(7) is generally not sufficient by itself for evaluatingthe nature of storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.EPA is proposing that application requirements for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity include a drainage map of the sitein addition to the topographic map required with the Form 1. A drainagemap can provide important site specific information for evaluating thenature of the storm water discharge than the existing requirements, whichrequire a larger map with only general information. The volume of a stormwater discharge and the pollutants associated with it will depend on theconfiguration and activities occurring at the industrial site. The Agencyrequests comments under what conditions, if any, it would appropriate tosubmit a site drainage map in lieu of the Form 1 topographic map.EPA is also proposing that a narrative description be submitted to accompanythe drainage map. The proposed narrative will provide a description ofon-site features, including existing structures (buildings which covermaterials and other material covers, dikes, diversion ditches, etc.) andnon-structural controls (employee training, visual inspections, preventivemaintenance, and housekeeping measures) that are used to prevent or minimizethe potential for release of toxic and hazardous pollutants; a descriptionof significant materials that are currently or in the past have been treated,stored or disposed outside; and the method of treatment, storage or disposalused. The narrative will also include a description of activities at materialsloading and unloading areas; the location, manner and frequency in whichpesticides, herbicides, soil conditioners and fertilizers are applied;a description of the soil; the impact of storm water runoff on productionareas; and a description of the areas which are predominantly responsiblefor first flush runoff.Today's notice is also proposing that permit applicants for storm waterdischarges associated with industrial activity certify that all of theoutfalls covered in the permit application have been tested for non-stormwater discharges which are not covered by a NPDES permit. Section 405 ofthe WQA added section 402(p)(3)(B)(ii) to the CWA to require that permitsfor municipal separate storm sewers effectively prohibit non-storm waterdischarges to the storm sewer system. As discussed in andSection; VII.F.7.bof today's notice, untreated non-storm water discharges to storm sewerscan crate severe, wide-spread contamination problems and removing suchdischarges presents opportunities for dramatic improvements in the qualityof such discharges. Although section 402(p)(3)(B)(ii) specifically addressesmunicipal separate storm sewers, EPA believes that illicit non-storm waterdischarges are as likely to be mixed with storm water at a facility thatdischarges directly to the waters of the United States as it is at a facilitythat discharges to a municipal storm sewer. Accordingly, EPA feels thatis appropriate to consider potential non-storm water discharges in permitapplications for storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.The certification requirement would not apply to outfalls where storm wateris intentionally mixed with process waste water streams which are alreadyidentified in and covered by a permit.EPA is proposing to provide regulatory language that would provide thatappropriate tests for non-storm water discharges include smoke tests, fluorometricdye tests and analysis of accurate schematics. EPA requests comment onwhether analysis of storm water discharges associated with industrial activityfor various parameters (such as fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus, volatileorganic carbon (VOC), residual chlorine and detergents) would be an appropriatemethod for satisfying the certification requirement. EPA requests commentson other technologies and the use of visual observations of flow duringdry weather conditions which may be appropriate for this certificationrequirement. The Agency also requests comments on when a variance fromthis provision may be appropriate.Today's proposal would also require applicants to submit known informationregarding the history of significant spills at the facility. Such informationis necessary to aid in the determination of which drainage areas are likelyto generate storm water discharges associated with industrial activity,evaluate pollutants of concern and to develop appropriate permit conditions.Significant spills at a facility would generally include releases of oilor hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities under section311 of the Clean Water Act (see 40 CFR 110.20 and 40 CFR 117.21) or section102 of CERCLA (see 40 CFR 302.4).Like the regular NPDES permit applications, individual applications aresubmitted to the State if it is approved to administer the NPDES program,otherwise to the appropriate EPA Regional Office.In the August 12, 1985 notice, EPA requested comments on the appropriatenessof allowing for a waiver from the requirement to submit quantitative dataif the applicant can demonstrate that the information is unnecessary forpermit issuance. Although overall the commenters supported such a waiver,EPA is not proposing this type of a waiver in this notice. A waiver isinappropriate since EPA is proposing to reduce the number of pollutantsthat must be sampled and analyzed from previous regulations. The proposedrequirements for quantitative data are limited to pollutants that are appropriatefor given site-specific operations, thereby making a waiver unnecessary.Although the concept of a waiver is attractive because of the perceivedpotential reduction in burdens for applicants, the Agency believes thatbecause the storm water discharge testing reequirements have already beenstreamlined, a waiver would not in practice provide significant reductionsin burden for either applicants or permitting authorities. Requirementsto provide and verify data demonstrating that a waiver is appropriate fora storm water discharge may prove to be more of a burden to the applicantand the permitting authorities. Establishing such a waiver procedure wouldbe administratively complex and time-consuming for both the Agency andthe applicants, without any justifiable benefit. Therefore, today's proposaldoes not include a waiver provision.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Group Applications </ITAG>For two major reasons, EPA continues to support the group application approach.First, group applications will reduce the burden on the regulated communityassociated with submitting permit applications by requiring the submissionof quantitative data from only selected members of the group. Second, thegroup application process will reduce the burden on the permit issuingauthority by forming an appropriate basis and providing adequate informationfor issuing general permits. Where general permits are not appropriateor cannot be issued, a group application can be used to develop model individualpermits, which can significantly reduce the burden of issuing individualpermits. Today's notice refines and clarifies the proposal for the group applicationapproach set forth in the August 12, 1985 Reopener Notice. The proposalwould establish a regulatory procedure whereby a representative entity,such as a trade association, may submit a group application to the Officeof Water Enforcement and Permits (OWEP) at EPA headquarters, in which quantitativedata from certain representative members of a group of industrial facilitiesis supplied. Information received in the group application will be usedby OWEP to develop models for individual permits or general permits. Thesemodel permits are not issued permits, but rather they will be used by EPARegions and the NPDES States to issue individual or general permits forparticipating facilities in the State. In developing such permits, theRegion or NPDES States will, where necessary, adapt the model permits totake into account the hydrological conditions and receiving water qualityin their area. <T3>a. Facilities Covered. </T3>Today's proposal differs from the August12 proposal in that the group application is submitted for only the facilitiesspecifically listed in the application, and not necessarily for an entireindustry. This is quite different from the August 12 proposal, which proposedthat the application was to be submitted for, and be representative of,the industry as a whole, and any facility fitting within the industry subcategorydid not have to submit an individual application. Based on comments tothe August 12, 1985 proposal, the Agency agrees that submitting an applicationfor an entire industry is simply unworkable. Under the August 12 proprosal,it was likely that there would have been only one application for an entireindustry, and the one submission would have had to be representative ofthe industry as a whole. Under today's proposal, a group application willonly cover facilities listed in the application, and not the industry asa whole. The facilities in the group application selected to do samplingmust be representative of the group, not of the industry. This approacheliminates the problem expressed by some trade associations that becausethey represented only a portion of the industry, they would be unable toassure representativeness. Facilities that would be sufficiently similar to members of a group application,but that are not identified in the group application must, if they arerequired to obtain a permit, submit individual NPDES permit applicationsin accordance with the deadlines that will be established in the finalrule. Storm water discharges that are sufficiently similar to those coveredin a general permit that commence discharging after an applicable generalpermit has been issued must refer to the provisions of that general permitto determine if they are eligible for coverage and the procedures establishedin the general permit for obtaining coverage. Facilities that have alreadybeen issued an individual permit for their storm water discharge wouldgenerally not be eligible for participation in a group application. <T3>b. Scope of Group Applications. </T3>In the August 12, 1985 notice,EPA proposed that the groups would be based on EPA subcategories for processwaste water (as defined by 40 CFR Subchapter N). Over half of the commentswhich addressed this issue supported the use of subcategories over categories.However, several commenters to the August 12, 1985 proposal noted thatthis was too restrictive, and would deny the group application option tothose industries not defined by one of the Agency's subcategories or tofacilities with integrated operations, where processes could fall withinseveral subcategories. EPA subcategories are functional classifications, breaking down facilitiesinto groups, for purposes of setting effluent limitations guidelines. Thus,they are tighter than the EPA categorical designations and narrow the widedifferences among processes within a broad category. The use of EPA subcategorieswill save time for both applicants and permitting authorities in determiningwhether a particular group is appropriate for a group application. EPA recognizes that the subcategory designations may not always be available.Also, there are situations where processes that are subject to differentsubcategories are combined. The Agency agrees that the group applicationoption should be flexible enough to allow groups to be created where facilitiesare integrated or overlap into other subcategories. For these reasons,today's proposal does not limit the submission to EPA subcategories alone,but rather allows groups to be formed where facilities are similar enoughto be appropriate for general permit coverage. In determining whether a group is appropriate for general permit coverage,EPA intends that the group applicant use the factors set forth in 40 CFR122.28(a)(2)(ii), the current general permit regulation, as a guide. Iffacilities all involve the same or similar types of operations, dischargethe same types of wastes, have the same effluent limitation and same orsimilar monitoring requirements, where applicable, they would probablybe appropriate for a group application. The criteria currently used fordefining group application coverage are reasonable for defining the scopeof a group application in view of the logical assumption that similar typesof industrial facilities are likely to have some similar pollutants intheir storm water runoff.<T3>C. Group Application Requirements.</T3> The group application requirementsproposed today will consist of a Part 1 and a Part 2 application whichare to be submitted on different dates. In Part 1 of the application, applicantsare to provide information to demonstrate that participants in the groupapplication are sufficiently similar to be included in one group and preliminarilyidentify representative facilities which will be responsible for collectingand submitting quantitative data on behalf of the entire group. In Part2 of the application, representative facilities approved by EPA will beresponsible for collecting and submitting quantitative data on behalf ofthe entire group.Part 1 of the group application will consist of two components, Part 1Aand Part 1B. Part 1A of the application will be used to provide an overviewof the group. The second component of Part 1, Part 1B, will provide site-specificinformation which will be used to evaluate whether individual facilitiesare appropriate for the group application and whether the representativefacilities selected in Part 1A will indeed provide representative quantitativedata.Part 1A of the Group Application. Part 1A will consist of four elements:(1) The name and location of all facilities participating in the groupapplication; (2) a narrative description summarizing the major industrialactivities of the participants in the group application and why the participantsare appropriate for a group application; (3) a list of the significantmaterials stored outside by members of the group, and a description ofthe primary materials management practices, if any; and (4) a commitmentto provide quantitative sampling data from representative facilities inPart 2 of the permit application, and a list of the facilities which willprovide quantitative information.EPA is proposing that in Part 1A of the group application, the names offacilities participating in the group application be divided into ninesubdivisions based on the facility location relative to nine precipitationzones [see attached map, Appendix E]. These nine divisions will enablethe data in the permit application to be more easily analyzed and patternsobserved on the basis of hydrology and other regional factors. The needto identify precipitation zones arises because the amount of rainfall islikely to have a significant impact on the quality of the receiving water.According to a recent EPA study (Methodology for Analysis of DetentionBasins for Control of Urban Runoff Quality; Office of Water, Nonpoint SourceBranch, Sept. 1986) the United States can be divided into nine generalprecipitation zones. These zones are characterized by differences in precipitationvolume, precipitation intensity, precipitation duration, and precipitationintervals. Industrial facilities that seek general permits via the groupapplication option may show significantly different loading rates as aresult of these regional precipitation differences. As an example, precipitationin Seattle, Washington, located in Zone 7, approaches the mean annual stormintensity of .024 inches/hour with a mean annual storm duration of 20 hoursfor that Zone. In contrast, precipitation in Atlanta, Georgia, locatedin Zone 3 approaches the mean annual storm intensity of .102 inches/hourand a mean storm duration 6.2 hours for that Zone. Atlanta, receives onthe average four times more precipitation per hour with storms lastingone-third as long. As a result of these differences, if identical facilitieswithin a group application were situated in each of these areas, theirstorm water discharges would likely exhibit different pollutant characteristics.As mentioned above, the group application must provide a list of significantmaterials stored outside by members of the group. Such a list shall include,for example, raw materials (fuels, storage piles); intermediate materials,such as solvents and detergents; finished materials such as metallic products;and waste products such as ashes, slag and sludge. EPA is proposing thatmaterials are significant, for the purpose of preparing a group application,if they are periodically used or stored in quantities that, if releasedand mixed with storm water, could result in impacts to receiving waters.As an example, materials in quantities sufficient to be stored in a 55-gallondrum generally would be regarded as significant. However, some materialsare sufficiently toxic that smaller quantities would be considered significant,such as certain pesticides and solvents. Therefore, any materials conistentlyused that are known to be highly toxic in small quantities would also beregarded as significant materials.With regard to the materials identified, the applicant is to discuss thematerials management practices employed by members of the group. For example,the applicant should identify whether such materials are commonly covered,contained, or enclosed, whether storm water runoff from materials storageareas is collected in settling ponds prior to discharge, or diverted awayfrom such areas to minimize the likelihood of contamination. Also, theapproximate percentge of facilities in the group with no practices in placeto minimize materials stored outside is to be identified.The Agency considers that the processes and materials used at a particularfacility may have a bearing on the quality of the storm water. Thus, ifthere are different processes and materials used by members of the group,the application is to contain data from facilities utilizing the differentprocesses and materials. Accordingly, if the group members are all verysimilar in their processes and materials, then such distinctions wouldnot be necessary.The fourth element of Part 1A of the group application is a commitmentto submit quantitative data from ten percent of the facilities listed.EPA is proposing that there must be a minimum of ten and a maximum of onehundred facilities within a group that submit data. There must be a sufficientnumber of facilities submitting data for any patterns and trends to bedetectable. However, it is felt that one hundred facilities would in mostcases be sufficient to characterize the nature of the runoff. If not, EPAhas the authority to request more sampling under section 308 of the CWA.Because storm water loading rates may differ significantly as a resultof regional precipitation differences, it is necessary that each precipitationzone containing representatives of a group application have some of thoserepresentatives take samples. Thus, today's proposal would require thatPart 2 of the group application contain sampling data from at least twofacilities within each precipitation zone in which two or more membersof group are located (the application need contain sampling data for onlyone facility in a precipitation zone if that facility is the only memberof the group located in that zone). Several commenters to the August 12,1985 proposal suggested, and the Agency agrees, that the amount of rainfallwill affect the degree of impact a storm water discharge may have on thereceiving stream. In addition, facilities selected to do the sampling shouldbe representative of the group as a whole in terms of those characteristicsidentifying the group which were described in the narrative, i.e., numberand range of facilities, types of processes used, and any other relevantfactors. If there is some variation in the processes used by the group(40 percent of the group of food processors are canners and 60 percentare canners and freezers, for example), the different processes are tobe represented. Also, samples are to be provided from facilities utilizingthe materials management practices identified, including those facilitieswhich use no materials management practices. The representation of thesedifferent factors, to the extent feasible, is to be roughly equivalentto their proportion in the group.Part 1B of the Group Application. Under today's proposal, Part 1B of thegroup application is intended to provide sufficient site specific informationto allow EPA to evaluate whether all members of a group are sufficientlysimilar as to be appropriate for coverage in a group application or generalpermit, and to ensure that the facilities selected to collect quantitativedata are representative of the group.Each facility in the group application would be required to submit thenon-quantitative information that is required in an individual applicationfor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity: a drainagemap, a narrative description of material management practices and controlmeasures to control the discharge of pollutants in storm water discharges,and the history of significant spills at the facility.EPA is requiring this information because the Agency is persuaded by commentson previous proposals suggesting that site-specific practices are likelyto have a significant impact on the quality of the runoff. In addition,comparing the results of different control practices will assist in selectingmanagement practices for inclusion in NPDES permits.In addition, individual members of the group application will be requiredto certify that their facility has tested all outfalls that should containentirely storm water discharges and which drain storm water associatedwith industrial activity for the presence of nonstorm water dischargeswhich are not covered with a NPDES permit. Illicit discharges are by naturesite-specific, and hence a representative analysis involving testing ofa fraction of the facilities in the group is not appropriate for a groupapplication.Submittal of Part 1 of the Group Application. Each facility in the groupcan submit the information required in Part 1B on Form 1 and Form 2F. Theentire Form 2F does not need to be completed_only that nonquantitativeinformation for individual applicants described in today's proposal isrequired. Facilities participating in a group application will not be requiredto submit quantitative data describing their storm water discharges withPart 1 of the group application.The Form 1 and Form 2F must be signed by an authorized corporate officialof the facility submitting data, in accordance with the requirements of40 CFR 122.22. This official will make the required certifications thatthe document was prepared under his supervision, and based on inquiry ofthe persons responsible for gathering the information, the informationis, to the best of their knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete.These forms should be collected prior to submission to EPA and submittedat one time along with the information required under Part 1A to the EPAOffice of Water Enforcement and Permits (OWEP) in Washington, DC. OWEPwill review the Part 1 application for completeness (40 CFR 122.21(e),completeness of NPDES permit applications) and for compliance with thepermit application requirements. Factors likely to contribute pollutantsto storm water discharges, such as specific material management practices,will be considered in approving the facilities chosen for representativesampling of the group. Then a judgment will be made as to whether the describedgroup, as a whole, is appropriate for a single group application. If asubmission is deficient, EPA will either: reject the group application,limit the facilities participating in the group application, or requestthat corrections be made to the group application prior to a final decisionon acceptability. If the application is rejected or if EPA determines thatsome facilities must be excluded from the group application, facilitiesno longer covered by the group application would be required to submitadditional information such that complete individual applications can beevaluated.Part 2 of the Group Application. Under today's proposal, groups for whichthe Part 1 permit application have been accepted will submit Part 2 ofthe group application within 18 months of the promulgation of a final rule.Part 2 of the application will consist of quantitative data from the representativefacilities in the group that were selected in Part 1 of the application.Each facility submitting representative data in Part 2 will submit quantitativesampling data on Form 2F. The individual facilities themselves, in fillingout permit applications for their facilities, certify that the data providedare true, accurate, and complete. Individual applications submitted inPart 2 of the group application will contain sampling from each outfall,except that individual applicants may avail themselves of 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)for multiple outfalls at the same site with substantially identical effluents,as discussed under the proposed requirements for individual applications.These forms are to be submitted to the entity representing the group, whichwill compile them.As with Part 1, Part 2 of the Group Application would be submitted to thePermits Division, Office of Water Enforcement and Permits, in Washington,DC. Submission of a Part 2 application which meets Part 1 commitments andthe other standard NPDES regulatory requirements satisfies the applicationrequirements for the facilities listed on Part 1. If the information isincomplete, or simply is found to be an inadequate basis for establishinggeneral permit limits, EPA has the authority under section 308 of the CleanWater Act to require that more information be submitted, which may includesampling from facilities that were part of the group application but didnot provide data with the initial submission. If the group applicationis used by a Region or NPDES State to issue a general permit, the generalpermit should specify procedures for additional coverage under the permit.If a Part 2 is unacceptable or insufficient, EPA has the option to requestadditional information or to require that the facilities that participatedin the group application submit complete individual applications (e.g.,facilities that have submitted Form 1 with the group application wouldbe required to submit Form 2F, and facilities which have submitted completeForm 1 and Form 2F information in the group application would generallynot have to submit additional information).Once the group applications are reviewed and accepted, EPA will use theinformation to establish draft permit terms and conditions for models forindividual and general permits. The information will also allow Statesand EPA regional offices to estimate the pollutant loads from storm waterdischargers associated with the group to assist in identifying groups forwhich individual permits may be more appropriate. NPDES-approved Statesand EPA regional offices will continue to be the permit-issuing authorityfor storm water discharges. The NPDES-approved States accepting the groupapplication approach and the EPA Regions may then take the model permitsand adapt them for their particular area, making adjustments for localwater quality standards and other localized characteristics, and makingdeterminations as to the need for an individual storm water permit wheregeneral permit coverage is felt to be inappropriate. Permits would be proposedby the Region or NPDES-approved State in accordance with current regulationsfor public comment before becoming final. In NPDES States without generalpermit authority, or where an individual permit is deemed appropriate,the model permit can serve as the basis for issuing individual permits.The group application is an NPDES permit application just like any other,and as such would be handled through normal permitting procedures, subjectto the regulatory provisions applicable to permit issuance. Incompleteor otherwise inadequate submissions would be handled in the same manneras any other permit application. The permitting authority would retainthe right to require submission of Form 1, Form 2C and Form 2F from anyindividual discharger it designates.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Group Application: Applicability in NPDES States</ITAG>The relationship between EPA and the States that are authorized to administerthe NPDES program (there are 39 such States, called ``approved States'')that will implement the storm water program is one of the most complicatedaspects of today's proposal. Approved States must have requirements thatare at least as stringent as the federal program; they may be more stringentif they choose. Authority to issue general permits is opptional with NPDESStates. If they choose to issue general permits they may include such authorityin their NPDES program and, upon approval of the program by EPA, may thenissue general permits. There are currently thirteen approved States thathave authority to issue general permits: Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois,Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island,Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.Because today's group application option is a relaxation of existing NPDESpermit application requirements, the State is free to adopt this option,but is not required to. If the State chooses to adopt the group applicationand it does not have general permit authority, the group application canbe used to issue individual permits, However, EPA recommends that suchStates consider obtaining general permit authority as a means to efficientlyissue permits for storm water discharges. These States should contact theOffice of Water Enforcement and Permits at EPA Headquarters (see the <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION</T2> section at the beginning of this notice),as soon as possible.If an approved State chooses not to adopt the group application, facilitiesthat discharge storm water associated with industrial activity that arelocated in that State must submit individual applications to the respectiveState permitting authority. For facilities that discharge storm water associatedwith industrial activity which are named in a group application, the Directormay require an individual facility to submit an individual applicationwhere it determines that general permit coverage would be inappropriatefor the particular facility.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Group Application: Procedural Concerns</ITAG>Comments received on the August 12, 1985 group application proposal includedcomments from an environmental group that the proposed group applicationprocess and procedures violated federal law. This commenter claimed thatEPA was abrogating its responsibility by allowing a trade association todesign a data collection plan in lieu of completing an NPDES applicationform designed by the Agency, thus violating the Federal Advisory CommitteeAct. The commenter stated that EPA would be improperly influenced by specialinterests if trade associations were able to design their own storm waterdata gathering plans. The commenter further asserted that any decisionsby EPA on the content of specific group applications would be rulemakingsand thus subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.EPA disagrees with the comment that the group application violates theFederal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). FACA governs only those groups thatare established or ``utilized'' by an agency for the purpose of obtaining``advice'' or ``recommendations''. The group application option does notsolicit or involve any ``advice'' or ``recommendations''. It simply allowssubmission of data by certain members of a group in accordance with specificregulatory criteria for determining which facilities are ``representative''of a group. As such, the group application is merely a submission in accordanceand in compliance with specific regulatory requirements and does not containdiscretionary uncircumscribed ``advice'' or ``recommendations'' as to whichfacilities are representative of a group.Thus, the determination of which facilities should submit testing datain accordance with regulatory criteria is little different from many otherregulatory requirements where an applicant must submit information in accordancewith certain criteria. For example, under 40 CFR 122.21 all outfalls mustbe tested except where two or more have ``substantially identical'' effluents.Similarly, quantitative data for certain pollutants is to be provided wherethe applicant knows or ``has reason to believe'' such pollutants are discharged.Both of these provisions allow the applicant to exercise discretion inmaking certain judgments but such action is circumscribed by regulatorystandards. EPA further has authority to require these facilities to submitindividual applications. In none of these instances are ``recommendations''or ``advice'' involved. EPA also notes that it is questionable whether,in providing for group applications, it is ``soliciting'' advice or recommendationsfrom groups of that such groups are being ``utilized'' by the Agency asa ``preferred source'' of advice. See 48 FR 19324 (April 28, 1983). Furthermore,this data collection effort may be supplemented by EPA if, after reviewof the data, EPA determines additional data is necessary for permit issuance.Other information gathering may act as a check on the group applicationsreceived.EPA also does not agree with commenters' claims that the group applicationscheme represents an impermissible delegation of the Administrator's functionin violation of the CWA regarding data gathering. The Administrator hasthe broadest discretion in determining what information is needed for permitdevelopment as well as the manner in which such information will be collected.The CWA does not require every discharger required to obtain a permit tofile an application. Nor does the CWA require that the Administrator obtaindata on which a permit is to be based through a formal application process(see 40 CFR 122.21). For years ``applications'' have not been requiredfrom dischargers covered by general permits. EPA currently obtains muchinformation beyond that provided in applications pursuant to section 308of the CWA. This is especially true with respect to general permit andeffluent limitations guidelines development. The group application optionis simply another means of data gathering. The Administrator may alwayscollect more data should he determine it necessary upon review of a groups'data submission. And, he may obtain such additional data by whatever meanspermissible under the Statue that he deems appropriate. Thus, it can hardlybe said that by this initial data gathering effort the Administrator hasdelegated his data gathering responsibilities. In addition, since groupsare required to select ``representative'' facilities, etc., in accordancewith specific regulatory requirements established by the Administratorand because EPA will scrutinize Part 1 of the group applications and eitheraccept or reject the group as appropriate for a group application, no impermissibledelegation has occurred. EPA will make an independent determination ofthe acceptability of a group application in view of the information requiredto be submitted by the group applicant, other information available toEPA (such as information on industrial subcategories obtained in developingeffluent limitations guidelines as well as individual storm water applicationsreceived as a result of today's rule) and any further information EPA mayrequest to supplement Part 1 pursuant to section 308 of the CWA. Moreover,any concerns that a general permit may be based upon biased data can bedealt with in the public permit issuance process.Finally, EPA also does not agree that the group application option violatesthe Administrative Procedures Act. Again, the group application schemeis simply a data gathering device. EPA could very well have determinedto gather data informally via specific requests pursuant to section 308of the CWA. In fact, general permit and effluent limitations guidelinedevelopment proceed along these lines. It would make little sense if thelatter informal data gathering process were somehow illegal simply becauseit is set forth in a rule that allows applicants some relief upon certainshowings. In this respect, several of EPA's existing regulations similarlyallow an applicant to be relieved from certain data submission requirementsupon appropriate demonstrations. For example, testing for certain pollutantsand or certain outfalls may be waived under certain circumstances. Mostimportantly, the operative action of concern that impacts on the publicis actual general permit issuance based upon data obtained. As previouslystated, ample opportunity for public participation is provided in the permitissuance proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Permit Applicability and Applications for Oil, Gas and Mining Operations</ITAG>Section 401 of the WQA amended section 402(1)(2) of the CWA to prohibitthe Director of the NPDES program from requiring permits for uncontaminatedstorm water discharges from oil and gas operations and from mining operations.In the near future, EPA intends to issue a notice that will codify thisprovision into 40 CFR 122.26(a)(2). Today's notice proposes to modify 40CFR 122.26(a)(2) to clarify the scope of the provision.As discussed in more detail earlier in today's notice, on March 18, 1976(41 FR 11307), EPA promulgated permit application requirements for stormwater discharges that were located in an urbanized area or that were fromlands used for industrial or commercial activities that were contaminatedby contact with materials or contaminated soils. The approach to regulatingstorm water discharges was modified on September 24, 1984 (49 <T3>FR</T3> 37998) which deleted the term ``contaminated'' and relied insteadon geographic criteria which resulted in the same coverage (e.g., dischargesmeeting the geographic criteria were expected to meet the contaminatedcriteria).Congress adopted a similar geographic criterion to generally define thescope of the first phases of the storm water program when enacting Section405 of the WQA by requiring EPA to develop permit applications for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity and for dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewer systems serving populations of 250,000or more or serving populations of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000.However, Section 401 of the WQA, amended Section 402(1)(2) of the CWA toprovide that the Director shall not require a NPDES permit for storm waterrunoff from mining or oil and gas operations if the runoff is not contaminatedby contact with, or does not come into contact with any overburden, rawmaterial, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct or waste productlocated on the site. This provision relies on both a geographic criterionand a contamination criterion to define permit applicability.The legislative history accompanying Section 402(1)(2) clarified that Congressintended that the factors considered in determining if storm water dischargesfrom oil and gas operations are contaminated are different from the factorsconsidered for storm water discharges from mining operations. Congressintended that for these discharges, if the storm water is ``not contaminatedby contact with such materials, as determined by the Administrator, permitsare also not required. With respect to oil or grease or hazardous substances,the determination of whether stormwater is `contaminated by contact with'such materials, as established by the Administrator, shall take into considerationwhether these materials are present in such stormwater runoff in excessof reportable quantities under section 311 of the Clean Water Act or Section102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and LiabilityAct of 1980, or in the case of mining operations, above natural backgroundlevels.'' (Vol. 132 Cong. Rec. H10574 (daily ed. October 15, 1986) ConferenceReport).<T3>a. Gas and Oil Operations.</T3> EPA is proposing that contaminatedstorm water from oil and gas operations includes, but is not limited to,runoff that contains a hazardous substance in excess of reporting quantities(RQs) established at 40 CFR 117.3 or 40 CFR 302.4; or contains oil in excessof the reporting quantity established at 40 CFR 110.3.In order to implement the storm water permit requirements for oil and gasoperations, the Agency is proposing to rely primarily on notification requirementsfor releases in excess of RQs established under the CWA and CERCLA to triggerthe submittal of permit applications for storm water discharges from oiland gas operations. EPA is proposing that oil and gas operations whichdo not or have not in the past discharged storm water which contains anRQ of a hazardous substance or oil are not required to submit a permitapplication for such storm water discharges unless the Director requestsa permit application on a case-by-base basis.Oil and gas operations that have been required to notify the release ofa RQ of either oil or a hazardous substance via a storm water route willbe required to submit a permit application, including quantitative samplingdata, in accordance with proposed andSection;122.26(c)(1)(iii). Oil and gasoperations which have had a release via a storm water route in excess ofan RQ will be required to obtain a NPDES permit even if the quantitativedata submitted in the application does not indicate that the storm waterdischarge sampled contained a hazardous substance or oil in excess of areportable quantity.The proposal also provides the Director authority to require, on a case-by-casebasis, operators of oil and gas operations which have certified that itsdischarge is not contaminated to submit a permit application. In addition,the Director may require an operator of an oil and gas operation to submitinformation regarding the storm water discharge under Section 308 of theCWA.Based on a consideration of pollutants in a storm water discharge froman oil or gas facility, the Director may determine that the discharge iscontaminated even though the discharge does not contain oil or a hazardoussubstance in amounts which exceeds an RQ. Also, RQs only serve as one guidein allowing the Director to determine if the discharge is contaminated.RQs have not been developed for some pollutants, such as suspended solidsand other various indicator parameters (BOD, COD, pH, etc.), which arenot classified as oil or a hazardous substance.<T3>b. Use of Reportable Quantities to Determine if a Storm Water Dischargefrom an Oil or Gas Operation Is Contaminated. </T3>Section 311(b)(5) ofthe CWA requires reporting of certain discharges of oil or a hazardoussubstance into navigable waters (see 44 FR 50766 (August 29, 1979)). Section304(b)(4) of the Act requires that quantities of oil and hazardous substancesthat require notification be determined at quantities which may be harmfulto the public health or welfare of the United States, including but notlimited to fish, shellfish, wildlife, and public or private property, shorelinesand beaches. Facilities which discharge oil or a hazardous substance inquantities equal to or in excess of an RQ, with certain exceptions, arerequired to notify the National Response Center (NRC).Section 102 of CERCLA extended the reporting requirement for releases equalto or exceeding an RQ of a hazardous substance by adding chemicals to thelist of hazardous substances, and by extending the reporting requirement(with certain exceptions) to any releases to the environment, not justthose to navigable waters. Releases of oil are not addressed by the reportingrequirements under CERCLA.Pursuant to Section 311 of the CWA, EPA determined reportable quantitiesfor discharges by correlating aquatic animal toxicity ranges with 5 reportingquantities, i.e. 1-, 10-, 100-, 1000-, and 5000-pounds per 24 hour periodlevels. Reportable quantity adjustments made under CERCLA relied on a differentmethodology. The strategy for adjusting reportable quantities begins withan evaluation of the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological propertiesof each designated hazardous substance. The intrinsic properties examined,called ``primary criteria'', are aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity (oral,dermal, and inhalation), ignitability, reactivity, and chronic toxicity.In addition, substances that were identified as potential carcinogens havebeen evaluated for their relative activity as potential carcinogens. Eachintrinsic property is ranked on a five-tier scale, associating a specificrange of values on each scale with a particular reportable quantity value.After the primary criteria reportable quantities are assigned, the hazardoussubstances are further evaluated for their susceptibility to certain extrinsicdegradation processes called secondary criteria. Secondary criteria considerwhether a substance degrades relatively rapidly to a less harmful compound,and can be used to raise the primary criteria reportable quantity one level.Also pursuant to andSection;311, EPA has developed a reportable quantityfor oil, and associated reporting requirements at 40 CFR 110. These requirements,known as the oil sheen regulation, defines the RQ for oil to be the amountof oil that violates applicable water quality standards or causes a filmor sheen upon or discoloration of the surface of the water or adjoiningshorelines or causes a sludge or emulsion to be deposited.Reportable quantities developed under the CWA and CERCLA were not developedas effluent guideline limitations which establish allowable limits forpollutant discharges to surface waters. Rather, a major purpose of thenotification requirements is to alert government officials to releasesof hazardous substances that may require rapid response to protect publichealth and welfare and the environment. Notification based on reportablequantities serves as a trigger for informing the government of a releaseso that the need for response can be evaluated and any necessary responseundertaken in a timely fashion. The reportable quantities do not themselvesrepresent any determination that releases of a particular quantity areactually harmful to public health or welfare or the environment.In relying in today's proposal on the reporting requirements associatedwith releases in excess of RQs for oil or hazardous substances to triggerthe submittal of permit applications for oil and gas operations, the Agencybelieves that the use of the reporting requirements for oil will be particularlyuseful. The Agency believes that the release of oil to a storm water dischargein amounts that cause an oil sheen is a good indicator of the potentialfor water quality impacts from storm water releases from oil and gas operations.In addition, given the extremely high number of such operations (the Agencyestimates that there are over 750,000 oil wells alone in the United States),relying on the oil sheen test to determine if storm water discharges fromsuch sites are ``contaminated'' is more appropriate than sampling. Thedetection of a sheen does not require sophisticated instrumentation sincea sheen is easily perceived by visual observation.EPA requests comments on the use of reportable quantities for determiningwhether storm water from mining operations or oil and gas operations iscontaminated. EPA is particularly concerned with the use of RQs to definecontamination for storm water discharges from oil and gas operations.<T3>c. Mining Operations.</T3> Today's notice proposes to clarify thatcontaminated storm water runoff from mining operations includes runoffwhich contains pollutants above natural background levels. When evaluatingwhether a storm water discharge from a mining operation contains contaminatesabove background levels, EPA will consider both contaminate concentrationsand flowrates to estimate total pollutant loads. Concentration values aloneare not sufficient to indicate whether a discharge contains contaminatesabove background levels. Development of land generally causes increasedrunoff volumes. Thus, even where concentrations of pollutants remain thesame as during predevelopment, an increase in runoff volumes will resultin increases in pollutant loadings.EPA is proposing that operators of mining operations will be required tosubmit permit applications for storm water discharges from active and inactivemining areas (except for areas of coal mining operations meeting the definitionof a reclamation area under 40 CFR 434.11(1)) and haul roads where stormwater comes into contact with any overburden, raw material, intermediateproducts, finished product, byproduct or waste products. EPA is proposingat andSection;122.26(b)(12)(iii) to define storm water discharges from theseareas of a mining operation as storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity. Accordingly, the permit application requirements proposed atandSection;122.26(c)(1) will apply to these dischargers. Data in the permitapplication, and if necessary, other data required by the Director underSection 308 of the CWA, will be used to determine if the discharge containscontaminants above background levels, and therefore a permit is necessary.Mining operations with storm water discharges that are known to be contaminatedmay participate in appropriate group applications which comply with proposedandSection;122.26(c)(2).<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Application Requirements for Construction Activities</ITAG>As discussed above, EPA is proposing that storm water discharges from facilitiesclassified as Standard Industrial Codes 15 and 16 (General building contractorsand heavy construction contractors) (except construction operations thatresult in the disturbance of less than one acre total land area which arenot part of a larger common plan of development or sale; or operationsthat are for single family residential projects, including duplexes, triplexes,or quadruplexes, that result in the disturbance of less than five acretotal land areas which are not part of a larger common plan of developmentor sale), be included in the regulatory definition of storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activity.The Agency believes that storm water permits are appropriate for the constructionindustry for two reasons. First, runoff generated while construction activitiesare occurring have potential for serious water quality impacts. Where constructionactivities are intensive, the localized impacts of water quality may besevere because of high unit loads of pollutants, primarily sediments. Constructionsites can also generate other pollutants such as phosphorus, nitrogen andnutrients from fertilizer, pesticides, petroleum products, constructionchemicals and solid wastes. These materials can be toxic to aquatic organismsand degrade water for drinking and water-contact recreation. Sediment runoffrates from construction sites are typically 10 to 20 times that of agriculturallands, with runoff rates as high as 100 times that of agricultural lands,and 1,000 to 2,000 times that of forest lands. Even small constructionsites may have a significant negative impact on water quality in localizedareas. Over a short period of time, construction sites can contribute moresediment to streams than was previously deposited over several decades.Techniques to control pollutants in storm water discharges from constructionare well developed and understood. A primary control technique is goodsite planning. A combination of nonstructural and structural best managementpractices are typically used on construction sites. Relatively inexpensivenonstructural vegetative controls, such as seeding and mulching, are effectivecontrol techniques. In some cases, more expensive structural controls maybe necessary, such as detention basins or diversions. The most efficientcontrols result when a comprehensive storm water management system is inplace.The second major reason for addressing storm water discharges from theconstruction industry at this time is that studies such as NURP indicatethat it is much more cost effective to develop measures to reduce pollutantsduring new development. Many of these controls, which can take the formof grading patterns as well as other controls, generally remain in placeafter the construction activities are completed.<T3>a. Permit Application Requirements.</T3> In today's notice, EPA isproposing distinct permit application requirements for these constructionactivities, at 122.26(c)(1)(ii). Under the proposal, such facilities willbe required to provide a narrative description of:andbullet; The nature of the construction activity;andbullet; The total area of the site and the area of the site that is expectedto undergo excavation during the life of the permit;andbullet; Proposed measures, including best management practices, to controlpollutants in storm water discharges during construction, including a descriptionof applicable Federal requirements and State or local erosion and sedimentcontrol requirements; andbullet; Proposed measures to control pollutants in storm water dischargesthat will occur after construction operations have been completed, includinga description of applicable State or local requirements; andbullet; An estimate of the runoff coefficient (fraction of total rainfallthat will appear as runoff) of the site and the increase in imperviousarea after the construction addressed in the permit application is completed,a description of the nature of fill material and existing data describingthe soil or the quality of the discharge; and andbullet; The name of the receiving water. EPA is proposing that permit application requirements for the covered constructionactivities will not include the submission of quantitative data. EPA believesthat the changing nature of construction activities at the site to be coveredby the permit application requirements generally would not be adequatelydescribed by quantitative data. The Agency specifically requests comments on today's proposed permit applicationrequirements for construction facilities which discharge storm water associatedwith industrial activity, on appropriate measures to reduce pollutantsin construction site runoff, and on appropriate application deadlines.The application requirements proposed in today's notice are designed toprovide flexibility in developing controls to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges from construction sites. The proposed application requirementsrecognize that many State and local governments have implemented erosionand sediment control programs. The permit application requirements requiringa description of these programs are intended to ensure consistency betweenNPDES permit requirements and other State and local controls. <T3>b. Administrative Burdens. </T3>Ideally, model individual permits andgeneral permits will be issued for storm water discharges for constructionactivities subject to NPDES requirements to minimize administrative delaysassociated with permit issuance. EPA requests comment on administrativeburdens and delays associated with issuing NPDES permits for storm waterdischarges from certain construction activities. In addressing the administrativeburdens of regulation, commenters should consider the proposed limitationon the definition of storm water discharge associated with industrial activityand the proposed regulatory scheme for storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity which discharge to municipal separate storm sewersystems. Proposed andSection; 122.26(b)(12)(x) limits the definition of ``storm waterdischarge associated with industrial activity'' by exempting from the definitionconstruction operations that result in the disturbance of less than oneacre total land area which are not part of the larger common plan of developmentor sale; or operations that are for single family residential projects,including duplexes, triplexes, or quadruplexes, that result in the disturbanceof less than five acre total land areas which are not part of a largercommon plan of development or sale. In considering the appropriate scopeof the definition of storm water discharge associated with industrial activityas it relates to construction activities, EPA recognizes that a wide varietyof factors can affect the water quality impacts associated with constructionsite runoff, including receiving waters, the size of the area disturbed,soil conditions, seasonal rainfall patterns, the slope of area disturbed,and the intensity of construction activities. EPA favors the one acre/five acre limit primarily because of administrativeconcerns. EPA recognizes that State and local sediment and erosion controlsmay address construction activities disturbing less than one acre or fiveacres for residential development. The one acre/five acre limit proposedin today's notice is not intended to supersede more stringent State orlocal sediment and erosion controls. For construction facilities that arenot included in the definition of storm water discharge associated withindustrial activity, EPA will consider the appropriate procedures and methodsto reduce pollutants in construction site runoff under the studies authorizedby section 402(p)(5) of the CWA. EPA will also consider under section 402(p)(5)appropriate procedures and methods during post-construction for maintainingstructural controls developed pursuant to NPDES permits issued for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity from constructionsites. EPA favors distinguishing between single family residential developmentand other commercial development because other commercial development ismore likely to occur in more densely developed areas. Also, other commercialdevelopment provides a more complete opportunity to develop controls thatremain in place after the construction activity is completed, as continuedmaintenance, after the permit has expired, is more feasible. EPA requests comments on the use of no limit or other limits such as 2,10 or 20 acres. In addition, limitations could be based on or modifiedby other factors. Time limitations which consider the length of the constructionactivity or the season during which the activity occurs may provide a moreworkable administrative system while still addressing the major water qualityimpacts associated with construction activities. Other factors, such assteep slopes at the site, which affect the nature of the runoff, may beappropriate for defining special cases which would be addressed in thisrulemaking. EPA also requests comments on other factors, such as the intensityof the development within the watershed, which affect the water qualityimpacts in receiving waters. Such site specific factors may be difficultto define in federal regulations. For example, a definition based on relativelyeasily interpreted criteria such as Census designated urban areas may notprovide adequate protection for rapidly developing areas which are locatedoutside the urban area. EPA requests comments on other factors which canbe used to develop a limit on storm water discharges from constructionsites which are classified as storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity. Proposed 122.26(a) would specify that storm water discharges, includingconstruction site runoff, that discharge to municipal storm sewers arenot required to obtain individual or group permits unless specificallydesignated by the Director. Under today's proposal, municipal permitteeswill be responsible for developing a proposed management plan to controlpollutants in runoff from construction sites which discharge to large andmedium municipal separate storm sewer systems (see andSection; VII.G.8.dof the preamble). The Agency believes that the majority of constructionsites do not discharge storm water directly to waters of the United States,but rather discharge to a municipal storm sewer or manage storm water on-site.For example, construction site runoff from a new subdivision which dischargesto the drainage system of an existing road or a road that is being builtby a developer for a municipality is, under this proposal, dischargingto a municipal storm sewer. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Application Requirements for New Sources and New Discharges</ITAG>Today's proposed permit application requirements provide that new sourcesand new discharges which discharge storm water include estimates of pollutantsor parameters for which other storm water discharges are required to submitdata. Under the proposal, operators of such discharges are required toprovide the quantitative data which is required for other similar existingstorm water discharges within two years after the commencement of the discharge,unless the data has already been reported under the monitoring requirementsof the NPDES permit for the discharge.F. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Municipal Separate Storm Sewers</ITAG>Today's notice proposes to define ``municipal separate storm sewer'' atandSection; 122.26(b)(8) as any conveyance or system of conveyances thatis owned or operated by a State or local government entity and is usedfor collecting and conveying storm water which is not part of a PubliclyOwned Treatment Works (POTW) as defined at 40 CFR 122.2.It is important to note that the proposed permit application requirementsfor discharges from municipal separate storm sewers do not apply to dischargesfrom combined sewers that are designed as both a sanitary sewer and a stormsewer. Discharges from combined sewer systems are not regulated under thisproposed rule.The Agency also wants to clarify that streams, wetlands and other waterbodies that are waters of the United States are not storm sewers for thepurpose of this rule. This use of the term ``storm sewer'' differs fromthe way that the term has often been used in the context of flood control,where natural streams and other water bodies are sometimes considered stormsewers. Activities such as stream channelization, and stream bed stabilization,which occur in waters of the United States would generally not be subjectto permits issued under andSection; 402 of the CWA. However, such activitiesoccurring within waters of the United States may be subject to dredge andfill permits required under section 404 of the CWA by the Corps of Engineers.Applicants should consult the regulatory definition of ``waters of theUnited States'' at 40 CFR 122.2 to distinguish between storm sewers andwaters of the United States.Some municipalities have maintained in previous comments that difficultiesmay arise with determining owners or operators of municipal storm sewersas clear title to the storm sewer may not exist. Often, where the ownershipof such conveyances is in question, the storm sewer is not maintained andhence an ``operator'' criteria is not particularly useful. EPA requestscomments on different wording for the definition of municipal separatestorm sewer to clarify responsibility under the NPDES permit system. Dolegal classifications such as storm sewers that are not private (e.g.,public, district or joint district sewers) provide a clearer definitionthan an owner or operator criteria? Does the definition need to be clarifiedby explicitly stating that municipal streets and roads with drainage systems(curb and gutter, ditches, etc.) are part of the municipal storm sewersystem, and the owners or operators of such roads are responsible for suchdischarges? To what extent should the owner or operator concept apply tomunicipal governments with land-use authority over lands which contributestorm water runoff to the municipal storm sewer system, and how shouldthis responsibility be clarified?<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effective Prohibition on Non-Storm Water Discharges</ITAG>Section 402(p)(3)(B)(ii) of the amended CWA requires that permits for dischargesfrom municipal storm sewers shall include a requirement to effectivelyprohibit non-storm water discharges into the storm sewers.EPA does not interpret the effective prohibition on non-storm water dischargesto municipal separate storm sewers to apply to discharges that are notcomposed entirely of storm water, as long as such discharge has been issueda separate NPDES permit. Rather, an ``effective prohibition'' would requireseparate NPDES permits for non-storm water discharges to municipal stormsewers. In many cases in the past, applicants for NPDES permits for processwastewaters and other non-storm water discharges have been granted approvalto discharge into municipal separate storm sewers, provided that the permitconditions for the discharge are met at the point where the discharge entersinto the separate storm sewer. Permits for such discharges must meet applicabletechnology-based and water-quality based requirements of Sections 402 and301 of the CWA. If the permit for a non-storm water discharge to a municipalseparate storm sewer contains water-quality based limitations, then suchlimitations should generally be based on meeting applicable water qualitystandards at the boundary of a State mixing zone (for States with mixingzones) located in a water of the United States. Water-quality based limitationswould also generally be established during dry weather conditions, whenthe discharge would not be mixed with storm water in the municipal separatestorm sewer (unless receiving water conditions during wet weather dictatemore stringent water-quality based limitations).The legislative history to Section 405 of the WQA supports EPA's interpretationof the non-storm water prohibition. Senator Durenberger stated that theprohibition on non-storm water discharges into municipal separate stormsewers provision applies to non-storm water discharges to municipal separatestorm sewers that are currently illegal under the Act (Vol. 133 Cong. Rec.S752 (daily ed. January 14, 1987)). By stating that the provision appliesto discharges that are currently illegal, it is clear that Senator Durenbergerintended that the effective prohibition apply to non-storm water dischargeswithout NPDES permits, which have been illegal under the CWA since 1972.The Agency believes that the effective prohibition does not apply to dischargeswith separate NPDES permits because there would be no additional treatmentor environmental benefit from constructing a new sewer line discharginginto the same receiving water. If the discharge was not directed into anew discharge line, it might be forced into a Publicly Owned TreatmentWorks (POTW). However, certain discharges, such as high volumes of non-contactcooling water, may decrease the overall treatment efficiency of the POTWwithout notable treatment benefits for the cooling water. Overall, thequality of the receiving water is not likely to be improved by installingnew discharge lines.All options will be considered when an applicant applies for a NPDES permitfor a non-storm water discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer. Insome cases, permits will be denied for discharges to storm sewers thatare causing water quality problems in receiving waters. However, not alldischarges present such problems, and in these cases EPA or State permitwriters may allow such discharges to municipal separate storm sewers withinappropriate permit limits. Today's notice proposes two permit application requirements that are designedto begin to implement the effective prohibition. The first proposed requirement,discussed in andSection; VII.G.6.a, addresses a screening analysis whichis intended to provide sufficient information to develop priorities fora program to detect and remove illicit discharges. The second provision,discussed in andSection; VII.G.7.b, requires municipal applicants to developa recommended site-specific management plan to detect and remove illicitdischarges (or ensure they are covered by an NPDES permit) and to controlimproper disposal to municipal separate storm sewer systems. Conveyances which continue to accept other ``non-storm water'' discharges(e.g., discharges without an NPDES permit) do not meet the definition ofmunicipal separate storm sewer, and are not subject to section 402(p)(3)(B)of the CWA unless the non-storm water discharges are issued separate NPDESpermits. Instead, conveyances which continue to accept non-storm waterdischarges which have not been issued separate NPDES permits are subjectto section 301 and 402 of the CWA. For example, combined sewers which conveystorm water and sanitary sewage are not separate storm sewers and mustcomply with permit application requirements at 40 CFR 122.21 as well asother regulatory criteria for combined sewers. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Site-Specific Storm Water Quality Management Programs for MunicipalSystems</ITAG>Today's notice proposes fundamental changes to EPA's approach to controlthe discharge of pollutants from municipal separate storm sewers. Priorto the enactment of the WQA, NPDES permits for such discharges were requiredto meet all applicable provisions of section 402 and section 301 of theCWA. The WQA amended this requirement by adding section 402(p)(3)(iii)to the CWA which mandates that permits for discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutantsto the maximum extent practicable (MEP), including management practices,control techniques and systems, design and engineering methods, and suchother provisions as the Director determines appropriate for the controlof such pollutants. When enacting this provision, Congress was aware of the difficulties inregulating discharges from municipal separate storm sewers solely throughtraditional end-of-pipe treatment and intended for EPA and NPDES Statesto develop permit requirements that were much broader in nature than requirementswhich are traditionally found in NPDES permits for industrial process dischargesor POTWs. As Senator Stafford explained, municipal storm sewer system ``permitswill not necessarily be like industrial discharge permits. Often, an end-of-the-pipetreatment technology is not appropriate for this type of discharge. Asan EPA official explained in a meeting of the conferees:<ITAG tagnum="21">These are not permits in the normal sense we expect them to be. Theseare actual programs. These are permits that go far beyond the normal permitswe would issue for an industry because they in effect are programs forstormwater management that we would be writing into these permits.'' (Vol.132 Cong. Rec. S16425 (daily ed. Oct. 16, 1986))</ITAG>A shift towards comprehensive storm water quality management programs toreduce the discharge of pollutants from municipal separate storm sewersystems is appropriate for a number of reasons. First, discharges frommunicipal storm sewers are highly intermittent, and are usually characterizedby very high flow rates occurring over relatively short time intervals.For this reason, municipal storm sewers are usually designed with an extremelyhigh number of outfalls within a given municipality, to reduce potentialflooding. Traditional end-of-pipe controls are limited by material managementproblems that arise with high volume, intermittent flows occurring at alarge number of outfalls. Second, the nature and extent of pollutants in discharges from municipalsystems will depend on the activities occurring on the lands which contributerunoff to the system. Municipal separate storm sewers tend to dischargerunoff drained from lands used for a wide variety of activities. Giventhe material management problems associated with end-of-pipe controls,management programs that are directed at pollutant sources are often morepracticable than relying solely on end-of-pipe controls. In past rulemakings, much of the critcism of the concept of subjectingdischarges from municipal separate storm sewers to the NPDES permit programfocused on the perception that the rigid regulatory program applied toindustrial process waters and effluents from public sewage treatment plantswas not appropriate for the site-specific nature of the sources which areresponsible for the discharge of pollutants from municipal storm sewers.The water quality impacts of discharges from municipal separate storm sewersystems depends on a wide range of factors including: the magnitude andduration of rainfall events, the time period between events, soil conditions,the fraction of land that is impervious to rainfall, land use activities,the presence of illicit connections, and the ratio of the storm water dischargeto receiving water flow. In enacting Section 405 of the WQA, Congress recognizedthat permit requirements for municipal separate storm sewer systems shouldbe developed in a flexible manner to allow site-specific permit conditionsto reflect the wide range of impacts that can be associated with thesedischarges. The legislative history accompanying the provision explainedthat ``[p]ermits for discharges from municipal separate stormwater systems* * * must include a requirement to effectively prohibit non-stormwaterdischarges into storm sewers and controls to reduce the discharge of pollutantsto the maximum extent practicable, * * * These controls may be differentin different permits. All types of controls listed in subsection [(p)(3)(C)]are not required to be incorporated into each permit'' (Vol. 132 Cong.Rec. H10576 (daily ed. October 15, 1986) Conference Report). Consistentwith the intent of Congress, EPA intends to develop permit applicationrequirements that are sufficiently flexible to allow the development ofsite-specific permit conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Large and Medium Municipal Storm Sewer Systems </ITAG>Earlier regulatory efforts addressing NPDES permit requirements for stormwater discharges required permits for discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers located in urbanized areas that were designated by the CensusBureau. The Census Bureau defines urbanized areas to provide a descriptionof the separation of urbanized and rural population and housing in thevicinity of large cities. A designated urbanized area consists of a centralcity or cities and surrounding closely settled territory or ``urban fringe''.Urbanized areas comprise an incorporated place and adjacent densely settledsurrounding area that together have a minimum population of 50,000. However,for a number of reasons, the NPDES permit program for municipal separatestorm sewers was not successfully implemented. During the reauthorization of the CWA, Congress intervened by reaffirmingits intent to establish a permit program for municipal separate storm sewersand establishing phased deadlines for its implementation. The amended CWAestablishes priorities for EPA to develop permit application requirementsand issue permits for discharges from three classes of municipal separatestorm sewer systems. The WQA requires that NPDES permits be issued fordischarges from large municipal separate storm sewer systems (systems servinga population of more than 250,000) by no later than February 4, 1991. Permitsfor discharges from medium municipal separate storm sewer systems (systemsserving a population of more than 100,000, but less than 250,000) mustbe issued by February 4, 1993. After October 1, 1992, the permit requirementsof the CWA are restored for all other discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers.The priorities established in the Act are based on the size of the populationserved by the system because, in general, discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers located in municipalities with higher populations are thoughtto present a higher potential for contributing to adverse water qualityimpacts. NURP and other studies have verified that the event mean concentrationof pollutants in urban runoff from residential and commercial areas remainsrelatively constant from one area to another, indicating that pollutantloads from urban runoff strongly depend on the total area of developedland, which in turn is related to population.The term ``municipal separate storm sewer system'' is not defined by theAct. By not defining the term, Congress intended to provide EPA discretionto define the scope of municipal systems consistent with the objectivesof developing site-specific management programs in permits to reduce pollutantsin discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems.In evaluating options for defining large and medium municipal separatestorm sewer systems, EPA will consider:andbullet; The inter-jurisdiction complexities associated with municipalgovernments;andbullet; The fact that many municipal storm water management programs havetraditionally focused on water quantity concerns, and have not evaluatedwater quality impacts of system discharges or developed measures to reducepollutants in such discharges;andbullet; The advantages of developing system-wide storm water managementprograms for municipal systems;andbullet; The geographic basis necessary for planning of comprehensive managementprograms to reduce pollutants in discharges from municipal separate stormsewers to the maximum extent practicable;andbullet; The geographic basis necessary to provide flexibility to targetcontrols on areas where water quality impacts associated with dischargesfrom municipal systems are the greatest and to provide an opportunity todevelop cost-effective controls;andbullet; Need to establish a reasonable number of permits for municipalsystems during the initial phases of program development that will providean adequate basis for a storm water quality management program for over13,000 municipalities after the October 1, 1992 general prohibition onstorm water permits expires; andandbullet; Congressional intent to allow the development of jurisdiction-wide,comprehensive storm water management programs with priorities given tothe most heavily populated areas of the country.<T3>a. Geographic Basis for Developing Storm Water Quality Management Programsfor Developed Areas. </T3>Municipal storm sewer systems are installed toprovide drainage for developed lands. In larger urbanized areas, extensivedevelopment continues beyond the boundaries of individual incorporatedcities and towns. The concentration of many pollutants in discharges frommunicipal separate storm sewers are often low relative to many industrialprocess and POTW discharges. However, where a widespread area supportsa high population, the cumulative impact of pollution loads associatedwith discharges from many municipal separate storm sewers can have significantwater quality impacts. Where water quality impacts are associated withdischarges from municipal storm sewer systems, the opportunity to developappropriate controls must be related to the pollution source.Most larger urbanized areas in the country are comprised of one or morecore cities surrounded by urbanized areas outside of the city boundaries.Often, the population which resides outside of the core cities greatlyexceeds the population which resides within the core cities' boundaries.Generally, the core areas have experienced development earlier than surroundingareas, with most new development occurring outside of the boundaries ofthe core cities. For urbanized areas which follow this model, it may oftenbe practicable to emphasize different aspects of a comprehensive stormwater quality management program to reduce pollutants in discharges fromseparate storm sewers in different parts of the urbanized area.Problems associated with illicit discharges of non-storm water to municipalseparate storm sewers are generally expected to be more severe in areaswhich have undergone extensive development prior to the enactment and implementationof ordinances and other controls which prohibit illicit discharges to separatestorm sewers. In these areas, identification and removal of illicit dischargesprovides opportunities for dramatic improvements in the quality of dischargesfrom separate storm sewers.In heavily developed areas, the opportunities for municipalities to implementsome types of controls to reduce pollutants in municipal separate stormsewer discharges may be limited by the scarcity of land for controls, thehigh cost of retrofitting and institutional constraints. Areas of new developmentoffer municipalities a more practicable opportunity to reduce pollutantsin storm water discharges for a number of reasons. First, land is morereadily available for structural controls such as detention and retentiondevices, which when incorporated into the design of a developing area canoften offer multipurpose amenities to the development and may raise thevalue of the development. Second, other controls such as grass swales andgrading patterns can be more easily implemented during the initial phasesof development. Also, programs such as those in Florida and Maryland havefocused on controls on new development because the storm water programcan be administratively coordinated with other administrative proceduresassociated with new development such as subdivision, grading or buildingapprovals.Ideally, storm water quality management controls should be planned, developed,and coordinated on a watershed basis. This is true because pollutants indischarges from municipal storm sewer systems can come from diffuse sourcesover a wide area and a comprehensive pollutant control program is oftenneeded to adequately protect receiving water quality. This geographicalapproach to water quality management has been identified as a key elementto success in reducing pollutant discharges associated with urban runoff.Also, watershed planning allows priorities to be evaluated as part of acomprehensive assessment of all pollutant sources (all point and non-pointsources) to the receiving water and the physical nature of the receivingwater. Finally, many storm water pollution controls also control peak flowrates. These measures to control water quality should be coordinated withwater quantity control measures. For example, retention basins which dischargeinto the lower portions of a watershed may create larger peak flows insmall or medium-sized rivers and streams by delaying discharges in thelower portion of the watershed to coincide with increased flows causedby runoff in the upper portions of the watershed. The increased peak flowsmay cause flooding problems or accelerate flow velocities which can acceleratestream-bank and stream-bed erosion. In this manner, situations where controlswhich affect the rate of flow have adverse impacts on downstream waterquality can be avoided.Unfortunately, several administrative burdens are associated with defining,for the purpose of implementing the WQA, municipal storm sewer systemson a watershed basis. First, it is difficult to accurately estimate thepopulation served by a given watershed. Second, watersheds do not followpolitical boundaries, thereby creating administrative difficulties in developingbasin-wide control programs. Finally, it is difficult to establish an objectivedefinition for the appropriate size of watershed basins, as smaller streamscombine to form larger ones. The EPA requests comments on the use of watershedboundaries to define large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems.Although the Agency does not prefer this option for large and medium systems,the Agency does favor incorporating watershed planning concepts and controlsinto the permit application requirements proposed in today's notice, andultimately into permits for municipal separate storm sewer systems. Asdiscussed in more detail later in today's notice, the permit applicationrequirements proposed in today's notice encourage that, where practicable,management plans be developed which are consistent with the nature of thewatershed. EPA requests comments on adapting the permit application requirementsdiscussed in today's notice to accommodate the development of managementprograms based on a watershed basis.<T3>b. Municipal Governments.</T3> A wide range of municipal entities mayhave primary responsibility for municipal storm sewers, including cities,towns, counties, flood control districts, and State Departments of Transportation.These municipalities perform a wide variety of other functions and aredelegated a wide variety of legal authority by the State in which theyare located. The potential role of various municipalities in reducing pollutantsin discharges from municipal separate storm sewers will vary greatly asreflected by the nature of the pollution problem and the legal authority,functions, and administrative and financial capabilities of the municipality.As discussed above, in larger urbanized areas, water quality impacts associatedwith diffuse sources contributing pollutants to discharges from municipalseparate storm sewers will extend beyond the boundaries of core cities.In these areas, it is possible that a significant number of municipalitiesmay own or operate municipal separate storm sewers.Section VII.G.2 of this preamble provides a proposed strategy for developingstorm water quality management programs for reducing pollutants in dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers through NPDES permits. The componentsof the storm water quality management programs discussed in today's noticecan be divided into two general categories. The first category is comprisedof measures that do not require the use of police powers to implement.These components include source identification measures associated withmapping, characterizing discharges by estimating flow rates, pollutantconcentrations, pollutant loadings, sampling discharges and identifyingillicit connections, and implementing certain controls to reduce pollutantssuch as public education measures to encourage proper oil disposal or recyclingor proper pesticide use. This category also includes activities such asmaintaining the separate sewers, and design and engineering methods suchas designs for new roads to minimize curb and gutter storm water collectionsystems. Municipal dischargers generally will not lack legal authorityto implement these components of the storm water quality management program.The second category is comprised of measures that generally may requiremunicipal police powers to implement. Examples of these types of controlsinclude reducing pollutants in construction site or industrial site runoffwhich discharges to municipal separate storm sewers. The police power requiredto implement these provisions can take a variety of forms including thepower to develop and enforce ordinances, contracts, orders or similar means.The municipal entity with primary control over a storm sewer may not havesufficient police powers to implement all aspects of a comprehensive stormwater quality management plan. In such cases, a combination of municipalentities may be required in order to guarantee sufficient legal authority,financial capability and administrative capability to implement all componentsof a storm water quality management program. The degree to which municipalitieswithout sufficient police powers are addressed is a major difference betweenthe options presented below for defining large and medium municipal separatestorm sewer systems.<T3>C. Options Considered.</T3> EPA requests comments on a number of optionsfor defining large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems. Generally,the options on which EPA is requesting comments can be classified intotwo categories. The first category of options, listed below as Options1, 2, 3, and 4 would define municipal systems in terms of the municipalentity which owns or operates storm sewers. The second category of optionswould define municipal systems on a geographic basis. With Options 5, 6,and 7, all municipal separate storm sewers within the specified geographicarea would be part of the municipal system, regardless of which municipalentity owns or operates the storm sewer.EPA favors those options for defining municipal separate storm sewer systemsthat rely primarily on the municipal entity which owns or operates or otherwisehas jurisdiction over storm sewers. These options are preferred becausethey will lessen the administrative complexities of initially developingthe permit program for discharges from municipal separate storm sewersby decreasing the number of municipal entities which will initially besubject to the permit program.EPA requests comments on a wide range of options. The Agency will use thecomments received on the various options when developing a final regulationdefining large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems. In addition,the Agency believes that in certain circumstances, comments received onthe various options will be beneficial when developing strategies for designatingmunicipal separate storm sewers on a system-wide basis under section 402(p)(2)(E)of the CWA for a permit prior to promulgation of final permit applicationregulations or prior to development of additional regulations under section402(p)(6) of the CWA.Also, EPA intends to consider those municipal separate storm sewers whichare ultimately not included in the definition of large and medium separatestorm sewer systems, along with other municipal storm sewers, in the studiesmandated under section 402(p)(5) of the CWA for appropriate regulationafter October 1, 1992 under section 402(p)(6) of the Act. Comments receivedduring this rulemaking, along with other information, will constitute aportion of the section 402(p)(5) study. Therefore, EPA requests commentson the appropriateness of all options for study under section 402(p)(5),and on corresponding procedures and methods to reduce pollutant in dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewer systems described in each option thatwould be appropriate as regulations under section 402(p)(6). EPA will,where appropriate, consider today's request for comments on the dischargesfrom those municipal separate storm sewers identified in the various optionsfor defining municipal systems as a proposal for regulation under section402(p)(6) and establish appropriate regulations (for example, the finalregulation may define large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systemas proposed in Option 1, and also promulgate permit application requirementsfor counties with a population of 100,000 or more in unincorporated areas(see Option 3) under section 402(p)(6) with a later date for permit applicationsubmittal).It should be noted that discharges from municipal separate storm sewersystems that are not included in the final regulatory definition of largeor medium municipal separate storm sewer system may still be required toobtain an NPDES permit if they are determined, under section 402(p)(2)(E)of the CWA, to be a significant contributor of pollutants or to be contributingto a violation of a water quality standard (see andSection; 122.26(a)(1)(v)of the proposed regulation). The Agency is considering the use of the section402(p)(2)(E) authority to determine the appropriate scope of large or mediummunicipal separate storm sewer systems on a case-by-case basis (see Option2 below).The Agency prefers to use different criteria to determine the appropriatescope of large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systems on a case-by-casebasis (see Option 1 below).The Agency also requests comments on whether non-municipal, non-industrialstorm water discharges (e.g., storm water discharges from Federal facilitieswithout industrial activities) that have been determined to be significantunder section 402(p)(2)(E) should be addressed as part of a large or mediummunicipal separate storm sewer system.In addition, the Agency requests comments on providing municipalities withan opportunity (see proposed andSection; 122.26(f)(3)), to submit a petitionto adjust the Census estimates of the population of the municipality toaccount for storm water discharges to combined sewers. The Agency prefersthat storm water discharges to combined sewers be addressed in permitsissued for discharges from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and from publiclyowned treatment works (POTWs).Option 1: Systems Owned or Operated by Incorporated Places Augmented byPotential Inclusion of Interrelated Discharges. EPA proposes that the definitionof large and medium municipal separate storm sewer system include thosemunicipal separate storm sewers owned or operated by ``incorporated places''with a population which exceeds the appropriate limit. (EPA is proposingto define the term ``incorporated place'' at 40 CFR 122.26(b)(3) to includethe District of Columbia, or a city, town or village that is incorporatedunder the laws of the State in which it is located. The proposed term ``incorporatedplace'' does not include county governments, and certain other municipalentities such as flood control districts, and sewer districts.)The Agency believes that this approach would provide for the initial developmentof core storm water management programs in the largest cities in the Nation.The Census Bureau estimates for 1986 indicate that 60 incorporated placeshave populations of more than 250,000 and that 122 places have populationsof more than 100,000 but less than 250,000. The Agency recognizes thatmany of these cities currently do not have comprehensive programs to addressstorm water quality. In addition, most of the NPDES States and EPA Regionshave limited experience in addressing storm water quality management inthe comprehensive manner that is envisioned in this rulemaking. Becauseof the relative newness of the storm water NPDES program for dischargesfrom municipal systems, the Agency anticipates that, generally, more resourceswill be needed to begin to implement the initial phases of the program,and therefore, Option 1 provides a reasonable and realistic basis for theinitial phases of development of this program. In addition, this optionprovides the maximum flexibility for EPA to continue to study the appropriatemanner to expand the NPDES program after October 1, 1992 for dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers. In this manner, additional flexibilityto develop requirements which are tailored to the legal nature and capabilitiesof various municipalities will be provided.Option 1 focusses primarily on discharges from municipal separate stormsewer systems that are owned or operated by one municipality, an ``incorporatedplace'' with a population of 250,000 or more, or of 100,000 or more. However,in many cases, discharges from municipal separate storm sewers owned oroperated by ``incorporated places'' with a population of 250,00 or more,or of 100,000 or more, will have interrelated impacts and be otherwiseinterrelated (but not necessarily physically interconnected) to dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers owned or operated by municipal entities<T3>other than </T3>an ``incorporated place'' with a population of 250,000or more, or 100,000 or more. Wide differences in the physical nature andin water-quality impacts can be expected between drainage systems of variousdeveloped areas, as well as differences in the legal authorities and jurisdictionsassociated with municipalities responsible for storm water discharges.EPA prefers the Director of the NPDES program make case-by-case decisionson the total scope of each large and medium municipal separate storm sewersystem. The Agency is proposing that the definitions of large and mediummunicipal separate storm sewer system provide for case-by-case designationof interrelated discharges from municipal separate storm sewers that areowned or operated by municipal entities <T3>other than </T3>an ``incorporated place'' with a population of 250,000or more, or 100,000 or more based on a discretionary consideration of:the physical interconnections between the municipal separate storm sewers;the location of discharges; the quantity and nature of pollutants discharged;the nature of the receiving waters; or other relevant factors (see proposedandSection; 122.26(b)(4)(ii) and (7)(ii)). For example, discharges from separatestorm sewers associated with a State highway running through an ``incorporatedplace'' with a population of over 100,000 along with discharges from separatestorm sewers owned by the ``incorporated place'' may adversely impact astream. In such a case, the Director may consider designating the dischargefrom the State highway as <T3>part </T3>of the municipal separate storm sewer system serving that``incorporated place''.Accordingly, the proposed definitions of the terms large and medium municipalseparate storm sewer system are intended to provide, within the definitionsthemselves, a flexible and administratively simple way for the Directorto decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether and how to include other relevant``interrelated'' municipal discharges (for example, discharges from oneor more other adjacent smaller municipalities' separate storm sewers systems)into each large or medium municipal separate storm sewer system for NPDESpermitting purposes. The approach in the proposed definitions would notrequire the Director to first determine that the smaller municipality'sdischarge meets the standard of section 402(p)(2)(E).Thus, under Option 1, a consideration of location-specific factors wouldprovide flexibility to establish the appropriate total scope of each ``municipalseparate storm sewer system''. In addition, this approach may reduce theburden on some municipalities designated into the ``system'' when theyparticipate, with the ``incorporated place'' whose storm sewers are thecore of the same system in the development of a single system-wide permitapplication.The municipality to be designated into the NPDES-regulated ``system'' onthis basis would not have to meet any criteria for size of population.EPA requests comments on the appropriate criteria and procedures for designatingother municipalities into the large and medium municipal separate stormsewer systems on a case-by-case basis.Option 2: Systems Owned or Operated by Incorporated Places Augmented byIncluding Other Municipal Discharges Determined to be Significant UnderSection 402(p)(2)(E) Authority. This Option is similar to Option 1, inthat it would focus primarily on discharges from municipal separate stormsewer systems that are owned or operated by one municipality, an ``incorporatedplace'' with a population of 250,000 or more, or of 100,000 or more. However,this option would differ in the approach to addressing interrelated municipalseparate storm sewer discharges from multiple municipalities.Under Option 2, a discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer thatis owned or operated by a municipal entity <T3>other than</T3> an incorporated place with a population of 250,000or more or a population of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000, couldbe designated as <T3>part</T3> of the large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systemif the Director of the NPDES program determines that the discharge is contributingto a violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributorof pollutants to waters of the United States. Such a determination couldbe based on the consideration of: the location of the discharge with respectto waters of the United States; the size of the discharge; the quantityand nature of the pollutants discharged to waters of the United States;and other relevant factors (see andSection;122.26(a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of theproposed regulation).This option provides different designation criteria and standards and lessadministrative flexibility than the designation process described in Option1. Option 2 would still allow consideration of location specific factors,but would establish a more stringent threshold which must be met beforeexpanding the scope of a large or medium municipal separate storm sewersystem on a case-by-case basis.Municipalities included in the NPDES-regulated ``system'' on the basisof section 402(p)(2)(E) would not have to meet any specific criteria basedon size of population.As in Option 1, Option 2 may reduce the burden on some municipalities deemedto be part of the large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systemwhen they participate, with the ``incorporated place'' whose storm sewersare the core of the same ``system'', in the development of a single system-widepermit application.EPA request comments on the appropriate criteria and procedures for makingcase-by-case determinations of the scope of large and medium municipalseparate storm sewer systems using the andSection;402(p)(2)(E) authority.Option 3: Systems Owned or Operated by Counties. In most States, the primarydivisions of the State are counties. In Louisiana, the primary divisionsare parishes. In Alaska, the State is divided into organized or unorganizedboroughs.The importance of a county in the government structure of a State variesgreatly from State to State. In some western and southern States, countiesare divided into townships for limited administrative purposes. In theseStates, the county is the basic unit of government. In a group of Statesextending from New York and New Jersey into the Mid-West, the entire countymay be divided into townships. In other States, the county is divided intoincorporated and unincorporated areas, with the importance of the countygovernment varying throughout the county. Generally, counties have an importantrole in highway construction and maintenance (the Census Bureau estimatesthat, nation-wide, counties are responsible for 32 percent of the expendituresof local governments made for highways), and may assume other responsibilitiesfor drainage.EPA requests comments on extending the definition of large and medium municipalseparate storm sewers to include, in addition to municipal separate stormsewer systems owned or operated by an incorporated place with a populationequal to, or exceeding the appropriate limit, storm sewers that are ownedor operated by a county government entity in counties with the appropriatepopulation. Under this approach, municipal separate storm sewers ownedor operated by cities, towns, townships, boroughs and other municipal entitieswith a population of less than 100,000 within the county would not be definedas part of the county system.As discussed above, the legal authority of county governments will varyfrom State to State, and in many counties may vary throughout the county.To successfully implement this approach with respect to county owned oroperated separate storm sewers, permits will have to incorporate stormwater quality management programs which would reflect and be compatiblewith the variations in the county government's legal authority. Thus, therequirements in the management program may vary to reflect the legal authorityof the county in a given location. For example, in unincorporated areasof the county, where the county is the primary municipal entity, the stormwater quality management program may have all of the appropriate componentsthat are discussed in today's notice. However, in certain areas of thecounty with incorporated places with a population of less than 100,000,the permit may only address control measures which do not require legalauthority to implement (see above).Census estimates for 1986 indicate that 185 counties have populations of250,000 or more, while 225 counties have populations of 100,000 or more,but less than 250,000. After considering the number of permits that wouldbe initially required under this option, along with the extensive surfacearea covered by the combined counties, the Agency believes that this optionis not practicable for the initial phases of program development. Ratherthan addressing all counties with a population of 250,000 or more or between100,000 and 250,000, many of which encompass extensive rural areas, inthe initial phases of program development the Agency will consider variousalternatives for establishing the size of the population which is servedby the county.EPA also requests comment on basing the definition of the population servedby the municipal storm sewer system on the population of a county whichresides within urbanized areas that have been defined by the Census Bureau.This system of measuring populations would provide a means to establishpriorities for counties based on the amount of urban developed land inthe county. Although all municipal storm sewers owned or operated by anapplicable county would be part of the municipal separate storm sewer system,and would be subject to permit requirements, measures to reduce pollutantsto the maximum extent practicable would be focused on where water qualityimprovements are needed, i.e., on the most heavily populated areas of thecounty and on industrial lands, which are generally expected to cause morewater quality impacts.EPA also requests comment on defining the population served by the countyowned or operated municipal storm sewer system as that population of thecounty which resides outside of incorporated areas of the county. Thisapproach would focus on counties with high populations in unincorporatedareas, because these counties would be assumed to generally have greaterlegal authority, and financial capability for developing and implementinga storm water quality management program. This approach assumes that, inunincorporated areas of a county with a high population, the county governmentis the functional equivalent of an incorporated government.Option 4: Systems Owned and Operated by States. Each State has an extensiveseparate storm sewer system that drains State highways. EPA requests commentson, in addition to other systems of municipal storm sewers, all separatestorm sewers associated with State highways should constitute a singlesystem. This approach may simplify the permit application and issuanceprocess for State Departments of Transportation and for the permit issuingagency by consolidating all State highways into one system. In addition,this approach provides a basis for consistent regulation of municipal separatestorm sewers associated with State highways which would allow prioritiesto be established on a consideration of the entire State system. EPA isconsidering this option in conjunction with other options (for example,EPA could define large municipal separate sewer systems to include municipalstorm sewers described in Option 1 and Option 4).Option 5: Incorporated Place Boundaries. Within the boundaries of an incorporatedplace, in addition to the storm sewer owned or operated by the incorporatedplace, some municipal separate storm sewers may be operated by county agencies,State agencies, flood control districts or sewer districts.Option 5 differs from Option 1 in that all municipal separate storm sewerswithin an incorporated place with an appropriate population would alwaysbe part of the municipal system, instead of beginning with only those municipalstorm sewers owned or operated by the incorporated place. Where multipleagencies within a single jurisdiction have storm water management responsibilities,the Agency would consider appropriate interagency agreements to ensurethe development of comprehensive control programs and the development ofpermit conditions which may, for a given discharge, require one municipalentity to implement one set of controls which require police power to implementand another municipal entity to implement a different set of controls whichpertain to the operation of the storm sewer.This approach would create some additional complexity to the initial phasesof development of the NPDES storm water program by increasing the scopeof the program to include additional municipal permittees. Option 5 wouldalso provide for case-by-case designations as discussed under Option 1for interrelated discharges from municipal separate storm sewers outsideof the incorporated place with a population of 250,000 or more, or of 100,000or more.However, the basis of the Option 5 approach would ensure that all dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers within the incorporated place wereinitially addressed under the NPDES program and would provide a mechanismfor developing intergovernmental agreements where necessary.Option 6: County Boundaries. EPA requests comments on defining large andmedium municipal separate storm sewer systems to include all municipalseparate storm sewers that are located in a county with a population thatexceeds the appropriate statutory population limit. Under this approach,all municipal separate storm sewers that are located within a county withthe appropriate population would constitute a large or medium municipalsystem.The Agency does not favor defining large and medium municipal systems basedon county boundaries at this time because of the extremely large numberof municipal entities which would be affected during the initial phasesof the storm water program. In addition to the 410 counties with populationsof 100,000 or more, several thousand other municipal entities would beaffected under this approach. The Agency prefers to develop core programswithin the central cities before addressing these municipalities. For thisreason, EPA prefers, at this time, to continue to consider this optionunder the studies mandated under Section 402(p)(5).In comparing this option to option 1, it should be noted that addressingdischarges from separate storm sewers within counties would, in largerurbanized areas, provide a geographic basis necessary for the planningof comprehensive programs to reduce pollutants in discharges from municipalseparate storm sewer systems to the maximum extent practicable.The EPA believes that basing the definition of large and medium municipalstorm sewer systems on counties would offer additional flexibility in developingpollution control strategies and targeting controls where water qualityimprovements are needed and can be achieved in a practicable manner. Forexample, the NURP study indicated that it is much more feasible and cost-effectiveto develop controls for areas that are in the process of being developedthan it is to develop controls for areas that are more fully developed.This option would allow municipalities flexibility to address storm waterconcerns associated with many areas of rapid development, rather than relyingmore heavily on retrofitting controls in older urban core areas definedby city limits.The water quality impacts of urban runoff are generally more significantfor smaller rivers and streams where the ratio of the portion of the drainagebasin that is developed to the portion that is undeveloped is relativelyhigh. The county option provides an adequate basis to address existingand future water quality impacts associated with municipal separate stormsewers for many of these water bodies.Option 7: Unbanized Areas. The storm water permit application regulationsthat were promulgated in September 26, 1984 established the scope of therequirement to obtain a permit by limiting the definition of storm waterpoint source as it related to municipal separate storm sewers to areasthat were located on urbanized areas designated by the Bureau of Census.Prior to the enactment of the WQA, the use of the urbanized area designationto limit the scope of NPDES permit program served as an important toolto establish manageable limits on the large administrative burden associatedwith preparing and processing permit applications for individual dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers. However, the WQA provides severalmechanisms which ease this burden, including authorizing the Director toissue permits for municipal storm sewers on a system- or jurisdiction-widebasis, thereby greatly reducing the administrative burden associated withpermitting municipal storm sewers. Under this new authority, the advantagesof retaining the use of urban area designations to determine initial permitapplicability are outweighed by the difficulties associated with definingwhich discharges are within the urban area and with using urban area boundarieswhich often do not follow political boundaries. Because the boundariesof urban areas do not follow political boundaries, this option may createadditional administrative complexity where some discharges from in a givenmunicipality are addressed initially, and other discharges in other partsof the municipality must be addressed later under regulations developedunder section 402(p)(6). Further, the urban areas designated in 1980 donot include many other areas that are undergoing rapid development today.Using more recent estimates of urban areas may create uncertainty in theregulatory definition. Also, areas of new development would not be addresseduntil after the development had progressed significantly, and therefore,opportunities to limit pollutants from the areas of new development wouldbe limited. Nationwide, urban areas increased by approximately 4% in areaannually.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. System-Wide Permit Applications</ITAG>Section 402(p)(3)(B)(i) of the amended CWA provides that permits for municipaldischarges from municipal storm sewers may be issued on a system-wide orjurisdiction-wide basis. This provision is an important tool towards reachingthe goal of developing the comprehensive storm water management programsenvisioned by the Act.The system-wide permit approach represents a drastic change from the regulatoryapproach taken in the 1984 regulations, which required individual permitapplications for each outfall located in a Census designated urban area.The 1984 permit applications were to serve as the basis for developingconditions for individual permits for each discharge. EPA proposes to abandonthe individual permit approach for municipal storm sewer outfalls in favorof a program approach that will allow system-wide planning and implementationand appropriate targeting of controls based on an evaluation of priorities.Under the permit application requirements proposed in today's rule, ifthe appropriate co-applicants are identified, one permit application maybe submitted for a large or medium municipal separate storm sewer system(see andSection; VII.E.4 above). System-wide permit applications can in turnbe used to issue system-wide permits which could cover all discharges inthe system.Where several municipal entities are responsible for obtaining a permitfor various discharges within a single systems, the Agency will encouragesystem-wide permit applications involving the several municipal entitiesfor a number of reasons. The system-wide approach not only provides anappropriate basis for planning activities and coordinating development,but also provides municipal entities participating in a system-wide applicationthe means to spread the resource burden of monitoring, evaluating waterquality impacts, and developing and implementing controls. The system-wideapproach provided in today's notice recognizes differences between individualmunicipalities with responsibilities for discharges from the municipalsystem by allowing for different permit conditions to apply to differentmunicipalities. To encourage this flexibility, the permit application requirementsproposed in today's notice allow individual municipalities participatingin system-wide applications to submit information regarding municipalityspecific storm water quality management programs to reduce pollutants insystem discharges.In some cases, it may be undesirable for all municipal entities with stormwater responsibility within a municipal system to be co-permittees underone system-wide permit. The permit application requirements proposed intoday's notice allow individual municipal entities within the system tosubmit permit applications and obtain a permit for that portion of thestorm sewer system for which they are responsible. Thus, several permitsmay be issued to cover various subdivisions of a single municipal system.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Co-Permittees to System-wide Permits</ITAG>Although several of the proposed options for defining large and mediumseparate storm sewer systems focus primarily on municipal separate stormsewers that are owned or operated by incorporated cities, towns or villageswith the appropriate population (e.g., options 1, 2, or 5), the definitionof the ``system'' could be modified by the Director of the NPDES programon a case-by-case basis to include municipal separate storm sewers ownedor operated by other municipal entities.To accommodate the issuance of permits in which several municipalitiesare co-permittees, the permit applications for municipal storm sewers describedin today's proposal have been designed to facilitate multiple municipalagencies (i.e. flood control districts, local governments, State Departmentsof Transportation) submitting a joint permit application appropriate forissuing system-wide permits with multiple co-permittees. EPA is requestingcomments on this approach, and when it would be appropriate to tailor thepermit application requirements to meet the needs of different types ofmunicipal agencies (for example, should distinct permit application requirementsbe developed for State Departments of Transportation).G. Permit Application Requirements for Large and Medium Municipal SystemsThe August 12, 1985 notice had proposed to clarify that storm water dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewers would be classified as Group I stormwater discharges. The Group I classification, indicating a higher potentialfor contributing to an adverse environmental impact, was justified on thebasis of data from the NURP study of urban runoff which indicate that inmany instances BOD loadings in urban runoff were estimated as comparableto that from secondary treatment facilities, while TSS loadings were estimatedto be a factor of ten times higher than loadings from secondary treatmentplants. The NURP study also found high levels of heavy metals and severalorganic chemicals in urban runoff.The Group I classification triggered permit application requirements whichincluded quantitative data sampling for each Group I outfall. In the August12, 1985 notice, EPA proposed to require that quantitative sampling datafor all outfalls from municipal separate storm systems be submitted inpermit applications. Eight comments were received on this issue. Six ofthe commenters objected to the proposal because they felt that such a requirementwould create an undue burden on municipalities which have many outfalls.Some municipalities suggested identifying the area drained by the systemand then selecting points for representative sampling. Another commenterargued that if three or four outfalls are receiving similar runoff, theparticipant should only be required to sample one outfall. Other commenterssuggested that only outfalls that are suspected of having pollution problemsshould be tested, although no basis for determining such ``problem'' outfallswere offered. Two of the eight commenters, both State agencies, felt thatall outfalls should be tested.Today's notice proposes to abandon the Group I classification system andrequests comments on replacing the prior permit application system fordischarges from municipal systems, based primarily on sampling all outfalls,with a system that involves comprehensive system-wide evaluation of pollutantsources. The permit application requirements for discharges from largeand medium municipal separate storm sewer systems proposed in today's noticedo not focus on the collection of data at each outfall of the municipalsystem, but rather require a screening analysis to identify areas of thesystem affected by illicit non-storm water discharges and some representativesampling.The permit applications for municipal storm sewer systems proposed in today'snotice are applicable to large municipal storm sewer systems (systems servinga population of more than 250,000); medium municipal storm sewer systems(systems serving a population of more than 100,000 but less than 250,000)and any other municipal separate storm sewer system that is required toobtain a permit that the Administrator or NPDES State designates undersection 402(p)(2)(E).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Strategy for Implementing the Permit Program</ITAG>Given the differing nature of discharges from municipal separate stormsewer systems in different parts of the country, and the varying waterquality impact of municipal storm sewer discharges on receiving waters,EPA intends to develop permit application requirements designed to leadto the development of site-specific storm water management programs. Inorder to effectively implement this goal, EPA is currently rethinking theappropriate structure and purpose of the NPDES permit program as it appliesto municipal separate storm sewers systems. EPA believes that the appropriatepermitting strategy (including both the permit application and the permit)for controlling pollutants from municipal separate storm sewers shouldinvolve the following components:andbullet; Identifying significant sources of pollutants;andbullet; Characterizing pollutants associated with discharges from themunicipal separate storm sewer system;andbullet; Estimating expected changes in the characteristics of pollutantsin discharges from the municipal separate storm sewer system associatedwith population growth and changes in land use activities;andbullet; Initially assessing impacts on the water quality of receivingwater bodies;andbullet; Proposing controls to reduce pollutants to the maximum extentpracticable;andbullet; Estimating the changes in the characteristics of pollutants indischarges from municipal separate storm sewer systems associated withproposed controls;andbullet; Modifying the proposal of controls to reduce pollutants to reachdesired objective (control pollutants to the maximum extent practicable);andbullet; Implementing controls; andandbullet; Evaluating changes in water quality associated with implementingcontrols.EPA is proposing to structure the permit application requirements for large-and medium-sized municipal systems to address: andbullet; The development of a municipal storm water management programto control pollutants in municipal storm water discharges. Viable managementprograms must have adequate legal authority and financial capabilitiesto ensure compliance with permit conditions;  andbullet; A process to identify sources which contribute pollutants to municipalstorm water discharges;  andbullet; Initial characterization of the discharges from the municipalstorm sewer system; and  andbullet; Proposed management plans to reduce the discharge of pollutantsfrom municipal storm sewers to the maximum extent practicable.  This information is necessary to allow permits to be based on site-specificbest professional judgement evaluations of appropriate pollution controlmeasures. EPA requests comment on the overall strategy for developing apermit program for discharges from municipal separate storm sewers andon which aspects of the strategy should be incorporated into permit applications. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Structure of the Permit Application  </ITAG>EPA is proposing a two part permit application that is consistent withthe goal of developing site-specific water quality management programsfor storm water in NPDES permits  <T3>a. Part 1 Application. </T3>Part 1 of the permit application is intendedto provide an adequate basis for identifying sources of pollutants to themunicipal storm sewer system; to preliminarily identify discharges of stormwater that are appropriate for individual permits; and to formulate a strategyfor characterizing the discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems.The components of Part 1 of the permit application include a descriptionof: andbullet; General information regarding the permit applicant or co-applicants(andSection;122.26(d)(1)(i));  andbullet; A description of the existing legal authority of the applicant(s)to control pollutants in storm water discharges and a plan to augment legalauthority where necessary (andSection;122.26(d)(1)(ii));  andbullet; Source identification information including a description of thehistoric use of ordinances or other controls which limited the dischargeof non-storm water discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systemsand the location of known municipal separate storm sewer outfalls (andSection;122.26(d)(1)(iii));andbullet; Information characterizing the nature of system discharges includingexisting quantitative data, the results of a field screening analysis todetect illicit discharges and illegal dumping to the municipal system;an identification of receiving waters with known water quality impactsassociated with storm water discharges; a proposed plan to characterizedischarges from the municipal storm sewer system by estimating pollutantloads and the concentration of representative discharges, and a plan toobtain representative data (andSection;122.26(d)(1)(iv)); and andbullet; A description of existing structural and non-structural controlsto reduce the discharge of pollutants from the municipal storm sewer (andSection;122.26(d)(1)(v)).andbullet; The submittal of Part 1 of the permit application will allow EPA,or approved NPDES States, to adjust the Part 2 permit application requirementsto assure flexibility in developing permit application requirements thatare appropriate for the permit applicant given the site specific characteristicsof the municipal storm sewer system.  <T3>b. Part 2 Application. </T3>Part 2 of the proposed permit applicationis designed to supplement information provided in the Part 1 permit applicationand to provide municipalities with the opportunity of proposing a comprehensiveprogram of structural and non-structural control measures that will controlthe discharge of pollutants, to the maximum extent practicable, from municipalstorm sewers. The components of the proposed Part 2 permit applicationinclude: andbullet; A demonstration that the legal authority of the permit applicantsatisfies regulatory criteria (andSection;122.26(d)(2)(i));  andbullet; Supplementation of the source identification information submittedin the Part 1 application to assure that all major outfalls are identified(andSection;122.26(d)(2)(ii));  andbullet; Information to characterize discharges from the municipal systemincluding quantitative data from a screening analysis for detecting illicitdischarges and illegal dumping, representative data and estimates of pollutantloadings and concentrations of pollutants in discharges (andSection;122.26(d)(2)(iii)); andbullet; A proposed management program to control the discharge of pollutantsto the maximum extent practicable, from municipal storm sewers (andSection;122.26(d)(2)(iv)); andbullet; Assessment of the performance of proposed controls (andSection;122.26(d)(2)(v)); andbullet; A financial analysis estimating the cost of implementing the proposedmanagement programs along with identifying sources of revenue (andSection;122.26(d)(2)(vi));and  andbullet; A description of the roles and responsibilities of co-applicants(andSection;122.26(d)(2)(vii)).  In addition to providing site-specific information, the permit applicationrequirements proposed in today's notice have been designed to allow municipalitiesan opportunity to propose the set of controls that, in the applicant'sopinion, representing the most appropriate means of controlling the dischargeof pollutants from municipal storm sewer systems. These proposed planswill be used by the permitting authority to develop permit conditions tocontrol pollutants in the discharges from municipal separate storm sewersystems to the maximum extent practicable. This overall scheme recognizesthat local government entities have a critical responsibility for evaluatingthe nature and sources of pollutant discharges from municipal separatestorm sewer systems and for devising appropriate methods of control. Properdevelopment of proposed municipal storm water management programs affordsmunicipalities the opportunity to propose model conditions for their ownpermits.      <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Major outfalls</ITAG>In past rulemakings, a controversial issue has been the appropriate samplingrequirements for municipal separate storm sewer systems. Earlier stormwater rulemakings have been based primarily on the principle that all dischargesto waters of the United States from municipal separate storm sewers locatedin urban areas must be covered by an individual permit. This approach requiredthat individual permit applications contain quantitative data to be submittedfor all such discharges. This approach was criticized because of the extremelylarge number of outfalls in some municipal separate storm sewer systems.Most incorporated cities with a population of 100,000 or more do not knowthe exact number of outfalls from their municipal systems, but estimatesrange from 50 to 1,000 or more.Under the approach taken in earlier rulemakings, the impacts of pollutantloads and impacts on ambient water concentration from municipal storm sewersystems would be analyzed by evaluating samples from all of the dischargesfrom the system. This approach would involve evaluating water quality impactsthrough the use of models to estimate pollutant loads and to estimate ambientwater concentrations during and immediately after storm events, and tocalibrate the models using the quantitative data from each outfall. Underthis earlier approach, limited information regarding pollutant sourceswould be available in the permit application to select appropriate modelsfor estimating pollutant loads. Rather, relatively general models wouldbe used which relied on limited quantitative data to assure that the modelwas calibrated.In light of the increased flexibility provided by the WQA for regulatingmunicipal separate storm sewer discharges, the approach proposed in today'snotice will not require submittal of individual permit applications withquantitative data for each outfall of a municipal system, but rather willencourage systemwide permit applications to provide information suitablefor developing effective storm water management programs. Under this approach,not all outfalls of the municipal system will be sampled, but rather morespecific and accurate models for estimating pollutant loads and dischargeconcentrations will be used. The use of these models will require the identificationof sources which are responsible for discharging pollutants into municipalseparate storm sewers and will not require as much data to calibrate dueto the source-specific nature of the model. A number of standard and localizedmodels have been developed for estimating pollutant loads from storm waterdischarges. For example, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) hasdeveloped four sets of regression equations for 10 pollutants in urbanrunoff (see ``Estimation of the Urban Storm-Runoff Quality and QuantityData in Metropolitan Areas throughout the United States'', 1988). The NURPstudy provides event mean concentration estimates for 10 pollutants. EPArequests comments on the use of these and other standard and localizedmodels.By adopting an approach that incorporates source identification measures,the amount of quantitative data required to characterize discharges fromthe municipal systems will be reduced because of the increased accuracyof site-specific models which can be used. Consistent with a system-widepermit application approach, EPA is proposing to focus source identificationmeasures on ``major outfalls''. The proposed definition of major outfallsincludes any municipal separate storm sewer outfall that discharges froma pipe with a diameter of more than 36 inches or its equivalent (dischargesfrom a drainage area of more than 50 acres); or municipal separate stormsewers that receive storm water from lands zoned for industrial activities,an outfall that discharges from a pipe with a diameter of more than 12inches or its equivalent (discharges from a drainage area of 2 acres ormore). EPA views that it is appropriate to focus source identificationand characterization measures conducted as permit application requirementson these outfalls to provide initial screening information that will allowpriorities to be set for the system. However, it should be clarified that<T3>all</T3> outfalls from medium and large municipal separate storm sewersystems need to be covered by the permit applications proposed in today'snotice and that <T3>all</T3> outfalls from such systems will need to be covered by a permit.EPA requests comments on the proposed definition of major outfall, andwhether outfalls with a diameter of more than 36 inches or its equivalent,or for municipal separate storm sewers that receive storm water from landszoned for industrial activities, an outfall that discharges from a pipewith a diameter of more than 12 inches or its equivalent provides an appropriatenumber of outfalls for focusing source identification requirements. Wherepracticable, comments should include data indicating the distribution ofoutfall sizes within municipal systems.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Viable Program</ITAG>Perhaps the most important function of the NPDES permit program for municipalseparate storm sewers is to ensure that local governments establish viableprograms to control pollutants in discharges from municipal separate stormsewers. The proposed permit application requirements address three componentsof a viable local program for controlling pollutants in discharges frommunicipal separate storm sewers: legal authority, financial and administrativecapability. The ability of a permit applicant or a set of permit applicantsto satisfy these criteria will be evaluated in light of the site-specificproposed management plans proposed at 122.26(d)(2)(iv) (discussed in andSection;VII.E.7 of the preamble).Although pollutants in discharges from municipal separate storm sewerscan be controlled by providing end-of-pipe treatment, many representativesfrom municipalities have expressed concerns that providing treatment forall outfalls from large and medium municipal separate storm systems istechnically and economically infeasible. These representatives have expresseda willingness to explore alternative methods, such as developing a varietyof preventive source control measures, to control pollutants in such discharges.However, if source controls are to function in lieu of end-of-pipe treatment,then the permittee, or a set of co-permittees, must have adequate legalauthority to ensure that controls on discharges to a municipal storm sewerare implemented and that permit conditions based on source control measuresdo not become ineffective ``paper'' requirements.EPA is proposing that municipal separate storm sewer system permit applicantsdemonstrate legal authority established by statute, ordinance, or seriesof contracts which authorizes or enables the applicant at a minimum to:andbullet; Control through ordinance, permit, contract, order or similarmeans, the contribution of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer by eachstorm water discharge associated with industrial activity;andbullet; Prohibit through ordinance, order or similar means, the dischargeof illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer;andbullet; Control through ordinance, order or similar means, the dischargeto a municipal separate storm sewer of spills, dumping or disposal of materialsother than storm water;andbullet; Control through interagency agreements among coapplicants thecontribution of pollutants from one portion of the municipal system toanother portion of the municipal system;andbullet; Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits, contractsor orders; andandbullet; Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring proceduresnecessary to determine compliance and non-compliance with permit conditionsincluding the prohibition on illicit discharges to the municipal separatestorm sewer.EPA requests comments on the process by which municipal applicants shoulddemonstrate legal authority and how EPA should evaluate the legal authorityof municipal applicants.In order to ensure that all permit conditions, including both structuraland source control measures, are implemented, EPA is proposing to requirethat permittees demonstrate that they have the fiscal resources and administrativecapabilities to carry out the objectives of the permit.EPA is proposing to require municipal permit applicants to submit a fiscalanalysis of expenditures that will be required in order to implement theproposed management plans required in Part 2 of the application. The descriptionof fiscal resources should include a description of the source of the funds.EPA is requesting comments as to the appropriateness of these criteriafor permit applicants for municipal separate storm sewer systems and onwhat additional criteria should be defined to ensure a viable program tocontrol pollutants in discharges from municipal storm sewers.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Source Identification</ITAG>The identification of sources which contribute pollutants to municipalseparate storm sewers is a critical step in characterizing the nature andextent of pollutants in discharges and in developing appropriate controlmeasures. Source identification can be useful for providing an analysisof pollutant source contribution and for identifying the relationship betweenpollutant sources and receiving water quality problems. In cases whereend-of-pipe controls alone are not practicable, it is essential to identifythe source of pollutants into the municipal storm sewer systems to supporta targeted approach to control pollutant sources.The relative contribution of pollutants from various sources will be highlysite-specific. The first step in developing a targeted approach for controllingpollutants in discharges from municipal storm sewer systems is identifyingthe various sources in each drainage basin that will contribute pollutantsto the municipal storm sewer system.Source identification information can serve as the basis for loading estimates(see andSection; VII.E.6.C) and the identification of those discharges tothe municipal system with a higher potential to create adverse environmentalimpacts.EPA is proposing to phase in the source identification requirements ofthe permit program by establishing minimum objectives in Part 1 of theapplication and by requiring applicants to submit a source identificationplan in Part 2 of the application to provide additional information duringthe term of the permit. The minimum source identification requirementsof Part 1 have been designed to provide sufficient information to providean initial characterization of pollutants in the discharges from the municipalstorm sewer system. EPA realizes that with many large, complex municipalstorm sewer systems, it may be difficult to identify all outfalls duringthe permit application process. EPA is proposing that known outfalls bereported in Part 1 of the application. Part 1 of the application will alsoinclude a description of procedures and a proposed program to identifyadditional major outfalls. The information required in the proposed Part1 application also includes identification of the drainage area associatedwith known outfalls, a description of major land use classifications ineach drainage area, descriptions of soils, the location of industrial facilities,open dumps, landfills or RCRA hazardous waste facilities which dischargestorm water to the municipal storm sewer system.Although many municipalities have extensive information regarding the networkof conveyances in their municipal separate storm sewer systems, othersdo not. Municipalities without existing maps would face extreme difficultiesin attempting to identify during the permit application process the networkof conveyances in their municipal systems. Therefore, applicants are <T3>not</T3> required to identify the conveyance network of the municipalsystem, but rather need to provide the location of major outfalls (certainpoints where the municipal system discharges to waters of the United States)and estimates of the area drained by the portion of the system associatedwith the outfall.In addition to identifying outfalls from municipal storm sewer systemsfor the development of a management program to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges, it is also important to identify the location of suchoutfalls to clarify where the storm sewer system ends and where watersof the United States begin. In many situations, waters of the United Statesthat receive discharges from municipal storm sewers can be mistakenly consideredto be part of the storm sewer system. Permit applicants should refer tothe regulatory definition of waters of the United States at 40 CFR 122.2for appropriate guidance. The Director of the NPDES program will be ableto make any necessary clarifications during the application process.The proposed Part 1 application requires applicants to submit ten yearprojections of population growth and development activities. Populationdata and development projections will be useful for future predictionsof loadings to receiving waters from municipal storm sewer systems, andcapacities required for treatment systems. In general, population projectionsshould reflect various scenarios of development (high, medium, low relativeto recent trends).Part 2 of the application will supplement the information reported in thePart 1 application so that, at a minimum, all major outfalls are identified.Some municipalities, in recognition of the importance of mapping and sourceidentification, have already developed extensive maps of their municipalstorm sewer system. In addition, much of the information required in today'sproposal will usually have been compiled by other planning agencies ina variety of forms such as land use plans and soil survey maps. Populationdata are readily available from the Census Bureau, municipal planning departmentsor public utility records.Although municipalities or public entities may not keep records identifyingdischargers into the storm water collection system, methods usually existfrom which such information can be gathered (e.g., water and sewer bills,tax records, zoning permits, etc.). EPA is also proposing that facilitiesthat discharge storm water associated with industrial activity to largeor medium municipal separate storm sewer systems submit notifications ofthe discharge to the municipality (see proposed andSection;122.26(a)(3)(vii)).Under today's proposal, municipal or public entities responsible for applyingfor and obtaining an NPDES permit will be required to identify the locationof an open dump, sanitary landfill, municipal incinerator or hazardouswaste treatment, storage, and disposal facility under RCRA which may dischargestorm water to the system as well as all facilities which discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity into a large or medium municipalseparate storm sewer system.Requiring these source identification measures is supported by the legislativehistory of section 405 of the WQA, which instructs that ``[i]n writingany permit for a municipal separate storm sewer, EPA or the State shouldpay particular attention to the nature and uses of the drainage area andthe location of <T3>any </T3>industrial facility, open dump, landfill, or hazardous wastetreatment, storage, or disposal facility which may contribute pollutantsto the discharge.'' (emphasis added) (Vol 133 Cong. Rec. S752 (daily ed.Jan. 14, 1987)).EPA is requesting comment on the appropriate elements and level of detailof the source identification process. Comments should address the adequacyof the proposed requirements for preparing initial estimates of pollutantloads and for estimating the concentration of pollutants in dischargesfrom the municipal system based on the minimum source identification requirementin Part 1 of the application and for developing appropriate backgroundinformation or developing storm water management plans.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Characterization of Discharges</ITAG>The characterization plan proposed in today's notice is comprised of severalmajor components:andbullet; A screening analysis to provide information to develop a programfor detecting and controlling illicit connections and illegal dumping tothe municipal separate storm sewer system;andbullet; Initial quantitative data to allow the development of a representativesampling program to be incorporated as permit conditions;andbullet; System-wide estimates of annual pollutant loadings and the meanconcentration of pollutants in discharges resulting from a representativestorm and a program to, during the life of the permit, provide estimatesfor each major outfall of the seasonal pollutant loadings and the eventmean concentration of pollutants in discharges resulting from a representativestorm; andandbullet; An identification of receiving waters with known water qualityimpacts associated with storm water discharges.<T3>a. Screening Analysis for Illicit Discharges. </T3>Illicit discharges(non-storm water discharges without a NPDES permit) and illegal dumpingto municipal separate storm sewer systems occur in a relatively haphazardmanner. Due to the unpredictability of such discharges, a field analysisis necessary for the developing priorities for detecting and controllingsuch discharges. As discussed in greater detail in andSection;VII.G.7.b oftoday's notice, EPA is proposing to require that municipal applicants submita comprehensive plan to develop a program to detect and control illicitconnections and illegal dumping. In order to develop appropriate prioritiesfor these programs, EPA is proposing that applicants submit the resultsof a two-phased screening analysis to be performed on known major outfallsin the systems to detect the presence of illicit hookups and illegal dumping.The results of the first phase of the screening analysis, referred to asthe field screen, would be reported in Part 1 of the permit application.The information received from the field screen would be used to developrequirements for the second phase of the screening analysis, the resultsof which would be reported in Part 2 of the application.Under the proposed requirements for a field screen, the applicant or co-applicantswould submit a description of observations of dry weather discharges forall known major outfalls in Part 1 of the application. At a minimum, thefield screen would include a description of visual observations made duringa dry weather period. If any flow is observed during a dry weather period,two grab samples would be collected during a 24 hour period with a minimumperiod of four hours between samples. For all such samples, a descriptionof the color, odor, turbidity, the presence of an oil sheen or surfacescum as well as any other relevant observation regarding the potentialpresence of non-storm water discharges or illegal dumping would be provided.In addition, the results of a field screen using on-site methods to estimatepH, total chlorine, total copper, total phenol, total and hexavalant chromium,detergents (or surfactants) and free cyanide would be provided along withan estimate of the flow rate. EPA does not intend to require that analyticalmethods approved under 40 CFR Part 136 be used exclusively in the fieldscreen. Rather, the use of inexpensive field sampling techniques such asthe use of colormetric detection methods is anticipated. Where the fieldscreen does not involve analytical methods approved under 40 CFR Part 136,the applicant would be required to provide a description of the methodused which includes the name of the manufacturer of the test method, includingthe range and accuracy of the test. EPA is requesting comments on appropriatefield techniques for a field screen of dry weather discharges. EPA alsorequests comments on requiring the field screen for all major outfalls,whether the proposed definition of major outfalls is appropriate for thispurpose, or whether the number of major outfalls subject to the field screenin the Part 1 application should be limited.It should be clarified that data from the field screen would generallynot be appropriate for comprehensive evaluation of water quality impacts,or estimating pollutant loadings. Rather the Director will use the informationfrom the field screen in Part 1 of the application, along with other information,such as the age of development and degree of industrial activity in thedrainage basin, to identify major outfalls which are appropriate for studyduring the second phase of the screening analysis.The Second phase of the screening analysis requires that wet-weather anddry-weather samples be collected and analyzed in accordance with analyticalmethods approved under 40 CFR 136 from designated major outfalls for thefollowing pollutants:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp9,p0,8/9,i1,xls84,r59 </C><T4>Table M-1</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">pH<D>lead.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">fecal coliform<D>copper.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">fecal streptococcus<D>chromium.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">volatile organic carbon (VOC)<D>cadmium.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">surfactants (MBAS)<D>silver.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">oil and grease<D>nickel.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">TSS<D>zinc.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">total organic carbon (TOC)<D>cyanides.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">biological oxygen demand (BOD<T2>5</T2>) <D>total phenol.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">chemical oxygen demand (COD)<D>total chlorine.</D></ITAG></ITAG>These pollutants have been selected as indicators of illegal dumping andillicit connections of process and nonprocess waste waters as well as sanitarywastewaters. Fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus and chlorine were selectedas indicators of municipal sanitary wastewater discharges. Oil and grease,surfactants (MBAS), pH, TSS COD BOD<T2>5</T2>, and TOC were selected as indicators of illicit connectionsfrom commercial and industrial operations. VOC, TOC and total phenol wereselected as indicators of illicit connections from facilities that dischargewastewaters contaminated by solvents and other organic materials. The metalsselected are metals for which EPA has developed effluent guidelines forindustires which are generally expected to be located in an urban setting.EPA requests comments on the use of these parameters for performing a fieldscreen to detect discharges containing illicit connections, particularlythe use of fecal coliform and fecal streptococcus (see 41<T3>FR</T3> 8013 (March 7, 1986)). The Agency also requests comment onthe usefulness of additional parameters for use in a field screen. In addition,the Agency requests comment on alternative procedures, such as inspectionsof separate storm sewers that are suspected to contain illicit connections,that can be relied on in lieu of the field screen procedures proposed asPart 2 application requirements. Also, the Agency requests comments onincorporating a maximum limit on the number of major outfalls that wouldbe subject to field screen procedures of the Part 2 application requirementsand what an appropriate limit may be. Under this approach, where informationin the Part 1 field screen indicated a high potential for extensive illicitconnections within the system, the field sceen requirements of the Part2 application would be limited to a specified number of major outfalls(for example, 50 major outfalls for large systems, and 25 major outfallsfor medium systems). In this case, premit conditions would be developedfor studying, during the term of the permit, other major outfall with ahigh potential for illicit connections. b. Representative data. The NURP study showed that pollutant concentrationsin urban runoff can exhibit significant variation. Pollutant concentrationsin such discharges vary during storm events and from storm event to stormevent. Given the complex, variable nature of storm water discharges frommunicipal systems, EPA favors a permit scheme where the collection of representativedata is primarily a task that will be accomplished through monitoring programsduring the term of the permit. Permit writers have the necessary flexibilityto develop monitoring requirements that more accurately reflect the truenature of highly variable, complex discharges.In today's notice, EPA is proposing a strategy for performing an initialassessment of water quality impacts of discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers based primarily on source identification measures and existinginformation received in the permit application. This information will beused to characterize system discharges. The analysis developed under thisapproach will incorporate existing data bases such as the one developedunder the NURP study. Under today's proposal, some quantitative data willbe collected to ensure the system discharges can be appropriately representedby the various existing data bases and to provide a basis for developinga monitoring plan to be implemented as a permit condition.EPA is proposing that quantitative data be submitted for representativestorm events for between five and ten outfalls. The municipality will recommendand the Director will then designate the outfalls as representative ofthe commercial, residential and industrial land use activities of the drainagearea contributing to the system, on the basis of information received inPart 1 of the application. The applicant will be required to collect samplesof a storm discharge from a representative storm event for each outfalldesignated. In addition, for at least one outfall designated by the Director,the applicant will be required to collect samples of storm water dischargesfrom three representative storm events that occur at least one month apart.This requirement will be modified by the Director if the type and frequencyof storm events require different sampling. For example, the Director mayrequire samples of discharges be collected during snow melts, or duringspecified seasons. The Director may also require additional testing duringa single event if it is unlikely that there will be three storm eventssuitable for sampling during the year. All samples collected will be analyzed for all pollutants listed in TableII (organic pollutants except bis (chlormethyl) ether, dichlorofluoromethaneand trichlorofluoromethane) and Table III (toxic metals, cyanide and totalphenol) of Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 122, and for:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp9,p0,8/9,i1,xls84,r25</C><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">total suspended solids (TSS)<D>dissolved solids.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">COD<D> BOD</D><T2>5</T2>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">oil and grease<D>fecal coliform.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">fecal streptococcus <D>pH.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">total nitrogen<D>dissolved phosphorus.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">total ammonia plus organic nitrogen <D>total phosphorus.</D></ITAG></ITAG><T4>Table M-</T4>2A portion of the NURP program involved monitoring 120 priority pollutantsin storm water discharges from lands used for residential, commercial andlight industrial activities. The NURP program excluded testing for asbestosand dioxin. Results for seven other organic priority pollutants were notconsidered valid due to changes in, or constraints on test methods. Seventy-sevenpriority pollutants were detected in samples of storm water dischargesfrom lands used for residential, commercial and light industries takenduring the NURP study, including 14 inorganic and 63 organic pollutants.Table M-3 shows the priority pollutants which were detected in at leastten percent of the discharge samples which were sampled for priority pollutants.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,6</C><T4>Table M-3._Priority Pollutants Detected in at Least 10% of NURP Samples</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Frequency of detection (percent)</H1> Metals and Inorganics:  <ITAG tagnum="2">Antimony <D>13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Arsenic <D>52 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Beryllium <D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cadmium <D>48 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chromium <D>58 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Copper <D>91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cyanides <D>23 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lead <D>94 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nickel <D>43 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Selenium <D>11 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Zinc <D>94 </D></ITAG>Pesticides: <ITAG tagnum="2">Alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane <D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Alpha-endosulfan <D>19 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chlordane <D>17 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lindane <D>15 </D></ITAG>Halogenated Aliphatics: <ITAG tagnum="2">Methane, dichloro- <D>11 </D></ITAG>Phenols and Cresols: <ITAG tagnum="2">Phenol <D>14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Phenol, pentachloro- <D>19 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Phenol, 4-nitro <D>10 </D></ITAG>Phthalate Esters: <ITAG tagnum="2">Phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) <D>22 </D></ITAG>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: <ITAG tagnum="2">Chrysene <D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fluoranthene <D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Phenanthrene <D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Pyrene <D>15</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The NURP data also showed a significant number of these samples exceededvarious freshwater water quality criteria. The exceedence of water qualitycriteria does not necessarily imply that an actual violation of standardswill exist in the receiving water body in question. Rather, the enumerationof exceedences serves as a screening function to identify those constituentswhose presence in urban storm water runoff may warrant high priority forfurther evaluation. Members of this group represented all of the major organic chemical fractionsfound in Table II of Appendix D of Part 122 (volatiles, acid compounds,base/neutrals, pesticides). EPA favors requiring testing for all organicconstituents in Table II (except bis (chlormethyl) ether, dichlorofluoromethaneand trichlorofluoromethane which have been suspended from the list of organictoxic pollutants in the NPDES regulations (see 46 FR 2266, (January 8,1981), and 46 FR 10723, (February 4, 1981)) rather than limiting the samplingrequirements to the 24 toxic constituents found in the NURP study becausethey will provide a better description of the discharge at essentiallythe same cost. The NURP study focused on characterizing storm water dischargesfrom lands used for residential, commercial and light industrial activities,and in general, did not focus on other sources of pollutants to municipalseparate storm sewer systems, and therefore, does not reflect all potentialpollutants that may be present in discharges from municipal separate stormsewer systems. EPA is requesting comment on appropriate sampling requirements for dischargesfrom large and medium municipal separate storm sewer systems and to whatextent such requirements should be included in permit applications or developedas site-specific permit conditions. The option favored in today's proposalincludes sampling requirements to provide screening data for developinga more intensive program to detect illicit connections and illegal dumping.The sampling requirements proposed for the permit application address alimited number of outfalls and storm events, but require analysis of awide range of pollutants. Sampling for a wide range of pollutants as apermit application requirement may provide permit writers with appropriatedata to target more specific pollutants when developing requirements fora monitoring program established as a permit condition. In addition, thefavored option requires limited sampling of representative outfalls. Thefavored option does not require applicants to submit quantitative datafor storm water discharges associated with industrial activity as partof the permit application but instead requires applicants to submit a proposedprogram to monitor and control such discharges to the municipal system(see andSection; VII.E.7.C).EPA is working with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to evaluatethe availability of USGS technical assistance to municipalities throughcooperative funding programs to aid in collecting representative quantitativedata of storm water discharges from municipal systems.USGS data collection programs with municipalities typically include stormwater discharge samples obtained at various times during a storm hydrographevent. Various USGS filed procedures can be used to obtain discharge datafor pipes, culverts, etc. typically found in urban areas. Pollutant modelscan be calibrated with data and long-term rainfall records to simulatethe quality of system discharges and compared to other storm water models.In addition, the Agency recognizes that many municipalities have participatedin studies, such as NURP, that involve sampling of urban runoff as wellas other components of discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems.All existing storm water sampling data along with relevant water qualitydata, sediment data, fish tissue data or biosurvey data, taken over thelast ten years is considered relevant and under today's proposal must besubmitted with Part 1 of the application. Sampling data that is submittedmust be accompanied with a narrative description of the drainage area servedby the outfall monitored, a description of the sampling and quality controlprogram, and the location of receiving water monitoring.EPA requests comment on the use of existing data, such as that generatedunder the NURP study, to satisfy the requirement of providing representativesampling data. The Agency is concerned with establishing criteria thatcan be used to verify the validity of existing data.<T3>c. Loading and Concentration Estimates.</T3> The assessment of thewater quality impacts of discharges from municipal separate storm sewersystems on receiving waters requires the analysis of both pollutant loadingsand concentrations of pollutants in discharges.The loading and concentration estimates proposed in today's notice willbe used to evaluate two types of water quality impacts: (1) Short-termimpacts; and (2) long-term impacts.Short term impacts from discharges from municipal separate storm sewersinvolve changes in water quality that occur during and shortly after stormevents. Examples of short term impacts that can lead to impairments includeperiodic dissolved oxygen depression due to the oxidation of contaminants,high bacteria levels, fish kills, acute effects of toxic pollutants, contactrecreation impairments and loss of submerged macrophytes. Characterizationof instream pollutant concentrations based on estimated pollutant concentrationin system discharges are important for evaluating these types of impacts.Long-term water quality impacts from discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers may be caused by contaminants associated with suspended solidsthat settle in receiving water sediments and by nutrients which enter receivingwater systems with long retention times. Pollutant loading data are importantfor evaluation of impairments such as loss of storage capacity in streams,estuaries, reservoirs, lakes and bays, lake eutrophication caused by highnutrient loading, and destruction of benthic habitat. Other examples ofthe long-term water quality impacts include depressed dissolved oxygencaused by the oxidation of organics in bottom sediments and biologicalaccumulation of toxics as a result of up-take by organisms in the foodchain. An estimate of annual pollutant loading associated with dischargesfrom municipal storm water sewer systems is necessary to evaluate the magnitudeand severity of the environmental impacts of such discharges and to evaluatethe effectiveness of controls which are imposed at a later time.Municipal storm water sewer systems generally handle runoff from largedrainage areas and the sources of pollution are usually very diffuse. Theconcentrations of many pollutants in discharges from these systems areoften low relative to many industrial process and Publicly Owned TreatmentWorks discharges. The water quality impacts of low concentration pollutiondischarges tend to be cumulative and need to be evaluated in terms of aggregateloadings as well as pollutant concentrations. A site-specific loading analysiscan be used to evaluate the relative contribution of various pollutantsources.Physical impacts, such as streambed scour, streambank erosion and low streamflow during dry weather can be caused by urban runoff. Today's proposedregulations do not specifically require that the physical impacts of urbanrunoff be addressed in the permit application. Although NPDES permits inmany jurisdictions may contain controls designed to limit these physicalimpacts, EPA believes that the most appropriate Federal policy is to encouragejurisdiction-specific decisions regarding the appropriateness of controlsdesigned to lessen the physical impacts of urban runoff.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Proposed Storm Water Quality Management Programs</ITAG>Traditionally, NPDES permits for industrial process waste discharges andfor municipal sanitary sewers have relied primarily on end-of-pipe treatmenttechnology. The basic approach for these discharges under the CWA, theapplication of uniform technology-based controls to classes of discharges,is often not appropriate for municipal separate storm sewer discharges.Instead, flexible site-specific and source-specific decisions on managementcontrols are often appropriate.A wide variety of control measures to reduce the discharge of pollutantsfrom municipal storm sewer systems are currently available The performanceof appropriate control measures is highly dependent on site-specific factors.It is therefore not practicable to define one standard set of controlswhich will control all pollutants in all municipalities.In today's notice, EPA is proposing to facilitate the development of site-specificpermit conditions by requiring permit applicants to submit, along withother information, a description of existing structural and non-structuralcontrol measures on discharges of pollutants from municipal storm sewersin Part 1 of the permit application. Proposed andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)requires the applicant to identify in Part 2 of the application, to thedegree necessary to meet the MEP standard, additional control measureswhich will be implemented during the life of the permit. Although, in manycases, it will not be possible to identify all control measures that areappropriate as permit conditions, EPA believes that the process of identifyingcomponents of a comprehensive control program should begin early and thatapplicants should be given the opportunity to identify and propose thecomponents of the program that they believe are appropriate for controllingdischarges of pollutants.The permit application requirements in today's notice require the applicantor co-applicant to develop management programs for four types of pollutantsources which discharge to large and medium municipal storm sewer systems.Discharges from large and medium municipal storm sewer systems are usuallyexpected to be composed primarily of (1) runoff from commercial and residentialareas, (2) storm water runoff from industrial areas, (3) runoff from constructionsites, and (4) non-storm water discharges. Part 2 of the proposed permitapplication has been designed to allow the applicant the opportunity topropose MEP control measures for each of these components of the discharge.Discharges from some municipal systems may also contain pollutants fromother sources, such as runoff from land disposal activities (leaking septictanks, landfills and land application of sewage sludge). Where other sources,such as land disposal, contribute significant amounts of pollutants toa municipal storm sewer system, appropriate control measures should beincluded on a site specific basis. Proposed management programs will thenbe evaluated in the development of permit conditions.There is some overlap in the manner in which these pollutant sources areclassified. Also, some control measures will reduce pollutant loads formultiple components of the municipal storm sewer discharge. These measuresshould be identified under all appropriate places in the application; asdiscussed below however, double counting of pollutant removal must be avoidedwhen the total assessment of control measures is performed.Although many land use programs involve multiple purposes which includemeasures to reduce pollutants in discharges from municipal separate stormsewer systems, the proposed management program in today's notice is intendedto address only those controls which can be implemented by the permit applicantor co-applicants. The Agency cannot abrogate its responsibilities underthe CWA to implement the NPDES permit program by relying on pollution controlprograms that are outside the NPDES program.The Agency anticipates that storm water management programs will evolveand mature over time. The permits for discharges from municipal separatestorm sewer systems will be written to reflect changing conditions thatresult from program development and implementation and corresponding improvementsin water quality. The proposed permit applications will require applicantsto provide a description of the range of control measures considered forimplementation during the term of the permit. Flexibility in developingpermit conditions will be encouraged by providing applicants an opportunityto identify in the permit application priority controls appropriate forthe initial implementation of management programs. Applicants will proposepriorities based on a consideration of appropriate controls including,but not limited to, consideration of controls that address reducing pollutantsto municipal separate storm sewer system discharges that are associatedwith storm water from commercial and residential areas (andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A)),illicit discharges and illegal disposal (andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(B)),storm water from industrial areas (andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(C)), andrunoff from construction sites (andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(D)). Permitsfor different municipalities will place different emphasis on controllingvarious components of discharges from municipal storm sewers. For example,the potential for cross-connections (such as municipal sewage or industrialprocess wastewater discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer) is generallyexpected to be greater in municipalities with older developed areas. Onthe other hand, municipalities with larger areas of new development willhave a greater opportunity to focus controls to reduce pollutants in stormwater generated by the area after it is developed, discharges from constructionsites, and other planning activities. EPA requests comments on the processand methods for developing appropriate priorities in management programsproposed in applications and how the development of these priorities canbe coordinated with controls on other discharges to ensure the achievementof water quality standards and the goals of the Clean Water Act. In addition,the Agency requests comments on the costs of implementing various componentsof management programs.The Agency requests comments on the appropriateness of the individual componentsof the proposed management programs and whether additional provisions shouldbe added. Comments on various components of the management programs shouldaddress the cost of program development and implementation as well as thepotential for pollutant removal and water quality benefits.In addition, the Agency will continue to evaluate procedures and methodsto control storm water discharges to the extent necessary to mitigate impactson water quality in the studies required under Section 402(p)(5) of theCWA (see section IV of today's notice). One purpose of these studies willbe to evaluate the costs and water quality benefits associated with implementingthese procedures and methods. This evaluation will address a number offactors which impact the implementation costs associated with these programs,such as the extent to which similar municipal ordinances are currentlybeing implemented, the degree to which existing municipal programs (suchas flood management programs or construction site inspections) can be expandedto address water quality concerns, the resource intensiveness of the control,and whether the control program will involve public or private expenditures.This information, along with information gained during permit implementationwill aid in the dynamic long-term development of municipal storm watermanagement programs. EPA invites the public to submit information thatcan be used in the development of these studies.<T3>a. Measures to Reduce Pollutants in Runoff from Commercial and ResidentialAreas.</T3> The NURP program evaluated runoff from lands primarily dedicatedto residential and commercial activities. The areas evaluated in the studyreflect some other activities, such as light industry, which are commonlydispersed among residential and commercial areas. The NURP study selectedsampling locations that were thought to be relatively free of illicit dischargesand storm water from heavy industrial sites including storm water runofffrom heavy construction sites. Of course, in a study such as NURP, it wasimpossible to totally isolate various contributions to the runoff. In developingthe proposed permit application requirements in today's notice, EPA has,in general, relied on the NURP definition of urban runoff, that is, runofffrom lands used for residential, commercial and light industrial activities.NURP and numerous other studies have shown the runoff from residentialand commercial areas washes a number of pollutants into receiving waters.Of equal importance is the volume of storm water runoff leaving urban areasduring storm events. Large intermittent volumes of runoff can destroy aquatichabitat.As the percentage of paved surfaces increases, the volume and rate of runoffand the corresponding pollutant loads also increase. Thus, the amount ofstorm water from commercial and residential areas and the pollutant loadingsassociated with storm water runoff increases as development progressesand remains at an elevated level for the lifetime of the development.Proposed andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A) requires municipal storm sewer systemapplicants to provide in Part 2 of the application a description of a proposedmanagement program that will describe priorities for implementing managementprograms based on a consideration of appropriate controls including:andbullet; A description of maintenance activities and a maintenance schedulefor structural controls;andbullet; A description of planning procedures including a comprehensivemaster plan to control after construction is completed, the discharge ofpollutants from municipal separate storm sewers which receive dischargesfrom new development and significant redevelopment after construction iscompleted;andbullet; A description of practices for operating and maintaining publichighways and procedures for reducing the impact on receiving waters ofsuch discharges from municipal storm sewer system;andbullet; A description of procedures to assure that flood management projectsassess the impacts on the water quality of receiving water bodies; andandbullet; A description of a program to reduce to the maximum extent practicable,pollutants in discharges from municipal separate storm sewers associatedwith the application of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer which willinclude, as appropriate, controls such as educational activities and othermeasures for commercial applicators and distributors, and controls forapplication in public right-of-ways and at municipal facilities.Water quality problems caused by municipal storm sewer discharges willgenerally be most acute in heavily developed areas. Usually, the most effectivecontrol measures are structural, and opportunities for implementing thesemeasures may be limited in previously developed areas. Commonly used structuraltechnologies include a wide variety of treatment techniques, includingfirst flush diversion systems, detention/infiltration basins, retentionbasins, extended detention basins, infiltration trenches, porous pavement,oil/grit separators, grass swales, and swirl concentrators. A major problemassociated with sound storm water management is the need for operatingand maintaining the systems for their expected life.The unavailability of land in highly developed areas often makes the useof structural controls infeasible for modifying many existing systems.Non-structural practices can play a more important role. Non-structuralpractices can include erosion control, streambank management techniques,street cleaning operations, vegetation/lawn maintenance controls, debrisremoval, road salt application management and public awareness programs.The second component of the proposed program to reduce pollutants in stormwater from commercial and residential areas which discharge to municipalstorm sewer systems provides that applicants describe the planning proceduresand a comprehensive master plan that will assure that increases of pollutantloading associated with newly developed areas are, to the maximum extentpracticable, limited. These measures should address storm water from commercialand residential areas which discharge to the municipal storm sewer thatoccur after the construction phase of development is completed. Controlsfor construction activities are addressed later in today's notice.As urban development occurs, the volume of storm water and its rate ofdischarge increases. These increases are caused when pavement and structurescover soils and destroy vegetation which otherwise would slow and absorbrunoff. Development also accelerates erosion through alteration of theland surface. Areas that are in the process of development offer the greatestpotential for utilizing the full range of structural and non-structuralbest management practices. If these measures are to provide controls toreduce pollutant discharges after the area has been developed, comprehensiveplanning must be used to incorporate these measures as the area is in theprocess of developing. These measures offer an important opportunity tolimit increases in pollutant loads.The third component of andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A) provides a descriptionof practices for operating and maintaining public roads and highways andprocedures for reducing the impact on receiving waters of discharges frommunicipal storm sewer systems. General guidelines recommended for managinghighway storm water runoff include litter control, pesticide/herbicideuse management, reducing direct discharges, reducing runoff velocity, grassedchannels, curb elimination, catchbasin maintenance, appropriate streetcleaning,establishing and maintaining vegetation, development of management controlsfor salt storage facilities, education and calibration practices for deicingapplication, infiltration practices, and detention/retention practices.The fourth component of andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A) provides that applicantsidentify procedures that enable flood management agencies to consider theimpact of flood management projects on the water quality of receiving streams.A well-developed storm water management program can reduce the amount ofpollutants in storm water discharges as well as benefit flood control objectives.As discussed above, increased development can increase both the quantityof runoff from commercial and residential areas and the pollutant loadassociated with such discharges. Disturbing the land cover, altering naturaldrainage patterns, and increasing impervious area all increase the quantityand rate of runoff, thereby increasing both erosion and flooding potential.Increases in the quantity of runoff can result in increasing the area ofa flood plain. An integrated planning approach helps planners make thebest decisions to benefit both flood control and water quality objectives.The fifth component of andSection; 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(A) would provide thatmunicipal applicants submit a description of a program to reduce to themaximum extent practicable, pollutants in discharges from municipal separatestorm sewers associated with the application of pesticides, herbicidesand fertilizer. Such a program may include, as appropriate, controls suchas educational activities and other measures for commercial applicatorsand distributors, and controls for application in public right-of-waysand at municipal facilities. Discharges of these materials to municipalstorm sewer systems can be controlled by proper application of these materials.<T3>b. Measures for Illicit Discharges and Improper Disposal. </T3>TheWQA requires that NPDES permits for discharges from municipal storm sewers``shall include a requirement to effectively prohibit non-stormwater dischargesinto the storm sewers.'' In today's proposal, EPA will begin to implementthis statutory mandate by focusing on two types of discharges to largeand medium municipal separate storm sewer systems. One type of non-stormwater discharges are illicit discharges which are plumbed into the systemor that result from leakage of sanitary sewage system. The other classof non-storm water discharges result from the improper disposal of materialssuch as used oil and other toxic materials.Illicit DischargesIn some municipalities, illicit connections of sanitary, commercial andindustrial discharges to storm sewer systems have had a significant impacton the water quality of receiving waters. Although the NURP study did notemphasize identifying illicit connections to storm sewers other than toassure that monitoring sites used in the study were free from sanitarysewage contamination, the study concluded that illicit connections canresult in high bacterial counts and dangers to public health. The studyalso noted that removing such discharges presented opportunities for dramaticimprovements in the quality of urban storm water discharges.Other studies have shown that illicit connections to storm sewers can createsevere, wide-spread contamination problems. For example, the Huron RiverPollution Abatement Program inspected 660 businesses, homes and other buildingslocated in Washtenaw County, Michigan and identified 14% of the buildingsas having improper storm drain connections. Illicit discharges were detectedat a higher rate of 60% for automobile related businesses, including servicestations, automobile dealerships, car washes, body shops and light industrialfacilities. While some of the problems discovered in this study were theresult of improper plumbing or illegal connections, a majority were approvedconnections at the time they were built.A wide variety of technologies exist for detecting illicit discharges.The effectiveness of these measures largely depends upon the site-specificdesign of the system. Under today's proposal, permit applicants would developa description of a proposed management program, including priorities forimplementing the program and a schedule to implement a program to identifyillicit discharges to the municipal storm sewer system. The proposed programwill identify initial priorities for analyzing various portions of thesystem and the appropriate detection techniques to be used.Improper disposalThe permit application requirements proposed today for municipal stormsewer systems include a requirement that the municipal permit applicantdescribe a program to assist and facilitate in the proper management ofused oil and toxic materials.Improper management of used oil can lead to discharges to municipal stormsewers that in turn may have a significant impact on receiving water bodies.EPA estimates that annually, 267 million gallons of used oil, including135 million gallons of used oil from do-it-yourself (DIY) automobile oilchanges, are disposed improperly. An additional 70 million gallons of usedoil, most coming from service stations and repair shops, are used for roadoiling. Most of this oil contains metals, such as lead and chromium, atsuch high levels that the Agency proposed to list used oil as a hazardouswaste (November 29, 1985, (50 <T3>FR</T3> 49258)). This proposal was not made final because the Agencythought that a hazardous waste listing of all used oil may discourage recycling.The Agency is presently considering listing used oil that is not recycledas a hazardous waste (March 10, 1986, (51 <T3>FR</T3> 8206), and November 19, 1986 (51 <T3>FR</T3> 41900). However, even if these rules are promulgated, due tovarious exclusions many individuals and facilities that generate or handleused oil are not regulated under RCRA.Although EPA is developing a regulatory program under RCRA for the managementof recycled oil, the RCRA regulations will likely only apply to certainfacilities that will be classified as used oil marketers and used oil recyclers.DIY oil changers and certain other facilities are generally not subjectto regulation under the RCRA program. A recent EPA report, ``Revised BaselineFlow Data for Used Oil Modelling'' (March 13, 1987) suggests that a largefraction of service stations no longer accept DIY used oil and that asa result DIYs are having increasing difficulty recycling oil, thereby leadingto increases in uncontrolled disposal.EPA is proposing that permit applicants for large and medium municipalstorm sewer systems describe a program to facilitate the proper managementof used oil. EPA requests comments on when various components of this programmay be appropriate, including providing information to handlers of usedoil and DIY generators and household toxic waste generators, adopting appropriatecontrols on road oiling, and establishing and operating oil and householdwaste recycling/disposal programs.<T3>c. Measures to Reduce Pollutants in Storm Water Discharges Associatedwith Industrial Activities Into Municipal Systems. </T3>As discussed inandSection;VII.B of today's notice, industrial facilities that dischargestorm water to a large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systemare not required to obtain an individual permit for such discharges unlessthe Director requires the facility to obtain a permit or to become a co-permittee.EPA is proposing to require the municipal storm sewer permittee to describecontrol programs for such discharges that are covered under the municipalstorm sewer permit. At a minimum, the program would require the municipalapplicant to identify such discharges (see source identification requirementsat andSection;122.26(d)(1)(vi)(C)), provide for monitoring certain dischargesand where necessary, implement control measures. Should a municipalitysuspect that an individual discharger into the system is causing a problem,and the municipality or management agency has no authority over the discharge,the municipality should contact the NPDES permitting authority and requestthat an individual permit be issued, or at a minimum, request that sucha discharge be designated a co-permittee.Although the Agency has not proposed specific regulatory language, EPAis requesting comment on two groups of options for programs to characterizestorm water discharges associated with industrial activity that go to municipalseparate storm sewers. Under the first group of options, municipal applicantswould describe the development of a program to characterize dischargesfrom certain outfalls from the municipal storm sewer system that containrunoff from industrial facilities. Under these options, the municipal applicantwould submit a proposed characterization program as part of the permitapplication. Quantitative data collected under an approved monitoring programwould be submitted during the life of the permit and would be used to developa comprehensive control program. Under the second group of options, certainindustrial facilities would be responsible for characterizing storm waterdischarges into large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systems.Under the first group of options, several issues arise in the developmentof an appropriate characterization program for municipal systems. The firstissue is identifying which storm water discharges from industrial facilitiesinto municipal systems should be monitored. One approach would be to requiredata on portions of the municipal system which receives storm water fromfacilities which are listed in the proposed regulatory definition at andSection;122.26(b)(13)of ``storm water discharge associated with industrial activity'' (withthe exception of construction activities and uncontaminated storm waterfrom oil and gas operations) which discharge into the municipal system.However, given the potentially large number of facilities that meet thisdefinition and would discharge into municipal systems, a monitoring programthat requires the submission of quantitative data regarding portions ofthe municipal systems receiving storm water from such facilities may notbe practicable. Such a requirement could, for some systems, potentiallybecome the most resource intensive requirements in the municipal permit.Therefore, EPA is considering various ways to develop appropriate targetingfor monitoring programs.EPA requests comments on a requirement that, at a minimum, monitoring programsaddress discharges from municipal separate storm sewer outfalls that containstorm water discharges from municipal landfills, hazardous waste treatment,disposal and recovery facilities, and runoff from industrial facilitiesthat are subject to Section 313 of Title III of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). Section 313 of Title III requiresthat operators or certain facilities that manufacture, import, process,or otherwise use certain toxic chemicals report annually their releasesof those chemicals to any environmental media. Section 313(b) of TitleIII specifies that a facility is covered for purposes of reporting if itmeets all of the following criteria:andbullet; The facility has ten or more full-time employees;andbullet; The facility is in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes20 through 39;andbullet; The facility manufactured (including quantities imported), processed,or otherwise used a listed chemical in amounts that exceed certain thresholdquantities during the calendar year for which reporting is required.Listed chemicals include 329 toxic chemicals listed at 40 CFR 372.45. After1989, the threshold quantities of listed chemicals that the facility mustmanufacture, import or process in order to be required to submit a releasereport is 25,000 pounds per year. The threshold for a use other than manufacturing,importing or processing of listed toxic chemicals is 10,000 pounds peryear. EPA promulgated a final regulation clarifying these reporting requirementson February 16, 1988 (53 FR 4500). EPA requests comments on whether Section 313 of SARA identifies facilitieswhich provide an appropriate basis for establishing priorities for municipalpermittees to develop monitoring and control programs for storm water associatedwith industrial activity. Several advantages are associated with this approach.First, the potential for toxic materials in discharges from these facilitiesis relatively high due to the large volume of hazardous substances locatedat these facilities. Second, some information regarding storm water dischargesand material management at these facilities will be available through theSection 313 of SARA reporting process. The Agency requests comments on monitoring programs for municipal discharges,including the submission of quantitative data on the following constituents:andbullet; Any pollutant limited in an effluent guideline for the industrysubcategory, where applicable; andbullet; Any pollutant listed in the facility's NPDES permit for its processwastewater, if it has one;andbullet; Oil and grease, COD, pH, BOD<T2>5</T2>, TOC, TSS, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and andbullet; Any information on the discharge required under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(7)(iii) and (iv). These are the same constituents that EPA is proposing to require individualpermit applicants for storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity to provide quantitative data. A third issue concerning appropriate monitoring programs for runoff fromindustrial facilities discharging to municipal systems involves the samplinglocation. Several commenters on earlier storm water proposals assertedthat all pollutants discharged to waters of the United States via stormwater runoff may not be of concern due to the dilution factor at a specificlocation. The Agency initially favors establishing monitoring requirementsto be applied to those outfalls that directly discharge to waters of theUnited States. Monitoring of outfalls close to the point of discharge towaters of the United States is generally preferable when attempting toidentify priorities for developing pollutant control programs. However,under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to monitor at the pointwhere the runoff from the industrial facility discharges to the municipalsystem. For example, if many facilities discharge substantially similarstorm water to a municipal system (e.g., storm water discharges from generalautomotive repair shops) it may be more practicable to monitor dischargesfrom representative facilities in order to characterize pollutants in thedischarge. Under the second group of options considered under today's notice, allindustrial facilities which discharge storm water into a large or mediummunicipal storm sewer system would submit information to either the Directorof the NPDES program (the EPA or States with approved NPDES programs) orthe municipal permit applicant for the municipal storm sewer that receivesthe discharge. The information that the facility would submit to the permitapplicant would be the same information that would be required in an individualpermit application for a facility that discharges storm water associatedwith industrial activity directly to waters of the United States. For example,of facilities that discharge storm water to municipal storm sewer systems,only municipal landfills, hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposalfacilities and those facilities subject to Section 313 of Title III ofSARA would be required to submit a permit application. Facilities thatdischarge storm water to a municipal storm sewer would have the optionof participating in a group application in lieu of submitting informationdirectly to the municipal applicant. These members of the group applicationwould be required to indicate in the group application the municipal stormsewer to which they are discharging. EPA would forward a summary of theinformation in the group application to the appropriate municipal applicantsfor use in developing appropriate controls for the member of the groupapplication. EPA is also requesting comment on whether facilities that discharge tolarge and medium municipal storm sewer systems and that are not participatingin a group application should submit individual permit applications toEPA regions or NPDES States. Under this option, the permit applicationswould be used to determine if an individual permit or a co-permittee arrangementis appropriate. Where it is not appropriate to require an individual permitor a co-permittee arrangement, the application would be sent to the appropriatemunicipal permit applicant (under the authority of Section 402(j) of theCWA), who would use the information to develop appropriate controls forthe facility.This option recognizes that the operator of the facility is in the bestposition to know which pollutants may be in the storm water discharge andto provide the non-quantitative information that is required in individualpermit applications. Further, as with facilities discharging storm waterassociated with industrial activity directly to waters of the United States,the facility would be responsible for certifying that it has tested itsstorm water outfalls for illicit connections. By shifting this burden tothe facility discharging storm water associated with industrial activity,the applicant for the municipal storm sewer would be able to concentrateeffort on detecting illicit connections from other types of facilitieswith a high potential for illicit connections.EPA is requesting comment on these approaches to control pollutants instorm water from industrial facilities which discharge to a large or mediummunicipal separate storm sewer system. In particular, should municipalitiesor individual industrial facilities be required to collect sampling data?If high levels of pollutants are detected in samples from a municipal stormwater outfall, and storm water from industrial facilities is a suspectedcontributor, how will municipalities determine which facilities are responsible?Is end-of-pipe treatment generally more appropriate than source controlsfor storm water from industrial facilities which discharge to municipalsystems? If municipalities are responsible for sampling these discharges,are indicator parameters such as VOC more appropriate than the specificconstituents that individuals industrial facilities with storm water dischargeswhich do not discharge to municipal systems are required to sample underindividual storm water permit application requirements?<T3>d. Measures to Reduce Pollutants in Runoff from Construction SitesInto Municipal Systems. </T3>Section VII.D.2 of today's notice discussesEPA's proposal to define the term ``storm water discharge associated withindustrial activity'' to include runoff from construction facilities classifiedas Standard Industrial Codes 15 and 16 (general building contractors andheavy construction contractors) including preconstruction activities, <T3>except: </T3>(a) operations that result in the disturbance of lessthan 1 acre total land area which are not part of a larger common planof development or sale; or (b) that are designed to serve single familyresidential projects, including duplexes, triplexes, or quadruplexes, thatresult in the disturbance of less than 5 acre total land areas which arenot part of a larger common plan of development or sale. Under today'sproposal, facilities that discharge runoff from construction sites thatmeet this definition will be required to submit permit applications undertoday's rulemaking unless they are to be covered by another NPDES permitor discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer (see andSection; VII.C.1).Permit application requirements for such discharges are proposed at 40CFR 122.26(c)(1)(ii).Section 122.26(d)(2)(iv)(D) of the proposed regulations would require applicantsfor a permit for large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systemsto submit a description of a proposed management program to control pollutantsin all construction site runoff that discharges to municipal systems. Underthe proposed provision, municipal applicants will submit a proposed programfor implementing and maintaining structural and non-structural best managementpractices for controlling storm water runoff at construction sites. Theprogram will address procedures for site planning; enforceable requirementsfor nonstructural and structural best management practices; proceduresfor inspecting sites and enforcing control measures; and educational andtraining measures.Generally, construction site ordinances are effective when they are implemented.However, in many areas, even though ordinances exist, they have limitedeffectiveness because they are not adequately implemented. Maintainingbest management practices also presents problems. Retention and infiltrationbasins fill up and silt fences may break or be overtopped. Weak inspectionand enforcement point to the need for more emphasis on training and educationto complement regulatory programs.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Assessment of Controls</ITAG>EPA is proposing that municipal applicants provide an initial assessmentof the effectiveness of the control method for structural or non-structuralcontrols which have been proposed in the management program. Such an assessmentis needed because the performance of appropriate management controls ishighly dependent on site-specific factors. The assessment will be usedin the development of pollutant loading and concentration estimates (seeVII.E.6.C) and the evaluation of water quality benefits associated withimplementing controls. Such assessments do not have to be verified withquantitative data, but can be based on accepted engineering design practices.H. Annual reportsAs discussed earlier in today's notice, EPA is proposing flexible permitapplication requirements to facilitate the development of site-specificprograms to control the discharge of pollutants from large and medium municipalseparate storm sewer systems. Many municipalities are in early stages ofthe complex task of developing a program suitable for controlling pollutantsin discharges under a NPDES permit, while other municipalities have relativelysophisticated programs in place. In order to ensure that such site-specificprograms are developed at the maximum extent practicable rate, EPA is proposingto require permittees of municipal separate storm sewer systems to submitannual status reports which reflect the development of their control programs.The reports will be used by the permitting authority to aid in evaluatingcompliance with permit conditions and where necessary, modify permit conditionsto address changed conditions. EPA requests comments on the appropriatecontent of the annual reports.I. Application DeadlinesThe WQA provided a statutory time frame for implementing the storm waterpermit application requirements. The Act establishes deadlines for EPAto establish permit applications, permit application submittal and permitcompliance.The WQA requires EPA to promulgate permit application requirements forstorm water discharges associated with industrial activity and large municipalseparate storm sewer systems by ``no later than two years'' after the dateof enactment (i.e., no later than February 4, 1989). In conjunction withthis requirement, the Act requires that permit applications for these classesof discharges be submitted within one year after the statutory date bywhich EPA is to promulgate permit application requirements by providingthat such applications ``shall be filed no later than three years'' afterthe date of enactment of the WQA (i.e., no later than February 4, 1990).The WOA also requires EPA to promulgate final regulations governing stormwater permit application requirements for discharges from municipal separatestorm sewer systems serving a population of 100,000 or more but less than250,000 by ``no later than four years'' after enactment (i.e. no laterthan February 4, 1991). Permit applications for medium municipal separatestorm sewer systems ``shall be filed no later than five years'' after thedate of enactment of the WQA (i.e., no later than February 4, 1992). TheWQA did not establish the time period between designation and permit applicationsubmittal for case-by-case designations under section 402(p)(2)(E).Comments on earlier rulemakings involving storm water application deadlineshave indicated that applicants need adequate time to obtain ``representative''storm water samples, at least one full rain year. This is because manydischarges are located in areas where testing during dry seasons or winterwould not be feasible. The intermittent and unpredictable nature of stormwater discharges can result in difficult and time-consuming data gathering.Moreover, some operators have many storm water discharges associated withinindustrial activity which can require considerable time to identify, analyze,and submit applications. This creates a tremendous practical problem forthe extremely high number of unpermitted storm water discharges. The Agency'sand the public's interest in a sound storm water program and the developmentof a useful data base on these sources is best served by establishing anapplication deadline which will allow sufficient time to gather, analyze,and submit meaningful applications. Based on a consideration of these factors,EPA favors proposing that individual permit applications for storm waterdischarges associated with industrial activity which currently are notcovered by a permit and that are required to obtain a permit be submittednot later than one year after the final rule is promulgated.Operators of storm water discharges which are currently covered by a permit,will, of course, not be required to submit a permit application until theirexisting permit expires. Facilities which must reapply for a permit fora storm water discharge prior to the promulgation of a final rule basedon today's proposal are required to submit complete Form 1 and Form 2Capplications. In recognition of the time required to collect storm waterdischarge data, EPA will consider allowing facilities that currently havea NPDES permit for a discharge and which must reapply for permit renewalthe option of applying in accordance with existing Form 1 and Form 2C requirementsin lieu of applying in accordance with the revised application requirementsduring the first year following promulgation of the revised permit applicationrequirements.As discussed in andSection; VII.E.4 and andSection; VII.G.2 of today's notice,EPA favors a two part permit applications for both group applications forsufficiently similar facilities that discharge storm water associated withindustrial activity and for operators of large or medium municipal separatestorm sewer systems. The deadlines for submitting permit applications thatare proposed in today's notice are based on providing adequate time for:applicants to prepare Part 1 of the application, adequate review of Part1 of the application by EPA or, in the case of permit applications forlarge and medium municipal storm sewer systems, approved NPDES States,and preparation of the contents of the Part 2 application. For permit applications for storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity, EPA is proposing that Part 1 of the group application be submittedwithin 120 days from the publication of final permit application regulations.This time is necessary to form groups and for individual members of thegroup to prepare the non-quantitative information required in Part 1 ofthe application. Part 1 of the group application will be submitted to EPAHeadquarters in Washington, DC and approved or disapproved within 60 daysafter being received. Part 2 of the application would then be submittedwithin one year after the Part 1 application is approved.For large municipal separate storm sewer systems (systems serving a populationof more than 250,000), EPA is proposing that Part 1 of the permit applicationsbe submitted within one year of the date of the final rule. The Directorwill approve or disapprove the provisions of the Part 1 permit applicationwithin 90 days after receiving the Part 1 application. The Part 2 portionof the application shall then be submitted within two years of the dateof the final rule.For medium municipal separate storm sewer systems (systems serving a populationof more than 100,000, but less than 250,000), EPA is proposing that permitapplications will be required on November 4, 1990. The Director will approveor disapprove the provisions of the Part 1 permit application within 90days after receiving the Part 1 application. The Part 2 portion of theapplication shall then be submitted no later than February 4, 1992, oneyear after the Part 1 application has been approved.Operators of storm water discharges that are not normally required to obtaina permit, may be required to obtain a permit for their discharge on thebasis of a case-by-case designation by the Administrator or the NPDES State.EPA is proposing that operators of storm water discharges associated withindustrial activity which discharge to municipal separate storm sewersare generally not required to obtain a NPDES permit for their discharge,unless required by the Director on a case-by-case basis. The Administratoror NPDES State may also designate storm water discharges (except agriculturalstorm water discharges) that contribute to a violation of a water qualitystandard or that are significant contributors of pollutants to waters ofthe United States for a permit. Prior to a case-by-case determination thatan individual permit is required for a storm water discharge, the Administratoror NPDES State may require the operator of the discharge to submit a permitapplcation. EPA is proposing at andSection;124.52(c) to require the operatorof designated discharges to submit a permit application within 60 daysof notice, unless permission for a later date is granted. The 60-day deadlineis consistent with the procedures for designating other discharges fora NPDES permit on a case-by-case basis found at andSection;124.52. The 60-daydeadline recognizes that case-by-case designations often require an expeditedresponse, but at the same time, is flexible to allow for case-by-case adjustments.In recognition of the time required to promulgate rational final regulationswhich address the complex issues associated with storm water permit applicationrequirements, the Agency realizes that given the date of this proposal,the agency may not be able to promulgate permit application requirementsby the statutory deadline of February 4, 1989 for storm water dischargesassociated with industrial activities and discharges from large municipalseparate storm sewer systems. Based on an analysis of the comments receivedon today's proposal, the Agency will consider promulgating a final rulespecifying permit application requirements for storm water discharges associatedwith industrial activity prior to the date of promulgation of permit applicationrequirements for large and medium municipal storm sewer systems.EPA requests comments on the relationship between the proposed deadlinesand the proposal for a two part permit application for discharges froma large or medium municipal separate storm sewer system. Specifically,EPA requests comments on an alternative approach to a two part permit applicationwhere only some of the requirements discussed in today's notice (primarilythe Part 1 application requirements) would be established as applicationrequirements and other requirements (primarily the Part 2 application requirements)would be established as permit conditions. Under this approach, applicantswould be required to include plans to submit information with the Part1 application. These plans would be used to develop compliance scheduleswhich would be incorporated as permit conditions. This option is not favoredin today's notice because of the Agency's concerns about the additionalcomplexities associated with the scheme and the additional time that maybe required to develop and implement municipal storm water management programs.J. State Storm Water Management ProgramsToday's notice proposes permit application requirements which apply toonly the following storm water discharges:andbullet; A discharge with respect to which a permit has been issued priorto February 4, 1987;andbullet; A discharge associated with industrial activity;andbullet; A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system servinga population of 250,000 or more;andbullet; A discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system servinga population of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000; orandbullet; A discharge for which the Administrator or NPDES State determinesthat the storm water discharge contributes to a violation of a water qualitystandard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to the waters ofthe United States.The EPA, or NPDES approved States cannot require NPDES permits for otherdischarges composed entirely of storm water prior to October 1, 1992. EPAis required to submit to Congress a report on a study, conducted in consultationwith the States, for the purpose of;andbullet; Identifying those storm water discharges or classes of storm waterdischarges for which permits are not required prior to October 1, 1992;andandbullet; Determining, to the maximum extent practicable, the nature andextent of pollutants in such discharges.Not later than October 1, 1989, EPA, in consultation with the States, isrequired to conduct a study for the purpose of establishing proceduresand methods to control storm water discharges to the extent necessary tomitigate impacts on water quality.These studies are to be used by EPA, in consultation with State and localofficials, to issue regulations which designate additional storm waterdischarges to be regulated to protect water quality and to establish acomprehensive storm water quality regulatory program. Section 402(p)(6)of the CWA requires that the comprehensive regulatory program shall, ata minimum, establish priorities, establish requirements for State stormwater management programs, and establish expeditious deadlines. The provisionprovides EPA with broad authority and discretion to fashion the comprehensiveregulatory program, which may include performance standards, guidelines,guidance, and management practices and treatment requirements, as appropriate.As stated earlier in today's notice, one goal in evaluating public commentsreceived in response to today's notice is to gather information for thesestudies. To facilitate information gathering for the studies, the Agencyis proposing an initial framework for State storm water management programs.This initial framework is intended to encourage States to participate inthe development of the Section 402(p)(5) studies, and the subsequent developmentof regulations. EPA will use information collected in this manner, alongwith other information, such as section 305(b) reports, as guidance indeveloping storm water programs with the flexibility to target prioritiesof individual States to the extent necessary to mitigate impacts on waterquality associated with storm water discharges.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Economic Impact</ITAG>EPA has prepared an Information Collection Request for the purpose of estimatingthe information collection burden imposed on Federal, State and local governmentsand industry by proposed revisions to NPDES permit application requirementsfor storm water discharges codified in 40 CFR Part 122. The Agency is proposingthese revisions in response to Section 402(p)(4) of the Clean Water Act,as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA). The proposed revisionswould apply to: storm water discharges associated with industrial activity;discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems serving a populationof 250,000 or more and discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systemsserving a population of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000.The annual cost for applying for NPDES permits for discharges from municipalseparate storm sewer systems was estimated to be $5.7 million. EPA estimatesthat an average application for a permit for all discharges from a municipalseparate storm sewer system serving a population of 250,000 or more wouldcost $131,200 to prepare, or 8,534 hours, while an average applicationfor a permit for all discharges from a municipal separate storm sewer systemserving a population of 100,000 or more, but less than 250,000 would cost$83,600 to prepare, or 5,438 hours, annually. The annual respondent costfor NPDES permit applications for storm water discharges for industrialactivities was estimated to be $7.6 million or 238,644 hours. EPA estimatesthat an average application for a permit application for a storm waterdischarge associated with industrial activity (other than constructionactivities) would cost $1011.20, or 31.6 hours to prepare. The averagecost to prepare a prepare a permit application for a storm water dischargeassociated with industrial activity from a construction activities wouldbe $144.00 or 4.5 hours. The annual respondent cost for facilities whichdischarge storm water associated with industrial activity to a municipalseparate storm sewer system serving a population of 100,000 or more tonotify the operator of the municipal storm sewer is estimated to be $9.4million. The average cost for facilities which discharge storm water associatedwith industrial activity to municipal separate storm sewer system servinga populaton of 100,000 or more to notify the operator of the municipalseparate storm sewer system would be $195.20 or 6.1 hours. The annual costto the Federal Government and approved states for administration of theprogram was estimated to be $0.46 million. In summary, the total burdenfor municipalities, industry, and state and federal authorities was estimatedto equal $23.4 million.In general, the cost estimates provided in the ICR focus primarily on thecosts associated with developing, submitting and reviewing the permit applicationsassociated with today's notice. The Agency will continue to evaluate proceduresand methods to control storm water discharges to the extent necessary tomitigate impacts on water quality in the studies required under Section402(p)(5) of the CWA (see section IV of today's notice). One purpose ofthese studies will be to evaluate the costs and water quality benefitsassociated with implementing these procedures and methods. This information,along with information gained during permit implementation will aid inthe dynamic long-term development of storm water control efforts. EPA invitesthe public to submit information regarding the cost of implementing stormwater controls to aid in the completion of these studies.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires EPA and other agencies to perform regulatoryanalyses of major regulations. Major rules are those which impose a coston the economy of $100 million or more annually or have certain other economicimpacts. Today's proposed amendments would generally make the NPDES permitapplication regulations more flexible and less burdensome for the regulatedcommunity. These regulations would not, if promulgated satisfy any of thecriteria specified in section 1(b) of the Executive Order and, as such,would not constitute a major rule. This regulation was submitted to theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.<ITAG tagnum="84">X.

The public reporting burdenfor permit applications for storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity from a construction activities is estimated to average 4.5 hoursper response. The public reporting burden for facilities which dischargestorm water associated with industrial activity to municipal separate stormsewers serving a population of 100,000 to notify the operator of the municipalseparate storm sewer system is estimated to average 6.1 hours per response.The reporting burden for system-wide permit applications for dischargesfrom municipal separate storm sewer systems serving a population of 250,000or more is estimated to average 945.5 hours per response in the Part 1application and 7589 hours per response in the Part 2 application. Thereporting burden for system-wide permit applications for discharges frommunicipal separate storm sewer systems serving a population of 100,000or more, but less than 250,000 is estimated to average 515.5 hours perresponse in the Part 1 application and 4923 hours per response in the Part2 application. Estimates of reporting burden include time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20490; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget; Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''.

When ``quantitativedata'' for a pollutant are required, the applicant must collect a sampleof effluent and analyze it for the pollutant in accordance with analyticalmethods approved under 40 CFR Part 136. When no analytical method is approvedthe applicant may use any suitable method but must provide a descriptionof the method. When an applicant has two or more outfalls with substantiallyidentical effluents, the Director may allow the applicant to test onlyone outfall and report that the quantitative data also apply to the substantiallyidentical outfalls. The requirements in paragraphs (g)(7)(iii) and (iv)of this section that an applicant must provide quantitative data for certainpollutants known or believed to be present do not apply to pollutants presentin a discharge solely as the result of their presence in intake water;however, an applicant must report such pollutants as present. Grab samplesmust be used for pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, residual chlorine,oil and grease, fecal coliform and fecal streptococcus. For all other pollutants,24-hour composite samples must be used. However, a minimum of one grabsample may be taken for effluents from holding ponds or other impoundmentswith a retention period greater than 24 hours. In addition, for dischargesother than storm water discharges, the Director may waive composite samplingfor any outfall for which the applicant demonstrates that the use of anautomatic sampler is infeasible and that the minimum of four (4) grab sampleswill be a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. For stormwater discharges, all samples shall be collected from the discharge resultingfrom the first storm event after a minimum period of 96 hours without ameasurable (greater than 0.1 inch rainfall) storm event. For storm waterdischarges, a grab sample shall be taken during the first twenty minutesof the discharge, and a flow-weighted composite shall be taken for eitherthe entire discharge or for the first three hours of the discharge. Theflow-weighted composite sample for a storm water discharge may be takenwith a continuous sampler or as a combination of a minimum of three samplealiquots taken in each hour of discharge for the entire discharge or forthe first three hours of the discharge, with each aliquot being separatedby a minimum period of fifteen minutes. However, a minimum of one grabsample may be taken for storm water discharges from holding ponds or otherimpoundments with a retention period greater than 24 hours. For a flow-weightedcomposite sample, only one analysis of the composite of aliquots is required.For storm water discharge samples quantitative data must be reported forthe grab sample taken during the first twenty minutes of the dischargefor all pollutants specified in andSection;122.26, and for flow-weightedcomposites, quantitative data must be reported for all pollutants specifiedin andSection;122.26 except pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, residualchlorine, oil and grease, fecal coliform and fecal streptococcus. The Directormay establish appropriate site-specific sampling requirements, includingthe location of the outfall to be sampled, the season the sampling takesplace, the minimum duration between the previous measurable storm eventand the storm event sampled and the form of percipitation sampled (snowmelt or rain fall). An applicant is expected to ``know or have reason tobelieve'' that a pollutant is present in an effluent based on an evaluationof the expected use, production, or storage of the pollutant, or on anyprevious analyses for the pollutant. (For example, any pesticide manufacturedby a facility may be expected to be present in contaminated storm waterrunoff from the facility.) <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(g)(10) (removed and reserved) <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(k) <T3>Application requirements for new sources and new discharges.</T3> Newmanufacturing, commercial, mining and silvicultural dischargers applyingfor NPDES permits (except for new discharges of facilities subject to therequirements of andSection;122.21(h) or new discharges of storm water associatedwith industrial activity which are subject to the requirements of andSection;122.26(c)(1)and this section (except as provided by andSection;122.26(c)(1)(ii)) shallprovide the following information to the Director, using the applicationforms provided by the Director: <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>4.

This designation may includea discharge from any conveyance or system of conveyances used for collectingand conveying storm water runoff or a system of discharges from municipalseparate storm sewers, except for those discharges from conveyances whichdo not require a permit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or agriculturalstorm water runoff which is exempted from the definition of point sourceat 122.2. The Director or the EPA Regional Administrator may designatedischarges from municipal separate storm sewers on a system-wide or jurisdiction-widebasis. In making this determination the Director or the EPA Regional Administratormay consider the following factors:(A) The location of the discharge with respect to waters of the UnitedStates;(B) The size of the discharge;(C) The quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged to waters of theUnited States; and(D) Other relevant factors.(2) The Director may not require a permit for discharges of storm waterrunoff from mining operations or oil and gas exploration, production, processingor treatment operations or transmission facilities, composed entirely offlows which are from conveyances or systems of conveyances (including butnot limited to pipes, conduits, ditches, and channels) used for collectingand conveying precipitation, runoff and which are not contaminated by contactwith or that has not come into contact with, any overburden, raw material,intermediate products, finished product, byproduct or waste products locatedon the site of such operations. Contaminated storm water runoff from miningoperations includes runoff which contain pollutants above natural backgroundlevels.

The Director may issueone system-wide permit covering all, or a portion of all municipal separatestorm sewers in adjacent or interconnected large or medium municipal separatestorm sewer systems.(v) Permits for all or a portion of all discharges from large or mediummunicipal separate storm sewer systems that are issued on a system-wide,jurisdiction-wide, watershed or other basis may specify different conditionsrelating to different discharges covered by the permit, including differentmanagement programs for different drainage areas which contribute stormwater to the system.(vi) Co-permittees need only comply with permit conditions relating todischarges from the municipal separate storm sewers for which they areoperators.(vii) (A) Operators of storm water discharges associated with industrialactivity which discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer system arenot required to submit an individual NPDES permit application or participatein a group application for such discharge provided:(<T3>1</T3>) The operator of such a storm water discharge submits, to themunicipality responsible for the municipal separate storm sewer receivingthe discharge by no later than [<T3>insert 180 days from date of publication of final rule</T3>] or priorto commencing such discharge: the name of the facility; the location ofthe discharge; a description (such as SIC codes) which best reflects theprincipal products or services provided by each facility; existing quantitativedata (including flow estimates and sampling data) describing the discharge;and a certification that, if feasible, the discharge has been tested forthe presence of non-storm water discharges. The certification shall includea description of the results of any test for the presence of non-stormwater discharges, the method used, the date of any testing, and the on-sitedrainage points that were directly observed during a test, or why the testwas not feasible;(<T3>2</T3>) Such discharge is composed entirely of storm water;(<T3>3</T3>) Such discharge is in compliance with applicable conditionsof the NPDES permit issued for the discharge from the municipal separatestorm sewer which receives the storm water discharge associated with industrialactivity, provided the discharger has been notified of such conditions;and (<T3>4</T3>) Such discharges do not contain a hazardous substance in excessof reporting quantities established at 40 CFR 117.3 or 40 CFR 302.4.(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3)(vii) (A) of this section, for thepurpose of appropriate oversight and enforcement, the Director, or in Stateswith approved NPDES programs, either the Director or the EPA Regional Administrator,may require an individual permit for a discharge of storm water associatedwith industrial activity to a municipal separate storm sewer. Cases wherean individual permit may be required include, but are not limited to: (<T3>1</T3>) The discharge is not compliance with the provisions of paragraph(a)(3) (vii) (A) of this Section; or (<T3>2</T3>) The discharge potentially contains toxic pollutants or hazardoussubstances in amounts that may interfere with water quality objectives.(viii) All discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer that are notcomposed entirely of storm water must obtain a NPDES permit in accordancewith the requirements of Part 122. (4) <T3>Other Municipal Separate Storm Sewers. </T3>The Director may issuepermits for municipal separate storm sewers that are designated under paragraph(a)(1)(v) of this section on a system-wide basis, jurisdiction-wide basis,watershed basis or other appropriate basis, or may issue permits for individualdischarges.

(i) All storm water discharges associated with industrial activity thatdischarge into a storm water discharge system that is not a municipal separatestorm sewer must either be covered by an individual permit or a permitissued to the operator of the portion of the system that directly dischargesto waters of the United States.(ii) Where there is more than one operator of a single system of such conveyances,all operators of storm water discharges associated with industrial activitymust be identified in the application submitted by the operator of theportion of the system that discharges directly to waters of the UnitedStates. Any such application shall include all information regarding stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity that discharge intothe system that would be required if the dischargers submitted separateapplications. The operator of a storm water discharge so identified shallnot be required to obtain an individual NPDES permit unless the Directorspecifies otherwise. (iii) Any permit covering more than one operator shall identify the effluentlimitations, or other permit conditions, if any, that apply to each operator.(6) <T3>Combined Sewer Systems. </T3>Conveyances that discharge storm waterrunoff combined with municipal sewage are point sources that must obtainNPDES permits in accordance with the procedures of andSection; 122.21 andare not subject to the provisions of this section.

Each part of this item addresses a differentset of pollutants and must be completed in accordance with the specificinstructions for that part. The following general instructions apply tothe entire item.General InstructionsPart A requires you to report at least one analysis for each pollutantlisted. Parts B and C require you to report analytical data in two ways.For some pollutants addressed in Parts B and C, if you know or have reasonto know that the pollutant is present in your discharge, you may be requiredto list the pollutant and test (sample and analyze) and report the levelsof the pollutants in your discharge. For all other pollutants addressedin Parts B and C, you must list the pollutant if you know or have reasonto know that the pollutant is present in the discharge, and either reportquantitative data for the pollutant or briefly describe the reasons thepollutant is expected to be discharged. (See specific instructions on theform and below for Parts A through C.) Base your determination that a pollutantis present in or absent from your discharge on your knowledge of your rawmaterials, material management practices, maintenance chemicals, historyof spills and releases, intermediate and final products and byproducts,and any previous analyses known to you of your effluent or similar effluent.<T3>A. Sampling: </T3>The collection of the samples for the reported analysesshould be supervised by a person experienced in performing sampling ofindustrial wastewater or stormwater discharges. You may contact EPA oryour State permitting authority for detailed guidance on sampling techniquesand for answers to specific questions. Any specific requirements containedin the applicable analytical methods should be followed for sample containers,sample preservation, holding times, the collection of duplicate samples,etc. The time when you sample should be representative, to the extent feasible,of your treatment system operating properly with no system upsets. Samplesshould be collected from the center of the flow channel, where turbulenceis at a maximum, at a site specified in your present permit, or at anysite adequate for the collection of a representative sample.For pH, temperature, cyanide, total phenols, residual chlorine, oil andgrease, and fecal coliform, grab samples taken during the first 20 minutesof the discharge must be used (you are not required to analyze a flow-weightedcomposite for these parameters). For all other pollutants both a grab samplecollected during the first 20 minutes of the discharge and a flow-weightedcomposite sample must be analyzed. However, a minimum of one grab samplemay be taken for effluents from holding ponds or other impoundments witha retention period of greater than 24 hours.All samples shall be collected from a discharge resulting from the firststorm event after a minimum period of 96 hours without a measurable (greaterthan 0.1 inch rainfall) storm event.A grab sample shall be taken during the first twenty minutes of the discharge,and a flow-weighted composite shall be taken for the entire event or forthe first three hours of the event.Grab and composite samples are defined as follows:<T3>Grab sample: </T3>An individual sample of at least 100 milliliterscollected during the first twenty minutes of the discharge. This sampleis to be analyzed separately from the composite sample.<T3>Flow-Weighted Composite sample: </T3>A flow-weighted composite samplemay be taken with a continuous sampler that proportions the amount of samplecollected with the flow rate or as a combination of a minimum of threesample aliquots taken in each hour of discharge for the entire event orfor the first three hours of the event, with each aliquot being at least100 milliliters and collected with a minimum period of fifteen minutesbetween aliquot collections. The composite must be flow proportional; eitherthe time interval between each aliquot or the volume of each aliquot mustbe proportional to either the stream flow at the time of sampling or thetotal stream flow since the collection of the previous aliquot. Aliquotsmay be collected manually or automatically. For GC/MS Volatile OrganicAnalysis (VOA), aliquots must be combined in the laboratory immediatelybefore analysis. Only one analysis for the composite sample is required.The Agency is currently reviewing sampling requirements in light of recentresearch on testing methods. Upon completion of its review, the Agencyplans to propose changes to the sampling requirements. Data from samples taken in the past may be used, provided that: All data requirements are met; Sampling was done no more than three years before submission; and All data are representative of the present discharge. Among the factors which would cause the data to be unrepresentative aresignificant changes in production level, changes in raw materials, processes,or final products, and changes in stormwater treatment. When the Agencypromulgates new analytical methods in 40 CFR Part 136, EPA will provideinformation as to when you should use the new methods to generate dataon your discharges. Of course, the Director may request additional information,including current quantitative data, if they determine it to be necessaryto assess your discharges. <T3>B. Reporting: </T3>All levels must be reported as concentration andas total mass. You may report some or all of the required data by attachingseparate sheets of paper instead of filling out pages VII-1 and VII-2 ifthe separate sheets contain all the required information in a format whichis consistent with pages VII-1 and VII-2 in spacing and in identificationof pollutants and columns. Use the following abbreviations in the columnsheaded ``Units.'' <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,s25,r25</C> <H1>Concentration</H1><H1>Mass</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">ppm=parts per million<D>lbs=pounds. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">mg/l=milligrams per liter<D>ton=tons (English tons). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ppb=parts per billion<D>mg=milligrams. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">mg/l=micrograms per liter<D>g=grams. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">kg=kilograms<D>T=tonnes (metric tons).</D></ITAG></ITAG>All reporting of values for metals must be in terms of ``total recoverablemetal,'' unless: (1) An applicable, promulgated effluent limitation or standard specifiesthe limitation for the metal in dissolved, valent, or total form; or (2) All approved analytical methods for the metal inherently measure onlyits dissolved form (e.g., hexavalent chromium); or (3) The permitting authority has determined that in establishing case-by-caselimitations it is necessary to express the limitations on the metal indissolved, valent, or total form to carry out the provisions of the CWA.If you measure only one grab sample and one flow-weighted composite samplefor a given outfall, complete only the ``Maximum Values'' columns and insert``1'' into the ``Number of Storm Events Sampled'' column. The permittingauthority may require you to conduct additional analyses to further characterizeyour discharges. If you measure more than one value for a grab sample or a flow-weightedcomposite sample for a given outfall and those values are representativeof your discharge, you must report them. You must describe your methodof testing and data analysis. You also must determine the average of allvalues within the last year and report the concentration mass under the``Average Values'' columns, and the total number of storm events sampledunder the ``Number of Storm Events Sampled'' columns. <T3>C. Analysis: </T3>You must use test methods promulgated in 40 CFR Part136; however, if none has been promulgated for a particular pollutant,you may use any suitable method for measuring the level of the pollutantin your discharge provided that you submit a description of the methodor a reference to a published method. Your description should include thesample holding time, preservation techniques, and the quality control measureswhich you used. If you have two or more substantially identical outfalls,you may request permission from your permitting authority to sample andanalyze only one outfall and submit the results of the analysis for othersubstantially identical outfalls. If your request is granted by the permittingauthority, on a separate sheet attached to the application form, identifywhich outfall you did test, and describe why the outfalls which you didnot test are substantially identical to the outfall which you did test.Part VII-APart VII-A must be completed by all applicants for all outfalls who mustcomplete Form 2F.Analyze a grab sample collected during the first twenty minutes of thedischarge and flow-weighted composite samples for all pollutants in thisPart, and report the results except use only grab samples for pH and oiland grease. See discussion in General Instructions to Item VII for definitionsof grab sample collected during the first twenty minutes of discharge andflow-weighted composite sample. The ``Average Values'' column is not compulsorybut should be filled out if data are available.Part VII-BList all pollutants that are limited in an effluent guideline which thefacility is subject to (see 40 CFR Subchapter N to determine which pollutantsare limited in effluent guidelines) or any pollutant listed in the facility'sNPDES permit for its process wastewater (if the facility is operating underan existing NPDES permit). Complete one table for each outfall. See discussionin General instructions to item VII for definitions of grab sample collectedduring the first twenty minutes of discharge and flow-weighted compositesample. The ``Average Values'' column is not compulsory but should be filledout if data are available.Analyze a grab sample collected during the first twenty minutes of thedischarge and flow-weighted composite samples for all pollutants in thisPart, and report the results, except as provided in the General Instructions.Part VII-CPart VII-C must be completed by all applicants for all outfalls which dischargestormwater associated with industrial activity, or that EPA is evaluatingfor designation as a significant contributor of pollutants to waters ofthe United States, or as contributing to a violation of a water qualitystandard. Use both a grab sample and a composite sample for all pollutantsyou analyze for in this part except use grab samples for residual chlorineand fecal coliform. The ``Average Values'' column is not compulsory butshould be filled out if data are available. Part C requires you to addressthe pollutants in Table 2F-2, 2F-3, and 2F-4 for each outfall. Pollutantsin each of these Tables are addressed differently.<T3>Table 2F-2: </T3>For each outfall, list all pollutants in Table 2F-2that you know or have reason to believe are discharged (except pollutantspreviously listed in Part VII-B). If a pollutant is limited in an effluentguideline limitation which the facility is subject to (e.g., use of TSSas an indicator to control the discharge of iron and aluminum), the pollutantshould be listed in Part VII-B. If a pollutant in Table 2F-2 is indirectlylimited by an effluent guideline limitation through an indicator, you mustanalyze for it and report data in Part VII-C. For other pollutants listedin Table 2F-2 (those not limited directly or indirectly by an effluentlimitation guideline), that you know or have reason to believe are discharges,you must either report quantitative data or briefly describe the reasonsthe pollutant is expected to be discharged.<T3>Table 2F-3: </T3>For each outfall, list all pollutants in Table 2F-3that you know or have reason to believe are discharged. For every pollutantin Table 2F-3 expected to be discharged in concentrations of 10 ppb orgreater, you must submit quantitative data. For acrolein, acrylonitrile,2,4 dinitrophenol, and 2-methyl-4, 6 dinitrophenol, you must submit quantitativedata if any of these four pollutants is expected to be discharged in concentrationsof 100 ppb or greater. For every pollutant expected to be discharged inconcentrations less than 10 ppb (or 100 ppb for the four pollutants listedabove), then you must either submit quantitative data or briefly describethe reasons the pollutant is expected to be discharged.<T3>Small Business Exemption_</T3>If you are a ``small business,'' youare exempt from the reporting requirements for the organic toxic pollutantslisted in Table 2F-3. There are two ways in which you can qualify as a``small business''. If your facility is a coal mine, and if your probabletotal annual production is less than 100,000 tons per year, you may submitpast production data or estimated future production (such as a scheduleof estimated total production under 30 CFR 795.14(c)) instead of conductinganalyses for the organic toxic pollutants. If your facility is not a coalmine, and if your gross total annual sales for the most recent three yearsaverage less than $100,000 per year (in second quarter 1980 dollars), youmay submit sales data for those years instead of conducting analyses forthe organic toxic pollutants. The production or sales data must be forthe facility which is the source of the discharge. The data should notbe limited to production or sales for the process or processes which contributeto the discharge, unless those are the only processes at your facility.For sales data, in situations involving intracorporate transfer of goodsand services, the transfer price per unit should approximate market pricesfor those goods and services as closely as possible. Sales figures foryears after 1980 should be indexed to the second quarter of 1980 by usingthe gross national product price deflator (second quarter of 1980=100).This index is available in National Income and Product Accounts of theUnited States (Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis).<T3>Table 2F-4:</T3> For each outfall, list any pollutant in Table 2F-4that you know or believe to be present in the discharge and explain whyyou believe it to be present. No analysis is required, but if you haveanalytical data, you must report them. <T3>NOte:</T3> Under 40 CFR 117.12(a)(2), certain discharges of hazardoussubstances (listed at 40 CFR 177.21 or 40 CFR 302.4) may be exempted fromthe requirements of section 311 of CWA, which establishes reporting requirements,civil penalties, and liability for cleanup costs for spills of oil andhazardous substances. A discharge of a particular substance may be exemptedif the origin, source, and amount of the discharged substances are identifiedin the NPDES permit application or in the permit, if the permit containsa requirement for treatment of the discharge, and if the treatment is inplace. To apply for an exclusion of the discharge of any hazardous substancefrom the requirements of section 311, attach additional sheets of paperto your form, setting forth the following information:1. The substance and the amount of each substance which may be discharged.2. The origin and source of the discharge of the substance.3. The treatment which is to be provided for the discharge by:a. An onsite treatment system separate from any treatment system treatingyour normal discharge;b. A treatment system designed to treat your normal discharge and whichis additionally capable of treating the amount of the substance identifiedunder paragraph 1 above; orc. Any combination of the above.See 40 CFR 117.12 (a)(2) and (c), published on August 29, 1979, in 44 FR50766, or contact your Regional Office (Table 1 on Form 1, Instructions),for further information on exclusions from section 311.Part VII-DIf sampling is conducted during more than one storm event, you only needto report the information requested in Part VII-D for the storm event(s)which resulted in any maximum pollutant concentration reported in PartVII-A, VII-B, or VII-C.Provide flow measurements or estimates of the flow rate, and the totalamount of discharge for the storm event(s) sampled, the method of flowmeasurement, or estimation. Provide the data and duration of the stormevent(s) sampled, rainfall measurements, or estimates of the storm eventwhich generated the sampled runoff and the duration between the storm eventsampled and the end of the previous measurable (greater than 0.1 inch rainfall)storm event.Part VII-EList any toxic pollutant listed in Table 2F-2, 2F-3, or 2F-4 which youcurrently use or manufacture as an intermediate or final product or byproduct.In addition, if you know or have reason to believe that 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin(TCDD) is discharged or if you use or manufacture 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5,-T); 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propanoic acid (Silvex,2,4,5,-TP); 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) ethyl, 2,2-dichloropropionate (Erbon);O,O-dimethyl O-(2,4,5-trichlorphenyl) phosphorothioate (Ronnel); 2,4,5-trichlorophenol(TCP); or hexachlorophene (HCP); then list TCDD. The Director may waiveor modify the requirement if you demonstrate that it would be unduly burdensometo identify each toxic pollutant and the Director has adequate informationto issue your permit.
