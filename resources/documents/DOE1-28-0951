The polymer solution shows drag reduction in pipe flowonly within turbulent regime, and the turbulent pipe flow of polymersolution may be classified into polymeric flow regime and maximum dragreduction flow regime. In the former case the drag reduction percentageE is related to polymer concentration, and in the case E is independentof polymer concentration. When the solution achieves maximum drag reduction,a further increase in polymer concentration shows no effect at all. DomesticPAM (FLA-801), exhibits excellent characteristics of drag reduction.A polymer concentration of 10 wppm gives immediate drag reduction flowregion regime. Maximum drag reduction is obtained with a polymer concentrationhigher than 50 wppm. The friction factor relation of maximum drag reductionmatches Virk's maximum drag reduction asymptote. The pressure drop versusflow rate shows that in laminar flow the pressure drop of polymer solutionis more than that of water at the same flow rate, and in turbulent flowit is less than that of water. The critical flow rate, which marks thebeginning of drag reduction, increases as the polymer concentration isincreased.</TEXT></DOC>
