DEA officials expressed outrage Monday at being issued a``notice of violation'' for burning 1,042 pounds of contrabandcocaine on Feb. 23 in a U.S. Department of Agriculture incineratorin Lakewood, a suburb of Denver.   ``What do they think we're going to do with it _ ship it back toColombia?'' asked DEA spokesman Ron Hollingshead.   Hollingshead said at first he thought a phone call about thealleged violation was a joke.   Harry Collier, a state air pollution control specialist, saidthe department acted after receiving several complaints about adense column of smoke when the cocaine was burned.   The DEA used the incinerator because it could burn the drug at atemperature exceeding 800 degrees, Hollingshead said. The hightemperature was needed to keep the cocaine burn from turning into``the world's biggest crack cookout,'' he said.   Collier said the DEA could have found other incinerators thatwould have complied with the clean air law.</TEXT></DOC>
