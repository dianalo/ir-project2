He said the Senate vote ``was astrong indication of concern in that regard.''   By a vote of 66-34 Tuesday, the Senate turned aside aRepublican-backed attempt to restore funds to Star Wars, formallyknown as the Strategic Defense Initiative, to a level closer to the$4.5 billion approved by the Senate in its authorization bill lastmonth.   Mitchell said the vote amounted to a major blow to the program.Then-President Reagan proposed Star Wars six years ago, hailing itas a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States.   The funding level adopted in the $288 billion appropriationsbill totals about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billion for the Pentagon'sprogram and $355 million in Energy Department and militaryconstruction money. That amount falls $900 million short of whatBush requested for the program in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who arenegotiating with House members on a final defense authorizationbill, said the chamber's votes undermine chances that Star Warsspending will be higher than the $4.1 billion spent in fiscal 1989.   The House this year approved a defense blueprint that earmarks$3.1 billion for Star Wars.   ``There isn't any question that SDI is extremely weak. It looksto me now that it will be under last year's level when we get outof conference,'' Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said shortly after theSenate action.   ``It's continuing the downward pressure,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth,D-Colo. ``There's an increase in the effort to make it a researchprogram, where it belongs.''   Lawmakers said the Soviet Union's announcement this weekend thatit would separate Star Wars from negotiations on a treaty to reducestrategic arms may have taken steam out of the drive to increaseSDI spending.   ``SDI has now been cut loose,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia,ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.   But some members said that since Star Wars was also one ofseveral items in an $8.5 billion amendment to the spending bill,the Senate vote was not a clearcut referendum on the program.   ``This was not pro-SDI or anti-SDI,'' said Sen. William Cohen,R-Maine, a member of the Armed Services panel. ``They put in Apachehelicopters, the space program, sealift.''   The amendment with the increased Star Wars spending, introducedby Warner and Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., would have also restored$910 million for the submarine-based, long-range Trident 2 nuclearmissile and reduced funds for the Apache helicopter.   In other action, the Senate:   _Rejected, 71-29, an amendment that would have cut $2.7 billionfrom Bush's request for $4.7 billion next year to buy and test thefirst 13 models of the B-2 stealth bomber.   _Overwhelmingly endorsed a cost-saving plan to shut down 86military bases and scale back five more. The vote was 86-14.   _Approved, 65-34, a non-binding resolution calling on Bush toreport to Congress before April 1, 1990 on the U.S. military'spresence in South Korea. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., had proposed areduction of 3,000 in the 43,800 U.S. troops stationed in the Asiannation, but the sense of Congress measure prevailed.   _Approved the transfer of $135 million from the DefenseDepartment to the Energy Department for the restart of the threetritium reactors at the Savannah River nuclear plant.   _Provided $20 million in military assistance for Jordan. Thisamendment was introduced at the request of Bush and approved byvoice vote.   _Approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in theCaribbean and United States damaged last week by Hurricane Hugo.The total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available butSen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the plan's sponsor, said $50 millionwas for a Navy shipyard in Charleston and $25 million was for ShawAir Force Base.</TEXT></DOC>
