(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A procurement officer with the MarineCorps and two defense industry figures pleaded guilty today tocriminal charges in the government's investigation of wrongdoing inthe Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing operation.   The Marine official, Jack A. Sherman, 52, admitted in U.S.District Court that he accepted bribes in return for providingconfidential information about Pentagon contracts. He agreed tocooperate with prosecutors in the continuing investigation.   Also pleading guilty were Robert Barrett, a former executive atUnisys Corp., a defense contractor, and Joseph E. Hill, a consultantwho did work for Unisys and its predecessor, Sperry Corp.   The two men entered guilty pleas to various charges stemming fromillegal campaign contributions to members of Congress knowledgeableabout the defense procurement business.   It was the first time that congressional campaigns had beenpublicly linked by prosecutors to the defense procurement scandal,code-named Operation Ill Wind.   Today's pleas marked a continuation of court actions in theinvestigation.   On Jan. 6, a federal grand jury here indicted a Navy employee,five other individuals and the defense contractor TeledyneElectronics with a variety of charges including conspiracy,racketeering and bribery. The same day, Hazeltine Corp. and five menpleaded guilty to a different set of charges.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph J. Aronica said Sherman wascharged with two counts: conspiracy to commit bribery and thereceipt of bribes by a public official. He faces a maximum of 20years in prison and a $500,000 fine.   Prosecutors said Sherman received a total of $43,500 betweenOctober 1986 and June 1987 from an unnamed consultant. The FBIrecorded either by audiotape or videotape 16 meetings between theconsultant and Sherman, prosecutors said.   ``In return for the offers and payments of money, Sherman agreedto perform and did perform acts which were ... in violation of hisduties as a Marine Corps employee,'' prosecutors said in a statementof facts.   They said Sherman agreed to provide the consultant withconfidential information relating to the competitive process on a $6million contract that Sherman was responsible for awarding.   Sherman also provided the consultants in April 1987 with internalgovernment documents on an upcoming $100 million contract that acompany paying the consultant won.   The prosecutors detailed a complex arrangement in which Shermanwas also receiving money from other consultants who were paid byvarious defense contractors. None of the consultants or thecompanies was named in the court documents.   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton set Sherman's sentencingfor April 7.   In the pleas involving campaign contributions Barrett, 55,pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and inaiding and abetting in making false statements to the government. Hefaces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.   The government charged that Barrett was involved in a complicatedscheme in which money was funneled to the election campaign offormer Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla. Chappell chaired the House defenseappropriations subcommittee until his defeat last November.   According to prosecutors, Sperry-Unisys paid consultants with theunderstanding that the consultants would contribute an unspecifiedportion of the funds to political campaigns.   Barrett collected undated checks from the individuals and gavethem to another agent of Unisys who made the contributions toChappell's campaign in 1986 and 1987, prosecutors said.   Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., pleaded guilty to four misdemeanorcounts of making political contributions in the name of another. Hefaces a maximum of four years in prison and a fine of $400,000.   Prosecutors said Hill was paid by Sperry-Unisys and ``was ...asked by representatives of Sperry-Unisys to make numerouscontributions in his name.''   Between 1982 and 1988 he contributed over $25,000 to politicalcampaigns at the direction of his employer, prosecutors said.   Among the campaigns to whom Hill contributed in 1987 and 1988were those of Reps. Roy Dyson, D-Md.; Rep. William Dickinson,R-Ala.; and Richard Ray, D-Ga., and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.</TEXT></DOC>
