Under a plan drafted by the Immigration and NaturalizationService, specially trained INS hearing officers would conductinformal proceedings to consider an alien's claim for asylum status.   One critic of the proposal said it would ``obliterate fairnessand due process'' for asylum seekers that is now provided byimmigration law.   The proposal, which is still under study, would ``provide forsummary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports of entry whofail to make a credible showing'' of eligibility, according to aninternal Justice Department analysis of the plan.   ``This should discourage those who are claiming asylum, but infact have no legitimate right to this status, from attempting toenter the United States under this claim,'' according to thedocument.   People seeking asylum must demonstrate a ``well-founded fear ofpersecution'' for a variety of factors, including ethnic backgroundand political or religious beliefs.   The proposal to amend current immigration law would requireapproval by Congress.   It was drafted by INS in the wake of the flood of CentralAmericans crossing the border from Mexico into Texas over the last10 months.   Most were denied political asylum on the ground that they werefleeing poverty, not political persecution.   Gregory J. Leo, director of legislative affairs for INS, saidthe proposal was in an ``early stage of review.''   He described the plan as a ``legislative proposal that has beengenerated at a staff level'' and circulated to various divisions ofthe Justice Department, including the office of Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh.   It was drafted as a possible solution to the ``misuse or abuseof the asylum process'' by Central Americans who come to the borderwithout a legal claim for political asylum status, Leo said.   ``The present system allows an alien to make successiveapplications to the district (INS) director and to an immigrationjudge, leading to a time-consuming process,'' the department'sanalysis said.   An adverse ruling by the immigration judge can be appealed tothe Board of Immigration Appeals and thence to federal circuitcourts of appeal _ a process that could extend an alien's stay formany months.   The draft proposal would eliminate the hearing mechanism foraliens at ports of entry who are denied political asylum.   ``There are people who would use the asylum process as a meansof staying here even though they are not qualified,'' Leo said.   But Arthur C. Helton, director of the political asylum projectof the non-profit Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said the planwould ``obliterate fairness and due process for most asylumseekers.''   ``This would be a very serious attack on asylum'' as a means ofentering the country, he said.   ``It would affect thousands of people arriving at the border,''Helton said.   In the 1988 fiscal year, 60,000 people sought asylum and ifcurrent rates continue the total for the current year will be morethan 100,000, Helton said.   The draft legislation also contains a provision that wouldincrease by 5,000 the number of refugee visas that would be grantedin the 1989 fiscal year for aliens from Central American nations.   Anyone seeking refugee status must apply in their own country.By increasing the number of visas by 5,000 authorities hope toencourage Central Americans to apply at U.S. embassies in theirhome countries, according to the draft.   INS is currently authorized to admit 3,500 eligible refugeesfrom Central America in the current fiscal year.   The INS proposal would abolish the right of aliens pressingclaims at immigration-court hearings to be represented by anattorney. When an alien is examined by an INS officer, an attorneycould act as an adviser but could not be an advocate, presentingevidence.   ``The officer's determination would be administratively final''but could be overruled by the attorney general or the INScommissioner, the proposal said.   The influx of refugees from Central America across the Texasborder over the last 10 months prompted INS to set up a detentionfacility for people awaiting immigration court hearings.   On Wednesday, 2,150 refugees were being detained at the INSfacility in Port Isabel, Texas. A total of 4,340 refugees werebeing detained at various INS locations in Texas, the agency said.   Aliens denied political aslyum are given the choice of returningto Mexico of facing detention while they await the outcome ofimmigration court proceedings.   The crisis stemmed from an upsurge in asylum applications at theborder crossing from the normal monthly total of about 400 to 5,000a month between June 1988 and Feb. 1.   The flow was reduced after INS imposed emergency procedures,enabling one-day processing of asylum applications at Port Isabel.   The proposal would also eliminate the right to apply forpolitical asylum at any point during a deportation proceeding.Aliens would be required to file a notice of intent to file such anapplication two weeks after the start of deportation proceedings.   The applicant would then have another 30 days to file the papers.   If the deadlines were missed, a political asylum claim would beallowed only if the alien showed ``changed circumstances'' in hishome country would make him qualified.</TEXT></DOC>
