Ellison, president and chief executive officerof Oracle Corp.andP;  &quot;That can be a little disconcerting to users.&quot;andM;When NCube, Beaverton, Ore., announced its new massively parallelsupercomputer last month, it is also announced ATandamp;T Co.'s System V UNIXoperating system and Oracle Corp.'s relational database management softwarewill run on the system.andM;The availability of the Oracle DBMS software on the NCube 2 will ensure thatnew applications will proliferate, said NCube president and chief executiveofficer Stephen R. Colley.andM;&quot;Database management and transaction processing applications will benefitfrom this performance at reduced cost per transaction and tremendousimprovements in throughputs,&quot; he said.andM;NCube 2 production shipments will begin in the fourth quarter of 1989 (seerelated story, Page 33) and the NCube and Oracle combination will beavailable in January 1990, Ellison said.andM;Oracle Version 6 makes the &quot;supercomputer as easy to use as a standardminicomputer,&quot; Ellison said.andP;  Applications will be able to run unchanged onthe NCube, IBM Corp. mainframes, Macintoshes and other systems.andP;  More than200 programs have been moved over to work in the NCube environment, Ellisonsaid.andM;The NCube Scalar Supercomputer will be able to perform 1,000 transactions persecond on smaller configurations and many more on larger configurations whencombined with the RDBMS, Ellison said.andM;&quot;Oracle's Parallel Server Architecture allows multiple copies of the DBMSsoftware and its tools run simultaneously on many central processors orcomputers, sharing the total workload and even cooperating in handling eachindividual user's request for transaction and database services,&quot; an Oraclestatement said.andM;Some processors can be dedicated to running UNIX applications, and othernodes can support Network File System and Oracle applications and a real-timeoperating system, Ellison said.andM;The processors will appear as one unified computer but can be reconfigured tomeet changing requirements.andM;Because users have a large investment in existing hardware, the NCube andOracle DBMS could be configured with existing IBM networks or other systems,and have an interface with VAXes and Sun workstations, Ellison said.andP;  TheNCube 2 would act as a back-end array processor or server to other computers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
