Strikers at the sprawling Lenin steel mill outside Krakow insouthern Poland issued a statement declaring: ``The economic policyof authorities of the Polish People's Republic has led millions ofworkers and their families to the limits of poverty. ... Our faithin party reforms is exhausted.''   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa earlier urged nationwide``pressure on the authorities'' to bring about reforms.   The strike was the biggest industrial action in Poland since the1981 crackdown on the now-outlawed Solidarity trade union movement,and it posed the sharpest challenge yet to government economicreform policies.   Another strike was threatened Friday at the 18,000-workerStalowa Wola heavy machinery plant in southeast Poland, and thegovernment prepared to enter talks Thursday with transit workers'representatives seeking higher pay.   A midnight negotiating session with management officials at theLenin steel mill ended after just 15 minutes, according to a strikecommittee member who was reached by telephone and spoke oncondition of anonymity.   ``The director said they were running out of possibilities ofsolving it politically, and later the ZOMO (riot police) would takeover,'' said the strike committee member.   On Wednesday, the second day of the stoppage, workers rejected abig pay raise offer.   ``We want our wages to assure us and our families a dignifiedlife and a proper rest after work,'' said the steel workers'statement, signed by 16 members of the workers' strike committeeand read over the telephone.   A strike committee member, Maciej Mach, said management hintedduring talks earlier Wednesday evening that force could be used tobreak the strike, but he said this only strengthened workers'resolve.   ``There is enormous pressure on us to stop,'' he said. ``Variousarguments are used, including psychological arguments, arguments offear that December 1981 may be repeated.''   On Dec. 13, 1981, soldiers and police suppressed Solidarity andarrested hundreds of union supporters.   Mach said the strike committee decided not to ask Walesa to jointhe talks, partly out of concern for him.   ``Let him remain (in Gdansk) where he is safe,'' he said.   Strikers called on the government to double the $15 compensationpaid for recent price increases to many groups, includingindustrial workers, retirees, teachers and health workers.   They demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in the average $105paid monthly pay to the Lenin plant's 32,000 workers, and turneddown a management offer of $50 in phased-in raises this year.   The strike committee ``firmly rejected'' the offer broadcastover loudspeakers to the workers Wednesday in a bid to break thestrike, said Jacek Kuron, a Solidarity adviser in Warsaw.   Organizers said 12,000 workers were on strike, with many stayingat the site after their shifts. Government spokesman Jerzy Urbansaid the number was 2,000.   An earlier round of talks that began at 6 p.m. broke off before9 p.m. without results, said a strike committee member who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Wieslaw Mazurkiewicz, another member of the hastily establishedstrike committee, reported, ``The mood is great. We are all decidedto strike until our demands are fully met.''   Outwardly, the plant appeared calm, with no banners and littleactivity.   Walesa lent his support to the strikers Wednesday in a statementissued from his home in Gdansk.   ``Our union appeals to all living social forces ... for theundertaking of united actions to put pressure on the authorities,''he said. ``Millions of people are waiting for restoration of therights of their trade union, Solidarity.''   The strike began Tuesday with 700 workers at the plant and thengrew. On Monday, 2,800 transit workers in the western city ofBydgoszcz staged an 11-hour strike and won hourly wage increases of60 percent.   Galloping inflation in Poland has created widespread pressurefor wage increases.   Prices in Poland shot up 42 percent in the first three months of1988 as a result of a government economic program to reducesubsidies on many consumer items. Part of the increase wascompensated for automatically, and the remainder was dependent onthe profitability of enterprises.   The state-run news agency PAP said Wednesday that raises givenwithout regard to an enterprise's ability to pay would underminethe entire reform.   Kuron said the strike poses a dilemma for the government.   ``If they give up at the Lenin mill, then everyone will lineup'' for raises, he said. ``If they stay tough, there could be amore violent confrontation.''   Urban, in an interview, said city transit workers in Lodz, Torunand Grudziadz requested raises after the Bydgoszcz settlement.   The head of the officially sanctioned union at the Lenin steelmill, Stanislaw Sitkowski, said many of his members were takingpart in the strike and, ``We do support these actions. ... We areof the opinion that wages are too low.''   After the banning of Solidarity, the government organized anofficially sanctioned trade union alliance, which claims 7 millionmembers. At its height, Solidarity said it had 10 million membersin the country of 37 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
