Leonard Brown ordered a toll-free 800 phone number a little more than a year ago, he hoped that it would drum up business for his Philadelphia-based container company.    Instead, it has brought him hundreds of calls about road conditions in Oregon.    The calls started flooding the offices of Canpak Inc. last fall, after snow hit the mountain passes of Oregon and a new telephone directory hit the streets of Eugene and Springfield. The directory, printed by Pacific Coast Publishing Inc., had erroneously listed the toll-free number of Mr. Brown's company as the one to dial for road and weather reports from the Oregon state police. Except for the 800 prefix, the numbers are identical.    At first, Mr. Brown assumed that the inquiries from anxious motorists were part of a prank, and he had a good laugh. But now, he says, &quot;it's getting to be a real nuisance. Even our maintenance guy gets calls on Saturdays.&quot;    So far, Mr. Brown estimates, Canpak has fielded at least 600 misdirected calls -- more than four times as many as those asking about the company's products. As calls to an 800 number are billed to the recipient, answering the weather queries has been expensive. Pacific Coast Publishing has promised to pick up the tab -- which Canpak claims is already about $200 -- but it can't correct the error until its new directory comes out in August. Meanwhile, some Oregon newspapers and TV stations have added to the confusion by repeating the error.    Not surprisingly, no one wants to take blame for the snafu. Max O'Neal, a manager at Pacific Coast Publishing, maintains that his company verified the number with the state police before publication. But Sgt. Arthur Bobrowitz denies that his fellow troopers would have given out the wrong one. &quot;There's been a breakdown of communication,&quot; he says. &quot;When people see 'road and weather,' they say, 'It must be an 800 number.' It absolutely snowballed.&quot;    For a while, Mr. Brown considered getting a different 800 number. But he rejected the idea because an industrial directory that contains his listing had already gone to press.    So now he is trying to make the best of a bad situation. He says he has learned quite a bit about Oregon geography and might even visit the state someday. &quot;The people,&quot; he says, &quot;are darn nice.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
