L. No. 91-508,(codified at 12 U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951 <T3>et seq.,</T3> and 31 U.S.C. 5311-5324), authorizes the Secretary ofthe Treasury to require financial institutions to file reports and keeprecords that the Secretary determines have a high degree of usefulnessin criminal, tax, and regulatory matters. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(2)(U),the Secretary has designated certain casinos as ``financial institutions''for purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act. <T3>See</T3> 31 CFR 103.11(g)(7). The Secretary has imposed particularreporting and recordkeeping requirements of these casinos. <T3>See</T3> 31 CFR 103.22(a)(2) and 103.36, respectively.The Internal Revenue Service, which has examination and enforcement jurisdictionover casinos in New Jersey and Puerto Rico, has found that testing forcompliance with the current reporting and recordkeeping requirements isdifficult because ``audit trails'' do not always exist.Treasury proposes herein new rules which are designed to assure full compliancewith the Bank Secrecy Act (hereinafter, ``the Act'') by casinos and tofacilitate compliance review. The rules proposed are set forth in sixteenamendments to the Bank Secrecy Act regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 1</ITAG>Amendment No. 1 continues to cite Pub. L. No. 91-508 as the statutory authorityfor 31 CFR 103.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 2</ITAG>Amendment No. 2 would slightly modify the meaning of the term ``casino''in andSection; 103.11(g)(7). The modifications are designed to: (a) Affirmthat licensed casinos in Puerto Rico and the territories and possessionsof the United States are subject to the Act and regulations thereunder;(b) define the concept of ``gross annual gaming revenue''; and (c) clarifythe point in time that a casino becomes subject to the Act and regulations,based on the amount of its gross gaming revenue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 3</ITAG>Amendment No. 3 would clarify the reporting requirements found in andSection;103.22(a)(2). New andSection; 103.22(a)(2) makes it clear that reportablecurrency transactions are those that involve either total cash in or totalcash out exceeding $10,000, and not a combination of cash in and cash outexceeding such amount, nor an offsetting of cash in and cash out transactionsagainst each other, as has been mistakenly believed by some casinos. Section103.22(a)(2) (i) and (ii) provides some examples of cash in and cash outtransactions, respectively. These are to be considered examples only, andnot a comprehensive or exhaustive list of all cash in and cash out transactions.They have been added in response to requests for delineations of typesof currency transactions that occur at casinos. It should be noted thatexchanges of currency for currency, including foreign currency, are tobe treated as both cash in and cash out transactions.New andSection; 103.22(a)(2)(iii) restates the rule already contained incurrent andSection; 103.22(a)(2) that multiple currency transactions shallbe treated as a single transaction, provided that the casino (a) has knowledgethat (b) they are by or on behalf of any person and (c) when aggregated,exceed $10,000 (d) during a ``gaming day'' (which is defined in proposedAmendment No. 16, below). Casinos have complained that, given the frequentlyswift and nearly frenzied activity of players on crowded casino floors,it often is very difficult to determine if and when a particular customerhas engaged in multiple transactions that meet the over-$10,000 threshold.New andSection; 103.22(a)(2)(iii) responds to this concern by clarifyingthat a casino will be deemed to have knowledge of multiple same-day transactionsby or on behalf of the same person which when aggregated exceed $10,000,not only if (a) an employee, director, officer, sole proprietor, or partner,has knowledge of the multiple transactions, but also if (b) the variousbooks, records, and similar documents, and information retained in a casino'sautomated data processing system or any existing manual system, which aremaintained by the casino pursuant to any Federal, State, or local law orregulation or in the regular course of business, contain information thatsuch multiple transactions have occurred. Because most casino players gambleat more than a single table in a gaming day, requiring casinos to checktheir internal information, books and records, and similar material isan effective way of assuring that multiple transactions are aggregatedand reported.The knowledge which an employee, director, officer, or partner obtainsmay be acquired in any manner. Thus, for example, if a casino supervisoris told by an employee that a player has purchased $6,000 in chips forcash and later the same gaming day the supervisor personally observes thesame player purchase another $6,000 in chips for cash, the supervisor,and thus the casino, would have the requisite knowledge that the two currencytransactions are (a) by the same person and (b) result in cash totallingmore than $10,000 (c) in one gaming day. Similarly, if a casino supervisorlearns from the casino's computer that a customer has purchased chips ata certain gaming table earlier in the gaming day for $6,000 in cash, andlater that day observes the same customer purchase another $6,000 in chipsfor cash, the supervisor, and thus the casino, is deemed to have knowledgeof the multiple transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments No. 4 and No. 5</ITAG>Amendment No. 5 is intended to assure that the requirements imposed ona casino, when it learns that multiple currency transactions are to betreated as a single one, can be reasonably complied with. Under AmendmentNo. 4, the existing andSection; 103.27 would become new paragraph (a), andwould apply to all transactions that it currently applies to, except thoseset forth in new paragraph (b).Amendment No. 5 would add new paragraph (b), which would apply only tocertain multiple currency transactions in casinos. Specifically, if theamount of a cash buy in, purchase of chips, or cash bet at a casino wouldcause all of a customer's cash in transactions to be treated as a singletransaction because the casino obtains the knowledge described in proposedandSection; 103.22(a)(2)(iii) solely pursuant to the casino's books, records,computer information, etc., the casino would be required to verify andrecord the identifying information described in new paragraph (a) (i.e.,name, address, social security number, etc.). However, unlike the requirementin new paragraph (a) to verify and record the information ``before concluding''the transaction, this requirement would be to verify and record the information``within a reasonable period of time after'' the casino acquires the knowledgethat the multiple transactions must be treated as a single one. This requirementfurther provides that the information which is to be verified and recordedis that which is ``then reasonably available.'' Customer information wouldbe deemed reasonably available if the customer is reasonably available.Amendment No. 5 advises that special recordkeeping requirements (as setforth in Amendment No. 15, below) are imposed when paragraph (b) is applicable.It is emphasized that this requirement is limited to the transactions particularlydescribed. Therefore, all other cash in transactions that occur at areasother than the gaming floor, such as the so-called cage, would be subjectto the requirement of new paragraph (a) that the customer's informationbe obtained and verified ``before concluding'' such transactions. Also,the currency transaction that triggers the over-$10,000 reporting thresholdof andSection; 103.22(a)(2), thereby making proposed andSection; 103.27(a)(b)applicable, can only be a buy in, chip or token purchase, or cash bet.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8</ITAG>Nine amendments and additions are proposed to the recordkeeping requirementsfound in andSection; 103.36. Amendments No. 6 and No. 7 would require that,with respect to each deposit of funds, account opened, and line of creditextended, a casino record the name and address of the person involved,in addition to the person's social security number, which is currentlyrequired in paragraph (a). Treasury finds a valid law enforcement purposein maintaining such additional information, in that it responds to theproblem of customers providing false social security numbers. Moreover,Treasury finds this requirement no more burdensome than obtaining socialsecurity numbers.Paragraph (a) is further modified by Amendment No. 8, which would requirethat the name and address of the person to be recorded pursuant to AmendmentsNo. 6 and No. 7 be verified in the same manner that such information iscurrently required to be verified pursuant to andSection; 103.27. Verificationin these instances is believed necessary because of the very few opportunitiesavailable to obtain verification. Having such information on hand wouldaid in ascertaining complete and correct information when reports are requiredbecause of the operation of Amendment No. 3, above. Moreover, Treasurysees this requirement as no more burdensome than requiring the obtainingof social security numbers. Finally, this requirement helps assure thatthe list described in current paragraph (a) contains accurate information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 9</ITAG>Amendments No. 9 through No. 12 describe additional records that casinoswould be required to make and retain under andSection; 103.36(b). AmendmentNo. 9 would require, under new andSection; 103.36(b)(9), a record of eachperson who has bought in at, bet, or purchased chips or tokens for, $2,500or more. Treasury recognizes that it is sometimes difficult to ascertainthe point at which a player has bought in at, bet, or purchased chips for,$2,500 or more through a series of transactions. Accordingly, the casinois required to use ``reasonable diligence'' in determining whether the$2,500 threshold for such transactions has been met. The reasonable diligenceconcept takes into account that tracking multiple buy ins, bets, and chipand token purchases at times is subjective and based on approximations.Still, where a player meets the $2,500 threshold through multiple transactionsat a single gaming table, or at several adjacent tables or during a singleplayer rating period, Treasury would expect the requirements of the proposedamendment to be complied with, without exception.The record required by Amendment No. 9 would include the player's name,permanent address, casino account number (which is defined in AmendmentNo. 16, below), and social security or taxpayer identification number;the date, time, and amount of the transactions; and the name or casinolicense number of the casino employee preparing the record. The name andaddress of the person must be verified, as provided in current andSection;103.27. As with current andSection; 103.36(a), a casino that has been unable to securethe social security or taxpayer identification number shall not be deemedto be in violation of the new rule if it has made a reasonable effort tosecure the number and maintains a list containing the verified names andaddresses of those persons from whom the number was not obtained. Thislist must be made available to the Secretary upon request. Recognizing that most large casinos ``rate'' (i.e., monitor the gamingactivity of) players at, or well below, the $2,500 threshold, new andSection;103.36(b)(9) would exempt from its requirements those casinos which do,indeed, rate at least at $2,500, provided the same information as requiredby this new rule is obtained and verified. Treasury views player ratingdocuments, made in the normal course of business, as highly useful as ameans of aggregating multiple currency transactions, to determine whetherthe transactions exceed $10,000 and thus are required to be reported underandSection;103.22(a)(2). (See the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking set forthat 53 FR 11513). Treasury is concerned that casinos which do not rate theirplayers at least at $2,500, or do not rate at all, create no documentsfrom which it might be determined whether reports have been properly filed.Therefore, new andSection; 103.36(b)(9) would require such documentation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 10 </ITAG>Amendment No. 10 would add a requirement that casinos maintain a recordcontaining a list of each customer who is known by an alias, nickname,``AKA'', etc. The list would include the customer's name, aliases, nicknames,etc., permanent address, and social security or taxpayer identificationnumber. Treasury considers such a list to be important, because customerssometimes use more than one name to identify themselves at casinos. Thelist would help in determining whether multiple currency transactions thatoccur by or on behalf of a single person, but under different names, havebeen aggregated as required under andSection; 103.22 (a)(2), and it wouldindicate whether currency transaction reports that are filed under differentnames pertain to a single person or to several persons. The list must bereported to the Secretary or the Commissioner of Internal Revenue uponrequest. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 11</ITAG>In conducting Bank Secrecy Act compliance examinations pursuant to andSection;103.46, the Internal Revenue Service has reported to Treasury that it hasdetected some transactions which had been accounted for as transactionsinvolving various non-currency monetary instruments, e.g., checks or traveler'schecks. However, in these instances, extensive examinations have failedto reveal any business records that are able to identify whether the transactionsin question actually involved non-currency monetary instruments, as opposedto currency. In order to assure that transactions that are accounted for as involvingnon-currency monetary instruments indeed do not involve currency, AmendmentNo. 11 would add new andSection; 103.36(b)(11) to require that a separaterecord be kept chronologically listing transactions of $2,500 or more involvingthe following instruments: Personal checks, business checks, official bankchecks, cashier's checks, third party checks, promissory notes, traveler'schecks, and money orders. The list would include the type of instrument;the time, date, and amount of the transaction; the name of the drawee orissuer of the instrument; the name and address of the customer; all referencenumbers (e.g., casino account number, personal check number, etc.); andthe name or casino license number of the casino employee who conducts themonetary instrument transaction. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 12</ITAG>New andSection;103.36(b)(12), which is proposed in Amendment No. 12, wouldrequire a record of wire transfers into or out of a casino on behalf ofa customer in amounts of $2,500 or more. Each record would list the time,date, and amount of the transaction; the outside place of origination ordestination of the transfer; any device, request, or instruction regardingthe transfer; the name, address, and casino account number (if any) ofthe customer; and the name of casino license number of the casino employeewho conducted the transaction.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments No. 13 and No. 14</ITAG>Amendments No. 13 and No. 14 respectively would add new andSection;andSection;103.36(b)(13)and 103.36(b)(14). Section 103.36(b)(13) would require casinos to retaina copy of its compliance program (described in Amendment No. 16, below).Section 103.36(b)(14) would require casinos to retain the records madethrough the operation of the denominational imprest system or the systemprovided when the denominational imprest system is exempted (also describedin Amendment No. 16, below).<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 15</ITAG>Amendment No. 15 would add new andSection;103.36(b)(15), which was referredto in the discussion of Amendment No. 5, above. Under this proposed rule,every casino would be required to make a record that contains a list ofeach person which it could not identify solely as a result of the lag timethat occurs between the time information is posted, logged in, inputtedinto a computer, etc., and the time it is ordinarily readable.The interplay between this amendment and Amendment No. 5 is illustratedas follows. Assume that several casino employees at various times in agaming day input the amounts of several buy ins of a player into the casino'scomputer system, which is capable of aggregating the amounts of multipletransactions and displaying the total. (Using computers to aid in BankSecrecy Act compliance is discussed in Amendment No. 16, below). The playerleaves the casino before the computer aggregates these transactions, whichtogether exceed $10,000, and the displays the total on the employee's computerscreen. If a reasonable period of time elapses before a casino employeehas knowledge through the computer that the buy ins have exceeded $10,000,and the casino has not already obtained or verified the name and addressunder andSection;103.27(a), compliance with Amendment No. 5 would operateto relieve the casino of civil or criminal liability resulting from thecasino's inability to obtain identifying information in a timely manner.Under Amendment No. 15, the casino would be required to include the playeron the special list. The list also would have to include any informationthat the casino has on the player (e.g., the player's nickname or address),the specific information that was not verified or recorded, and the time,date, and amount of the transaction or transactions that caused the operationof new andSection;103.27(b)(2). For purposes of these amendments, informationwhich is available includes information which may be derived through casinoaccounts, prior reports filed on the same person pursuant to andSection;103.22(a),etc. For an ongoing duty imposed on casinos to obtain information whichis required to be obtained and retained, but is not, see Amendment No.16, below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment No. 16</ITAG>Amendment No. 16 would add new andSection;103.54, titled ``Special rulesfor casinos.'' In proposed paragraph (a) thereof, the development and implementationof internal programs to assure and monitor compliance with the Bank SecrecyAct and regulations thereunder would be mandated. The compliance programswould require, at a minimum, a system of internal controls to assure ongoingcompliance, independent internal or external testing for compliance, trainingof casino personnel, the designation of an individual or individuals toassume the responsibility of day-to-day compliance, and the use of allinformation that is available to determine (a) at that point in time identifyinginformation on a person must be obtained or verified, (b) when multiplecurrency transactions shall be treated as a single transaction under andSection;103.22(a)(2),and (c) whether any records required under the regulations must be madeand retained. Additionally, the compliance programs for casinos which haveautomated data processing systems would have to provide for the developmentand use of computer programs to help assure Bank Secrecy Act compliance.The compliance programs would have to be in effect not later than 60 daysafter publication of the final rule.Treasury's authority to require Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs canbe found at section 5318(a)(2) of title 31 of the United States Code. Thefirst four requirements of the compliance programs are the same as thosecontained in the mandatory compliance programs of other financial institutionsfor Bank Secrecy Act purposes. <T3>See,</T3> eg., 12 CFR 21.21 and 12 CFR 208.14. The fifth requirementis imposed because some casinos have filed the reports required by andSection;103.22(a)with incomplete information, even though complete information had beenmaintained in the casinos' computer systems; have failed to treat multiplecurrency transactions as a single one, even though player rating forms,when read together, showed that players had bought in for more than $10,000in cash during a single gaming day; and have failed to maintain completerecords under andSection;103.36(b).The sixth requirement merely requires casinos to use their automated dataprocessing systems to their fullest extent to help assure compliance. Itis stressed that this requirement is meant for casinos which have suchsystems in place and use them in the normal course of business. While casinosare not required to purchase or rent automated data processing systemsfor the sole purpose of enhancing their compliance with the Act and regulations,if they have a system in place that permits them to aggregate transactions,they must use that system for purposes of complying with the Act. New andSection; 103.54(a) concludes with the admonition that the developmentand implementation of compliance programs, standing alone, will not beconsidered a defense to any criminal or civil action under the Bank SecrecyAct or the regulations thereunder. Amendment No. 16 would also add new andSection; 103.54(b) to require eachcasino to use a ``denominational imprest system'' to account for certaintransactions. As one facet of the denominational imprest system, each casinoemployee who engages in chip or currency transactions, with customers,other than those which occur at the gaming tables, would be responsiblefor a currency or a currency and chip inventory of a recorded dollar valueand denominational composition at the beginning of his or her employmentshift. The inventory at the end of the employment shift must also be recordedby dollar value and denominational composition. Each transaction which involves the inventory must be accounted for chronologicallyand be recorded. The transactions would include those with another areaof the casino, such as a ``chip bank'', or with a customer, such as a paymentof credit with chips. The record will include the amounts involved, thedenominations of currency involved, and a brief description of the transaction(e.g., ``redemption of chips for one $50 bill and two $20 bills''). Papertape, such as bank teller tape, can constitute the record. Also, the casinomay develop a code to help expedite each transaction. By using a code,the casino can apply symbols, different colors of ink, etc., to describevarious transactions. When a transaction with a customer involves $2,500 or more in currency,the casino would also be required to secure, verify, and record certainidentifying information, including social security number or taxpayer identificationnumber. If such number cannot be obtained, the casino will not be deemedto be in violation of the rule, provided that it has made a reasonableeffort to secure the number and maintains a list, made available to theSecretary upon request, of those persons from whom it was unable to obtainthe number. The name or casino license number of the employee conductingthe transaction must also be recorded. The requirement to account for customer currency or chip transactions througha denominational imprest system may be exempted by the Secretary. In orderto obtain an exemption, a casino must certify to the Secretary that allof its currency and chip transactions (other than those occurring at thegaming tables) in amounts greater than $10,000 occur only at one or morestations, such as a cashier's window in the cage; that all of its currencyand chip transactions in amounts between $2,500 and $10,000 inclusive occuronly at one or more other stations and that certain information is recordedand verified at those stations; and that the stations handle no other transactions.The denominational imprest system is necessary to assure that transactionsaccounted for as non-currency (e.g., chip transactions) are not currencytransactions and to provide an audit trail presently not available forcage transactions. While significantly new requirements would be imposedfor customer transactions, the added burden for internal transactions wouldbe insignificant. Casinos already determine the denominational compositionof the currency involved in the internal transactions covered by the proposedrule. The rule merely requires that a record be made of the denominationalcomposition. The denominational imprest system is similar to that used in banks, wherea record is made of each transaction. Again, as with many banks, casinosmay use a ``teller tape'' as the required record for each customer transactioncovered by the rule. The system used by banks has proved to be greatlybeneficial for Bank Secrecy Act enforcement purposes. Amendment No. 16 would add new andSection; 103.54(c) to define five termswhich are used in the regulations and pertain to casinos. ``Gaming day''would be defined to mean essentially the normal business day of a casino.Moreover, no casino would be permitted to maintain separate gaming daysfor its various divisions, e.g., having a 24-hour period for cage transactionswhich is not the same period for gaming table transactions. ``Customer''is all-inclusive and refers to each person involved in a transaction witha casino, regardless of whether that person engages in the casino's gamingactivity. ``Business year'' means the taxable year, for purposes of subtitleA of title 26 of the United States Code, of the casino. ``Machine-readable''means capable of being read by an automated data processing system. ``Casinoaccount number'' includes all numbers by which a casino identifies a customer.Finally, paragraph (d), alluded to in the discussion of Amendment No. 15above, would also be added to new andSection; 103.54. The new rule wouldplace casinos under an ongoing duty to secure the missing information containedin the list prescribed by proposed andSection; 103.36(b)(15). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This proposed rule, if adopted, would not be a major rule for purposesof Executive Order 12291. It is not anticipateda to have an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more. It will not result in a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individuals industries, Federal, state,or local government agencies, or geographic regions. It will not have anysignificant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or foreign markets.
