Patton Jr., president and chief executive officer, said.    In the year-earlier quarter, the company posted a net loss of $2.3 million on revenues of $75.7 million. Those results included an extraordinary charge of $7.8 million linked to the early retirement of debt.    For the fiscal year, Mr. Patton said the maker and marketer of business computers and information processing systems, expects net to more than double to $23.5 million to $24 million, or $1.56 to $1.58 a share, on revenue of $320 million to $321 million.    The results include a third-quarter gain from a tax-loss carry-forward of $989,000.    In the previous year, the company reported net of $9.1 million, or 53 cents a share, on revenue of $281 million. Those results included the fourth-quarter charge of $7.8 million linked to the early retirement of debt.    Mr. Patton said in an interview that the increased revenue and income are due to continued growth in sales of computer hardware and software targeted at specific industries. MAI Basic Four sharply increased its sales and marketing staff to 1,367 from 1,143 the previous year. The company also began marketing 60 new hardware and software products and three new computer systems.    MAI Basic Four acquired more than 20 companies in fiscal 1987. The companies develop software, distribute computer systems and provide computer maintenance services. Mr. Patton said he expects those companies to provide more than $25 million in revenues in the next fiscal year.    Mr. Patton said sales were particularly strong in the company's computer systems geared for the manufacturing, wholesale distribution, phone products and health care industries. Customer orders for industry-specific systems accounted for 79% of the company's orders in the most recent year, up from 67% the previous year.    Total orders during 1987 increased by 22%, Mr. Patton said. The company has an order backlog that is 18% to 20% higher than it was a year ago, he added.    Mr. Patton said the company expects to introduce and deliver more than 60 new products in fiscal 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
