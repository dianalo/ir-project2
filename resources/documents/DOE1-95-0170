Within both regions the mean void fractions areessentially constant along the height and only dependent on flow parameters,i.e. superficial gas velocities and solid rate. In particular the voidfraction in the dense region is even independent of the solid rate andvaries only slightly with the superficial gas velocity. The bed height,taken as the transition between dense and dilute regions, is clearlyinfluenced both by flow parameters and flow conditions in the gas entrancesection. This leaves the latter as a powerful tool for variations insolid hold-up under otherwise constant gas velocities and solid rates.Upward moving instabilities were detected within the dense region ofthe bed with a wave speed being fairly constant over a wide range offlow parameters. There is a clear similarity to phenomena in sluggingfluidized beds. The presented results suggest that the solid in the denseregions of high-velocity fluidized beds is present in three differentforms; fairly stagnant in a dense annulus region, very dilute in a coreregion and in the form of waves rolling upward between the core and denseannulus.</TEXT></DOC>
