As cloud shadowspass over such PV systems, their generation varies with the incidentsolar radiation (insolation), and the electric utility must follow thesechanges with its own generators, similar to how it now follows continuouschanges in electrical loads. A two-dimensional simulation of time-varyingincident solar radiation was developed and used to study the effect ofmoving cloud shadows on the Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO)electric utility system, to which the PV generator were connected. Theinsolation simulation was first combined with a distribution feeder modelto estimate possible changes in PV generation over several time periods.The insolation and feeder models were then used to provide data to thePSO power-flow simulation to estimate the effects on the PSO system.During the worst cumulus cloud pattern at peak-solar-radiation times,PSO will begin to see significant effects from the dispersed PV generationwhen PV installed penetration in southeast Tulsa reaches approximately15% (when PV represents approximately 15% of the installed generationin southeast Tulsa.</TEXT></DOC>
