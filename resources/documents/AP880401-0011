Among the units being ordered south is an Army aviation taskforce that includes helicopter gunships.   The Pentagon announced the decision to increase the number oftroops in Panama late Friday evening ``in view of the growingunrest and tension'' in that country. The deployments are to beginTuesday and be completed by April 8.   The move was recommended by Adm. William Crowe, the chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, and approved by Defense Secretary FrankC. Carlucci and President Reagan, the Pentagon said.   Administration officials who demanded anonymity said the StateDepartment had wanted to send even more troops to Panama, but thatCarlucci had counseled caution.   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions thatSecretaru of State George Shultz and his assistant, Elliott Abrams,had proposed a series of stronger actions, including kidnappingPanamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to bring him to theUnited States for trial, landing more than 3,000 troops in Panamain a show of force, and using the CIA to organize a military coup.   The newspaper reported that the proposals had been advanced athigh-level meetings, and that the kidnapping plan, which startledother officials, had been shelved as unworkable.   But the idea of fomenting a coup remained under consideration,the Times said. The CIA has prepared a draft presidentialauthorization for limited covert action against Noriega, thenewspaper reported.   CBS News also reported Friday night that the administration was``considering a plan to overthrow'' Noriega suggested by the StateDepartment earlier this week. The plan would require thedispatching of two infantry brigades, or 8,000 combat troops, intoPanama, the network said.   The sources who spoke to The Associated Press refused to saywhether the State Department wanted extra troops in Panama to mounta military operation to topple Noriega, or rather thought there wasmore of a threat to Americans in the country than defenseofficials. A State Department spokesman had no comment on the CBSreport.   There are already more than 10,000 U.S. troops in Panama.   ``The instability of the current situation in Panama; theheavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the situation, andthe potential for increased threats to U.S. citizens and interestsin Panama make this deployment essential at this time to ensure thecontinued safety of U.S. personnel and facilities,'' the Pentagonsaid in a statement.   The deployment should not be read as portending ``some kind ofmilitary action on the part of the United States,'' the Pentagonadded.   The decision to send the extra troops comes just one week afterthe Defense Department completed a buildup that had already doubledthe number of security personnel guarding military bases in Panama.It also comes four days after Panamanian troops marched on a PanamaCity hotel, confiscating the tapes of four U.S. television networksand briefly detaining several American journalists.   The Defense Department's prepared statement did not elaborate onwho or what would be protected. But a ranking Pentagon officialsaid the troops ``will not be restricted to providing security atour bases.''   ``They will be able to go where they are needed to protectAmericans,'' said the official, who requested anonymity.   ``This action is consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty and isa reasonable and prudent effort to further safeguard the canal andU.S. lives, property and interests in the area,'' the Pentagon'sstatement said.   The units being sent to Panama include an Army battalion ofmilitary police; a reinforced company of Marines; three Air ForceAir Base Ground Defense Units; two additional guard dog squads andan Army aviation task force, the Pentagon said.   The aviation unit will include seven AH-1 Cobra helicoptergunships along with 15 UH-60 Blackhawk transports and four OH-58Kiowa observation copters, the Pentagon said.   ``The aircraft are to provide rapid transportation and highlymobile protection for the security forces if necessary,'' thePentagon said.   The U.S. Southern Command, which has its headquarters in Panama,had about 600 security personnel among the 10,000 servicemenassigned to it before the United States stepped up its campaignlast month to oust Noriega.   Over a 10-day period that ended on March 24, the Pentagondispatched another 670 security personnel to Panama for the statedpurpose of protecting military facilities.   Besides the servicemen assigned to the Southern Command, thereare about 13,000 military dependents in Panama along with another1,300 U.S. employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their 2,600dependents.   The Defense Department said the Army MPs would be drawn fromFort Meade, Md., and Fort Bragg, N.C., while the Army helicopterunit would come from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,Calif.   The Marine company will be dispatched from Camp Lejeune, N.C.The Pentagon said it was not prepared Friday to say where the AirForce ground defense units would deploy from.</TEXT></DOC>
