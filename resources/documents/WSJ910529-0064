Wrigley Jr. Co. makes more than14,000 tons of a rubbery compound with ingredients found alsoin paint, underwear-elastic and petrochemicals. Machines rollout blobs of the stuff, slice it into thin sticks and sheatheit in foil wrap.   Chewing gum is a lucrative business, Wrigley's onlybusiness. Indeed, Wrigley dominates the world of chewing gummore thoroughly than Coca-Cola Co. looms over soft drinks.Wrigley has a 48% share of a $2.4 billion U.S. retail market,nearly twice that of Warner-Lambert Co., its biggestcompetitor (Trident, Dentyne). And it soundly beats back thecompetitive threat from consumer-goods powerhouse RJR NabiscoInc. (Beech-Nut, Care Free).</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We get a lot of letters about brands that we don't evenmake because people assume we make all chewing gum,&quot; saysWilliam Piet, Wrigley's corporate secretary.   Yet in selling gum, Wrigley is a throwback to the timebefore micro-marketing. It continues to run televisionadvertising campaigns with themes that have been around sinceEisenhower. It seldom resorts to sweepstakes or othergimmicks to promote its brands. Even so, Doublemint remainsparamount among gum buyers world-wide, and Juicy Fruit,Spearmint, Extra, Freedent, Big Red and Hubba Bubba areholding their own.   &quot;The advertising community bad-mouths Wrigley,&quot; says AlReis, a marketing consultant in Greenwich, Conn. &quot;But whatWrigley does is very successful.&quot;   Wrigley is flourishing in the recession. In the firstquarter, its net earnings rose 6%, to $31.7 million, thanksto a &quot;modest&quot; rise in shipments of chewing gum. Gum salesrarely are hurt by problems in the wider world.   Atypically, Wrigley almost always maintains or increasesad spending in tough times. One reason: gum is such animpulse purchase that Wrigley figures it can't afford tobecome less visible. Last year, it spent about $158 millionon advertising, up from $134 million in 1989. Sales figuresfor Doublemint, first sold in 1914, aren't available becausethe company doesn't break down sales by brand.   Says one company director: &quot;The only thing {Wrigley} wouldconsider as a new venture is something else in the gumbusiness.&quot;   Single-mindedness has paid off for the Wrigley family andthe now-public company it founded. The business is run from awedding cake-shaped headquarters -- the famous WrigleyBuilding -- overlooking the fur and jewelry boutiques ofChicago's Michigan Avenue. The current president and chiefexecutive officer is William Wrigley, 58 years old and thegrandson of the company's founder. His son, William WrigleyJr., 27, is being groomed to succeed him. Recently, young Mr.Wrigley was elected by the board to the dual posts of vicepresident and assistant to the president, doubling hispleasure no doubt.   The Wrigley family owns 37% of the company's stock.William Wrigley, who is said to be worth more than $500million, also owns a stable of Arabian horses. The Wrigleyshave an estate where they can get away from it all calledWychwood, in Lake Geneva, Wis., and another on Santa CatalinaIsland, off the California coast.   The Wrigleys don't care for publicity, in part perhapsbecause of the decades of press criticism they endured asowners of the Chicago Cubs baseball franchise. After theysold the perennially losing Cubs and Wrigley Field to TribuneCo. in 1981, Chicago magazine commented that selling the Cubswas the biggest contribution the Wrigleys had ever made tothe city.   But in gum, Wrigley plays to win, and it isn't shy. It hasbeen a fierce competitor ever since founder William WrigleyJr. refused to join the so-called chewing gum trust -- amerger of the industry's six largest companies in 1899 -- anddecided to compete on his own. The company was one of thefirst to offer premiums -- razors, lamps and such -- tomerchants as an inducement to sell Wrigley's. In 1915, itmailed a stick of gum to everyone listed in U.S. phone books.   Wrigley hit a bad patch in the late 1970s, when its marketshare declined 35% over a four-year period as competitorsbegan promoting sugar-free gums, but it made a comeback withExtra, introduced in 1984 and pushed extra hard.   &quot;We had a very late start, and the key was formulatingwhat we felt was a superior product,&quot; says Ronald Cox,Wrigley's group vice president for marketing. The more than$30 million Wrigley spent launching Extra was the most it hadever spent on a new brand. By 1989, Extra had become theindustry's best-selling sugarless gum.   Wrigley has also prospered from making something of ascience of the relationship between retail price and thenumber of sticks in a pack. Its PlenTpak of 17 sticks makesup the bulk of Wrigley sales, but little things mean a lot.After a 25-cent pack of five sticks was reintroduced in 1987(following two years of study and 15 years of not offering afive-stick pack), Wrigley's single-pack sales increased, andmarket share rose about 4%. Older gum chewers will recallwhen the five-stick pack cost a nickel, which it did for morethan 60 years, until 1960.   Wrigley also has the industry's most effectivedistribution network, capable of shipping more than a millionpounds of chewing gum a day. And to stay ubiquitous, Wrigleyhas its telephone sales people contact most wholesalers atleast once a week. That way, nobody ever runs out of JuicyFruit.   But the Wrigley style is still ridiculed. Madison Avenuehooted in the '50s when the Doublemint twins made the scene.They were a hokey concept, people said, but in their fourthdecade, they continue to move the merchandise.   &quot;The twins mnemonic still evokes a response fromconsumers,&quot; says Eric Harkna, president of BBDO-Chicago,Wrigley's ad agency. (The agency recently surprised MadisonAvenue with a new campaign to encourage smokers to chew gumwhere smoking is prohibited.)   Wrigley is determined to maintain a conservative andwholesome image. Accordingly, it won't advertise on TV showsit thinks are &quot;risque or offensive.&quot;   There was one misstep.   In 1989, Wrigley was inundated with letters from angrynurses when one of its commercials appeared on a short-livedABC show called &quot;Nightingales,&quot; a series criticized by someas demeaning and sexist. In response, William Wrigley sent apersonal note to everyone who wrote in, promising to neveradvertise on the show again.   Mr. Wrigley answers his own phone, but he declined to beinterviewed for this story. He has avoided the limelight eversince his scandalous divorce from his second wife. In 1976,according to press accounts, his wife, Joan, sued toinvalidate a prenuptial agreement; he in turn filed for anannulment of the marriage; and she then sued for divorce. Thecase dragged on for six years and included 12 lawsuitsaltogether, in two states. The back and forth played like asoap opera in the Chicago papers, with charges ofgold-digging against her, adultery against him, and withwords from Mrs. Wrigley about how much she hated living in ahouse where everything was monogrammed W. The marriageultimately was annulled after Mr. Wrigley's attorneysdiscovered in Alabama that Joan Wrigley had two previousquickie divorces and was still legally married to her secondhusband. So it wasn't just the Chicago Cubs that made Mr.Wrigley publicity shy.   Mr. Wrigley, who studied psychology at Yale, oversees apaternalistic corporate culture (Wrigley's 5,700 workers geta cash bonus each year of up to 15% of their gross pay) and asecretive manufacturing operation. Wrigley's sprawlingred-brick compound in southwest Chicago, one of the 13 gumfactories it operates throughout the world, is guarded bysecurity cameras and tall barbed-wire gates. Were it not fora small, brass nameplate and the smell of mint hanging in theair, the factory would be a complete mystery in a mixed-useneighborhood of warehouses and modest old houses. Uniformedsecurity guards patrol the compound in Jeeps. Their &quot;GUM&quot;license plates are another clue to what goes on here.   Chewing gum is whipped up like a big batch of bread, ingiant mixers that hold a ton of ingredients. Then it isrolled into sheets, chilled and cut into slices. In the pastfive years, Wrigley says, it has upgraded its equipment.Thanks to faster wrapper machines and such, it has increasedproductivity more than 30% over competitors. But it won'tshow its new gizmos to people who don't work there. And it isso worried about its secrets that it doesn't get patents forinnovations that others might copy. It is best that nobodyelse knows anything about them at all, Wrigley figures.   The major ingredient in chewing gum is always identifiedon the pack simply as gum base and can include any of about45 natural and synthetic flavors, softeners and other stuff.It was once made primarily from sap taken from chicle treesin the Yucatan peninsula. But as that process became tooexpensive during World War II, gum makers developed syntheticmaterials, with ingredients that include butadiene-styrenerubber, a hydrocarbon refined from crude oil; polyvinylacetate, used as an adhesive in some paints; and petroleumwax.   As unappetizing as some of those things might sound, theyall have been approved as safe by the Food and DrugAdministration. Wrigley also uses natural latexes such assorva and jelutong, which still are transported out of jungleareas of Central and South America by canoe.   Over the years, Wrigley has shied away from overt assaultson the biggest impediment to gum sales: social stigma. Itisn't just schoolteachers and pedestrians who hate chewinggum. &quot;People in certain social groups see it as a symbol ofpeople they find repulsive,&quot; says Lynn Kahle, a psychologistand chairman of the marketing department at the University ofOregon.   In the latest edition of &quot;Etiquette,&quot; now written by EmilyPost's granddaughter-inlaw, Elizabeth, a short section on gumchewing begins: &quot;It is hard to understand why so manyotherwise attractive people totally destroy their appearanceby chewing gum like a cow chewing a cud.&quot; The columnist MissManners advises that &quot;Gum may be chewed in the presence ofothers only when it is safe to assume that they will not beoffended. It is only safe to assume that others will not beoffended if they are also chewing gum.&quot;   Convincing people that it is all right to chew gum is a&quot;hard thing to deal with,&quot; says Mr. Cox, the Wrigleymarketing executive. The company tried, albeit obliquely, inits recent &quot;Piece of America&quot; campaign, which showedotherwise respectable people chewing gum in public. Wrigleythinks it eased minds.   Wrigley says chewing gum aids digestion, sweetens breath,keeps the chewer alert and even helps clean teeth, despitewhat dentists used to tell patients.   Sociologists say gum also makes people feel tough. Chewingand popping are a major statement in some circles, saysMichael Solomon, a life-styles expert at Rutgers University.&quot;People chew gum and, in an inexpensive and harmless way,they become a James Dean kind of rebel.&quot;   No such boasts make it into Wrigley's ad copy. &quot;The truthis they don't have all that much to sell,&quot; says Leo Shapiro,a Chicago-based marketing consultant. &quot;The key to theiradvertising is to refresh their name in the mind of consumerswithout saying anything.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
