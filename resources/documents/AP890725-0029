Majority Leader George J. Mitchell made clear Monday he plans torevamp the measure, telling reporters he has no intention of makingsponsorship of failed clean air legislation his ``life's work.''   While Mitchell _ chief sponsor of clean air measures for adecade _ was largely critical of the legislation, the powerfulchairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee gave Bush'slegislation a lukewarm endorsement.   At the first congressional hearing on the legislation, Energyand Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., called the proposalthe ``best vehicle'' for breaking a decade-long clean airstalemate. He lashed out at ``Detroit-bashing'' critics who believethe bill is too soft on automakers.   Dingell, while praising the overall pollution reduction he saidthe bill would achieve, warned he has reservations about severalparts of the proposal and cautioned that the measure could ``havedevastating effects'' on the auto industry and its workers.   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly,at the same hearing, asked members of the House Energy and Commerceenvironment subcommittee to support the legislation.   Reilly said the bill will ``make the 1990s the clean airdecade'' and insisted it will force industry to rid the skies ofpollution while taking into account the cost to business ofreducing acid rain, ozone smog and airborne toxic chemicals.   He said the legislation also will give industry incentives tocut pollution by giving business the flexibility to work outalternatives and trade ``credits'' for achieving more cleanup thanrequired.   However, Mitchell said Bush ``avoided virtually every toughchoice'' in his legislation and gave too much discretion to the EPAadministrator to enforce the law.   Mitchell said language to let automakers meet new anti-pollutionrequirements by averaging auto emissions represents a major retreatfrom current law. Averaging would allow some cars to exceed newanti-pollution standards while other vehicles would meet them withroom to spare.   The averaging would cause confusion in emissions testing,Mitchell said, because it would be nearly impossible to tellwhether a particular car should pass.   Mitchell called the Bush bill ``especially weak'' on nitrogenoxides, the second main ingredient of acid rain that harms lakesand streams.   ``Incredibly, the president proposes to permit increases in(nitrogen oxide) emissions,'' Mitchell said, because Bush wouldreduce nitrogen oxides by 2 million tons by the year 2000, whileemissions of the substance are expected to grow by 3 million tonsin the same period.   The senator, however, praised Bush's plan to reduce sulfurdioxide emissions by 10 million tons by 2000, compared with 1980levels. Sulfur dioxide is the major acid rain component.   Mitchell said it was ``most disturbing'' that the cleanup oftoxic chemicals under Bush's plan would take into account the costto industry when protecting Americans' health.   He attacked the so-called ``unreasonable risk'' health standard,in which economists would perform a ``cost-benefit analysisestimating how much a human life is worth and how many must be atrisk before additional control of toxic air pollutants iswarranted.''   Dingell said he had several other reservations about the bill,including:   _Provisions that fail to give states credit for past reductionsof sulfur dioxide.   _The failure to protect between 20,000 and 50,000 jobs in thesoft coal and related industries, which could result from newrequirements on utilities.   _A cap on sulfur dioxide emissions after the year 2000, which hesaid could ``tilt in favor of some fuel to the detriment of coal.''</TEXT></DOC>
