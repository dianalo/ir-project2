StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar slipped lower in quiet foreign exchange dealings, with many market participants idle while awaiting today's report on October U.S. merchandise trade.    The dollar's decline occurred entirely in Asian trading yesterday, as dealers there sold the U.S. currency in anticipation of a poor showing by the U.S. in its October trade balance, and to square positions ahead of the news. The dollar firmed the rest of the day but remained below Tuesday's levels. A bearish outlook for the dollar by Salomon Brothers economist Henry Kaufman late in the day knocked the U.S. currency back near some of its intraday lows as the North American trading day ended and Australian and New Zealand markets opened.    Today's trade report remains the larger factor in the dollar's outlook. Dealers generally expect the Commerce Department report to show that the U.S. trade gap widened from the $14.1 billion deficit in September. Estimates for the September deficit range from $13.5 billion to $17 billion.    &quot;We're looking toward this figure to give us direction for the rest of the month. It'll be the last hope for something dramatic to happen this year,&quot; said John W. Baker, vice president and chief foreign-exchange trader at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co., New York.    Despite the prevalent view that the trade deficit worsened in October, traders said the market doesn't seem to be positioned in either an oversold or overbought condition to capitalize on any sudden swing by the dollar on the trade news. &quot;Basically the market's going into the trade figures square,&quot; Liliana Nealon, vice president of foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland, New York, said. &quot;The market is generally expecting a bad number, but the market isn't going to bet on it because we've been wrong so often before,&quot; she said.    Very late in the afternoon in New York, the report by Mr. Kaufman undercut some of the dollar's recovery from its early intraday lows. The report predicted that the dollar would fall below 120 Japanese yen and 1.5 West German marks in 1988.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 132.15 yen, down from 132.63 Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 1.6605 marks, from 1.6640. The British pound climbed to $1.8052, from $1.7993.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1 an ounce to $484.50 in light trading. The estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $484.45 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, Dec. 9, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
