 Whether it is because people are content with Illustrator'88, SuperPaint, MacDraw 2.0 and FreeHand, or because we're between productcycles on drawing programs, most of the Macintosh graphics news at theConference was in gray-scale image editing, &quot;production tools&quot; for the Macand color software.andM;There are several factors contributing to the surge in retouching software.andO;One is the new gray-scale scanners that are becoming available.andP;  They offerbetter resolution at prices well under $6,000.andP;  Another is the advent ofcolor separation software for Macs and PCs.andP;  With that has come moreexperimentation with digital halftoning from a desktop computer.andP;  And a thirdis the proliferation of output alternatives, from the Intel VisualEdgegray-scale imaging board to the raft of PostScript typesetters.andM;Another interesting trend is the addition of vector drawing tools into pixelediting programs.andP;  These offer users the ability to annotate images withlines, objects or even text, such as labels.andM;Although few programs do so, the best means of handling both vector andraster data in the same picture is to offer separate layers that allow, forexample, the annotations to be modified without affecting the underlyingimage.andP;  In general, the vector tools of the raster image editors are veryprimitive.andP;  No vendor in the desktop market has yet demonstrated mastery ofboth vector and raster image editing.andM;Agfa improves Focus, softwareandM;While it was boosting its Focus scanner line to 256 gray levels, Agfa alsoenhanced the Focus's symbiotic partner, the MC View Plus scanning and editingsoftware.andP;  Version 2.0 of MC View Plus, shown with the Focus S800GSE in theAgfa Compugraphic booth, bolsters its basic gray-scale editing tools with awealth of nifty new processing features.andM;Given the output device and the screen resolution, the program calculates themaximum number of printable gray levels.andP;  An &quot;equalize&quot; function identifiesthe most common gray levels and increases the contrast between them.andP;  Theprogram offers several standard tonal curves, such as one ranging from 5% to95%.andM;One addition that caught our eye is the ability to calibrate a PostScriptoutput device.andP;  The user prints a sample page, then scans it into MC ViewPlus 2.0 with the Focus S800GSE; the software uses its densitometer tool toadjust automatically the output device's gray transfer curve based on levelsin the sample output.andM;The software also optimizes the image for reproduction in any of five rangesof output screens, and it has seven selectable ways to compensate fordeficiencies in the original image (see illustration).andP;  The user can now alsoscan directly to disk.andM;MC View Plus 2.0 runs on a Mac Plus or better with at least 1 MB of memory.andO;It was released last month for $595 (the same price as version 1.0).andM;Astral going to the MacandM;Astral burst on the scene a little over a year ago with Picture Publisher,the first gray-scale image editing program for the PC that gave Mac programssome competition.andP;  Now that it has established itself as a front-runner,Astral's task is to keep up the pace.andP;  It introduced its next release, 2.0,and announced that it will port Picture Publisher to the Macintosh.andM;The new release focuses on adding global enhancement tools that should provebeneficial in preparing images for print, not just for retouching.andP;  It alsosports a new user interface in which the pull-down menus are replaced byicons and tool palettes that will enable Astral to develop foreign languageversions of its product.andM;The new global tools include support for different screen resolutions (up to640 X 640); rotation in single-degree increments; nine clipboards for movingimages from one picture to another; support for the Intel VisualEdge printercard; and a &quot;smart sizing&quot; feature that automatically interpolates the dataif an image is enlarged.andM;Among the most important new features is a more flexible masking tool.andP;  Masksmay now be used to protect the painting area, and many functions may beapplied to just the mask areas rather than to the entire image.andP;  Gray tintsmay be applied to masks or to any circular or rectangular area.andM;Astral also has added a graph of the gray map with five points that may bemanipulated in order to change the overall tone of the image.andM;Another noteworthy addition is the ability to make adjustments for dot gain.andO;Astral uses a strip of gray tints to make these adjustments, which it callscalibration.andP;  The system does not have built-in values for different outputrequirements, but it does enable the user to reset the output precentages ofany specified gray-value percentage to compensate for dot gain on the pressor copier.andP;  Thus, for example, a 50% gray value might be printed at 47%.andP;  Theuser is advised to employ a densitometer for recording accurate measurementsof the output in conjunction with this feature.andM;Astral showed an early version of its port of Picture Publisher 1.2 to theMac, which should be ready by January 1990.andP;  Given the fact that Letraset andSilicon Beach already have established themselves in this market, Astral isfocusing on production tools, rather than retouching, as its special niche.andO;Printed samples available at the show did not bear out what advantages Astralwill offer, but in our experiences with digital halftoning, there iscertainly room in the market for good image production tools.andP;  Blue Solutionsintroduced a product with a similar focus, which may spur Letraset andSilicon Beach to develop comparable functionality.andM;Picture Publisher is priced at $595.andP;  It runs on any IBM-compatible PC andrequires no special software or hardware to make use of EMS memory.andM;Blue Solutions: dubious debutandM;This was the first chance we had to see PhotoLab, the new gray-scaleimage-enhancement software for the Mac, which we initially covered in ourAugust issue (Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  12).andP;  Since then, Orange Solutions has changedits name to Blue Solutions to avoid confusion with Orange Micro.andM;As we noted in our earlier story, PhotoLab was developed by Kelly Austreng,the developer of Truvel's scanner software.andP;  Austreng's intent is todifferentiate PhotoLab from other Mac image processors by paying attention toproduction problems, rather than by focusing on retouching.andP;  This accountsfor its description as image enhancement, rather than image editing,software.andM;Unfortunately, the demonstration and samples at the show failed tosubstantiate Austreng's claims that PhotoLab is superior to its competitionfor producing images for publication.andP;  The printed samples had beenmisregistered by the printer, and the original image was out of focus, so allwe had to go on was what was on the screen.andM;The ability to apply filters to an entire image is useful, but it is notunique.andP;  Both ImageStudio and Digital Darkroom offer several filters that maybe applied to any selected area, including the entire image.andM;The same point may be made about the ability to rotate an image insingle-degree increments.andP;  Digital Darkroom now offers this as a standardfeature, and ImageStudio offers it as an option.andM;In the first version, to be released this month, PhotoLab will not includetools for local editing of portions of the image.andP;  These are planned asadd-on modules.andM;No adjustments for dot gain or calibration tools are provided, as areavailable with Astral's product.andM;At $495, PhotoLab is less expensive than its counterparts.andP;  However, theadd-on modules have yet to be priced.andM;Despite our concerns, we believe Blue Solutions has the technical expertiseto develop a very competitive product.andP;  We hope to report more conclusivelyon its capabilities after receiving a copy for in-house testing.andM;Migraph offers help to novicesandM;Migraph introduced Touch-Up, a monochrome image scanning and editing programdesigned for less experienced users.andM;Touch-Up operates with most of the current generation of non-gray-scalescanners, including the hand-held scanner from Logitech.andP;  The advantage ofusing it over the scanner manufacturer's software is that you need not exportthe file into an image editing program.andM;Touch-Up provides an assortment of painting tools, including user-definablebrushes.andP;  Interestingly, it offers vector tools for drawing on an image thatmay also be used to define the brush shape.andP;  Brush shapes need not be limitedto rectangles or circles; bezier curves may be edited to create a brush invirtually any shape the user desires.andP;  Areas may be filled withuser-definable patterns.andM;Migraph is working on providing outlined fonts, but these will be specific tothe program.andP;  The company was unable to disclose the source of its fonts, butit was not, we were told, one of the leading vendors.andP;  With only a handful offaces planned, this feature will most likely appeal to users unwilling toinvest in separate font manipulation programs, such as the one fromSoftCraft.andM;Migraph also claims to be the only vendor offering sizing tools that measureimages in pixels.andP;  This feature is meant to ensure that the sized image willrelate to the number of pixels the output device will actually render.andP;  Forexample, you can crop or resize an image so that its pixel count is divisibleby 300, which Migraph claims will &quot;line up the pixels with a 300-dpiprinter.&quot;andM;Touch-Up is scheduled for release next month at a price of $199.andM;XIS shows Gray F/XandM;Having no noteworthy scanner developments, Xerox Imaging Systems usedexisting hardware to show a beta version of Gray F/X, an AT-based &quot;eight-bitelectronic darkroom&quot; that it began shipping last month for $495.andP;  It wasdeveloped by Media Cybernetics and is functionally equivalent to thatcompany's Publisher's Partner (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  11, p. 39).andP;  XIS modifiedthe user interface to make it more &quot;visual&quot; and natural.andM;Multiple windows can be open within Gray F/X.andP;  In addition to basic elementssuch as contrast and lightness controls and paint features, it offers specialeffects such as replace, blur and charcoal.andP;  The user can outline, distort,fill and rotate parts of an image.andP;  Halftoning and histogram functions areavailable.andP;  Images can be saved in TIFF, IMG, PCX, EPS and CUT formats.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
