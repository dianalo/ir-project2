Method: Uranium dioxide powder ormixed oxide powder is compression-molded and oxide fuel pellets are sinteredin a steam stream. Then, the oxide fuel pellets are annealed in an oxidativeatmosphere and the swelling property of the oxide fuel pellets is inspectedbased on the change in the size and the density before and after theannealing. As the oxidative atmosphere during annealing, a gas streamatmosphere from argon and oxygen gas mixture, carbon monoxide and carbondioxide gas mixture or hydrogen or carbon dioxide gas mixture is used.This enables inspection under a normal pressure out of the reactor and,accordingly, can eliminate the requirement for the inspection under ahigh temperature atmosphere in a large scaled device to provide a mucheconomical advantage.
