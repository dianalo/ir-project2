But some observers question whether the moves simply may be superficial.    On Friday, Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities Co. announced major internal reorganizations. Nikko said it will shift 650 employees and Yamaichi said it will move more than 450 in an attempt to create so-called Chinese walls between their securities sales and underwriting departments.    Until now, the division between those areas has been ill-defined. Japanese firms operated on the premise that they provide the best service to clients by being involved in many aspects of a client's business. It is common for employees of a firm's underwriting division to consult with its sales division.    The practice has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, as striking cases of possible insider trading have surfaced. The Ministry of Finance and industry groups have pressured financial institutions to increase internal controls to discourage the misuse of information.    &quot;The Japanese are petrified that another case is going to come out of the closet,&quot; says the head of a major Western brokerage firm in Tokyo. &quot;So they're doing all they can to take measures that will prevent it.&quot;    For its part, Nikko said it will create a new brokerage division, separated from the corporate service division that handles relations with major clients. In addition, Nikko is bringing all its underwriting operations together into a two-section division for domestic and international business. It also is adding staff to monitor customers' trading accounts.    Yamaichi disclosed similar plans, saying it would separate its sales department from its capital-markets division, and create a new planning and information-systems unit. The changes were part of a regular rotation of more than 1,000 employees.    Observers and even some officials at the companies say stanching the free flow of sensitive information at Japan's big securities firms won't be simple. &quot;It's easy just to move around offices; the problem is how to separate the businesses,&quot; says Yukinori Yamamoto, a Nikko official.    Some experts are skeptical that the changes will have much immediate effect. &quot;In large Japanese brokerages, the lines of communications have traditionally been quite close,&quot; says Richard Greer, branch manager of Baring Securities Ltd.'s Tokyo office. &quot;It will take quite a while to untangle them.&quot;    The moves by Nikko and Yamaichi to reduce improper swapping of internal information follow similar, but more limited measures taken during the past several weeks by Japan's other two leading brokerages, Nomura Securities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co.    At the beginning of July, as part of a routine staff shift, Nomura transferred a small group of employees from its investment banking division to reduce the potential for information leaks. A spokesman says Nomura will make further changes in its structure in November. Daiwa has restructured by moving an underwriting division from its home office to a separate building. A spokesman declined to say how many workers were affected.    At the same time, Japanese banks and life insurance companies say they are planning measures to separate their fundraising and investment divisions.    Just how effective these new Chinese walls will be is unclear. While the restructurings are big steps for some of the world's largest brokerage firms, employees in Japanese companies still are encouraged to form strong working relationships that last from posting to posting. Also, the idea that insider trading is wrong is still just starting to sink in here.    But a recent case of possible insider trading has stepped up the pressure on financial institutions to create internal controls. The Tokyo Stock Exchange announced Friday that &quot;a few people&quot; directly involved in negotiations for a tie-up between Nippon Steel Corp. and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co. traded in shares of the companies before the transaction was announced. In announcing results of an investigation, the exchange said 19 Nippon Steel and 15 Sankyo Seiki employees traded in the shares, but may have been trading on rumors, not inside information.    Japan's Diet, or parliament, revised the country's securities law in May, but because it hasn't been put into effect, the Tokyo Stock Exchange will not release the names of the corporate officials involved. Based on current law, it is difficult to prosecute insider-trading offenses.    Before the exchange's announcement, Nippon Steel President Hiroshi Saito formally apologized to Michio Takeuchi, the market's chairman, for irregularities in the company's control of crucial information. Mr. Saito pledged to revise internal controls and submit a report to the exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
