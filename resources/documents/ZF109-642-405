 The market has to be educatedbecause there's very little chance that people will buy this stuff if theydon't know what it really is.andM;Digitizing vs.andP;  compressionandM;This bit of turmoil came to out attention at Comdex, where Chips andTechnologies introduced a video digitizing chip.andP;  The problem is that whenmost people see a motion video image on a computer screen, they don't thinkabout the source of the video.andP;  Whether it's played from a hard disk, aCD-ROM, a videodisc player or whatever, if it's motion video on the computerscreen, people tend to think that it's been compressed.andP;  The concept thatdigitizing is something different from compression is foreign to most people.andM;Figuring out how much compresion is enough compression can drive you crazyquickly because not everyone starts from the same point.andP;  How many bits doesit take to represent an uncompressed frame of video?andP;  To start with, you haveto decide what the image size is.andP;  A full screen could be thought of as 640by 480 pixels, but television uses overscan to ensure that there isn't ablack border at the edges of the screen.andP;  Computers use underscan so thatthere is a border.andP;  Who's right?andP;  How many bits of data are needed torepresent all of the NTSC colors?andP;  Most people say 24 bits--8 bits each ofred, green and blue.andP;  But there are really good-looking 16-bit videodisplays.andP;  And if you choose another color space, such as YUV, you can getdown to 12 bits or so and still have a great-looking image.andM;Imagine, along comes a wonderful new compression technique that is claimed tocompress video by 200:1.andP;  It's much less impressive if the starting point is720-by-512,24 (or more!) bits per pixel than if they started with 640-by-480YUV.andP;  Compression numbers are only meaningful for comparison if the stratingpoints are the same -- and the ending points.andP;  High compression can lookpretty good if the result is a small image, where not much resolution can bedisplayed.andM;The thing that really counts in compression is bits per pixel.andP;  The lowerlimit of image compression (without serios image degradation) is around 1 bitper pixel, before motion compendation.andP;  When you begin to deal with motionvideo, motion compensation allows further compression by comparing successivevideo frames; hence the term &quot;interframe&quot; compression, which DVI, MPEG andothers use.andP;  JPEG, in contrast, deals only with one frame at a time; it's an&quot;intraframe&quot; compression technique.andM;Laserdisc and still video camerasandM;Laserdiscs and still video cameras aren't digital video.andP;  Some have digitalaudio, but the video signal you get from them is analog.andP;  People tend tofigure that if it comes from a disc, it must be digital.andP;  This is wrong.andM;To capture video images from a laserdisc or still video camera into acomputer, you still need a digitizer.andP;  Confusion about this also comes fromthe general confusion about the differences between analog and digitalsignals.andP;  People tend to think that if something can be sent across a wire,it's electronic and there's nothing more that needs to be distinguished.andM;Color depth v. resolutionandM;This business of emerging computers and television would be a lot easier ifpeople stopped and asked a simple question:  &quot;Why does television look betterthan most computer video, when the resolution is lower?&quot;andM;The answer is that good-looking, real-world images are a result of havingmany colors, not high resolution.andP;  Subtle variations in color (or colordepth) makes 3D images look realistic.andP;  But delicate color blends require alot of computer processing.andP;  Without them, color banding and otherfunny-looking artifacts appear in places that should have smooth appearances,such as faces and shadows.andM;High resolution without color depth also creates edge artifacts such asaliasing, in which lines that should be straight come out jagged.andP;  Gettingrid of those jaggies, which is called anti-aliasing, requires great colordepth.andM;Why don't television pictures have jaggies?andP;  The answer isn't entirelyobvious, since television pictures have pixels, just a computer images do.andO;But television cameras are designed to that the pixels overlap slightly whichprevents the sharp lines that result in jaggies and other artifacts ofcomputer-generated video.andM;Access speedandM;Random access is something that most people think they want.andP;  But theyactually just want fast access.andP;  True random access means that you can get toany part of the stored information at the same speed as any other part.andM;One of the arguments against interframe compression is that you have to startwith a key frame to decompress any of the frames derived from it.andP;  That'strue.andP;  But if you have a key frame every 10 frames, which will allow a lot ofmotion compensation, those frames can be decompressed in no more than onethird of a second, since that's the speed at which video plays in real time.andO;Is a third of a second really too long to wait, especially when that's themaximum wait.andP;  Usually, it'll be faster.andM;BandwidthandM;Hardly any customers have any concept of bandwidth, or throughput as we alsocall it.andP;  If they get the idea that it's the size of the pipe through whichdata flows, they rarely understand the implications.andP;  For example, the narrowbandwidth of CD-ROM doesn't just mean that it takes time to read files, italso means that compression is necessary simply to be able to read fastenough to produce motion video.andM;Keeping in mind the various critical bandwidths can make anyone's head spin.andO;There are CD-ROMs, various speeds of magnetic disk drives, magneto-opticaldrives, floppy drives, system buses (choose from NuBus, new NuBus [NeXT],EISA, ISA [or AT], MCA, etc.), local area networks (choose from twisted pair,Ethernet, various kinds of fiber, broadband, baseband), telecommunicationslines (dial-up, ISDN, T1 and heaven knows what else) and there are probablyquite a few others we haven't thought of.andM;Converting analog signal bandwidths to digital bandwidths is confusing, too.andO;Television takes 5 MHz of radio frequency analog bandwidth, but anuncompressed digital video signal is much, much more than 5 megabits/second.andO;How much more depends on what kind of digital video you're talking about.andM;Here's a weird one that we just learned.andP;  A 9600 bps modem operates at 2400baud.andP;  If you've been using modems for a while, that probably sounds prettystrange because &quot;baud&quot; always used to be equal to &quot;bits per second.&quot;andP;  Butbaud referst to the number of analog signal changes per second, while bitsper second refers to the digital throughput of the telecommunications link.andM;Storage capacityandM;A gigabyte?andP;  A kilobyte?andP;  A megabyte?andP;  How about a megabit?andP;  Eventually,selling storage for audiovisual material with these terms will seem asstrange as selling videotape by the foot (they used to, you know).andO;Videotapes are sold by how many minutes of video can be recorded.andO;Three-speed recorders make that confusing, but image if consumers had tocalculate how many minutes of video per foot.andM;Kodak, perhaps because it's accustomed to consumer markets, didn't play gameslike this with PhotoCD, the technology it's planning to deliver in a coupleof years.andP;  Kodak didn't announce that the CDs will hold 50 to 300 images,depending on resolution.andP;  &quot;Resolution?&quot;andP;  What's that?andP;  No, these discs willhold 100 images.andP;  Easy, right?andP;  Just like you can get 35mm film in 24 or 36exposure lenghts.andP;  Later, perhaps we'll have a 200 image PhotoCD.andP;  But youcan bet that Kodak won't sell it as a 1.2-gigabyte disc.andM;Likewise, when you use a CD-ROM for DVI video, it's a 72-minute disc, not a600 megabyte disc.andP;  You know, 600 megabytes sounds like a lot.andP;  But 72minutes is pretty palltry compared with all those 120-minute VHS video-tapesin the grocery store.andM;Remember, customers mostly still haven't figured out the difference betweenmemory and storage.andM;LatencyandM;Combine storage capacity with bandwidth and you have a concept called latencythat very few people now understand or can quickly grasp.andP;  High latencyessentially means the ability to read a lot of data quickly.andP;  CD-ROMs don'thave high latency because you can read a lot of data, but not fast.andP;  Magneticdrives are very fast, but hardly any of them close to CD-ROM's capacity, sotheir latency is low.andM;A huge block of memory chips used as a storage device would have very highlatency, but the price is prohibitive for the capacities that would interestus, which are in the realm of gigabytes.andP;  The size and power requirementswould be annoying, too.andM;There's a lot of research going into technologies such as holographicstorage, which ahve high latency, which is necessary for serious audiovisualstorage and retrieval.andM;JPEG, MPEG and DVIandM;Save us from this means, someone.andP;  We wanted to cover compression, bandwidth,storage capacity and latency before tackling this mess.andM;Last month, we insisted that Intel's DVI deserves a lot more respect.andP;  Quitea few people let us know that they agree, though they're a bit timid aboutsaying so in public, since DVI-bashing is in such style.andM;The input we've received since last month has helped us clarify the problemwith great precision.andP;  The common argument runs everyone else's MPEG chipsare better than Intel's MPEG chips.andM;The problem with this argument is that NO ONE HAS MPEG CHIPS YET!andP;  No one!andO;Not even JVC, which showed &quot;simulated MPEG&quot; video in its booth at Comdex.andM;We sat next to one of the industry's most vocal advocates of multimediatechnology in the JVC booth.andP;  When the announcer introduced the &quot;simulatedMPEG video,&quot; we observed that the meant it's not live from a chip.andP;  &quot;Shutup,&quot; our friend responded.andP;  &quot;Shut up.&quot;andP;  People want to believe there'ssomething better than DVI.andP;  They should take a look at the latest generationof DVI chips.andM;As for those who point to JPEG video playing from a magneto-optical disc andsay &quot;Wow, this beats DVI!&quot;...andP;  I'll be happy to sell you feature filmscompressed with JPEG.andP;  For a 100-minute film, you'll need about five discs atmore than $100 each.andP;  And a $5,000 drive.andP;  But by golly, you'll get that JPEGimage quality.andM;Sorry.andP;  We didn't mean to launch into such sarcasm.andM;Our point is simply that a lack of understanding of bandwidth, compressionand storage capacity leads people to misunderstood completely theimplications of various standards.andP;  Once again, when they see live video onthe screen, they don't realize what's really going on or the limitations thatgo with it.andM;Who cares?andM;End users for the most part simply aren't going to learn all of thistechnological mumbo-jumbo.andP;  These concepts have to be translated intoeasy-to-understand terms and choices.andM;The important people today are those who will make design and buyingdecisions.andP;  They are the independent and in-house multimedia producers.andO;Their jobs are in training, sales and marketing or other persuasivepresentations, technical documentation, scientific and engineeringvisualizations -- and the big one, consumer information and entertainment.andM;If the designers and producers don't understand the technologies, there'slittle chance that they can create useful products.andP;  They'll be stalled,wondering about non sequiturs such as whether DVI, JPEG and the new Chips andTechnology digitizer chip is best for storing motion video on CD-ROM.andM;Market education is the first step in market development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
