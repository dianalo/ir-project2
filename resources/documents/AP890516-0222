The eight major companies making cars and light trucks in NorthAmerica said Monday they sold a combined average of 36,480 vehiclesa day during the May 1-10 period this year. That compared with anaverage of 39,771 during the same time last year. Car sales weredown 9.8 percent and truck sales were off 5.3 percent.   But year-to-year comparison was colored by one of the strongest10-day periods last year, the second-best selling year in autoindustry history. A large portion of the incentives in effect inearly May last year expired May 11, prompting buyers who had waitedto head to dealerships to take advantage of the enticements.   Incentives also were in effect during the period this year. FordMotor Co.'s program expires May 31, General Motors Corp.'s diesJune 5 and Chrysler Corp.'s runs indefinitely. All offer buyers theoption of cash rebates or low-interest financing.   Despite the statistical drop, dealers said Monday that businesswas good.   ``We had a very good March, April and May last year,'' said JoeMatts, new car sales manager at Jones-West Ford-Mitsubishi in Reno,Nev. ``If you compare it to last year, it's off, but that was avery good year.''   Herb Adcox, owner of Herb Adcox Chevrolet-Geo in Chattanooga,Tenn., agreed, saying incentives helped sales.   ``Most of them are taking the money,'' he said of the rebates.``We're doing little or none on financing.''   The automakers began the incentive programs at the start of thesecond quarter after sales during the first three months came inbelow expectations. Production continued at an ambitious pace,meaning swelling inventories.   Incentives have helped trim inventory levels, but analysts nowsay that production cuts in the third period are likely.   For the year, the companies reported car and truck sales running4.1 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales off 6.1 percentand truck sales down 0.5 percent.   GM's car sales fell 9.5 percent during the May 1-10 period andwere 10.6 percent below the 1988 year-to-date rate. GM's trucksales were up 6.1 percent in early May but down 0.5 percent for theyear.   Ford's car sales were off 11.1 percent in early May and down 0.8percent for the year. The company's light truck sales during earlyMay this year were 11.9 percent behind last year's rate and 3.6percent lower than the year-to-date rate last year.   Chrysler's car sales dropped 14.6 percent during the period andwere running 16.8 percent behind last year's pace. Sales ofChrysler's light truck sales were off 9.3 percent for the periodand up 1.1 percent for the year.</TEXT></DOC>
