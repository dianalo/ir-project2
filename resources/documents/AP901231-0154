Not at all.Simply prudent behavior.   Who says so? Professor McKenzie says so. Richard McKenzie,professor of finance and economics at the University ofMississippi, and somewhat of a rarity in his ability to assemblescholarly data in clarifying popular issues.   True, McKenzie is a believer in the ability of the marketplaceto make intelligent adjustments to changes in supply and demand,but he assumes that you too believe in that system. Or do you?   As a participant in the real estate market - most people areparticipants, as owners or renters - you might find of specialinterest this aspect of his argument:   ``The charge that producers should not profit from the Iraqicrisis is about as sensible as claiming that homeowners in LosAngeles who bought their houses in the 1950s are morally bound notto profit when selling them.''   If homeowners do not collect their accumulated profits, asks theprofessor, how will they be able to replace their homes. Theycannot, he suggests, declare that the marketplace shouldaccommodate them. Of course not.   Besides, if they decline to take profits, that doesn't mean theprofits aren't there. It means only that the owner-seller declinesto accept them; the profits will be passed on to the buyer, whowill collect them on the next resale.   Except for his strong belief in free markets, McKenzie has noknown reason to defend oil companies. His identification with thesubject is academic, as a professor, and as a fellow of the Centerfor the Study of American Business, based on the campus of St.Louis' Washington University.   In that latter regard, he produced ``Working Paper 137,''detailing his findings and conclusions.   -Taking 1967 as a base year, the price of a gallon of gasoline($1.38 at the time the paper was written) had risen less since 1960than the price of the basket of goods that goes into thecalculation of the consumer price index.   -Uncle Sam has a bit to do with those higher pump prices.Gasoline taxes were 10.5 cents a gallon in 1960. They rose to 14.5cents in 1981 and to 26.9 cents in July 1990. And, of course, theyhave just risen again.   -The quality of gasoline has risen, providing more miles to thegallon and less pollution too. American consumers are now spendinga much smaller percent of disposable income on gasoline than in1970 or earlier decades.   In 1989, McKenzie states, ``gasoline expenditures for the`typical' consumer as a percent of his or her disposable incomefell precipitously to less than one-half of the 1970 level and toalmost a third of the 1980 level.''   McKenzie makes this effort - stressed in his paper - to describerecent pricing events at the pump, which a great many Americanshave chosen to call gouging:   ``Oil markets must not only account for current reductions insupplies but also must seek to anticipate the prospects of furtherdeclines in the oil supplies.''   When production of any good or service involves delivery at afuture time, he explains, ``then competitive prices reflect bothcurrent and expected future supplies.''   It is like the Los Angeles homeowner who must worry aboutearning enough on the sale of his present house to buy another,especially if the housing market, like the oil market, is volatileand unpredictable.   For oil companies and service stations to deny the futureuncertainty of their markets would have been folly, says McKenzie,who repeats:   ``The major cost of staying in business is not the past purchaseprice of any item in inventory but the future replacement cost ofthat item.''   If there has been collusion with the industry or a conspiracy togouge the public, McKenzie says that those involved have done amighty poor job of it.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wed, Jan 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
