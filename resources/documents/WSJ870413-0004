SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Big banks discovered in the first quarter that life after lending isn't any cakewalk.    Most of them have tried to shore up lower profits from lending in recent years with income from currency and bond trading, investment-banking fees and various special gains. But as the trickle of first-quarter results indicates, the strategy appears far from foolproof.    Last week, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. reported a 3.2% decline in first-quarter earnings as lower trading profit failed to offset reduced income from troubled loans in Brazil. Analysts believe most large banks had flat or slightly lower first-quarter results, and they don't expect the full year to be much better.    &quot;The trend is adverse for big banks,&quot; asserts David Cates, a New York financial consultant. The major banks deny their position has declined significantly, but many are pressing to find new ways to maintain or improve the bottom line.    Last year, almost 25% of the industry's net income was from gains from selling securities and other special items, according to federal data, and seemingly unusual gains were just as crucial for some of the giants in the latest quarter.    BankAmerica Corp., for example, is depending upon a $120 million pre-tax gain from the recent sale of its Charles Schwab andamp; Co. discount-brokerage unit to help offset first-quarter operating losses.    &quot;What would appear to be nonrecurring earnings are a growing part of the business of banks,&quot; says William Gibson, an executive vice president, of Continental Illinois Corp. of Chicago.    But in the latest quarter, such gains weren't always enough. The main reason was Brazil's February suspension of foreign debt interest payments, which led the big banks to put Brazilian debt on non-accrual status, cutting earnings. But the crisis masked several other problems.    A few important new sources of profit suffered a reversal in the latest quarter, even as banks continued to incur sharply higher costs associated with building the new business. Bond trading, a main source of industry profit growth in 1986's first quarter, was pinched, reflecting stable interest rates compared with a year ago. It triggered a small loss at Morgan, which had a large year-earlier profit.    Big bank loan losses also didn't abate much. First Chicago Corp., which reported a 3.2% increase in net income, said charge-offs fell just 5%. Things worsened at Mellon Bank Corp., which reported a $60 million net loss because of sharply higher energy and real-estate losses.    &quot;Loan quality is still quite rotten for the industry,&quot; says Stephen Berman, analyst for County Securities USA in New York.    Moreover, loan losses &quot;are going to be high relative to historical norms,&quot; says Christopher Mahoney, analyst for Moody's Investors Service Inc. Large banks, he says, are being forced to take on riskier loans, such as for leveraged buyouts, in order to counteract an exodus of large corporate customers.    Profit growth is apt to be more impressive among the largest regional banks, which have generally cheaper funding costs than the major New York banks and continue to benefit from heavy lending to small and medium-sized companies, where demand has held up. They also have a smaller stake in Brazil. Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp. expects to report roughly 9% higher earnings than the year-earlier $88 million, or $1.11 a share.    Most analysts expect the giants to have larger jumps in profit as the year proceeds, but the increase for all of 1987 will be modest at best. Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a New York-based bank securities firm, projects that a dozen of the largest banks will have median profit growth of 7%. The boosts would be largely obliterated if the stand-off with Brazil continues, but bankers are confident the crisis will be resolved in the next few months.    Meanwhile, the stock market is viewing the biggest banks warily. Bank stocks are up about 5% this year, compared with about a 25% increase for the market as a whole. Market interest in bank stocks, says James McDermott, Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods's research director, &quot;is just lifeless.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
