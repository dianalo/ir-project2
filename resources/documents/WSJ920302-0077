The plan would give Quebec some of the powers it seeks,but whether it can win the necessary broad support in therest of Canada was uncertain. Most of the constitutionalchanges proposed in the plan require the approval of thefederal government and at least seven of Canada's provinces;some require the consent of all 10 provinces.</LP><TEXT>   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa plans to comment in detailon the federal blueprint tomorrow, a spokeswoman said.   At first glance the federal plan falls short of thedemands by the ruling Quebec Liberal Party. Opposition leaderJacques Parizeau told reporters in Quebec City that thefederal plan is &quot;an insult&quot; and urged Mr. Bourassa to rejectit. Mr. Parizeau's Parti Quebecois supports Quebecindependence.   The all-party report, requested by Prime Minister BrianMulroney, is only the first of a number of hurdles that Mr.Mulroney's Conservative government must cross in its latestquest for a constitutional settlement that will keep Quebecin Canada.   The accord was patched together after hard bargainingamong the three parties, the Conservatives, Liberals and NewDemocrats. The agreement was signed less than an hour beforea midnight Friday deadline for submitting the report toParliament. However, the report wasn't released until Sundayafternoon as the three parties scrambled to sort out a jumbleof last-minute changes to the final text.   The parties recommended that Quebec be recognized in theconstitution as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. They alsorecommended giving Quebec and all other provinces powers insuch areas as manpower training, inland fisheries, andpersonal bankruptcy. Quebec would also be assured of threeseats on the nine-seat Supreme Court and would have a vetoover certain constitutional changes.   Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark said, &quot;Quebecersshould take really great confidence from this.&quot;   Regardless of how Quebecers react, other Canadians aren'texpected to be enthusiastic about the plan. A previousattempt to reach a constitutional settlement in 1990 failedmainly because Canadians outside of Quebec objected to givingQuebec special constitutional status. Opposition to specialpowers for Quebec doesn't show any signs of waning. A GallupCanada poll last week said 92% of Canadians outside of Quebecoppose giving the French-speaking province more powers thanother provinces to keep it in Canada.   Alberta's Deputy Premier Jim Horsman promptly rejected theproposed constitutional veto for Quebec because he said thatwould make other provinces &quot;second class&quot; in constitutionalmatters.   Conservative Gerald Beaudoin, co-chairman of the all-partycommittee, said that under the plan &quot;Quebec is getting more&quot;than in the failed 1990 package of constitutional changes,known as the Meech Lake accord. But Lucien Bouchard, leaderof the Bloc Quebecois, which supports Quebec independence,said the all-party plan &quot;is a step backwards&quot; for Quebec.   Former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who opposes specialstatus for Quebec, is expected to reassert his views laterthis month, a prospect that has all three parties edgybecause of his considerable influence with the public.   Mr. Mulroney will discuss the all-party plan with theprovinces and national native Canadian leaders over the nextfew weeks. The plan would give native Canadians theconstitutional right to self-government.   The federal government intends to present a finalconstitutional reform proposal in mid-April. If that packagewins broad acceptance, the federal and provinciallegislatures would be asked to approve it in a constitutionalamendment bill.   The process is under deadline pressure because of a Quebeclaw requiring a Quebec referendum on independence by Octoberif the rest of Canada doesn't come up with an acceptableconstitutional plan. Quebec wants a binding offer, whichmeans that the federal government and the other provincesmust ratify any constitutional reform plan before Quebecconsiders it.   Quebec's threat to hold an independence vote &quot;isn't abluff,&quot; the province's justice minister warned last week.&quot;The time is short,&quot; the three parties said in their report.   The current uncertainties are also costly. Financialanalysts say Canadian interest rates would be lower but forthe political uncertainties. Short-term Canadian interestrates are currently about three percentage points abovecomparable U.S. rates. &quot;A wave of politically inspiredcapital flight can't be ruled out later this year&quot; if theconstitutional effort fails, warned International Bank CreditAnalyst, a Montreal financial forecasting service.   The federal government initiated the constitutionaldeliberations last September, with a document setting out 28proposals. The three political parties recommended that someof the federal proposals be shelved, including a plan tonarrow the Bank of Canada's mandate to focus only onachieving price stability.</TEXT></DOC>
