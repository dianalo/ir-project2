Army teams laid metal sheeting over the grass in the two parks toprovide 7,000 extra parking spaces to ease congestion as commuterswho normally take public transportation took to their vehicles.   Another 1,000 park-and-ride spaces were made available onLondon's outskirts, but police said: ``Only drive into London if youmust.''   Investment manager Jeremy Soutter and three colleagues traveledto work along the River Thames straddling a 13-foot-long inflatabletube towed by a speedboat. Their suits got a bit wet, but Souttersaid they enjoyed the meandering, seven-mile ride.   The Confederation of British Industry estimated nearly 75 percentof London workers showed up today.   Many commuters booked hotels and taxis. Some companies hiredbuses.   Harrods department store postponed its summer sale for fear thestrikes would prevent shoppers getting into central London.   State-owned British Rail announced record profits of $486 milliontoday, but said most of the surplus was reinvested and not used forpay rises.   London has been beset by 24-hour strikes on its subway system forthree months. But today was only the second time that workers on thethree major transport networks struck at once.   The rail strike was the third one-day nationwide stoppage inthree weeks.   Union militancy in Britain is on the upsurge following a decadeof reverses as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservativegovernment curbed union powers.   On Tuesday, public services from slaughterhouses to librariesoperated by city halls were disrupted throughout Britain by aone-day walkout over pay. The National Association of LocalGovernment Officers said 90 percent of its 500,000 members on citypayrolls stayed home.   The 17-union Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions, meanwhile, has threatened strikes against selected companiesto demand a shorter working week and morepay for 2 million workers.   Unions say 4,000 North Sea oil workers are involved in a disputeover pay and safety measures, and dock workers have threatened anational strike over government plans to abolish their long-standingjobs-for-life guarantee.   Strikes this year have regularly shut passport offices anddisrupted news and current affairs programs at the BritishBroadcasting Corp.   Referring to Wednesday's strikes, Mrs. Thatcher told the House ofCommons on Tuesday: ``I think the unions have given no thought tothe general public.''   But Neil Kinnock, opposition Labor Party leader, accusedConservatives of seeking to exploit public anger over the strikesfor their own political ends.   Today's strike by 10,500 London subway employees was their ninthin 13 weeks to demand extra pay for operating trains without aguard. They want a $101 weekly increase while management has offered$47 plus 14 days extra annual vacation, with the raise tied toincreased productivity.   The 75,000-member National Union of Railway Workers wants a 10percent pay increase. Management is offering 7 percent, which isless than inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
