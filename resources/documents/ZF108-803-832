 Based on the RDBdatabase for Vax computers, the package provides a way to create acontent-based database from which a department can track, edit, route andmanage the flow of publication components throughout the editorial andproduction cycle.andP;  The product supports Digital's Compound DocumentArchitecture (CDA), which in turn enables it to support popular Digital-basedcomposition systems.andP;  Its first customer is Philips, which is using it inconjunction with Interleaf TPS to produce product documentation.andM;Content, structure, attributes.andP;  DeltaP is a layer of software between thepublishing applications and the underlying operating system.andP;  Documentcomponents are stored in a content database, in which components are indexedby reference and a summary of their attributes created.andP;  The database alsocontains the document structure, based on an SGML document type definition(DTD), and style attributes about content elements.andM;The user may set up the database in three ways: start from scratch; importtext and manually add structure; or load both text and structure through anSGML import filter.andP;  Content is stored independent of the database, so thatgraphics, for example, do not have to be translated.andP;  Text is stored in ASCIIform with generic markup.andM;The SGML DTD, an editable text file, is interpreted by DeltaP, which offersits own interface for modifying document structure.andP;  When DTDs are editedwithin DeltaP, they may still be exported through the SGML translationsoftware.andP;  Because it supports SGML-tagged databases in a generic sense,DeltaP may be configured for CALS applications.andM;Within the database, the use of attributes allows for conditional output.andO;Attributes typically include the element type (header, footer, product name,etc.), its purpose (action, notes to author, etc.), status and othermanagement information.andM;At the heart of DeltaP is a master document, which defines the three aspectsof any one document: its structure, its components (content) and theirattributes (style).andP;  As we mentioned, content and structure may be directlyinput into DeltaP, as the product was specifically developed to allow thisfunction.andP;  Formatting styles are applied outside of DeltaP when a document isexported for composition and pagination.andM;DeltP retrieves document elements and creates the publication by mapping itsstructure to composition tag names and a style template.andP;  At this time,DECwrite and Interleaf TPS templates are directly supported.andP;  However, DeltaPsupports Digital's Document Interchange Format (DDIF), from which documentsmay be translated to most Digital-based composition systems that supportgeneric tagging, including DECwrite, Interleaf TPS, Datalogics' Pager,Xyvision Parlance and Frame's FrameMaker.andM;DeltaP allows for multiple language versions of the document and has fulledit trace, which may be turned on to prevent output of new material that hasnot been updated.andP;  DeltaP relies on Digital's Engineering Document ControlSystem to offer additional tracking and management throughout all stages ofthe publishing process.andM;The typical DeltaP system configuration is a Vax VMS file server with the RDBSQL database sitting on a network with Macs, PCs, Vaxstations or dumbterminals and PostScript output devices for proofing and final output.andP;  Textmay created at various workstations using third-party products and importedinto DeltaP in ASCII form, with DeltaP converting markup into tags andattributes.andP;  DeltaP software may be used to create and edit text andstructure as well.andM;Graphics are not displayed within DeltaP, but a marker identifies theirposition.andP;  The graphics are called from their source by the software whenthey are required.andM;The user creates and edits document structure in much the same way as onewould use an outline processor, working with a list of elements that can beextended or reduced.andP;  The database software supports nesting of documentelements and attributes, down to specifying the font, style and size of aspecific character within a specific or otherwise defined context.andM;DEC and Interleaf in Belgium are both involved with the project and haveworked closely with Trisoft to ensure that DeltaP will work with CDA andInterleaf's active documents feature.andP;  According to both companies, they viewDeltaP as a product for linking disparate systems and platforms into acohesive whole.andM;Saving fuel at Philips.andP;  Trisoft's first customer for DeltaP is Philips,which is beta testing the software in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.andP;  Amanufacturer of consumer durables and of industrial and professionalproducts, Philips estimates that its annual print production for &quot;directionsfor use&quot; booklets alone requires enough wood to heat the average home for 865years.andP;  Needless to say, Philips is looking carefully at alternativeapproaches for information delivery.andM;Philips hopes the DeltaP project will ultimately form part of a system wherebooklets are printed on demand (presumably at the point of sale), accordingto the specifics of the equipment purchased, with the information tailored tothe exact configuration purchased.andP;  Tailoring would be in areas such asoptions described (based on what was purchased), language, power requirementsand so forth.andM;Perhaps even more troublesome than its publishing tasks, though, arePhilips's data management requirements.andP;  The life cycle for a &quot;Directions forUse&quot; booklet, from inception of a product to delivery of manufactured goods,is currently 22 weeks, during which there is on-going dialogue amongdesigners, marketing and legal staff and consumer representatives.andM;With DeltaP installed, Philips reckons to reduce that time to 15 weeks, withimproved data management and a more streamlined process.andP;  Authors work with amaster document, and the software creates derived versions from a featurelist, linked to all users' sign-on profiles.andP;  The solution is modularized,with a document database module and an interactive WYSIWYG module.andM;Trisoft's DeltaP is the latest entrant in the emerging class of documentmanagement software.andP;  What sets it apart is its ability to recognize andmanipulate the underlying structure of documents that are stored ascomponents in a database.andP;  We hope to visit Philips later in the year toprovide a follow-up report.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
