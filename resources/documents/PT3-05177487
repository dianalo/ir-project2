Preferably, a median sea velocity is stored for each coverage area, as the      median value. When processing begins for a coverage area, a previously      stored median sea velocity is retrieved and updated. The median sea      velocity is updated by converting the median sea velocity into a median      phase difference between two echo signals, based upon carrier frequency      and the time between receipt of two echo signals, which is preferably more      than one interpulse period. The difference in phase between the two echo      signals is compared with the median phase difference and the median sea      velocity is increased if the median phase difference is smaller and      decreased if the median phase difference is larger. A rejection filter is      selected based upon the previously stored median sea velocity (preferably      after adjustment based on the carrier frequency) to remove the echoes from      the sea from the radar echo signals. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a sea velocity evaluator for accurately      determining the velocity of radar echoes from waves in the sea in real      time and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for removing sea      clutter from radar signals by continuously determining the sea velocity      for a predetermined segment of a radar scan, and automatically selecting a      filter centered at that velocity. </PAR><PAR>  2.Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Clutter is produced by unwanted radar echoes which clutter radar output and      make the detection of targets difficult. It is well known that sea clutter      should be filtered out of radar signals prior to analyzing the radar      signals for the detection of targets. Both amplitude and Doppler spectrum      of echoes received from the surface of the sea are dependent upon      geographically and temporally variable parameters such as wave height,      wind speed, direction of the waves relative to the radar beam, the      presence of swells or waves, and the like. Nevertheless, since the sea is      relatively uniform over areas of modest size, its average velocity      (Doppler frequency) can be estimated. It is also known that once the      average sea velocity is estimated, the sea clutter can be removed from the      radar signals using a filter. Namely, a rejection filter can be centered      on the average sea velocity to filter out the sea clutter from the radar      signals. </PAR><PAR>  Two techniques have been employed in the past to filter out sea clutter.      Sea clutter could not be fully suppressed and target detection was      hindered using these known techniques. </PAR><PAR>  With the first technique, the radar system typically includes a rejection      filter with a fixed rejection notch centered on a Doppler frequency of      zero. Doppler frequency refers to a Doppler shift which corresponds to an      amount of change in the observed frequency of an echo signal due to the      relative motion of the radar system and the target. This rejection filter,      together with a voltage-controlled local oscillator in a superheterodyne      receiver which acts to keep the sea clutter within the rejection notch of      the filter, attempts to suppress sea clutter by altering the echo      frequency as the radar system scans in azimuth. This first technique      treats echoes from all ranges of a radar scan commonly, thus reducing      accuracy, because sea state is not constant over large geographic areas. </PAR><PAR>  With the second technique, the radar system had to be physically disrupted      periodically to make adjustments. The system used either a manual or an      automatic selection of rejection filters from a few available choices      using map zones having range and azimuth. The selection of the rejection      filter was determined by whichever filter achieved the minimum total echo      energy from all the echoes including targets as well as sea clutter. In      effect, the rejection filter was selected on a trial and error basis in      which the rejection filter which resulted in the minimum energy output or      the fewest alarms was selected. </PAR><PAR>  During the readjustment of the rejection filter in the second method, the      radar output is cluttered and must be ignored. In other words, the radar      system is out of commission during readjustment. As a result, the time      period between readjustments had to be carefully selected to balance      between too frequent disruptions in radar output and too slow response to      changed sea conditions. Also, this second technique could not compensate      for gradual change of the sea state occurring between readjustments of the      rejection filter. The prior art techniques were not only inaccurate, but      also produced erroneous measurements due to the presence of ships, rain,      cellular storms, and the like. Further, both methods associated with the      prior art could not accurately compensate for agile changes in carrier      frequency because a change in carrier frequency causes a change in Doppler      frequency. To partially compensate for this inability, the prior art      techniques used filters with wide rejection bands. However, using filters      with wide rejection bands reduces target detection by the radar systems      associated with the prior art. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention to provide a sea velocity evaluator      which determines a median sea echo velocity for a predetermined segment of      a radar scan with minimal vulnerability to moving targets, pulse      interference, rain and the like. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention to provide a method for removing      sea clutter from radar signals by continuously determining a median sea      velocity value and automatically selecting a filter in accordance with the      median sea velocity value determined. </PAR><PAR>  A further object of the present invention to provide a method for removing      sea clutter from radar signals without disrupting normal operation of the      radar system and for automatically compensating for sudden changes in      carrier frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Yet another object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for      removing sea clutter from radar signals by periodically selecting a sea      clutter rejection filter based on a continuously determined median sea      velocity value. </PAR><PAR>  The above objects are attained by providing a method for determining sea      velocity from radar echo signals, said method comprising the steps of:      dividing a radar scan into a plurality of coverage areas; and computing      the sea velocity for each coverage area based on the radar echo signals      received therefrom. Preferably, a median sea velocity is stored for each      coverage area. When processing begins for a coverage area, the previously      stored median sea velocity is retrieved and updated. The median sea      velocity is updated by converting the median sea velocity into a median      phase difference between two echo signals, based upon carrier frequency      and the time between receipt of two echo signals, which is preferably more      than one interpulse period. The difference in phase between the two echo      signals is compared with the median phase difference and the median sea      velocity is increased if the median phase difference is smaller and      decreased if the median phase difference is larger. A rejection filter is      selected based upon the previously stored median sea velocity (preferably      after adjustment based on the carrier frequency) to remove the echoes from      the sea from the radar echo signals. </PAR><PAR>  These objects together with other objects and advantages which will be      subsequently apparent, reside in the details of the construction and      operation as ore fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being      had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like      numerals refer to like parts throughout. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating basic principles of the present      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B) are flowcharts illustrating an embodiment of the      present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a chart illustrating a preferred range and azimuth size of a      predetermined segment; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for performing the      method of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating basic principles of the present      invention. A radar system transmits electromagnetic radiation and receives      (10) echo signals which are reradiated by reflecting objects. The      reflecting objects include, for example, targets and the sea. The present      invention uses the normal channel of a radar system which does not subject      the received echo signals to any Doppler filtering. The preferred      embodiment is used in a digital radar system in which the echo signals,      otherwise known as return radar signals, are received, sampled and      converted to digital values in the form of echo vectors having cartesian      coordinates at a multiplicity of closely-spaced sampling points covering      the instrumental range of the radar. The phases of the echo signals are      obtained from the echo vectors. </PAR><PAR>  Next, a phase difference between a current radar signal and a previous      return radar signal is computed (12). A previous return radar signal is      produced by storing a return radar signal for one or more interpulse      periods. In effect, the storing acts to delay the return radar signal by      one or more interpulse periods. An interpulse period is the period of time      between the transmission of successive radiation pulses by the      transmitting unit of the radar system. Using a phase difference obtained      over multiple interpulse periods enables discrimination between      narrow-spectrum sea clutter and broad-spectrum rain clutter, thereby      permitting the narrow spectrum sea clutter to be measured with reduced      corruption by broad-spectrum rain clutter. The present invention filters      out the narrow-spectrum sea clutter, but the parameters of a radar often      make it impossible to filter out broad-spectrum rain clutter because the      width of the spectrum is dependent on wind conditions and is often a large      function of the pulse repetition frequency. Therefore, other techniques      are used to suppress broad-spectrum rain clutter. </PAR><PAR>  Although a delay of one interpulse period can be used, preferably, the      present invention utilizes a delay of two or more interpulse periods. A      delay of multiple interpulse periods results in decreasing the maximum      velocity within the system ambiguity. Ambiguity refers to the maximum      velocity or Doppler shift the system can measure without gross error.      Delay results in ambiguity due to the fact that if the echo moves a      half-wavelength in range during the delay, it produces a phase difference      of zero. That is, the radar system would incorrectly detect a velocity of      zero. </PAR><PAR>  For example, when the delay is two interpulse periods, each averaging 4630      .mu.sec, the system ambiguity is around 12 knots. This is appropriate for      measuring sea echo velocity which should not exceed .andplus;-.6 knots. On the      other hand, wind-blown rain typically has a spectrum broader than 12      knots, and the ambiguity makes the measured phase difference nearly      random. This reduces error created by strong cellular rain occupying a      portion of the geographic coverage area where sea velocity is being      measured. </PAR><PAR>  After the phase difference is computed (12), it is compared (14) with a      previously determined (i.e., predicted) median phase difference of the      radar pulse. The median phase difference is proportional (see equation 1)      to the product of three variables: the average velocity of the sea, the      carrier frequency of the radar pulse, and the time delay. A median value      which is proportional to the median phase difference is updated (16) in      accordance with the results of the comparing in step 14. That is, the      median value is adjusted to make the median value more accurately reflect      the actual average velocity of the sea clutter. The median value is      preferably stored as a median range rate, so that rapid change in      interpulse period and/or carrier frequency can be compensated more easily.      However, it could be represented as the median phase difference or Doppler      shift. Therefore, the comparing in step 14 need not compare phase      differences; it can alternatively compare range rates or Doppler shifts in      a like manner. </PAR><PAR>  The median value can be updated (16) by incrementing by 1 if the measured      phase difference is greater than the predicted median phase difference and      decrementing by one if it is less. Alternatively, a mean range rate could      be stored and updated (16) by a fraction of the difference between the      measured phase difference and the predicted phase difference, but it would      be more easily distorted by extraneous pulse interference, ships and other      echo sources within the range-azimuth zone. </PAR><PAR>  Next, a filter is selected (18) in accordance with a previously stored      median value for the next coverage area, so that the sea clutter is      filtered out of the radar signals. Preferably, the previously stored      median value is adjusted using the transmit frequency of the next scan to      account for Doppler frequency shifts in the return radar signals. The      adjusted median Doppler frequency is used to make the filter selection.      Namely, by selecting a filter dependent upon the median value of the sea      clutter, which is continuously updated, the sea clutter can be effectively      suppressed. As a result, the present invention provides a method for      continuously and accurately determining the velocity of the sea, while not      being overly sensitive to moving targets, pulse interference, rain, and      the like. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B) are flowcharts illustrating an embodiment of the      present invention. The method illustrated in FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B) operates      to continuously determine the median sea velocity for a geographic zone      viewed by a radar system. Thereafter, the method can be used to select a      filter in accordance with the median sea velocity to suppress the sea      clutter. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIG. 2A, processing for a predetermined segment begins      when a preceding echo signal in a radar scan is received (100). The      predetermined segment of a radar scan can be an azimuth region of the      radar scan. However, preferably, the predetermined segment is a coverage      area which corresponds to a small geographic zone of the radar system. The      coverage area is formed by dividing the radar scan by both range and      azimuth. Each coverage area, for example, could be projected onto a sector      of an annulus in the horizontal plane which is eight nautical miles by      5.625.degree. as illustrated in FIG. 3. Thus, each coverage area is      referred to below as a range azimuth gate (RAG) because the zones are      divided by range and azimuth. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIG. 3, if the present invention is used in a stationary      radar system, a land/sea map may be included. The land/sea map is      constructed for a predetermined geographic region to indicate which      portions of the geographic region correspond to land and which portions of      the region correspond to sea. Then, all received samples of a      predetermined segment which correspond to a region over land can be      discarded by the sea velocity evaluator, thus leaving only samples      corresponding to the sea. An example of a map is a fine grain map with      resolution on the order of one-eighth of a nautical mile by 1.4.degree.. </PAR><PAR>  Eventually, the present invention receives all the echo signals for each of      the predetermined segments. The number of echo signals within each RAG is      typically in the neighborhood of 10,000 echo signals. As the echo signals      for a predetermined segment are received, the echo signals are processed      as follows. </PAR><PAR>  The phase of a preceding echo signal in a predetermined segment is measured      and stored (102) for one or more interpulse periods. The purpose of this      step is to facilitate the determining of the phase difference over one or      more interpulse periods as previously described with respect to FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  When a subsequent echo signal within the predetermined segment is received      (104), a phase difference between the preceding and subsequent echo      signals can be calculated (106). Typically, the phase of the preceding      echo signal which has been delayed by one or more interpulse periods (by      two in the preferred embodiment) due to its storage is subtracted from the      phase of the subsequent echo signal. The resulting phase difference is      proportional to the velocity of the echo associated with a pair of signals      in a RAG. </PAR><PAR>  As the return radar (echo) signals are received in steps 100 and 104, any      signals received from a range-azimuth cell above land can be discarded, as      discussed above with respect to FIG. 3. In addition, some radar systems      frequently, or at least occasionally, change carrier frequency, as opposed      to repeatedly sending out bursts of multiple pulses in close succession at      different frequencies, with the same set of frequencies used in each      burst. When a change in carrier frequency causes the subsequent echo      signal to have a carrier frequency which is different than the carrier      frequency of the preceding echo signal, the phase difference will be      distorted. The distorted phase difference can be processed like all other      phase differences, provided there are a sufficient number of samples in      each RAG, the carrier frequency does not change very often and the      additional noise in the system is acceptable. If these conditions are not      met, distorted phase differences can be discarded in a manner similar to      echo signals received from a range-azimuth cell above land, whenever the      carrier frequency of the preceding and subsequent echo signals is not the      same. </PAR><PAR>  After the phase difference has been calculated, a previously determined and      stored median range rate for the predetermined segment is converted (108)      to a median phase difference. That is, to easily compensate for changing      interpulse periods and carrier frequencies, the median range rate which      has been previously stored for the current RAG is converted into a median      phase difference. The equation for such conversion is      ##EQU1##      F.sub.0 andequals;transmitting frequency, candequals;speed of light, Vandequals;range rate      (velocity), and T(nandplus;2)-T(n)andequals;time between samples (i.e., two interpulse      periods). </PAR><PAR>  Note, however, processing could also be performed using range rates or      Doppler shifts which like the median phase difference expresses the      velocity of the sea. The method illustrated in FIGS. 2(A) and 2(B)      utilizes a combination of range rate and phase difference to represent the      velocity of the sea, because the proportionality factor is a function of      dynamic variation in interpulse period and carrier frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the phase difference, computed at 106, is subtracted (110) from the      median phase difference produced in step 108. The result of the      subtraction operation indicates whether the median phase difference is      less than, equal to, or greater than the phase difference for the pair of      signals within the current RAG being processed. If the result indicates      that the median phase difference is greater than the phase difference of      the pair of signals, then a count value is decreased (116, 118). On the      other hand, if the result indicates that the median phase difference is      less than the phase difference of the pair of signals, the count value is      increased (112, 114). As indicated in FIGS. 2A and 2B, when the measured      and median phase differences are equal, the count value is not changed. </PAR><PAR>  Next, it is determined (122) whether or not the end of the predetermined      segment (RAG) has been reached. The end of the predetermined segment      indicates all the echo signals within the RAG have been processed. If the      end has not been reached, the processing of the method returns to step 100      to receive subsequent echo signals within the same RAG of the radar scan.      On the other hand, if it is determined (122) that the end of the      predetermined segment has been reached, then all of the signals associated      with the current RAG have been processed. </PAR><PAR>  The updated median range rate is then stored (124) in a zone map. The zone      map stores a median range rate (or a value corresponding thereto) for each      RAG. Thereafter, the next time the predetermined segment is processed, a      filter for suppressing the sea clutter can be selected (126) using the      updated median range rate stored at the end of the previous scan over that      RAG and the carrier frequency in use at the time that the filter is      selected. During the first scan of an area, the range rates in the zone      map are preferably set to zero, so that the stored median range rate in      any cell can quickly converge to maximum velocity in either direction,      e.g., .andplus;-.6 knots. In addition, the count value is initially preset to      correspond to the median range rate previously determined for the RAG. </PAR><PAR>  The median range rate corresponds to the sea velocity for the RAG, and it      is stored with several more bits than used for the phase difference or the      median phase difference. Preferably, a predetermined number of count value      changes, on the order of 128 count value changes, is required to cause a      change in filter selection. Thus, the filter choice would be updated (126)      only after 128 count value changes have accumulated in either a positive      or negative direction. This provides a desired sluggishness in the      updating (126) of the filter choice associated with the sea velocity of      the predetermined segment which prevents drift due to echo signals      resulting from, for example, aircraft and birds, as opposed to the sea. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, after the median range rate is adjusted by the carrier frequency      to account for Doppler frequency, only the most significant bits are used      to select a filter. Thus the filter choice is affected only when a      predetermined number of count value changes in one direction have      occurred. In the previous example, if the delay between echo signals      received in steps 100 and 104 is two interpulse periods, then filters can      be selected (126), ranging from -6.25 knots to andplus;6.25 knots. For example,      26 filters providing increments of 0.5 knots can be used to cover sea      velocities in this range. </PAR><PAR>  Note, the updated median range rate is preferably not utilized until the      next time the same RAG is processed because re-selecting a rejection      filter during processing of a RAG would introduce transients into the      system. Even with a one scan delay, the selected filter effectively      suppresses sea clutter from echo signals within each RAG. Thus, the      present invention results in improved target detection. The updating (120)      of the median range rate for a predetermined segment is performed at the      same time as the processing to detect targets. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for performing the      method of the present invention in a digital radar system. Phase detector      400 receives the cartesian coordinates associated with an echo vector in      one range-azimuth cell within a RAG. The phase detector 400 detects the      phase of each of the incoming input signals to the radar system. </PAR><PAR>  The phase detector 400 can be constructed in a number of ways. The      preferred construction of the phase detector 400 is described in U.S.      patent application Ser. No. 07/266,195, entitled Digital Phase Detector,      and filed on Nov. 2, 1988, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,001,489 and is      hereby incorporated by reference. Further, conventional phase detectors      are easily constructed by those with ordinary skill in the art using, for      example, the well known mathematical approach of taking the tangent of the      angle between the two cartesian coordinates of the echo signal. However,      such processing is cumbersome to a digital computer utilizing software to      detect the phase, thus making specialized digital hardware desirable, in      particular the phase detector described in patent application Ser. No.      07/266,195. </PAR><PAR>  A delay unit 402 respectively stores the phase signals produced by the      phase detector 400 to delay the phase signals by one or more interpulse      periods and preferably two or more interpulse periods. A delay of two      interpulse periods is illustrated in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  A phase difference detecting unit 404 receives the undelayed phase signal      from the phase detector 400 and the delayed phase signal from the delay      unit 402. The phase difference detecting unit 404 then computes the phase      difference by subtracting the delayed phase signal from the undelayed      phase signal. </PAR><PAR>  The phase difference is subtracted by a modulo subtractor 406 from the      median phase difference supplied by a conversion unit 408. The result of      the subtraction is provided as an increment or decrement signal to an      up/down counter 410. The up/down counter 410 may be a twelve bit digital      counter to calculate a twelve bit representation sea velocity, with the      least significant seven bits of the counter 410 providing sluggishness.      The twelve bit value from the up/down counter 410 is converted into      Doppler frequency and the most significant five bits are used in selecting      a Doppler filter. A storage control unit 410 receives the median range      rate and controls the operation of the conversion unit 408, a storage unit      414 and a filter selection unit 416. In addition, the control unit 412      stores the initial median range rate in the up/down counter 410 at the      beginning of each RAG period. </PAR><PAR>  The storage unit 414 stores a median value, which corresponds to sea      velocity, for each RAG. That is, the storage unit 414 stores a zone map      which includes either Doppler frequency, phase difference, or preferably      range rate for each RAG. The apparatus illustrated in FIG. 4 specifically      illustrates the storage of median range rate. However, phase difference or      Doppler shift could alternatively have been used by providing additional      conversion units since these values are easily converted from one to      another. </PAR><PAR>  The conversion unit 408 converts the median range rate (or other      representation of sea velocity) stored in the storage unit 414 into a      median phase difference for the currently used carrier frequency and      interpulse period. The conversion unit 408 may employ multipliers or a      programmable read-only memory (PROM) containing a look-up table for making      the conversions. The preferred embodiment is designed for use with      frequency agile radars in which the carrier frequency can change after a      burst of pulses and interpulse period can change with any pulse. Thus, the      conversion unit 408 calculates an appropriate median phase difference in      accordance with equation (1) for every pair of echo signals based upon the      frequency used and the time delay between the pair of echo signals. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably as the processing of the signals within the predetermined      segment continues, the count value stored in the up/down counter 410 is      sent to the conversion unit 408 under the control of the control unit 412      to calculate an up-to-date median phase difference. Thus, the modulo      subtractor 406 always uses the most accurate median phase difference      available. Although it is not as accurate, the initial median phase      difference associated with the initial count value could be used      throughout the processing of all the signals within a RAG. </PAR><PAR>  When all the echo signals of the predetermined segment have been processed,      the control unit 412 stores the count value contained in the up/down      counter 410 in the storage unit 414 to update the median range rate for      the RAG which just ended. Thereafter, the filter selection unit 416      selects a sea clutter rejection filter for the next RAG to be processed      using the median range rate previously stored in the storage unit 414 for      that RAG. The median range rate is modified by the carrier frequency in      the filter selection unit 416 to convert to median Doppler frequency. This      is most important at higher sea velocities where the adjustment for      Doppler shifting causes the selection of a different filter from that      which would be selected if the median range rate alone was used. The      control unit 412 controls the filter selection process at the end of each      RAG. </PAR><PAR>  As a result, a rejection filter centered on the median range rate of the      sea velocity for a given predetermined segment can be selected in order to      suppress sea clutter. As noted above, the present invention is also very      flexible in that it can readily compensate for changes in both the      interpulse period and the carrier frequency. The system compensates for a      change in carrier frequency by the conversion of range rate into Doppler      frequency in the filter selection unit 416 and compensates for both      frequency and interpulse period variation by the conversion into phase      difference in conversion unit 408. Neither of the prior art techniques      were able to immediately compensate for changes in carrier frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Since radar systems generally transmit a fixed pattern variation of a      pulse, radar systems have advance information regarding the time      difference between pulses (i.e., interpulse period). Further, the carrier      frequency or frequencies currently in use is available. The present      invention can be used with a radar system simultaneously using two      different transfer or carrier frequencies. The preferred embodiment of the      present invention can be used in a radar system in which each transmission      consists of two pulses of different frequencies in succession. The echo      signals for each of the different frequencies are processed separately,      although in a like manner, thus doubling the number of independent samples      of sea echo available for estimating median range rate. The processing      will select slightly different rejection filters because of the difference      in Doppler frequency of the corresponding echo signals. However, due to      the design of the preferred embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, a change in      carrier frequency does not hinder the operation of the invention because      frequency compensation is provided. </PAR><PAR>  The many features and advantages of the present invention are apparent from      the detailed specification and thus it is intended by the appended claims      to cover all such features and advantages of the invention which fall      within the true spirit and scope thereof. Further, since numerous      modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art,      it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and      operation illustrated and described, and accordingly all suitable      modifications and equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the      scope of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
