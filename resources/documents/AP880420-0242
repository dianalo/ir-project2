They quoted Danish envoy Otto Broch as saying at Wednesday'sweekly session of NATO ambassadors he preferred that the ministersnot hold their April 27-28 meeting in Kolding, Denmark, asscheduled.   ``Instead, the meeting will be held in Brussels,'' said onesource.   The sources spoke on condition of not being identified.   A Danish official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,said the change of venue ``was agreed to in consultation with the(NATO) secretary- general'' and the other NATO members.   ``The decision was reached, of course, in light of the electionsituation in Denmark.''   Another source said the NATO envoys expressed ``seriousconcern'' about the Danish Parliament's passing a resolution lastweek asking the government to tighten its ban on nuclear arms.   NATO Secretary-General Lord Carrington said in a statement theresolution, if implemented ``would have serious repercussions andwould run counter ... to NATO strategy.''   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Poul Schlueter called for earlyelections May 10. His minority center-right government opposed theresolution.   It requires the government to tell visiting warships they cannotbring nuclear arms into Danish ports. For 31 years, Denmark has hada policy of banning nuclear arms from its soil.   Denmark also does not allow the permanent basing of alliedtroops on its territory.   North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials say the resolutiontakes the nuclear ban position too far and is embarrassing toDenmark's allies.   The United States and Britain, which would play a key role inreinforcing Denmark at a time of crisis, as a matter of policynever confirm or deny their warships carry nuclear arms.   Carrington's statement said the resolution ``would run counterto the basis of NATO strategy'' and undermines ``the principles ofshared burdens and benefits.''   In 1984, New Zealand began insisting that visiting warshipsstate whether they carried nuclear arms. This led to a cutoff ofits military cooperation with some other nations, including theUnited States.   The NATO defense ministers will meet as the alliance's NuclearPlanning Group which reviews only nuclear arms issues.   At the ambassadors meeting, U.S. envoy Alton Keel restated theReagan administration's ``deep regret'' over passage of theresolution, sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
