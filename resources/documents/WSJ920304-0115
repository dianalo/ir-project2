On Monday, Justice HarryBlackmun couldn't believe that a South Carolina law barringconstruction made $1 million of beach-front land worthless.&quot;Would you be willing to give it to me?&quot; Justice Blackmunasked. &quot;I don't own it,&quot; the lawyer said, &quot;but with the taxesowed on it, I would give it to you if I did.&quot;   Under this approach, every justice on the court could havehis pick of beach homes, farmland designated as wetlands andsavings-and-loans that went bust when regulators changed therules on them. If the justices don't think it's right forthem to accept private property this way, they have thechance to make other parts of the government just as wary.</LP><TEXT>   The South Carolina case is the highest-profile lawsuitagainst legislators and regulators who've ignored the TakingsClause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. This saysthe government can take property for a public purpose, butonly if taxpayers compensate the owner.   The facts in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council makeit clear that years of judicial indifference to propertyrights have encouraged regulators to take first, answerquestions later. David Lucas bought two plots of land butbefore he could build, the state adopted a new policy toprotect the beach. This barred Mr. Lucas from building morethan a pup tent, but offered him no compensation.   The state can ban beach-front construction, but why shouldMr. Lucas bear the full cost of a rule aimed at protectingthe homes of his neighbors up and down the street? As JusticeSandra O'Connor put it during the oral argument, the state'sno-pay reasoning could just as easily throw people out oftheir already built homes without compensating them.   The justices will have to work out how to protect propertypretty much on their own. The U.S. government filed asurprisingly incoherent brief in Lucas, reflecting whathappened when Solicitor General Kenneth Starr felt obliged tolet pro-regulation environmental lawyers in the JusticeDepartment muddy up the constitutional argument in favor ofMr. Lucas. Richard Epstein, the University of Chicago lawprofessor and author of &quot;Takings,&quot; filed a legal argumentthat would restore economic liberties to full civil-rightsprotection.   As the Supreme Court decides Lucas and otherproperty-rights cases this term -- one involving adevelopment dispute in Puerto Rico, another a rent-controlfight in California -- the justices might consult the work ofthe federal court whose full-time job is deciding propertycases. This is the little-known U.S. Claims Court, whereplaintiffs can go for monetary damages from Uncle Sam.   The court's chief judge, Loren Smith, just sent amultibillion-dollar message to savings-and-loans regulators.Last month Judge Smith ruled that Winstar Corp. and otherthrifts can sue the U.S. for contract breach and takingsbased on FIRREA, the 1989 law Congress passed supposedly tofix the thrifts' problems.   Regulators persuaded Winstar to take over a failingMinnesota thrift in 1984. The feds didn't have the cash tomake the investment worth Winstar's risk, so part of thenon-cash benefit was a pledge of favorable accountingtreatment for &quot;supervisory good will.&quot; But the 1989 lawrevoked this accounting method retroactively, violating thecontract, taking property and putting Winstar's thrift out ofbusiness.   Judge Smith hasn't issued his formal ruling yet, but hewill answer No Way to the legal issue Winstar framed in itslawsuit: &quot;Whether the federal government may enter into acontract with the plaintiffs, receive the benefit ofplaintiffs' complete performance of their obligations underthe contract, then renege by refusing to perform itsobligations under the contract while retaining all of thebenefits conferred by the plaintiffs.&quot;   Glenfed Inc., a $20 billion California thrift, has asimilar case before Judge Smith seeking $750,000. CaliforniaFederal Bank, the nation's fourth-largest thrift, has alsosued in the Claims Court asking for $500 million in losses.There are also lawsuits by thrifts such as Far West Federalof Portland, Ore., where thrift regulators signed explicitcontracts ensuring investors that their deal would stand&quot;notwithstanding any subsequent changes in the definition ofregulatory capital.&quot;   There will be other lawsuits by thrifts. Imagine if thegovernment told homeowners there were toxic poisons undertheir houses, forcing them to sell at low prices. Then itturned out there was no poison after all. Would thehomeowners be able to sue?   This is precisely what FIRREA did to savings-and-loansthat owned junk bonds. The law forced the thrifts to marktheir bonds to market and sell them quickly, causing atemporary slump in junk-bond prices. Despite continuingskepticism from the regulators who brought us the creditcrunch, once the dust settled junk bonds again becameexcellent investments.   As Glenn Yago writes on the opposite page today, ColumbiaSavings andamp; Loan of California is a prime victim (see relatededitorial: &quot;The Regulatory Reign of Terror&quot; -- WSJ March 4,92). His review of Columbia's portfolio found that ifregulators hadn't forced Columbia to junk its junk, it wouldhave shown a big profit by the end of 1991. Can Columbia'sowners sue for a taking?   It's worth a try, especially if they sue in the ClaimsCourt. Judge Smith, who was appointed by President Reagan in1985, has written several other opinions that haveproperty-rights groups cheering.   He wrote two opinions that said the Takings Clauserequires compensation when regulators decide land is a&quot;wetland.&quot; In one, he demanded compensation for a New Jerseydeveloper when regulators barred construction of new homes bydeclaring his land a wetland; Loveladies Harbor v. U.S.(1988). Judge Smith also ruled there must be compensationwhen a firm could not mine for limestone on what wasreclassified as a wetland; Florida Rock Industries v. U.S.(1988).   Judge Smith also ordered $150 million in compensation to aWyoming coal company when the Interior Department barredmining in a certain area; Whitney Benefits v. U.S. (1989).The Justice Department tried to get the Supreme Court toreverse Judge Smith's opinion, but failed.   It's not surprising that an era of reregulation would makethe job of the chief judge of the Claims Court one of themost important in government. Holding the government liablefor its actions is about more than fairness. It's also aboutlimiting the damage government can do to markets.   The Founders of this country understood that politiciansand bureaucrats might be tempted to risk policies that harmedeconomic growth by taking away private property, whetherland, coal or junk bonds. This is why they insisted thattaxpayers must be willing to pay for any property thegovernment takes -- the core of the Takings Clause -- as alimit on the damage government can do.</TEXT></DOC>
