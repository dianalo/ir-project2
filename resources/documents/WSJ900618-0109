The act would overhaul federal housing programs.   The bill would create a new Housing OpportunityPartnership, or HOP, which would expand housing for the poorthrough rehabilitation and new construction using governmentand private-sector funding. The legislation also includesadministration proposals to help low-income persons buy theirown homes, including units currently in the public housingstock.   Ten HUD programs, including urban homesteading, rentalrehabilitation and public housing construction, would beconsolidated into HOP, which is &quot;designed to be one flexibledelivery system carrying out many of the purposes of older,more narrowly focussed programs,&quot; according to a report bythe Senate's housing and urban affairs subcommittee.   In a letter to subcommittee Chairman Alan Cranston (D.,Calif.), Mr. Kemp said federally financed newhousing-construction measures &quot;will run into troublesomesystemic scandals, inadequate targeting to the poor andmanagement crises.&quot; The secretary has made similar criticismsabout legislation approved by a House committee this pastweek. Final action on the Senate's measure is expected thisweek.   The Cranston subcommittee report said that &quot;a blanketposition against new production is too simplistic to be aresponsible national housing policy.&quot;   HUD scandals involving political favoritism, influencepeddling and corruption didn't result from new housingconstruction efforts, according to the report. &quot;On thecontrary, individuals implicated in the scandals were amongthe most vocal opponents of federal assistance for housingconstruction,&quot; the report said. It said that already-passedlegislation eliminates certain conditions that led to thescandal and that the proposed legislation provides foradditional protections.   Mr. Kemp said he favors using the community developmentblock grant program to provide rental and home-ownershipassistance to low-income families and to assist state andlocal governments in the rehabilitation of the existinghousing stock.   He added that &quot;private-sector construction can offerdramatic new additions to affordable housing&quot; if only stateand local governments eliminated such barriers as rentcontrols, exclusionary zoning, high user fees, andunnecessary environmental and land-use regulations.&quot;   &quot;These government imposed barriers can add tens ofthousands of dollars to the cost of affordable housing,pricing moderate and low-income people out of themarketplace,&quot; he wrote.   The housing bill, which is being considered by the fullSenate earlier than expected, doesn't include Federal HousingAdministration restructuring plans that Mr. Kemp recentlyproposed. Those proposals are designed to keep FHA's largestfund, which insures mortgages with low down payments, fromgoing broke by the end of the decade.</TEXT></DOC>
