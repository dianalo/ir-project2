Alsonarco-terrorism was a part of it,'' FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerichsaid about the increased security for Thornburgh.   The attorney general has been using an armor-plated limousine,which cost more than $100,000, for three or four weeks, saidJustice Department spokesman David Runkel. He also has been using abasement entrance at the department instead of the street-leveldoor he had been using, Runkel said.   Both Ahlerich and Runkel declined to say whether Colombia's waron drugs was a specific factor. Colombia began a crackdown on drugtraffickers in mid-August.   ``There has been since mid-August a heightened concern forsecurity,'' Runkel said. He would not say whether there had beenany specific threats against Thornburgh.   The U.S. Marshals Service has assigned a permanent securitydetail to protect Bennett, said spokesman Bill Dempsey.   The security, Dempsey said, was ``not solely because of theColombian situation, but partly'' the result of it.   The Marshals Service, which is responsible for protectingfederal courthouses, is tightening security in jurisdictions whereColombian drug traffickers face charges.   ``We are taking necessary security steps throughout the country,but we are not going into a discussion of degrees of what we aredoing specifically, Dempsey said.   One Colombian has been extradited to the United States oncharges of laundering money for the Medellin cartel since the SouthAmerican government began its crackdown.   Three other Colombians wanted on U.S. charges are awaitingextradition.</TEXT></DOC>
