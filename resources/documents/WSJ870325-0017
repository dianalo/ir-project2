As previously reported, Mr. Cassoni wants to make the unit, Data Systems, profitable within two years. While the unit may be ahead of internal projections so far, securities analysts warn that it and ATandamp;T's other product groups typically are ahead in the first two months of the year because of the way ATandamp;T sets budgets. Still, at his first major ATandamp;T news conference since being named to head the computer division, Mr. Cassoni yesterday said the unit is moving faster than he expected toward the black.    ATandamp;T was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with 7.5 million shares changing hands. It closed at $25.125, up 25 cents, in composite trading.    ATandamp;T also announced price cuts of 12% to 25% on certain 3B minicomputers to make them more competitive with those of Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.    As expected, the company announced a new 3B2/600 minicomputer and a host of software and hardware that upgrades ATandamp;T's local area networks and provides better connections to IBM machines.    Consultants who saw Mr. Cassoni's presentation earlier this week said none of the products themselves were earthshaking, but together show ATandamp;T still wants to make a go of the computer business. The business last year had a loss of more than $1 billion before taxes, ATandamp;T sources say. Some consultants found software for 3B2 machines that provides greater connectivity to IBM as significant. Also viewed as important was software providing document exchange between different vendors' machines and ATandamp;T's electronic mail system.    But, as described by Mr. Cassoni, ATandamp;T's latest computer strategy doesn't differ much from that of the past three years. ATandamp;T still is stressing what it believes to be its unique ability to connect computers -- because of its telephone experience. In minicomputers, ATandamp;T still is pushing Unix, a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system developed by ATandamp;T's Bell Labs unit. And Mr. Cassoni, like his predecessor, James Edwards, also talked about serving customers' needs.    Critics, including managers who have quit, often note that ATandamp;T's computer difficulties have stemmed less from product problems and ideas about how to compete than from trouble executing. Customers have complained that salesmen don't know the products and that servicemen can't fix them.    Still, Mr. Cassoni hasn't been idle trying to fix these problems since succeeding Mr. Edwards last fall. Data Systems has cut employment to 5,000 from 8,000 since September, executives said, has consolidated product marketing and development efforts and has forced managers to pay more attention to how they are measured against internal profit, sales and other goals.    Data Systems used to have 10 separate business units &quot;each seeking its own destiny,&quot; Mr. Cassoni said. Now, Data Systems has three main product groups -- workstations, data networks, and minicomputers -- as well as another group working on the Unix system, shrinking the number of major profit centers to three from 10.    Product strategy is more defined; workstations made by Ing. C. Olivetti S.p.A., Mr. Cassoni's former employer, will adhere to IBM's personal computer standards while ATandamp;T minicomputers will run on Unix. The company will continue linking its own local area networks with others in the market, Mr. Cassoni said.    To better sell products, Mr. Cassoni has assigned 500 employees to develop computer sales brochures and other support for ATandamp;T's 600 direct computer salespeople. And in June, ATandamp;T will expand use of its credit card to offer a 16% revolving credit line usable to buy ATandamp;T computers and phones, managers said.    Nonetheless, ATandamp;T's strategies have risks. By following IBM in workstations, ATandamp;T has made that part of its strategy hostage to IBM's moves. Mr. Cassoni acknowledged greater acceptance of the Unix system doesn't necessarily mean greater acceptance of ATandamp;T's Unix machines. Only 14% of installed computers using the Unix operating system are ATandamp;T machines.    &quot;The big question is what are they going to make money from?&quot; said David Taylor of Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based consultant. ATandamp;T's presence in computers helps generate computer traffic for the profitable long distance network, he said. &quot;But I don't think computers (themselves) will ever be really profitable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
