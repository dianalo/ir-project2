Today, he is among a new breed of globe-trotting Soviet activistsflocking to the West to pitch their causes, attend seminars, meetgovernment leaders and finally shake hands with people whosestubborn support kept many of them going.   Unlike Soviet tourists and emigrants, these activists also areforging new contacts with people who will support them when theyreturn home. Along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donatedcomputers, printers and FAX machines to open new, electronic windowson the once-closed Soviet society.   The number of activists visiting the West has soared since 1986,the year after President Mikhail Gorbachev launched his reforms.They range from veteran Moscow dissidents who spent years in jailfor their beliefs to pro-independence Baltic activists spurred byGorbachev's programs.   Nearly every top leader of the three independent ``popularfront'' groups in the Baltic republics has visited Europe, theUnited States or Canada in the last year. Leading Moscow activistssuch as Lev Timofeyev and Sergei Kovalyov have crossed bothcontinents, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov hasreturned to the West twice since his first visit last year.   But Soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas forpersonal and business trips, leaving wide speculation about theKremlin's motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freelyabroad.   ``I'd shy away from conspiracy theories, but it obviously buildsup Gorbachev's reputation. He obviously believes enough in hisreforms to allow this,'' said Ginte Damusis of the LithuanianInformation Center in New York.   ``Gorbachev wants to appear as a peaceful ... law-abidingfigure,'' said Ludmilla Thorne, Soviet affairs director at the NewYork-based human rights organization Freedom House. ``They don'twant bad publicity.''   Jeri Laber, executive director of Helsinki Watch in New York,suggested the Kremlin simply is less concerned about activists'influence. ``Somebody there has realized it's not so bad when thesepeople speak out.''   A Soviet Embassy spokesman in Washington said only that Kremlimpolicy on visas for travel to the West doesn't discriminate betweenactivists and all other Soviet travelers, whose total number couldreach 2 million this year.   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the Lithuanian independencemovement Sajudis, said he didn't know why authorities let him visitthe United States and Europe, but that he had more important thingson his mind.   ``There is an opportunity to maintain contacts, to establish newcontacts,'' the 56-year-old musicologist said through an interpreterlast month in New York. ``I hope that Sajudis will be known not justby name only, but as a very real movement and representative of itspeople, its nation.''   Landsbergis, who became an activist only in the last two years,said his trip reaffirmed Sajudis' rejection of Soviet authority,imposed on the Baltics under a 1939 pact signed by Josef Stalin andAdolf Hitler.   ``We're raising questions about the authority of ourrepresentatives abroad. Can we expect emigres or other governmentsto represent us?''   He met with State Department officials, congressmen, a formerWhite House policymaker and Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO,which has appointed a representative to deal with Lithuania'sfledgling independent labor union.   Just a few weeks before, the 48-year-old Grigoryants met withVice President Dan Quayle and other officials and activists andsigned an agreement with Freedom House to fax daily installments ofhis journal to America.   Grigoryants, the Georgian publisher of the journal Glasnost, wasfreed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing anunderground journal. He formally came to America to accept theGolden Pen of Freedom Award from the International Association ofIndependent Journalists.   A State Department spokeswoman would not comment on any of themeetings, saying only that U.S. policy is to meet with all Sovietactivists.   ``One of their intentions for contacts with the West is to be sowell known that if a crackdown came, they'd be well known enough toprotect themselves,'' said Martin Zvaners of the American LatvianAssociation in Washington. ``The fact that these people are comingto the West, showing their faces, gives (Westerners) a stakepersonally in their fate.''   The activists also are ``seeing us working and they get an ideaabout how they could work. They see participation in a realparliamentary democracy,'' said Robert Van Voren, director of theBukovsky Foundation in Amsterdam.   But ideas and contacts aren't the only things activists take home.   Grigoryants handed Thorne a list of supplies, from staples tocomputers, for his Moscow office, which was stripped by KGB agentsand Internal Security forces last year. Thorne said she wasn't sureif all his requests were filled, but that his wife, Tamara, earlierin the year had carried a personal computer back to Moscow aftervisiting the West.   Landsbergis picked up a desktop publishing system with whichSajudis hopes to put out a daily newspaper from Vilnius, theLithuanian capital.   Baltic, Armenian and Georgian activists regularly use faxmachines they got from the West to send dispatches to Westernactivists, the recipients said.   ``One fax can perform miracles,'' said Eduard Gudava, executivedirector of the New York-based Center for Democracy in the U.S.S.R.``They can stop all this travel. ... But they cannot cut all thetelephone lines.''   The center receives daily dispatches from the human rightsjournal Express-Khronika and translates them for Western media. Suchindependent reporting will make Moscow think twice before sendingtroops against protesters, Gudava said.   ``It's impossible now to keep information inside the Soviet Unionabout such things,'' he said.   Still, nothing can replace face-to-face contact, said Van Voren.``They would be doing their jobs even without these trips. But it'seasier to discuss things in person _ you know, they still have bugsin their offices.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 30</NOTE></DOC>
