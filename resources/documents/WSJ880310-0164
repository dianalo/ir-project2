ITOH andamp; CO. and Japan's NATIONAL FEDERATION OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE ASSOCIATIONS plan to acquire CONSOLIDATED GRAIN andamp; BARGE CO., or CGB, of the U.S.    The Japanese parties said the acquisition probably would cost $40 million to $50 million. A C. Itoh official said a formal agreement may be signed as early as April. CGB declined comment.    The buyers said the acquisition of CGB, a grain storage and shipping specialist, would enhance stable grain flows to Japan from the U.S. The agricultural federation ships 3.3 million tons of U.S. corn and 750,000 tons of soybeans annually to Japan through a unit in New Orleans. </TEXT></DOC>
