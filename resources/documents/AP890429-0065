The suit was filed Friday but a hearing was postponed until May9, said Taffy Adler, a spokesman for the Chemical WorkersIndustrial Union, which represents 1,200 of Mobil's 1,500 SouthAfrican black workers.   Mobil Corp., which has done business in South Africa for 90years, announced Friday it was leaving the racially-divided nation.   The oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at morethan $400 million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. for more than$155 million in cash and $10 million that was expected to be theoperation's 1989 profit.   ``Far from being moral or politically progressive, Mobil hasseriously disadvantaged its work force by selling to one of themost notoriously anti-union South African corporations,'' the unioncommunique said.   The union said company officials earlier told them they had nointention of selling South African operations and promised todiscuss withdrawal procedures with the union ``if it becomes anissue.''   ``The most recent refusal by Mobil to negotiate because`disinvestment is not an issue' is in a letter dated Feb. 131989,'' the union said. ``It is inconceivable that Mobil had notbegun the process which would lead to disinvestment from SouthAfrica.''   Recently, the union approached foreign companies, includingMobil, with demands in the event of a sellout.   Among the requests were a 12-month advance notice and guaranteesof job security. In the Mobil case, the union has also said itwants details of the sale agreement and has insisted future profitsfrom licensing and franchising the company name in South Africa gointo a union trust, Adler said.   The chief executive of Mobil's South Africa operation, RobertAngel, said Friday there would be no immediate change in employmentpolicies or benefits when the company is turned over to the GeneralMining Union Corp., a South African conglomerate.   He and General Mining officials have said all existingagreements with the union would be honored and Mobil wouldcontinue, until at least 1994, to fund a foundation that supportscommunity development programs in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
