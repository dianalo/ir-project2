An Upjohn spokesman said there were no deaths associatedwith the tests. &quot;We voluntarily halted clinical tests ofHemopure,&quot; the name of the blood substitute now in the firststages of clinical testing, the spokesman said. &quot;The testswill resume when the questions have been answered. It's toopreliminary and proprietary in nature to discuss the medicalevents.&quot; Upjohn had licensed the drug from Biopure Corp. ofBoston.</LP><TEXT>   Industry analysts expressed mixed reactions to the news,which was reported by Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.James P. Keeney, analyst at Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co. said helowered his rating to a less aggressive buy from anaggressive buy, pending resolution of the clinical tests.   Upjohn stock closed at $48.25 a share, down 50 cents, inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.   But Mary Ellen McCarthy, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers, played down the significance of the announcement,noting that Hemopure wasn't even expected to hit the marketuntil the late 1990s.   Still, this represents the second setback for Upjohn's newproduct program this year. In March, the company suffered ablow when the U.S. patent for Genetics Institute Inc.'serythropoeitin, or EPO, was invalidated. Upjohn and ChugaiPharmaceuticals Ltd. licensed EPO from Genetics Institute,and the two planned to jointly market the red blood stimulantas Marogen in the U.S.   Two of Upjohn's key products -- Xanax, a tranquilizer, andHalcion, a sleeping pill -- are set to lose their U.S. patentprotection in 1993. Analysts estimate that the two drugscombined represent 30% of Upjohn's profits and 15% of itssales.   Mr. Keeney said Upjohn has only two other &quot;potentiallybig&quot; products in the pipeline now that Marogen has beenbumped as a significant challenger and Hemopure isquestionable. He said one is a heart attack drug and theother is a product to increase milk-production in cows.   Ms. McCarthy said Upjohn's announcement late yesterdaythat it reached an agreement with Hoechst-RousselPharmaceuticals Inc. to jointly develop and market a drugcalled glimepiride, used in the treatment ofnon-insulin-dependent diabetes, &quot;has significant potential&quot;as a replacement for Upjohn's anti-diabetes agent Micronase.The patent for Micronase is set to expire in 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
