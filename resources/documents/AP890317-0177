Hull, 69, a Costa Rican citizen and rancher born in Evansville,Ind., spoke to reporters for the first time since Costa Ricanbrought charges against him two months ago.   He said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the CentralIntelligence Agency and U.S. congressional committees all havecleared him of wrongdoing after investigations.   ``I'll repeat that this case is no more than a political-economicplot against me,'' Hull declared. He said Costa Rica was embarrassedby revelations in the Iran-Contra scandal that some Contra supplieswent through Costa Rica and is prosecuting him as a scapegoat.   On Jan. 13, Hull was charged with allowing a runway on his ranchnear the Nicaraguan border to be used for shipping drugs to theUnited States, the money to be used to buy arms for the U.S.-backedNicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.   He spent two months in jail before being freed on $37,500 bondbecause of poor health following a heart attack.   At his ranch is a 1,800-foot strip where, the government alleges,drug-laden planes left for Miami.   Hull's lawyer, Juan Jose Sobrado, who appeared with him Friday,said planes carrying drugs need a bigger runway and that thegovernment confused the Hull ranch with another landing strip nearby.   ``Surely (George) Morales confused Hull's landing strip with thatof Llano Grande, four kilometers (2{ miles) to the north wherelarger planes can land or take off, where the runway is 8,000 feetlong,'' Sobrado said.   Testimony before the U.S. Congress said small planes used Hull'slanding strip for drug runs.   ``To carry cargos of 25,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,000 kilos(2,200 pounds) of cocaine, planes like Cessna 404 and 402 areneeded, which require runways at least 8,000 feet long and therunway on the Hull ranch is only 1,800 feet,'' the lawyer said.   Sobrado said Costa Rican authorities based their accusationsagainst Hull on statements Colombian drug trafficker George Moralesmade in an interview on CBS.   Hull himself cited an article published in July 1987 in The NewYork Times which he said called accusations against him ``politicalfantasies.''   He displayed the charges drawn against him by Costa Ricanauthorities which concluded, ``There is no assurance that drugs haveleft from John Hull's landing strip.''   ``Despite this conclusion, they have accused and jailed meunjustly in a case typical of political persecution,'' Hull said.``The only thing I did was provide humanitarian aid to theNicaraguan rebels that consisted of clothing, medicine and foodbetween 1984 and 1985 ... this was known by the then-president, LuisAlberto Monge, the minister of security and the rural police, andthis was public knowledge.''   The man who is Costa Rica's president now, Oscar Arias, won the1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts toward ending CentralAmerican conflicts in which Costa Rican policy is officially neutral.   Hull said that because of financial difficulties he has had toreduce the help on his ranch _ about 60 miles north of San Jose and30 miles from the Nicaraguan border _ from 100 to 70 people.   Hull cultivates oranges, pineapples, nuts and other fruits forexport.   ``The harvest has dropped considerably because the banks havedenied me credit for two years and exports have dropped,'' Hull said.   He said if Costa Rican authorities give permission, he will go tothe United States for a medical examination to see if he needs heartsurgery.   Sobrando complained the government has interfered with histelephone service since taking up the Hull case, but the lawyer saidthat otherwise he has not been pressured.</TEXT></DOC>
