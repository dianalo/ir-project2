The methods include SDS-polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), combined with immunoprecipitation and/orfluorography of [{sup 35}S]methionine-labeled translation products. Theother frequently used characterization tool, translation of hybrid-selectedmRNA or hybrid-arrested translation, is treated separately in this volume.Methods are also given for the recognition of mRNAs coding for secretedor membrane proteins.</TEXT></DOC>
