The deposition from the late Philippine ruler was played in awrongful-death lawsuit filed by the families of Silme Domingo andGene Viernes, who were shot in offices of the Alaska CanneryWorkers Union here in June 1981.   Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that thevictims were working to eliminate gang influence on workassignments and gambling in Alaska fish canneries.   The U.S. District Court lawsuit, however, claims the murder plotactually was hatched in Manila because of Domingo's and Viernes'anti-Marcos activism.   The plaintiffs claim $15,000 was paid for the murders from anintelligence slush fund that was administered by a company, theMabuhay Corp. of San Francisco, which was run by Dr. LeoniloMalabed.   Marcos has admitted Malabed was a friend, but invoked his FifthAmendment privilege against self-incrimination on all questionsregarding intelligence funding and the Mabuhay company.   He gave his deposition during two sessions in 1986 and 1987,after he fled to Hawaii following the February 1986 overthrow ofhis government. Marcos died last September.   Marcos, his wife, Imelda, the Philippine government and othersare defendants in the suit, which seeks $30 million in damages.   The questions Marcos would not answer were:   _Whether the Philippines National Bank was used to channel moneyto the United States for intelligence operations in the late 1970sand 1980s.   _Whether he authorized the use of up to $1 million in PNB moneyto create the Mabuhay Corp.   _Whether PNB money went to Mabuhay and was used ``to conductacts of physical violence against the anti-Marcos opposition ...including and up to the use of murder, political assassination andsummary execution.''   _Whether he was aware of Malabed's effort to buy a radiostation, the purpose for which Mabuhay allegedly was established.   Marcos also refused to answer when asked directly whetherMabuhay was used as an ``intelligence slush fund'' that provided$15,000 on May 17, 1981, for the Domingo and Viernes murders. Thatexchange was disallowed by U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothsteinand edited out of the video, but included in the full transcript ofthe deposition.   Among the key documents in the trial is one that plaintiffsclaim is an Mabuhay account sheet for the slush fund. Under aheading for ``security projects'' is a May 17 entry for $15,000.   Plaintiffs claim former cannery-union president ConstantineBaruso, whose gun was used in the killings, was in San Francisco onthat date to pick up the money. Baruso, who was never criminallycharged in the murders, also invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 timesduring his testimony earlier in the lawsuit trial.   In testimony shown Wednesday for a 1986 deposition session,Marcos admitted four Philippine intelligence agencies operated inthe United States during his martial-law regime, but he denied theywould have used strong-arm tactics. He said he didn't becomeconcerned about anti-Marcos opposition in the United States untilabout 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
