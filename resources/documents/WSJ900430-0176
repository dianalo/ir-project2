Hisopening words to a &quot;Welcome Home&quot; rally here yesterday --&quot;Comrades, we are together at last&quot; -- were greeted with wildcheers.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Slovo didn't return so much as a prophet of Marxas he did a fellow traveler in the struggle against the whitegovernment and its policies of racial segregation known asapartheid. Mr. Slovo is the highest-ranking white person inthe African National Congress, the mass-based blackliberation movement, and at one time he was the leader of theANC's exile-based armed wing. Now, he returns as one of the11 ANC leaders who will engage the government in three daysof historic talks, beginning Wednesday, aimed at clearing theway for negotiations on black-white power-sharing.   &quot;We have come to talk to the government in the spirit ofconciliation,&quot; Mr. Slovo told the mass rally on a wind-sweptsoccer field in a colored, or mixed-race, township outside ofCape Town. An ANC flag fluttered to his right, a CommunistParty flag (a hammer and sickle within a red star) to hisleft. &quot;If there is a way forward without bloodshed,&quot; he said,&quot;we will grab it with both hands.&quot;   But, in so doing, the ANC isn't about to let go of itsdemands for a new constitutional order. Mr. Slovo made itclear that the ANC won't compromise on its bottom-line goalsof one-man, one-vote simple majority rule and aredistribution of the country's wealth and land, which isconcentrated in white hands. The government opposes simplemajority rule, claiming that it would lead to blackdomination (blacks outnumber whites more than five to one),and it dismisses redistribution as &quot;theft.&quot;   To get to those issues, though, both sides will first haveto create a climate suitable for constitutional talks. TheANC demands that the government lift the four-year-old stateof emergency and release all political prisoners. Pretoria,which legalized the ANC and the Communist Party in Februaryafter a three-decade ban, insists the ANC give up its armedstruggle. Both sides say this week's talks may just be thebeginning of efforts to clear away the obstacles to realnegotiation.   In the three months since President F.W. de Klerk's movesto free up the country's political activity, the level ofnationwide violence has soared. Protesters taking advantageof the new opportunities have at times been met by strongpolice resistance, particularly in the rural areas. The &quot;Zuluwars&quot; in the Natal province, where the ANC and the moreconservative Zulu political movement known as Inkatha arefighting for political supremacy, have intensified.   At the same time, the ANC and the government are underpressure from their constituencies not to concede too much atnegotiations. The Pan Africanist Movement, which says blacksshould just seize power and not bother with negotiations,accuses the ANC of selling out black interests and ofappeasing Pretoria. On the other hand, the virulent whiteright wing accuses the government of surrendering whiteinterests to the blacks.   &quot;We know negotiation is a question of give and take,&quot; Mr.Slovo said. &quot;But there is a limit to what one side gives andwhat one side takes. This is the gap that needs to be closedby dialogue.&quot;   Mr. Slovo's words, carried far by the strong winds, wereechoed by cries of &quot;Viva&quot; from the crowd. For years, the nameof this 64-year-old white man has been shouted in the samebreath as the names Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, theANC's two paramount leaders. And, during the years of banningand exile, the Communist Party's surge in popularity hasmirrored that of the ANC. &quot;The enemy of our enemy is ourfriend,&quot; said a young black man when asked why he was wavinga Communist Party flag. &quot;Slovo,&quot; in big capital letters, wasemblazoned on a sticker plastered across the front of hissweater.   In the white community, though, Mr. Slovo's return toSouth Africa is causing more angst than the release of Mr.Mandela from prison in February. Because he's white, Mr.Slovo's actions have always seemed more treacherous, hiscalls for black liberation more ominous. He, more so than Mr.Mandela, has been the whites' most-feared bogeyman. And nowthat he's back, many whites are studying him closely toconfirm their fears. When he flew into the country Friday,the pro-government media jumped on the fact that he waswearing red socks. No one chronicled what the black ANCmembers were wearing.   The government is hoping that the events in Eastern Europewill discredit Mr. Slovo and his party. But the stocky,gray-haired lawyer, who was born in Lithuania, seems to beadapting with the times. Once a hard-line Stalinist, Mr.Slovo recently examined communism's shortcomings in an essayentitled &quot;Has Socialism Failed?&quot; Yesterday, he warned Mr. deKlerk that the tide of liberation sweeping across EasternEurope is also sweeping across South Africa. He praised therole of the churches in the anti-apartheid struggle, callingon &quot;every good believer to become a witness for liberation.&quot;He said the ANC has displayed &quot;the Biblical patience of Job&quot;in its long battle against Pretoria. He embraced multipartydemocracy. He talked about redistributing wealth and hailedthe contribution of the working class, but he didn't railabout economic nationalization.   Make no mistake, he said in private, socialism is stillhis goal for South Africa. But, he added, first things first.   &quot;When we left (South Africa) in 1963, the main slogan was`Freedom in our lifetime,'&quot; he said. &quot;Today, our cry is`Freedom now.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
