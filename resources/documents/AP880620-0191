(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Firefighters poured neutralizingchemicals on barrels of chloride, and cheering residents returnedhome Monday after a four-day fire that spewed poisonous gas andforced evacuation of 25,000 people.   ``I'd like to thank the people for the patience they havedemonstrated,'' Mayor Richard E. Neal said. ``Throughout, ourprimary concern has been the public safety.''   About 275 people were injured and thousands camped out inshelters as explosions rocked the century-old mill housing theAdvanced Laboratories plant, which made chloride pellets forswimming pools.   Officials said the fire was among the worst in memory in thiscity of 170,000 people. No damage estimate was available, but Nealsaid city lawyers were ``agressively pursuing'' plans to recoupexpenses.   Residents waved to police and cheered as the first school buswith returning evacuees moved through a barricade about 1 p.m. Thelast of the evacuees returned home at 6:30 p.m. and only the streetin front of the plant remained closed, Fire Commissioner Darnell L.Williams said.   Two fire trucks and police patrols were to remain on the sceneovernight as crews worked to remove the containers of chlorinecompounds weighing up to 300 pounds, authorities said.   ``My roses are black and my tomatoes are dead,'' AntoinetteHarris, 37, said after returning home Monday. ``But the dog is allright.''   After more than 36 hours of flooding the factory with more than6,000 gallons of water a minute, barrels of chloride stoppedexploding Monday.   Clean-up crews then poured a solution of neutralizing chemicalson ``hot spots'' where the chloride compounds were decomposing andproducing toxic chlorine gas.   John Higgins, regional director of the state Department ofEnvironmental Quality Engineering, said firefighters shut off theirhoses briefly Sunday afternoon so officials could quickly tour theplant, but barrels of chloride started exploding again soonafterward.   Hoses from all city pumpers flooded the building until 6:15 a.m.Monday. By 8 a.m., no barrels had exploded, and the neutralizingmixture of boric acid and sodium sulfate was poured onto theremaining chloride barrels, some of which were bubbling.   State-contracted clean-up crews gingerly removed more than 8,000pounds of chlorine-containing compounds left in the building asfirefighters stood by Monday afternoon.   The material was taken to the city's sewage treatment plant andused in lieu of the chlorine the city normally buys for thefacility, Higgins said. ``At least that way the city can get backsome of the money it's spent,'' he said.   At the fire's peak Saturday night, flames shot 100 feet in theair and a cloud of poisonous gas 100 feet high, four blocks wideand three miles long streamed over Springfield and into neighboringChicopee. The fumes could be smelled 15 miles away.   In the cloud's path, trees and lawns were withered by thecorrosive gas.   ``What's going to happen to my garden?'' said Wavel Watson, wholives a few blocks from the plant. ``The annuals, the shrubs, thelawn _ everything is withered and I just put it all in three weeksago.''</TEXT></DOC>
