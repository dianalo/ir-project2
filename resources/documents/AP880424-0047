(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A cadre of officers has kept the peaceduring this year's Chippewa Indian spearfishing season, the fourthsince federal courts upheld the Indians' right to harvest resourceson lands the tribes ceded to the government.   Protests against the Indian fishing rights and their method oftaking large numbers of sport fish have been noisy and violent inprevious years, including shots fired at some lakes in 1986. Noserious injuries have been reported.   An argument between an Indian and an non-Indian over a trafficincident last week looked like it might turn into a scuffle, butIron County Sheriff Don Bungi quickly separated the two. When morespectators arrived, he called for backup officers, bringing in morethan a dozen squad cars.   The six-year veteran, who oversees a four-man department, hasbecome experienced in handling crowds during the controversialoff-reservation spearfishing season on lakes in northern Wisconsin.   Protesters consider spearing an unfair way of bagging thewalleyed pike and muskies that are a prime tourism attraction forsportsfishers.   An early show of force by police marked this spearfishingseason, and protests seem to have moved off the boat landings andonto the lakes.   Each night before sunset, a National Guard helicopter passesover the lakes. Police sometimes outnumber spectators. And newsigns announce that alcoholic beverages are prohibited on thelandings at night.   Federal court rulings have upheld Chippewa rights, retained in19th century treaties, to harvest resources _ including fishing,hunting, trapping and harvesting wild rice _ off the reservationson land the tribes ceded to the federal government.   Each band is allowed 15 days of spearing. Spearers may take nomore than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fishpopulation can tolerate. The season ends by May 6.   The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them find thefish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet in length.   On Saturday night, 11th night of the season, 123 Chippewaspearers took 3,088 fish despite cold weather and snow in someplaces.   Dave Daniel, a state Department of Natural Resources spokesmanat Woodruff, said there was no trouble at any site, although agroup of protesters did watch the Lac du Flambeau tribe spear atSquirrel Lake in Vilas County.   ``It was a very quiet last night,'' Daniels said. ``There wereprobably 40 or 45 protesters that showed up on Squirrel Lake. Butthey were peaceful and quiet and there to observe and that was it.''   Some critics have said the police presence is too costly andpossibly unwarranted.   ``The taxpayers have to pay for this,'' said Bill Schnautc ofButternut, a spearfishing opponent.   The state Division of Emergency Government estimated costs forthe first five days of the season at about $50,000, said DaveKunelius, a Natural Resources spokesman.   Local police, who began planning security in December, organizedtwo backup units of 30 officers each from other areas in the state.The backup units are stationed in northern Wisconsin during thespearfishing season.   At Butternut Lake _ the site last year of a protest thatrequired more than 150 officers to keep peace _ about 75 officerswere stationed on the boat landing before Indians or protestersarrived this year.   ``There's obviously some areas where we anticipated trouble,''said George Meyer, chief administrator of law enforcement for theDepartment of Natural Resources.   This year's problems have been mainly complaints thatspearfishermen have been harassed by non-Indian boats creatingwaves, shining lights and splashing water near them.   Gatherings at boat landings have been smaller this year thanlast, which authorities attribute partly to colder weather andpartly to more visible security.   ``I think it's great. We're getting cooperation from bothsides,'' Bungi said Friday. ``I think everything's going smoothly.''   Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau tribal judge and spearfishingorganizer, applauded the police effort but said he wished it wasnot needed.   ``It's just unfortunate that we have a lot of people watching usfish,'' he said. ``It's a shame that a few protesters have to costthe state of Wisconsin so much money.''  </TEXT></DOC>
