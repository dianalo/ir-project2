The move is what Bally called a &quot;first step&quot; towardshoring up its heavily leveraged balance sheet and improvingits stock price. Bally said it also is considering a varietyof asset sales, refinancings, joint ventures and othermeasures.</LP><TEXT>   The bonds, sold through Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. inJanuary 1986, have been trading at about 53 cents to 55 centson the dollar, Paul Johnson, Bally's chief financial officer,said. Bally offered 57 shares of its common stock for each$1,000 bond, or a total of about 7.7 million newly issuedshares if all the bonds are tendered. The company currentlyhas about 28 million shares outstanding.   Bally's stock tumbled $1.50 yesterday on the news to closeat $10.625 in Big Board trading.   Despite greatly increasingly the number of sharesoutstanding, Bally said the equity-for-debt swap wouldincrease per-share profit by reducing the company's debtload. The bonds, due January 2001, pay 13 5/8% interest, andare the company's costliest debt.   Bally had first-quarter profit of $7.6 million, or 21cents a share, compared with $11.8 million, or 37 cents ashare, a year earlier. Revenue was $551.3 million comparedwith $516.7 million. The company wouldn't project future 1990results or say how much per-share net would be increased bythe exchange.   In all, Bally has about $1.77 billion of long-term debt,Mr. Johnson said, and its 1989 interest expense was $206million. &quot;The market perception is that we had too muchdebt,&quot; he said.   Bally joins some other junk-bond issuers in trying to buyback its debt at a deep discount to the original price. Mr.Johnson said, however, that since the company is under nofinancial pressure to retire the bonds, it wouldn't sweetenthe offer. &quot;It's terribly unlikely we would do anythingelse,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
