The rating concern cited Fluorocarbon's increased use of debt to finance acquisitions. Moody's said the $60 million of debt added to the company's balance sheet this year &quot;has resulted in significantly greater financial leverage.&quot; However, it added, &quot;Fluorocarbon's relatively steady earnings growth, and the possible sale of excess assets, will help&quot; reduce debt. J. Michael Hagan, president, said, &quot;earnings from the acquisitions are more than covering the additional debt load.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
