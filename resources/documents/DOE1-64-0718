Genetic engineering requires isolation of genes, theirmultiplication in bacteria, their transfer to tree cells, and regenerationof the transformed cells into new trees. Success has already been achievedin cloning conifer genes and in developing a transfer system, and severalgenes of potential value to forestry have been isolated from bacteria.The inability to regenerate conifers from transformed cells is the majorremaining barrier to application of genetic engineering in tree improvement.</TEXT></DOC>
