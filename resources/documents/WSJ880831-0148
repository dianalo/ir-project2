CH-47D Chinook military helicopters, a Chinese military officer said, the Associated Press reported from Beijing. If the sale goes through, it would be one of China's largest direct military purchases from the U.S.    &quot;We haven't sold anything yet,&quot; a spokesman for the company's Boeing Helicopters division said in suburban Philadelphia. He said a U.S. Army Chinook helicopter recently had been lent to the Chinese for tests. &quot;We thought that the demonstrations went very well and we're continuing to talk to the Chinese&quot; about a possible sale, the spokesman said. He declined to discuss the AP report on the number of helicopters that Boeing might sell.    AP identified the Chinese company negotiating to buy the helicopters as Poly Technologies Inc., which has been involved in some of China's previous major purchases of military equipment from the U.S., including the $140 million purchase of 24 helicopters from United Technology Corp.'s Sikorsky Aircraft division in 1984. Poly Technologies has close connections to the Chinese leadership; its president, He Ping, is the son-in-law of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and the son of a top army official.    AP quoted a Boeing spokesman in Beijing as saying Chinooks cost about $15 million each, which would value the sale of a dozen craft at about $180 million. The Boeing spokesman in the U.S. said price would depend on how the helicopters were equipped, how many were bought and whether they were new or used. Chinooks are medium-lift troop-transport helicopters that can also move artillery and heavy engineering equipment.    The largest U.S.-China military contract, valued at $245 million, was signed last year with Grumman Corp., which contracted to upgrade the electronics system of China's F-8 fighter jet.    The Chinese military spokesman, who identified himself to the AP only as Mr. Kang, said China would use the Boeing helicopters as part of a program to upgrade a recently formed army rapid-deployment force. </TEXT></DOC>
