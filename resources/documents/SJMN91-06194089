Remember: Thecharge against Bork by those who eventually voted him down was never &quot;I don'tagree with his political views.&quot; That, of course, was the essence of theopposition to Bork, but even his opponents maintained publicly that it isimproper grounds on which to disqualify a Supreme Court nominee. (Whether ornot it ought to be is another question.);    Instead, the charge against Borkwas that he was not qualified to sit on the highest court. Not that he wasintellectually unqualified -- on that basis, he was then and remains nowprobably the most highly qualified jurist in the country -- but&quot;temperamentally&quot; unfit. A new charge was minted which became the basis forhis rejection by the Senate: He was &quot;out of the mainstream,&quot; a politicalextremist unfit to hold high office.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE GETTYSBURG OF PC BATTLES IS COMING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  CommentaryCharles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The attack on Bork was the first live-fire exercise of that essential, nowfamiliar PC weapon: stigmatizing as illegitimate those views (particularlyviews on race, gender, and sexuality) that do not conform to current liberalorthodoxy. Dissenters are not just considered conservative, but out of themainstream. Forty years ago, in the McCarthy era, the word was &quot;un-American.&quot;;   On a world scale, the tyranny to which such dissenters are subjected isfairly mild. You don't get put into the gulag. No one prevents you from goingon the lecture circuit. You are a welcome guest on the chat shows. But you maynot hold high office.;    Even not so high office. Critic Carol Iannone wasnominated last September to the advisory council of the National Endowment forthe Humanities. For months now she has been the subject of intense attack bythe politically correct literary establishment (the Modern LanguageAssociation, PEN, American Council of Learned Societies, etc.). Here again,those trying to block her nomination don't say they object because she ispolitically conservative and writes articles with which they disagree inplaces like Commentary. They say she is unqualified.;    The basis of herunqualification? The charge that she does not have the requisite academiccredentials is a phony. She holds a Ph.D. in literature and has taught it for20 years. She is a full-time faculty member at New York University. Her realoffense is having written that several books authored by blacks have beenhonored with awards not on merit but as a form of literary reparation.;    Theissue at stake in the Iannone nomination is whether it will be impermissiblein this country to say such a thing. Rejection would mean that the publicdiscussion of racial bias will be regulated by the liberal establishment. Thepublic discussion of discrimination against minorities is highly encouraged.The discussion of discrimination in favor of minorities is highly dangerous --it may be deemed such an act of deviance as to render the discussant unfit forpublic office.;    Now, however, yet another fight in the PC wars is loomingand if the Bork nomination was Fort Sumter this one looks to be Gettysburg.The nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court may turn out to be adecisive battle over whether certain conservative views will continue to bedelegitimized. The Thomas nomination will be a test of whether a black who isconservative can be part of the American mainstream.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910712  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  576  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 12, 199100194089,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
