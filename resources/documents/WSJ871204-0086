Gigot, a member of the Journal's editorial board. Mr. Gigot joined the Journal in 1980 and was a reporter in Chicago and Hong Kong before becoming editorial page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal in 1984. Last year, he was on leave from the Journal as a White House fellow, working in the White House and Treasury Department.}    Remember the &quot;shovel brigade&quot;? That's what former chief of staff Donald Regan called the White House aides whose public-relations skills retrieved &quot;success&quot; from the initial gloom of last year's Reykjavik summit. Mr. Regan's comments were roundly denounced at the time, but in fact his only offense was excessive candor. Shovel brigading, as Americans are now relearning, is in many ways the essence of summitry.    If that sounds cynical, consider President Reagan's recent speeches, especially his remarks to the conservative Heritage Foundation this week. Just a week before he's supposed to sit down with Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Reagan described the Soviet strategic defense program as a &quot;Red Shield,&quot; a metaphor his speechwriters had pulled from an article in Reader's Digest. The president also charged that the Soviets may be preparing a &quot;breakout&quot; from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, another new rhetorical twist. The Heritage crowd loved it, but Washington's neo-detentists winced -- the old cold-warrior was at it again.    Detentists can relax. President Reagan and his White House aides aren't about to do anything to poison next week's summit, because in fact they want it to succeed as much as Mikhail Gorbachev does. At Monday's cabinet meeting, Secretary of State George Shultz (he of the Reykjavik frown) couldn't have been more upbeat about summit prospects. He said the intermediate nuclear force treaty will be signed, and, addressing the president at one point, he even said there was a good chance to conclude a Start agreement on intercontinental missiles by spring.    This doesn't mean the president doesn't believe his iron-curtain oratory, of course. But it's best understood as only part of a broader White House strategy to set the stage for the summit -- to present the president as a man who wants peace, but who won't give away the store to get it. The president may sign a treaty with the Soviets, the message runs, but that doesn't mean he'll imitate President Carter and kiss them on the cheek too.    &quot;This is the rare case when our skeptics are not on the left, but on the right,&quot; explains a senior White House aide. &quot;The point we've tried to explain is that this treaty validates what we've been saying for six years -- that you succeed when you're strong.&quot;    That may be true, but White House aides also want the summit and INF treaty to succeed because the president is politically weak. Mr. Reagan has suffered a rough autumn, to put it mildly. On stage alone with Mr. Gorbachev, White House aides figure, the president can reassert his leadership. For once even Jim Wright won't share the spotlight. If INF is later ratified by the Senate, as White House aides assume it will be, then people may even stop whispering words like lame duck.    &quot;The key point is to get back on the winning track,&quot; says a senior Reagan adviser, &quot;and if this is the first thing we can use to get there, then so be it.&quot;    Senior White House aides take comfort in private polls that show the INF treaty has the support of more than 70% of Democrats and Republicans alike. They even went so far as to have Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin put together two focus groups, in Philadelphia, to further plumb public sentiments. Among other things, members of the focus groups informed them that they like the idea that the summit and treaty will promote peace. One result is that throughout next week the president will be characterizing the summit and treaty as a &quot;First Step for Peace.&quot;    On the other hand, say White House aides, the same polls show that the public is also skeptical of Soviet promises. So the president's harsher anti-Soviet rhetoric this week won't seem contradictory to most Americans, even as it also begins to address conservative fears about the INF treaty.    Are conservatives concerned about past Soviet treaty violations? The president told his Heritage listeners that the INF treaty will have &quot;the most stringent verification regime in the history of arms control.&quot;    Is he too eager for a treaty to regain his political popularity? &quot;We must never be afraid to walk away from a bad deal,&quot; the president said.    Will he sacrifice the strategic defense initiative in order to get an agreement to reduce intercontinental weapons? &quot;We will research it,&quot; he said about SDI. &quot;We will develop it. And when it is ready, we will deploy it.&quot;    If all of this seems like a delicate line to walk, well, apparently sometimes even the president slips. Speaking to a high school crowd in Jacksonville, Fla., on Tuesday, the president contrasted his own negotiations with the Soviets with the detente of the 1970s. The written text said, &quot;More than a decade ago, there was a warming in U.S.-Soviet affairs that we called 'detente.'&quot; The president misspoke, however, and instead of &quot;warming,&quot; he first said &quot;warning.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
