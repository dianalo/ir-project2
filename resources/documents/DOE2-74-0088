<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0088 </DOCNO><TEXT>Interaction between a quantum system and its environment can be oftenregarded as a measurement, in the course of which one of the system observablesinfluences the evolution of the external degrees of freedom and is thus``monitored'' by the environment. The resulting loss of quantum coherenceerases part of the density matrix responsible for the correlations betweenthe eigenstates of the monitored observable. This mechanism is very efficienteven in the limit of weak coupling. Indeed, the classical limit of quantumtheory---that is, both classically reversible equations of motion andclassical states (trajectories in phase space rather than their superpositions)can be naturally attained when both the coupling strength and the Planckconstant simultaneously tend to zero. Transition from quantum to classicalin the inflationary cosmological models can be justified in the frameworkof environment induced superselection. 24 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
