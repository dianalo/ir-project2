Demonstrators in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku called for astrike and another protest Monday if authorities fail to meet theirdemands, said Mamedgassan Gambarov, a member of the AzerbaijaniPeople's Front.   Gambarov, speaking by telephone from Baku, said other demandsentailed the recall of unpopular Azerbaijani deputies to the Sovietparliament and the cancellation of curfews throughout the Caucasusrepublic.   Moslem activist Almaz Yestekov said the front was asking for theremoval of Soviet troops from Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly ChristianArmenian enclave in traditionally Shiite Moslem Azerbaijan.   Disputes over the area, which neighboring Armenia wants toannex, have led to violence several times in the last 18 months,causing authorities to impose curfews and bring in troops to keeporder. Scores of people have been killed and thousands fled theirhomes.   Slogans at Saturday's protest included ``Karabakh and Azerbaijanare indivisible'' according to Yestekov, who said he heads afledgling news agency specializing in Moslem areas of the SovietUnion.   Activists said thousands of people attended the rally, but theygave no specific figure.   Speakers also called for authorities to give the People's Frontfull legal status as an organization, Yestekov said.   People's Front groups have sprung up in many of the 15 Sovietrepublics in an effort to push local demands for autonomy. Theyhave become especially strong in the Baltic republics.</TEXT></DOC>
