The stewardess, Ha Mina Hang, died of internal bleeding onSaturday, hospital officials said. She was among six people rescuedFriday from the wreckage of the Tu-134 aircraft that crashed fourmiles before it was to land at Don Muango International Airportduring a flight from Hanoi.   Among those killed in the crash was Vietnam's health minister,Dang Hoi Huan, and several diplomats.   Thai and Vietnamese investigators said Sunday they still don'tknow what caused the second worst air disaster in Thai history. OnAug. 31, 1987, a Thai Airways jetliner crashed into the sea off thesouthern resort island of Phuket, killing all 83 people aboard.   Authorities said the five survivors, including the captain,navigator, and mechanic of the plane, remained in intensive careSunday in local hospitals.   The head of the Thai investigating team, Srisook Chandrangsu,confirmed Thai news reports that the captain, Khong Dinh Phuong,stumbled out of the cockpit after the crash and asked a villagerfor a clean shirt and to use the telephone. He was the onlysurvivor who was rescued conscious.   Phuong earlier was quoted as saying the plane was struck bylightning.   The two inflight recorders containing flight data and the finalconversations between the crew and control tower have beenrecovered. The plane last made radio contact with the control towerone minute before it crashed, the general manager of theinternational airport said Sunday.   Weather officials at the airport said skies there were clear atthe time but that strong winds and heavy rains buffeted nearbyareas.   During its final radio contact, the plane was flying at about1,600 feet and was believed to have lowered its landing gear andwing flaps for an emergency landing, said the airport manager,Charoon Peetong.   Vietnamese Prime Minister Do Muoi sent a team of investigatorsto the site to work with Thai authorities in determining cause ofthe accident ``and to resolve all consequences arising therefrom,''state-run Radio Hanoi said Saturday.   Japan's Nihon television network Saturday quoted Vietnameseofficials as saying Vietnam's 16-member Olympic team canceled theirseats on the flight only two days earlier.   The Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok said the victims also includedVietnam's ambassador-designate to the Philippines, Nguyen DhuongVu, and several lower-ranking government officials.   Diplomats said the dead included India's ambassador to Vietnam,Arun Patwardhan, and seven officials of his embassy; the secondsecretary of Japan's embassy in Hanoi; and the second secretary ofthe Australian Embassy in Hanoi.   Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition.   The Tu-134, the Vietnamese flag carrier's main aircraft, is usedby the Soviet airline Aeroflot, although several have crashed inrecent years. One Tu-134 crashed in Siberia last February; anothercrashed in October 1986, killing Mozambique President Samora Machel.   The Japanese aviation magazine Kokujoho says the Tu-134, whichfirst flew in 1963, is no longer produced. Air Vietnam officialssay they would like to switch to newer, Western-made planes but donot have enough money.</TEXT></DOC>
