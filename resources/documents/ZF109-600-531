 The newestEmerald configuration was the Scangraphic Color-Star, a desktop version ofits earlier drum-based systems.andM;Also on hand were the Emeral's chief rivals in the speed derby: Hyphen,Harlequin and Linotype.andP;  Hyphen and Harlequin showed software RIPs running ona variety of platforms.andP;  Linotype demostrated its RIP 30 in conventionalmanner.andP;  At the low end, the Hell BridgIt appears ready to make a run, beingsold both by Hell and by Locker, which demostrated it at Graph Expo.andP;  Wediscussed Hell's latest BridgIt developments--PC and Sun versions--in ourcolor section.andM;Other highlights from the Seybold and Graph Expo events were the first U.S.andO;showing of the high-quality Purup drum recorder, Kanji on the Linotype RIP 30and Agfa Max Plus, Birmy's announcement that it will use a faster MIPS chipin its Emerald product, Monotype's interesting deals for Adobe RIPs withBerthold and A.B.andP;  Dick/Itek Graphix, and a software product from Ultimatethat should help everyone in the PostScript output business.andP;  Alphatype alsohad important output news, which is covered along with its other products inthe Systems section.andM;At the two events, there also were demonstrations by Tegra Varityper andOptronics that showed the same output systems we had seen before--the Series4000 and 5000 lines from Tegra Varityper and the ColorSetter 2000 fromOptronics.andP;  Our previous impressions won't be repeated here.andM;Speed tests.andP;  We have been awaiting eagerly the opportunity to conduct ourown speed tests of the new Emerald machines, plus some other new devices onthe market.andP;  It appears that the time has nearly arrived, so we are hoping tohave some results in about a month.andP;  Our new tests will be expanded toinclude some newspaper pages and a large color image.andM;Agfa supports Kanji on Max PlusandM;Agfa Compugraphic demostrated support for Kanji on its Series 9000 PS MaxPlus RIP, called the Max Lpus/J.andP;  It comes with two Kanji fonts, Kanjisoftware, 35 Latin fonts and a 200-MB hard disk.andP;  Like the standard Max Plus,the J version uses a 50-MHz 68030 processor and 68882 math coprocessor, 64Kof high-speed cache memory and an Ethernet option.andP;  It can be configured withthe ProSet 9800 and SelectSet 5000 imaging devices.andM;The Max Plus/J will be available soon in the U.S.andP;  for $36,000.andM;Faster Genics.andP;  Agfa also announced that it has begun shipping a higher-speedversion of its Genics RIP, which runs the Compugraphic command language aswell as other page description languages.andP;  Agfa said it runs at up to doublethe speed of the previous Genics RIP.andM;Autologic ships 15 EmeraldsandM;Autologic reported that it had shipped more that 175 PostScript imagesetters,of which at least 15 were Emeralds--giving it the fastest start among thesuppliers of Emerald units.andP;  Customers buying Emeralds were the Birmingham(AL) News, the Ft.andP;  Lauderdale (FL) News and Sun Sentinel, the New York Times(which bought four), the Ottawa (ON) Citizen, the Palm Beach (FL) Post,Penton Publishing (Cleveland), San Francisco Newspapers, Syracuse Newspapers(Syracuse, NY) and the Los Angeles Times (four units).andM;Autologic, which calls its Emerald system the PS PIP II, unveiled newpackaging that supports additional options, such as an Ethernet interface andan output multiplexer that enables up to four PIPs to access up to eightimaging engines.andP;  Autologic also announced that it now offers BitstreamPostScript fonts besides Autologic and Adobe ones.andM;The PS PIP II sells for $29,500, including 8 MB of cache memory and a 70-MBdisk for storing fonts, system software and working files.andP;  It uses the MIPSR3000 processor with an R3010 floating-point coprocessor.andP;  The standardsystem includes a 386SX computer acting as an APS-6 interface, with 16 MB ofimage memory and a 70-MB system disk.andP;  Optional memory costs $4,500 to get atotal of 32 MB, $9,000 for a total of 48 MB, $13,500 for a total of 64 MB,and $18,000 for a total of 80 MB.andP;  As with other Autologic output devices,the PIP builds an entire page before it starts to record, which avoidsstopping and starting the engine and enables overlapping processing of asecond job while the first one is being imaged.andM;The Atlas-based PIP I continues to be offered for $25,500.andM;Birmy to get more MIPS from MIPSandM;Birmy Graphics, which already had announced plans to add an Adobe Emerald RIPto its stable of products, used the Seybold Conference to reveal that itsEmerald will employ a new, faster version of the MIPS R3000 chip, called the3000-A.andP;  According to the company's vice president, Ted Brimingham, Birmywill be the first vendor to incorporate the 21-MIPS version (25-MHz clockrate) of the chip in an Emerald RIP, which is why Birmy will call it theEmerald Plus.andP;  Other vendors have used the original 16-MIPS version.andM;Using the faster chip has meant completely redesigning the board, Birmy said.andO;The main difference relates to memory configurations.andP;  With Birmy's design,the Plus can accommodate up to 120 MB of memory, using new SIMM modules ofBirmy's design.andM;The large memory capacity enables use of an all-RAM buffer on the EmeraldPlus as an alternative to Birmy's buffer card, which uses an Intel 80960processor chip and a disk subsystem for storage.andP;  In either case, bufferingentire pages of data avoids having to stop and start the recording engine asthe page is output.andP;  It also enables the RIP to begin processing the next jobwhen recording of the previous one begins.andM;Birmy's Emerald Plus will be able to drive multiple recorders, including upto three plain-paper machines and five high-resolution imagesetters.andO;Recorders to be available will include ECRM PelBoxes, Ultre UltreSetters,Graphic Enterprises PageScans and Canon printers.andM;In addition to being faster, Birmy said, the Plus is smaller and runs coolerthan the standard Emerald.andM;The Emerald Plus will cost $19,500, including 8 MB of RAM, two RISCprocessors, a full-page buffering capability, two 80-MB disks, three inputinterfaces (LocalTalk, parallel and RS232 serial) and 35 Adobe typefaces.andP;  Anadditional 8-MB SIMM will cost $1,200; a 16-MB one will be $2,400.andM;An 11&quot; x 17&quot; plain-paper recorder offering a resolution of about 600 x 600dpi will cost $14,000.andP;  Configuring a 72-pica Ultre recorder with a 600-dpiplain-paper machine and an Emerald Plus will cost about $51,500, plus $1,200for an extra 8 MB of memory and $1,500 for the Q-Station (see below).andO;Alternatively, a PelBox 3000 could be substituted for the Ultre unit for$40,000, or a Holotek 350Z could be included for $48,000.andM;Birmy said it also will offer a standalone system based on the Emerald Plusthat will be priced to compete with the Varityper VT600W, the Xitron Clipperand other devices currently on the market, most of which are priced somewhatabove $20,000.andM;Beta testing of the Emerald Plus will start in November, with initialshipments expected in December.andP;  The first newspaper scheduled to receive anEmerald Plus is the Arkansas Democrat, the flagship paper of the HussmanGroup.andP;  The first color separation service customer will be CapitalEngraving, of Nashville, TN, which does a lot of four-color work.andM;Birny has been using PostScript clone RIPS from Raster Image ProcessingSystems, which will continue to be offered after the Emerald Plus isavailable.andP;  The Emerald Plus will be the only Adobe RIP offered by Birmy.andM;Other new features.andP;  Birmy demonstrated enhancements to its Q-Station, whichcontrols its output systems.andP;  The main new items are support for EtherTalkand a Q-Curve facility for modifying the control points for gray-scaleimages.andP;  After gray curves are modified, they can be stored and reused laterfor different setups, such as varying resolutions.andP;  Birmy said it will add ameans of attaching a densitometer in such a way that an untrained operatorcan use it in improving output of images.andM;These new features will be offered with either the Adobe or the RIPSprocessor.andP;  A LocalTalk or EtherTalk card with Q-Station software, includingQ-Curve functions, will cost $1,500.andM;ECRM makes Autokon more versatileandM;Although ECRM showed no brand-new products, it introduced an important&quot;configuration capability&quot; that will have significant bearing on the wayhigh-end scanners and recorders are purchased from ECRM in the future.andM;ECRM's Autokon camera is basically a scanner coupled to a recorder.andP;  Untilnow, not only were the two units delivered in one cabinet, but they weretightly coupled electronically and worked in sync to scan, scale, screen andrecord at user-selected screen rulings and resolutions.andP;  Now the customerwill have a new option to decouple the scanning and recording engines to addconsiderable flexibility to the operation.andM;A couple of years ago, ECRM connected its scanner to a SCSI disk buffer andcontrolled it from a Macintosh.andP;  This setup allowed customers to takehigh-resolution files from the scanner, in TIFF format, into desktop deviceswithout the special, high-speed interface cards that were formerly required.andO;More recently, ECRM has allowed images stored on these SCSI buffer disks tobe output to any EECRM recorder.andP;  In effect, this decouples the scanning fromthe recorder, allowing one operation to occur independently from the other.andO;No longer do the two devices have to work in sync.andP;  Scanning and recordingcan be completely independent operations.andM;With this complete decoupling of scanner and recorder, it is possible toconfigure a number of cameras (to be used in the conventional Autokonfashion) by attaching any scanning device to any recording device, with aSCSI buffer in the middle.andP;  If the combination is used as an Autokon camera,images are scanned into the buffer and later recorded, with only a slighttime penalty over the conventional camera operation.andP;  In addition to usingthe camera in this fashion, the operator now has two independent devices athis disposal--a full-function, high-resolution scanner (which could beattached to any other system) and a high-resolution recorder that could beused to record scanned images, pages rasterized outside of the ECRM system,or photos from wire services.andM;Better yet, the user has a choice of exactly which recorder to use(resolution, width and speed) and which scanner meets the needs--any scannercan be mixed or matched with any recorder.andM;One fact that shouldn't get lost in all of this is that the Mac is taking onmore and more of the control of the scanner and recording tasks.andM;Harlequin shows broad arrayandM;Harlequin took a leaf from Hyphen's book and demosntrated a wide range of RIPapplications running a software on different platforms.andP;  These includedsoftware RIPs on the Macintosh outputting to the Ultre imaging unit (theEuropean version of the Hell Xenotron BridgIt imagesetter) and the ECRMPelBox engines.andP;  Also on the stand was a Sun-4/330 unit driving a20-page-per-minute, 300-dpi printer from Panasonic.andP;  there was also aSolbourne twin-processor, Sparcbased unit to demostrate system functions, butit was only outputting simultaneously to two screens.andM;We understand that Harlequin has signed some new OEM agreements, but thatthey haven't been announced yet.andP;  (We will cover at least one of these in ourreport from IFRA.)andP;  Already public are agreementss with Purup Electronics,Hell Xenotron, ND Comtec (which uses it as an output server driver), and anEnglish company called DFI, which drives laser printers.andM;Hyphen turns to DashandM;Hyphen has extended itself.andP;  It has moved downward, into the 600-dpi outputrange, by introducing its Dash 600 plain-paper PostScript printer, based on aHyphen RIP and a Copal engine.andP;  In addition to putting Hyphen into theburgeoning market for 600-dpi printers, the new offering enables Hyphencustomers to configure a quality plain-paper engine with a high-resolution,photographic device that can be driven by the same RIP.andM;We've covered the Copal engine many times in the past, as it has been adoptedby Chelgraph and Linotype for their PPT-600 and LaserPrinter 60 devices,respectively, so we won't report all of its specifications here.andP;  But we willnote that it prints on A4- (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) or A3- (11&quot; x 17&quot;) sized sheets at arate of 12 A4-sized pages per minute.andM;Hyphen said it had sold 50 Dash 600s in the two weeks after announcing it.andO;Shipments were scheduled to begin soon after the Seybold Conference.andM;The software RIP to drive the engine costs $18,000, to which must be addedthe price of a Macintosh II, which puts the total cost in the same range ascompetitive machines.andP;  The Hyphen system has the obvious advantage of beingbased on a standard platform, which can be used for other purposes and whichcan be upgraded to a faster model whenever Apple releases one.andM;Customers who already have Hyphen RIPs running in Macintoshes, such as thosedriving Ultre or PelBox recorders, can use the same Macintosh to drive theDash 600.andP;  Those customers can purchase the Copal engine alone for $15,000and use a software switch to select the desired output device for each job.andM;Hyphen said it will offer the Dash 600 with a PC RIP in the first quarter of1991.andM;Hyphen also demonstrated its MacRIP driving a Linotronic 500, with theability to switch between a Dash printer for plain-paper output and thehigh-resolution L500 if the Mac is properly configured.andP;  To add a RIP for oneof the Linotronic recorders costs $14,950.andP;  Customers purchasing a Dash 600and a MacRIP for the Linotronic will pay $30,000 for the package, notincluding the Macintosh and, of course, not including the Linotronic.andM;A PC version of the Linotronic RIP also is available for $14,950.andP;  Like theMacRip, it drives L300 and L500 recorders.andM;Speed through OPI.andP;  At the IFRA show in Barcelona on Oct. 15, Hyphen said itwould introduce a new means of increasing the speed at which it outputsgraphics.andP;  The key is to use the Open Prepress Interface (OPI) to avoidhaving to transmit graphics over the network.andP;  OPI supports sending croppingand sizing instructions for graphics to be output, but the graphicsthemselves aren't transmitted.andP;  The system finds the graphics on a serverdisk and applies the new instructions to them.andM;This procedure, which works with any application that supports OPI, resultsin huge savings in time for many jobs.andP;  Hyphen reported that one job thattook nine minutes to send to a recorder without using OPI took 30 secondswith the new procedure.andM;Hyphen planned to demonstrate this function at IFRA using a Sparcstation RIP.andM;Other configurations.andP;  At the Seybold Conference, Hyphen was focusing on thefact that it can fit its RIPs into nearly any customer's environment, havingenabled its software to run on 14 different platforms so far.andP;  One of thosecomes from Digital Equipment, which is the configuration in use at the KansasCity Star.andP;  There, the Hyphen software RIP is driving an Ultre recorder via aSCSI interface.andM;Among the next recorders we may see driven by Hyphen RIPs are the Agfa ones,which Hyphen has been working on as an inhouse project (not through Agfa).andO;Already on the list are those from Bidco, Copal, Crosfield, Dainippon Screen,ECRM, Hell, Holotek, Iris, Linotype, Monotype, Purup, Scitex and Ultre.andM;Screaming Color.andP;  Hyphen also announced an arrangement with Screaming Color,a new competitor in the market for links between desktop products andhigh-end color systems.andP;  Screaming Color is using the Hyphen RIP in itsproduct, called RipLink, which we describe in our section on colordevelopments.andP;  Both companies have rights to sell RipLink.andM;Linotype shows Kanji RIPandM;Linotype demonstrated a Kanji version of its Adobe PostScript RIP 3 andannounced a Kanji version of the Neptune-technology RIP 30.andP;  Based on a33-MHz 68030 processor with 16 MB of memory, the RIP 30-J includes a 160-MBhard disk and a 3 1/2&quot; floppy drive.andP;  It supports the Linotype Image RasterAccelerator (LIRA) for faster processing of halftones.andM;Included with the RIP 30-J are two Kanji fonts (Ryumin Light and Gothic BBBMedium), which correspond to the LaserWriter IINTX-J Kanji fonts, and thestandard.andP;  35 Laser-Writer Latin faces (13 in ROMs).andP;  The RIP 30-J wasdesigned with an external SCSI port for fast downloading of Kanji fonts.andM;Standard interfaces are LocalTalk, RS232 serial, Centronics parallel andEthernet.andM;The RIP 30-J that was demonstrated at the Seybold event was the first KanjiRIP Linotype had installed in the U.S.andP;  It is in use at TechArt, Inc., of SanFrancisco, a graphic design and typesetting shop.andM;Linotype also demonstrated other items from its non-Latin product line (Thai,Arabic, Indian and Hebrew), most of which had been shown at Drupa and werereviewed in our coverage of that show.andM;Regarding its output devices in general, Linotype said that it experieced 15%growth in the first half of this year and that it is on its business plan forthe year.andP;  August was the best month in the company's history in theimagesetter market, according to Dave Dinin, the president of the U.S.andO;company.andM;F3 fonts.andP;  Linotype announced the availability of 70 new typeface packages inF3 format for use on Sun workstations in the OpenWindows environment,providing a total of more than 300 F3 fonts in the library.andP;  They can be usedwith the new Sun NewsPrint software and SparcPrinter.andM;LinoCare.andP;  Linotype advertised its new LinoCare support program, whichenables remote diagnostics to aid in solving customers' problems.andP;  Theprogram uses Farallon's Timbuktu software to link a customer's Macintosh withthe Linotype Technical Assistance Center in Hauppauge, Hew York.andP;  Some of thefunctions that can be performed are checking font setups, diagnosing problemswith Linotype PostScript RIPs or networks, and running test jobs.andM;Monotype in new deal with AdobeandM;Monotype planned to launch a range of new products at the IFRA show inBarcelona, which will be the focus of our next issue.andP;  But it did report anextension to its Adobe agreement that allows Monotype to become an OEMsupplier of Adobe RIPs that it manufactures.andP;  Its first customer is H.andO;Berthold, which we understand will take Monotype's Emerald RIP for use withinits systems.andM;Monotype also has reached an agreement with A.B.andP;  Dick and its Itek Graphixunit (which currently handles cameras, platemakers and imaging supplies)under which Itek's UK subsidiary will sell Monotype's Prism imagesetter asthe Itek Pro-Image 80.andP;  Wd do not know yet whether this agreement extendsoutside of the UK.andP;  But it shows that in spite of the fact that Itek hasclosed its own composition division operation (including its 7000 PStypesetter), it is still planning to sell typesetting products.andM;A further note on Monotype is that we are starting to see changes resultingfrom KBA's ownership.andP;  We are planning to deal with this topic in ourforthcoming Seybold European Publishing Conference when Richard Black,chairman of both KBA and Monotype, will talk on the changing role ofsuppliers in this industry.andM;Purup's ImageMaker in U.S.andP;  debutandM;At both Graph Expo and the Seybold Exposition, Purup showed the PostScriptimagesetter that was unveiled at Drupa for the world market (see Vol.andP;  19,No.andP;  19, p. 69).andP;  Called the ImageMaker, it consists of three parts: theStandard Page Tools software that runs in a Macintosh, the PS Link RIP, andthe imaging engine itself.andP;  The PostScript interpreter is supplied byHarlequin.andM;Purup is scheduled to disclose more details about the machine and itsmarketing plans at a press conference on Nov. 8.andP;  We'll report more from thatoccasion.andP;  One interesting note that has been revealed is that ImageMakerwill be available either with the standard PostScript screening techniquesfrom Adobe or as an option with Hell's R/T screening method, which Purup haslicensed from Hell.andM;Scangraphic unveils desktop unitandM;Although it almost didn't reach the exhibit floor because of shipping andcustoms problems, Scangraphic's new desktop imagesetter lived up to itsbilling as one of the highlights of the show.andP;  In its first publicappearance, it was demonstrated only in prototype form, so formal evaluationswill have to wait until later.andM;The ColorStar 328 is a desktop internal drum imagesetter with an image sizecomparable to that of the existing Scangraphic Scantext 2030 PD unit--12.9&quot; x24&quot;.andP;  The new device differs from other Scangraphic devices in that it is offixed resolution--1,626 dpi--whereas other Scangraphic devices have ahigh-resolution mode of 3,252 dpi and a low resolution of 813 dpi.andM;The ColorStar is built with an Adobe Emerald RIP (which Scangraphic calls theConcorde) with 16 MB of RAM and a 3 1/2&quot; hard disk.andP;  The capacity of theproduct that will be delivered hasn't been confirmed, but we expect it to beabout 100 MB.andP;  The system comes with a range of interfaces; the prototype hadevery interface that Scangraphic supports on its larger models, includingTransputer-based interfaces to its other systems.andP;  At this stage, it is notclear which of these interfaces will be included within the system, but it islikely to include SCSI, RS232, LocalTalk and Ethernet.andP;  Pricing hasn't beenannounced yet because Scangraphic is still evaluating the manufacturing costsof the unit.andM;One fact that must be mentioned is that Scangraphic won't sell the ColorStarto end users.andP;  It was developed solely for the U.S.andP;  market and will be soldby Scangraphic to OEMs, VARs and distributors.andP;  The company's intentions atthe Seybold Conference were to meet potential resellers and to discusspotential distribution agreements with them.andM;From our discussions with Scangraphic, and from the activity we saw at thestand, there is no shortage of potential resellers.andP;  We know Scangraphic istalking to large companies that are capable of being major players in themarketplace if they get the product.andP;  We naturally look forward to seeingmore of the ColorStar when it gets closer to the market, and to finding outhow it will be sold.andM;Elsewhere, we can report that Scangraphic has begun shipping Emeraldsystems--the first company besides Autologic to do so, to our knowledge.andP;  TheRIP is being incorporated into the Scantext 2030 PD and 2051 PD imagesetters,and as an upgrade to existing systems.andM;Ultimate in the act with FilmSaverandM;Ultimate Technographics, known for its commercial-quality compositionsystems, continues to broaden its base with products for the generalPostScript output market.andP;  Earlier, it began selling Impostrip for impositionof PostScript files for platemaking.andP;  The latest addition to the lineup iscalled FilmSaver.andP;  As its name suggests, it is intended to make moreefficient use of film when files are sent to an imagesetter.andM;FilmSaver, which runs on both PCs and Macintoshes, accepts files from mostpopular desktop publishing programs and many professional systems.andP;  It caneither rotate pages 90 degrees or place pages side by side to use the minimumpossible amount of RC paper or film in the imagesetter.andP;  It doesn't imposepages in sequence for printing, but that function is available withImpostrip.andM;FilmSaver also lets the user scale pages and access negative andmirror-imaging commands on the imagesetter.andP;  It can remove or retain cropmarks, and, with programs that presume all pages are 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;, it detectsthe actual size of the page area and bases its calculations on that.andM;FilmSaver will be priced at $995 in the U.S., available in mid-November fromUltimate or through its dealer network.andP;  It supports most major outputdevices, including those from Linotype, Agfa, Autologic, Optronics andHyphen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
