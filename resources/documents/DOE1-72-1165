<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-1165 </DOCNO><TEXT>Laboratory experiments have shown that many common urban constructionalmaterials have a marked capacity for abstracting and retaining very smallamounts of caesium from aqueous solution and in the event of a severenuclear accident, special techniques may be called for to decontaminateurban areas. Investigations were conducted in an effort to discover anon-destructive means of removing radiocaesium from the surfaces of arange of typical urban constructional materials which might be contaminatedas a result of an accident at a nuclear power plant. The most usefulmeans of decontamination was found to be treatment with an aqueous solutioncontaining ammonium ion. Steam cleaning was generally ineffective althoughthere were some exceptions. Sand-blasting was always effective althoughof limited application. Contaminated samples for test purposes were preparedby application of caesium in both wet and dry forms.</TEXT></DOC>
