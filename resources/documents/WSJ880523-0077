The sanctions Congress adopted in 1986 over President Reagan's veto have hurt South Africa. The U.S. ban on new investment and loans, along with other penalties, has pinched South Africa's economic growth by about a percentage point. But the penalties haven't yet achieved their goal of hastening the end of apartheid, repealing the state of emergency or encouraging negotiations with black groups. In fact, the sanctions may have helped provoke Pretoria to increase repression of anti-apartheid groups.    Some believe the U.S. should give the current sanctions more time before rushing ahead with tougher measures. &quot;I think we have to wait a little while longer to let the message sink in and then see whether the political attitudes change,&quot; says David Hauck, of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit research organization that examines social policy issues for institutional investors.    He says the U.S. should try to plug leaks in the sanctions by seeking international cooperation before it imposes more penalties.    But Congress, impatient with South African recalcitrance, may be swept up in election-year fever that will make Boer-bashing irresistible. &quot;It's an emotional issue. The racial implications are ever present. Anybody who argues against sanctions is relegated to the ranks of being proapartheid,&quot; says Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs committee, who opposes sanctions.    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, counters: &quot;The purpose of sanctions is to add to the cost the regime must bear for its repression. It's the failure to advance that pressure that reinforces the Afrikaaners' fantasy that they can maintain the system without fundamental cost, and that is a disincentive to negotiate.&quot;    Last month, the House Foreign Affairs committee approved a harsh measure that would require U.S. companies to terminate nearly all investment in South Africa and end all trade within a year. The House is expected to vote on the bill within a few weeks, and the bill's sponsors predict passage.    The Senate won't act before the House approves a bill; it currently has other pressing issues, such as the superpower treaty to limit intermediate nuclear weapons, on its plate. But Senate staffers already are plotting a strategy designed to attract a combination of Democrats and moderate Republicans by strengthening the existing sanctions without cutting all trade. The measures under discussions include barring U.S. vessels from transporting energy products to South Africa, expanding the prohibition on new loans to include short-term trade credits and closing South African consulates.    The administration is expected to veto further sanctions, which it says only increase economic hardships for blacks and reduce the government's willingness to negotiate. In recent months , it notes, Pretoria has restricted the activities of 17 anti-apartheid groups and proposed legislation prohibiting any organization from receiving funds from abroad for &quot;political&quot; activities.    The administration also contends that the U.S. must maintain a presence in South Africa to influence events. &quot;Apartheid will not go away just because we do,&quot; Charles Freeman, a State Department official, told Congress recently.    South Africa's economy grew about 2.5% last year, perhaps a percentage point less than it might have in the absence of sanctions, State Department analysts estimate. But without international cooperation, South Africa evades part of the bite of sanctions. It found new markets in Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong for citrus products that it once sold here, for instance, and total agricultural exports actually rose 2.5% from 1986. Overall, Japan replaced the U.S. last year as the No. 1 market for South African exports, according to a recent U.S. General Accounting Office report.    Sanctions may prove more potent as a threat than a reality. And, warns Mr. Hauck of Investor Responsibility Research Center, ineffective sanctions only send the message to South Africa that U.S. &quot;opprobrium isn't that tough to get around.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
