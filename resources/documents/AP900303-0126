Having decimated organized labor, boosted share ownership anddenationalized vast chunks of state-owned industry, the primetarget in Mrs. Thatcher's third term was to be the socialistbastions of local government.   But the tax reform Mrs. Thatcher devised for the war on thelocal front _ combined with inflation of 8 percent and recordinterest rates of 15 percent _ has helped foment a rebellion.   A Gallup poll published Friday put the Conservatives 18.5 pointsbehind the opposition Labor Party, their worst showing in nearly 20years.   On Saturday, thousands of protesters _ many self-described Toryvoters _ marched noisily in demonstrations around the country.   The peaceful demonstrations _ in Plymouth, Taunton, Bristol andManchester _ included families pushing strollers and seniorcitizens carrying ``No Poll Tax'' placards.   Mrs. Thatcher's idea seemed simple initially: Instead of havinghomeowners pay varying amounts of taxes on their property, havelocal councils estimate their annual expenses, then divide thecosts equally among all adults in the district.   Since most local councils are run by socialists, and sincesocialists are big spenders, the voters will quickly discover thecost of electing socialists, Mrs. Thatcher reasoned. The new tax,formally known as a community charge, thus became known as the polltax.   The government figured that under the new system, which tookeffect this year, each adult would pay about $472. Instead, asamounts are announced, the average is shaping up to be $630, andsurveys show most households will pay one-third more than under theprevious system.   Mrs. Thatcher insists that this is due to socialist profligacy,and she accuses councils of exploiting the tax reform to rake incash. But high charges have also been levied in Conservative-rundistricts.   A survey in The Times of London on Friday showed that communitycharges in only 3 of 69 local councils were close to the $472estimate. Most showed increases of 30 percent to 50 percent overlast year.   On Wednesday, 18 of the 25 Conservatives who controlled the WestOxford District Council resigned to protest having to charge $700this year, instead of a planned $430.   The disillusioned Tories blamed reductions in central governmentgrants and higher wage and welfare bills.   Reductions of up to 80 percent of community charges areavailable to students, the unemployed, low-income pensioners andothers.   But at the same time, the reform means that a single person inan eight-bedroom apartment will pay less than a couple living nextdoor in three rooms, since each taxable adult must pay the sameamount.   The Duke of Westminster, the richest man in Britain, previouslypaid $17,415 property tax on his estate. His community charge is$709, the same as his resident chauffeur and housekeeper must pay.   ``I won't pay,'' said Sheila Jackson, a Conservative voter whosehusband earns $240 a week as a plasterer in the south Englandcoastal town of Weymouth.   ``We want to pay to our way, we've worked to improve ourselves... but now this government just makes it impossible,'' she said ina telephone interview. ``Perhaps this is a case of her (Mrs.Thatcher) being in power too long. I'm ashamed I voted Tory.''   The Jacksons paid $555 last year in property taxes, but thisyear they face a community charge of $1,140.   Mrs. Thatcher is being blamed by worried rank-and-fileConservative lawmakers, gleeful Laborites and swaths of voters inthe Tory heartlands of southern England.   The media routinely refer to the community charge as ``the issuethat could cost the Tories the next election.''   ``We will have to think again,'' said lawmaker Sir Marcus Fox,deputy chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of rank-and-fileTory members of Parliament. ``From the prime minister downward, Ithink we all now know we have a major problem.''   The next election is not due until 1991 or 1992, and Mrs.Thatcher has time to quiet the controversy by pouring in governmentmoney to cushion the hardest hit districts.   So far she has adamantly insisted that the community charge is afairer system and will not be changed.</TEXT></DOC>
