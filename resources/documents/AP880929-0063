Henry Burt, 35, faces hanging unless President P.W. Bothacommutes the sentence. No execution date was announced.   Burt was convicted last year of beating Sgt. Johannes Ndimandeinto unconsciousness in June 1986, placing a gasoline-soaked tirearound his neck, and setting it on fire. No clear motive wasestablished in the trial.   That method of killing is called ``necklacing.'' The governmentsays scores of blacks were ``necklaced'' from 1984 through 1987 byblack radicals who suspected them of collaborating with whiteauthorities.   Burt, a former soldier who worked for the state-run NuclearDevelopment Corp., pleaded innocent at his trial, though he said hegave the policeman a lift that night.   Part of Burt's defense was that he attended a meeting before thekilling at which white residents complained about rising blackcrime. But the Appeal Court rejected that defense in today's ruling.</TEXT></DOC>
