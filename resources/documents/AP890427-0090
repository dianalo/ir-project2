French envoy Pierre Morel, who chaired the talks, said resultsat the latest 15-week session ``may appear as falling short of theambitions'' set by the 149-nation conference on chemical weapons inJanuary.   That Paris meeting called on negotiators to redouble efforts tofinish their work, which dates back to 1968.   Morel suggested in a written progress report that ``real andintensive negotiations'' have yet to begin at the chemical armstalks in the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. He said ``actualprogress'' would be sought when the conference reconvenes in June.   Morel said more than 18 countries have carried out trialinspections of their national chemical industries, a move aimed athelping negotiators design ways to police a future ban.   But disagreement persisted, as in past years, on precisely theseprovisions for monitoring compliance and on several other issues,East German delegate Peter Dietze told the closing meeting of theconference's spring session.   The Soviet Union and three Soviet bloc countries have submittedreports on national inspections to the conference, while the UnitedStates and Britain are among those expected to report at the nextsession, Morel said.   Morel's report showed that one problem facing negotiators isthat poison gas can easily be produced with readily availablechemicals in plants not specially designed for the purpose. SomeWestern experts have said total monitoring of a chemical weaponstreaty is not feasible.   Negotiators are seeking to complete a global convention banningthe production, use and stockpiling of chemical arms. The talks arethe priority agenda item at the disarmament conference, the world'sonly multilateral arms negotiating forum.</TEXT></DOC>
