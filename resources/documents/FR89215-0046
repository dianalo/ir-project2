Therule implements a reorganization of some sections of the current regulations,changes some current policies, and edits current language. Areas in whichmajor policy changes are found include: current regulatory requirementsfor replacement of benefits, issuance reconciliation requirements, liabilitiesrelated to direct mail issuance of benefits and liabilities related tothe use of authorization-to-participate (ATP) cards. This rule also implementsprovisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198) regardingstaggered issuance of benefits, photographic identification, and alternativeissuance systems for State agencies. The effect of these changes will beto make specific provisions easier to locate, agency policies and statutoryprovisions more clearly stated, issuance liabilities more fully outlinedand the regulatory language, in general, easier to understand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule becomes effective April 1, 1989.

Additionally, this action will not result in significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Therefore, this action has beenclassified as ``not major.'' Executive Order No. 12372 This Program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the Final rule related Notice(s)to 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V (cite 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983; or 48 FR 54317,December 1, 1983, as appropriate, and any subsequent notices that may apply),this Program/activity is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.Regulatory Flexibility Act. This action has also been reviewed in relation to the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, September19, 1980). Anna Kondratas, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service(FNS), has certified that this action will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule streamlinesand simplifies coupon issuance and State agency liability rules. No newrequirements are being placed on small businesses or organizations. Somenew requirements are being placed on State agencies. However, the requirementswill not have a significant economic impact on local governments.

The publication proposed a reorganization ofthe current rules, changes in some policies, a clarification of currentlanguage to make the rules easier to understand and proposed to implementsome provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Pub. L. 99-198). Thereader is referred to the April 9, 1986 publication for review and consultationin order to ensure a complete background and understanding of this document.All comments received on the proposed rule have been considered in theformulation of this final rule. 1. Definitions The Department proposed adding definitions for ``Authorization document''and ``Claims collection point.'' Those proposed definitions have been adoptedin this final rule without comment. One commenter suggested that the term``authorization to participate (ATP) card'' be removed from the definitionslist. Even though the Department is working to eliminate distinctions forseparate types of issuance systems, in favor of ``generic'' descriptionsand documents which would apply to many different issuance systems, thesuggestion has not been accepted. Since the term ``ATP'' is still usedthroughout the regulations, the definition must remain in andSection; 271.2.Another commenter proposed that the terms ``Master issuance file'', ``Record-for-issuance'',``Direct access system'' and ``Authorization document system'' be addedto the definitions list, since the terms were newly defined in the proposedrule, and are crucial to the description and understanding of current andyet-to-be-developed issuance systems. We think the  suggestion will makethe terms easier to locate and understand, and have, therefore, includedthe terms, with the exception of ``authorization document <T3>system</T3>'' in andSection; 271.2 The definition for ``authorizationdocument'' was included in the proposed rule and has not changed. One Stateagency suggested that a definition for household disaster be included.A disaster is a declared emergency for natural events such as tornadoesand floods, affecting a large number of households. An individual householdmay experience a misfortune such as a power outage or water damage froma storm, in which case benefits may be replaced under the replacement provisions.The above examples are merely guidelines, and since declared disastersand individual household misfortunes are treated separately, one definitionfor both would not be appropriate. The regulations which would be applicablein any particular situation would best be determined by the State agency.(andSection; 271.2) 2. Plan of Operation The proposed timetable required State agencies to submit their unit levelof reporting mail issuance losses by the 15th of August following publicationof this final rule and by that date in succeeding years if the unit levelof reporting is to change for their following fiscal year. Two State agenciescommented that the August 15 date was impractical because their fiscalyears started on July 1. However, the Department believes that the logicaltime for state agencies to submit changes would be with Budget ProjectionStatements, when costs and liabilities in other areas are being reviewed.Therefore, the Department has set May 15, 1989 as the deadline for an initialreport (if a State agency is changing its level of reporting), and subsequentchanges to be reported by August 15 in years thereafter. (andSection; 272.2(d)(1)(vi))3. State Monitoring of Duplicate Participation In reference to the Department's proposal for a reorganizational changeby moving the provisions requiring State agencies to check for duplicateparticipation from andSection; 274.1 to andSection; 272.4, two comments favoringthe move were received. The reorganizational change is adopted as final.(andSection; 272.4)4. Issuance Agents The proposal to exclude issuance agents from retail and wholesale foodfirms drew responses from 14 commenters. Four respondents agreed with theproposal, one was noncommittal, and nine were opposed, stating that therewould be great inconvenience to disabled and elderly recipients, that theprovision may eliminate Saturday issuance, that we have insufficient reasonfor discontinuing issuance in stores, and that recipients in some areaswould be disadvantaged because of a lack of public transportation to ``downtown''issuance offices. The Department has reviewed the situation and has decidedto retain the current policy, but with some modifications to control itsuse. Coupon issuance will be permitted in retail food firms by two exceptionsto the generally-proscriptive rule. First, coupons may be issued in a retailfood firm if the issuance functions are performed by a bank, credit union,or other financial institution unrelated to the food firm; second, a retailfood firm may issue coupons on its premises if the State agency presentsadequate documentation that without the availability of on-site store issuanceat a particular location there would be not merely an inconvenience, buta hardship, to recipients in obtaining coupons. In such a case, the Stateagency shall contract directly with the retail food firm and shall strictlysupervise such entity for security, reporting and accountability. Withoutthe hardship documentation, a retail food firm may perform the issuancefunctions itself, but only as a subcontractor to a bank, credit union orother financial institution, and with strict oversight by the financialinstitution. Retail food firms do not have to be authorized to accept andredeem food coupons from recipients in order to perform issuance. In additionbanks and credit unions do not have to be chartered under Federal or Statelaw. (andSection; 274.1(b)) 5. State Agency Issuance Responsibility In reference to the Department's proposal to require State agencies toreport changes of location or activity of food stamp offices, three commentersvoiced concern about what changes should be reported and the time framein which the reports should be made. Two commenters stated that whenevera mail issuance or replacement point, issuance point and bulk storage point,as well as a project area, reconciliation point or coupon shipment receivingpoint, is added, changed or terminated, the action should be reported.The comment is accepted. The third commenter voiced concern that State agencies were being requiredto report the change to FNS no later than 30 days prior to the effectivedate of the action, and thinks that State agencies ``should'' report theactions within that period. The Department feels that for efficient administrationof the Program in the many areas involved, it is mandatory that the Departmenthave at least a 30-day period in which to make necessary adjustments, suchas changing mailing lists, delivery routes and possible leasing of newspace. It will be incumbent on all State agencies which have local administrationof the Program to make sure the aforementioned actions are reported tothe State agencies on a timely basis. Therefore, the suggestion is notaccepted, and the proposed amendment is retained. (andSection; 274.1(d))6. Receipt of Benefits A provision from the Food Security Act of 1985 requires that, for householdsapplying for and receiving benefits in the last fifteen days of a month,benefits for the first full month of participation must be issued no laterthan the eighth day of the month following the month of application. (Thecurrent provision for expedited service requires benefits for the firstfull month to be issued by the first calendar day of the month after themonth of application.) Six comments were received concerning this provision;two commenters thought that ``the eighth day'' should be changed to ``thetenth day'' to be consistent with other Federal and State Programs. Twoother commenters expressed concern that if the State agency were allowedthe option of issuing (prorated) benefits to a household which appliedafter the 15th day, within the month in which the application was made,State agencies would not issue benefits in the month of application, butwould simply make one issuance by the eighth day of the following month.That issuance would be one full month and a partial allotment representinga period in the month of application. This is an option Congress made availableto the State agencies. Another commenter was concerned that an automatedissuance system could not handle a manual issuance in the second month(by the eighth day). The last commenter thought that a recipient may thinkhe is to get issuance twice a month if, for example, he receives a proratedallotment on the 29th and a full allotment on the 6th. Since the eighthday is mandated by legislation, it remains in this final rule. (andSection;274.2(b)) One commenter requested clarification of ``* * * the eighth calendar day* * *'' as it applies to Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. For householdsentitled to receive benefits for the first full month of participationby the eighth of the month after the month of application, the couponsor an ATP must be available to the households on that date. Regardlessof the system used to meet this delivery standard, the State agency shallprovide a reasonable opportunity for the negotiation of an ATP no laterthan the eighth calendar day. There are no exceptions to this requirementfor weekends or holidays. This rule does not include the issuance provisionfrom section 203 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-435),which will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. 7. Staggered Issuance Twenty-nine commenters addressed this provision from the Food SecurityAct of 1985, which permits the staggering of coupon issuance throughoutan entire month and limits the interval between regular or supplementalissuances to 40 days. Eighteen comments were supportive of the provisionas proposed. Six commenters expressed opposition to the 40-day maximumperiod between issuances, with all but one stating that the maximum shouldbe no more than 35 days. Another commenter thinks that the State agencies'use of supplemental issuances would be confusing to recipients, who mayassume they are to receive benefits twice a month. Three comments concernedthe fact that if the proposed option for State agencies to use a supplementalissuance for applicants certified after the 15th of the month were retained,the State agencies would avoid issuing any benefits in the month of application,and would instead make one issuance between the first and eighth of thefollowing month. Even though this is an option allowed by the legislation,it is hoped that State agencies will use it to get benefits to recipientson a timely basis, and not to unduly delay benefits. Six State agenciesvoiced concern about the impact of the change on current computer operations,especially since the systems cannot now handle a supplemental issuancemade manually in the second month. Several commenters thought that thoserecipients receiving ATPs after the 15th should have as much time to redeemthem as do those receiving ATPs prior to the 15th. A State agency opposedthe staggered issuance change because it did not correspond to the direct-mailschedule for households not reporting monthly. A commenter questioned whether or not the issuance of benefits under expeditedservice takes precedence over retrospective budgeting requirements. Ina one-month retrospective system, the issuance of benefits under expeditedservice takes precedence over the monthly reporting requirement; that is,the second month's issuance must be made on the first calendar day of themonth and not held pending receipt of the monthly report. The State agencymust make an eligibility and allotment determination based on the bestavailable information. Another comment concerned the fact that at least one State agency has a``cyclical'' issuance system based on the date of application, and thatthe ``eighth calendar day'' is not relevant to that system. In every issuancesystem there has to be an ``issuance month'', although it may not starton the first day of the calendar month; therefore, there has to be an eighthday (of the issuance month). Since the aforementioned changes are mandatedby legislation, they are retained in this final rule. (andSection; 273.2)All currently-approved waivers pertaining to increased or decreased staggeredissuance will automatically be cancelled April 1, 1989. Any State agencywhich wants to continue a current waiver after that date must reapply toFNS. 8. Providing Benefits to Recipients The Department proposed to move the provisions pertaining to delivery standardsfor issuing benefits to newly-certified households from Part 273 to Part274, because the provisions are not certification related but are standardsfor the actual issuance of benefits. One commenter stated concern aboutthe provision, since that part of the provision dealing with householdswhich have not provided complete verification is a certification concern,not an issuance concern. The Department believes that the provision hasmore applicability and importance for the distribution of benefits thanwith the certification of the households to receive benefits. These provisionsof the proposed rule are retained in the final rule. (andSection; 274.2)Another commenter objected to the Department's proposed revision whichstated that issuance authorization documents should be valid only in thegeographic area that is encompassed by the reconciliation system throughwhich the document will be processed. The commenter stated that the provisionwould present a hardship to recipients in rural areas. The Department hasreviewed the provision and has decided to encourage its use so as to keepthe reconciliation process from becoming needlessly complicated, but atthe same time make it a State agency option in order to eliminate hardshipfor recipients who may be located nearer issuance offices outside theircounty or project area. ATPs may not, however, be negotiated across Statelines. (andSection; 274.2(d)) 9. Issuance Systems The current regulations which define three types of issuance systems (ATP,HIR card, and mail) were developed in 1978 and, since that time, new systemshave been developed which do not fit the definitions of the three basicsystems. Also, the reporting and accountability requirements were basedon the unique features of these systems. Therefore, the Department proposedto establish new generic classifications for issuance systems so that newly-developedsystems can be accommodated by the rules. Six comments were received on the first new classification, authorizationdocument systems; three supported the classification as proposed and threewanted changes or clarifications. One commenter suggested that authorizationdocuments show a project area identifying code, plus the number of eachdenomination book of coupons to be issued. The Department has no objectionto either item being shown, but thinks they should be State agency optionsrather than regulatory requirements. A State agency commented that a descriptionof the ATP system should not be in the regulations since the system isfast becoming a minor or secondary system nationwide. As of January 1986,30 States used an ATP issuance system to some degree, with 10 States usingATPs for one hundred percent of issuance. Therefore, the Department doesnot consider it a minor issuance system at this time, although it may bereplaced in the future. The description of an ATP system is being retained,but is being included as an example of the more general authorization documentsystems. Another commenter suggested that rather than showing the ``expiration date''on an authorization document, the ``benefit month'' should be shown. TheDepartment believes that the ``expiration date'' would be more useful torecipients, since a date represents a definite end to the validity of thedocument. Such a date would also be less confusing for issuance cashiers.The same commenter stated that there should be four classifications ofissuance systems, adding the classification ``authorization issuance list.''The Department considers the ``authorization issuance list'' and the ``authorizationdocument'' systems to be the same since both require the signature of therecipient in order for the recipient to receive benefits. Three commentersthought it would be helpful if there were an explanation of exactly whatconstitutes an authorization document system. Such a system is one in whichthe recipient must sign a document (form, printout, register) in orderto receive the issuance. A direct access system (manual household issuancerecord (HIR) or access to master file directly or through a computer terminal)does not usually require a signature on a document. The last comment concernedwhether or not multiple files (physically separate) may constitute themaster issuance file; multiple files may be used as long as the files areclearly identified as part of the master issuance file and contain allthe required data. There were no separate comments on the second new classification, directaccess, or the third classification, mail issuance, as classifications<T3>per se. </T3>Comments regarding liability in mail issuance are reviewedlater in this section. Two commenters expressed concern that we were eliminating the permissibilityof one-person mail issuance functions. This provision was mistakenly omittedfrom the proposed rule. If these functions are performed by one person,a second-party review shall be made to verify coupon inventory, the reconciliationof the mail issuance log, and the number of mailings prepared. This provisionin the current rules has been retained in andSection; 274.3(d)(2) of thisfinal rule. A commenter wondered why the master issuance file must havedata on disqualified households. The data on disqualified households doesnot need to be retained on the master issuance file, and may be kept ina separate file, automated or manual. The data is required on the revisedForm <T3>FNS-366B, </T3>Program and Budget Summary Statement_Program ActivityStatement. 10. Alternative Issuance System for a State Agency The proposed rule, based upon section 1519 of the Food Security Act of1985 (Pub. L. 99-198), states that the Secretary, in consultation withthe Office of the Inspector General, shall require State agencies to changetheir systems of issuance if those systems are resulting in a loss of Programintegrity (significant dollar losses). Sixteen comments were received andall were against the legislative change. If a change in a State agency'sissuance system becomes necessary because of continuing issuance losses,the mandate to actually change the system will be made after discussionsinvolving the Department's Office of the Inspector General, FNS and theState agency. Such discussions will be concerned with the type(s) of lossesbeing experienced by the State agency, prior corrective action, local concernsand needs, resources available to the State agency, and the cost of a systemchange. Under this final rule, the cost of making such a change will beshared by the State agency and the Department. Several comments wanted guidelines or a definition for ``Program integrity'',and an explanation of how the loss of Program integrity would require asystem change. The loss of integrity could result from a large and continuingissuance loss. An exact percentage or dollar-amount threshhold which wouldtrigger the requirement to change systems cannot be made across the board.Each situation regarding a large and continuing loss would need to be evaluatedseparately, and as such, there is not an ``exact'' threshhold which couldbe applied to all cases.Other commenters expressed belief that in each case of a required change,the State agency should not be liable for losses from the new system, thatthere should be a definite time frame for when a new system has to be implementedand that there should be limits on conversion costs to protect State agencies'funds. The Department is unable to exempt a State agency from liabilitysince the law specifically states that State agencies will be held liablefor specific losses. A definite timetable for implementation of a new systemcannot be set in advance; again, each situation will have to be reviewedindependently. The Department does not want to set limits on conversioncosts, but is willing to share the costs. There were two comments centering on the belief that State agencies shouldhave appeal rights when confronted with an order to change issuance systems.The appeal process exists only for actions in which the Department hasbilled State agencies; there is no statutory provision allowing appealof an order to change an issuance system. However, an order to a Stateagency to change its issuance system may be negotiated if the State agencyis able to provide information showing that it's losses are decreasingor are not as great as first indicated. (andSection; 274.3(c)) 11. Validity Period for ATPs In this area, the Department proposed to amend the regulations to clarifythat a household would lose its right to a particular month's benefitsif the benefits were not obtained during the validity period of the benefitsfor that month. This is a clarification and not a change in policy. Second,the proposed rule expanded the current requirements on validity periodsto issuances made from Direct Access Systems, in that the protection affordedto recipients and State agencies using other systems would be applied toall recipients who do not have coupons delivered directly to them. Third,State agencies would be permitted to apply the 20-day addition or subsequent-monthprovision, at their option, to issuances made after the 20th day of theissuance month. Finally, if a State agency is experiencing excessive losses,it may institute a system which reduces or limits the validity period providedin this rule. Eleven comments were received concerning the validity period for issuances;all supported the proposed amendment. The proposed changes are made final.The current provision allowing State agencies to add an additional 20 daysto the validity period for authorization documents issued after the 20thday of the issuance month, as described in the proposed rule's preamble,was inadvertently omitted from the regulatory language, and has been insertedinto this final rule. (andSection; 274.3(d)(7)) 12. Reconciliation and Reporting The Department proposed several revisions to the current reconciliationand reporting requirements which would tighten those requirements and ensurethat they fit the proposed issuance system classification described above.The major change is the requirement that all issuance systems reconciletheir issuance activity against their master issuance files and reportthe results to FNS monthly. Only State agencies operating ATP systems hadbeen required to do this. This required report would be a revised versionof the Form <T3>FNS-46, </T3>Issuance Reconciliation Report, currently submitted monthlyfor authorization document systems. In mail issuance systems, a record-for-issuanceis created from the master issuance file; however, there is no accountingfor problems that may occur in the creation of the record-for-issuance.In direct access systems there is no required report on issuance activityother than the Form <T3>FNS-250, </T3>Food Coupon Accountability Report. While the nature ofsuch a system is that there is virtually no reason for additional reconciliation,there are other problems, such as replacements, for which accounting isnecessary. The new Form <T3>FNS-46 </T3>is being redesigned to be adaptable to the different typesof systems, and will have new items as well as some of the current ones.In addition to the above requirements, all systems would also continueto be required to reconcile inventory levels against issuances each monthon the Form <T3>FNS-250. </T3>The remaining reconciliation requirements are directlyrelated to the nature of the individual issuance systems. Direct accesssystems will have no other requirements, and the current requirement inandSection; 274.6(d) that for HIR card systems, State agencies do a semiannualcomparison of 20 percent of their case files against the master issuancefile, would be eliminated. In authorization document systems, State agencieswould need to take additional steps to reconcile the authorization documentsagainst the record-for-issuance, in order to check for problems in issuancethat occur in, or after, the generation of authorization documents fromthe record-for-issuance. The additional steps are the same as those requiredunder current rules; the additional data would be reported on the revisedForm <T3>FNS-46. </T3>In mail issuance systems, the steps required to reportmail loss data on the Form <T3>FNS-259 </T3>would still have to be taken. There were no proposed changesother than the new loss reporting levels and tolerance levels describedin andSection; 276.2, State Agency Liabilities. (andSection; 274.4(a)) Nineteen comments were received concerning the new reconciliation and reportingprovisions for issuance systems; eleven commenters were opposed. Severalof those opposed thought that a new ``layer'' of reconciliation was beingcreated to add a new liability for which State agencies could be billedfor errors. The primary purpose of the change was to emphasize the necessityfor those State agencies which already have a record-for-issuance fileto use the file in the reconciliation process; the proposal was not intendedto require State agencies which did not already have a record-for-issuancefile, to create one. In an authorization document system, the authorizationdocument is reconciled against the master issuance file. In those systemsin which there is no authorization document, but for which there is a record-for-issuance,the record-for-issuance file would be reconciled against the master issuancefile. Four commenters expressed the opinion that reconciliation of a record-for-issuancefile with the master issuance file is duplicative. To some extent thatis correct. However, since a record-for-issuance file contains only thosehouseholds which are to be issued benefits, rather than all householdswhich are (eligible) on the master issuance file, there is less data subjectedto possible errors because not all households receive benefits each monthand, therefore, would not be on the record-for-issuance file. To reconcileeach issuance with the master issuance file increases the chance of anunintentional altering of the data on individual household records dueto computer error. Another commenter wanted to know if batch reconciliationcould be done, since it was thought that the proposed regulation impliedthat each individual issuance document had to be reconciled against anindividual household record in the master issuance file. Regardless ofwhether or not a particular issuance system has a record-for-issuance file,batch reconciliation may still be used. Another commenter wanted a clarification of the term ``original allotment''as it pertains to replacements in andSection; 274.6(b)(1)(iv). In referenceto replacements, the term means the first benefits issued for a particularmonth to an on-going household, as opposed to ``initial allotment'' whichrefers to the first benefits issued a newly-certified household. The term``current month'', also used in andSection; 274.4(b)(1)(iv), refers to originalallotments which are recovered in the same month they are issued. The sarnecommenter asked what should be done with original allotments that are recoveredafter the current month of issuance. The allotments should be returnedto inventory and the replacement allotment reported on the Form <T3>FNS-46, </T3>unlike the situation in which an original allotment isissued, returned and replaced, all in the same month. The same commenteralso requested that the wording in andSection; 274.4(b)(4)(i) be modifiedto cover methods other than telephoning for transmitting the data for theForm <T3>FNS-388, </T3>State Coupon Issuance and Participation Estimates. Thecomment is accepted and the wording has been changed to indicate that thedata may be telephoned or electronically transmitted to FNS. (andSection;274.4(b)(4)(i)) One comment received suggested that the reconciliation requirements bemade more generic so that they could apply to any issuance system, andthat there should be a more detailed relationship between files and records.The Department believes that it has done this to the extent that the requirementshave not lost meaning by becoming too generic or general. As new issuancesystems are developed, it may become necessary to redefine terms or requirementsto make them applicable to all existing systems. However, the Departmentfeels that the requirements which will become applicable with this ruleare general enough for the foreseeable future. Concerning the relationshipbetween files and records, we believe that the distinction has been madesince State agencies are being urged to use a record-for-issuance, ratherthan a master issuance file for reconciliation. By so doing, there is lesschance for creating errors in individual household records, and there arefewer records involved in reconciliation.The Office of the Inspector General requested that the submission of theForm <T3>FNS-46, </T3>Issuance Reconciliation Report, by State agencies be limitedto the initial report each month, and that revised reports be permittedonly under unusual circumstances and with prior approval from FNS. TheDepartment feels that State agencies should be given the opportunity tocorrect posting and transcription errors which may have been made on initialreports. Allowing revised reports could result in more accurate reconciliationand, therefore, reduced liabilities for State agencies. A commenter stated that issuance systems using direct access should alsoreport on issuance activity, since such a system is subject to undetectedsoftware errors. Direct access systems will have to report on replacements.With an audit trail prepared within the computer itself, and the Form <T3>FNS-250, </T3>Food Coupon Accountability Report, accounting for discrepanciesin inventory, no additional reconciliation is needed. One of several suggestions by a commenter was that, in the reconciliationof issuance in authorization document systems, discrepancies should beresolved by reviewing case files, if necessary, as well as by a reviewconducted with the coupon issuer. Since all methods of resolving any discrepanciesshould be used, the suggestion is accepted and the wording ``* * * and/ora review of the case file'' is added to andSection; 274.4(a)(4)(ii). Thesame commenter asked that the regulations define ``participating household''.For the purpose of State agency reporting on the Form <T3>FNS-388. </T3>State Coupon Issuance and Participation Estimates, aparticipating household is one that is certified and has been, or willbe, issued benefits (whether or not the benefits are used), and on thathas met the eligibility requirements, but will receive zero benefits. Thedefinition will be added to andSection; 274.4(b)(4)(iv). Another question concerned how there could be a replacement in a DirectAccess System. There would be no replacements for unreceived benefits,but there may be a replacement for coupons which are improperly manufacturedor which are destroyed in a household disaster, or a replacement of an``access'' card in an electronic issuance system. Another commenter stated that a review of benefits indicated on the masterissuance file should not be included in quality control. As stated previously,the master issuance file must contain the amount issued. This amount maybe posted directly back to the master issuance file, as should be donein a direct access system, or indirectly, using a record-for-issuance file,as is usually done with mail issuance. If a record-for-issuance file isused, the actual issuance (posted to the record-for-issuance file) wouldthen be posted to, and compared with, the master issuance file. Only byhaving the actual issuance amounts posted to the master issuance file canissuance errors be detected. If the posting of actual issuance stoppedat the record-for-issuance, an issuance which was greater than that authorizedon the master issuance file may be detected only in inventory reconciliation.If a mistake had been made during the creation of the record-for-issuancefile from the master issuance file, and the record-for-issuance had beendiscarded, the only fact that would remain is that there was an overissuance;however, the overissuance could not be assigned to a specific household.If a record-for-issuance file is used, reconciliation must not stop withthat file, but must be carried back to the master issuance file. Qualitycontrol reviews would then be concerned with the matching of benefits authorizedto benefits issued, through a review of the record-for-issuance (as definedby this rule). With the use of a record-for-issuance, errors resultingin incorrect issuance could be correctly assigned to certification or issuanceactivity.The same commenter suggested that, for HIR systems, the issued amountsshown on the cashiers' daily reports and receptionists' daily tally sheetsmust be reconciled against the household issuance records. The Departmentbelieves that this is a logical and needed part of the reconciliation process,especially since HIR systems do not have master issuance or record-for-issuancefiles, per se. The commenter also expressed the opinion that all typesof issuances should be identified in the accountability system. Since allissuances, including manual issuances involving prorated and restored benefits,are to be posted to the master issuance files, these issuances will beincluded in reconciliation and accountability. Wording has been added tothe regulatory text to indicate this fact more clearly. (andSection; 274.4(a)(1))13. Authorized Representatives As part of the effort to organize the rules so that all the rules pertainingto the issuance of coupons are grouped together, the Department proposedto move some of the provisions related to authorized representatives toPart 274. The provisions moved are those relating to the use of authorizedrepresentatives to obtain benefits on behalf of recipients, as well asthose relating to the use of benefits to purchase food for Program recipients.By moving these provisions, currently found in andSection; 273.1(f), a certaindegree of redundancy is introduced into the regulations, since some provisions,such as those pertaining to the participation of disqualified individualsas authorized representatives, are found in both andSection;andSection; 273.1and 274.2. However, the Department believes that the advantage of havingall rules regarding issuance grouped together outweighs the disadvantageof repetition. In order to reduce the overall volume of rules so that therules would be more concise and easier to use, the Department proposedto eliminate the redundant provisions. Further, the provisions currentlyin the section that are not redundant have been moved to other places inthe body of rules. No comments were received on this reorganizational change.Therefore, the proposal is adopted without change. (andSection; 274.5) 14. When a Replacement Issuance will be Provided In the area of replacement issuances, the Department proposed to consolidatethe rules pertaining to replacements and to simplify the provisions foreasier understanding and application. Concerning policy changes, the Departmentproposed to establish a two-in-six months replacement policy for all categories(benefits destroyed, stolen or not received) of allowable replacements.State agencies would no longer have to track separate limits for differenttypes of losses. In addition, it was proposed to use the concept of ``countablereplacement'', meaning that a replacement would be applied toward the limitonly if there existed a possibility of Program loss. Twenty-one comments were received on this provision of the replacementrules. Ten approved of the provision as proposed, while five commentersexpressed concern about the tracking required to distinguish ``countable''from ``noncountable'' replacements. Under current rules, State agenciesare keeping track of two limits for three categories of replacements; nowthere is one limit for two categories, with confirmed disasters havingno limit. The Department thinks that the addition of a code to denote a``non-countable'' replacement could be made in any system, and that theburden of making the change does not outweigh the advantage which the codewould provide, especially considering the fact that all replacements shouldbe considered ``countable'' unless proven and noted otherwise. Five commenters thought that our proposal not to count replacements whichresulted from State agencies' errors was not justified and/or warranteda definition of State agency error. State agency error, in this context,refers to incorrect data in the case file which affects the issuance and/orreceipt of benefits (as opposed to eligibility and certification) by thathousehold. An example may be a situation in which a recipient's addressis incorrect, or in which a replacement issuance is made even though informationin the case file indicates it should not have been. It is believed thatany late or non-receipt of benefits which may have been caused by an inadvertentState agency error, should not result in a liability for the recipient.Therefore, the proposal is adopted without change. (andSection; 274.6(b)(2)(iv))Another commenter thinks that the proposed rule presumes that if benefitsare received by a particular household, it is that household that usesthe benefits. The commenter suggests that the wording be changed to statethat in order for a replacement to be countable, there must not only bethe probability of a Program loss, but also an additional gain for theparticular household. It is true that the Department does make the underlyingassumption that the household which receives benefits uses those benefits.A State agency would be unable to prove whether or not any particular household,or someone else, redeemed certain coupons, unless food firms which acceptcoupons were required to match the identity of coupons presented to documentswhich noted the specific identity of the coupons issued to any particularhousehold. Such a requirement is not feasible and would be impossible tomonitor. Therefore, only the probability of Program loss is being retainedas the reason for making a replacement countable, and the proposal is adoptedwithout change. (andSection; 274.6(a)) Two comments received concerned the fact that State agencies should beable to deny replacements when certified, as well as registered, issuanceis signed for by someone living with, or visiting, the household. Sincethe majority, if not all, of mail issuance which requires a signed receiptby the household is sent by certified mail, the suggestion is acceptedand the wording in andSection; 274.6(a)(2) has been changed to indicate eithertype of signature-required mailing. The Postal Service generally will notaccept coupons for registered mail, since that type of mail service permitsa declared value for insurance against losses. However, coupons sent bycertified mail may be able to be designated for restricted delivery, meaningthat only those individuals designated by the State agencies may receiveand sign for the coupons. The reference to registered mail has been retainedfor those issuance offices which are able to use that type of mail delivery.(andSection; 274.6(a)(2)) There was also a request for a definition of what is meant by the phrase``* * * or otherwise recouped by the State agency * * *'' in referenceto replacement issuances which should not be considered countable (andSection;274.6(b)(2)(iv)(A)). The phrase refers to a replacement being made in asituation in which the household later notifies the State agency that thehousehold has received the original allotment. If the original allotmentis not returned, the State agency may recoup the replacement by a voluntarycash or coupon reimbursement from the household, or through the reductionof subsequent allotments under terms worked out with the household. Untilthe State agency receives full reimbursement for the original allotment,the replacement should be deemed countable. (andSection; 274.6(b)(2)(iv)).One respondent believes that the one-limit replacement policy for authorizationdocuments stolen after receipt should remain, since in most jurisdictionsa stolen property report can be filed based solely on the complainant'sword. Since the State agency can later check to see who redeemed the originalATP and can compare signatures and/or reconciliation numbers appearingon the replacement ATP, the State agency would have recourse in filinga claim against the household, if necessary. While we continue to encouragethe State agencies to reconcile ATPs and to aggressively pursue claims,we want to ease the State agencies' burdens by having them track only onelimit. Therefore, we have not accepted the comment and have made no changein the proposal. (andSection; 274.6(b)(2)(i)) Another commenter on the same provision requested that the words ``* ** or a serialized ID area'' be added to the third sentence of andSection;274.6(f)(1) to cover all situations in which numbered IDs are used. However,there are areas which use ``serialized'' IDs voluntarily, and the annotationof the ID number on the reverse of the ATP is not required. Therefore,the suggested wording was not accepted. Two commenters requested that State agencies not be held liable for replacementissuances made beyond the six-month or two-replacement limits if the Stateagencies have been unable to determine the countability of previous replacementswithin the same period. The intent of the provision is that all replacementsare to be considered countable unless verified otherwise. Beyond that,the Department thinks that the six-month period is sufficient time forState agencies to determine the countability of a replacement through thereconciliation of the original authorization document or the receipt ofa signed proof-of-receipt card for certified or registered mail delivery.In a situation of a third request for a replacement before all previousreplacements had been reconciled, action on the third replacement shallbe held until the State agency can determine that the limit on countablereplacements has not been reached even if such a determination requiresan administrative hearing or judicial proceeding. There may be a delaypast the 10-day limit on providing replacements until that verificationcan be made. If a previous replacement is verified as non-countable, replacementbenefits shall be issued to the household. (andSection; 274.6(d)(1)(ii))Commenting on mail losses, another individual expressed the point thatlosses of certified mail should not be considered countable when thereis no record of receipt and the coupons are not returned to the State agency.If such a situation happens, the State agency shall request from the PostalService either the proof of delivery or the return of the coupons. In themeantime, the replacement shall be determined countable, since the householdcould possibly have received the coupons without the required signature,or the signed receipt could have been lost prior to being returned to theState agency. (andSection; 274.6(b)(2)(iv)) In response to the proposed andSection; 274.6(h)(2), a commenter expressedconcern that the Department was requiring State agencies to maintain Statewidelistings of replacements. It is the commenter's opinion that tracking couldbest be done at the local level. There is no requirement for Statewidelistings; the term ``State agency'' is used only to denote responsibilityfor compliance with the provisions. Even in those States that have mailissuance from one control point, there need not be one centralized replacementlisting since the regulations permit a notation about replacements in casefiles. The requirement is for an accessible list or notation for each replacement.A commenter questioned what the correct action would be in a situationin which a replacement was issued after the completion of the Form <T3>FNS-259 </T3>for the quarter in which the original issuance was made.The replacement should be shown for the month the replacement is actuallymade, as stated in the instructions on the form, rather than the rnonthin which the request is received by the State agency, since there is notan actual decrease in coupon inventory until the replacement is issued.Another commenter questioned whether or not a replacement issued laterthan the 10- or 15-day allowable period due to the inability of the Stateagency to determine the countability of a previous replacement should beconsidered restored benefits. A justified delay in making a replacementis not grounds for having the issuance considered restored benefits. However,if a State agency denies a third replacement request because it would becountable and the household had obtained the limit of two in six monthsand the State agency later determines a previous replacement to be noncountable,the benefits issued as a result would be restored benefits. (andSection;274.6(a)) 15. Time Frames for Requesting Replacements The Department proposed to amend the regulations which required that thereplacement of a non-received issuance must be requested during the periodof intended use of the original issuance. Since there had been many questionsraised about the policy of ``period of intended use'', the rules were re-examinedand it was proposed that all requests for replacements be made within 10days of the normal receipt date (ATPs or coupons not received in the mail)or 10 days from the occurrence of a particular incident (theft of ATP,receipt of partial allotment, or destruction of ATP, coupons or food ina household disaster). Eighteen commenters responded to this portion of the replacement rules.Only two comments supported the 10-day limit for requesting replacements.The majority felt that the change from ``period of intended use'' to 10days was far too restrictive, especially in mail issuance where there canbe so much variation in the delivery date of benefits, particularly inthe first few months of certification. Also, it seems reasonable that byallowing households more time to request a replacment, the State agencyis allowing more time for the household to receive the original allotment,whether it was lost in the mail, or lost, but not destroyed, in a householddisaster. In addition, there may be instances in which a household maynot be physically able to make the request for replacement for the non-receiptof benefits within a 10-day limit, such as those households which haveelderly or disabled members. The Department has reconsidered the proposal in light of these commentsand has decided to retain the two-part standard. For authorization documentsand coupons lost in, or stolen from, the mail, the request for replacementsmust be made during the period of intended use, which means the month forwhich the benefits were not received. If the original issuance was madeafter the 20th of the month, the recipient would have until the end ofthe following month to obtain a replacement. In instances of theft of anauthorization document from a household, or the accidental destructionof an authorization document in the possession of a household or the lossof coupons or food purchased with food stamps in a household misfortune,the report and request for replacement must be made within 10 days of thespecific incident. (andSection; 274.6(b)) 16. The Amount of the Replacement Previous regulations did not address setting any specific limit on theamount that could be replaced for stolen, nonreceived or destroyed authorizationdocuments, or nonreceived coupons. The rules did set a maximum of one month'sallotment on the replacement of coupons and food (or a combination thereof)destroyed in a household misfortune. Subsequent interpretation, however,extended the limit of one month's benefits to authorization document replacementsalso. This limit was applied regardless of whether the issuance includedrestored benefits. The Department proposed, with one change, to place the interpretation notedabove into the rules. Thus, State agencies would issue replacements, withinthe required time frame, in the maximum of one month's benefits. The exceptionarises if the replacement is for restored benefits. In such a case, a replacementshall be made for the full value of the restored benefits not receivedby a household. To minimize losses, State agencies are encouraged to providealternative forms of issuance, such as certified or registered mail ordirect delivery, when substantial restored benefits are involved. Therewas one positive comment. The proposed wording is retained in the finalrule. (andSection; 274.6(b)(3)) 17. Time Limits for Issuing Replacements Seven commenters responded to this portion of the rule which proposed tomodify the requirement that State agencies issue replacements within 10days of the requests in all situations. The proposed rule modified therule to permit State agencies to delay the issuance of a third replacementbeyond the 10-day limit, if need be, in order to determine whether or notthe previous two replacements were countable. The Department also proposedto specify that the issuance of a replacement would not be made until thehousehold submitted a signed statement of non-receipt. If the statementwere not submitted to the State agency within 10 days of the request, noreplacement would be issued. Finally, the proposed rule would have allowedState agencies which use certified/registered mail, a maximum of 15 daysfrom the date of the request for a replacement to issue the replacement.This was seen as necessary since the Postal Service, on some occasions,is unable to provide the State agencies with signed receipts in time forthe State agencies to verify receipt of benefits prior to issuing replacements.Requiring State agencies to issue replacements before verification wouldnegate the added protection afforded by certified/registered mail. (andSection;274.6(d)(1))Of the seven comments received, six supported the proposed changes. Onecommenter stated that a third replacement within a six-month period shouldbe made automatically, within the 10-day period, if the household requestingthe replacement had requested an alternative issuance delivery method afterthe second replacement, but the State agency had not yet made the change.The Department thinks that this would unnecessarily complicate the replacementprovision, especially if the second and third replacements were in successivemonths. For example, if a second replacement were requested on the 20thof the month and a third requested on the 10th of the following month,the time period between the two replacements may be too short to allowthe State agency to implement an alternative issuance method, consideringthat replacements may be requested anytime during the month. If the secondreplacement had not yet been determined to be non-countable, the thirdrequest would also have to be delayed until the State agency could makethat determination. Therefore, the proposed rule is implemented in thisfinal rule. (andSection; 274.6(d)) 18. Replacement of Mutilated Coupons and ATPs Four comments were received, all but one of which supported the proposalwhich added authority for the replacement of improperly manufactured ormutilated authorization documents. The adverse commenter objected to theuse of the ``three-fifths'' requirement for the replacement of mutilatedcoupons. This is a security requirement from the Department of the Treasuryand, therefore, cannot be changed or eliminated. It is applicable to currencyas well as food stamps, and is designed to prevent coupons from being tornapproximately in half, with each half subsequently being redeemed or replacedat face value. The final rule has been clarified to state that householdscannot receive a replacement for stolen coupons, and that improperly manufacturedor mutilated authorization documents must be surrendered to the State agency.(andSection; 274.6(f)(4)) 19. Alternate Issuance System for a Household That portion of the proposed rule which required a State agency to offera household an alternate issuance system after the first report of non-receipt,to automatically place the household in an alternate system after a secondreport of non-receipt, and to retain the household in that system for aminimum of six months, prompted five comments. Two commenters were opposedto the six-month period, stating that State agencies should be able todetermine the length of time for the alternate system. Another commenterthought that in those areas that have only one form of issuance, the provisionfor an alternate system should be waived. In any issuance system, thereare always options which are available, even though they may have to beaccomplished manually. The Department has reviewed the comments and hasdecided to retain the current policy which permits State agencies to retaina household in an alternative issuance system for a length of time theState agency determines to be necessary, since that policy affords flexibilityfor individual situations. (andSection; 274.6(g)) 20. Documentation and Reconciliation of Replacement Issuances All four of the comments received were opposed to the part of the proposedrule requiring that replacements be reconciled to the month they are issuedfor, as well as the month in which they are actually issued. Commentersfelt that ``double posting'' creates additional complications for the reconciliationprocess. Since in the majority of replacement situations there is alreadysome notation and reconciliation for the initial issuance when the replacementis requested, making an additional notation and reconciliation for thesame benefits when issued later does seem to be  duplicative. Therefore,the requirement for posting the replacement to the month issued for, aswell as for the month actually issued, has been finalized as an optionfor those State agencies which find it useful. All other proposed provisionsare retained in this final rule. (andSection; 274.6(h)) 21. Coupon Management The Department proposed four changes in this area of the current rules.First, it was proposed to consolidate within Part 274 the destruction requirementat andSection; 273.18(i) for coupons used to pay State agency claims againsthouseholds, and the requirement at andSection; 274.8(b) regarding couponsthat are mutilated or improperly manufactured. A second proposal pertainingto the destruction of coupons eliminated the limit of $500 which was placedon the amount of coupons a State agency could destroy without prior approvalfrom FNS. The one exception to this revision was whole boxes of improperlymanufactured coupons. Third, the Department proposed to add the requirementthat unusable coupons be disposed of within 30 days from the close of themonth in which they were received from a household or identified as beingmutilated or improperly manufactured. Finally, it was proposed to clarifyand revise destruction reporting procedures by allowing State agencies,at their option, to consolidate destruction reporting for unusable couponsacquired through claims collections. The Department received eight comments on this proposed change. A majorityagreed with the provision, yet offered specific comment. There were nocomments related to the consolidation of the destruction requirements currentlyfound in two separate sections in the rules. There also were no commentsregarding the elimination of the dollar limit on the value of coupons thatcould be destroyed without prior approval from FNS.Another commenter was concerned with the provision that requires replacementsfor improperly manufactured and mutilated coupons to be made at issuancepoints. Rather than replacing the coupons, the commenter suggests thatthe coupons be examined by the State agency prior to issuance, and thenreported on the <T3>FNS-471, </T3>Coupon Account and Destruction Report. The State agency(coupon issuer) should try to eliminate improperly manufactured and mutilatedcoupons from issuance. However, in those situations where it is not feasibleto do so, such as mail issuance or direct delivery of benefits by an entityother than the State agency, the replacements must be made and the improperlymanufactured or mutilated coupons returned to the State agency and destroyed.(andSection; 274.6(a)(1)(i)) Another commenter thought there should be guidelines for the retentionof the information of coupon shipments within a State (routes to be taken,shipment departure time and estimated arrival time), as required in andSection;274.7(c)(iii). Since the information is ``before the fact'' with respectto the actual shipping, once the coupons have arrived at the designatedpoint, the State agency may dispose of the information. Wording is addedto the final version of andSection; 274.7(c)(iii) to clarify the option.One comment was received regarding the use and destruction of specimencoupons, in which the commenter thought there should be more specific instructionsas to who may use specimen coupons. Specimen coupons may be provided uponwritten request, to any State or local agency concerned with the administrationof the Program or enforcement of its rules, and to authorized food firmsfor the education and training of employees on Program operations. Specimencoupons may not be provided to individuals for purposes of display or collection.This specific instruction concerning who may use specimen coupons is notnew with this rule. However, clarifying wording has been added. (andSection;274.7(d)) The same commenter expressed the opinion that the destruction of specimencoupons should be done at the FNS regional offices for purposes of accountability.There is no accountability, as such, for specimen coupons. A perpetualrecord is maintained for the distribution of specimen coupons, for thepurpose of determining to whom any particular specimen coupons were issued,in case it is determined that specimen coupons have been presented forredemption. The wording in the proposed rule is retained as final. (andSection;274.7(d)(2)) Two comments were received regarding the time limit for destruction ofunusable coupons. One commenter suggested that State agencies be allowed30 days after FNS approval, rather than 30 days from the end of the month,in which to destroy boxes of improperly manufactured coupons. The Departmentis concerned about the security aspects of storing boxes of unusable couponsfor an extended period. Therefore, the proposal places an explicit timelimit on required actions by the State agency and an implicit time limiton FNS. In any situation dealing with boxes of improperly manufacturedcoupons, the State agency must destroy the box of coupons if the 30-dayperiod is reached without the State agency receiving destruction approvalfrom FNS, and document the manufacturing irregularity and the book numbers,and retain a copy of the State agency's request to FNS for permission todestroy. Another commenter thought that the time limit for destructionshould correspond to the time limit for the submission of the <T3>FNS-250 </T3>and <T3>FNS-209 </T3>reports, and should not be more stringent. Again, theDepartment is concerned about the storage of unusable coupons for any extendedperiod; therefore, the requirement of 30 days after the end of the monthis retained as final. (andSection; 274.7(f)) There was one comment received concerning the use of coupons returned toState agencies as payment of claims, and coupons returned as undeliverableto the intended households. The commenter stated that returning such couponsto inventory creates accountability problems. The Department believes thatthe automatic destruction of returned coupons is wasteful if the couponsare in book form, complete, with original and unsigned covers. Therefore,the provisions of the proposed rule are retained in the final rule. (andSection;274.7(g)) A final comment in this area questioned the type and extent of the documentationrequired for reports sent to the State agency concerning improperly manufacturedand mutilated coupons. The documentation is not required if the State agencyinspects the coupons at the issuance or storage points. If a report isprepared for submission to the State agency, it should contain enough informationto enable the State agency to identify the coupons to FNS and the manufacturer.Dependent upon the extent of the damage, the beginning and ending numbersof the books involved should be noted. In addition, the specific problemshould be noted in detail, such as a specific denomination coupon omittedfrom a book and staples not penetrating the entire book. The comprehensivenessof the content of the documentation is determined by the State agencies.No changes in the proposed rule resulted from this comment. (andSection;274.8(e)) 22. Return and Exchange of Coupons The Food Stamp Act of 1977 eliminated the requirement that Program recipientspay cash for a portion of their benefits. Because there was a phase-inperiod for this provision, the rules that were issued to implement theprovision contained provisions explaining how certain qualified householdscould obtain refunds for the cash requirement they had paid. The provisionsfor refunds were contained in andSection; 274.11. Since the time for obtainingrefunds has ended, the Department proposed to eliminate the rules governingthem. Thus, the provisions of andSection; 274.11 (a) through (d) have beeneliminated by this rule. The provision pertaining to the exchange of old-seriescoupons has been relocated to andSection; 274.7(h) and has been revised toeliminate sole reference to the previously-issued 50-cent coupon, and madeapplicable to any coupon denomination no longer used, now and in the future.No comments were received on this editorial change. The Department is also making a technical amendment concerning the returnand exchange of coupons by recipients and non-recipients. In the proposedrule, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of andSection; 274.11 of the currentrules were removed, since the paragraphs concerned requests for refundsof the purchase requirement. In paragraph (c), there is reference to Form<T3>FNS-287, </T3>Request for Reimbursement or Notification of Return ofUnused Food Coupons for Refund. When the purchase requirement was eliminated,the Form <T3>FNS-287 </T3>was discontinued, and the new Form <T3>FNS-135, </T3>Affidavit of Return or Exchange of Food Coupons, wasput into use. The new form covers not only the return of unused couponsbut also the exchange of old-series coupons, coupons received in paymentof a recipient claim, and the exchange of mutilated or improperly manufacturedcoupons. However, reference to the Form <T3>FNS-135 </T3>was unintentionally omitted from the current rules andthe April 9, 1986 proposed rule. This rule reinstates the provision inthe rules. The Form <T3>FNS-135 </T3>was designed to be a receipt for, as well as verificationof, the person returning or exchanging coupons, and is to accompany theForm <T3>FNS-471, </T3>Coupon Account and Destruction Report, as proof of receiptof the coupons by the State agency. The two forms together serve as documentationby the State agency  for coupons destroyed upon receipt, and coupons whichare returned to inventory. Therefore, reference to the Form <T3>FNS-135 </T3>has been added to the sections of this rule which concernthe return or exchange of coupons. The amendment does not change the principlenor the policy intent of the provisions affected. (andSection;andSection; 274.6(f)(4)and 274.7(f)) 23. Identification Cards One commenter misunderstood the wording in andSection; 274.10(a)(1) whichstates in part that ``all persons listed on the identification (ID) cardshall sign the card prior to its use.'' The commenter thought that theprovision meant that all persons listed on the card had to sign the cardbefore the card could be used by any of those listed. The wording has beenclarified to indicate that, before a person listed on the ID card may usethe ID card, the person must sign the card. (andSection; 274.10(a)(1))24. Photo IDs The comment received on the use of photo IDs concerned their use by authorizedrepresentatives for elderly/homebound/disabled recipients. The commenterfelt that because the authorized representatives for these recipients areusually home-health aides who change frequently as authorized representatives,they should not have to use the photo IDs. In those areas in which thephoto ID is mandated, it is done so because of the risk of theft and fraudinvolved in a populous area and not because of who may be authorized touse an ID. Therefore, in those areas where photo IDs are required, thephoto ID (of the authorized representative) must be used, regardless ofthe fact that the authorized representative may change frequently. (andSection;274.10(b)) 25. Identification Card Requirements and Substitution Proposed andSection; 274.10 contained only a minor change in the currentID card rules, specifically concerning photo IDs. The change is mandatedby section 1528 of the Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198. Also,the proposed rulemaking consolidated and restructured current ID card requirementscontained in andSection; 273.10 (f) and (g), andSection; 274.2 (e) and (f),and andSection; 274.7(c). Therefore, these sections were removed from theircurrent locations in the rules, combined, and inserted as andSection; 274.10of the proposed rules. In the change regarding photo IDs, Congress allowedState agencies to permit a member of a household to comply with the FNSphoto ID card requirement by presenting a photo ID used to receive benefitsunder a public welfare or public assistance Program. Congress also wantedFNS to consider the cost effectiveness in determining where photo IDs mustbe used. Since the agency currently does this, no regulatory change isrequired. No comments were received on this change. (andSection; 274.10(b)(3)(iii))26. Issuance Record Retention A suggestion was made to add ``rosters and lists'' to those issuance andreconciliation documents which should be retained by the State agenciesfor three years. Since rosters and lists are commonly produced in issuancesystems, the wording is accepted and added to andSection; 274.11(a)(1). 27. Quality Control The Department proposed to revise the provision pertaining to active-casereviews to specify that such reviews must not only determine if the householdwas entitled to receive benefits, but also whether or not the householdwas issued the correct allotment, by comparing the eligibility data andthe amount authorized on the master issuance file with the amount shownon the record-for-issuance file. By making this comparison, the reasonfor any incorrect issuance which may have occurred could be determined,and the liability correctly assigned to either certification or issuanceactivities. All four comments received on this provision were opposed. One commentstated that there was no convincing evidence that error rates would notincrease as a result of this provision, and that there are methods otherthan quality control to check for issuance errors. With the new definitionfor issuance and the creation of the record-for-issuance, a clear demarcationhas been made between certification and issuance. The only way to determineif there has been an issuance error in any particular situation is to comparethe record-for-issuance against a file on the other side of the ``line'',which would be the master issuance file. What was proposed was a checkof the amount on the master issuance file, which is accomplished by matchingthe eligibility data against the master issuance file. If the amount authorizedby the eligibility data does not match the amount on the master issuancefile in any specific case, there is a certification error covered by qualitycontrol. If a record-for-issuance amount does not match the correspondingamount of the master issuance file, there is an error covered by issuanceliability. The Department believes that error rates will not be affectedsignificantly with the additional check of the individual case recordsagainst the master issuance file, especially considering that most automatedissuance systems are currently employing this check. (andSection; 275.10)Another commenter was concerned about the fact that data entry errors resultingin subsequent replacement issuance errors would be counted as issuanceerrors and would not be covered by quality control or negligence billings.If such replacement errors were the result of data entry errors from informationon eligibility, the resultant error, causing the issuance of an incorrectreplacement amount, would still be classified as a certification errorsince it was during the certification process that an error was first made.Again, an issuance error is not concerned with the correctness of the amountof benefits authorized as determined by eligibility standards. Issuanceliability is concerned with whether or not the amount issued matches theamount authorized for a particular household. (andSection; 275.10) We have discovered that the language in the proposed rule did not fullyconform with our intentions for the rule as correctly stated in the preamble.In order to clarify that quality control (QC) reviews will continue todetermine whether a given household received the correct issuance, givenits circumstances as of the review date, we have modified the proposedlanguage. Therefore, the Department is revising the provision concerningactive cases to specify that such reviews must still determine if the householdwas entitled to receive, and did receive, the correct allotment by comparingthe eligibility data against the amount authorized on the master issuancefile.28. State Agency Liabilities Another commenter expressed belief that the proposed rule which held Stateagencies liable for transacted ATPs which had been altered or which werecounterfeit was too strict, stating that this was too great a responsibilityto be placed on issuance cashiers. The Department did not mean to implythat cashiers would be personally liable. However, the State agency mustbe held responsible, since ATPs are procured, transacted and reconciledby the State agency. State agency personnel, and contract personnel, mustbe familiar with negotiable forms involving food stamps. Therefore, theprovisions of the proposed rule are retained in the final rule. (andSection;276.2(b)(1)(iii)) A second commenter stated that the Department should review the court'sdecision in <T3>Perales v. Block, </T3>751 F.2d 95 (2nd Cir. 1984), concerning thequestion of a State agency's liability in the negotiation of expired ATPs.The court decision cited by the commenter applied to eight-day ATPs previouslyissued in New York City. This short-term ATP was used to decrease the numberof invalid replacements. However, the court indicated that if an originalof an eight-day ATP were presented for redemption after eight days, theATP had to be honored, or the recipient issued another ATP valid for atotal of 30 days. The court did not invalidate the Department's policyof holding State agencies liable as the policy applies to a regular, or30-day, ATP. Therefore, the Department is finalizing the proposed liabilityprovision. (andSection; 276.2(b)(2)(iii)) The Department's current policy on issuance documentation has been clarifiedto state that all coupon issuance has to be documented, and that the documentationhas to be available to the Department. If a situation arises in which theprimary documentation is unavailable, such as the loss of transacted ATPsin transit from an issuance agent to the State agency, the State agencyshould try to immediately reconstruct the documentation from other sources,if possible. (andSection; 276.2(a)) Wording has also been added to clarify the policy that State agencies areliable for losses of coupon issuance which occur during Federal, Stateand local investigations unless the investigations have been reported <T3>directly </T3>to FNS prior to the losses and FNS agrees to accept anylosses which may occur. (andSection; 276.2(b)(2)) In issuance systems which utilize a record-for-issuance file, it is theresponsibility of the issuance unit to obtain from the master issuancefile only those households which are certified to receive benefits forthe current month. We have clarified this policy by stating specificallythat State agencies will assume an issuance liability for benefits issuedto households not currently certified. (andSection; 276.2(b)(2)(vi)) 29. Mail Issuance Liability The Department proposed permitting State agencies to choose from a three-levelreporting and liability assessment system. State agencies could reportmail losses at the project-area level, with a loss tolerance of one-half(.5) percent; at an administrative-unit level, with a loss tolerance ofthirty-five hundreths (.35) percent; or, at a Statewide level, with a toleranceof three-tenths (.3) percent. Each State agency would be allowed to choose(or change) its reporting level once a year. Concerning the proposed three-level system for reporting and assessingliabilities, thirteen comments were received; six commenters agreed withthe proposed change, and seven opposed it. Of those opposing the change,five commenters felt the tolerance levels (percentages) were too low, andthat they were unrealistic and punitive. One commenter stated that thetolerance levels should be forty-five hundreths (.45) percent for administrativeunits and forty hundreths (.40) percent for project areas (lower than theproposed tolerance). Another commenter thought that the tolerance levelfor administrative units should be forty-five hundreths (.45) percent,since many administrative units are smaller than project areas. Anothercommenter stated that the tolerance level of thirty-five hundreths (.35)percent is too high for densely-populated areas. The last commenter whosuggested different tolerance levels thought that the level for State reportingshould be forty-five hundreths (.45) percent, and for administrative andproject area levels, fifty hundreths (.50) percent. The tolerance percentageproposed for the project area level was the same as that which had beenin effect since 1983. The percentages proposed for the administrative unitand State levels were commensurate with the larger issuance bases theyrepresent. The project area reporting level was established to enable FNSto identify areas experiencing high losses of coupons in the mail. Respondingto State agencies that wanted flexibility in their reporting, since somehad Statewide mail issuance from one point and others were administeredon an administrative unit basis, the Department proposed the other twolevels for reporting. However, it was still a concern of the Departmentthat areas experiencing high losses might be ``hidden'' when combined withlarger reporting units. The Department feels that the proposed tolerancelevels represent a fair balance between mail losses, regardless of fault,and the Department's obligation to seek reimbursement for those losses.Therefore, so as not to conceal and compensate for high loss areas, thetolerance level was decreased with each increase in reporting unit size.The Department feels that the tolerance levels selected are reasonable,and the proposed tolerance levels are retained as final. (andSection; 276.2(b)(3))Another commenter thinks that State agencies should not be limited to theuse of current administrative units for reporting losses, but should beallowed to change the units when needed, such as grouping postal jurisdictionsfor easier investigations of mail losses. Again, the Department is concernedthat allowing changes in administrative units, for the purpose of reportinglosses, may lead to the absorbing of higher losses by the Department. Ifa State agency chooses to report losses by project area or Statewide levelthe first year of the new tolerance levels, the State agency may, duringthat time, form administrative units for the purpose of Program administration.If the State agency decides to report by administrative-unit level forthe second year, it may do so, but it may not create any new or changedadministrative units during that year, for the sole purpose of reportingmail losses, without prior approval. By keeping administrative units stable,FNS will be able to more accurately track losses in particular areas overa period of time. If administrative units were to change during a reportingyear, continued losses in a particular area might go unnoticed. (andSection;276.2(b)(3))The focus of another comment was that State agencies should be able tochoose their reporting and assessment levels semi-annually, rather thanannually, for more flexibility. The Department feels that permitting changesmore frequently than annually would result in confusion in reporting. Further,State agencies should do everything to resolve and reduce the losses whilein a current plan before simply changing to a lower tolerance and a largergeographic area. The Department thinks that six months is too short a periodto review the problems, decide on solutions and implement the necessaryactions.A comment from another source was a request for definitions of ``projectarea level'' and ``administrative unit level''. Project-area level is reportingmail issuance losses for individual project areas which most commonly arecounties or independent cities. An administrative unit is usually largerthan a project area but smaller than Statewide. The unit may have beencreated for governmental purposes and adopted by the State agency for Programadministration purposes. Such a unit might be a welfare district, a PostalService zone, or an area which has been created specifically for administrationof the Food Stamp Program.The same commenter asked how State agencies would handle two project areaswhich are currently being reported singly, with the rest of the State reportedas one separate unit. In such a situation, the State agency may continueto report the two project areas singly, and combine the remaining projectareas into an administrative unit. Administrative units may not be createdby the State agencies for the sole purpose of reporting mail issuance losses.Concerning that portion of the proposed rule which dealt with the Stateagencies' liabilities for losses incurred by the Postal Service, sevencomments were received, with only one in agreement. Those opposed unanimouslystated that the Postal Service must be held accountable for its own losses,especially if State agencies have paid for premium service (certified orregistered mail).While the Postal Service will be requested to account for all food stampsit handles, the Department realizes that not all food stamp mail lossesare the fault of the Postal Service, since there are thefts from mail boxesinvolving coupons sent by regular mail. When there is a loss of couponsfrom regular mail service, it is not always possible to determine whetherit involves theft after delivery, or loss before delivery. Therefore, ratherthan automatically assigning each loss to a particular party, the Departmenthas decided to absorb losses below specific tolerance levels, regardlessof where liability is assigned. Even though State agencies are being relievedof some losses, the Department expects State agencies to make sure thatbenefits are received on time, that more secure delivery methods are employedwhen losses occur, and that the Postal Service is requested to accountfor benefits which are sent by premium service, but not received by households.(andSection; 276.2(b)(3))30. Rescission of Proposed ProvisionOn April 2, 1982, the Department published a proposed rule at 47 FR 14160(Administrative Flexibility Rule) which contained a provision allowingState agencies increased flexibility in the staggered issuance of ATPsand coupons. The provision was later determined to be more involved withissuance provisions than with certification and administration provisions,and the proposed regulatory change was omitted from the final rule publishedat 47 FR 53309 on November 26, 1982. The same regulatory change was laterincorporated into the Food Stamp Issuance and Issuance Liability Rulespublished April 9, 1986, as a result of the same provision in the FoodSecurity Act of 1985. The provision from the April 2, 1982 rule shouldhave been rescinded with publication of the April 9, 1986 rule, but wasinadvertantly omitted. The April 2, 1982 provision is rescinded with thisfinal rule, and the staggererd issuance provision from the April 9, 1986rule becomes final with this rule.31. FNS Shipment of CouponsThe Department's proposal to have State agency coupon receiving pointsapproved by FNS received no comments. Therefore, the amendment is adoptedwithout change. (andSection; 274.7(c)(3))32. MiscellaneousIn andSection; 273.2, the proposed amendment to paragraph (g)(1) consistedonly of the addition of the reference to andSection; 274.2(b) in the firstsentence. Since that was the only change, the paragraph has been replacedwith simply the reference to that addition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Implementation</ITAG>All provisions shall be implemented April 1, 1989, with the following exceptions:a.

(b) <T3>Contracting or delegating issuance responsibilities. </T3>State agenciesmay assign to others such as banks, savings and loan associations, thePostal Service, community action and migrant service agencies, and othercommercial businesses, the responsibility for the issuance and storageof food coupons. State agencies may permit contractors to subcontract assignedissuance responsibilities. (1) Any assignment of issuance functions shall clearly delineate the responsibilitiesof both parties. The State agency remains responsible, regardless of anyagreements to the contrary, for ensuring that assigned duties are carriedout in accordance with these regulations. In addition, the State agencyis strictly liable to FNS for all losses of coupons, even if those lossesare the result of the performance of issuance, security, or accountabilityduties by another party. (2) All issuance contracts shall follow procurement standards set forthin Part 277. (3) The State agency shall not assign the issuance of coupons to any retailfood firm unless the State agency provides evidence that such an arrangementis needed to maintain or increase the efficient and effective operationof the Program, as described below. (i) Coupons may be issued inside or within a retail food store, if theissuance is performed by a bank, credit union or other financial organizationindependent of the retail food store. (ii) Coupons may be issued on-site by a retail food store under the followingconditions: (A) The State agency adequately documents that unless the retail food storeis permitted to issue coupons on-site there will be a hardship, not justan inconvenience, to recipients. The State agency shall contract directlywith the retail food firm and shall provide oversight to such entity; or(B) In the absence of the hardship documentation, a retail food firm itselfmay perform issuance as a subcontractor to a bank, credit union or otherindependent financial organization, with strict oversight by the financialorganization. (4) The State agency may contract with the U.S. Postal Service for theissuance of benefits. The Department and the Postal Service have signedan agreement which governs benefit issuance by the Postal Service. A Stateagency's contract with the Postal Service does not exempt the State agencyfrom the requirement that it comply with these regulations. However, Stateagencies may negotiate contracts with the Postal Service on all terms andconditions as long as such provisions do not conflict with these regulations.(5) In project areas or parts of project areas where FNS has required aPhotographic identification (Photo ID) system to be used, the State agencyshall include in any contract or agreement with an issuing agent a provisionestablishing the agent's liability to the State agency for the face valueof coupons issued in any authorization document transaction where the authorizationdocument is found to have been stolen or otherwise not received by thehousehold certified as eligible, if the cashier has not fulfilled the requirementscontained in andSection; 274.10. This same provision shall apply to issuancecontracts in project areas or parts of project areas where FNS has granteda waiver or waivers of any provision(s) of the Photo ID requirements basedon a determination that State agency alternatives will not compromise thesecurity of the ID system. (c) <T3>State monitoring of coupon issuers. </T3>The State agency's accountabilitysystem shall include procedures for monitoring coupon issuers to assurethat the day-to-day operations of all coupon issuers comply with theseregulations, to identify and correct deficiencies, and to report violationsof the Act or regulations to FNS. (1) The State agency shall conduct an onsite review of each coupon issuerand bulk storage point at least once every three years. All offices orunits of a coupon issuer are subject to this review requirement. The Stateagency shall base each review on the specific activities performed by eachcoupon issuer or bulk storage point. A physical inventory of coupons shallbe taken at each location and that count compared with perpetual inventoryrecords and the monthly reports of the coupon issuer or bulk storage point.This review may be conducted at branch sites as well as the main officesof each issuer and bulk storage point that operates in more than one office.Except in unusual circumstances, the Postal Inspection Service will conductonsite reviews of Postal Service issuance operations. (2) This review requirement may be fulfilled in part or in total by theperformance reporting review system, Part 275. The State agency may delegatethis review responsibility to another unit of the State government or contractwith an outside firm with expertise in auditing and accounting. State agenciesmay use the results of reviews of coupon issuers by independent audit oraccounting firms as long as the food coupon issuance operations of thecoupon issuer are included in the review.(d) <T3>Changes. </T3>The State agency shall inform FNS whenever a projectarea, issuance point, reconciliation point, replacement point, bulk storagereporting point or coupon shipment receiving point is created, relocated,or terminated. The State agency shall report the change at least 30 daysprior to the effective date of the change. Initial notification may bemade by telephone but the State agency shall confirm the information inwriting as soon as possible.(e) <T3>Advance planning documentation. </T3>State agencies must comply withthe procurement requirements of Part 277 for the acquisition, design, development,or installation of automated data processing (ADP) equipment. With certainexceptions detailed in Part 277, State agencies must receive prior approvalfor the design and acquisition of ADP systems through submission of advanceplanning documents (APD's).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 274.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Providing benefits to participants.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Each State agency is responsible for the timely and accurateissuance of benefits to certified eligible households in accordance withthese regulations. Those households comprised of elderly or disabled memberswhich have difficulty reaching issuance offices, and households which donot reside in a permanent dwelling or of a fixed mailing address shallbe given assistance in obtaining their regular monthly benefits. Stateagencies shall assist these households by arranging for the mail issuanceof coupons to them, by assisting them in finding authorized representativeswho can act on their behalf, or by using other appropriate means.(b) <T3>Newly-certified households.</T3>(1) All newly-certified households, except those that are given expeditedservice, shall be given an opportunity to participate no later than 30calendar days following the date the application was filed. An opportunityto participate consists of providing households with coupons or authorizationdocuments and having issuance facilities open and available for the householdsto obtain their benefits. State agencies must mail authorization documentsor coupons in time to assure that the documents can be transacted, or thecoupons spent after they are received but before the 30-day standard expires.A household has not been provided an opportunity to participate withinthe 30-day standard if the authorization document or benefits are mailedon the 29th or 30th day. Neither has an opportunity to participate beenprovided if the authorization document is mailed on the 28th day but noissuance facility is open on the 30th day.(2) Households which apply for benefits during the last 15 days of themonth, which fulfill <T3>all </T3>eligibility requirements, and which are issued benefits duringthis period, must be issued benefits for their first full month of participationno later than the close of business on the eighth calendar day of thatmonth. The full month's benefits may be issued in a lump sum or may bedivided, with an initial and supplemental issuance; the supplemental issuanceshall not provide the households more benefits than the household is entitledto receive.(3) Newly-certified households that are given expedited service shall havebenefits provided as explained in andSection; 273.2(i). Households for whichverification has been postponed shall <T3>not </T3>be given the first full month's benefits by the eighth calendarday of that month unless the postponed verification is provided prior tothe eighth day, and shall be handled under the provisions contained inandSection; 273.2(i).(c) <T3>Ongoing households. </T3>All households shall be placed on an issuanceschedule so that they receive their benefits on or about the same dateeach month. The date upon which a household receives its initial allotmentafter certification need not be the date that the household must receiveits subsequent allotments.(1) State agencies may stagger the issuance of benefits to households throughoutthe entire month. In doing so, however, State agencies shall not allowmore than 40 days to elapse between any two issuances provided to a household.State agencies that use direct mail issuance shall stagger issuances overat least ten days of the issuance month and may stagger issuances overthe entire issuance month. No matter what issuance schedule a State agencyadopts, it shall adhere to the reporting requirements specified in andSection;274.4.(2) When a participating household is transferred from one issuance procedureto another, which would result in more than 40 days elapsing between issuancesof benefits, the State agency may divide the first issuance under the newprocedure into two parts, with one part issued within the 40-day limit,and the second part, or supplemental issuance, issued on the establishedissuance date of the new procedure; the supplemental issuance cannot providethe household more benefits than the household is entitled to receive.(3) Notwithstanding the above provisions, in months in which benefits havebeen suspended under the provisions of andSection; 271.7, State agenciesmay stagger issuance to certified households following the end of the suspension.In such situations, State agencies may, at their option, stagger issuancefrom the date issuance resumes through the end of the month or over a five-dayperiod following the resumption of issuance, even if this results in benefitsbeing issued after the end of the month in which the suspension occurred.(d) <T3>Issuance services. </T3>State agencies are responsible for determiningthe location and hours of operation of issuance services. In doing so,State agencies shall ensure that the issuance schedules set forth in paragraphs(b) and (c) of this section are met. In addition, issuance authorizationdocuments, such as ATP cards, should be valid only in the geographic areawithin the State that is encompassed by the reconciliation system throughwhich the issuance will be processed; however, the validity area may beextended within the State at the State agency's option. State agenciesmay also restrict the validity of these documents to smaller areas or particularissuance sites with minimal practicable inconvenience to affected households.(e) <T3>Issuance of coupons to households. </T3>The State agency shall issuecoupon books in accordance with a table for coupon-book issuance providedby FNS, except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), and (e)(3) ofthis section. The State agency shall issue the coupon books in consecutiveserial number order whenever possible, starting with the lowest serialnumber in each coupon book denomination. The household member whose nameappears on the ID card shall sign the coupon books; if more than one nameappears, any named member may sign the books.(1) The State agency may deviate from the table if the specified couponbooks are unavailable.(2) Exceptions from the table are authorized for blind and visually-handicappedparticipants who request that all coupons be of one denomination. Recipientswho have no fixed address (homeless), and residents of shelters for batteredwomen and children, as defined in andSection; 271.2, and which are not authorizedby FNS to redeem through wholesalers, may request that all or part of theircoupons be of the $1 denomination. State agencies are authorized to grantthis request when feasible.(3) If a household is eligible for an allotment of $1, $3, or $5, the Stateagency shall adjust those allotments to $2, $4, or $6, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 274.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Issuance systems.</ITAG>(a) <T3>System classification. </T3>State agencies may issue benefits to householdsthrough any of the following three systems:(1) An authorization document system that uses a document produced foreach month's issuance. The intermediary document, such as an ATP, may bedistributed on a monthly basis to each household and surrendered by thehousehold to the coupon issuer, or provided monthly to issuers with eithersingle household authorizations or multiple household authorizations oneach (such as a computer-generated listing). For reconciliation and identificationpurposes, the authorization document shall contain the following:(i) Serial number;(ii) Case name and address;(iii) Case number;(iv) Allotment amount;(v) Benefit month or expiration date;(vi) Name of issuing project area; and,(vii) Space for signature of household member. An additional space foran authorized representative may be included.(2) A direct access system that directly accesses a master issuance fileat the time that benefits are issued to households. This system shall usemanual card access or an automated access to the master issuance file.Systems of this type include the manual Household Issuance Record (HIR)card system and on-line issuance terminals.(3) A mail issuance system that directly delivers coupons through the mailto households.(b) <T3>Other systems. </T3>A State agency may develop an issuance system whichcannot be readily categorized into one of the three systems described inparagraph (a) of this section. FNS shall prescribe the reporting and reconciliationrequirements which apply to that system.(c) <T3>Alternative benefit issuance system. </T3>(1) If the Secretary, inconsultation with the Office of the Inspector General, determines thatProgram integrity would be improved by changing the issuance system ofa State, the Secretary shall require the State agency to issue or delivercoupons using another method. The alternative method may be one of themethods described in paragraph (a) of this section, or the Secretary mayrequire a State agency to issue, in lieu of coupons, reusable documentsto be used as part of an automated data processing and information retrievalsystem and to be presented by, and returned to, recipients at retail foodfirms for the purpose of purchasing food. The determination of which alternativeto use will be made by FNS after consultation with the State agency. Thecost of conversion will be shared by the Department and the State agencyin accordance with the cost accounting provision of Part 277.(2) The cost of documents or systems which may be required as a resultof a permanent alternative issuance system pursuant to this section shallnot be imposed upon retail food firms participating in the Program.(d) <T3>System requirements. </T3>(1) The State agency shall establish a masterissuance file which is a composite of the issuance records of all certifiedfood stamp households. The State agency shall establish the master issuancefile in a manner compatible with its system used for maintaining case recordinformation and shall separate the information on the master issuance fileinto active and inactive case file categories. The master issuance fileshall contain all the information needed to identify certified households,issue household benefits, record the participation activity for each householdand supply all information necessary to fulfill the reporting requirementsprescribed in andSection; 274.4.(i) The master issuance file shall be kept current and accurate. It shallbe updated and maintained through the use of documents such as noticesof change and controls for expired certification periods.(ii) Before entering a household's data on the master issuance file, theState agency shall review the master issuance file to ensure that the householdis not currently participating in, or disqualified from, the Program. Ifan authorization document is issued under the expedited service requirementsof andSection;andSection; 273.2(i) and 274.2(b), the State agency shall completeas much of the master issuance file review as possible prior to issuingthe authorization document. Any uncompleted reviews shall be completedafter issuance and appropriate corrective action shall be taken to recoveroverissuance.(2) State agencies should divide issuance responsibilities between at leasttwo persons to prevent any single individual from having complete controlover the authorization of issuances and the issuances themselves. Responsibilitiesto be divided include maintenance of inventory records, assembly of benefitsand preparation of envelopes for mailing. If issuance functions in an officeare handled by one person, a second-party review shall be made to verifycoupon inventory, the reconciliation of the mail log, and the number ofmailings prepared.(3) State agencies shall establish controls to prevent a household fromconcurrently receiving benefits through more than one issuance system.(4) State agencies shall clearly identify issuances in their accountabilitysystems as initial, original, supplemental, replacement, or restored benefits.(5) State agencies shall establish a Statewide record of replacement issuancesgranted to households to prevent a household from receiving more than twocountable replacement issuances as defined in andSection; 274.6(b) in a six-monthperiod. (6) State agencies which issue benefits by mail shall, at a minimum, usefirst class mail and sturdy nonforwarding envelopes or packages to sendbenefits to households. (e) <T3>Validity periods. </T3>(1) State agencies shall establish validityperiods for issuances made in authorization document and direct accessissuance systems. A validity period is the time frame during which a householdmay obtain benefits by transacting an authorization document or receivingthe benefits directly at an issuance point. The validity period beginsthe day a household is issued its authorization document or the day a householdis authorized to pick up its issuance at an issuance point. If such dayis before the 20th day of the issuance month, the validity period shalllast until the end of that issuance month. If the validity period beginson or after the 20th day of the issuance month, the State agency has theoption of extending the validity period at least 30 days or until the endof the next issuance month. A household which does not transact its authorizationdocument or pick up its authorized issuance during the issuance's validityperiod shall lose its entitlement to the benefits and the State agencyshall not issue benefits to such a household for such a period. (2) State agencies experiencing excessive issuance losses may develop systemsthat have authorization documents that expire in shorter time frames thanthose set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. However, such systemsshall include methods that allow households the opportunity to obtain theirbenefits for the full validity period of a month's issuance. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 274.4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reconciliation and reporting. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Reconciliation. </T3>State agencies shall account for all issuancethrough a reconciliation process. The manner in which this is done variesdepending on the type of issuance system being used. (1) Described below are the required reconciliation procedures for eachtype of system. (i) In all issuance systems coupon issuers shall reconcile their issuancesdaily using daily tally sheets, cashiers' daily reports, tapes or printouts.(ii) In systems where a record-for-issuance is used, all issuances authorizedfor the month shall be merged into one record-for-issuance at the end ofeach month. All issuances made during the month shall then be posted tothe record-for-issuance. The record-for-issuance shall then be comparedwith the master issuance file. Findings from this comparison shall be reportedon the Form <T3>FNS-46 </T3>as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (iii) In systems where no record-for-issuance is used, issuances made duringeach month shall be reconciled to the master issuance file. Findings fromthis reconciliation shall be reported on the Form <T3>FNS-46 </T3>as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (iv) In addition to the reconciliation activity prescribed in the paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the following stepsshall be followed in authorization document systems: (A) The State agency shall determine and verify the transacted value ofauthorized coupon issuances. (B) Any batches of transacted authorization documents that do not reconcileshall be maintained intact by the State agency until the discrepancy isresolved with the coupon issuer and/or a review of the case files. (C) The State agency shall compare all transacted authorization documentswith the record-for-issuance or master issuance file as appropriate. Anydocuments that do not match with the record-for-issuance or master issuancefile shall be identified and reported as required in paragraph (b)(2) ofthis section. (b) <T3>Required reports. </T3>The State agency shall review and submit thefollowing reports to FNS on a monthly basis:(1) Form <T3>FNS-250, </T3>Food Coupon Accountability Report.(i) This report, executed monthly by coupon issuers and bulk storage points,shall be signed by the coupon issuer or appropriate official, certifyingthat the information is true and correct to the best of that person's knowledgeand belief.(ii) Coupon issuers and bulk storage points shall submit supporting documentationto the State agency which will allow verification of the monthly report.At a minimum, such documentation shall include documents supporting couponshipments, transfers, issuances, and destruction.(iii) For those State agencies which use an authorization document issuancesystem, coupon issuers shall submit transacted authorization documentsbatched according to each day's activity in accordance with a scheduleprescribed by the State agency, but not less often than monthly.(iv) All mail issuance activity, including the value of mail issuance replacements,shall be reported. Original allotments (first benefits issued for a particularmonth to an ongoing household) subsequently recovered by the issuance officeduring the current month shall be returned to inventory and noted on themail issuance log. When the original allotment is returned to inventoryand the replacement issuance is issued during the current month (monthin which original benefits were issued), the ``replacement'' shall notbe reported.(v) The Form <T3>FNS-250 </T3>shall be reviewed by the State agency for accuracy, completenessand reasonableness. The State agency shall attest to the accuracy of thesereports and shall submit the reports so they will be received by FNS bythe 45th day after the report month. Any revisions to the Form <T3>FNS-250 </T3>for a given month shall be submitted to FNS within 105days after the end of the report month.(vi) FNS shall review each form, submitted through the State agency, forcompleteness, accuracy and reasonableness and shall reconcile inventorywith shipping records, and shall review State agency verification of couponissuer and bulk storage point monthly reports. FNS may supplement the abovereviews by unannounced spot checks of inventory levels and coupon securityarrangements at coupon issuers and at bulk storage points.(2) Form <T3>FNS-46, </T3>Issuance Reconciliation Report, shall be submitted byeach State agency operating an issuance system. The report shall be preparedat the level of the State agency where the actual reconciliation of therecord-for-issuance and master issuance file occurs.(i) The State agency shall identify and report the number and value ofall issuances which do not reconcile with the record-for-issuance and/ormaster issuance file. All unreconciled issuances shall be identified asspecified on this reporting document.(ii) The final report shall be received by FNS no later than 90 days followingthe end of the report month.(3) Form <T3>FNS-259, </T3>Food Stamp Mail Issuance Report.(i) Form <T3>FNS-259 </T3>reports shall be submitted by State agencies for eachunit using a mail issuance system as specified in the Mail Issuance LossReporting Plan required in andSection; 272.2(d)(1)(iv).

This statement shall not be requiredif the reason for the replacement is that the original authorization documentor coupons were improperly manufactured or mutilated, or if the originalissuance has already been returned. The required statement may be mailedto the State agency if the household member is unable to come into theoffice because of age, handicap or distance from the office and is unableto appoint an authorized representative. (2) If the signed statement or affidavit is not received by the State agencywithin 10 days of the date of report, no replacement shall be made.

(ii) If the household has already been issued the maximum allowable numberof countable replacements, subsequent replacements shall be delayed untilthe agency has verified that the original issuance was returned or theoriginal authorization document was not transacted. In a system using authorizationdocuments, due to the time it takes to post and reconcile all authorizationdocuments, it may not be known at the time of the replacement request whetherprior replacements are countable replacements and, therefore, whether thehousehold has reached its limit. In such cases, the allotment shall berestored when the State agency verifies that the limit on countable replacementshas not been reached. (iii) The State agency shall deny or delay replacement issuances in casesin which available documentation indicates that the household's requestfor replacement appears to be fraudulent.

This includes determining whether the original issuancehas been returned to the State agency and, in a system utilizing authorizationdocuments, whether the original authorization document has been transactedand, if so, whether the recipient's signature on the authorization documentmatches the signature on the ID card. In a Photo ID area, the State agencyshall determine if the ID serial number annotated on the authorizationdocument matches the serial number on the recipient's ID card; (3) Issue a replacement in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c) and (d)of this section if the household is eligible; (4) Place the household on an alternate delivery system, if warranted,in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section; and (5) Take other action, such as correcting the address on the master issuancefile, warranted by the reported nondelivery. (f) <T3>Replacing issuances after receipt by the household. </T3>Upon receivinga request for replacement of an issuance reported as stolen or destroyedafter receipt by the household, the State agency shall determine if theissuance was validly issued. The State agency shall also comply with allapplicable provisions in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, aswell as the following procedures for each type of replacement: (1) Prior to replacing an authorization document which was reported stolenafter receipt by the household, the State agency shall determine, to theextent possible, the validity of the request for replacement. For example,the State agency may determine whether the original authorization documenthas been transacted and, if so, whether the signature on the original authorizationdocument matches that on the household statement. In a Photo ID or serializedarea, the State agency shall determine if the ID serial number annotatedon the authorization document matches the serial number on the recipient'sID card. Any replacement which results in duplicate participation shallbe considered a household error, and the replacement countable, when theID serial number shown on the authorization document matches the serialnumber on the recipient's card, unless the ID card was reported lost orstolen prior to the replacement. The State agency may require households,on a case-by-case basis, to report the theft to a law enforcement agencyand to provide verification of such report. (2) Prior to replacing destroyed coupons or authorization documents, ordestroyed food that was purchased with food stamp benefits, the State agencyshall determine that the destruction occurred in a household misfortuneor disaster, such as, but not limited to, a fire or flood. This shall beverified through a collateral contact, documentation from a community agencyincluding, but not limited to, the fire department or the Red Cross, ora home visit. The State agency shall provide replacements of coupons, authorizationdocuments, and/or food in the actual amount of the loss, but not exceedingone month's allotment, unless the exception in paragraph (b)(3) of thissection, applies. (3) Households cannot receive a replacement for coupons lost or stolenafter receipt. (4) The State agency shall provide replacements for improperly manufacturedor mutilated coupons or authorization documents as follows: (i) Coupons received by a household, and subsequently mutilated or foundto be improperly manufactured shall be replaced in the amount of the lossto the household. State agencies shall replace mutilated coupons when three-fifthsof a coupon is presented by the household. The State agency shall examinethe improperly manufactured or mutilated coupons to determine the validityof the claim and the amount of coupons to be replaced. If the State agencycan determine the value of the improperly manufactured or mutilated coupons,the State agency shall replace the unusable coupons in a dollar-for-dollarexchange. After exchanging the coupons and completing a Form <T3>FNS-135, </T3>Affidavit of Return or Exchange of Food Coupons, theState agency shall destroy the coupons in accordance with the procedurescontained in andSection; 274.7(f). If the State agency cannot determine thevalue of the improperly manufactured or mutilated coupons, the State agencyshall cancel the coupons by writing or stamping ``canceled'' across theface of the coupons and forward the coupons to FNS for a determinationof the value by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing.(ii) Authorization documents received by a household and subsequently mutilatedor found to be improperly manufactured shall be replaced only if they areidentifiable. ``Identifiable'' means that the State agency is able to determinethe amount of the issuance and that the authorization document was validlyissued to the household within the last 30 days. For example, if the authorizationdocument serial number is legible, the State agency can determine fromthe record-for-issuance or manual authorization document log to which householdthe authorization document was issued, the date of issuance, and the amount.Similarly, if the case number and validity period are legible, the Stateagency may be able to determine to whom the authorization document wasissued and the amount. If more than one authorization document was issuedto the household and the State agency cannot determine which authorizationdocument was mutilated, the replacement shall be issued in the lesser amount.Improperly manufactured or mutilated authorization documents shall be surrenderedto the State agency.(g) <T3>Alternate issuance system for a household. </T3>The State agency shalloffer to place a household in an alternate issuance system after the firstreport of nonreceipt, or when circumstances exist that indicate that thehousehold may not receive its benefits through the normal issuance system,such as when a household has a history of reported nonreceipt of ATP's.After two requests for replacement of original or replacement ATP's reportedas nondelivered in a six-month period, the State agency shall issue benefitsto that household under an alternate issuance system. The two requestsmay be for either an original or a replacement ATP. The State agency shallkeep the household on the alternate issuance system for the length of timethe State agency determines to be necessary. The State agency may returnthe household to the regular issuance system if the State agency findsthat the circumstances leading to the loss have changed and the risk ofloss has lessened. The placement of a household on an alternate issuancesystem and the length of time the household is on this system is not subjectto the fair hearing process.(h) <T3>Documentation and reconciliation of replacement issuances. </T3>(1)The State agency shall document in the household's case file each requestfor replacement, the date, the reason, and whether or not the replacementwas provided. This information may be recorded exclusively on the householdstatement required in paragraph (c) of this section.(2) The State agency shall maintain, in readily-identifiable form, a recordof the replacements granted to the household, the reason, the month, andwhether the replacement was countable as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)of this section. The record may be a case action sheet maintained in thecase file, notations on the master issuance file, if readily accessible,or a document maintained solely for this purpose. At a minimum, the systemshall be able to identify and differentiate among:(i) Authorization documents or coupons not received in, or stolen from,the mail, and authorization documents stolen after receipt; and(ii) Replacement issuances which are not subject to a replacement limit.(3) Upon completion of reconciliation in a system utilizing authorizationdocuments, the State agency shall update the record required in paragraph(h)(2) of this section to indicate whether both the original and replacementauthorization documents were transacted. If both were not transacted, therecord shall clearly indicate that the replacement authorization documentwas not a countable replacement.(4) When a request for replacement is made late in an issuance month, thereplacement will be issued in a month subsequent to the month in whichthe original authorization document was issued. All replacements shallbe posted and reconciled to the month of issuance of the replacement andmay be posted to the month of issuance of the original authorization document,so that all duplicate transactions may be identified.(i) <T3>Further action on replacement issuances. </T3>The State agency shalltake the following further actions on replacements:(1) On at least a monthly basis, the State agency shall report to the appropriateoffice of the Postal Inspection Service all authorization documents reportedas stolen or lost in the mail.
