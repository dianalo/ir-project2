The Tahoe Savings andamp; Loan Association, South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was closed and nearly all of its assets and deposits were transferred to a newly chartered institution to be run by federal regulators. The bank board said it took the action because the thrift was insolvent.    The thrift's &quot;primary and continuing problem has been its high level of assets, including time sharing developments, that are nearly nonearning or not generating sufficient income to cover expenses,&quot; the Bank Board said. At the end of 1986, nonearning assets of the thrift totaled almost $20 million, or 22% of the thrift's $84.4 million in assets, the bank board said. In addition, the board's statement said the association violated the board's limits on the amount of loans that can be made to a single borrower.    Tahoe was a state-chartered association with eight offices. The Bank Board appointed a five-member board for the new institution, which will reopen today under the same name. The Bank Board also approved a management contract with First Federal Savings andamp; Loan of Reno, Nevada, to manage the new association. </TEXT></DOC>
