 Fortunately forthis AI-rooted technology, firms are shifting their approach to businesssolutions from one of data management to &quot;knowledge management.&quot;andP;  This playsinto the hands of suppliers of expert system tools, because the productsoffer advantages over procedural languages in representing knowledge.andM;&quot;The stress is to make the applications an integral part of the business,&quot;said Tom Kehler, CEO, IntelliCorp, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;Betterbusiness means better customer service, selling, manufacturing andmarketing.&quot;andM;Pioneers like AICorp, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; Aion Corporation, Palo Alto,Calif.; IntelliCorp; Inference Corporation, El Segundo, Calif., and NeuronData, Palo Alto, Calif., brought knowledge-based solutions to the applicationmarketplace.andP;  Along with their customers, the vendors now face the difficultchallenge of integrating their tools with existing databases.andP;  According toJohn Price, director of Application and Customer Support for Neuron Data,&quot;Today's expert systems must be hardware, operating system, language anddatabase independent while providing friendly user interfaces.&quot;andM;The argument runs like this: The more useful the corporate database, the morework will be accomplished.andP;  The more automated and easier to use a system,the less work end users will have to do.andP;  This extends expert systems usebeyond data management, to the management of the business objects thatcomprise this corporate knowledge base.andM;Knowledge management is defined as the science of understanding therelationships of the data, identifying and documenting the rules for managingthe data, and assuring that the data is accurate and maintains integrity.andP;  Inother words, knowledge management is understanding how the enterprise works.andM;The base for that understanding can be actual business policies, rules orguidelines.andP;  A basis for descriptive programming emerges through the model ofobject representation because the corporation's object base is modeled afterthe real world.andP;  Building the model is a difficult, complex task butfortunately, like a foundation, it is built only once.andM;Managing knowledge is a high-level corporate concern.andP;  Management wants toknow how to run and manage a business using rules and guidelines to referenceeverything from marketing to manufacturing.andP;  Expert systems provide theability to insulate the business knowledge from the technical knowledge.andM;One example is Neuron Data's database bridge.andP;  It provides transparent accessto databases from Oracle Corp., Redwood City, Calif.; Sybase, Inc.,andO;Emeryville, Calif.; Ingres/Ask, Alameda, Calif.; Digital Equipment Corp.,andO;Maynard, Mass.andP;  (Rdb); and IBM (DB2 and SQL/DS).andP;  With this mapping, theexpert application reads an object and is said to be insulated fromtechnicalities of database navigation.andP;  The coexistence of multiple databasemanagement systems on a single processor makes this function even morecritical to application development.andM;Personal computer-based expert systems running under Windows from MicrosoftCorp., Redmond, Wash., and supporting Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), provide aseamless-appearing data transfer within a client/server environment.andP;  Dynamicdatabase mapping includes:andM;* mapping of database tables into class objects, database columns to objectbase slots and database rows to object base instances; andandM;* dynamic creation of instances at runtime.andM;&quot;Expert systems provide a logical data bus to move and massage the datathrough the rules which function as filters,&quot; said Neuron Data's Price.andP;  Theexpert methodology links the logical object model with physical databases.andO;These expert systems can run on either a remote guest server or themainframe, which functions as a superserver.andP;  This approach leverages thecorporation's existing investment in data and database management systems.andM;Business-oriented solutions are moving further away from being only numbers,character strings and dates.andP;  By achieving disassociation from data,developers using expert systems can concentrate on the business, usingfree-form logic.andP;  That provides a way to describe an application in businessterms without worrying about the syntax restrictions that bind standarddevelopment.andM;Applications appear to stand alone with transparent integration to LAN-baseddata, databases and other PC-, workstation- and mainframe-based applications.andO;Any single application has the capability of accessing any or all of thesedata sources.andM;While looking simple to the front-end user, four main technical complexitiesoperate behind the scenes.andP;  The key technologies that provide the expertfoundation are:andM;* Establishment of business rules, procedures and methods.andM;* Object-oriented programming with a rule integrated language.andM;* Dynamic graphic images representing the information.andM;* Tools that provide sufficient power to integrate the data, whether itresides on database, flat-files, Vsam, etc., mapping the data into objects.andM;Supported by distributed systems, corporations are rapidly expanding theirbusiness and informational needs on a national and worldwide basis.andP;  Thisintegration hurdle must be addressed in providing query capabilities atremote locations.andP;  Heterogeneous hardware and software must be seamlesslyinterfaced to be user-transparent.andM;The traditional applications development philosophy, where the businessproblem is interpreted as a data solution, must be reviewed.andP;  The translationof the business model into procedural code is incomprehensible and difficultto maintain.andP;  With expert systems, the solutions are independent of the dataconcerns.andP;  The process model is the organizational model, and the solutionsare described as object-oriented and rule-based rather than data-based.andM;Other significant advances are being made in user interface and data storageand retrieval technology.andP;  By having the process component completelyindependent from the data model, each division can concentrate on thediscipline that is most critical to the area where they are the technical&quot;experts.&quot;andM;By modeling real-world solutions as objects, expert systems impose on dataefficiency and consistency.andP;  The inheritance features of such expert toolssupply slots with values, methods and options that are in conformance withestablished policies and regulations of the organization.andP;  By mapping objectbases to relational databases, the data access system permits utilization ofcorporate data in applications for the database systems to process alone.andM;The databases can be employed for the storage and security features, whichare their known strength, while overcoming their lack of flexibility.andM;RESPONDING TO TODAY'S NEEDSandM;Traditional knowledge-based systems, which were compiled, were static andcould not keep up with the real world.andP;  The interpreted knowledge-basedsystems typically were known to be high-resource consumers and ran veryslowly.andP;  The more recent knowledge-based products respond to today's highlyfluid, interactive business world.andP;  Virtually everything is doneautomatically, including data access and database mapping.andP;  Existingapplications in conventional languages can incorporate knowledge-basedmodules.andM;The OS/2 operating system's support for multiple applications, andtransaction threads operating concurrently, helps to supportresource-intensive expert system tools and applications.andP;  This is welcomenews for IBM, which has been listening to complaints of a software shortagefor that environment.andP;  This expert support at the workstation and personalcomputer level serves as a catalyst for the migration from the currenthost-centered information system architectures to a client-server orcooperative processing architecture.andM;On the other hand, &quot;many companies are seriously looking into Unix because ofits open architecture and portability,&quot; said IntelliCorp's Kehler.andP;  &quot;Unix isbecoming a popular operating system for expert systems because of increasingindustry-wide acceptance and introduction of new and innovative tools.&quot;andM;Unix supports the ability to insulate the logical application from thephysical location of the data.andP;  Expert systems provide the ability for thosemanaging the business to also manage the knowledge of the business from theirlocations.andM;Specialized applications can be developed for remote locations, specifyingtheir needs while retaining corporate-wide standardization for platform anddata structure.andP;  Neuron Data's Price added, &quot;In the future, the mainframewill become a large server with the intelligence moving as close as possibleto the user interface.&quot;andP;  This architecture promotes application flexibility.andM;Ingres Corp. addresses efficiency in another manner by placing the rules inthe database, where they are as close to the data as possible.andP;  In December1989, Ingres announced its Intelligent Database, composed of ObjectManagement and Knowledge Management modules.andP;  These components put thebusiness policies in the form of expert rules in the data dictionary, locatedin the server.andM;&quot;It is a database approach to rule management,&quot; said Dave Kellogg, productmanager for Ingres.andP;  &quot;The rules are managed like data is managed in anobject-oriented manner.&quot;andM;Ingres, realizing the potential overhead associated with this move, placedsome perfomrance and integrity enhancements into release 6 of theirclient/multiserver architecture.andP;  There is an I/O reduction technique, onlinebackup, two-phase commit and query optimizer that finds the quickest way toexecute a query.andP;  &quot;What-if&quot; scenarios are only limited by forward chaining.andM;Knowledge-based methodoligies are being integrated into applications likeMAC-PAC from Andersen Consulting, Chicago.andP;  Their expert configuration toolfacilitates customer sales order entry, pricing and manufacturing.andP;  E. KipFriedli, product executive, described it best as &quot;[capturing] the knowledgeof a few people so that it can be used effectively by many.&quot;andP;  This expertknowledge becomes even more valued in highly technical disciplines such asdatabase modeling and design.andM;Bachman Information Systems, Inc., Burlington, Mass., provides two such toolsthat embed that company's expertise into modeling (Bachman/Analyst, anenhanced version of Bachman/Data Analyst) and design (Bachman/DBA (DB2)).andO;According to Chris Gane, principle consultant for Bachman, these productscarry intelligence one step further, allowing the user to select the level ofautomation.andM;The lowest level of interaction serves as an online tutorial.andP;  The system notonly makes the decisions but explains why those decisions were made.andP;  On theother end of the spectrum, it will prompt for options and directions as itprogresses, providing a more customized solution.andM;Chris Loosley, Bachman Fellow, sees the future complexity of databasestructures requiring support by expert technology that will monitor factorssuch as growth, deletions, retrievals, peak activity times, frequency ofreorganizations and fields.andP;  He envisions a tool recommending a course ofaction to the database administrator.andM;The explosive growth of demands will soon, if it has not already, overwhelmthe systems staff supporting this effort.andP;  Expert technology will fill thevoid in skilled professionals required in the explaining area of DB2-basedapplication development.andM;Until recently, expert systems were tools for applications and end users.andO;Now, the entire information organization can utilize expert systemtechnology.andM;Many issues are driving this movement: the complexity of data and resourcemanagement, a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week data center, and a potential &quot;lightsout&quot; environment.andM;Union Bank in switzerland, a large Unisys complex, applies IntelliCorp'sKnowledge Engineering Environment (KEE) as an object-based system to manageits operations environment.andP;  The bank's &quot;business model&quot; represents itsbusiness fo the data center.andP;  The knowledge-based system maintains the&quot;network&quot; of applications that must run.andM;BRIDGING THE GAPandM;The application dimension of Sy stemView, IBM's framework for systemsmanagement, defines the guidelines for implementing and integrating systemmanagement applications.andP;  It bridges the gap between today's partiallyintegrated systems management applications and tomorrow's standards.andP;  Experttechnology supports the tools involved with business management, changemanagement, configuration management, operations management, performancemanagement and problem management.andM;&quot;I believe they [expert systems in systems-level software] will be crucial ingetting to a full implementation of SystemView,&quot; said Robert Sackett, productmanager for Candle Corporation, Los Angeles.andP;  Managing a Sysplexconfiguration will require an incident manager and workload balancing.andM;Tim Dreisbach, general manager, Systems Productivity Division at LegentCorporation, Vienna, Va., is optimistic about the future integration ofexpert solutions in data and resource management.andP;  He said, &quot;We will seeexpert logic supporting the communication and execution of automationproducts through a relational data framework.andP;  This will automate thefunctions of the operations staff, help desk and performance staff.&quot;andM;Dreisbach added, &quot;With the complexity of software interfaces, an enterprisesoftware configurator [similar to a hardware configurator] is on thehorizon.&quot;andM;Fred Lizza, VP of marketing for AICorp, said delivery of knowledge-basedproducts will be on a step-by-step basis.andP;  The first phase will consist ofproducts that diagnose problems by measuring, monitoring and capturing theinformation.andP;  This is extremely useful for firms that supply support andconsulting expertise.andP;  It gives them a mechanism for packaging and deliveirngthis expertise firsthand without being in constant telephone communiction oron-site.andM;&quot;The key belief is that the customer [or end-user] can modify the rules in astructured way,&quot; said Randy Raynor, senior vice president of Inference.andP;  Hebelieves this is one of the strong points of integrating expert technology.andM;For some expert systems in their &quot;native&quot; mode, there are tools available toextend the end-user rule maintenance, by locking or protecting selected ruleswhile allowing other rules to be updated or bypassed.andP;  The integration ofexpert systems with current products is still an immature technology.andP;  Eachvendor has taken steps (in their own direction).andP;  Goal Systems is keeping thetechnology external, while Boole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif., Candle andLegent, are embedding it.andP;  In view of Raynor's statement, the future willprovide a combination of both.andM;Vendors are closely watching customer reactions to measure the acceptance ofthis technology.andP;  Future phases will introduce more proactive tools andcomponents that will actually take the recommended or corrective actionsindependent of human intervention wherever appropriate.andP;  Lizza said, &quot;Themarket has progressed to the point where the capabilities of experttechnology are understood and valued.andP;  It is becoming a viable way to go.&quot;andM;Jim Hayes, senior systems programmer, technical support for HuntingtonNational Bank, Columbus, Ohio, said, &quot;today's expert systems have learned howto read the book.andP;  The next step will be for them to write the book.&quot;andP;  Byexpert systems learning and building their knowledge base from experience,each organization will automatically configure and update its rules from itsown dynamic environment.andP;  Each system will build, monitor and maintain itselfautomatically.andM;Expert technology has progressed to the point where major independentsoftware vendors plan to incorporate it in future products.andP;  Informationservices will see an evolution from the reactive to the proactive.andP;  Insteadof just identifying problems and recommending solutions and how to implementthose solutions, future expert systems will predict and prevent problemswithin a heterogeneous software environment.andM;Strapko is a senior consultant working with International Data Corporation,Framingham, Mass.andP;  He has 20 years experience in information servicesspanning applications development, database and data center.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
