Hillsdale Blvd., Suite260, Foster City, Calif.andP;  94404; (415) 349-4664.andM;ScrapbookPlus 2.1 is the first indispensable utility program for Windows 3.0.andO;It has no equivalent in the character-based DOS world, but it performsfunctions that every Windows 3.0 user will find immensely beneficial.andM;Essentially, Eikon Systems' ScrapbookPlus is an extension to Windows'Clipboard.andP;  Like the Clipboard, it stores images and text copied or cut fromWindows documents.andP;  Unlike the Clipboard, however, it provides half a dozenways to manipulate, catalogue and translate images and text.andM;ScrapbookPlus also leverages the underused power of the Clipboard.andP;  When youcopy a range of cells in an Excel worksheet, for example, Excel may place asmany as 15 different copies of that range on the Clipboard in variousformats, extending from a bitmapped image of how the cells look in Excel toplain text, DIF (data interchange format) and CSV (comma separated values).andO;This lets you paste the copied range into a variety of differentapplications, according to the format expected by the &quot;receiving&quot; applicationyou select.andP;  Paintbrush, for example, would receive a bitmap, Write wouldreceive text, Superbase would receive CSV data and so on.andM;Copying multiple formats to the Clipboard and selecting the most appropriateformat for pasting occur automatically whenever you copy or paste data inWindows.andP;  But there are times when it would help to be able to intervene andmanually determine which format is used or to be able to convert the copieddata to one of the formats found on the Clipboard.andM;Windows' Clipboard doesn't let you do this.andP;  And it holds only the contentsof your last cut or copy operation.andP;  To preserve the contents of more thanone operation, you must save each as a separate file in Clipboard's CLPformat.andM;ScrapbookPlus addresses both shortcomings.andP;  In its basic capacity, it storestext and images from other Windows applications.andP;  Each ScrapbookPlus fileholds up to 4,500 items that can be viewed at full size or as a thumbnailsketch (with up to 42 thumbnails visible on a standard-size screen).andP;  You canattach a 99-character description to each item and search for items accordingto description or format.andP;  The utility is an ideal repository for boilerplatetext or for a library of graphics images.andP;  If you have a directory filledwith 300 PCX files and don't have this utility, it can be maddeninglydifficult to find the image you want.andP;  Import those files into ScrapbookPlus,you'll find what you need in a few minutes with a thumbnail view.andM;ScrapbookPlus recognizes PCX, MSP, EPS, TIFF, CGM, DRW, WMF and Windows 2.0BMP graphics formats, as well as TXT, RTF, CSV and DIF text formats.andP;  It canstore images or text in custom application-specific formats, although itcan't display or translate those formats.andP;  Once an image or text item ispasted into ScrapbookPlus, you can view it or export it to disk in any formatthe utility supports.andM;You can paste images or text to a ScrapbookPlus file by explicitly pastingthem or by activating the AutoPaste command.andP;  With the latter method, text orgraphics cut or copied from any Windows application are automatically pastedinto the ScrapbookPlus file.andP;  ScrapbookPlus's Camera tool can capture&quot;snapshots&quot; of all or part of the screen to paste into the file.andP;  You canalso import files in any format ScrapbookPlus supports.andM;AutoPaste is invaluable in all kinds of situations.andP;  For instance, activateAutoPaste instead of your communication program's session log while you'rescanning an online directory or reading messages in an online forum.andP;  Whenyou want to keep something for future reference, simply highlight the itemand copy it.andP;  It's much easier to find the item you want later from yourScrapbookPlus file than from a logged transcript of your entire onlinesession.andM;You won't soon run out of ways to make use of this powerful, multifacetedprogram.andP;  ScrapbookPlus will be standard equipment for Windows 3.0 users.andM;ScrapbookPlus is the first must-have Clipboard and file conversion utilityfor Windows 3.0 users.andM;SCRAPBOOKPLUS 2.1, $149.95.andP;  Eikon Systems, 989 E.
