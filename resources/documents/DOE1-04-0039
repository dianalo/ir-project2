MR spectroscopy magnetizationtransfer method for detection of lactate in ischemic tissue in the presenceof interfering fat proton resonances. Pyruvate is magnetically labeledwith a saturation pulse and, when converted to lactate, the lactate retainsthe label. Difference spectra obtained with and without a saturationpulse contain no fat resonances. High-resolution spectra (determinedwith a GE 1.5-T Signa) of low lactate levels were obtained by water suppression(a factor of -- 12,000) using a 1 3 3 1 pulse and section-selective gradients.Pyruvate-lactate saturation transfer techniques should find wide applicabilityin the study of ischemia.</TEXT></DOC>
