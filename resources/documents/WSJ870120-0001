During Tokyo trading, the dollar fell to a post-World War II low of 149.98 Japanese yen -- the first time the currency has traded below 150 yen -- as spot volume reached a record $10.19 billion. The dollar's previous low, 152.55 yen, was set last August.    The currency later recovered somewhat as speculators repurchased dollars sold earlier at higher levels. By late London trading, as volume dwindled because of the U.S. holiday, the dollar stood at 150.80 yen, down 1.6% from 153.20 late Friday in New York. The dollar also plummeted 1.8% to 1.8080 West German marks, from 1.8405 Friday. The British pound climbed 1%, to $1.5340 from $1.5191.    Major U.S. banks were closed to mark the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr.    In mid-morning trading in Asia Tuesday, the dollar strengthened to 1.8220 marks and 151.95 yen.    Amid the dollar's steep fall, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced at a news conference in Japan early Tuesday that he would come to Washington tomorrow to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker.    Yesterday's movement &quot;all really happened before we arrived this morning,&quot; said Geoffrey Dennis, a monetary economist at the brokerage firm James Capel andamp; Co., London. &quot;There's really nothing new to say. There's still enormous bearish speculation against the dollar, and barely any fundamental support for a rally,&quot; he added.    In Tokyo, dealers said Japan's central bank intervened to support the dollar during trading, buying between $1 billion and $2 billion. In the past two weeks, the Bank of Japan has opposed the dollar's decline by buying several billion dollars in currency markets.    Weighing heavily on the dollar yesterday was a report in Newsweek magazine that reached newsstands early in the Tokyo day. The magazine quoted unidentified Treasury officials as saying that they consider 140 yen an appropriate level for the dollar.    A Treasury official denied the report and said that &quot;we haven't discussed any specific targets.&quot; The White House also has denied that it has any target level for the dollar. Nonetheless, currency speculators generally believe otherwise.    The dollar plunged last week after the New York Times reported that administration officials want a lower dollar to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. It recovered somewhat on Thursday and Friday before resuming its decline yesterday.    &quot;I think they're looking for further declines in the dollar to make up for the excessive overvaluation of the dollar in 1985,&quot; said Mr. Dennis of James Capel andamp; Co.    The dollar also was hurt by a weekend report that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the U.S. wants the dollar to fall to around 120 to 125 yen.    The dollar's plunge results from the confluence of U.S. political pressure for a weaker currency -- both that perceived by traders and that from actual statements by some politicians -- slow economic growth in the U.S. and a persistent trade deficit.    &quot;Everyone is looking for excuses to knock the dollar down,&quot; said Peter J. Becket, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.    There were widespread rumors yesterday that there soon will be a meeting of finance officials of the so-called Group of Five -- the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany and France. There also was speculation about possible talks between West Germany and Japan aimed at coordinating measures to support the dollar.    Mr. Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister, said West German government officials approached Japan to explore the possibility of holding currency discussions, but he added that nothing in detail was decided. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told a news conference in Bonn that no date has been set for any currency discussions with Japan.    Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's governor, Satoshi Sumita, repeated his determination to continue intervening in support of the dollar.    Mr. Becket of Canadian Imperial Bank said that &quot;there's a bit of nervousness&quot; among traders concerning the possibility of a West German-Japanese meeting on exchange rates. He also expressed skepticism about that possibility, saying, &quot;We've heard that since {the dollar fell to} 2.00 {marks}, haven't we?&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery climbed $6.10 an ounce, to $422.40, in moderate trading. Volume was estimated at 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $419.05 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           London     Home Mkt.
