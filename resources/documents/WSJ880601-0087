The ruling by U.S. District Judge Alan Bloch allows the company and a group of dissident shareholders to continue their proxy fight for control of the company's 13-member board.    A group of equity holders, led by dissident Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg, a New York brokerage firm, has nominated seven directors to the board in an effort to gain a say in Allegheny's reorganization plan. The Pittsburgh-based consumer products concern filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in February and is expected to submit its reorganization plan by June 30.    Allegheny had originally scheduled its annual meeting for May 20. It was postponed for 90 days by a federal bankruptcy judge after a group of unsecured creditors argued that a proxy fight would be expensive and divert management's attention from developing a reorganization plan. The unsecured creditors said they were appealing the new meeting date. </TEXT></DOC>
