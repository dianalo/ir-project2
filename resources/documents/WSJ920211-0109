Such was the clear conclusion of theaftermath of the men's downhill, the first and showcase eventof the Olympic Alpine skiing card.   There was the winner, Patrick Ortlieb of Austria, sayinghe hoped he -- and, by extension, any fellow ace -- wouldnever have to race the darned thing again. &quot;It was notspectacular enough -- too slow,&quot; said the blunt-chinned,blunt-spoken young man of 24. &quot;You didn't have to overcomeyour inhibitions to succeed.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   And there was the second-place finisher -- the French heroFrank Piccard -- saying that the layout was &quot;the future ofAlpine skiing . . . something that's good for the image ofour sport.&quot; He added: &quot;It required some technical knowledgefrom Patrick to win. Yes, it was the skier, not the ski.&quot;   That last bit of business echoed a question that had beenbouncing around the Alps since old-Olympian Jean-ClaudeKilly, France's resident sports hero, undertook to buildsomething different in a downhill run for these Winter Games.He and designer Bernhard Russi, another former Olympic goldmedalist, applied some dynamite to the slope below a9,200-foot peak above Killy's gloriously scenic hometown andbuilt a course for the well-turned skier, or, moreaccurately, the skier who turns well.   Their curvy run contrasted with the wider, straighter onesthat had hosted the men's downhill in recent Olympics past,runs that, it was alleged, gave undo advantage tolesser-skilled types who had an edge in the equipmentdepartment. Why, an American -- the brash-mouthed BillyJohnson -- won the race at Sarajevo in 1984] Thus, the&quot;skier, not the ski&quot; controversy, the type on which allOlympia thrives.   I feel it must be reported, however, that the brouhaha wasthe kind that engages mostly experts, like that one about thenumber of angels who can boogie on the head of a pin. Fromwhere I stood -- at the bottom of the thing, looking up anincline that averages 55 degrees and drops 3,100 feet in 13/4 miles -- it looked plenty fast and scary enough. If youwere not a quite-good skier, you'd need a parachute to getdown.   And, indeed, the course -- dubbed &quot;La Face de Bellevarde&quot;-- provided spills enough to satisfy the stock-car racingfans among those who lined its slopes last week. On Saturday,the last day of practice, an unfortunate Canadian tore kneeligaments in a crash, and in the event proper, eight of the56 entrants ended their runs horizontally.   Their number included some pretty fair hands, includingLeonard Stock of Austria, the 1980 gold medalist. NilsLinneberg, a Chilean, needed a sleigh to get down after atumble, and Alphonse Gomis, a Senegalese, covered more groundwithout his skis than with them (but only his pride was hurt,according to the press office here).   And the blond-haired Mr. Ortlieb, who won the gold,laughed that he'd keep his medal despite his poor opinion ofthe handy-work of Messieurs Killy and Russi. Even though Mr.Ortlieb came here ranked among the top few downhillers, andlists his hometown as Lech, a resort hamlet that now has fourOlympic Alpine gold medalists among its handful of natives,he'd never won a World Cup event, and has plenty of room inhis medal cabinet.   Mr. Ortlieb not only finished first, he started there, theresult of a starting-position draw among the 15 skiers rankedbest coming in. He later said that although he was &quot;full oftension&quot; waiting to see whether anyone would beat his time of1:50.37, he liked his No. 1 post position fine.   &quot;Not knowing what others had done put less pressure onme,&quot; he declared. And besides, &quot;No. 1 is my favorite number.&quot;(Isn't it everyone's?)   &quot;Was my victory a surprise?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Maybe to some,but not so much to me. Not much separates the best dozen or15 men.&quot;   The &quot;not much&quot; margin between first and second placesamounted to 0.05 second, and the same difference separatedsecond and third. That Mr. Piccard, from the nearby town ofLes Saisies, was the runner-up, over Austrian Gunther Mader,also was something of a surprise. It wasn't that Mr. Piccardlacked big-time credentials -- he'd won a bronze medal in theevent in the 1988 Games at Calgary and a gold there in theSuper G, a sort of downhill-slalom combination -- but becauseof a recent slump that had the French sporting press buzzingabout the state of his psyche.   Mr. Piccard swooped down the mountain with his countrymenstamping and hoo-hooing and his time-clock fractions thewee-ist bit behind Mr. Ortlieb's because of a slower start hecouldn't quite make up. And no, he said later in answer to aquery, Mr. Piccard had not consulted a psychiatrist about hislowly (for him) 23rd-place previous ranking in the event.He'd just been skiing too much, and a pre-Olympic rest curedthat.   Among the Americans, A.J. Kitt, a 23-year-old fromRochester, N.Y., did best, finishing ninth. Earlier thisseason he'd won a World Cup downhill event, something noAmerican had done for seven years, thus raising U.S. Olympichopes. But before the race he'd opined that the twists andturns of &quot;La Face&quot; might put a crimp in his flats-lovingstyle, and his showing proved it.   Mr. Kitt later said he was neither pleased nordisappointed with his showing, and that he'd try not to letit spoil the rest of his life. He might have added that ninthplace was a heckuva lot better than the best American finishin the event at Calgary, which was 26th.   It is further worth noting, I think, that of the 37 medalsawarded in the Olympic men's downhill since the event wasinaugurated in 1948 (there was a tie for the bronze thatfirst year), 31 have been won by the Austrians, Swiss orFrench. In other words, its halps to be from the Alps,whatever the course.</TEXT></DOC>
