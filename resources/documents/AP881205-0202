Nakasone, who is no longer in office, later apologized to theAmericans, but his remark implicitly denied the existence of Japan'sown minority groups _ chiefly, the outcast Burakumin, the indigenousAinus and ethnic Koreans.   Human rights activists claim those groups along with someforeigners living in Japan are victimized by social attitudes andpractices that discriminate against people outside the mainstream ofsociety.   The activists hope to raise an awareness among 122 millionJapanese of the plight of Japan's own minorities with meetings andrallies in conjunction with the 40th anniversary Dec. 10 of theUnited Nations Declaration of Human Rights.   A U.S. State Department report said in February that Burakumin,Ainus and Koreans all face ``entrenched social prejudice.''   ``Although the Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas,'' thereport added, ``the citizens of this densely populated nation have acultural, ethnic and racial homogeneity which makes them lesswilling to integrate alien residents ... into their society.''   ``The Japanese majority just doesn't pay attention to theseissues,'' says Futaba Igarashi, secretary-general of the DemocraticLawyers of Japan Association.</TEXT><HEAD>THE BURAKUMIN</HEAD><TEXT>   These are descendants of feudal-era outcasts in so-called uncleanprofessions such as hide-tanning and butchering. Centuries ago, theywere designated to live as outcasts in separate villages, or``buraku.'' Prejudice against them was so strong that when maps weredrawn, the buraku were left out.   Although their outcast status was abolished by the government in1871, there are still 6,000 Burakumin communities in Japan,according to the Burakumin Liberation Research Institute, which putstheir population at 3 million _ 2.5 times the government's officialfigure.   Racially identical to other Japanese, the Burakumin are stillperceived to be different.   The unemployment rate for Burakumin is about 10 times higher thanthe general population's rate of 2.6 percent, and they face socialdiscrimination, in part due to Japan's detailed family registrationsystem. The system enables companies to check the background of apotential employee, or a family to check the suitability of apossible spouse.</TEXT><HEAD>THE AINU</HEAD><TEXT>   Like American Indians, the Ainu are an ethnic and racial minorityindigenous to Japan, although most Ainu _ estimates of their numbersrange from 57,000 to 100,000 _ live and speak as Japanese.   The Ainu have presented demands for self-determination at twoUnited Nations conferences, protesting ``wide social and economicgaps between the Ainu people and other Japanese people.''   ``Acts of discrimination against the Ainu people, due to theirethnic origin, continue to persist in schools, places of employment,marriages and other aspects of social life,'' said a statementpresented to the U.N. Human Rights Commission.   In its report to the commission last year, the Japanesegovernment acknowledged for the first time that the Ainus possess adistinctive religion, language and culture, but it maintained thatthey enjoy equal protection under the law.   According to Ainu Association officials, job discrimination iscommon. Only 8.1 percent of Ainu attend university, compared with27.4 percent of all Japanese.</TEXT><HEAD>THE KOREANS</HEAD><TEXT>   At least 670,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of them descendantsof laborers forcibly brought to this country during Japan'scolonization of the Korean peninsula, 1910-45.   Koreans say they continue to face discrimination. Most do not usetheir real names, instead using Japanese names to conceal theiridentity.   Non-naturalized Koreans, including 587,000 first-, second- andthird-generation permanent residents, are considered foreign aliensand are required to carry identification cards.   Other Koreans have taken Japanese nationality, a complicatedprocess that requires them to officially relinquish their Koreannames and identity.   ``Korean students have only half the chance of going intouniversity as majority Japanese,'' said a report by the London-basedMinority Rights Group. ``Since higher education ... is the key toeconomic advancement, this is a serious drawback to Koreanaspirations.''</TEXT><HEAD>THE FOREIGNERS</HEAD><TEXT>   The Civil Liberties Union has approached the United Nations onbehalf of foreign workers _ many of them young women lured to Japanwith a promise of jobs as ``entertainers,'' only to have theirpassports confiscated by their employers and to be forced intoprostitution.   Of the 11,307 foreigners deported for working illegally in Japanin 1987, 62 percent, or 7,010, were women. Ninety-three percentworked as prostitutes, strippers or ``hostesses,'' according to agroup set up to assist foreign women.   In recent years, thousands of South and Southeast Asian men havecome to work in Japan as laborers at construction sites and infactories.   Foreigners working in Japan have nowhere to turn for protection,says lawyer Yaeko Takeoka.   ``Their managers withhold their salaries, but since they areworking illegally, the government says they are criminals and don'thave any rights.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri AMs Dec. 9</NOTE></DOC>
