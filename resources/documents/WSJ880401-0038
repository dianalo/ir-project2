James B. Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg were awarded the prize in explanatory journalism for their coverage of the October stock-market crash and coverage of insider trading on Wall Street.    Walt Bogdanich of the Journal was awarded the prize for specialized reporting for his stories on faulty testing by U.S. medical laboratories.    The Journal, published by Dow Jones andamp; Co., was the only newspaper this year to win two Pulitzer Prizes for reporting and writing. The awards bring to 13 the number of Pulitzers awarded the Journal.    Two other newspapers -- the Charlotte Observer and the Miami Herald -- won two prizes each in various categories. One of the Observer's prizes, for public service, was for articles disclosing misuse of funds by the PTL television ministry.    Other recipients included the Philadelphia Inquirer's Tim Weiner for national reporting for a series on secret government spending for defense and intelligence activities; Thomas L. Friedman of the New York Times for international reporting from Israel; and the Chicago Tribune for investigative reporting for a series on corruption in city government.    Last fall, Mr. Stewart, 36 years old, and Mr. Hertzberg, 42, spent four weeks examining the scope and severity of the stock-market crash and wrote a story entitled &quot;Terrible Tuesday&quot; which broke the news that on Tuesday, Oct. 20, a day after Black Monday, the New York Stock Exchange stopped functioning and came within minutes of closing, imperiling the nation's financial system. The subsequent report of the president's Brady Commission in many respects echoed their story.    &quot;A Dream Gone Wrong,&quot; the second story for which Messrs. Stewart and Hertzberg were honored, chronicled the downfall of former Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. investment banker Martin Siegel. The story showed how the crime of insider trading spread from outsiders like Ivan F. Boesky to the heart of Wall Street's establishment.    &quot;Such stories didn't occur in isolation,&quot; said Journal Managing Editor Norman Pearlstine. &quot;Jim and Dan have consistently broken news on Wall Street's biggest stories: the insider-trading scandal, including the federal investigation of Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and the stock-market crash and its causes. Their work was part of the Journal's broader commitment and unparalleled coverage of Wall Street and the financial markets.&quot;    Walt Bogdanich, 37, wrote a series of stories on faulty testing by medical laboratories, explaining how incompetent management and an excessive concern for profit afflict one segment of the U.S. medical community.    Response to these articles was swift. After one story disclosed how sweatshop conditions in some Pap smear laboratories contributed to shockingly high Pap test error rates, the American Medical Association began an investigation of this cancer test and various government agencies began to study tighter regulation of medical laboratories.    &quot;Walt interviewed more than 500 people for his stories,&quot; Mr. Pearlstine said. &quot;His work reflects the highest reporting standards as well as a personal concern for the public's health and safety.&quot;    Mr. Bogdanich joined the Journal as a reporter in 1984. Before that he worked at the Cleveland Press and Plain Dealer. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and holds a master's degree in journalism from Ohio State University. Mr. Bogdanich has previously received George Polk, Overseas Press Club and Penney-Missouri national journalism awards.    Mr. Stewart came to the Journal in 1983 from American Lawyer magazine where he was executive editor. He is a graduate of DePauw University and Harvard Law School and spent three years as an associate in the New York law firm of Cravath Swaine andamp; Moore.    Mr. Hertzberg joined the Journal in 1977 as a reporter covering the New York City fiscal crisis. Before that he was a reporter for Newsday. Mr. Hertzberg is a graduate of the University of Chicago.    Mr. Stewart and Mr. Hertzberg together won a Gerald Loeb deadline-writing award for their coverage in 1986 of the Boesky insider-trading scandal. Earlier this week they received a George Polk award for their coverage of insider trading and the stock market.
