(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michigan, home of the Big Three automakers,will no longer invest state pension funds in two of the automobilecompanies because they have business ties to South Africa, saidstate Treasurer Robert Bowman.   Bowman said General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are among 172firms from which $5 billion in state pension funds must be withdrawnover the next five years because of a state law restrictinginvestments in companies with ties to South Africa.   ``Ford and GM have both taken large steps in the last few monthsto move closer to disassociating themselves with the Republic ofSouth Africa, but it will indeed curtail our investments both in GMand Ford,'' he said Friday, adding he hopes the law will lead thefirms to change their practices.   ``We are adding our voice, a large voice, to a growing chorus ofthose who say something has got to change over there.''   Bowman said the third automaker, Chrysler Corp., has nooperations in South Africa.   General Motors spokeswoman Karen Longridge said the company wouldhave no comment until Tuesday.   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said the company would not have anyreaction to the state's announcement.   A sponsor of the new law downplayed the impact on the two largeemployers and the state's economy.   ``The fact is by and large those companies have been moving jobsout of Michigan, decreasing employment in this state,'' said Rep.Perry Bullard, D-Ann Arbor, adding that state funds will be freedfor investment in other Michigan firms.   The state currently has $1.25 billion invested in Ford andGeneral Motors which must be sold over the next five years becauseof the law, Bowman said.   In addition to requiring divestiture of current investments, thelaw, which takes effect Sunday, also bans new investments in firmsdoing business in South Africa until the companies drop theirassociations in South Africa or the country ends its apartheidpolicy.   Besides General Motors and Ford, Bowman said Michigan-basedKellogg Co., Unisys and Upjohn Co. are on the list of firms known tohave South African ties, but he said state investments in those aresmall.   Bowman said state officials will urge the companies to endoperations in South Africa.   ``We're not telling them they are doing something evil ormalicious. We're telling them we'd like them to change and untilthey do change, we're not going to be able to invest in them,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
