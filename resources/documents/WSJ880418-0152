Moore (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BTI FGRP </CO><IN> INS TNM </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   B.A.T Industries PLC's chairman said Farmers Group Inc.'s offer to discuss a possible takeover of Farmers contained &quot;unreasonable standstill terms,&quot; possibly ushering in a more acrimonious phase in B.A.T's $4.5 billion bid for Farmers.    Analysts had said the Los Angeles-based insurer's invitation to talk seemed to be Farmers' first sign of flexibility since B.A.T proposed a takeover in January. But Patrick Sheehy, the chairman, said in a letter to Farmers directors that the British tobacco, retailing and financial services concern views the ostensible offer as &quot;a clear attempt to avoid such negotiations.&quot;    A B.A.T spokesman in London said Friday that Farmers insisted that B.A.T refrain from buying Farmers shares until at least 20 days after obtaining regulatory approval for its bid for the company. The British concern is seeking clearance from insurance regulators in nine states.    Mr. Sheehy said in the letter that Farmers' latest actions would discourage B.A.T from sweetening its unsolicited $63-a-share offer.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Farmers' common closed at $62.50 a share, down 62.5 cents, on volume of 1.2 million shares.    After Farmers' board repeatedly rejected B.A.T's requests for meetings, B.A.T began trying to build support among Farmers holders. It now is expected to intensify that effort, especially by soliciting votes for a resolution it plans to present at Farmers' annual meeting May 20. The non-binding resolution calls on Farmers directors to hold &quot;good-faith negotiations&quot; with B.A.T about its offer.    Farmers has acknowledged holding talks with an unidentified party on a possible leveraged buy-out to save it from B.A.T. But a buy-out financed with billions of dollars of debt could create problems for Farmers with insurance regulators, some analysts say.    The recent weakness of U.S. equity markets also could exacerbate pressure on Farmers' management. Risk arbitragers who hold Farmers stock &quot;are looking for a bid of up to $70 a share to turn a profit on their investment,&quot; said Paul Beaufrere, an insurance analyst at London stockbrokers James Capel andamp; Co. &quot;If Farmers doesn't come up with (a higher bid) before May 20, it all could change very quickly in B.A.T's favor,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
