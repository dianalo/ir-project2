Bush, meanwhile, urged Iowa Republicans by telephone fromWashington to help him and underscore the ``enormous differences''he had with Democrat Michael Dukakis.   ``The point is, I believe, if we can do that and do it withintegrity, the American people are going to see the clearest-cutchoice in an election since the McGovern-Nixon race in 1972,'' Bushsaid. ``I think we need this fall to spell it out without tearinghim down personally.''   Bush spoke to the Iowa Republican State Convention in Des Moinesthrough a telephone hookup from the nation's capital.   He dismissed recent polls showing him trailing Dukakis, blaminghis poor showing on getting an early hold on the GOP nomination.Since then ``the Republican message disappeared from the politicalradar screen,'' Bush said.   ``It just makes me realize just how ridiculous polls are inearly June,'' Bush said. ``The message is, don't worry about pollsin early June.''   Robert Teeter, a Detroit-based pollster for the Bush campaign,spoke to a Republican ``Unity'' planning session in Cincinnati,which attracted Republican delegates from 24 states.   He said that while polls still indicate the GOP is runningslightly behind the Democratic Party in popularity, ``the fact is,we are doing a better job attracting the younger people.''   Former GOP presidential hopefuls Pat Robertson, Senate MinorityLeader Robert Dole and Alexander M. Haig Jr., also addressed thesession, saying they would be surrogate speakers for Bush, thecertain Republican nominee.   Teeter credited the baby boom _ people born during thepost-World War II expansion period _ for the increased partymembership. Since the 1984 election, 52 to 54 percent of theRepublican party members have been under age 40, Teeter said.   ``For the first time in 50 years, we are going to compare reallyclose with the Democrats, going into this election,'' Teeter said.   To win, however, Republicans must attract independents and someDemocrats as President Ronald Reagan did in the past two elections,he said.   ``The tax issue is the best issue we have,'' said Lee Atwater,Bush's campaign manager, of the GOP attack on Dukakis, who hasendorsed a $115 million tax hike for his home state ofMassachusetts.   Atwater, branding Dukakis as ``Tax Hike Mike,'' said ``I'venever met a voter yet who wanted his taxes raised.''   Frank Donatelli, assistant to President Reagan for political andinter-governmental affairs, criticized Dukakis, saying he wanted toreturn to the ``weak-kneed foreign policy of the past,'' as opposedto Reagan's success with ``foreign policy from strength.''   The former candidates all pledged to work for Bush.   ``This election may determine the destiny of the nation. Thisparty is destined to govern for the rest of the century,''Robertson said.   Dole said that the party needed unity to defeat Democrats.   ``We make the speeches, you're going to have to do the work,''Dole said. ``Think what it would be like if we lost. You probablywouldn't want to get out of bed in the morning.''   Haig branded Dukakis as a candidate of dangerous change.   ``George Bush is the only candidate who can address the deficit.He is the candidate of safe change. There is no other solution, andGod help us if Michael Dukakis wins. He is the candidate of radicaland dangerous change,'' Haig said.</TEXT></DOC>
