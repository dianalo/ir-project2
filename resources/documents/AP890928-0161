In another development, former Australian Prime Minister MalcolmFraser said Commonwealth leaders have indicated he is the leadingcandidate to succeed Ramphal in June, ahead of Nigerian Chief EmekaAnyaoku.   This conflicted with reports by Commonwealth secretariat sourcesthat Anyaoku is virtually certain to get the job.   On South Africa, Ramphal said the Commonwealth will continue topress for tough embargoes. But he indicated it will not try at itsbiennial summit meeting in Malaysia next month to impose newmeasures _ thus avoiding a dispute with Britain.   ``The Commonwealth (Britain apart) will continue to use thepressure of sanctions to persuade South Africa to end apartheid,and to mobilize wider international support to this end,'' saidRamphal.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the sole leader inthe mainly African, Asian and Caribbean association of Britain andits former colonies who publicly opposes tough measures againstSouth Africa, a major trading partner of Britain.   She says sanctions would hurt blacks most, invite cheating andharden white South African resistance to change.   Addressing a luncheon given by Commonwealth journalists, Ramphaladded, ``I don't think the time is ripe for the introduction of anew package of sanctions, but for sending a clear message that theycan be expected if there is no evidence of clear progress.''   Instead, Ramphal said, the Commonwealth is concentrating ongetting banks to refuse to reschedule South Africa's foreign debt.   South Africa's repayment agreement on $8 billion of foreign debtexpires next June and government and banking officials are battlingfor new agreements.   At a news conference at the Australian High Commission, Frasersaid ``a hard-headed and unsentimental count'' by Australianmissions and another major supporter put him ahead in the contestfor Ramphal's job.   Answering a question, he said Canada backed him, but declined toidentify other supporters.   He added he had ``significant support'' in Africa. ``A number ofAfrican countries have told me they want to make a decision on theman, not on a regional basis,'' said Fraser.   Commonwealth leaders are to decide on the new secretary-generalduring their meeting in Malaysia.   Anyaoku is a deputy to Ramphal, a Guyanese who has held the jobfor 15 years.   Commonwealth secretariat sources who requested anonymitymaintain Anyaoku, who would be the first African Commonwealthsecretary-general, has a strong lead, including backing from almostall African and Caribbean members.</TEXT></DOC>
