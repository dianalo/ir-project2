Q: General, do you plan to get dependents or other U.S.personnel out of Panama now?   GEN. KELLY: Not immediately. We have not implemented any planalong those lines.   Q: General, with some of your goals accomplished, are there anythought _ is there any thought being given now to withdrawing someU.S. troops?   GEN. KELLY: My boss indicated, I think this morning, that therewere no timelines, that we were going to stay there long enough toget the job done. I don't think I see this as a long, long-termeffort, U.S. troops in Panama, combat troops for months or years,but I think that it's going to take a little while to help thecountry get back on its feet. You've got to realize they've gonethrough an awful time over the last couple of years with Noriega,who has done a great deal to break down the social fabric of thecountry, and we've got to try and help them rebuild it.   Q: General _   Q: Can you give an update on casualties _ an update on casualtynumbers?   GEN. KELLY: Yeah, I can. Okay, we've lost so far fourhelicopters, but three of those four will probably be _ and this isan assertion on my part _ repairable, and the fourth one, if we getit back _ it's in the water _ may be. And that was one Apache andthree observation helicopters. We have had 11 military people _ oneMarine, I believe, the rest soldiers _ killed, 59 wounded, and onemissing, and I mentioned the one dependent who was dead. You know,one _ one dead American is too many, but, thank God, the numbersdon't appear too high right now.   Q: Do you know how many of those were accidental, General?   GEN. KELLY: To my knowledge, none of them were accidental.   Q: General, on a scale of one to ten, how successful would yousay this operation has been so far?   GEN. KELLY: Oh, ten. And you're asking the wrong guy.(Laughter.) I think that it is among the most professionallyexecuted operations that I have seen in 33 years of militaryservice. Recall that the _ that the so-called war status wasdeclared on Friday, the Marine was killed on Saturday, the familybeating and harrassment occurred on Saturday. We made a decision,and in almost no time at all we were putting our paratroopers andour Rangers on airplanes and sending them down there. I don't knowthat there's another country in the world that can do that. I doknow that I'm a pretty biased guy when it comes to the U.S.military, and I think that we have the finest leaders we haveavailable running things in Panama.   Q: General Kelly, following that if I could sir, in theaftermath of Grenada, can you tell us, do you have any reports yetof perhaps communications gear that couldn't communicate back andforth, men dropped in the wrong place, those kinds of problemsrepeating?   GEN. KELLY: We have indications that human beings in Panama havemade mistakes, you know, history is replete with that. As far asmajor glitches are concerned, Ted and I have been on the _ in theNMCC on the communications. There has never been a second that wehaven't had direct voice communications with the commander and hisstaff. In Panama, there's never been a second that they haven'tbeen in communication with Gen. Steiner, the Southern Task ForceCommander, JTF South, Joint Task Force South. And, no, we have nothad those kind of glitches.   Q: Did you have any problems with any kind of weather?   GEN. KELLY: No, no. We had weather problems, of course, up inFort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base trying to get out yesterday. Wehad an ice storm, and we had one heck of a time getting theairplanes de-iced, and we had problems out of Travis today withfog; that slowed us down getting out.   Q: General, on that point _   GEN. KELLY: But we still made the TOTs (Time Over Target).   Q: _ would you like to have started this operation sooner? Wouldyou like to have had it conducted sooner than one this morning?   GEN. KELLY: If you could wave a magic wand and get the MAC(Military Airlift Command) aircraft together and do all those kindsof things, I would like it to have started just the second thePresident said we could go. We were in a position where we had totell him that it takes so many hours to get that many airplanestogether, because they're all around the world, and we don't havean excess number of those aircraft.   Q: General _   Q: General, on the amount of equipment we've thrown into thisfight in the way of planes, tanks, helicopters, what force, inaddition to manpower, are we actually bringing to bear here?   GEN. KELLY: Reasonable force. I am a tanker. We have four tanksin Panama, and they're Sheridans, which, as you may recall, arelight vehicles that have a 152mm gun and were originally designedprimarily to fire a Shillelagh missile. They came out of the 82ndAirborne Division, and that's the only TOandamp;E battalion in the Armyleft with the Sheridans because the M1 tanks are too heavy to beair-dropped.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
