For example, some plans did not have arrangements for the promptnotification of offsite response organizations.Upon noting these weaknesses, the NRC staff prepared orders requiring 62licensees to submit comprehensive onsite radiological contingency plans(46 FR 12566). These orders, which were issued in February 1981, requiredsome licensees, based on their licensed possession limits, to plan foractions that would be needed in the event of an accident. The actions wouldbe those necessary to protect workers, limit the release of radioactivematerials, and mitigate adverse consequences of the accident. The orderswere issued to operators of fuel processing and fabrication plants, UF<T2>6</T2> production plants, and radioactive material users authorizedto possess large quantities of radioactive materials in unsealed form.The licensees selected were those authorized to possess quantities of radioactivematerials that could as a result of a severe accident potentially resultin a radiation exposure in excess of 1 rem total body, 5 rems to the thyroid,or 3 rems to other body organs. As a result of these orders, about halfof the affected licensees reduced their authorized possession limits forradioactive material, thus no longer requiring them to submit contingencyplans to NRC.On June 3, 1981, the Commission published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 29712) an advance notice of proposed rulemakingon emergency preparedness for certain fuel cycle and other radioactivematerial licensees. In this advance notice, the Commission proposed tocodify the radiological contingency planning requirements set forth inthe Commission's orders, as well as consider requiring offsite emergencyplans. The Commission noted in the advance notice that it would use factorssuch as possession limits, potential for accidental criticality, chemicaltoxicity of radioactive materials, and potential radiation hazards forall of the NRC licensees whose radioactive material possession limits weresuch that severe accidents could result in offsite radiation doses exceedingthe lower end of the protective action guides proposed by the EPA.The Commission received 18 responses to its advance notice of proposedrulemaking. The most significant comment was to question the need for therule. After considering the comments the Commission decided to go forwardwith rulemaking and published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 20, 1987 (52 FR 12921). That <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice discusses the comments on the AdvanceNotice in more detail.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule is summarized below. The public comments and responsesto them are discussed after the summary of the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Licensees Needing Plans</ITAG>The criteria selected for establishing whether a licensed facility wouldbe required to establish and maintain an emergency plan for significantaccidental releases were whether a credible severe accident could theoreticallydeliver a radiation dose of 1 rem effective dose equivalent,\1\<NOTE/> 5 rems to the thyroid, or soluble uranium intake exceeding2 milligrams to a member of the public. Soluble uranium, although weaklyradioactive, is primarily a toxic chemical hazard. Two milligrams is anintake from which no clinical evidence of chemical injury would be expected.This is discussed in more detail in the resolution of public comments section.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The effective dose equivalent is defined as the sum ofthe external radiation dose equivalent plus the dose equivalent to eachbody organ due to radioactivity deposited within the body multiplied bya risk weighting factor for the organ. The weighting factors are takenfrom ``Recommendations of the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection,'' ICRP Publication 26, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1977. ICRP Publication26 is available for purchase from Pergamon Press, Elmsford, NY.The EPA recommends that actions to protect the public be considered ifprojected whole body doses due to an accident are in the range of 1 to5 rems or thyroid doses are in the range of 5 to 25 rems, taking into accountthe practicality of the actions that would be taken. The proposed ruleused the low end of the dose ranges as the criteria for establishing whethera licensed facility needs an emergency plan for responding to a release.The joint NRC-EPA policy on the meaning of the protective action guideswas published in NUREG-0396/EPA 520/1-78-016, ``Planning Basis for theDevelopment of State and Local Government Radiological Emergency ResponsePlans in Support of Light Water Nuclear Power Plants.'' That report stated,``The nature of PAGs [protective action guides] is such that they cannotbe used to assure that a given level of exposure to individuals in thepopulation is prevented. In any particular response situation, a rangeof doses may be experienced, principally depending on the distance fromthe point of release. Some of these doses may be well in excess of thePAG levels and clearly warrant the initiation of any feasible protectionactions. This does not mean, however, that doses above PAG levels can beprevented or that emergency response plans should have as their objectivepreventing doses above PAG levels.'' Thus, protective action guide dosesrepresent trigger points for taking protective actions. They are not doselimits that cannot be exceeded. The EPA's draft protective action guides apply to radiation received uniformlyover the body. These guidelines are not applicable if the radiation doseis not uniform or if only some body organs receive the radiation dose.To account for radionuclides that would be deposited nonuniformly in thebody, such as those possessed by fuel cycle and other radioactive materiallicensees, the effective dose equivalent from these radionuclides is usedto replace the whole body dose equivalent.The conservative accident scenarios and dose calculations which formedthe technical basis for the proposed rule are described in ``RegulatoryAnalysis of Emergency Preparedness for Fuel Cycle and Other RadioactiveMaterial Licensees,'' NUREG-1140.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ NUREGs-0396, 1140, 1179, 1189, 1198, and CR-3657 may bepurchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government PrintingOffice, P.O. Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013-7082. Copies are also availablefrom the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road,Springfield, VA 22161. Copies are available for inspection or copying (fora fee) in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC.Doses were calculated for a ``standard man,'' taken to represent a normaladult. Doses to infants and children would be slightly different than adultdoses. The NRC considered the differences between adult doses and childdoses to be insignificant in comparison with the other uncertainties inthe analysis. The NRC also considered that the inherent conservatism inits accident dose calculations and its use of the 1-rem lower end of therange for protective action consideration provide an adequate margin ofsafety.For most licensees who would have to establish and maintain a plan, thedegree of risk to the public is small. Consider first those licensees thatdo not possess significant quantities of uranium hexafluoride (UF<T2>6</T2>), which is primarily a chemical hazard. For most of those licensees,even worst-case doses to an individual on the plume centerline off-sitewould be less than 5 or 10 rems. Realistically, actual doses that anyonewould receive should be lower. Finally, the probability of a serious radiologicalaccident is small, less than 10^\4\/yr, and the probability of a seriousaccident simultaneous with highly adverse meteorology is less than 10^\5\/yr.Details are provided in the Regulatory Analysis, NUREG-1140, Sections 2.4,2.5, and 3.The rupture of a large heated cylinder of UF<T2>6</T2> is an exception in that both the probability of a large releaseand the consequences due to the chemical toxicity of the released materialcould be of greater concern than the radiation doses from other accidentsat fuel cycle or other radioactive material facilities. As part of theanalysis for this rulemaking, the rupture outdoors of a hot cylinder containing14 tons of UF<T2>6</T2> was analyzed, and predictions were made concerning the consequencesof such a rupture. These predictions, calculated and published prior toan actual release that occurred on January 4, 1986, at the Sequoyah FuelsCorporation facility (``Rupture of a Model 48Y UF<T2>6</T2> Cylinder and Release of Uranium Hexafluoride,'' NRC Report NUREG-1179,February 1986) were compared with the actual results of the accident. Thequantity and duration of the release were quite close to what was predicted.Also, it appears that the actual onsite and offsite consequences were alsoquite close to what was predicted. (``Assessment of the Public Health Impactfrom the Accidental Release of UF<T2>6</T2> at the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation Facility at Gore, Oklahoma,''NRC Report NUREG-1189, March 1986.)Airborne releases due to a severe accident at these licensed facilitiesare likely to occur rapidly with little warning. The only types of accidentsidentified in NUREG-1140 for which protective action guide doses, or the2-milligram soluble uranium intake, could theoretically be exceeded area fire, a UF<T2>6</T2> cylinder rupture, and a criticality accident. Releases froma fire could start even before the fire is detected or shortly thereafter.Plume travel time to nearby people is likely to be no more than a few minutes.Releases would usually end when the local fire department has controlledthe fire, generally within half an hour to an hour. Releases of UF<T2>6</T2> are likely to start without warning and be of short duration.Many other accidental releases could also start without warning and beof short duration. As a result, protective actions would usually have tobe taken very quickly to be effective. Protective actions could also beeffective if the release were not as fast.In view of two factors_(1) realistically, exposures should generally below compared to protective action guides and (2) the fast-moving natureof the accidents of concern_formal evacuation planning is not considerednecessary, appropriate, or feasible. In particular, evacuation of neighborhoodsbefore plume arrival would most often not be possible. Thus, the emphasisof the licensee's emergency preparedness should be on ending the accidentas quickly as possible, reducing the quantity of material released, protectingworkers onsite, recommending appropriate protective actions to offsiteofficials, notifying offsite response organizations of the accident, andpromptly restoring the facility to a safe condition. Offsite, it wouldbe appropriate for police and fire personnel to either move people outof areas of dense smoke or fumes or get them to seek shelter indoors. Suchactions are routine for fires and chemical releases and would be expectedwhether the offsite response organizations had formal written emergencyplans or not.The proposed amendments to Parts 30, 40 and 70 would require that licenseesauthorized to possess in excess of certain large quantities of byproductmaterials, source materials, and special nuclear materials submit emergencyplans for responding to releases. Alternatively, an evaluation that showsthat offsite doses due to a release of radioactive materials would notexceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent, a thyroid dose of 5 rems, or asoluble uranium intake exceeding 2 milligrams would be acceptable. Therule would also cover any future plutonium fuel fabrication plants.The table of quantities in Part 30 that would require evaluation of theneed for an emergency plan was taken from ``A Regulatory Analysis of EmergencyPreparedness for Fuel Cycle and Other Radioactive Material Licensees,''NUREG-1140. The table lists quantities that might theoretically deliveran effective dose equivalent of 1 rem in the event of a severe accident.The quantities were calculated by assuming that the most exposed memberof the public would inhale a fraction of 10^\6\ of those materials. Externaldoses from immersion in the cloud and groundshine were then added to theinternal dose. The 1-rem effective dose equivalent is a 50-year dose commitmentcalculated by the methods of ICRP Publications 26, 28, and 30.The table in Part 30 includes all nuclides, except for I-129, listed on20 or more of NRC's approximately 9,000 byproduct material licenses. (I-129was not included in the table because saturation would prevent the thyroidfrom absorbing enough I-129 to reach the 5-rem protective action guidefor thyroid dose. Thus, I-29 is too weakly radioactive to be significantto emergency planning.) The table also includes all betagamma emitterslisted on any license for which the quantity to deliver a 1-rem effectivedose equivalent would be less than 10,000 curies. The table also includesall alpha emitters listed on any license for which the quantity to theoreticallydeliver a 1-rem effective dose equivalent would be less than 2 curies.In Part 40, emergency plans would be required only for handling significantquantities of uranium hexafluoride. It was concluded in NUREG-1140 thaturanium and thorium in chemical forms less volatile than uranium hexafluoridewould not require emergency plans because plausible releases would notcause doses exceeding 1 rem effective dose equivalent, the threshold dosefor requiring an emergency plan. The dose threshold would not be exceededbecause the low volatility of uranium and thorium compounds, other thanuranium hexafluoride, causes low release fractions and because the lowspecific activities of uranium and thorium result in low doses from a givenweight of material.The chemical toxicity of uranium and thorium are also not of concern exceptfor the highly soluble uranium from a uranium hexafluoride release. Othercompounds of uranium or thorium would not cause as large an intake dueto lower quantities released and are not as acutely toxic as the very solubleuranium compound created when uranium hexafluoride is released.In Part 70, plans would be required for potential releases of plutoniumand releases due to criticality accidents in addition to uranium hexafluoridereleases. The offsite dose analyses for criticality accidents and plutoniumreleases are included in NUREG-1140.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hazardous Chemical Releases</ITAG>The NRC also considered requiring emergency planning for NRC-licensed facilitieswith nonradioactive hazardous chemicals. Certain NRC-licensed facilitiesthat would be required to have an emergency plan for radioactive materialsmight also have nonradioactive hazardous chemicals. With respect to theresponse to a hazardous chemical accident by onsite personnel, however,Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a rule on ``HazardousWaste Operations and Emergency Response,'' in section 1910.120 of Title29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The rule would cover ``employerswhose employees have a reasonable possibility in engaging in emergencyresponse operations for releases of, or substantial threats of releasesof, hazardous substances without regard to the location of the hazard.''Moreover, issue of offsite emergency planning, preparedness, and responsefor release of hazardous chemicals was addressed by the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-499, enacted October 17, 1986.Title III of that Act, independently entitled, ``Emergency Planning andCommunity Right-To-Know Act of 1986,'' establishes a comprehensive anddetailed program under the auspices of EPA for community involvement, planning,training, emergency notification, response, and enforcement in the eventof an offsite release of certain chemicals as well as radioactive materials.All facilities with a threshold quantity of any of several hundred chemicalsare subject to the Act.In a final rule, the EPA established threshold planning quantities andassociated reportable quantities for certain ``extremely hazardous substances''(52 FR 13378; April 22, 1987). The EPA also proposed draft reportable quantitiesfor releases of radioactive materials (52 FR 8172; March 16, 1987).The Superfund Act requires each State to establish local emergency planningdistricts with a local emergency planning committee in each district. Owneror operators of covered facilities are required to notify the emergencycoordinator of the local emergency planning committee immediately upona release of specified quantities of certain chemicals. Failure to immediatelyreport a release may cause the facility owner or operator to be subjectto an EPA fine of up to $25,000 (and imprisoned for up to two years ifthe violation is willful).The Act also requires that each local emergency planning committee preparean emergency plan for its district. Plans must include the following: ``(1)Identification of facilities subject to the requirements * * * (2) Methodsand procedures to be followed by facility owners and operators and localemergency and medical personnel to respond to any release * * * (3) Designationof a community response coordinator and facility emergency coordinators* * * (4) Procedures providing reliable, effective, and timely notificationby the facility response coordinators and the community response coordinatorto persons designated in the emergency plan and to the public that a releasehas occurred * * * (5) Methods for determining the occurrence of a releaseand the area of population to be affected by such release * * * (6) A descriptionof emergency equipment and facilities in the community and at each facility* * * and identification of the persons responsbile for such equipmentand facilities * * * (7) Evacuation plans * * * (8) Training programs,including schedules for training of local emergency response and medicalpersonnel * * * and (9) Methods and schedules for exercising the emergencyplan.''The Act requires facility owners and operators to provide local emergencyplanning committees promptly with any information the committees need todevelop and implement the emergency plans. Failure or delay in providingrequested information may result in an EPA fine of no more than $25,000per day.The Act and NRC's regulation are complementary. On the one hand the Actprovides for offsite reponses to accidents involving hazardous chemicals.On the other hand, the NRC rule adds the ability to respond to potentialreleases of radioactive materials to possibly reduce offsite doses.A review of the EPA reference listed chemicals indicates that some NRCmaterials licensees that would be subject to radiological emergency planningfor releases of radioactive materials might be subject to the new law.It is also highly likely that several hundred, if not thousands, of othermaterials licensees, that would not be subject to radiological emergencyplanning, will be subject to the new law. The new law is more comprehensive,detailed, and demanding than any program contemplated or recommended bythe NRC staff for offsite emergency planning for nonradiological chemicalhazards. The Act requires State and local participation, but the issuanceof other permits and licenses to a chemical facility operator is not madecontingent upon facility compliance. Rather, facility compliance is expectedbecause of heavy civil penalties for failure to abide by the recordkeeping,reporting and notification provisions of the Act.The NRC staff, accordingly, believes that any obligation of NRC to ensureadequate emergency planning and response for releases offsite of hazardouschemicals can be met by requiring that applicants for licenses and forlicense renewals who are subject to the radiological emergency planningrequirements certify that they are in compliance with the Emergency Planningand Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986. Therefore, the rule requires NRClicensees having the potential for significant offsite releases of radioactivematerials to certify they are in compliance with the requirements of theEmergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 with respectto hazardous chemicals they may possess.Licensees not required by this rule to have an emergency plan for licensedmaterial are also not required to certify to NRC compliance with the EmergencyPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986. The rule is directedtoward and affects only those licensees with the potential for a significantrelease of licensed radioactive material, taking into account both theradiological and chemical toxicity of the licensed material. Undoubtedly,many NRC licensees who are not covered by the rule possess in excess ofthe threshold quantities of some hazardous chemical. The NRC in this rulemakinghas not made a finding that those hazardous chemicals do not require emergencypreparedness. Rather, the licensees are otherwise required by law to complywith the requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-KnowAct of 1986.Uranium hexafluoride production facilities are covered by the Act becausethey possess hydrogen fluoride and fluorine, both of which are on the listof hazardous chemicals. The local emergency planning committee for eacharea is required by the Act to decide, among other things, the area orpopulation that could be affected by a release as well as procedures fortimely notification of the public. NUREG-1140 recommended a distance ofone mile downwind from the release point as the distance affected. Thisdistance is based on U.S. Department of Transportation criteria for releasesof hazardous chemicals in transport accidents. The criteria are those usedby the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to derive theemergency action distances given in ``Hazardous Materials-Emergency ResponseGuidebook,'' U.S. Department of Transportation Report DOT-P5800.4, 1987.\3\<NOTE/> However, the local emergency planning committees may selectany distance or criteria they consider appropriate. In addition, the localemergency planning committees also select the means of notifying the public.(Technical guidance for site-specific hazard analysis is being developedby an interagency group.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Information on the availability of DOT-P5800.4 can beobtained from the Office of Hazardous Material Transportation (DHM-51),Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation,Washington, DC 20590.An important difference between the NRC requirement and the ``EmergencyPlanning and Community Right-To-Know'' requirement concerns when to notifyoffsite officials. The NRC requirement is for notification as soon as anaccident that might cause a release is detected. The NRC requires notificationif a fire were detected even if a release is not taking place or the licenseedoes not know whether a release is taking place. In most circumstances,it is likely to take the licensee a considerable time to determine whethera release has occurred. The Act requires notification only when it is knownthat a release exceeding reportable quantities has occurred. Thus, theNRC rule, in a practical sense, may require notification hours before notificationwould be required by the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Lessons Learned From a Uranium Hexafluoride Release</ITAG>On January 4, 1986, a cylinder filled considerably above its 14-ton capacitywith uranium hexafluoride ruptured while being heated at the Sequoyah FuelsCorporation facility in Gore, Oklahoma. One worker died and several otherworkers were injured. The death and injuries were caused by exposure tohydrofluoric acid, produced by a reaction of the uranium hexafluoride withairborne mositure.After the accident, the NRC formed a Lessons-Learned Group that reviewedthe accident and recommended improvements. (See ``Release of UF<T2>6</T2> from a Ruptured Model 48Y Cylinder at Sequoyah Fuels CorporationFacility: Lessons-Learned Report,'' NRC report NUREG-1198, June 1986.)A number of the recommendations were relevant to this rule and were consideredin the proposed rule. Most were fully adopted. The specific recommendationsand their resolution were discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule(52 FR 12921, April 20, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">Option To Demonstrate That a Plan Is Not Needed</ITAG>Licensees are given the option of demonstrating that emergency plans forresponding to accidental releases are not needed because doses would notexceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent as a result of a credible accidentat their specific facility. The table of radionuclides in the proposedregulations was developed using conservative, pessimistic, or ``worst-case''assumptions. Each assumption is possible at some ``generic facility, butmay not be realistic for an actual facility. Thus the licensee is giventhe option an analyzing accidents for the actual existing facility anddetermining site-specific maximum credible releases. If after the review,the NRC staff agrees that the resulting doses would be below 1 rem effectivedose equivalent, an emergency plan for responding to the release wouldnot be required.The licensee also has the option of revising facility design, operatingprocedures, or possession limits to reduce potential doses below 1 remeffective dose equivalent in lieu of preparing an emergency plan for respondingto an accidental release.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Plan Contents</ITAG>If an emergency plan for responding to an accidental release is needed,it would include:(1) Facility description. A brief description of the licensee's facilityand area near the site. The purpose is to provide the reader with enoughbasic information to evaluate the licensee's plan. Significant nearby facilities,such as schools, should be included in the site area description.(2) Types of accidents. An identification of each type of radioactive materialsaccident for which protective actions might be needed. Typically, the accidentsof concern are fires involving radioactive materials, releases of largequantities of uranium hexafluoride, and criticalities involving high-enricheduranium or plutonium. Releases of hazardous chemicals that could affectthe radiological safety of the facility and result in releases of or exposureto radioactive materials must also be considered.(3) Classification of accidents. A classification system for classifyingaccidents as alerts or site area emergencies. These classes are adoptedfrom nuclear power plant emergency planning, but modified for fuel cycleand other radioactive material licensees. For nuclear power plants, a generalemergency means there is a possibility of very large releases that couldcause acute radiation effects miles from the plant. Neither releases nordoses of those magnitudes could result from accidents at fuel cycle orother radioactive material licensees. Therefore, the general emergencyclass is not used for these facilities. A site area emergency means eventsmay occur, are in progress, or have occurred that could lead to a significantrelease of radioactive material and that could require a response by offsiteresponse organizations to protect persons offsite. Alert means events mayoccur, are in progress, or have occurred that could lead to a release ofradioactive materials, but that the release is not expected to requirea response by offsite response organizations to protect people offsite.(4) Detection of accidents. Identification of the means of detecting eachtype of accident in a timely manner. The means of detection could includeone or more of the following: fire alarms, criticality alarms, visual observation,stack monitors, or radiation monitors, as appropriate.(5) Mitigation of consequences. A brief description of the means and equipmentfor mitigating the consequences of each type of accident, including thoseprovided to protect workers onsite, and description of the program formaintaining the equipment. Mitigating actions could include actions toreduce or stop the release and actions to protect workers such as evacuatingthe building or decontaminating personnel. Means for limiting releasescould include sprinkler systems and other fire suppression systems, firedetection systems, physical separation of material, storage in fire-resistantcontainers, use of fire-resistant building materials, fire-fighting capabilities,procedures prohibiting flammable materials in areas where radioactive materialsare found, filter systems, use of water sprays to knock-down UF<T2>6</T2>, and others.Equipment might include respiratory protection equipment for employees,evacuation alarms, and equipment possessed by the licensee to reduce orstop the release. It would not include equipment brought to the site byoffsite response organizations.This item is not intended to require backfits or design changes. Plantdesign is subject to a more complete safety review when the license applicationis reviewed.(6) Assessment of releases. A brief description of the methods and equipmentto assess releases of radioactive materials.This does not mean real-time assessment. It means measurements made afterthe release has occurred to determine how much material was released. TheNRC does not believe that real-time estimates of releases are generallypossible for the types of accidents of concern. Significant releases arenot likely to occur by way of monitored release paths. Monitored pathswould generally contain filters that would reduce any release to negligiblelevels. Even if a release were detected from a monitored release path therewould generally be no way to determine that additional material was notbeing released by way of unmonitored paths. In addition, even if one couldassure that the entire release were monitored so that a release rate couldbe determined, there would be no way to know the duration of the releaseor whether the release rate would subsequently rise or fall. Beyond this,measurements of releases would generally be made much too late to be ofany usefulness during the emergency response.The recommended approach, therefore, is to estimate a range of potentialsource terms for each accident type in the planning and then decide inthe planning what recommendations would be made to offsite response organizationsfor each accident type. In summary, one cannot wait until a potential accidentis underway to decide what recommendations should be made. There is notenough time during the accident.One purpose of the assessment is to be able to determine whether an immediatenotification of the National Response Center is necessary under the EmergencyPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 if the quantity of radioactivematerial released exceeds those listed by EPA (52 FR 8172). In most situationsthe first organizations to be notified would be the local offsite responseorganizations. Thus, in the case of a fire the fire department would benotified first before it was known if any radioactive material were evenbeing released. The assessment would not be available for hours or evendays after the accident. As soon as an assessment was made, however, theNational Response Center should be immediately notified if the assessedrelease exceeds a reportable quantity.(7) Responsibilities. A brief description of the responsibilities of licenseepersonnel should an accident occur, including the identification of personnelresponsible for promptly notifying offsite response organizations and theNRC; also responsibilities for developing, maintaining, and updating theplan. In general, responsibilities should be described for the positionrather than by naming individuals so that personnel changes do not requireamending the emergency plan. Offsite response organizations would generallyinclude fire, police, medical, state radiological safety organizations,and perhaps other emergency personnel. (Agreement State licensees wouldnotify the State rather than the NRC.)(8) Notification and coordination. A commitment and a brief descriptionof the means to promptly notify offsite response organizations and requestoffsite assistance, including medical assistance for the treatment of contaminatedinjured onsite workers when appropriate. A control point must be established.Notification should include the organizations responsible for notifyingthe public near the site to take protective actions. The means of notificationand coordination must be planned so that unavailability of some personnel,parts of the facility, and some equipment will not prevent the notificationand coordination. The licensee shall also commit to notify the NRC OperationsCenter immediately after notification of the appropriate offsite responseorganizations and not later than one hour after the licensee declares anemergency. (The commercial telephone number at the operations center is(301) 951-0550.) In addition, the licensee should notify the National ResponseCenter immediately after the size of the release has been assessed if theestimated quantity of material released exceeds the reportable quantitiesestablished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This last notificationpermits licensees to meet the requirements of the Emergency Planning andCommunity Right-to-Know Act of 1986.In general, the State Radiological protection organization would be amongthe offsite response organizations that would be notified by NRC licensees.In a few cases, the licensee may want to seek assistance from the Departmentof Energy under the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan (see 50FR 46524, November 8, 1985).(9) Information to be communicated. A brief description of the types ofinformation on facility status, radioactive releases, and recommended actions,if necessary, to be given to offsite response organizations and to theNRC.(10) Training. A brief description of the frequency, performance objectivesand plans for the training that the licensee will provide workers on howto respond to an emergency including any special instructions and orientationtours the licensee would offer to fire, police, medical, and other emergencypersonnel. The training shall familiarize personnel with site-specificemergency procedures. Also, the training shall thoroughly prepare sitepersonnel for their responsibilities in the event of accident scenariospostulated as most probable for the specific site, including the use ofteam training for such scenarios.Instructions on how to deal with the radiation release should be appropriatefor the personnel and should clearly state the specific actions expectedof them and things they should and should not do. After the more comprehensiveinitial training, refresher briefings are suggested annually. A desirabletime would be soon after the exercise has been conducted so that trainingdeficiencies can be corrected and recommendations from the audits relevantto training can be implemented. Refresher briefings for offsite responseorganizations should be conducted at a frequency considered appropriateby those organizations.(11) Recovery. A brief description of the means of restoring the facilityto a safe condition after different types of accidents. Detailed proceduresare not appropriate because the exact nature of the accident cannot beforeseen. Instead general criteria are appropriate.(12) Exercises. A brief description of the provisions for conducting quarterlycommunications checks with offsite response organizations and biennialonsite exercises to test response to simulated emergencies. The licenseeshall invite offsite response organizations to participate in the biennialexercises. Exercises must use accident scenarios postulated as most probablefor the specific site and the scenarios shall not be known to most exerciseparticipants. A critique of each exercise must be conducted by individualsnot having direct implementation responsibility for the plan. Critiquesof exercises must evaluate the appropriateness of the plan, emergency procedures,facilities, equipment, training or personnel, and overall effectivenessof the response. Deficiencies found by the critiques must be corrected.The exercises are for the purpose of familiarizing the licensee personnelwith the emergency plan, training them in the use of site-specific responseprocedures, and for identifying and correcting deficiencies in the plan.All deficiencies in the plan must be corrected, including problems withprocedures, training, staffing, equipment, and so forth. Participationby offsite personnel is not required.(13) Hazardous chemicals. A certification that the applicant has met itsresponsibilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct of 1986, Title III, Pub. L. 99-499, if applicable to the applicant'sactivities at the proposed place of use of the radioactive material. Inthis, the licensee acknowledges his responsibility under that Act. It isnot Commission intent to review the licensee's compliance as that fallsunder the EPA's jurisdiction.In brief, the licensee is required to give prompt notification to appropriateoffsite response organizations, providing these organizations with informationon the situation and recommended actions, and assuring that these officialshave been offered instruction in advance. In addition, in order to assurethat offsite response organizations expected to respond to an accidenthave been consulted in the formulation of the plan, the licensee must allowsuch offsite organizations 60 days to comment on the plan and must providethese comments to the NRC.Most, if not all, of the licensees who are required to submit an emergencyplan by this regulation have already submitted onsite Radiological ContingencyPlans under the orders issued in 1981. Those plans already include mostof the information required under the new regulation, but some of the plansmay require some changes to meet the new rule. At the time of renewal oftheir licenses, licensees must resubmit their plan revised to conform tothe new rule as a part of their renewal application. Alternatively, theselicensees could submit an evaluation showing that an emergency plan isnot necessary.The staff identified about 60 NRC licensees who are covered by the rule.The staff estimated, however, that about 15 of those licensees will probablylower their possession limits so they are not covered and that about 15will probably demonstrate that the 1-rem dose is not plausible. Realistically,probably no more than about 30 licensees will actually need an emergencyplan. Perhaps 10 to 15 Agreement State licensees will also eventually becovered because the new requirements will be a matter of compatibilitywith Agreement States.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>Eighteen public comments were received. Three were from States, elevenwere from licensees, one was from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,one was from a private citizen, one was from a fire protection association,and one was from an environmental group. The more significant commentsare summarized below followed by the Commission's response.<T3>Comment:</T3> Possibly the most significant comment was that the ruleshould not be adopted at all because there is no need for it. Some commentersthought that the NRC should concentrate on requiring engineered safeguardsto prevent the accidents and thus eliminate the need for the plan. Othersalso considered the NRC's dose calculations too conservative because thecalculations multiplied a series of worst-case assumptions to calculateoffsite doses. They cited the example of assuming the facility burns butthe smoke is not buoyant and does not rise. Commenters said that not allassumptions would be appropriate for any particular facility. Commenterssaid the costs did not justify the benefits. They said the NRC underestimatedthe costs of compliance with the requirements, saying that annual exercises,for example, would be very expensive and were not properly accounted for.Commenters also said that NRC overestimated the benefits. They said thatthe accidents of concern would happen so quickly that no offsite responsewould ever be effective at reducing offsite exposures, regardless of cost.Commenters suggested that Part 30 licensees (those with radioactive byproductmaterial, for example, tritium or radioactive iodine) should be excludedfrom the requirements. Commenters said that the requirements would damagefacilities' public relations and cause unjustified public fear of the facilityfor no good reason.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC has decided to proceed with the rule. Any systemof engineered safeguards is considered to have some possibility of failure.No system could ever be perfect. Therefore, the NRC has decided to requireanother level of protection beyond engineered safeguards designed to preventor mitigate an accident if releases could cause doses exceeding protectiveaction guides. The NRC agrees that its dose calculations are very conservativeand that doses from an actual accident are likely to be far lower thancalculated. Nevertheless, the NRC considers the calculated doses to bepossible even if improbable. The NRC recognizes that the costs to licenseestend to exceed the anticipated benefits. Nonetheless, in view of the uncertaintiesinherent in making the cost-benefit balance, and considering in any eventthe limited additional financial burden that would result from adoptionof the rule, NRC concludes that the emergency planning measures are desirableto protect health. While the NRC agrees that in many instances it wouldnot be possible to reduce exposures offsite because there would not beenough time, the NRC believes that in some instances there would be a possibilityof reducing doses. The requirements are aimed at those potential dose savingsituations. There is no requirement, stated or implied, that the emergencyresponse would always be effective in reducing exposures offsite or thatspecified dose levels would not be exceeded. Instead, the requirement isthat the licensee be prepared to take some practical steps that could,in favorable circumstances, reduce radiation exposure to the public.<T3>Comment: </T3>The potential dose for requiring a plan should be 5 remsinstead of 1 rem. A reason given is that the analysis was conservativein that actual doses would be much less than the assumed values calculated.Thus, if the calculated dose were 5 rems, actual doses would be well below1 rem.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC did not accept this recommendation. The NRCconsiders the doses it calculated to be credible even though lower dosesare more probable. The EPA states the protective actions should be consideredat the lower end of the dose range. When doses for which the EPA statesthat protective actions should be considered are credible, the NRC believesthat there should be a formal emergency plan even if doses are likely tobe much less than the calculated values.<T3>Comment: </T3>Credit should be given for filters and other engineeredsafeguards designed to mitigate accidents and reduce releases. Credit shouldbe given when material is kept in different buildings.<T3>Response: </T3>In general, credit would not be given for filters becausethe accidents on which the need for emergency preparedness is based aresevere accidents such as large fires, possibly with explosions, in whichthe filters are assumed to be destroyed or the release is assumed to occurthrough an unprotected release path, such as a hole burned in the roofof the building. Credit could, however, be taken if material is storedin separate locations not likely to be affected by the same accident. Provisionto allow this credit is contained in the option that a licensee has toshow that an emergency plan is not necessary for all or part of his facility.<T3>Comment: </T3>The rule should require the licensee to provide a systemfor notifying the public offsite of a release. The licensee should be requiredto provide information brochures to people near the facilities annually.Emergency planning zones should be established.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC did not adopt these recommendations. The NRCrequires the licensee to promptly notify offsite response organizationsof the accident, but believes that notification of the public offsite isthe responsibility of the public safety officials in the area. The decisionand when and how to notify the public are considered to be their responsibility.This approach is consistent with the approach in the ``Emergency Planningand Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986.''The NRC believes that the normally available capabilities of States andlocal governments for responding to industrial emergencies and the normallyavailable radiological health capabilities of States will be adequate todeal with accidents at fuel cycle and other radioactive material licensees.These radiological emergencies would involve small (not life threatening)doses, small areas, and small numbers of people. The potential risks aremuch lower than the risks from accidents involving chemical plants or theshipping of hazardous chemicals, to which states and local governmentsroutinely respond. In other words, the response to radiological accidentsat fuel cycle and other radioactive materials licensees can and shouldbe handled by State and local governments as part of their normal emergencyresponse capability without additional resources.In most situations, the NRC would expect the local authorities to handlepublic notification and response on an ad hoc basis, the way those authoritieswould handle a truck or rail accident in which hazardous chemicals hadbeen, were being, or might be released. On the other hand, informationbrochures could be provided by offsite authorities to people near the facilitiesat the discretion of those authorities.The NRC intentionally did not establish emergency planning zones, decidinginstead to define the offsite response in terms of when offsite responseorganizations should be notified. The NRC concluded that dose projectionsduring an accident would not be possible. Thus, the size of the responsewould be dictated mainly by the practicality of response actions. Becausefires are the primary accident of concern, this would usually involve anyactions offsite that could reduce the exposure of people to smoke fromthe fire. Sheltering in or evacuation of nearby buildings would both besuitable, but again, the actual response would be determined by what waspractical at the time of the accident.<T3>Comment: </T3>Guidance should be given on what responses would be appropriateoffsite and to what distances they would be appropriate.<T3>Response: </T3>In general, the appropriate responses and distancesare dictated by what is practical at the time the accident occurs. Policeand emergency personnel have generally been quite proficient in handlingsimilar types of emergencies, such as truck and rail accidents. Suggestionson how to respond to the particular situation would also come from thelicensee at the time of the notification. Beyond this, some additionalguidance is given in NUREG-1140, Section 2.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>The NRC should publish a regulatory guide or other guidancedocument that fully explains how each of the requirements of the rule wouldbe met. That document should be published for public comment prior to finalformulation of the rule.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC is now preparing a guidance document. A draftwas published for public comment in November, 1987, and a revised finalversion will be available to licensees before they would have to startpreparing to comply with the new rule. (The new rule is effective one yearafter publication.)<T3>Comment: </T3>The potential uranium intake for which a plan would berequired should be 1 mg rather than 2 mg.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC did not accept this recommendation. A panelof experts evaluated the effects of uranium intake and concluded that intakesof 4 mg would have no effect and intakes of 8 mg would cause transientchanges in the chemical composition of urine, indicating some effect.\4\<NOTE/> The NRC then applied a factor of two margin to the 4 mg valueto account for possible increased sensitivity for children. The NRC seesno valid reason for lower values.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ R.A. Just and V.S.

The State shouldalso be able to review and approve the facility emergency plan.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees that the State should generally receiveimmediate notification, but the proposed rule already provided that byrequiring immediate notification of offsite response organizations. Ingeneral, the State radiological safety organization would be one of theoffsite response organizations. As one of the offsite response organizations,the rule provides that the State would be allowed to review the licensee'splan before it was submitted to NRC. The States' comments on the planswould be a factor that the NRC would consider in deciding whether or notto approve a plan.<T3>Comment: </T3>The EPA suggested that the rule contain a provision toremind licensees to notify the National Response Center if the estimatedquantity of material released exceeds the reportable quantities establishedby the EPA.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion was adopted.<T3>Comment: </T3>The assumed release fractions for chlorine and bromineshould be 0.5 because those materials could be in volatile or combustibleform.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees and adopted these recommendations. Thevalue of 0.5 assumes the material is volatile or combustible but that someof the material would not be affected, the material would plate out orbe deposited onsite, or would remain in ash.<T3>Comment: </T3>NUREG-1140, the draft regulatory analysis should be revisedand published in final. The conservatism in the calculations should bepointed out.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees. NUREG-1140 has been revised and publishedin final form. The conservatism in the calculations was noted.<T3>Comment: </T3>Exercises should be required once every two years ratherthan every year.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC accepts this recommendation.<T3>Comment: </T3>The NRC should fund or seek funding for States in whichthe facilities needing plans are located.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC does not support this recommendation. The rulerequires little or no additional capabilities on the parts of States beyondthis normal and existing capabilities to protect public health and safetyfrom emergencies of all types.<T3>Comment: </T3>The NRC should not duplicate the work of other agenciesby inspecting for compliance with the Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know Act of 1986.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC does not plan to duplicate the efforts of otheragencies. The licensee need only certify compliance with the Act. The NRCdoes not plan to inspect the adequacy of compliance with the Act. The Actgives that responsibility to the EPA, States, and the local emergency planningcommittees.<T3>Comment: </T3>Regulatory Guide 3.42, ``Emergency Planning for FuelCycle Facilities and Plants Licensed under 10 CFR Parts 50 and 70,'' September1979, is obsolete, refers to regulations that have since been amended,and is superseded by the new rule.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees. The guide will be revised.<T3>Comment: </T3>The definitions of the emergency classes are differentfrom those used by nuclear power plants.<T3>Response: </T3>While the definitions of the emergency classes are differentfrom nuclear power plants (i.e., ``core melt'' does not make sense forthese facilities), the meanings are compatible. In particular, the licenseeactions and the State and local offsite authority actions listed in NUREG-0654for the alert and site area emergency classes are essentially what wouldbe expected for those emergency classes at fuel cycle and other radioactivematerial facilities. The actions listed in NUREG-0654 for general emergencywould not be appropriate for any fuel cycle or radioactive material accident.Thus, the meaning and the expected responses for the emergency classeswould be similar for both nuclear power plants and fuel cycle and radioactivematerial facilities.<T3>Comment: </T3>Licensees having an emergency plan required by ordershould not have to rewrite their plan to comply with the new rule.<T3>Response: </T3>Because the requirements of the order and the new ruleare essentially the same, licensees would not have to submit a new planuntil their regular five-year license renewal application was due. Eventhen an attempt is being made to minimize the number of changes that wouldbe required.<T3>Comment: </T3>The question was raised as to whether exercise reviewerswould have to be present during the exercise.<T3>Response: </T3>A reviewer should be present. Otherwise, the reviewerwould have limited information on which to base a critique.<T3>Comment: </T3>Changes to the plan should be sent to the offsite responseorganizations.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees. The rule has been changed to includethe requirement. <T3>Comment: </T3>The rule was said to contradict the ``ALARA'' concept(radiation doses should be kept as low as is reasonably achievable) becausecosts would greatly exceed benefits.<T3>Response: </T3>The ``ALARA'' concept was designed with a view to assessingthe consequences of normal operations, not accidents. In the accident contextas here, the Commission considers it desirable to adopt the requirementsit has proposed; it recognizes that costs may exceed benefits but the additionalfinancial burdens are small and the cost benefit assessments involve substantialdegree of judgment.<T3>Comment: </T3>The limit for carbon-14 is wrong because carbon-14 wouldbe released as carbon dioxide in the accident scenarios presented.<T3>Response: </T3>The NRC agrees that for large releases most carbon-14would be released as carbon dioxide which has negligible deposition onsurfaces or in the lungs. Therefore the release fraction for carbon hasbeen changed to 0.01 to account for carbon released in other forms. Theamount needing a plan has been correspondingly increased.<T3>Comment: </T3>Methods of calculating doses from releases should bepublished.<T3>Response: </T3>The methods have been published in ``A Regulatory Analysisin Emergency Preparedness for Fuel Cycle and Other Radioactive MaterialLicenses,'' NUREG-1140 and in ``Preliminary Screening of Fuel Cycle andBy-Product Material Licenses for Emergency Planning,'' NUREG/CR-3657.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability</ITAG>The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmentalimpact statement is not required. The rule does not affect the probabilityof the size of accidental radioactive releases. It might in some casesreduce the doses people near the facility site could receive. The environmentalassessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determinationis based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.

These companies do not fall within the definition of a smallbusiness found in the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or within thesmall business size standards set forth in 13 CFR Part 121. The rule affectsabout 60 out of some 9,000 licensees. However, the staff believes thatabout 15 of these licensees could amend their licenses to reduce quantitiesof material they are authorized to possess and about 15 could perform anevaluation showing no need to be covered by the rule. Realistically, probablyno more than about 30 licensees will actually submit emergency plans. These30 licensees are essentially identical to those issued orders to requireonsite contingency plans in 1981. An additional 10 to 15 Agreement Statelicensees may have to submit emergency plans because the rule, will bemade an item of compatability with Agreement State programs.Thus, the rule does not impose a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Actof 1980.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>10 CFR Part 30Byproduct material, Government contracts, Intergovernmental relations,Isotopes, Nuclear materials, Penalty, Radiation protection, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.10 CFR Part 40Government contracts, Hazardous materials_transportation, Nuclear materials,Penalty, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Source material, Uranium.10 CFR Part 70Hazardous materials_transportation, Material control and accounting, Nuclearmaterials, Packaging and containers, Penalty, Radiation protection, Reportingand recordkeeping requirement, Scientific equipment, Security measures,Special nuclear material.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Views of Commissioner Curtiss</ITAG>Commissioner Curtiss opposed this rule and expressed the following views:<ITAG tagnum="21">The justification for the action proposed here is exceedingly weak_ifnot nonexistent. In particular, I have the following concerns:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The costs of the proposed action dwarf the negligible benefits.According to NUREG-1140, the annualized costs of establishing and maintainingemergency plans of the sort that are envisioned in the proposed rule rangefrom $30,000 to $77,000 per year. The resulting benefits range from $.20to $4 per year. Resulting protective actions could save from 2E-8 to 4E-7(i.e. .00000002 to .0000004) lives per year per facility. (NUREG-1140,pp. 109-112). Although I appreciate the fact that this action is not subjectto the backfit rule, numbers of this sort should nevertheless give us pauseabout moving forward. In short, there is little apparent need for the rulefrom a safety standpoint. As the staff acknowledges:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The cost of this preparedness may not be justified in terms of protectingpublic health and safety. Rather, we would justify it in terms of the intangiblebenefit of being able to reassure the public that if an accident happens,local authorities will be notified (presumably because the proposed ruleswill require licensees and local officials to practice notification proceduresin periodic drills) so that they may take appropriate actions * * *. (T)heNRC feels that such preparedness represents a prudent step which shouldbe taken in line with the NRC's philosophy of defense-in-depth * * *. (NUREG-1140,p. 112).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The accident assumptions employed in the proposed final rule areunrealistic and continue an unfortunate trend that I would hope we wouldsome day address_not only for fuel cycle facilities, but for reactor licenseesas well. This action will only make it more difficult if and when we getto the point of addressing the technical underpinning for our emergencyplanning requirements for nuclear power plants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The fact that we have already issued orders requiring major fuelcycle and materials licensees to have emergency plans in place is not,in my view, a sufficient justification for now promulgating a rule codifyingthose orders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The emergency plans required by the proposed rule would most likelybe ineffective against the most probable fast-breaking accidents for fuelfacilities. Because of the nature of such accidents, very little can bedone beyond the actions already in place for nonradiological emergencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Finally, the ACRS has expressed serious reservations about theneed for such a rule in light of the existing plans for the fuel cyclefacilities.</ITAG>Under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the EnergyReorganization Act of 1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 553, the NRC is proposingto adopt the following amendments to 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 30_RULES OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO DOMESTIC LICENSING OF BYPRODUCTMATERIAL</ITAG>1.

In andSection; 70.22, paragraph (i) is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 70.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contents of applications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(i)(1) Each application to possess enriched uranium or plutonium for whicha criticality accident alarm system is required, uranium hexafluoride inexcess of 50 kilograms in a single container or 1000 kilograms total, orin excess of 2 curies of plutonium in unsealed form or on foils or platedsources, must contain either: (i) An evaluation showing that the maximum dose to a member of the publicoffsite due to a release of radioactive materials would not exceed 1 remeffective dose equivalent or an intake of 2 milligrams of soluble uranium,or (ii) An emergency plan for responding to the radiological hazards of anaccidental release of special nuclear material and to any associated chemicalhazards directly incident thereto.(2) One or more of the following factors may be used to support an evaluationsubmitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section: (i) The radioactive material is physically separated so that only a portioncould be involved in an accident; (ii) All or part of the radioactive material is not subject to releaseduring an accident or to criticality because of the way it is stored orpackaged;(iii) In the case of fires or explosions, the release fraction would belower than 0.001 due to the chemical or physical form of the material;(iv) The solubility of the material released would reduce the dose received;(v) The facility design or engineered safety features in the facility wouldcause the release fraction to be lower than 0.001; (vi) Operating restrictions or procedures would prevent a release largeenough to cause a member of the public offsite to receive a dose exceeding1 rem effective dose equivalent; or (vii) Other factors appropriate for the specific facility. (3) Emergency plans submitted under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this sectionmust include the following information: (i) Facility description. A brief description of the licensee's facilityand area near the site. (ii) Types of accidents. An identification of each type of radioactivematerials accident for which protective actions may be needed.(iii) Classification of accidents. A classification system for classifyingaccidents as alerts or site area emergencies. (iv) Detection of accidents. Identification of the means of detecting eachtype of accident in a timely manner. (v) Mitigation of consequences. A brief description of the means and equipmentfor mitigating the consequences of each type of accident, including thoseprovided to protect workers onsite, and a description of the program formaintaining the equipment. (vi) Assessment of releases. A brief description of the methods and equipmentto assess releases of radioactive materials. (vii) Responsibilities. A brief description of the responsibilities oflicensee personnel should an accident occur, including identification ofpersonnel responsible for promptly notifying offsite response organizationsand the NRC; also responsibilities for developing, maintaining, and updatingthe plan. (viii) Notification and coordination. A commitment to and a brief descriptionof the means to promptly notify offsite response organizations and requestoffsite assistance, including medical assistance for the treatment of contaminatedinjured onsite workers when appropriate. A control point must be established.The notification and coordination must be planned so that unavailabilityof some personnel, parts of the facility, and some equipment will not preventthe notification and coordination. The licensee shall also commit to notifythe NRC operations center immediately after notification of the appropriateoffsite response organizations and not later than one hour after the licenseedeclares an emergency.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ These reporting requirements do not superceed or releaselicensees of complying with the requirements under the Emergency Planningand Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, Title III, Pub.

A brief description of the types ofinformation on facility status, radioactive releases, and recommended protectiveactions, if necessary, to be given to offsite response organizations andto the NRC. (x) Training. A brief description of the frequency, performance objectivesand plans for the training that the licensee will provide workers on howto respond to an emergency including any special instructions and orientationtours the licensee would offer to fire, police, medical and other emergencypersonnel. The training shall familiarize personnel with site-specificemergency procedures. Also, the training shall thoroughly prepare sitepersonnel for their responsibilities in the event of accident scenariospostulated as most probable for the specific site, including the use ofteam training for such scenarios. (xi) Safe shutdown. A brief description of the means of restoring the facilityto a safe condition after an accident. (xii) Exercises. Provisions for conducting quarterly communications checkswith offsite response organizations and biennial onsite exercises to testresponse to simulated emergencies. Quarterly communications checks withoffsite response organizations must include the check and update of allnecessary telephone numbers. The licensee shall invite offsite responseorganizations to participate in the biennial exercises. Participation ofoffsite response organizations in biennial exercises although recommendedis not required. Exercises must use accident scenarios postulated as mostprobable for the specific site and the scenarios shall not be known tomost exercise participants. The licensee shall critique each exercise usingindividuals not having direct implementation responsibility for the plan.Critiques of exercises must evaluate the appropriateness of the plan, emergencyprocedures, facilities, equipment, training of personnel, and overall effectivenessof the response. Deficiencies found by the critiques must be corrected.(xiii) Hazardous chemicals. A certification that the applicant has metits responsibilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct of 1986, Title III, Pub. L. 99-499, if applicable to the applicant'sactivities at the proposed place of use of the special nuclear material.(4) The licensee shall allow the offsite response organizations expectedto respond in case of an accident 60 days to comment on the licensee'semergency plan before submitting it to NRC. The licensee shall provideany comments received within the 60 days to the NRC with the emergencyplan. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 70.23</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]</ITAG>13.
