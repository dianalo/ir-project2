Democrat Gephardt pays up to $500,000 for commercials; rivals suspect he will overshoot the federally imposed spending limit for the state, although his advisers deny it. Dukakis and Simon also crowd the Iowa limit. Favorable recent news stories give Babbitt a surge of money; he nearly triples his TV budget to $170,000, and the typical Iowan is now seeing his ads five or six times a week. Almost everyone is likely to skirt the New Hampshire limit.    Among Republicans, Bush and Dole have already spent about half their national limits, with Dole spending heavily in Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Georgia, California and Washington and Bush concentrating money in Florida and Texas. Kemp is even more deeply in the red than previously admitted.    Gephardt's year-end financial report hasn't yet shown up at the Federal Election Commission. The campaign claims its only copy is lost in the mail.    SHAMIR EMERGES as the big winner in the new U.S. peace plan.    Despite heat from his own right wing, the Israeli prime minister reaps political benefits from the U.S. proposal for year-end negotiations on the occupied territories. After resisting rival Peres's call for international peace talks, Shamir now has his own peace plan to talk up in Israel's elections.    Peres, initially cool toward the U.S. plan, reverses course and tries to take some credit for it. But Shamir has little to lose. He bets that Jordan's King Hussein will take him off the hook by refusing to sign on to the proposal. In any event, few think the administration will achieve its goal; in a U.S. election year, there is little political will to hold Israel's feet to the fire.    ECONOMIC ATTENTION focuses on today's unemployment figures.    An upward trend in weekly jobless claims leads some to expect an increase today. With mixed signals from other recent indicators, the jobs numbers may provide the best clue about the economy's course. A surge in the number of jobs created -- even if accompanied by a small rise in the unemployment rate -- will signal continued growth. But a larger rise in joblessness may mean recession ahead.    The figures will also be crucial in the Fed's deliberations next week on whether to allow interest rates to drop further. The central bank is ready to ease, but a strong report could cause second thoughts. One Fed governor fears that the economy could contract in the first quarter, and some private economists agree. But exports and factory orders are still strong.    Reagan aides profess optimism. &quot;Some people say yes, we're going to have a recession around the corner,&quot; says one, &quot;but I don't buy that.&quot;    GETTING WARMER: Expecting a strong win in Iowa Monday, Dole plans to turn up the heat on Bush in New Hampshire in hopes of overtaking him there. Dole maps an ad barrage emphasizing his role in tackling Social Security problems and the INF treaty, contending that Bush hasn't played a role. Meanwhile, surrogates Rudman, Domenici and Kassebaum will attack Kemp on environmental and budget issues.    BORK'S REVENGE? The defeated Supreme Court nominee, whose resignation from the federal bench takes effect today, begins a lecture tour Monday at Grove City College, the Pennsylvania school involved in a 1984 Supreme Court decision limiting the reach of federal civil-rights laws. Congress is now trying to overturn the ruling.    GOP COMPLAINTS that Senate Democrats are stalling 27 judicial nominations are overblown. Of the 27 nominees, 10 weren't chosen by the White House until late December, as Congress was adjourning, and three more were chosen just a couple of weeks earlier.    TALK ABOUT bad days: In New York Wednesday, Energy Secretary Herrington confirmed erroneous rumors of a Soviet nuclear accident, got in the way of a trader trying to make a trade in the oil pit of the New York Merc, and ended the day by telling Merc brokers at a black-tie dinner to &quot;shut up.&quot;    A CRIPPLED PRESIDENCY seeks ways to recoup from the Contra loss.    White House officials say they will play up the vote as a campaign issue. &quot;This contributes to the impression the Democratic Party is not serious about the national defense,&quot; says Reagan aide Donatelli. But polls show Contra aid remains highly unpopular, and Reagan now must bank on new bad-faith moves by the Sandinistas to rescue his policy. Otherwise, he clearly lacks the clout to prevail in Congress.    Reagan's aides hope for some gain from his forthcoming foreign trips -- to Mexico next week, Europe in early March and Canada for the economic summit in June. Eagerness for a May summit in Moscow is palpable. Reagan is willing to go even if a new strategic-arms treaty isn't possible.    But the president would prefer at least a &quot;framework&quot; agreement that would let him claim a breakthrough.    MINOR MEMOS: Anne Cox Chambers, chairwoman of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, gives a fund-raiser for Democratic presidential candidate Gore -- and closes it to the press. . . . Robertson's campaign spending report shows payments to three men named Miracle. . . . Poindexter's lawyer invites &quot;fellow members of the white-collar criminal bar&quot; to a party &quot;in memory of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
