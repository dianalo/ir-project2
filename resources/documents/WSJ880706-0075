The new consolidated bank, which will begin operations Jan. 1 in Denver, will be authorized to provide a full line of financial services to agricultural cooperatives and rural utilities anywhere in the U.S. With a consolidated portfolio of $6.6 billion in loans outstanding, it will rank as the nation's 15th largest business lender, according to Jack Cassidy, a system spokesman.    The eight institutions whose stockholders voted Thursday to merge are the banks for cooperatives based in Baltimore; Columbia, S.C.; Louisville, Ky.; St. Louis; Omaha, Neb.; Wichita, Kan.; Austin, Texas; and Sacramento, Calif.    In releasing the results yesterday, Edward Breihan, a director of the Texas Bank for Cooperatives, called the vote &quot;a landmark in agricultural finance.&quot; The banks-for-cooperatives structure &quot;had remained essentially unaltered since the banks were established in 1933,&quot; he said.    The four banks for cooperatives voting to remain independent are based in Springfield, Mass.; Jackson, Miss.; St. Paul, Minn.; and Spokane, Wash. They will be able to compete with one another and the national bank for business nationwide.    The merger vote was required by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. In enacting a $4 billion bailout for the ailing Farm Credit System last December, Congress set deadlines for mergers among the system's 12 federal land banks, 12 federal intermediate credit banks and 12 banks for cooperatives. But it gave the institutions considerable latitude in choosing their merger partners. The lawmakers were intent on streamlining the system and cutting its high overhead costs.    Under the bailout law, the Denver-based Central Bank for Cooperatives, which is owned by the 12 banks for cooperatives, automatically will be included in the new institution, which will be called the National Bank for Cooperatives. The four banks remaining independent still will have the option of merging with another bank for cooperatives, with one of the land banks or with the national bank.    To be approved, the merger plan for the banks for cooperatives had to win the support of stockholders who own more than 50% of each bank's equity and a numerical majority of each bank's stockholders. The stockholders are borrowers who buy bank shares in lieu of paying lending fees.    Unlike some of the system's land banks, the banks for cooperatives weathered the farm depression of the 1980s fairly well, according to Joseph Terrell, a spokesman for the Farm Credit Council, the system's lobbying arm. Among other things, they finance agricultural exports and provide international banking services to farmer-owned cooperatives. </TEXT></DOC>
