(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A New View of OpenViewandM;EVERY VENDOR is taking great pains these days to prove that it is the mostopen and nonproprietary of all, and Hewlett-Packard (HP) is one of the mostaggressive in this regard.andP;  In the network management arena, HP has been veryactive in defining and redefining what it means to be a totally open providerof management software and products.andM;In its original OpenView announcement of March 1988, HP raised the discussionof management standardization to a new plane when it became the first vendorto articulate a platform strategy for network management systems.andP;  HP's majorpoint was that user interface integration was the critical goal in deliveringuseful multivendor network management and that the Open Systems Interconnect(OSI) standards were not yet addressing this goal.andP;  Different managementapplications written by various vendors should share a common look and feel.andO;After an operator learns to use this standard user interface, learning to usea new management application should be easy and intuitive.andM;Even more importantly, HP stressed that users don't want to open separatewindows to interact with each application.andP;  Basic management operationsshould be invokable from a single set of menus and a unified graphicalrepresentation of the network.andP;  HP reasoned that achieving this level ofintegration requires writing all application software in a standarddevelopment environment and executing it on a common platform.andM;With the first release of OpenView, HP introduced such a platform.andP;  HP's OpenView Windows system defined a set of APIs (application program interfaces)which allowed application developers to write software that interacted withHP-provided routines that maintained a general dynamic status map for thenetwork.andP;  This user interface software also provided a standard menu layoutand a method by which applications could add menu entries.andP;  The OpenViewenvironment also offered common data management routines and facilities forstatus monitoring.andP;  As the name implied, OpenView was an open approach tomanagement systems, in which all the APIs were published and any vendor couldwrite software for the new platform.andP;  In fact, the first product deliverablewas a developer's kit that allowed other vendors, system integrators, ornetwork operators to begin writing software to execute in this standardrun-time environment.andM;The platform approach was a fresh idea at a time (early 1988) when theprimary debate concerned which protocols were best for collecting managementdata on an integrated manager.andP;  Protocol standardization had previouslyframed the debate on openness.andP;  IBM was insisting that SNA's managementsubset, called Network Management Vector Transport (NMVT), was the bestenterprise management standard and already a de facto standard.andP;  ATandamp;T wasadvocating the nascent OSI protocol called Common Management InformationProtocol (CMIP).andP;  Meanwhile, the TCP community was experimenting withsomething called the Simple Gateway Management Protocol (SGMP, which laterbecame SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol).andM;HP concluded that it would be necessary to support all of these protocols,although it threw its weight behind the OSI effort in line with a generalcorporate commitment to OSI.andP;  HP's insight, however, was that standardsefforts were not dealing with the need for a standard user interface fornetwork management.andP;  Even if all vendors adopted a single protocol standard,users would not get a coherent set of applications for managing complex,heterogeneous multivendor environments.andM;Platforms versus HierarchiesandM;The platform approach to integrated management offers the possibility of agreater degree of multivendor integration than the other major approach, themanager of managers scheme (see Illustration 1).andP;  In the manager of managersarchitecture, interactions among management systems from different vendorsare accomplished through a standardized protocol interface and a standardizedset of management data definitions.andP;  This hierarchical way of aggregatingmanagement information requires that a single vendor (the provider of theintegrated manager) develop all the multivendor network managementapplication software.andP;  Other vendors merely provide raw data to theintegrated manager through open interfaces.andM;In today's practice, only a few applications exist on the integrated manager,so most functionality is obtained through windowed access to device managerapplications, which is hardly integration.andP;  Moreover, this approachmultiplies management systems at a time when operations centers are lookingto reduce the number of management systems they use.andM;In the platform strategy, the eventual goal is to develop a single managementsystem that can handle a diverse, multivendor network.andP;  Rather than do it allalone, the platform vendor creates an open development environment in whichmultiple vendors can write software that shares common user views and acommon data repository.andP;  If the platform offers a rich set of services andadvanced capabilities, such as an object-oriented user interface or arelational DBMS (RDBMS), many vendors may find implementing their managementsoftware on such a platform more attractive than developing their own base atconsiderable cost and risk.andM;The advantage of the manager of managers approach is that it builds onexisting management systems.andP;  The platform strategy in its pure form requireswriting all new management software.andP;  In practice, the two approaches can becombined, if necessary.andP;  But the platform strategy aims at reducing thenumber of management systems, which is highly appealing to network owners.andO;the manager of managers approach, on the other hand, is necessary to preservean installed base of management systems.andP;  Thus, it is not surprising that itschief promoter is ATandamp;T, which has a huge investment in public and privatemanagement systems.andP;  The platform concept is most appealing when all newsoftware has to be written anyway.andP;  Thus, it is flowering in the area of LANand internet management, where there is a dearth of good management software.andO;HP, Digital Equipment Corporation, 3Com, and Sun are now all pursuingplatform strategies targeted at this problem.andM;The other argument against the proprietary manager of managers solution tomultivendor network management is that no single vendor can meet all themanagement application needs of a large enterprise.andP;  With the platformapproach, many vendors can simultaneously work on management software thatwill all play together.andP;  If a particular platform achieves a critical mass ofimportant applications, then there is a good chance that users will chooseit, since applications are what users really want.andP;  If the users start buyinga particular platform, then more application software developers will want towrite for that platform because the market for their creations will be large.andO;A snowball effect develops, and the winning platform is unstoppable.andP;  Ofcourse, the best example of such a phenomenon is the IBM PC running MS-DOS.andO;Whether such a clear market standard will emerge for network management isstill far from certain, but the major platform providers hope it will.andM;Good Idea, Wrong ImplementationandM;So, back in March 1988, HP was really onto something.andP;  The problem was itsfirst implementation of the platform concept.andP;  Aiming at LAN management, HPdecided that the solution had to be inexpensive and thus chose to implementOpenView on MS-DOS PCs.andP;  But DOS is simply too primitive to be a generalpurpose network management platform.andP;  With memory constraints and nomultitasking, it is far too limited to serve as a base for combining multipleapplications from many vendors.andP;  The small screen size and low resolution ofits graphics also make DOS a poor choice for displaying the large amount ofinformation generated by complex networks.andP;  The Unix workstation has clearlybecome the norm for advanced management applications, with Sun workstationsthe most popular to date.andP;  Moreover, the DOS OpenView was short onapplication support in areas such as management protocols, none of which wereincluded with the product.andM;It's not surprising, therefore, that only a few vendors, most notablyCabletron, implemented management products on the DOS version of HP'sOpenView.andP;  HP itself made only limited use of the DOS OpenView inapplications for managing terminal servers, bridges, and circuit monitors.andO;HP claims, however, that several customers have made major use of theproduct.andM;Although HP started the public discussion of management platforms, it did notremain the only vendor to implement this strategy for long.andP;  In August 1988,Digital announced its VMS-based platform for network and system management,the EMA (Enterprise Management Architecture) Director, that was far moreambitious and sophisticated than HP's DOS-based platform.andP;  Digital couldcount on serious support from vendors such as Vitalink, StrateCom, Siemens,and Codex, white Hewlett-Packard still searched for OpenView supporters.andM;Meanwhile, the argument in the TCP community over whether to use OSI's CMIPor SNMP to manage LANs and internets was escalating into a full-fledgeddebate.andP;  HP allied itself with the CMIP over TCP (CMOT) camp.andP;  At the October1989 Interop Conference, the SNMP advocates demonstrated many workingversions of sNMP, while only two or three CMOT demos were visible.andP;  By theend of the show, everyone was declaring SNMP the winner.andP;  OSI was dead forLAN and internet management.andP;  Bad news for pro-OSI HP, which did, in fact,participate in the Interop SNMP demo.andM;To make matters worse, at Interop '89, Sun brought out its managementplatform, SunNet Manager, and attracted a great deal of attention.andP;  It, too,featured a shared graphical user interface which, in contrast to HP's, madefull use of the high-resolution graphics of the Sun workstation.andP;  SunNetManager used Sun's RPC mechanism to create a distributed management system inwhich pieces of management software could reside on different workstations.andO;SunNet Manager bypassed OSI CMIP and implemented SNMP and Digital's Phase IVDECnet management protocol, NICE.andP;  Sun-written agents used the RPC method topassing data to an operator station, using internal management data formats.andM;With so many vendors using the Sun workstation for their management softwareanyway, it seemed that many would choose to use the additional features ofSunNet Manager to improve the look and feel of their management applicationsand to provide a modicum of integration with others using the same platform.andO;A number of important vendors such as Synoptics and Network Generalimmediately endorsed SunNet Manager and demonstrated some compatibility atInterop '89.andP;  Even Cabletron, HP's premier OpenView implementer, hedged itsbets and came out with a package on Sun's platform, too.andP;  OpenView was nottaking the industry by storm.andM;OpenView TwoandM;In January 1990, HP responded to these problems with an expanded definitionof the OpenView architecture and a new implementation of it on a Unix base.andO;Although completely faithful to the original goals and concepts of OpenView,the new announcements rejuvenate the strategy.andP;  They shift HP's platform toworkstations and servers running Unix.andP;  The new OpenView architecture createsa distributed, object-oriented application environment for managementsoftware that closely resembles Digital's EMA in form and function, althoughthe two differ significantly in the way they are implemented.andM;HP's expanded OpenView Network Management ARchitecture (OpenView NMA) isderived from the OSI management architecture and makes heavy use of ISO'sCommon Management Information Service (CMIS) standard.andP;  HP's OpenView NMAanticipates a widespread acceptance of OSI management, although, as we willsee, it makes short-term concessions to other managmenet standards such asSNMP.andM;HP's OpenView NMA expands considerably, however, on the basic OSIarchitecture as shown in Illustration 2.andP;  The OSI System Management Model isvery simple, specifying two architectural elements, a manager and an agent,that communicate using CMIP.andP;  Communication between the agent and the actualmanaged object is not subject to standardization by OSI and can use anymechanism that is appropriate to the nature of the managed object.andM;HP first expands the manager component into two pieces, the managementapplication and a common user interface.andP;  This separation provides anadditional point of integration so that several applications can interactwith a single user display.andP;  At the same time, HP also expands the agent intoa more general management services component that includes the mechanisms forinteracting with managed objects.andP;  These expansions on the OSI model,summarized in the middle diagram in Illustration 2, roughly represent thearchitecture of DOS OpenView.andM;With the new announcements, HP improves upon these ideas in three key ways(see the right-hand diagram in Illustration 2).andP;  First, the OpenView NMAdefines a distributed communication infrastructure that allows the pieces ofthe architecture to be spread across multiple machines as needed.andP;  Second,OpenView NMA further decomposes management applications into commonmanagement services acting on managed objects and a much reduced managementapplication.andP;  The goal is to apply the object-oriented approach tostructuring manager functionality in much the same way that it is used tostructure agent functionality.andP;  In this model, management services modulesprovide functions to other components of the system in the form ofinformation, actions, and events defined for new kinds of managed objects.andO;In other words, common management services are abstracted as manager objects,which can be accessed as easily as network objects.andP;  Some manager objects,such as an internet, will be logical groups of objects (there is no physicalnetwork element that can respond to queries directed at the entire internet).andO;Other manager objects will be aggregations of management information, such asa log file or a certain kind of report.andP;  By using object-oriented approaches,HP hopes to make management functionality more modular and reusable.andP;  Bydefining management services as objects, it should be easier to combine themin a variety of higher-level applications.andM;The final expansion of the OSI model introduces the concept of an objectmanager.andP;  Object managers are integral components of the architecture thatuse the communication infrastructure to provide management services formanaged objects in the network to other components of the system.andP;  Objectmanagers may use a variety of protocols to interact with the actual networkelements represented by these managed objects.andP;  In essense, the objectmanager makes the managed network resources conform to the objectspecification used within OpenView, even if the resource doesn't implementand object-oriented protocol like CMIP.andP;  Object managers are the close analogof access modules in Digital's Director architecture.andM;In summary, the OpenView NMA decomposes the network management problem intoobject managers, management applications, and a graphical user interface, allintegrated through a distributed communications infrastructure.andM;The Network Management ServerandM;These architectural concepts are realized in the design of HP's new OpenViewNetwork Management Server.andP;  The NM Server design is shown in Illustration 3and, for obvious reasons, is known within HP as the Backward C.andP;  The serverimplements a standard set of managmeent APIs that let management applicationsbe distributed across multiple servers, and it provides these applicationswith common services for data management, access to managed objects, andpresentation.andP;  It comprises five major components: Presentation Services,Data Management Services, Event Management Services, CommunicationsProtocols, and the Distributed Communication Infrastructure.andM;PRESENTATION SERVICES.andP;  Presentation Services implements the user interface.andO;The server will support the X11 and OSF/Motif standards, which provide awindowing graphical user interface.andP;  The OpenView Windows dynamic network mapinterface from the DOS OpenView is implemented on the server as well.andP;  TheUnix version closely preserves the look and feel of the DOS version,underscoring HP's commitment to it as a standard for network management.andP;  HPprobably had to do this to avoid appearing fickle and to make portingapplications from the DOS version to Unix easier, but the interface could usejazzing up.andP;  The HP OpenView Windows display does not demo as well as userinterface displays from ATandamp;T and Sun.andM;The OpenView Windows user interface is well organized, logical, andextensible, however.andP;  The OpenView Windows map is made up of a collection ofpictures.andP;  A picture is a collection of symbols that represent networkdevices.andP;  Usually, a picture would represent the collection of devices on asingle LAN.andP;  On the top-level map display, a picture is represented by anicon.andP;  Picture icons are linked together on the map using subnet symbols.andO;There can be multiple, independent maps.andP;  OpenView Windows providesfacilities for editing maps and pictures.andP;  The multilevel display capabilityof maps and pictures helps to handle the large number of devices in a biginternet.andP;  The X11 implementation makes it possible for multiple operators toshare a common map display by running off of X terminals sharing a LAN withthe NM Server.andM;DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICES.andP;  Data Management Services implements a common,shared data store for all applications and management services on the server.andO;Access to stored data is through a set of APIs that protect developers fromdependence on the actual physical structure of the database.andP;  The server'sData Manager stores and retrieves all data in object form, i.e., as instancesof defined object classes.andP;  In fact, the APIs in the NM Server provide theset of services defined by the ISO CMIS standard.andM;As part of the developer's kit, HP will provide a Metadata compiler thatenables users and developers to define new object classes or extensions toexisting object classes.andP;  Object classes, attributes, actions, and events aredefined using templates that can be compiled into ISO ASN.1 notation, as isdone in the OSI management standards.andP;  Unlike Digital, which has chosen todefine its own proprietary language for object definition, HP is strictlyadhering to the OSI management standards in its approach to networkmanagement.andM;References to stored data can make use of the scoping and filteringmechanisms defined in CMIP/CMIS that allow for the selection of multipleobject instances in a single reference.andP;  By making its API conform to CMIS,HP makes it possible for applications to retrieve information from thenetwork or the database using the same syntax.andM;The actual database delivered with the server is specially engineered to meetthe performance requirements of real-time network management.andP;  HP willprovide a facility for exporting data from the database to an SQL-compatibleRDBMS.andM;Although HP's Data Manager is a good first start, it does have somelimitations.andP;  It can store the latest instance data about an object, but doesnot yet have the machinery to support storing a time series of data, as isfound in the repository in Digitalhs EMA Director.andP;  (HP says that it isworking on this feature and that it will definitely appear in a subsequentrelease.)andP;  On the other hand, HP's NM Server is ahed of Sun's SunNet Manager,which does not yet offer any common data repository services.andM;EVENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES.andP;  Event Management Services routes and logs eventsgenerated by network objects or other server components.andP;  Using theseservices, applications can request receipt of specific events by registeringone or more event sieves.andP;  Event Sieve Managers determine which other servernodes should receive copies of particular events, and they also route eventsto registered applications.andP;  Routing of events across servers is controlledby a distribution list, which is a simple ASCII file that must be editedmanually by operations administrators.andP;  This seems like a poor design thatmakes event routing a special case, rather than integrating it with otherserver configuration data.andM;COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS.andP;  The Communication Protocols component implementscommunication between the server and managed objects.andP;  HP's first release ofthe server supports SNMP and CMOT.andP;  Interestingly, it will not support realCMIP, presumably because there are no managed objects that implement CMIPover a full OSI stack.andP;  HP's implementation of SNMP has some built-infeatures, such as automatic retry of requests hat time out, and access toaggregate objects without having to make repeated &quot;get&quot; requests.andP;  HP plansto include full CMIP in the server once the OSI Network Management Forum(OSI/NMF) finishes specifying its first full Management Information Base(MIB) later this year and other vendors start implementing the OSI managementprotocol interface.andM;DISTRIBUTED COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE.andP;  The Distributed CommunicationInfrastructure is the key server building block that implements theintermodule communication mechanism allowing pieces of the server to resideon different machines.andP;  The communication infrastructure defines a standardAPI that provides the services defined by ISO's CMIS, which is the heart ofthe server's object-oriented approach to network management.andM;Applications and object managers refer to object classes and instances intheir calls to the Server, and the communication infrastructure maps these tonetwork addresses and choices of management protocol (today, SNMP or CMOT)for accessing the managed object.andP;  Illustration 4 shows more of the internaldetail of the infrastructure.andP;  The key compoennt is the Postmaster, whichlocates specific objects, chooses which protocols to use, and establishedmanagement associations.andM;The goal of these APIs is to shield applications from knowing the location ofthe objects they are manipulating or the protocols being used.andP;  HP has alwayshoped it could develop a single set of applications that would work for TCPand OSI environments.andP;  However, an inspection of the API calls shows thatapplication developers do need to know if they are using SNMP, since only asubset of the calls can work over SNMP.andP;  Nonetheless, the use of a CMIS APIas the OpenView standard does suggest an easier migration to standard OSImanagement for applications that are written to work with SNMP today.andM;Although the communication infrastructure API separates location informationfrom applications, this information is still needed at runtime.andP;  It issupplied through what HP calls Local Registration Files (LRF).andP;  Similar toevent distribution lists, LRFs seem like primitive mechanisms, which will beprone to error and additional configuration confusion.andP;  Location informationshould be obtained through a general directory service shared by othernetwork applications.andP;  Again, Digital's EMA Director is able to use Digital'sDistributed Name Service (DNS) for this purpose.andP;  HP recognizes thisshortcoming but is waiting for a general product line solution to directoryservice that will make use of X.500 and products like Apollo Computer'sLocation Broker.andM;The major strength of the server's design is that all components interactthrough the Distributed Communication Infrastructure.andP;  This allows forflexible distribution of management components (see Illustration 5).andP;  Bytaking a distributed approach to the server design, HP can create specializedmanagement stations for particular users or functions.andP;  Operators could usediskless workstations or X temrinals to interact with one or more serverswith databases.andP;  This architecture also allows HP's management solution toscale effectively and support needs of different constituencies within theenterprise.andP;  This distributed philosophy toward network and system managementhas been adopted by Sun, Digital,a nd 3Com also, but what makes HP's approachunique is its use of the CMIS-like API rather than a lower level RPC ordistributed file service mechanism.andP;  The CMIS interface enforces an objectorientation on applications for the NM server and meshes well with the ISOand OSI/NM Forum efforts to define standard objects for networks andmanagement systems.andP;  But the HP implementation of the interface is limitedand appears to constrain the degree of component distribution.andP;  For example,the OpenView Windows user interface has a separate set of APIs that do not gothrough the CMIS interconnect.andP;  This means that applications that drive a mapdisplay must reside on the same server as the display they are driving.andP;  HPsays that this is a limitation of the current implementation but not anarchitectural flaw.andP;  The OpenView Windows API is general and can implement adistributed communication mechanism at some point in the future.andM;HP's goal with the Backward C is to insulate applications from changes in keypresentation, database, and communication technologies.andP;  HP developers talkabout sheltering the applications and preventing them from escaping theBackward C.andP;  HP is betting on the long-term stability of the ISO CMISinterface and the fact that vendors and users alike will be attracted to theopen and nonproprietary nature of the interface.andP;  In contrast, the APIs inDigital's EMA Director are entirely unique to Digital and make use ofproprietary Digital technology, such as its own version of RPC.andP;  HP says ithas neither the time nor the resources to reinvent the wheel and is happy touse the results of the hard work of the OSI management standards committees.andM;An Offer You Can't RefuseandM;The server is being sold to operate on HP9000 workstations running HP-UX(HP's version of Unix) with at least 8MB of memory.andP;  Server hardwareconfigurations will range from a low of $15,000 to high-end configurationstopping $100,000.andP;  Users can expect a typical configuration to cost at least$25,000.andP;  HP is recommending HP700/X terminals connected with a workstationserver over a LAN for operator stations.andM;HP is pricing the server software very aggressively.andP;  A developer's licensewill be $25,000, while each end-user server software license will be only$5,000.andP;  Separate licenses are not needed for the software that would run onindividual X terminals.andP;  It is actually amazing that HP has announced adefinite price for the product fully six months before delivery (availabilityis projected for mid-1990).andP;  The low end-user cost indicates HP's OEMaspirations for the product, and even the developer license is paltrycompared to most other management systems on the market.andP;  Users who areplanning to write custom management applications will find the priceattractive.andM;HP, The Full-Service SupplierandM;Although the NM Server is the foundation for future HP network managementsoftware, HP already has a large array of network and system managementproducts to offer its customers.andP;  These include products to manage bridges,terminal servers, HP9000 and 3000 systems, Apollo workstation configurations,X.25 packet nets, and data circuits.andM;A new product offering, announced at the same time as the NM Server, is theHP OpenView Network Node Manager, which uses SNMP to monitor TCP/IP networks.andO;It offers a graphical network map that the product builds automatically bydiscovering nodes on the TCP/IP internet.andP;  Node Manager runs under HP-UX onHP9000 but, as of now, doesn't use the NM Server architecture.andP;  However, therelease of this product does have a point.andP;  HP is embracing the de facto SNMPstandard and does not want to be branded an outsider to SNMP.andM;One problem with the existing HP management products is that they do notadhere to the new NMA.andP;  There is no presently defined or implementedmechanism by which products implemented under the older DOS version ofOpenView can communicate with the new NM Server.andP;  Even though the new NodeManager application runs on the same OS and hardware as the server, it doesnot make use of the server APIs.andP;  HP has a grand vision of how to writenetwork management software, but it has changed that vision once in the pasttwo years in moving from DOS to Unix.andP;  Will the vision change again?andM;HP is also known, of course, for its analyzers and testers for wide area andlocal area networks.andP;  HP's strength in test and measurement is surely anasset in its bid to be a full supplier to multivendor network managementneeds.andP;  HP is already working to network its testers and analyzers and maketheir data accessible through PC- and workstation-based user interfaces basedon OpenView Windows.andM;HP complemented its strength in this area when it acquired EON's LanProbe inlate 1988.andP;  LanProbe is a LAN analysis tool that allows detailed testing andtraffic analysis of remote Ethernet segments.andP;  The problem with traditionalanalyzers is that you have to take them to the LAN to be tested, plug themin, and work with them there.andP;  They are also too expensive (at least $10,000each) to dedicate one to every LAN segment on a full-time basis.andP;  LanProbe issimilar to a LAN analyzer, but it is set up to be used remotely from softwareon a PC.andP;  The analyzer piece, called the LanProbe segment monitor, isattached directly to an Ethernet.andP;  There, it monitors all frames on the LANand relays the information it collects to the centralized Probe View softwareover dial-up or dedicated line connections.andP;  Connection over the Ethernetitself is also possible (see Illustration 6).andP;  The LanProbe has no screen orkeyboard, making it less expensive than a full analyzer (about $5,000), andyou can consider putting one on key Ethernet segments.andM;If the Node Locator option is also purchased, ProbeView can determine actuallocation of each node on the Ethernet cable.andP;  The cable test option canpinpoint breaks, shorts, and faulty termination to within 10 feet of positionon the cable.andP;  The traffic and frame monitoring functions allow you tomeasure what's going on your Ethernet without bogging down bridges or routerswith detailed statistics collection.andP;  You can expect that this type ofsolution to LAN management will quickly grow in popularity and will beprovided by other vendors soon.andP;  With performance demands on bridges androuters increasing steadily as LANs increase in usage and raw bandwidth, thededicated LAN monitor becomes a better way to get fine data on LAN trafficpatterns, collisions, and performance.andM;The Key to Long-Term SuccessandM;Although HP has some neat technology, it also understands that, in the longrun, all vendors will have the same basic technological capabilities.andP;  Asstandardization of network management interfaces progresses, any vendor willbe able to manage any other vendor's equipment.andP;  HP believes that service andsupport will be the real long-term differentiators, and it has been devotingconsiderable effort to building a world class network service and supportorganization.andP;  HP's Network Support Program offers worldwide planning,implementation, maintenance, and operations assistance for multivendor LANsand WANs.andP;  HP provides these services through three Customer Network Centersin Atlanta, Bristol (England), and Singapore.andP;  These centers manage HP'sinternal TCP/IP internet and leverage HP's many years of experience inoperating one of the world's largest private internets.andP;  HP has entered intoagreements with leading vendors (most notably cisco, 3Com, and Novell) to bean authorized service and support provider for their products.andP;  HP offersturnkey operations support and specialized integration services.andM;Looking toandM;the FutureandM;HP has a very clear and focused goal.andP;  It states explicitly that it wants tobe the best at managing TCP and OSI environments.andP;  To achieve this goal, ithas been pursuing an aggressive strategy of standards activity (HP was afounding member of the OSI Network Management Forum), acquisition (EON andApollo), technology development (the NM Server and other OpenView products),and service and support.andP;  HP has major strengths in managing TCP/IP internetsand other LAN-based network architectures.andP;  Its reputation and products intesting and measurement are also significant assets.andP;  HP is also a leader inMAP and other OSI-based network approaches.andM;Perhaps its biggest strength, however, is its business focus, something oftenlacking in the computer industry.andP;  Rather than go after the total enterprisenetwork management problem, HP is concentrating on the piece of the problemthat it understands best, LANs and internets.andP;  HP does not purport to be achoice for managing large SNA networks or voice systems.andP;  But, in our view,LANs and internets are where the new growth in networks will occur, and HP istargeting the new, strategic future systems, rather than the muddle of theinstalled base.andP;  What is more, LANs are today's quintessential multivendorenvironments.andP;  Enterprises need true multivendor management solutions formanaging their LAN-based internets today, not some promise of future OSIutopia, and HP wants to be there first with such a solution.andM;HP's biggest obstacle in achieving its goal is the fragmented and sparseinstalled base from which it starts.andP;  As the largest of the second tierplayers in the computer industry, it must go for the new types of networksrather than try to capture existing ones.andP;  The original OpenView product onDOS attraced few followers, and HP still can't point to many privateenterprises that have adopted the OpenView architecture as their networkmanagement strategy.andM;HP's strategy and architecture most closely resemble those of Digital.andP;  Bothhave up-to-date distributed management platforms aimed at managingmultivendor networks.andP;  Digital's Director platform is much more complete andsophisticated, however, largely due to its use of the full repertoire ofDigital's distributed system services, such as the distributed name serviceand distributed time service.andP;  Digital's object-oriented repository in theDirector also exceeds the capabilities of HP's Data Manager in such areas asthe storage of a time series of data and real-time enrollment of new objectdefinitions.andP;  The accomplish this, Digital has had to define its ownManagement Specification Language (MSL), however.andM;By basing its network management architecture on these proprietary mechanismsand its own VMS operating system, Digital also opens itself up to competitorclaims that EMA is another vendor lock-in play.andP;  HP, on the other hand, hasbased its architecture on a more vanilla, albeit less functional, Unix baseand on industry standards such as OSF/Motif, ASN.1, and CMIS/CMIP.andP;  HP alsofinds, however, that its commitment to standards is forcing it to wait forcertain features, such as a directory service, until the OSI standards firmup a little more.andM;The most important distinction between these two champions of distributedsystems is their approach to new development.andP;  Digital has been at work onEMA for over three years now, while HP's NM Server architecture is only abouthalf that old.andP;  Amazingly, HP will put out the first release of the NM Serverabout six months before Digital can get out the first release of theDirector.andP;  Of course, in Silicon Valley, they don't do anything that takeslonger than two years since everything changes so quickly.andP;  HP says that therapid introduction of the NM Server is due in large part to the way it hasleveraged the work of the standards groups in adopting CMIS and OSI objecttemplates as the standard APIs in the system.andP;  No wonder it is taking Digitallonger; it is reinventing much of the managmeent wheel.andP;  Time-to-market isvery important if you are trying to establish your platform as something ofan industry standard.andM;Don't forget, however, that as Digital rolls out the Director at the end of1990, it will have support from key vendors such as Vitalink, Stratacom,3Com, Siemens, and Codex.andP;  Hewlett-Packard can point to potential supportonly from Hughes Network Systems, Cabletron, and Microtronix, and even thesecommitments appear tentative.andP;  Sun already has more adherents to itsplatform, SunNet Manager, even though it is flimsy compared to whatHewlett-Packard is building.andM;HP's aggressive pricing and the overall simplicity of the NM Server may soonattract new followers, however.andP;  The server does support a graphical mapdisplay as the primary user interface, something Digital says won't be in thefirst release of the Director.andP;  Graphical user interface is an importantselling point for network management systems, and the exisence of one on theHP OpenView NM Server could be a key selling point.andP;  Could it be thatHewlett-Packad will beat Digital to the punch on multivendor networkmanagement?andM;HP is the dark horse in the network management competition.andP;  Digital, Sun,and IBM keep their eyes on HP and have reason to worry about the coherenceand vision of the HP strategy.andP;  HP is pushing openness to the limit and ispositioning itself as the champion of the multivendor solution.andP;  HP's newarchitecture and server, aggressively priced as it is, could attractimportant new supporters over the next year.andP;  If so, HP will have put anotherimportant piece in place in its overall plan to manage the advanced LAN-basedinternets that will be the basis of the distributed applications of the1990s.andM;James Herman writes, teaches, and consults on network management.andP;
