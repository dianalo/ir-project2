Bids to launch the satellite, called Palapa B-4, have comefrom China, the U.S. and France, but the competition has beenmainly between the first two.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, many observers believed China, which hasoffered the lowest price, would win. Such a move would cementJakarta and Beijing's rapprochement, initiated last yearafter nearly a quarter-century of diplomatic chill. Buttelecommunications-industry executives now say McDonnellDouglas Corp., whose Delta rockets have launched most ofIndonesia's past satellites, is best-positioned to get thenod.   The U.S. company's bid has been strengthened by itsperceived ability to launch sooner and keep B-4 operatinglonger than China could with its Long March rocket. Takingthese factors into account, senior advisers to PresidentSuharto now view St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas as cheaperin the long run. The president will make the final decision.   &quot;It's not an easy decision. There are so manyconsiderations and all factors will be weighed in,&quot; agovernment official says. He won't speculate on who will win,but he indirectly indicates a preference. &quot;The launch shouldbe by March or April 1992,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;It's veryimportant for our country.&quot;   Industry sources following the competition say theybelieve only McDonnell Douglas can guarantee a launch asearly as April 1992. Jean-Pierre Choubrac, who represents theFrench-led Arianespace in Jakarta, says Ariane could launchby mid-May 1992 and adds that he doesn't see how McDonnellDouglas could do it any earlier. A Chinese Embassy officialin Indonesia says China Great Wall Industries could put B-4up 20 months after a contract is signed. That would be latein 1992 at the earliest, though Indonesian officials assumeit could be well into 1993 before China could launch.   Whatever dates the competitors can meet, senior Indonesianofficials weighing the issue are believed to have concludedthat a U.S. launch would be quickest, and they putsubstantial emphasis on this point.   The B-4 satellite is currently being built by LosAngeles-based Hughes Aircraft Co., the unit of General MotorsCo. that has made all of Indonesia's satellites. Its cost is$54 million, while total cost of the launch -- includinginsurance -- is likely to top $110 million.   The competition to launch B-4 has proceeded without theheat and intensity that marked a battle in 1989 and 1990between foreign consortiums to supply Indonesia with digitaltelephone-switching equipment. But as in that case, Indonesiahas been in the enviable position of being able to getbidders eager for the contract to make increasinglyattractive offers.   &quot;Whoever wins will get a substantially lower price thanwanted,&quot; says an industry analyst. &quot;But they'll still be veryhappy to get the job.&quot;   According to government officials following thecompetition, President Suharto is weighing political factors-- which tend to favor China -- against several practicalconsiderations that don't favor it. The practical points arelinked to Indonesia's ability to ensure continuation of itsstrategic position dominating Southeast Asian satellitecommunications -- a position that might be eventuallychallenged by other nations if Jakarta's next launch isdelayed too long.   There is growing demand in Indonesia and the region forthe kind of communications the B-4 provides. Each of the twoPalapa satellites currently in use has 24 channels; nearlyall 48 are booked, though a few aren't currently in use.About 80% of the satellite channels are used domestically,but Indonesia also sells time to Thailand, Malaysia and thePhilippines. Palapa B-4, with another 24 channels, shouldprove a good source of revenue as each can be leased for atleast $1 million a year. The sooner the launch, the soonerIndonesia starts collecting revenue.</TEXT></DOC>
