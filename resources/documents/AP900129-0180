Cheers of ``Go Niners!'' were drowned out by the blaring ofthousands of red plastic horns as 75,000 fans paid tribute toquarterback Joe Montana, coach George Seifert, team owner EddieDeBartolo and other players riding in flashy convertibles.   Office workers leaned out of windows to watch, and some sentshowers of paper down on the parade, which began near thewaterfront and continued for about a mile along Market Street.   Fans, many sporting the team colors of red and gold, arrived upto two hours early to claim spots in front or perches on lamp postsor newspaper racks.   ``There's no team in the NFL that can beat us,'' said WayneRayburn of Sausalito, wearing a pair of 49ers boxer shorts over hisjeans to complement his official National Footbal League teamjacket.   ``If I wore them under my jeans you wouldn't be able to seethem,'' he said.   Rayburn, crouching on a concrete garbage can, vowed to claim thesame spot and wear the same shorts again at next year's Super Bowlvictory parade. Like other fans, he predicted the 49ers would winan unprecedented third consecutive NFL championship.   ``Threepeat next year!'' he said.   The parade followed the 49ers' easy win Sunday over the Broncosin New Orleans. It was San Francisco's fourth Super Bowl victory innine years and the second in a row.   The 55-10 score was the largest margin in 24 Super Bowls, butsome fans who expected an easy Niners victory regretted the scorewasn't even more lopsided.   ``I wish we could have had at least 75 points,'' Rayburn said.   Domonic Johnson of Walnut Creek begrudged Denver anything on thescoreboard.   ``I predicted the game at 55-0, but they did score thosepoints,'' Johnson said while waiting for the parade. ``I guess itdid keep it from getting too boring for some people.''   Fans waved banners, clutched red and gold balloons and heldsmall children high for a clear view of the parade led byDeBartolo, Mayor Art Agnos and Seifert, who displayed the goldSuper Bowl trophy to the roaring crowd.   They were followed by Montana, who passed for five touchdownsand earned his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award. Thequarterback and his wife, Jennifer, waved as they rode with theirthree small children in the back of a red convertible.</TEXT></DOC>
