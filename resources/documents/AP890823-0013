The nation's 2,934 Sandamp;Ls lost $3.7 billion in the April-Junequarter, up from $3.5 billion in the first three months of the year,the Office of Thrift Supervision said Tuesday. It was the biggestloss since the record $4.1 billion loss in the second quarter of1988.   The latest discouraging report came just two weeks afterPresident Bush signed legislation authorizing $50 billion to closeor sell failed institutions over the next 26 months.   During the six months leading up to the bill's approval,administration officials repeatedly said they believed $50 billionwould be adequate, although they couldn't guarantee it.   Now, regulators' statements indicate that private analystsprobably are right in predicting the administration will have tocome back to Congress for more money.   David C. Cooke, executive director of the Resolution Trust Corp.,the new agency charged with the cleanup, said Tuesday the $50billion won't cover much more than 500 failed Sandamp;Ls. The agency nowhas 264 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in its control after closing seven this month.   ``If it gets up to 500, it will probably be awfully tight. I cantell you that,'' Cooke told reporters at a luncheon. ``Our best hopeis ... (it will be) a little more than 400.''   Meanwhile, James R. Barth, chief economist of the Office ofThrift Supervision, which regulates the industry, said at a newsconference that he expects ``upwards of 600'' failed Sandamp;Ls willeventually be transferred from his jurisdiction to Cooke's agency.   Barth said 401 institutions already were insolvent at the end ofJune, up from 394 three months earlier.   He estimated another 1,200 Sandamp;Ls don't meet stricter standards inthe bill requiring institutions to have more capital as a bufferbetween losses and the Sandamp;L insurance fund. Many of those willsurvive by shrinking, retaining profits or attracting outsideinvestors, but others won't.   ``Are there circumstances under which the $50 billion isenough?'' Barth asked in a telephone interview. ``It's possibleunder very favorable circumstances. But, any sort of adversecircumstances make it increasingly likely that additional funds willhave to be found to deal with insolvent institutions.''   For the first half of this year, losses were mounting at a ratethat could make 1989 the worst year for the savings industry sincethe Depression, topping 1988's record of $13.4 billion.   Most of the loss this year is attributed to recognition ofproblems with loans that started going sour long ago. But privateanalysts point out that for the first time since last year'sJanuary-March quarter, the thrift industry is failing to make aprofit on current operations.   The second quarter operating loss was $400 million, down from a$400 million profit in the first quarter, a swing attributed torising interest rates earlier this year.   Rising interest rates help push Sandamp;Ls into the red because theyhave to pay more to attract deposits even though earnings onmortgages already in their portfolio remain flat.   ``The operating loss figures show the extent to which thisindustry is still very vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations,''said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.   The Resolution Trust Corp. is trying to bring down the cost ofdeposits by injecting $15 billion to $16 billion in government fundsinto ailing thrifts before Sept. 30, Cooke said. The agencyestimates that will cut losses by about $500 million a year.   In the second quarter, as in the past, losses were concentratedin Texas, but for the first time California and Arizona rivaled theoil-producing states, which have been plagued for several years bybank and Sandamp;L failures.   Texas losses totaled $1.3 billion, a little more than a third ofthe $3.5 billion in red ink recorded in the state during the sameperiod a year ago.   California thrifts lost $950 million, the second-worst total inthe nation, and a sharp turnaround from profits of $127 million ayear ago. Sandamp;Ls from Arizona, which is suffering a real estatedownturn, lost $515 million, a marked deterioration from the $58million loss a year ago.   Barth said the California loss was heavily influenced by twolarge institutions which were taken over by regulators and forced torecognize losses from sour loans.   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Los Angeles posted a $788million loss, while Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills lost $332million, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
