Among them were new alarmistforecasts, including one from Japan, of a sharp decline inSoviet oil exports.   Thomas P. Blakeslee, a Pegasus Econometric Group energyanalyst, said anything bullish at this point is likely tomove the oil market higher. &quot;Although oil inventories appearto be adequate, there are too many uncertainties to be shortthis market,&quot; he said.   There were some fundamental factors contributing toyesterday's pricing volatility. Among them wereweather-related shutdowns of important oil-loading facilitiesin the North Sea. Also, gasoline drew support on news of afire at the Philadelphia refinery of Chevron Corp.   In U.S. futures trading, gasoline for November deliveryrose 0.96 cent a gallon to settle at 62.75 cents. Novemberheating oil was up 1.01 cents a gallon to 65.61 cents.   Also on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Novembercontract for crude oil increased 34 cents a barrel to $22.67.Meanwhile, some leading refiners boosted their field pricesfor West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude, 30 cents to50 cents a barrel.

In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices fell to theirlowest levels in two months as traders interpreted governmentstatements on the Soviet Union as bad for prospects that theU.S.S.R. will buy additional U.S. grain. A U.S. AgricultureDepartment official said yesterday that any additional U.S.export credits offered to the U.S.S.R. for food purchaseswill have to be accompanied by credits from European nations.At about the same time, the European Community released areport concluding that there is no famine in the Soviet Unionand that massive food aid might actually disrupt Sovietagriculture. Soybean traders on the floor of the ChicagoBoard of Trade sold off long positions on this news, and thesoybean contract for November delivery fell 10.75 cents to$5.77 a bushel.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices rallied. Cocoa for December deliverysoared $76 a ton to $1,298. Prices were boosted byspeculation that the Agriculture Department later this monthwill project production will fall short of demand, analystssaid. Sandra Kaul, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, addedthat concerns about economic and political instability incocoa-growing countries in West Africa, just as the harvestseason is beginning, also fueled the price rise. HarriSchwartz, analyst at Cargill Investor Services, said tradershave pretty much accepted that there will be a productiondeficit this year. He believes production has peaked and thiswill be the first of several years of deficits as trees ageand produce less. In the short-term, prices may be vulnerableto a correction at around $1,350, he says, but the long-termoutlook over the next four or five years is for prices torise.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices fell. Sugar for March delivery ended0.3 cent a pound lower at 8.55 cents. Harri Schwartz, ananalyst at Cargill Investor Services, said that prices hadbeen supported recently by apprehension that supplies forshort-term delivery remain tight. With the October contractnow expired, he said, the attention of traders has turned tothe fact that there will be a surplus when the season endsnext August. He said prices will have to fall to around 7.5cents to attract demand.</TEXT></DOC>
