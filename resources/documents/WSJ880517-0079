Separately, the Beverly Hills, Calif., leasing concern ordered 30 aircraft and options for 16 additional aircraft from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in Toulouse, France, for as much as $2 billion, making the total of International Lease orders $6.6 billion.    The Boeing and Airbus orders, which had been the subject of considerable speculation, underscored the increasing importance of leasing companies in the international air transport business.    Boeing, describing the order as an &quot;expression of confidence,&quot; took the unusual step of calling a news conference at its Seattle headquarters to announce it. The company has been under pressure to improve the quality of its aircraft since letters voicing criticism of its quality control from Japan Air Lines and British Airways were made public last month.    Boeing shares closed yesterday at $50.125, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The leasing concern's one-day purchase of a total of 170 jetliners, which had been the subject of a fierce three-way competition among the world's major aircraft makers, also means big business for aircraft engine manufacturers. The 130 jetliners under firm order will be powered by $700 million in engines made jointly by General Electric Co. and Societe Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs de Aviation (Snecma) of France, and $230 million in engines made by the Pratt andamp; Whitney division of United Technologies Corp.    As reported earlier, Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, earlier said he was negotiating for as many as 120 aircraft to meet the company's leasing needs through 1995. With world-wide airline traffic growing and aircraft orders booming, he said he was concerned that aircraft wouldn't be available in the next few years unless he placed orders far in advance of need.    The majority of orders were approved by the board of International Lease last Wednesday. But Boeing and Airbus made additional aircraft reservations available over the weekend, Mr. Hazy said yesterday.    &quot;They hold positions (on production lines) for key marketing campaigns with major airlines,&quot; Mr. Hazy said. With the eye-opening size of its order, International Lease persuaded the aircraft makers that a leasing concern was a sufficiently important player in the commercial aviation business to earn some of those coveted &quot;positions,&quot; he added.    &quot;Many&quot; of the aircraft already have been leased to airlines, Mr. Hazy said. Although he declined to give details, he said &quot;the bulk of the aircraft will go to international carriers.&quot; The company's international customers in recent years have included Lufthansa, Varig Airlines, Britannia Airways and Air New Zealand. U.S.-based customers have included Trans World Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.    The Boeing firm orders include 78 of its medium-range, twin-engine 737, which has become the world's best-selling aircraft. Including the International Lease order, Boeing has sold a total of 2,110 of the aircraft, whose various models seat between 108 and 170 passengers. At yesterday's news conference, Richard Albrecht, executive vice president of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said the International Lease order wouldn't affect Boeing's current production rate of 14 of the 737 jets per month. For several months, Boeing has been rumored to be planning to increase its 737 production rate to 17 aircraft a month.    The Boeing firm orders also include nine 757s and nine 767s, both twin-jets, and four of the four-engine 747 jumbo jet. Placed on option were an additional 19 of the 737s, two 757s, two 767s and one 747.    The largest previous aircraft order was British Airways' purchase of 16 Boeing 747s and options for 12 additional aircraft, in 1986. The total potential value of that order was $4.1 billion.    An Airbus Industrie spokesman said the Airbus order, while only the fifth-largest order in the consortium's history, is nonetheless notable because it represents the first time a customer has ordered every major Airbus model at one time.    The Airbus firm orders include 18 A320 twin-jets, which compete with the Boeing 737 model, as well as two A340s, long-range jumbo jets that compete with the Boeing 747 and 767. Firm orders also include four A300s and six A310s, both twin-jets. Placed on option were 11 additional A320s, two A340s, two A300s and one A310.    A spokesman for GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said its part of the International Lease package includes participation in firm orders for at least 226 engines. About $200 million in engines will be made by GE for the 747 and 767 aircraft. An additional $500 million of engines for the 737, A320 and A340 will be made by CFM International S.A., jointly owned by GE and Paris-based Snecma.    Should International Lease exercise its options, GE could get an additional $100 million in business on its own and CFM International could get an additional $200 million, the GE spokesman said.    In a statement, the Pratt andamp; Whitney division of United Technologies, based in Hartford, Conn., said it will make 46 engines for various 747, 757, 767, A300 and A310 aircraft. The order doesn't include any options. In addition, International Lease has ordered one Rolls-Royce PLC engine so far to power one of its 757s. Engines from the British manufacturer sell for about $9 million each, Mr. Hazy said.    Boeing said one 757, which was previously ordered but unannounced, would be delivered this month. Most of the other Boeing planes would be delivered between April 1989 and December 1995, Boeing said.    Industry analysts and observers said the orders represent a blow to St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which had been hoping to sell its new, long-range MD-11 and its short to medium-range MD-90 family of aircraft, powered by the new-generation prop fan engine.    &quot;The picture for the (planes) seems a little bit foggy,&quot; said Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;International Lease tries to buy what they think will be the most popular planes a few years down the road. They apparently don't think these models are the right ones to buy.&quot;    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said International Lease &quot;goes for the volume. They wanted to get the most airplanes at the cheapest price.&quot;    ---                     Largest Airplane Orders                     ORDER                       AMOUNT    CORP.
