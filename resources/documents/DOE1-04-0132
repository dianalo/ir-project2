In order to investigate the effectof phase composition, they prepared two model samples which were closein elemental composition but different in phase composition. One of thesewas a mechanical mixture of SiO{sub 2}, Al{sub 2}O{sub 3}, and Na{sub2}CO{sub 3}, into which they introduced oxides of Zn, Zr, Cd, and Dy.The second model sample was obtained from the first by quantitative eliminationof CO{sub 2} (as a result of Na{sub 2}CO{sub 3} decomposition) at 900{sup0}C with subsequent remelting of the mixture in a platinum ampul at 1200{sup0}C and quenching by immersing the ampul in water. As a result they obtaineda one-phase system: a glass whose homogeneity was evaluated from theequality of the refractive indices for its different sections. The effectof the form in which the impurities are found in the sample was investigatedin two model samples whose matrices were potassium chloride: the rangeof values for the relative sensitivity coefficient is maximized in thismatrix [1]. Into the matrix they introduced cadmium and copper impuritiesin the form of oxides or halides, and also zinc oxide as an internalstandard.</TEXT></DOC>
