That arrives Fridaynight, but I can't offer an opinion yet because the network won't have itsfirst press screening until today.;    The other joker has been floatingaround for several months, hoping to build up support among TV columnists, andfinally premieres tonight at 9:30. It's a half-hour &quot;dramedy&quot; about an85-year-old man, passing his time in a rest home by reflecting on his youth.It's called &quot;My Life and Times.&quot;;    Bored already? What if I tell you the85-year-old man is living in the year 2035 and the youth he's reflecting uponis in our own time? Now that's a little more intriguing.;    I'll admit tobeing hooked on the &quot;looking backward&quot; premise ever since author Thomas Bergerused it with a 121-year-old man named Jack Crabb, who remembered himself backto Custer's last stand in the novel &quot;Little Big Man.&quot;;    However, I'm sorryto say 85-year-old Ben Miller (Tom Irwin) is no Jack Crabb. His memories arenowhere near as vivid or witty. Maybe his arteries need to harden a bit more.;   In tonight's show, Ben recalls the time he was on his way to the hospitalto meet his expectant wife (Helen Hunt) and got stuck in a wrecked car withthe boss (Lawrence Monoson) he can't stand from the advertising firm where heworks.;    For the record, I should point out the year is 1989, the place SanFrancisco, and the car wreck a result of a little earthquake we had backthen.;    As you may have guessed, comedy doesn't flow naturally from such asituation. It's not exactly like being stuck between floors in an elevatorwith the boss you can't stand.;    But I don't think comedy is going to be ahigh priority in &quot;My Life and Times,&quot; which comes from Ron Koslow, the creatorof CBS's late, lamented &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot; Poignancy is the operativeword here.;    The point of &quot;My Life and Times&quot; seems to be puttingperspective on events too close to us now to really have any. Each episodewill have a different object lesson, but I think most will suggest we canlearn a lot from the past.;    In tonight's show, for instance, Ben'srecollections are prompted by a visit from his grandson, who's in a deepdepression because he didn't get into Princeton. He believes his life isruined.;    Ben begs to differ. Sometimes life throws you a curve that turnsout to be a lucky one, he explains, even if you don't recognize it at thetime.;    &quot;Life is an adventure,&quot; says Ben. &quot;You've got to hold on and let itcarry you away.&quot;;    That's pretty much what happened to him back in 1989. Hewas upset because he was stuck in a ruined car, while his first child wasbeing born -- under what might be horrifying conditions.;    But the timetogether in the wreckage forced Ben and Joe, his boss, to really get to knoweach other. Though Ben thought Joe was a menace -- &quot;His being in advertisingkept him from doing any serious harm to society,&quot; Ben observes -- Joe winds upgiving him some valuable career advice: &quot;Do everybody a favor. Get out ofadvertising.&quot;;    However, don't sit on the edge of your seat, waiting forlaughs out of this one. There aren't many. Instead, the story takes a soberingturn that may leave you more troubled than entertained.;    Tonight's show wasdirected by feature-film director Michael Apted (&quot;Coal Miner's Daughter&quot;), andit has a high-quality look. I'm especially intrigued by those distant shots ofthe 21st-century futurescape outside Ben's rest home.;    Irwin does a goodjob in his dual role as both Old Ben and Ben at whatever age he happens to bein his weekly reveries. I'm also a big fan of Helen Hunt, whose role should bea little larger in subsequent episodes.;    ABC wants us to like this one, butit's going to be an uphill struggle. Like &quot;Hooperman&quot; and &quot;The 'Slap' MaxwellStory,&quot; the network's earlier unsuccessful attempts at &quot;dramedy,&quot; this showasks viewers to shift gears a lot and do some occasional thinking.;    It alsosuffers from a certain static quality, possibly caused by the narration. Intone, it's sort of like &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; meets &quot;Quantum Leap,&quot; but isneither as funny as the former nor as fast-paced as the latter.;    I'mguessing &quot;My Life and Times&quot; will bewilder most viewers who come into it after&quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; expecting something a little livelier, maybe like&quot;Anything But Love,&quot; the brisk comedy it replaces.;    But I also expect it toquickly develop a small, but loyal following, just as Koslow's romantic&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; did. That audience will squawk plenty when ABC finallyhas to cancel it for low ratings.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910424  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  911  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 24, 199100115044,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
