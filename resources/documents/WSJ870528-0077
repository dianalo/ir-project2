Yesterday, Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines -- both units of Texas Air Corp. -- announced they will combine and overhaul their frequent-flier programs. While adding some new restrictions, the airlines also will significantly reduce the number of miles necessary to qualify for free travel. As few as 30,000 miles will entitle a member to a free trip to Hawaii, for instance, compared with 50,000 under the existing programs.    While the new program, which is effective June 15, is more appealing, it is also more complex, introducing previously untried elements to frequent-flier plans. For instance, members will be able to purchase additional mileage credits in some cases. Continental and Eastern also are going to start restricting the most liberal free-travel benefits to certain days of the week -- furthering the airlines' efforts to control loads and fill seats that would otherwise fly empty.    Competitors and others point out that Continental, for its part, enjoys uniquely low labor costs. In addition, both of the Texas Air units have experienced severe service and image problems with business travelers -- the primary targets of frequent-flier programs.    Nevertheless, industry officials and analysts say that by liberalizing and redefining their frequent-flier programs -- at a time when most airlines have been moving to tighten free-travel requirements -- Continental and Eastern have created a new battleground in the escalating airline-industry war for consumer loyalty.    &quot;You'll see more of the frequent-flier battles being waged,&quot; says Lee Howard, executive vice president of Airline Economics Inc., a Washington, D.C., research firm. Adds Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Bros. Inc., &quot;We may be seeing the opening gun of a major industry confrontation.&quot;    Other airlines said they were studying the move yesterday, but declared their unwillingness to let Continental and Eastern gain a major new competitive advantage. &quot;We intend to keep our program competitive,&quot; said a spokesman for United, a unit of Allegis Corp. &quot;It's a key element in the marketing mix.&quot; A spokesman for American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., added that it wishes to remain competitive but doesn't expect to overhaul its program.    At the very least, Texas Air's new program is bound to further the growth in what has already become one of the industry's most successful marketing tools. Frequent-flier programs rank No. 4 among the factors considered by consumers when deciding which airline to fly; studies show they rank behind convenience, cost and the travelers' past experience, but ahead of safety, service and on-time performance.    United claims four million members in its frequent-flier program, American 5.3 million and Continental and Eastern a total of &quot;several million.&quot;    Increased competition among frequent-flier programs also will raise concerns at companies that worry employees choose airlines based on frequent-flier programs rather than on the cheapest fares.    The new Texas Air program in some cases makes qualifying for unrestricted, free travel easier. For instance, two round-trip first-class tickets to Hawaii may be awarded to a program member with 100,000 miles, down from 140,000 miles. (The most popular frequent-flier benefit -- a first-class upgrade -- will continue to require 10,000 miles of travel.)    The more radical changes involve what the airlines call a &quot;MileageSaver,&quot; in which program members may qualify for free travel with far fewer miles if they agree to certain restrictions. Free U.S. round-trip &quot;companion&quot; tickets, for instance, will be available at 15,000 miles -- compared with 25,000 under the regular program -- if the recipients abide by current low-fare restrictions, which include traveling between Mondays and Thursdays with a Saturday stay.    Under the &quot;mileage-purchase&quot; plan, in certain instances a member can increase mileage credits at a cost of $10 per 1,000 mileage credits.    The Texas Air units also announced a new &quot;reward guarantee,&quot; which assures customers will have the opportunity to cash in their existing benefits for as long as three years after mileage requirements are increased. American recently added a similar guarantee. </TEXT></DOC>
