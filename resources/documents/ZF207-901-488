(automatic test equipment)</TITLE><AUTHOR>McLeod, Jonah.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Vendors of automatic test equipment (ATE) are developing a numberof strategies for making test systems more affordable.andP;  Currently,testing is a considerable factor in the cost of an electroniccomponent.andP;  Cost-cutting measures include offering ATE equipmentthat can test devices in parallel and implementing fullcharacterization tests at wafer probe instead of packaged parts.andO;Replacing expensive emitter-coupled-logic (ECL) technology withCMOS technology offers equivalent speed and accuracy forconsiderably less.andP;  Board testers are becoming more functional sothey can accommodate the built-in test ability inherent in someintegrated circuits.andP;  Increased processing power and handlingequipment that automates the mounting and unmounting of testboards means tests are performed with greater speed.andP;  Other ATEvendors are creating test systems, priced under $10,000, thateffectively test certain types of boards.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TestingAutomatic Test EquipmentMarketing StrategyComplementary Metal Oxide SemiconductorsPrice Cutting.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographgraph.andO;Caption:   The automatic test equipment market in 1989 and 1993.
