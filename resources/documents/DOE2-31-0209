Rain fell from astratiform deck associated with the passage of a mesoscale low that trackedacross southern Illinois. The ion concentrations for a set of six majoranions and cations in the sample sequences from the three sequentialchemistry stations in the SECORE-88 network. Since this rain event wasassociated with a relatively uniform stratiform cloud layer, resultingin a steady rainfall rate, the correlative behavior of these ion concentrationswill be examined both in space and time to address the question of spatialand temporal variability over space scales of several kilometers andtime scales of minutes. Clearly there is a strong correspondence betweenthe concentrations of Ca{sup 2+} and Mg{sup 2+}, reflecting their commonsource in rainfall (scavenged soil and road dust aerosols). For the Nand S species, which have both gaseous and particulate sources, however,the correspondence is not so strong. Careful analyses of these data willbe a first step in the interpretation of the data from two other stratiformcases, one on July 18 and one on July 20, and the three convective raincases sampled during the month of July.</TEXT></DOC>
