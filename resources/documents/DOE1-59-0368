It turns out thatto lowest significant order of a reductive perturbation analysis nonlinearitieshave no influence, while in toroidal confinement configurations resistivityinduces a local plasma diffusion across the magnetic surfaces. This isdemonstrated for tokamaks with zero poloidal current density. In addition,the appearance of singularities in the plasma motion parallel to themagnetic field lines suggests a profile condition at the edge of theplasma. Heat conduction would directly tend to keep these effects atlower level, while indirectly it creates a reinforcement mechanism throughthe coupling to usual cross diffusion.</TEXT></DOC>
