The stamp tax alone, headded, &quot;is largely responsible for the noteworthy absence ofa liquid and developed money market in Switzerland, and fordriving the Eurobond market abroad.&quot;   Mr. Studer also said various branches of the Swissgovernment appear to be pursuing conflicting policies,further muddying the image of the country's financial center.   &quot;Whereas the Swiss National Bank is following a tightmonetary policy to fight inflation, the government tells thebanks to restrict themselves in increasing lending rates,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
