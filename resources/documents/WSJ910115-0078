The vaccine, developed by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden,Conn., is one of several AIDS vaccines in various stages ofearly testing in people. None of these vaccines have advancedto the point where they are being tested for effectiveness inblocking infection in people exposed to the virus.</LP><TEXT>   The study of the MicroGeneSys vaccine, called VaxSyn, isthe largest and most complete test yet in humans. Researcherssaid the test was especially important because it was thefirst to report that volunteers can be enlisted for an AIDSvaccine test and that the vaccine wasn't dangerous.   In a report published in the latest issue of the Annals ofInternal Medicine, researchers reported the final results ofa study begun in 1988. The study, conducted for almost twoyears, found that the vaccine didn't cause any healthproblems among the volunteers. After several doses, thevaccine stimulated the release of antibodies against thevirus in 30 of the 33 people, an indication that the vaccinetriggered an immune response.   However, the antibodies' effectiveness appeared limited.Antibodies taken from only five of 24 of the people were ableto block the virus from infecting unaffected cells in testtube studies. Still, Frank Volvovitz, chairman ofMicroGeneSys, said the limited effectiveness was &quot;veryencouraging&quot; as an initial finding.   Mr. Volvovitz said the company was pressing officials atthe National Institutes of Health to help organize a study ofthe vaccine's ability to block infection in people at highrisk of exposure to the virus.   Dani Bolognesi, an AIDS researcher at Duke UniversityMedical Center, said the newly reported VaxSyn trial was animportant first step. &quot;But we've got a ways to go before wecan say this vaccine or any other is ready for a large-scaletest as a vaccine&quot; for preventing infection,&quot; Dr. Bolognesisaid.   Raphael Dolin, a researcher at University of Rochester andthe lead author of the current report, said the MicroGeneSysvaccine may be one of several vaccines that prove useful evenif they only provide partial protection against the virus.The new study will &quot;lay the groundwork&quot; for more research inpeople and animals, using higher doses of VaxSyn, orcombining it with other vaccines, he said.   VaxSyn is a genetically engineered version of a protein,called gp160, on the surface of the AIDS virus. In November,Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif., said it beganhuman tests of a vaccine based on the viral protein gp120.Its study, in people already infected by the virus, willdetermine if its vaccine can block the virus from infectingunaffected cells.   In September, American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-AyerstLaboratories signed an agreement to help fund theMicroGeneSys vaccine research.</TEXT></DOC>
