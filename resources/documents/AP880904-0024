The week-long celebration of ``Saddam's Qadissiyeh'' _ an Iraqiterm for the war _ marks the anniversary of Iranian shelling ofIraqi territory that Iraq claims began the fighting on Sept. 4.   Iran dates the war's beginning 18 days later, when Iraqi troopsinvaded Iran. The United Nations cease-fire resolution accepted byboth sides calls for an independent body to determine who began thewar.   The armed forces newspaper Al-Qadissiyeh said in an editorialthat the anniversary ``has become an immortal event in our historyso that coming generations will not forget the Persians'(Iranians') aggression and evil intentions against Arabs andIslam.''   Banners strung in the streets by the ruling Baath Party andpoems read over state television heaped praise on President SaddamHussein.   ``Through the great leader and the great people, victory andpeace have been achieved,'' read one banner.   ``Oh Saddam, thou art the voice of history,'' a poet pronouncedon television. ``Thou art the only hero at a time when there is noone else to confront (the foe).   ``Thou hast brought back to Baghdad and Babylon their glory.''   Official newspapers hammered at the themes of Iraq's stand atthe U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Iran in Geneva, and accusedIran of violating the cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.   They also blasted Iran's insistence on returning to a southernborder line established by the 1975 Algiers agreement _ the middleof the Shatt Al-Arab waterway. Iraq has renounced the pact, sayingit wants all of the waterway.   Saad al-Bazaz, director-general of the official Iraqi NewsAgency, wrote in the Baath Party daily Al-Thawra that before thewar, ``Iran violated two important elements of the 1975 Algiersagreement and chose only one to its benefit.''   He said Iran refused to return land along the central border asthe treaty demanded and failed to respect ``the principle ofnon-interference in internal affairs.''   Iranian support for Iraqi Kurdish rebels before the war hadaggravated tensions between the neighboring states.   Iraq dates the war to Sept. 4, 1980, when Iran shelled Iraqitowns on the central border after months of escalating propagandaclaims by both sides.   Iraq also accuses Iran of attacking ships in the Shatt Al-Arabbefore Sept. 22, when Iraq invaded Iran.   The term ``Saddam's Qadissiyeh'' recalls a 7th century victoryby Arab Islamic troops over the Persians in Iraq that opened theway for Islam's expansion to the east.</TEXT></DOC>
