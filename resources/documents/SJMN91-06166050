Just as it would beunthinkable -- nay, a mortal sin -- to divulge whodunit, the labored clues andwheezy construction are beyond criticism. &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; has stood the testof time.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OF MICE AND MYSTERYWHY BUILD A BETTER 'MOUSETRAP'?HALLOWED WHODUNIT STILL PULLS IN CROWDS AFTER40 YEARS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     The advance ticket sales prove it: The Rep has already scheduled extraperformances.;    The production, directed by Edward Stern of RutgersUniversity, at least compliments the play by taking it seriously. The castdoesn't camp it up; and as with any production designed by Jeffrey Struckman,it looks spectacular. Here he goes to town on an English country inn,half-buried in a most persuasive snowfall, under a cheerless winter skycreated by lighting designer Derek Duarte.;    Remember the game of &quot;Clue&quot;?You'll instantly recognize Miss Scarlet (in the conservatory with the garrote)and Col. Mustard (in the library with the candlestick). There are no realpeople to speak of, though Christie tiptoes around in what was then unexploredterritory: psychotherapy.;    Out of such slight material, the actors manageto stir up some fun. Will Marchetti, for instance, disguises himself with alot of hair goo and an ersatz Slavic accent, which should put any thinkingmember of the audience on guard, for his shady character is calledParavicini.;    The cast also includes the estimable Wanda McCaddon, finallymaking her local debut as the upright and unpleasant Mrs. Boyle; Ken Grantham,a longtime member of the Berkeley Rep company, as stiff-upper-lipped MajorMetcalf; and Will Leskin, back from pounding the pavements of Hollywood andBurbank, as the investigating officer. It's a delight to have back ChristianneHauber, almost a charter member of the Rep, as the mannish Miss Casewell.;   Tony Soper, who played the more normal of the two computer whiz kids in &quot;PickUp Ax,&quot; is the innkeeper and Sarah Dacey his wife. Like their roles, they'reboth pleasant, somewhat bland. As Christopher Wren, by profession -- youguessed it -- an architect, John McCluggage is not nearly eccentric enough.;   Except for McCaddon, who is English by birth, and Grantham, who long agoperfected his stage British, the accents are every which way. The cast soundsas though it came from the far corners of the Commonwealth, including those 13upstart colonies.;    Reality is not what this play is about, but WarrenTravis has gone for dull accuracy in his costumes, in the dull, serviceablecolors of English fabric under postwar rationing. The incidental music is pureB-movie stuff, except for one good joke: Mrs. Boyle, about to meet her doom,turns on the BBC and gets the apocalyptic &quot;Dies Irae&quot; from Verdi's &quot;Requiem.&quot;;   P.S. I've salted the name of the murderer into this piece. If you figure itout -- shh.
