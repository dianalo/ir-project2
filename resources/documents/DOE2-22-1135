<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-1135 </DOCNO><TEXT>On using the Poisson distribution truncated at zero for intermediate clusterdecay in a compound Poisson process we obtain TCP distribution whichdescribes quite well the multiplicity distributions in hadronic collisions.A comparison is made between TCP and NB for UA5 data. The reduced momentsupto the fifth agree very well with the observed ones. The TCP curvesare narrower at very high energy and develop shoulders and oscillationswhich become increasingly pronounced as the energy grows. At lower energiesthe curves are very close to the NB ones. A discussion of compound Poissondistribution, expressions of reduced moments and Poisson transforms arealso given. The TCP curves for different values of the parameters andcurves of the reduced moments are also presented. (author). 11 refs,3 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
