Until last year, the U.S. government's radio network couldn'tget permission to station a correspondent in Moscow.   Now, the VOA is playing supersonic tag with Mikhail Gorbachev.   When Gorbachev flew to Malta for his summit with President Bush,the ``chase plane'' of journalists from Moscow accredited by theKremlin to cover the event also carried VOA Moscow correspondentAndre de Nesnara.   De Nesnara, a Russian-speaking American, has been stationed inMoscow for a year covering the fast-paced changes in the SovietUnion for the radio network that broadcasts more than 2,000 hoursweekly in 49 languages.   The crumbling order in Eastern Europe, one of the prime regionstargeted for more than 40 years by VOA broadcasts, has afforded thenetwork undreamed of opportunities to report on a part of the worldnever before accessible to its correspondents. But is has alsoforced changes in network thinking.   ``We came to the conclusion about two years ago that we had tobe more compelling, more interesting'' to compete with theincreasingly free and lively programs by radio stations in EasternEurope, said Sidney A. Davis, VOA's programming director.   VOA has aired roundtable satellite discussions between Sovietand American experts, as well as call-in programs from the SovietUnion with listeners asking questions about economic, medical andscientific issues.   ``We can offer them expertise their radio stations can't,''Davis said.   But the fact remains that VOA gets its money, $180 millionannually, from the U.S. government. Its editorials still reflectofficial policy.   While the editorials on the summit didn't tell VOA listenersanything that Bush himself didn't tell Gorbachev at Malta, thelanguage was blunter.   The United States contends Nicaragua and Cuba are shippingSoviet-made arms to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador to fight theU.S.-backed government. Gorbachev said his government isn'tinvolved and had been assured by the Nicaraguan government that ithas not shipped any weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.   Bush told reporters at the joint news conference with Gorbachevthat he and the Soviet leader ``have a difference.'' GivingGorbachev the benefit of the doubt, Bush said: ``I don't believethe Sandinistas have told the truth to our Soviet friends.''   But a Dec. 1 VOA opinion piece was more direct.   ``High levels of Soviet aid to Cuba and Nicaragua help thesecountries to support subversion and destabilization in CentralAmerica,'' it said. ``The Soviet Union should press Cuba andNicaragua to curb such activities.   ``The Soviet Union also continues to pour massive amounts ofheavy weapons into Afghanistan. These weapons are taking a terribletoll on civilians and help to keep in power a repressive communistregime.''   Transcripts of the broadcast reports, as well as of theeditorials, were made available under a recently publicized policyof openness by VOA.   The station's 1942 charter forbids it to disseminate itsbroadcasts within the United States to prevent the VOA from beingused by the administration to indoctrinate Americans.   The law does allow American reporters and academics to reviewVOA material, but network officials say this access was not widelyknown until a recent case involving a lawsuit by NBC News PresidentMichael Gartner.   Gartner contends VOA only began allowing access to its broadcastmaterial after he filed suit against the network's parent agency,the U.S. Information Agency, which argued that barringdissemination of USIA material within the United States violatesthe First Amendment.   A U.S. District Court in Iowa last month dismissed Gartner'ssuit.</TEXT></DOC>
