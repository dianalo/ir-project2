This year's group -- two of whom named six stocks and two of whom picked five -- includes last year's most successful participant, Frank Husic. A year ago, Mr. Husic was a senior vice president with Alliance Capital Management Corp. Now he heads his own money management concern, Husic Capital Management, San Francisco.    Mr. Husic's return last year was fueled by two big winners. The share price of First Capital Holdings, a Los Angeles-based seller of mutual funds and life insurance, leaped from $6 to $14.875 during the year. SHL Systemhouse, which helps businesses integrate different computer systems, also more than doubled in price during the year, after adjusting for a mid-December stock split.    Even though First Capital Holdings has risen substantially, and recently sold for about 27 times earnings, Mr. Husic says it has potential for a further rise, based on the public demand for mutual funds and tax-sheltered life insurance products.    He also is recommending Texas Air in the belief that Frank Lorenzo, its chairman, chief executive officer and president, can make major cost cuts at Eastern Airlines and integrate People Express with the airline company's Eastern and Continental units.    Heritage Communications, a cable-television system operator, gains his vote for its expected high cash flow and the effects of deregulation of the cable industry. Rounding out his list are LSI Logic, a maker of custom semiconductor products; Itel, a container-leasing, electrical parts distribution and dredging concern built by new management on the skeleton of the former computer equipment leasing company; and MiniScribe, a leading maker of 3 1/2-inch disk drives.    International Business Machines stock has been out of favor with many investors of late, but not with David Dreman, a managing partner of Dreman andamp; Embry, a New York investment counseling concern with about $2 billion under management. Mr. Dreman, author of the book &quot;The New Contrarian Investment Strategy,&quot; said, &quot;I would have to give up my contrarian badge if I didn't like IBM.&quot;    He points out that the computer giant was recently selling at a price/earnings ratio of 13, a shade below the average multiple on the Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. 500-stock index.    Both Ford and Chrysler are on Mr. Dreman's buy list because, he says, they're &quot;awfully cheap&quot; at about four to five times estimated 1987 earnings. Anticipating a comeback in the highly cyclical property and casualty insurance industry, Mr. Dreman likes St. Paul Cos. and Safeco. He also likes defense contractors -- and puts General Dynamics on his list -- on grounds of good long-term growth rates and &quot;virtual monopolies&quot; in some market niches.    Noting that many companies have taken big write-offs recently, Mr. Dreman suggests that operating earnings are healthier than many people think. He expects 10% earnings growth for major companies in 1987.    Peter Anderson, president of IDS Advisory Group, by contrast, isn't expecting much growth in corporate profits this year. In his view, &quot;anemic&quot; economic growth, low inflation and easy money will push interest rates down this year -- perhaps to 4% on Treasury bills and 6.5% or less on 30-year Treasury bonds by the end of 1987. In that environment, he expects P/E ratios on stocks to rise and thinks the stock market could gain 20% or more for the third straight year.    In general, Mr. Anderson favors interest-sensitive and defensive issues -- bank stocks, utilities and companies in the drug, tobacco and food industries. His favorite five are an eclectic collection of blue chips: General Electric, Philip Morris, McDonald's, Piedmont and First Union. The General Electric management team led by Jack Welch, he says, &quot;may be, for a large company, the best management in the country.&quot;    First Union, he notes, has digested several regional banks in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, and it has become one of the largest banks in the Southeast. It has made relatively few loans to less developed countries and few energy loans. Mr. Anderson calls Piedmont &quot;one of the better airlines,&quot; with a good balance sheet and cash flow, and he figures Delta or American might try to acquire it.    Elliott Schlang, a senior vice president of Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., says he doesn't &quot;play economist&quot; but expects a &quot;slight firming&quot; in the economy this year. His picks, small to medium-sized companies based in the Midwest, don't include any household names. Mr. Schlang likes companies that show steady earnings growth, even under adverse conditions. He generally looks for a strong balance sheet, low institutional ownership and high share ownership by the people who run the company.    J.P. Industries, Ann Arbor, Mich., has been built through 10 leveraged buyouts of underperforming industrial companies, mostly in the plumbing-products and engine-parts businesses. The company's earnings have grown each year since it was founded in 1979.    Also on Mr. Schlang's list are Schulman Inc., an Akron, Ohio-based maker of plastic compounds and resins; Thor Industries, which he calls &quot;the Rolls Royce of the recreational vehicle industry&quot;; Cintas Corp., a national uniform-rental concern based in Cincinnati; and Lawson Products, a distributor of maintenance products based in Des Plaines, Ill.    According to Mr. Schlang, Thor Industries has a 28% return on equity and no debt. Several of his other choices similarly have high returns and little debt. J.P. Industries, however, because it acquires companies through debt-financed buyouts, is more highly leveraged, with debt equal to 37% of total capital.    ---   ELLIOTT SCHLANG is a senior vice president with Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben in Cleveland, and partner in charge of Great Lakes Review.    1987 Picks:   J.P.
