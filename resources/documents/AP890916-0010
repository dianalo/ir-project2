The president, at a news conference, called the shootings thework of a deranged individual and said, ``It is terrible, and theloss of human life is horrible.''   But Bush, a life member of the National Rifle Association, saidinstead of enacting new laws, ``we must do everything we can toenforce laws that are already on the books.''   Bush was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in CampDavid, Md., before heading west on a two-day trip next week. He willparticipate in bicentennial ceremonies in South Dakota, Montana andWashington on Monday.   At the news conference for out-of-town reporters, Bush also:   _Repeated his opposition to raising federal taxes to pay for thewar against drugs, but said he would not criticize state or localgovernments that did so.   _Said the nation's education system ``is not making the grade''and hoped his Sept. 27-28 education summit with the nation'sgovernors would lead to national educational goals and objectivesfor schools.   _Rejected a suggestion that the United States divert funds fromits contribution to NATO to pay for the drug war. ``Let's not letdown our alliance guarantees because we are more optimistic aboutpeace,'' he said.   _Indicated he was giving ``serious and active'' consideration tousing former military bases to house prisoners from overcrowdedprisons.   Bush was asked what he would tell the families of victims ofThursday's shooting spree in a Louisville printing plant in which aworker with several automatic weapons went from floor to floorshooting down former co-workers.   ``I'd tell them I feel horrible about the loss of life.''   But, he added, ``I would tell them I don't think banning weaponsis going to be the ultimate answer or could ever safeguard againstthat kind of tragedy.''   He recalled automatic weapons were not involved in the 1966shooting spree by Charles Whitman, who climbed to the top of a towerat the University of Texas at Austin with three rifles, two pistolsand a shotgun. He shot 44 people, killing 14, before being killedhimself.   He also said that in the 1960s, when he was a member of the Houseof Representatives, he went to a police station in the District ofColumbia to register ``my arsenal'' of a rifle and a shotgun tocomply with the law.   ``The guy looked at me like I'd lost his mind,'' Bush said,adding that only a small percentage of gun owners were complyingwith the law. Bush said he asked the officer if police were``getting a lot of criminals to turn their guns in?   ``He said, `No. It's just a bunch of suckers like you fromNorthwest Washington.' And it made a profound impression on me.''   Bush banned the import of foreign-made assault rifles into theUnited States, including the AK-47, the weapon used in Louisville.   However, possession of these weapons is not a federal offense,nor does the import ban prevent them from being manufactureddomestically.</TEXT></DOC>
