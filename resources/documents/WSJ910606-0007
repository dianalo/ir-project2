These laws segregate places of residence and employment byrace, alloting the worst areas for the black-majoritypopulation. Under the Land Act, 87% of land in South Africais reserved for the white minority.</LP><TEXT>   Under U.S. law, repeal of the Group Areas Act is one ofseveral conditions that must be met before U.S. sanctionsagainst South Africa are terminated.   Meeting in the legislative capital of Cape Town, theparliament passed the measure by voice vote. State PresidentF.W. de Klerk first announced his intention to have the lawsrepealed when he opened parliament in February. Members ofthe all-white Conservative Party opposed the bill. SchalkPienaar, a Conservative Party member, said the bill isunpatriotic and disloyal to the &quot;white nation.&quot; He vowed, &quot;Wewill retain this land to the end,&quot; suggesting arms would beused if whites find that necessary.   The legislation creates an advisory commission on landallocation that will make recommendations to the president onhow state-owned land may be allocated to blacks who wereforcibly removed from their property by the now-repealedlaws.   Labor Party members, all part of the so-called coloredpopulation group, remained silent during the vote to displaytheir opposition to a provision in the legislation. Thatprovision would allow neighborhood committees to set &quot;normsand standards&quot; in their residential communities.   The law says the norms and standards may cover suchfactors as population density, maintenance and cleanliness.&quot;Any by-law that discriminates on the ground of race, coloror religion or is grossly unfair shall be of no force andeffect,&quot; the legislation adds.   But Labor Party leaders argued that the standards could beused to keep neighborhoods all-white. This point likely willbe raised by anti-apartheid activists and members of Congresswhen issues concerning the U.S. Comprehensive Anti-ApartheidAct of 1986 are debated.   In a &quot;Report Card on U.S. Sanctions Against South Africa&quot;issued in March, TransAfrica, a Washington-based lobbyorganization, said the U.S. provision calling for repeal ofgroup areas would remain unfulfilled if local authoritiessubstituted like measures for the defunct national one.   In Washington, a U.S. official said the parliament'saction showed &quot;positive movement indicating that Mr. de Klerkdoes what he says he will do.&quot; The official added that thefinal pillar of apartheid remaining is the PopulationRegistration Act, and that too is scheduled for repeal laterthis month.   The administration plans to take a closer look at thepolitical-prisoner issue over the next few weeks. Any effortto lift sanctions, though, is likely to touch off a fightwith some members of Congress and anti-apartheid groups whodisagree with the administration's assertion that nearly allbona fide political prisoners have been released.   Thirty-one prisoners have been conducting hunger strikes,ranging from 12 to 36 days, to protest the government'sfailure to meet an April 30 deadline for the release ofpolitical prisoners, the independent Human Rights Commissionsaid in Johannesburg.   Separately, on Monday the government released a draftdocument on the restructuring of South Africa's rigidlysegregated educational system, which keeps blacks inovercrowded, poorly equipped and maintained classrooms. Thereport recommends equal educational opportunities, but alsoallows for continued white-only schools.</TEXT></DOC>
