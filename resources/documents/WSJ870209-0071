Hutton Group Inc. reported a $133.8 million net loss for the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a previously announced $130 million provision for potential losses on certain securities products.    Even without the provisions, Hutton said, it would have had a profit of only $617,000 in the quarter. Robert P. Rittereiser, president and chief executive officer, said that although the results were &quot;disappointing . . . we are now in a strong position for growth and profitability.&quot;    In the 1985 fourth quarter, Hutton had a loss of $12.2 million, which included a $40.3 million provision to cover potential losses in connection with certain mortgages and a note receivable outstanding.    The $130 million provision in the latest quarter covers potential customer losses related to certain improperly marketed floating-rate and zero-coupon municipal securities as well as potential losses associated with tax shelter products. In addition, the provision covers litigation costs, office consolidation and severance payments.    Hutton said that as a result of the provisions, the company was unable to record $81.3 million of income tax benefits and reversed a $5.2 million one-time credit previously reported in 1986.    Revenue in the quarter totaled $685.4 million, down 2% from the year-earlier $696.9 million.    Commission revenue rose 11% to $227.6 million in the quarter; asset management fees rose 63% to a record $65.8 million. Reflecting the $130 million provision taken in the quarter and, thus, cancellation of previously recorded transactions, revenue from principal transactions was a negative $9 million; a year earlier, revenue from principal transactions totaled $56.2 million. Investment banking revenue declined slightly to $112.5 million from $118.4 million.    For the year, Hutton had a net loss of $90.3 million, in contrast to year-earlier net income of $43.7 million, or $1.63 a share. Revenue rose 13% to $2.76 billion from $2.45 billion.    Commission revenue rose 28% to $929.8 million; revenue from principal transactions fell 15% to $197.3 million; and investment banking revenue fell 11% to $315 million. </TEXT></DOC>
