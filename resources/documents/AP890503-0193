Jolene Unsoeld said Wednesday.   Unsoeld, D-Wash., outlined details of what she said is anagreement that might end the dispute over use of the huge nets. Shewas critical of the pact.   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea andJapan use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and covermore than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day.   American fishermen claim that vessels from Taiwan, South Koreaand Japan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons ofsalmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have saidthe illegal fishing has already impacted salmon runs in Alaska,Washington state and Oregon.   Unsoeld, D-Wash., released what she said are details of thepact, based on talks with unnamed officials from the StateDepartment and the U.S. fishing industry.   She said the pact calls for:</TEXT><TEXT>   _ 2 observers stationed aboard Japanese driftnet vessels tomonitor their catch. There are an estimated 400 vessels in theJapanese driftnet fleet.   _ An increase from four to five in the number of Japanese patrolvessels in the North Pacific and an increase in patrol days for thevessels from the current 250 per year to 600 per year. U.S.enforcement officers will be stationed aboard the patrol vessels.   _ Stiffer Japanese penalties for ships caught illegally driftnetfishing.   _ Marking of all driftnets so the owners of those cast adriftcan be identified.   _ A ban on the high-seas transfer of fish between Japanesetrawlers and freighters, which carry the fish back to port.   Unsoeld said the Japanese refused to agree to a U.S. StateDepartment request for a pilot program to place transponders on adozen or so Japanese vessels. Using satellites, the U.S. could havemonitored the movements of the ships.   The U.S. is considering a transponder test using Americanvessels, Unsoeld said.   Other congressional sources, who asked not to be identified,confirmed most of the details supplied by Unsoeld, but added thatthe agreement was for only one year and the Japanese haveessentially told the State Department ``take it or leave it.''   The sources also said the Japanese have indicated they plan tomove the legal driftnet zone slightly northward, though exactly howfar remains unclear.   The existing driftnet zone was designed to keep fishing vesselsfar south of the migration routes of North American salmon.   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for ocean andfisheries, was out of his office and unavailable for commentWednesday. Earlier this week, Wolfe told a House subcommittee thatan agreement with the Japanese was close.   Congressional sources said the agreement has actually beensigned by Japanese officials and initialed by U.S. negotiators.   ``I am extremely apprehensive that this agreement will not beadequate,'' said Unsoeld. ``I am also not sure that this will meetthe requirements of the 1987 Driftnet Act.''   Under that act, if Japan and other countries with driftnetfleets have not entered into monitoring and enforcement agreementswith the United States by June 29, the president could impose tradesanctions.   Unsoeld said she was upset that the Japanese had refused toagree to a transponder test program.   ``We may have negotiated away our ability to put any teeth inour action,'' she said. ``It's absolutely goofy. If they aren'tviolating any existing agreements, why are they objecting to usplacing transponders on their ships?''   Unsoeld also said she felt the number of observers called for inthe agreement falls short of what was needed to provide``sufficient'' data on the impact of driftnet fishing.</TEXT></DOC>
