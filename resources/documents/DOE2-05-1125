However,possible results must be analyzed by taking into account the featuresof the demand (amount, time sharing, degree of certainty of public commitment,behaviour of the buyer-user utility), and the features of the supplysector (its competitiveness and degree of technological content, vis-a-visthe international market and the main foreign suppliers). From the analysisin this article, the reduction of the technological gap in industry resultsas a likely product of the energy program, while the size and the uncertaintyof the program, coupled with some particular behaviour of the utility,do not seem to be able by themselves to trigger off a permanent processof improvement of the relative international competitiveness of the industry.</TEXT></DOC>
