The ruling stems from a 1984 lawsuit against the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center by John Moore, a leukemia patient who had his diseased spleen removed in 1976. A doctor at the university, David Golde, and a colleague experimented with cells from the diseased organ, eventually developing a cell line producing certain biological substances in quantities that could be used in research on cancer, AIDS and other diseases affecting the body's immune system.    The university and Dr. Golde patented the cell line and entered into an agreement with Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., to research the cell line and possibly produce biotechnology products with it, an attorney for Mr. Moore said.    Mr. Moore's suit, dismissed by a lower court in 1986, claimed that Dr. Golde and the medical center had misappropriated his &quot;unique&quot; bodily material and put it to profitable commercial use without his knowledge or consent.    Allan Wagner, counsel for the University of California, said the appellate court decision, if upheld on further appeal, &quot;could have dramatic ramifications on general medical research in terms of what {bodily} materials we can use. We want materials that are free and clear of others' claims.&quot;    Medical researchers have always used human biological material, which is usually obtained as &quot;waste&quot; specimens in connection with surgery or other treatment aimed at improving a patient's health. Its use has increased substantially as a result of continuing advances in genetic engineering and the increasingly close ties between biotechnology companies and university researchers.    Mr. Wagner said the university may request a reconsideration of the case by the appellate court or appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. Attorneys for Dr. Golde and Genetics Institute weren't immediately available for comment on the ruling. </TEXT></DOC>
