Now, that is supposed to change: Europe's flag carriers are developing two giant international reservation networks, partly to fend off competition from even bigger, and slicker, U.S. systems, and partly to handle an expected explosion of air travel in Europe. The owners say the new networks, called Galileo and Amadeus, won't discriminate against airlines that aren't involved.    But smaller airlines and some analysts are skeptical of that claim. They fear a new airline oligopoly could form just when cartel arrangements are being broken down by deregulatory moves in Europe, Japan, Australia and Canada.    Certainly, the opportunities for unfair market domination are rife. &quot;The concept of having a totally unbiased system won't be easily achieved,&quot; says Derek O'Brien, commercial director of Ryanair, an independent Irish airline. &quot;Someone always has to be listed first. . . . For smaller carriers like us, it depends on how the bias will be built in.&quot;    Jan van Bekkum, Galileo's chief executive, acknowledged in a recent speech: &quot;Dominance by these reservations consortia may well happen in home markets and will need some controls to contain its effect. You can't rely on market forces alone to create fair, competitive conditions.&quot;    Amadeus and Galileo will include each other's listings, but at least initially they will tend to continue the nationalistic status quo. For example, Madrid-based Amadeus, which groups Lufthansa German Airlines, Air France, Iberia Air Lines of Spain, Scandinavian Airlines System and seven smaller carriers, in 1990 will link the existing national booking systems into a souped-up, supranational entity with new powers.    Thus, German travel agencies that are already linked to Lufthansa's system will be much more likely to become Amadeus agents than to sign up with Galileo or a U.S. system selling in Europe. Ditto in France and Spain.    &quot;Amadeus isn't a feasible solution&quot; when Aer Lingus and its network have chosen Galileo, says Ryanair's Mr. O'Brien. For Irish travel agents, &quot;the choice is illusory rather than real.&quot;    Galileo, based in Swindon, England, intends to follow a similar plan. Nine carriers -- including British Airways, Alitalia Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Aer Lingus -- next spring plan to connect their national travel agency computer networks and by late summer start operating a central data core.    Both European systems maintain that they plan to sell vigorously to travel agents in each other's natural markets. But judging from their announced plans, that doesn't seem to be the first priority. They also say their communal activities will help travel agents by giving them one easy-to-use terminal with constantly updated listings for airlines, hotels, railways, car rental agencies -- even limousines, flowers and flight insurance -- around the world. Such listings will be without prejudice to any listed participant and will follow rules of conduct being developed by at least two regulatory agencies, both Amadeus and Galileo say.    Charles Powell, director of scheduled services for Air Europe, a British independent, sees Galileo and Amadeus as big improvements over the existing bookings systems. These consortia will take the reservations function away from the individual airlines -- and by implication, their biases, he says. And agents will have more choices and will find it easier to be neutral about which airline they book, thus giving consumers a better deal.    Both systems say they will offer agents two choices: a neutral screen that lists flights by objective criteria like route and time of day and another that allows the agent to call up one carrier first. &quot;If the agent is getting a special deal from a participating airline, he can show all their flights first,&quot; explains Adrian Leben, a Galileo manager.    &quot;We can't guarantee the system is used in a perfectly neutral way,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Amadeus.    Indeed, analysts say more supervision is needed. Thus, the European Community Commission, the United Nations' civil aviation organization, the European Civil Aviation Conference and others are trying, piecemeal, to develop codes of conduct that will steer the emerging systems away from antitrust behavior.    &quot;Regulatory agencies are beginning to recognize that exclusion from important computer reservations systems is just as serious for an airline as the denial of traffic rights or exclusion from important gateways,&quot; Hugh Welburn, managing director of the London consultancy Travel Trends International, said recently. </TEXT></DOC>
