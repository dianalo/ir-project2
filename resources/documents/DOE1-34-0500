Pioneering work from several centers initiateda widespread clinical evaluation of this imaging modality in cardiacdiagnosis that was facilitated by commercially available digital angiographysystems that provided rudimentary image manipulation techniques. Suchimage manipulation was also of considerable use in intraarterial applications.The quantitative information inherent in digital images of the heartchambers and coronary arteries sparked a keen interest in using thistechnology to extract both anatomical and physiological information aboutpatients undergoing cardiac catheterization. This chapter outlines theirapproach to the use of both intravenous and intraarterial digital techniquesin the evaluation of patients requiring cardiac catheterization witha particular emphasis on determination of the functional significanceof coronary disease.</TEXT></DOC>
