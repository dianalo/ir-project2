BishopStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GE EUROPTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   General Electric Co.'s proposed acquisition of a French medical equipment maker is but the latest sally in a global battle of giants over the world's $4.5 billion-a-year diagnostic-imaging business.    The potential effect is to narrow choices for users while quickening the chase for profits.    In an agreement announced Wednesday, GE is to take over Thomson-CGR, the medical equipment arm of Thomson S.A., the big electronics company owned by the French government. The takeover is part of the price Thomson is paying GE for the latter's consumer electronics business. In addition to the medical equipment business, GE will receive an amount of cash, which wasn't disclosed but is said to be between $500 million and $1 billion.    The GE-Thomson pact is the third major shake-up to hit the diagnostic-imaging equipment business in the past 15 months. In April 1986, Johnson andamp; Johnson, the big New Brunswick, N.J.-based drug maker, dropped out of the medical-imaging business entirely, selling its inventories and service commitments to GE.    Three months ago, N.V. Philips, the big Dutch electronics company, and General Electric Co. of Britain, which is unrelated to the U.S. company, announced plans to merge their medical equipment businesses. The merged firm would be the largest supplier of diagnostic-imaging equipment in Europe.    As a result of the shakeout now under way, hospitals in the U.S. and abroad that are seeking to buy new multimillion-dollar, high-technology diagnostic machines probably will find their choice of suppliers narrowed to a few large companies. Besides the American GE and the Philips-GE of Britain ventures, the major suppliers include Siemens A.G. of West Germany, two big Japanese electronics concerns, Hitachi and Toshiba, and Diasonics Inc. in the U.S.    The companies are all suppliers of conventional X-ray equipment, ultrasound equipment such as that used in obstetrics in prenatal diagnostic procedures, the so-called CAT scanners, the new multimillion-dollar magnetic resonance imaging -- or MRI -- machines that can provide detailed pictures of internal organs, and computerized devices for digital subtraction angiography, a technique for visualizing the blood vessels.    The GE acquisition of Thomson-CGR, which has about $770 million in annual sales, will have little effect on the U.S. diagnostic-imaging market. Thomson produces most of the same type of equipment that GE already sells here. The exception is X-ray mammography equipment for the diagnosis of breast cancer. &quot;Thomson has a more complete line of mammography equipment,&quot; said Robert L. Stocking, vice president of marketing for GE's medical equipment group in Milwaukee.    The main effect of the acquisition will be to give GE a stronger position in Europe and Latin American, Mr. Stocking said. Thomson, he noted, has a dominant position in France and Brazil, areas where GE hasn't been a major factor. As Alain Gomez, chairman and chief executive officer of Thomson noted in the Wednesday announcement, &quot;this agreement will place the combined medical business of GE and Thomson-CGR in the global forefront of medical imaging, alongside Philips and Siemens . . .&quot;    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, GE closed at $56.75, up 62.5 cents. It was the fourth most-actively traded Big Board issue, with 1.8 million shares changing hands.    The industrywide shakeout stems from a squeeze on profits by high development costs for new technology and competition wrought by overcapacity, analysts said.    The profit squeeze is likely to continue. The industry depends heavily on new technology for future growth and has had some disappointments, said Carl Park, senior consultant for the health care industries group at Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. The industry's biggest business is in conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment. Technological change in this field is rare and growth is expected to be an unglamorous 2% a year, he said.    &quot;Everyone had great expectations for digital subtraction angiography but growth there has flattened out,&quot; Mr. Park said. This is a technique in which shades of gray in X-rays are converted to digital data, allowing doctors to enhance images.    Similarly, the CAT scanners, X-ray machines that can give highly detailed pictures of bones and internal structures, were hailed as a high-growth area. While CAT scanners are being widely used, their growth potential is theatened by the MRI machines, which can provide even better images of a wider variety of tissues.    A bright spot is the world ultrasound equipment market, expected to grow at 5% to 8% a year, and reach $1.3 billion annually by 1995, Mr. Park said. Ultrasound equipment is less expensive than CAT and MRI scanners and safer than X-rays.    But the industry's future hinges on pouring more money into technological advances for the MRI machines, which sell for a few million dollars each. Market growth here could run 15% to 20% annually, reaching a world market of $800 million by 1995, Mr. Park projected. Compared with CAT scanners, however, MRI machines handle a limited number of patients per day, generating relatively high costs per patient.    Thus, market growth for MRI machinery will depend on manufacturers improving image quality and increasing patient &quot;load,&quot; Mr. Park said. </TEXT></DOC>
