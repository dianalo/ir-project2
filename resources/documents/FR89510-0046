Scope: The State of Washington, through its Centennial Commission, is sponsoringa series of international trade/export symposia, including one in Richland,Washington, which will include discussions of barriers to and means offacilitating the transfer to the private sector of technology developedin government laboratories. In accordance with the requirements of theFederal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-502), DOE wishes toparticipate in and help support this conference. The proposed award willassure that the Government's role (particularly DOE's) in technology transferwill be addressed, and DOE believes that the purpose and the goals of theTechnology Symposium are relevant to the DOE mission. The cost of thisconference is expected to be approximately $191,000. DOE's support is proposedto be $50,000. The DOE has determined that the award on a noncompetitive basis is appropriatebecause the applicant is already conducting this activity using its ownresources and those donated by third parties; however, DOE support wouldenhance the public benefits to be derived, any effort to support anothergroup for the same purpose would not be in the public interest, and DOEknows of no other entity which is conducting or planning to conduct suchan activity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Marji W.
