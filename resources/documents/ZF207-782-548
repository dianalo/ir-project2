(product development).andO;Topic:     InterfaceCompatible SoftwareApplications ProgrammingProduct Development.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dan RubyandM;Carlsbad, Calif.andP;  -- Claris Corp. last week demonstrated interprocesscommunication (IPC) between two of its applications running under MultiFinderin System 6.andM;A similar capability is one of the key features Apple will deliver in System7.0, due sometime next year (see related story, right).andM;Claris officials said that the technology is not meant to compete withApple's implementation but to allow its own and other companies' developersto get a head start on building links between their applications.andM;&quot;We are not about system development,&quot; said Claris President Bill Campbell.andO;&quot;This is a prototype of a next-generation function that lets us dream inadvance about the ways applications can work together.&quot;andM;The demonstration made use of IPC code licensed from UserLand Corp. of SanMateo, Calif., and an application program interface (API) that Claris said itbuilt to Apple's announced Apple-Events specification.andM;The UserLand IPC is a low-level mechanism allowing messages to be passed backand forth.andP;  AppleEvents is a higher-level interface that lets individualapplications control the functions of others.andM;The demonstration was given here at Agenda '90, a conference of industryluminaries at which Yogan Dalal, Claris vice president of productdevelopment, issued a call for greater cooperation among software developers.andO;&quot;None of us provide all the products our customers need.andP;  We have to providethe ability for average users to orchestrate their applications workingtogether,&quot; Dalal said.andM;In the demo, Claris CAD and FileMaker were linked in a bill-of-materialsapplication.andP;  Changes made in the CAD drawing were automatically updated inthe database reports.andP;  In another example, cities selected on a map drawn inClaris CAD were filtered by population data in FileMaker.andP;  The resultingselection was immediately displayed on the map.andM;Each application had several new menu options to allow cross-applicationoperations.andM;After viewing the demonstration, Randy Battat, Apple vice president ofproduct development, said, &quot;It is good that Claris is pushing the envelope tocreate better applications.andP;  Our only concern is that this stuff workstransparently when we ship System 7.0.andP;  We don't want a lot of differentimplementations.&quot;andM;According to Dalal, it will be easy to swap in Apple's System 7.0 code whenthe company supplies it.andP;  &quot;This is IAC as Apple will provide it but workingunder System 6.0.andP;  We will refine our API as Apple discloses more details.andO;We expect it to be identical.&quot;andM;Dalal said that the company would consider shipping the product only ifSystem 7.0 is seriously delayed.andM;&quot;If the window is small, then there is no sense duplicating Apple's work.andP;  Ifthe window is long, then we may introduce it,&quot; he said.andM;UserLand and Claris are holding discussions about offering their combinedtechnology to other developers.andM;&quot;The message is that you don't need System 7.0 to do IPC,&quot; said Dave Winer,UserLand president.andP;  &quot;Developers who wait will find that their competitorsdidn't.&quot;andM;Among developers interested in using the technology to prototype applicationsfor System 7.0 is Aldus President Paul Brainerd.andM;&quot;Apple provides the plumbing, but it is only when you put the water throughit that you discover what the problems are.andP;  This could give us a head startin that process,&quot; Brainerd said.andM;He added that he sees good possibilities for linking PageMaker with Claris'MacWrite II and FileMaker products.andM;&quot;We aren't doing this out of benevolence,&quot; Campbell said.andP;  &quot;The benefit to usis that our applications will be at the core.&quot; n</TEXT></DOC>
