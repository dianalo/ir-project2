The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which swung in a range of more than 20 points during the session, closed with a gain of 5.87 at 2156.83. &quot;This market is so volatile and so thin that it just doesn't take anything to knock it down and move it back up,&quot; one New York-based trader said.    Rumors circulated through the market in midafternoon that a story was in the works saying that Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, a lawyer, had someone else take his bar exam for him.    The unsubstantiated rumors resulted in a short-lived sell-off that pushed stocks to their session lows. At that point, the market began a gradual comeback, and traders said the recovery accelerated in the final half-hour because of a round of futures-related buying.    As has been the case so far this week, blue-chip issues generally performed better than the broad market. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index closed unchanged at 279.06, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index rose 0.02 to 262.12 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.02 to 157. Also, some 771 issues declined in price on the Big Board; 668 issues were up.    The pace of trading activity picked up somewhat, traders said, but remained modest as many participants continued to wait for tomorrow's release of October unemployment data and next Tuesday's presidential election. Big Board volume totaled 161,300,000 shares, up from 151,250,000 Tuesday.    In addition to the Quayle rumor, there was talk among traders that First Boston's arbitrage unit was on the sell side of a number of trades involving takeover-related stocks, including Polaroid, Interco, Pennwalt and RJR Nabisco. Brett Hare, the firm's head of arbitrage trading, declined comment.    While the market overall remained in neutral, Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott, Philadelphia, said the ongoing strength in what he called &quot;name brand, quality stocks&quot; is a sign that a renewed rally could lie ahead.    &quot;I'm most inclined to settle for the fact that this is going to be a narrow advance, but there is good leadership among the blue chips,&quot; Mr. Peroni said. He noted that a number of the 30 issues in the Dow Jones industrials were among the market's best performers during its rally from the lows of late August to the highs reached in late October.    On the other hand, analysts said the drop in the dollar raises the issue of whether the Federal Reserve will act to push interest rates higher to support the currency, which would hurt stocks.    Hugh A. Johnson Jr., chief investment strategist at First Albany Corp., Albany, N.Y., said there has been a widespread belief that the perceived slowdown in the economy recently would prompt the Fed to lower rates, rather than raise them.    &quot;The reason you're getting a lot of jitters right now or a lack of direction is because that view is being severely tested,&quot; he said, adding that the Fed doesn't appear to have the room to ease monetary policy and lower short-term rates at the moment. &quot;It's very, very unnerving.&quot;    Top performers among blue-chip issues included Merck, which gained 1 3/4 to 59; Union Carbide, which added 3/4 to 25 3/4; Texaco, which rose 1 1/4 to 48 1/8, and General Electric, which went up 7/8 to 44 5/8. On the negative side, International Business Machines fell 1 1/8 to 122 7/8, Eastman Kodak dropped 1 3/8 to 46 1/8, Boeing eased 1 1/8 to 63 3/4 and F.W. Woolworth slid 1 to 52 3/8.    A sharp jump in gold prices pushed gold stocks higher. Newmont Gold climbed 2 3/8 to 35 1/4, ASA Ltd. added 2 3/8 to 40 1/2, Hecla Mining rose 1 1/8 to 14 3/8 and Battle Mountain Gold went up 1/2 to 15 3/4. However, Atlas Corp. fell 1 3/4 to 33 after Blasius Industries terminated its proxy fight for control of the board and a non-binding resolution that the company be sold for at least $50 a share.    Phelps Dodge, another mining company, added 1 7/8 to 49 1/2. The company doubled its dividend to 40 cents a share, said it will buy back as many as three million shares, and boosted its copper price by five cents a pound, to $1.58. The increase was the fourth in the past week.    Sears Roebuck, up 1 1/4 to 43, was in the spotlight as takeover rumors continued to circulate yesterday. Late in the day, Sears stock soared in third-market trading on rumors of a takeover bid.    Macmillan Inc. rose 1 1/4 to 89 1/2 as British publisher Robert Maxwell received a favorable court ruling in his battle to gain control of the company. The decision, which reversed an earlier ruling, bars the company from selling four divisions to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts if KKR's agreement to acquire Macmillan falls through.    RJR Nabisco, whose board said it is seeking takeover proposals from any interested bidders, added 1 3/4 to 86 3/4. The company's management has already expressed an interest in a leveraged buy-out, and KKR has since launched a $90-a-share offer for RJR.    Reebok International gained 1 1/8 to 14 1/8 on a report that its management may take the company private at $18 to $20 a share. In response, the company said it hasn't hired any investment bankers and isn't holding talks with anyone regarding a buy-out.    Cabot climbed 1 1/2 to 38 3/4. An analyst at Morgan Keegan told investors that he believes the company may sell &quot;a substantial part of its energy business&quot; to remove any threat of a takeover from GAF, which holds a 4.9% stake in the company.    Continental Corp., which reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings, dropped 1 5/8 to 39 1/4. The company recorded net income from continuing operations of 54 cents a share for the quarter, down from $1.25 a year earlier. Lower earnings also hurt CNA Financial, which slid 1 5/8 to 61 1/8; its third-quarter net from operations fell to $1.40 a share from $1.78 in the year-earlier period.    The American Stock Exchange Index rose 0.27 to 299.83. Volume was 8,580,000 shares.    Sterling Electronics, which declared its first common-stock dividend since July 1966, jumped 1 to 5 3/8. The dividend amounts to two cents a share and will be paid in January 1989.    Mountain Medical Equipment gained 1 3/8 to 10 5/8. The company is holding meetings with investors this week to discuss recent product introductions and its financial performance over the past year. </TEXT></DOC>
