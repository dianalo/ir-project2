Chris Ball, 49, was one of several prominent South Africanbusinessmen who flew to Lusaka, Zambia, in 1985 for talks withleaders of the outlawed African National Congress, which is waging abombing and sabotage campaign to overthrow the white minoritygovernment.   Another member of the business delegation, Tony Bloom, emigratedto Britain a year ago, quitting his job as chief executive of thePremier Group conglomerate.   Ball, who has maintained open contacts with militant blackleaders, said he was going abroad for ``personal and societalreasons.''   ``You know what my views are. You can look them up all over theplace.'' he told Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper.   First National Bank, formerly Barclays of South Africa, saidMonday that Ball's resignation was effective immediately. Details ofhis new job were not immediately disclosed, pending an announcementby his new employers.   In 1987, Ball became entangled in a bitter confrontation withPresident P.W. Botha in connection with newspaper advertisementsthat called for ending the ban on the ANC.   Speaking in Parliament, Botha suggested Ball had funded thenewspaper ads. Ball challenged Botha to repeat the remark outsideParliament, where he would not have immunity from prosecution forslander.   Botha subsequently appointed a Supreme Court judge to conduct aninquiry in the matter. The judge concluded that Ball had lied whenhe denied knowing that a loan he had approved would be used to payfor the advertisement.   Business Day, in an editorial today, said both Ball and Bloom``took up advance positions as opponents of apartheid.''   ``The corporate executive who gets too far ahead of the crowdruns some severe risks, not the least of which may bedisillusionment and personal exhaustion,'' it said. ``Fightingapartheid can be a lonely business.''   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Ball joined Barclays of South Africa in 1973 and became managingdirector in 1984. In 1987, the bank's parent company in Britain soldits shares, and the South African management changed the bank's nameto First National Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
