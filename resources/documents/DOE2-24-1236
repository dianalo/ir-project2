<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-1236 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates with a pot-type catalyst carrier which excels asa catalyst carrier when such heavy oils as ordinary pressure distillationresidue, oil sand oil, and shale oil are decomposed or treated by hydrogenation.The conventional pot-type carrier is produced by dropping a small dropof a slurry (containing a catalyst component) onto a particle bed anddrying it. But the demerit is a large particle size and less catalystactivity or strength. In this invention, a mixture of such carrier componentsas allophane, red mud, bauxite and latellite, etc.. 60 - 80 weight parts.and a binder 20 - 40 weight parts is added with water to form a slurryof 10 - 30 weight% solid concentration. Slurry is wet-crushed to makethe average particle size 0.6 - 2.0 micron, then spray-dried and burnedto obtain a pot-type catalyst carrier with average particle size 30 -200 micron and abrasion index below 10. This catalyst showed high yieldof kerosene and light oil in the hydrogenation of heavy oil, and excelledalso in the abrasion resistance. (4 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
