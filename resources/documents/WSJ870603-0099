The small rise in orders followed a revised 2.6% increase in March. It reflected a sharp 8.1% gain in defense orders, which tend to be highly volatile from month to month -- they surged 43.2% in March. Excluding military orders, factory orders declined 0.2% in April and rose 1.1% in March. Previously, the department estimated that the March gain in overall orders was 2.3%.    &quot;When you subtract the defense orders, the figures show that the manufacturing sector is basically sluggish,&quot; said Richard Peterson, senior vice president and economist at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago.    Sara Johnson, senior economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said the slight April increase in orders &quot;signals a period of slower growth.&quot; However, Ms. Johnson said continued strength in orders for non-defense capital goods suggests that the adverse effects of federal-tax overhaul are wearing off. Such orders, which generally are a good barometer of future business investment, climbed 0.8% in April following a 2% rise in March.    The April increase brought total orders to an adjusted $199.80 billion compared with $199.40 billion in March. The April gain was the sixth rise in the past eight months.    Orders for durable goods were unchanged in April after rising 4.2% in March. In an earlier report, the department said April durable orders were up 0.1%.    There was offsetting movement in several durable goods categories. Electrical machinery rose 19.3%, mainly because of defense communication equipment. But transportation equipment orders declined 7.6% with all subcategories decreasing.    Nondurable goods orders rose 0.4% in April after rising 0.8% in March.    The April increase in home sales, to an annual rate of 777,000 units, follows a revised 2.7% drop in March to a rate of 722,000. Previously, the department said March sales fell 3.6%.    Many analysts contend the April rise was a temporary surge reflecting home buyers' attempts to get into the market before interest rates rise further. Home mortgage rates have increased sharply since early April.    &quot;It was a perverse reaction and what we expected,&quot; said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the Washington-based National Council of Savings Institutions. He cautioned that sales will decline sharply in coming months.    Mark O'Brinsky, economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, called the rise in home sales &quot;a very common phenomenon. When interest rates flare up, so does buying activity.&quot; Mr. O'Brinsky noted that the April gain offset March's decline.    In April, home sales rose in all regions. The biggest increase was in the Midwest, where sales increased 26% to a rate of 129,000 after falling 23% in March. The smallest rise was in the Northeast where sales posted a 2.3% increase after being unchanged in March.    Overall, the April rise in home sales was the biggest since an increase of 11.1% in December 1986. However, the April sales rate was still 12% below the year-earlier level.    The department said the average price for a new home fell 2% in April to $118,800 from $121,200 in March. The median price was unchanged at $99,000. The department said there was a 5.4-month supply of unsold houses last month, down from a six-month supply in March.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variation. Unadjusted, home sales in April totaled 76,000, up from 71,000 in March.    Manufacturer's shipments dropped 1% in April to the seasonally adjusted $195.47 billion after rising 0.9% to $197.43 billion in March.    Factory inventories in April rose 0.2% to $320.80 billion after falling 0.1% to $320.09 billion in March. Unfilled orders rose 1.2% to $375.55 billion in April following a 0.5% March increase to $371.22 billion.    Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for factory orders in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.
