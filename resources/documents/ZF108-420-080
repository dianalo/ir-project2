(corporate information management) (Editorial) (editorial)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>CIMandM;The Defense Department's corporate information management (CIM) program hasengendered a good amount of skepticism among Pentagon watchers.andP;  And who canblame them?andP;  They wonder whether this is just one more DODwide policy for ADPor telecommunications that sounds great but stumbles because of internalopposition, interservice rivalries or changes in top management.andM;We prefer to look at CIM with a hopeful eye, believing officials at DOD, likethose at many other government departmens, finally have come to terms withseveral truths: Workloads dependent on information technology will continueto grow, but funds for acquiring the technology are finite.andP;  Also, systemsbased on that technology will continue to proliferate to the point thatwithout simplification and standardization they will become unmanageable.andM;Recognizing these facts, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood recentlymandated CIM, a program that has given birth to several working groupslooking at DOD's financial, payroll, warehousing, medical, personnel,material management, contract payment and management systems.andM;The object is to find ways to consolidate systems and standardize futuresystems throughout the Defense Department.andP;  In case anyone missed the point,Atwood set up an advisory panel headed by a top information managementofficial at General Motors Corp., whose job it seems is to put the&quot;corporate&quot; in corporate information management.andM;CIM will save DOD as much as $2 billion over the next five years, accordingto Cynthia Kendall, the department's deputy comptroller for informationresources management.andM;Skeptics warn that if DOD tries to make massive systems changes or congregatehundreds of procurements into several &quot;grand design&quot; projects, it likely willend up producing more billion-dollar boondoggles.andM;Kendall and company, however, seem to be aware of these dangers and from ourpoint of view are approaching the project in the right way.andP;  They are movingslowly; they are not asking Defense offices to throw out systems; they areseeking the best current systems with an eye to adopting them for wider useover time; and they are letting individual agencies make many of thedecisions.andP;  The approach is to provide the direction, the oversight and themoney.andM;Many will see in CIM a reprise of the less than brilliantly executed Adaprogram -- a good idea that took far too long to take off and still isseeking a firm hand.andM;But keep in mind that CIM, unlike Ada, has more widespread applicability andmuch more top-level support.andP;  The two, of course, are related; if it can savemore money, it will get more attention.andM;Most important are the two CIM attributes the Ada project always has lacked.andO;CIM has the strong support of the congressional oversight and appropriationscommittees, which have been calling for this kind of standardization andconsolidation for years.andP;  Also, the plan will be managed by those who controlthe money and are committed to make CIM work.andP;  This means not letting thosein the field wink at its requirements and continue business as usual.andM;So, CIM is off to a good start.andP;  It still is entirely too early to tell howmuch success it will achieve.andP;  Now it is up to DOD to silence its critics andmake believers of the skeptics.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
