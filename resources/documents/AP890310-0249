(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a backroads town where being a goodneighbor is as important as church on Sunday, the prospect of anuclear waste dump has spawned an economic boycott and discordantcivic meetings. It's pitted friend against friend.   In January, Boyd County, a sparsely populated agricultural areaon the South Dakota border, became one of three semifinalist sitesin Nebraska for a low-level radioactive waste dump.   ``It's the most tragic thing that's ever happened here,'' saidLowell Fisher, a third-generation rancher who's chairman of the``Save Boyd County Association.''   ``We're not anti-nuke kooks, we're not a bunch of politicalactivists, we're babes in the woods when it comes to trying to stopthis. But we live in God's country and we don't want everybodyelse's garbage.''   Fisher's group has garnered 1,107 signatures against the dump.About 3,000 people live in Boyd County, and 1,499 voted in the lastgeneral election.   But J.C. Marcum, a retired Spencer veterinarian who heads``People For Progress In Boyd County,'' is delighted the dump mightbe located within 12 miles of his home.   ``Outside rabble rousers have teamed up with local kooks tocoerce people into being against the waste site,'' said Marcum.``These farmers don't read very much, they aren't educated on theissue. They think their property values will be lower, but in factthey'll be higher, and we may get as many as 40 new jobs out of it.''   He criticized the dump opponents for boycotting businesses ownedby supporters. ``People I've known for 35 years won't speak to me,but that doesn't bother me. I've got a thick hide.''   About $2 million will be spent this year to study surface andground water, geology, topography, and environmental resources of320 acres in Boyd County, along with similar acreage in two othersemifinalist counties: Nuckolls on the Nebraska-Kansas border, andNemaha on the Nebraska-Iowa line near the Missouri River.   The dump is designed to be an above-ground reinforced concretevault capable of storing five million cubic feet of waste. Itslifespan will be 30 years or full capacity, whichever comes first.Radioactive refuse will be trucked in from five states.   The semifinalist sites, picked in January, resulted from amonths-long winnowing process. Eighty communities at first expressedinterest in the dump's potential jobs and fees _ an estimated $40million over three decades for local and state government _ buteventually almost all declined: Not in my backyard.   A dead black cat in his mailbox caused a Webster Countycommissioner to switch his vote from favoring to opposing the sitein his county. Letters to the editor got bitter and personal.   ``As long as our governor (Kay Orr) and state oppose the right ofthe people to vote on the waste site being placed in their county,''wrote Fisher, ``strife will only increase.''   Federal law mandates that every state have a dump for itslow-level radioactive garbage _ mostly tools, clothing and resinfrom nuclear power plants _ by Jan. 1, 1993. Most states are bandingwith others in regional disposal compacts.   Nebraska voted against hosting the Central Interstate Compactdump, but was outvoted by Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana,who argued that Nebraska ranked highest in generated waste andenvironmental suitability.   A referendum which would have made Nebraska the first state topull out of a compact was defeated by a nearly 2-to-1 margin lastNovember. The citizens' group that placed the issue on the ballotraised only about $25,000 to get its message across, compared to the$1.5 million spent to defeat the measure by the utility industry.   Political analysts believe ads warning that power plants could beshut down and hospitals might cut back radiological treatments ifthe initiative passed prompted many ambivalent voters to keep thecompact.   When Initiative 402 was rejected, US Ecology, Inc., the companychosen in 1987 by the compact to find a site and build and operatethe dump, forged ahead. The Louisville, Ky.-based firm disposed ofnearly half the nation's commercial low-level radioactive waste in1987.   But US Ecology's track record is a major cause of concern toNebraska's dump opponents because two of its now-closed low-levelradioactive waste sites leak.   Vice President Richard Paton vows US Ecology is committed tobuilding a state-of-the-art dump in Nebraska on a site that willmeet or exceed public health and safety requirements.   ``No one can make guarantees about the future,'' said a USEcology handbook distributed to Nebraskans, ``but through thejudicious selection of a site that meets or exceeds the sitingstandards, and the concept of multiple engineered barriers builtinto our design, the situation that occurred at below-grounddisposal facilities built in the 1960s are very unlikely to occur atthe Nebraska facility.''   The compact commission delegated siting to US Ecology ``so itwould be decided on technical merit,'' rather than politics, saidDennis Grams, director of Nebraska's Department of EnvironmentalControl, adding that his agency would ensure that US Ecology meetsregulations.   ``This process would have been a lot easier for us if the areashad been designated by the state or federal government,'' said USEcology's Paton, ``but I believe the controversy will die down whenwe show we are not out there to try and do harm. ...''   Even so, he acknowleged he's been threatened. One caller warned,``We'll take you out feet first.''   In acquiescing to host the radioactive facility, Gov. Orr imposed10 conditions on the compact commission, including ``assurances thatthe developer will not locate the facility in a community withoutthe community's consent.''   But faced with a groundswell of opposition in Boyd County, agrowing anti-dump coalition in Nemaha County, and the potential forresistance in Nuckolls County, the governor said in mid-Januarythere would be ``a great danger'' in letting voters decide whetherto approve the site in their own county.   Legislators, she said, will have to define ``what constitutessupport by the people of that area.'' Two bills requiring voterapproval in the county eventually chosen for the site are pending inthe Legislature.   US Ecology estimates it will be 12 to 18 months before a finaldump site is picked. Opponents promise to fight on.   Hugh Kaufman, a government whistleblower who's currentlyassistant to the director of the hazardous waste site controldivision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, spoke as aprivate citizen during a meeting in Nemaha County.   ``This region of the United States is being singled out as thenew major dumping area for America,'' said Kaufman. ``The nuclearand toxic waste industry is looking around for more naivegovernments and officials who don't know how to deal with it.''   Lowell Fisher believes all three Nebraska counties were picked aspotential sites ``because we're rural and sparsely populated, havelow incomes, are mostly above middle age, politically conservative,free market-oriented, have a high school education or less, andstaunchly patriotic.''   ``But we're not stupid,'' added Fisher, surrounded by anti-dumppaperwork scattered on the kitchen table of his farmhouse. ``We'vegot a lawyer, we're raising money, and we're getting smarter everyday.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tad Bartimus is the AP Mountain States regionalreporter, based in Denver.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, March 13</NOTE></DOC>
