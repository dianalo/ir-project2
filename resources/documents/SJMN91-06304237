While Fremont andNewark created alternative revenue sources long ago with major retail shoppingand policies to lure a large industrial base, Union City continued toemphasize expanded residential development.;   Large-scale residentialdevelopment does not pay for itself in the long run. The ongoing expense tomaintain residential areas must be subsidized from other revenue sources, suchas sales tax.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  UNION CITY HAS LACKED SOUND PLANNING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor.  </MEMO><TEXT>     For years, we've heard the shallow excuses that Union City needs morehousing to draw &quot;quality retail merchants.&quot; The sad truth is that Union City'spoor planning over the years has severely limited our options to attractquality retail merchants. It now makes no sense to have retail shoppingsimilar to that that exists next door in Fremont or Newark. This inexcusablelack of vision and planning still rules today, because of our pro-growth citycouncil majority. Houses are being built in areas once zoned for commercialuse, reducing available land for business and jobs.;   The city's latest&quot;solution&quot; is adopting hill development policies that could allow 4,500 morehomes to be built, while the developer pays ongoing maintenance for only 20years, for a project requiring 15 years to complete. Guess who really ends uppaying for the ongoing maintenance?;   Union City desperately needs qualityplanning now. On Nov. 5, we have an opportunity to elect officials whorepresent the people. Vote for Mark Green and Dick Oliver.;   -- Van Crandall;  Union City  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911030  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  260  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 30, 199100304237,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
