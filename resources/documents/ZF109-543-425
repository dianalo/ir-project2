 Printer prices havebeen falling but the differential remains.andM;Having opted for the cheaper route, many users eventually realise that, goodthough an HP-compatible printer is, it just can't do as much as a PostScriptprinter.andP;  As users become more experienced in DTP, they come to appreciatethe inherent limitations of a plain laser printer.andM;A compromise solution to this problem has been the bolt-on upgrade.andO;Originally this was confined to systems such as the QMS JetScript card, butthis was relatively expensive and required installation.andP;  A year or so agothe ground-breaking Pacific Page PostScript plug-in font cartridge made itsfirst appearance (priced at 549 pounds or 419 pounds for the LaserJet III).andO;It's now been joined by the JetPage International cartridge from laseraccessory manufacturer Computer Peripherals and the real McCoy, a PostScriptcartridge from its inventors Adobe Systems.andP;  Not to be left out of the race,HP has also launched its own Adobe-based cartridge for 517 pounds.andM;JetPage InternationalandM;For all the world appearing to be a simple font cartridge, the JetPage packsin the usual 10 typefaces and 35 fonts that comprise the normal basespecification of a PostScript printer.andP;  So you'll find Times Roman,Helvetica, Courier, Symbol, Palatino, Avant Garde, Bookman, New CenturySchoolbook, and last but not least Zapf Chancery.andP;  Note that these areequivalent faces -- they're not actually licensed from ITC or Linotype.andP;  Butthen this is a PostScript (v 47.0) emulator and not quite the real thing.andM;Unlike the earlier Pacific Page cartridge which required 2.5Mb RAM, this PSemulator requires 1Mb less printer memory -- 1.5Mb.andP;  As LaserJet IIs onlycome with 0.5Mb as standard, this necessitates the addition of a further 1MbRAM.andP;  JetWare does, in fact, offer the JetPage plus memory as a bundle with asmall price saving.andM;The JetPage International cartridge is available in versions that will run inHP LaserJet Series II, IIP/IID and III, the Canon LBP-8 II, Olivetti PG108and Siemens PT10 or 7500/7800.andP;  It will also support both parallel and serialports.andM;Installation of the cartridge couldn't be simpler -- you simply insert it inthe left-hand cartridge slot of the LaserJet II and turn the printer on.andP;  Thecartridge then assumes control of the printer so, instead of seeing the usualwarming up, followed by the ready message, you see Jet Page Int'l.andP;  Theprinter is now in PostScript mode and thus will only correctly print truePostScript output.andP;  Don't try a quick DIR PRN because it won't work.andM;Should you want to use the printer to print plain ASCII then you'd have toswitch modes.andP;  Toggling between PS and PCL can be achieved by one of twomethods: First via the LaserJet's LCD control panel.andP;  Incidentally, the oldmenu options are altered by the presence of the JetPage cartridge and aremuch curtailed.andP;  The second method of switching is by running a smallsupplied batch file which sends the appropriate escape code to the printer toswitch it either into PostScript or PCL mode.andM;After reconfiguring my software to output to a PostScript device I printed mytest files.andP;  As data is sent to the printer, so the LCD displays the job sizein Kb as it's received.andP;  I was disappointed by the speed of the JetPage whichwas the slowest of the three.andP;  Recursive graphics took a particularly longtime to process -- slower by as much as a factor of 20 compared to the Adobecartridge.andP;  A faster version equipped with a co-processor, called the JetPagePlus, is in the pipeline and should improve its rather poor performance.andM;Quality of output was comparable to both the Adobe cartridge and theJetScript card.andP;  All the test files printed out correctly from DOS although Idid experience some peculiar trouble with Ventura Publisher, with the Scoopand Capability test pages coming out garbled.andP;  Output from Windows 3.0applications weren't affected and printed perfectly.andM;A 5-1/4-inch disk accompanies the JetPage and contains a number of PostScriptdemonstration files, plus the batch files that switch printer modes.andP;  Noother utility software is provided.andM;A rather thin A5 manual is supplied.andP;  This was concise rather than effusiveand I felt it could have been a little more forthcoming about the wonders ofPostScript.andM;Adobe PostScript CartridgeandM;Brought to you by its inventor, this font cartridge represents Adobe's firstPostScript interpreter for the retail market, all previous offerings havingconsisted of licensing deals with OEM printer manufacturers.andM;PostScript is a rich and complex language and its interpreter has its workcut out converting instructions into 300dpi resolution output.andP;  For thisreason you find that all PostScript printers are equipped with beefiermicroprocessors -- many laser printers use a Motorola 68000 processor while aPostScript printer often boasts the more powerful 68020.andP;  So, any add-onPostScript adaptor doesn't bestow dedicated PostScript performance on yourprinter.andM;A quick look inside the cartridge reveals why.andP;  Apart from a PAL chip and acouple of logic chips, most of the cartridge is given over to eight large ROMchips which contain the PostScript interpreter.andP;  There's no processor and sothe printer's original processor now gets lumbered with all the extra numbercrunching that PostScript imposes, which results in slow performance.andM;Both the Adobe and the JetPage share many common features.andP;  Just like theJetPage, the Adobe equivalent requires 1.5Mb RAM.andP;  Installation was child'splay too: insert the cartridge and power up.andP;  The LCD panel is commandeeredand proclaims PS SELF TEST followed by DOING START PAGE.andM;The Adobe PostScript cartridge comes with the standard 10 font families splitup into 35 typefaces.andP;  Further PostScript fonts can be added in eithercartridge form or in downloadable soft font format.andP;  In use I found the Adobeperformed well--it was reasonably fast and the output quality was good.andP;  Iused it with Windows 3.0 and the GEM version of Ventura Publisher without anyproblems.andM;The 86-page manual provided with the Adobe cartridge was particularly clear.andO;Another bonus comes in the form of the utility software provided.andP;  Not onlydo you get the rather useful LaserTools Printer Control Panel, a TSR thatdetects PostScript output and then automatically switches mode at the printer(which is very handy on a network), but also Font Foundry.andP;  This programgenerates both screen fonts for Ventura Publisher and Windows 3.0 plus PCLsoft font equivalents of the PostScript ones.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
