The return of the cards is a victory for Israel's tightersecurity measures to control the uprising in the occupied lands.The cards apparently were returned because of the economic hardshiptheir seizure caused Palestinians who have jobs in Israel.   Israel began issuing the magnetic cards in June and bymid-August, all Gaza men were required to have a card to enterIsrael as a security precaution.   The issuing of the cars and the boycott of them declared by theuprising leaders severely curtailed the entry into Israel of Arabswho live in the Gaza Strip but work in Israel. About 50,000 Gazansworked regularly in Israel.   Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent Gaza lawyer, acknowledged that theleaders of the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in theoccuped lands had failed to pressure Israel to halt the magneticcard project.   ``Taking the cards from workers means imposing unemployment.They have no alternative. There are no jobs available in the GazaStrip,'' Abu Rahme told The Associated Press.   ``Denying them the magnetic cards means they have to starve,''he said.   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported Wednesday that workersin Gaza had banded together to resist by force the masked gangs whowere confiscating the cards.   The gangs hacked to death at least one Palestinian who refusedto hand over his card and threatened hundreds of others.   According to Yediot, the gangs confiscated 10,000 magnetic cardssince June. About 60,000 have been issued.   Arab sources said the activists stopped confiscating the cardstwo weeks ago and have since allowed Gazans to leave freely forjobs in Israel.   ``The authorities have won the battle over the magnetic cards,''one Palestinian journalist said.   Also Wednesday, an Israeli human rights organization, the IsraelInformation Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories,criticized the army's policy of demolishing the homes ofPalestinian suspects as ``a violation of human rights andinternational law.''   The army on demolished a Palestinian home in Gaza City, sayingfamily members were accused of belonging to illegal uprisingcommittees or of attacking alleged collaborators with Israel.   Human rights group Researcher Ronny Talmor told a newsconference that 236 houses were demolished and 98 were sealed shutby the army to punish Palestinians since the start of the uprisingin December 1987.   In addition, she said, parts of 60 other homes were destroyed orsealed.   ``In the West Bank, only in about 1 percent of the cases thesuspect had been convicted prior to the demolition,'' as comparedwith about 10 percent in the Gaza Strip, she said.   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 574 Palestinians inthe revolt against Israel occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip, and 40 Israelis have died in the violence. Another 121Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs, most of them becausethey were alleged to be collaborators with Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
