The commission said Delaware Otsego, parent of the regional New York, Susquehanna andamp; Western Railway, would operate the railroad's lines without federal subsidy for a period of 45 days. CSX Corp., Richmond, Va, has promised to back Delaware Otsego with financial and other support.    In choosing Delaware Otsego, the ICC sought to preserve railroad competition in the Northeast. An alternate proposal by Consolidated Rail Corp., a rival of the Delaware andamp; Hudson, was seen as likely to reduce competition in the region if Conrail diverted freight traffic to its own lines.    The Delaware andamp; Hudson, a subsidiary of Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., North Billerica, Mass., said it filed for Chapter 11 protection because its efforts to reduce the railroad's labor costs failed. An arbitrator's decision last week prevented Guilford from transferring the Delaware andamp; Hudson to a Guilford unit with lower labor costs. </TEXT></DOC>
