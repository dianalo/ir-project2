 We have a special review procedure, the Major Automated InformationSystems Review Council, for systems whose cost exceeds $100 million.andP;  Systemsbelow that threshold are subject to life cycle management policy but arereviewed by the individual services.andM;I chair MAISRC.andP;  We have a representative from Program Analysis andEvaluation, who looks at the system from the cost-benefit analysis viewpoint.andO;We have a representative from Operational Test and Evaluation [OTandamp;E] wholooks to see that it conforms to what should be done in terms of planning andtesting.andM;We have a representative from command, control, communications andintelligence who looks at it from the viewpoint of telecommunications.andP;  Wealso have a representative from the OSD, the functional proponent.andP;  If it'slogistics, it's someone from acquisition.andP;  If it's accounting, it's someonefrom the comptroller.andP;  If it's a service system, we have a servicerepresentative on the council.andM;The program manager gives a briefing geared toward the specific milestone,letting us know where he stands on the project, funding needs, cost,benefits, testing and so forth.andP;  There is a discussion to resolve any issuesand then the council meets separately.andP;  If we are aware of any problems weneed to work out, we do.andP;  Then we make a decision whether the system shouldproceed or not.andM;GCN: It seems as though there's almost a dread of MAISRC.andP;  Are programchanges inevitable?andM;KENDALL: It all depends on how well the program manager has followed lifecycle management policies.andP;  If it is a strong, viable program, then MAISRCwould say go ahead and proceed.andP;  But sometimes areas crop up that need alittle more attention, and we can direct that.andP;  For example, OTandamp;E mayrecommend that the test plan needs to be changed.andP;  One time we directed thtthe person in charge of testing be independent from the program manager sothere was no conflcit of interest.andM;GCN: One thing heard from program managers is that if the program isperceived as being over budget or late, it's much more likely to be cut ornot funded.andP;  One example is the Navy system called BASIS that recently wascut by the MAISRC.andM;KENDALL: Can I correct that?andP;  BASIS lost funding through the budget processthis past fall.andP;  But there was never a MAISRC council meeting held on BASIS.andO;And MAISRC does not cut funds from a system, it merely reviews and eitherapproves or disapproves that system at a particular milestone.andP;  In otherwords, it gives the program manager permission to proceed or not proceedbeyond that milestone.andM;Certainly, if the program is behind schedule, the funding stream should beadjusted to fit the schedule.andP;  If they plan an equipment buy in 1990 but itappears they are not going to execute it until '91, it makes sense for thedepartment to adjust the funding to fit what can be executed.andM;If it looks like the program has problems besides the schedule, it becomes aquestionable program and there are othe higher-priority programs.andP;  I don'tnecessarily get involved.andP;  But if we're comparing an ADP system against aweapons system, there may be other considerations to reduce funding.andM;Of course, you realize this past couple of months the department was underextreme pressure to reduce funding, and I don't know if anything got leftuntouched.andP;  I can tell you automated information systems did not escapeuntouched.andP;  We did take a fair number of reductions in ADP.andM;GCN: How many reviews do you do each year?andM;KENDALL: I would say maybe 12 a year, but it's totally dependent on when thesystems are ready for their next milestones.andP;  If there is a long time betweenmilestones, we may call on the program manager to present what we call anin-process review so that we don't have two years go by without knowingwhat's going on in a large project.andM;GCN: What is happening with the Industrial Interface Initiative?andM;KENDALL: The first objective is for DOD to compete successfully with theprivate sector in recruiting and retaining information systems professionals.andO;We need personnel development policies to achieve industry equivalency inqualifications, experience and expertise.andM;We have two actions in that area.andP;  We have requested a new job classificationseries for information systems managers that is being reviewed at the Officeof Personnel Management [OPM].andP;  I have to admit it originally went over in, Ibelieve, February 1987.andP;  We've had some correspondence with OPM thatsuggested we use a General Series 301 in the meantime while they arereviewing our request.andP;  DOD has gone forward with the request, so they've gota lot of research to look at.andM;We've been in touch at the action officer level.andP;  We really don't have anindication of how long it's going to take to complete their reviews.andM;We have a computer specialist series and a computer scientist series, butwe're looking for something that would give a career path.andP;  This informationsystems manager is a career path from a GS-5 to a GS-15, and one of the keywords is manager.andP;  Instead of technicians we are looking for someone tomanage projects in the Defense Department from start to finish.andP;  So we wantto set up this career path not only to help us by having managers in thedepartment, but by attracting people out there in private industry to comework for the department, as well as those graduating from college.andM;GCN: Is it possible OPM might not approve it?andM;KENDALL: That's their prerogative.andM;GCN: If you do get this upgrade, will it allow you to pay computer peoplemore?andM;KENDALL: As the request stands, it's merely a new job classification series.andO;It doesn't have anything special in terms of pay, it would be a GS-5 througha GS-15.andP;  I should have mentioned that the people we already have on boardwould have an opportunity to switch into this job series.andP;  I do consider payto be a problem, but we haven't addressed it in terms of this request to OPM.andM;There are separate avenues some of the services have undertaken in the payarea.andP;  I know the Air Force has looked into a way of making their promotionson, I think, a six-month basis instead of a year.andM;GCN: So the services are pushing for the same reasons, it's not necessarilycoming out of OSD?andM;KENDALL: Yes.andP;  I don't know if each service is looking at it globally.andP;  Ithink each specific functional area may be looking at it.andP;  But you can quoteme that I consider pay to be very much a problem area in recruiting andretaining information system professionals.andM;The second action I mentioned is providing educational opportunities for ourinformation systems professionals.andP;  You may be aware that last November thepresident of the National Defense University and the comptroller put out ajoint memorandum announcing major changes to the DOD Computer Institute[DODCI].andP;  One of the changes would be to rename it the Information ResourcesManagement College [IRMC] as part of upgrading the institute.andP;  But what we'rereally looking at is its reorientation.andM;DODCI's been teaching computer courses.andP;  There has been a need for that,obviously, over the years.andP;  But now we're at a stage where technical andcomputer courses are readily available from vendors as well as other privatesources.andM;What we don't have in our department, especially for those managing our largeprojects -- $100 million is not peanuts -- is courses to teach our peoplemanagement and life cycle management policy, our MAISRC procedures.andO;Basically it's managing large systems.andM;Last summer, DODCI did some research on what was available in privateindustry in terms of large program management.andM;The closest they could find was a course given by a university in Rochesterfor automated information systems up to $5 million.andP;  Well, that left a biggap.andP;  We have many systems larger than $5 million, all the way up to the $100million threshold, which we review.andP;  If a department is going to fieldquality automated information systems, we've got to train our own people.andO;What we're looking to do is upgrade IRMC to provide us that education andtraining.andP;  Part of it is upgrading the instructors to GM-15 level.andP;  Inaddition, the director is now in the senior executive service.andM;I'm really pleased about the progress they've made.andP;  John Carabello is thedirector for DODCI-IRMC, that may be the best way to refer to it, and they'vealready charged full speed ahead.andP;  There are seven courses offered in 1990,five of which are brand-new in line with the changes we want in IRMC.andP;  Two ofthe courses are carryovers.andM;Bear in mind they've dropped a lot of courses that were solelycomputer-oriented.andP;  We're going in the direction of management.andP;  And this isonly a start.andP;  They'll be adding more courses during 1990 and 1991.andP;  Theyalso plan to have a long-term course, eight or 10 months long, at graduatelevel.andP;  In the meantime they are folding some of this course work intocurrent courses, but the real courses are going to start in 1990.andM;They haven't promised when the name will change.andP;  Air Force Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  B.C.andO;Hosmer, president of the National Defense University, prefers to wait untilthey have the long-term, graduate-level course and change the name at thattime.andM;The second industry interface initiative is our feeling that DOD must becomea principal participant in the industry's efforts to develop interoperabilitystandards and in the adoption and implementation of those standards.andM;DOD probably is the largest ADP user in our country, and we feel we should bea strong participant in establishing standards.andP;  We are activelyparticipating in eight committees of the American National StandardsInstitute, and we're active in the International Standards Organization.andP;  Ofcourse ANSI represents the United States at ISO.andP;  So we're taking a strongrole there and intend to keep pushing forward and make DOD's needswell-known.andM;Hopefully we will take a strong role in setting those standards.andP;  That's sortof the non-governmental arena.andP;  We are also heavily involved in the federalarena for standards.andP;  Last year the comptroller recommended to the Office ofManagement and Budget setting up a working group to establish priorities forfederalwide standards.andM;That group has been established and involves OMB, the National Institute ofStandards and Technology and the General Services Administration, which arestrong participants federalwide.andP;  Our plan is that we will set prioritiesthroughout the federal government and those priorities will be used in thenational and international arenas.andM;GCN: What do you see as some of the major issues in interoperability?andP;  I knowthe Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile probably is one you areconcerned with.andM;KENDALL: Yes, we've adopted GOSIP.andP;  I'm not totally conversant with thedetails.andP;  But we have identified two areas that we consider our toppriorities that we'll be bringing to this working group federalwide.andP;  Thoseare application portability standards, which will provide interfaces forsoftware languages, operating systems, data management systems.andP;  Our secondpriority is open systems interconnection standards, which permit standardizedcommunication among different manufacturer's computer systems.andM;GCN: Is it a problem getting the services to agree on the same standards?andM;KENDALL: We got together with the services, I think this last summer, andcame up with these two as our top priorities in the Defense Department.andO;Obviously there are others, but we have a consensus in DOD that these are ourtop two that we'll be presenting in the fedralwide working group.andM;We also feel in DOD that we need to improve our ability to access industryexpertise and increase our use of it in the concept, design and developmentof new automated information systems and the modernization of existingautomated information systems.andM;We've taken two actions in this area.andP;  We've encouraged the individualservices to set up independent assistance groups so they can  accessindustry.andP;  Our concept is that if a program manager hits a snag at somestage, he should be able to go out and get help.andM;It will help if the services have set up an independent assistance groupwhere that program manager could come and access perhaps someone from privateindustry to help him get over a particular hump or an area of weakness in hissystem.andM;Our second action goes back to IRMC.andP;  It recently announced it isestablishing a technical assistance center.andM;IT's very new so the details have not yet been worked out.andP;  They have hired adirector.andM;We want to have a place similar to the independent assistance group where aprogram manager can go if he hits particular point in his program where herealizes he needs assistance.andP;  We haven't totally worked out the details orexactly what the technical systems center will provide.andM;We do envision that the center may also have access to industry.andP;  They shouldhave a certain amount of expertise right there in the center, but they'llprobably also have ac cess to industry.andM;GCN: Do you have a date in mind when program managers might be able to gethelp?andM;KENDALL:  Well, the technical assistance center has been announced so it'sjust in the formative stage.andM;I could say it exists, but it isn't in operation.andP;  I think it's going to beevolutionary.andM;Initially the help is going to be limited; it's just going to depend on whattype of assistance program managers are most in need of.andM;I would hope that between now and next year, there certainly would be somepayback in terms of establishing the center.andM;GCN: The independent group, the officials from industry -- would you recruitthem yourself?andP;  Would you go to industry and say, &quot;We're thinking about this,can you suggest something?&quot;andM;KENDALL: We've recommended that each service set up some type of advisorygroup.andP;  The Air Force already has a program in place.andP;  They completed somecontracts so they have some contractors available.andM;GCN: How does OSD determine which ADP programs will be reduced in funding ormaybe get extra funding?andM;KENDALL: Bear in mind that each service goes through a budget process, sothey have to priotize their needs and address their functional requirementsand then submit their budgets to OSD.andP;  At that point they've already donetheir own prioritizing.andM;Once it hits the comptroller's shop, we do a review across the entire budget.andO;In general, OSD is looking at everything across the board, weighing ADPagainst weapons systems and so forth.andP;  I don't get involved in that type ofcomparison.andP;  My office does take a look at the ADP systems and provide helpto others -- whether the program is reasonably funded and balanced, is itmeeting milestones, are they going to be able to execute that program onschedule based on what we know.andM;Largely we know about the major systems we review; the ones below thatthreshold we may not know as much about, but we do have some information.andO;Because we are involved in major systems we may also be aware of auditreports and findings from GAO that we may take into account when we arelooking at a particular system.andM;GCN: Does your office have a document that says which ADP programs are goingto survive the budget process, which are going to be cut, which are going tobe altered in funding?andM;KENDALL: Well, of course last April 25 the budget was released with therevisions, and that information is available.andP;  We don't have the kind ofdetails for these revisions that we had last January with the budget thatwent forward then.andP;  We do not yet have exhibits on the ADP systems for thisrecent revision.andP;  Right now we don't plan to require the services to prepareexhibits with the amount of detail required last January.andP;  I have asked themto prepare some summaries of documents so that I and my counterparts in theservices really know where we stand.andM;GCN: Is it hard getting the services to give you all the information you needto make budget decisions on these programs?andM;KENDALL: I don't perceive a problem.andP;  The services seem very forthright, andthey want us to know where they stand in their programs and how well they'redoing so that in a sense we could be a proponent for their systems.andM;GCN: I understand there is a new comptroller.andM;KENDALL: Sean O'Keefe, from Sen.andP;  Ted Stevens' staff [and former chiefminority counsel for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee], has had quitea few years' experience on the Hill and is familiar with the DOD budget andmany issues.andP;  He has worked as an intern in the comptroller's shop and alsoat OMB.andM;From a management viewpoint I don't foresee any changes in our procedures.andP;  Ithink he'll do very well very well as our senior IRM official.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
