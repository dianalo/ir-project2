Syrian authorities who received him refusedto confirm his identity immediately.   Singh, a resident alien of the United States, was set free at10:05 p.m. (3:05 p.m. EDT) near the headquarters of the U.N. Reliefand Works Agency for Palestinian refugees in Beirut, said a policespokesman who demanded anonymity.   The reported release followed press reports that Americanhostage Alann Steen was about to be released.   Singh, 60, a finance professor, Steen and two other Americanteachers were kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987 by gunmen posing as riotpolice at the campus of Beirut University College, where theytaught.   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine claimedresponsibility for the kidnappings. Singh's reported release camefive minutes after a deadline set by the group in a 36-wordhandwritten statement released earlier Monday to a Western newsagency in Beirut.   In Damascus, the minister of state for foreign affairs, NasserQaddor, said that an American hostage had been released and was inSyrian hands. Qaddor would not reveal his identity, tellingjournalists to return to the foreign ministry at 9 a.m. Tuesday, (2a.m. EDT) when the hostage would be handed over to the Americanambassador.   Singh holds an Indian passport but also has an American greencard, making him a legal resident alien in the United States.   In another statement released Saturday, the kidnappers said theywould free one of the hostages as a goodwill gesture to the UnitedStates.   The group said the release was designed to stimulate U.S.support for the 10-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel'smilitary occupation in the West Bank and Gaza strip.   Steen, 49, a native of Boston, was professor of journalism atBeirut University College. His wife, 31, of Jackson, Mich., is afine arts professor at the school.   The other hostages the group claims to hold are: Jesse Turner,41, a native of Boise, Idaho, and a professor of mathematics andcomputer science; and Robert Polhill, 54, of New York City,professor of business and lecturer in accounting.   Nine Americans are missing in Lebanon. The longest held is TerryAnderson, the chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress. He was abducted March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
