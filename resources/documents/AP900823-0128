Police arrested at least 32 suspects, officials said, and allbut three are members of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. Butthe government admitted it had no proof of their guilt.   ``Of course, we arrested them. If we didn't arrest them, howcould we be sure? Once we have a lead, we'll have an open-and-shutcase,'' Interior Minister Zahid Safraz told reporters in thecapital, Islamabad.   The latest round of ethnic violence in Ms. Bhutto's hometown wassparked by the return of Altaf Hussein, the militant leader of theMohajir Qami Movement, or Refugee People's Movement representingIndian immigrants from the 1947 partition of the subcontinent.   Snipers fired from rooftops into a crowd celebrating Hussein'sreturn Thursday, killing at least one person and injuring six,police said.   On Wednesday, marauding gunmen fired into a crowd preparing forhis return, killing at least 29 people and injuring 50, police said.   No one claimed responsibility for either attack, the latest in aresurging wave of gang warfare that has claimed at least 500 livessince late May.   Jam Saddiq Ali, the chief minister of Sindh Province, said 32people had been arrested in Wednesday's attack and 28 belonged toMs. Bhutto's left-of-center People's Party.   Jam said they launched the attacks to discredit the caretakergovernment that replaced Ms. Bhutto two weeks ago after hergovernment was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse ofpower.   About 40,000 slogan-chanting supporters crowded into KarachiInternational Airport and blocked surrounding streets to greetHussein, 36, who had been in London since mid-May undergoingtreatment for a kidney ailment.   About 250,000 people attended a rally Thursday evening forHussein. Police earlier said more than 1 million people wereexpected. All markets and businesses closed throughout Karachi, acity of 9 million residents that is the country's financial andindustrial center.   The Movement, which overwhelmingly dominates Karachi and othercities in Sindh Province, is demanding recognition as Pakistan'sfifth nationality, along with the Pathans, Baluch, Punjabis andSindhis.   For years, Karachi has been an urban battlefield between rivalethnic and political groups. Authorities estimate at least 2,000people have been killed and thousands more injured since violencebegan in 1985.   President Ghulman Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's governnmentAug. 6, citing its inability to stop the killings as one reason.   The Movement was once Ms. Bhutto's ally. But after complainingof broken campaign promises, it joined her opposition in lateNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
