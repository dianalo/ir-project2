Profit at several major U.S. drug makers is estimated tohave climbed by between 18% and 20%, reflecting the strongsales of premium-priced drugs, price increases and benefitsfrom a weakening dollar abroad.</LP><TEXT>   Securities industry analysts said high-margin productspropelled hearty earnings at Eli Lilly andamp; Co., Merck andamp; Co.,Schering Plough Corp., Warner-Lambert Co. and Bristol-MyersSquibb Co. But earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. wereestimated to have risen by about 10% or less.   &quot;Profit growth looks particularly strong {in the industry}when you compare it to performance elsewhere {in theeconomy},&quot; said Ronald Nordmann, a drug industry analyst withPaineWebber Inc.   Mr. Nordmann said that while per-share earnings rose about15% to 16% for the first half of 1990, he expected profitgrowth to rise even more sharply for the rest of the year,moving ahead by about 18% in the third quarter and 21% in thefourth.   Analysts said Eli Lilly's quarterly profit would jump thegreatest, increasing about 25% from the $217.1 million, or 75cents a share, reported in the second quarter of 1989. Growthwas spurred by explosive sales of the anti-depressant drug,Prozac.   Patricia Lea, an analyst at Vector SecuritiesInternational Inc., Deerfield, Ill., said Prozac sales, farfrom prosaic, rose during the quarter at an annual rate of$700 million to $800 million, up from the $320 million itregistered in 1989. The drug has received a boost from a hostof news stories citing it as relatively safe, with fewerannoying side effects than other anti-depressant medicines.   Eli Lilly's growth also was due to strong sales of itscatheters, devices used to diagnose heart disease. InIndianapolis, a spokesman said the company wouldn't comment.   Analysts believe Merck's earnings rose about 20% to 21%,due to continued strong sales of several products, includingits cholesterol-lowering agent, Mevacor; Pepcid, ananti-ulcer drug; and Vasotec, a heart disease drug. Merck,with a large presence in Europe and Japan, previously hadbeen hurt by adverse foreign currency translations as aresult of a strong dollar. Analysts said such translations inthe second quarter won't hurt drug makers with overseasbusiness as the dollar's value has softened.   In the second quarter of 1989, Merck earned $396.6million, or $1 a share. Merck, based in Rahway, N.J.,declined to comment.   Bristol-Myers was expected to post a profit gain of about20% from the $345 million, or 66 cents a share, it reportedin the 1989 second quarter. Analysts said the company washelped by the combination of sales forces resulting from themerger between Bristol-Myers and Squibb last year.   In particular, sales of Bristol-Myers' drug Capoten, whichcompetes against Merck's Vasotec, benefited from theadditional marketing clout. The company's antibiotic Duracefgained sales when a court banned the sale of genericcompetitor following a lawsuit over the drug's patent.   &quot;Bristol-Myers also implemented some very aggressive pricehikes for some of its products,&quot; said Robert Uhl, an analystat Salomon Brothers who tracks drug price increases. He saidthat during the quarter the company increased prices by 14%for the company's Squibb line of drugs and 17% for itsBristol Laboratories line. The New York company declined tocomment.   Analysts said profit for Warner-Lambert andSchering-Plough was expected to jump about 18% to 20%.Warner-Lambert profit was buttressed by sales of Lopid, aanti-cholesterol drug, while Schering moved ahead on sales ofProventil, an asthma medicine, and its broad line of otherprescription drugs.   In Morris Plains, N.J., Warner-Lambert, which earned$112.4 million, or 83 cents a share accounting for a stocksplit, in the year-earlier period, declined to comment.Schering-Plough, in Madison, N.J., which earned $120.5million, or 54 cents a share after a stock split, alsodeclined to comment.   Analysts said that profit for Pfizer and Upjohn areestimated to have risen more slowly, growing by between 8%and 10%. Analysts said the Pfizer earnings were damped bymarketing costs related to the sale of several new drugs, andthe analysts said the cost of several other productintroductions later this year also may slow earnings growthfor the rest of the year. New York-based Pfizer earned $135.7million, or 80 cents a share. It declined to comment.   Upjohn, which earned $94.6 million, or 51 cents a share,in the 1989 second quarter, continued to suffer from slowingsales of its leading drug products, Xanax and Halcion,analysts said. Even so, earnings benefited from a pretax gainof $35 million to $40 million from a pension settlement. InKalamazoo, Mich., the company declined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
