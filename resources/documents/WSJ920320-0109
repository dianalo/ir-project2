Saddam Hussein's artillery had just dropped poison gasaround Zakhu, once U.S. headquarters for the Kurdish securityzone in northern Iraq.   Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, hastily made keynote speaker inplace of Hillary Clinton, asks, &quot;Who lost the Kurds?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;George Bush,&quot; Mr. Nunn tells the world, his vote forsanctions over force long forgotten. &quot;President Bill Clintonwill never send American men and women into harm's way unlesshe's prepared to finish the job.&quot;   Far-fetched? Perhaps. Yet Saddam and his regime survive ayear later to torment the president who denied his dream ofconquest. And the allied security guarantee for the Kurds isset to expire June 30.   As incredible as it once seemed, it's now possible toimagine George Bush on the political defensive on the GulfWar this autumn, especially against an opponent who never hadto cast a vote on sanctions. Straddling Bill Clinton may havehedged on his support for the war, but not enough so that hewon't feel free to lambaste its unhappy aftermath.   The underlying problem is that Mr. Bush has yet toconsolidate the splendid military victory of Operation DesertStorm. Even before the war had ended, my editorial colleagueswrote in the space to the left on this page aboutEisenhower's World War II mistake of stopping short ofBerlin; they did not want Mr. Bush to &quot;stop at some Elbe inthe desert.&quot; Everyone hooted at the time, including, I recallsince I was the target, Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley ina TV exchange.   Saddam is the only one laughing now. His troops hung Shiasfrom tanks in the south, surrounded Kurds in the north andshot any coup plotters. Our State Department Arabists, sowrong about Saddam for so long, predicted he would fallanyway. Instead, Turkish President Turgut Ozal was rewardedfor his support of Mr. Bush with an election defeat at thehands of a Gulf War critic. Mr. Bush turned most of hisattention to the will-o'-the-wisp of peace for Palestine.   It's a mark of Washington cynicism that everyone assumesMr. Bush, down in the polls and eager to highlight foreignpolicy, wants another fight with Saddam to finish the jobnow. If only it were true.   Certainly no one in the administration would weep ifSaddam fell tomorrow. Some closest to the Oval Office wouldaccept even Genghis Khan, so eager are they to remove thesymbol of Saddam. Mr. Bush is also prepared to bomb Iraq'smissile sites if Saddam fails to comply with United Nationsresolutions. But beyond this possible and necessary skirmish,there are no signs of a change in strategy that might producelong-term stability in the Gulf.   Most officials expect, even hope, they won't have to bombSaddam. &quot;My guess is he will ultimately cave,&quot; as he hasbefore, says one senior official. In the Pentagon, there'sgreat ambivalence about the uses of another bombing. Anattack would destroy the weapons we know about all right, butit might strengthen Saddam by letting him again defy theinfidels. A surgical raid won't achieve the political goalsthat Desert Storm didn't.   How about the long-whispered U.S.-led coup, the &quot;Aprilsurprise?&quot; This is more sound than fury. Such talk satisfiescritics in Congress, but also gives Saddam incentive to killmore officers as examples. Cooler heads also understand thata coup might replace the dictator with another Baath Partythug, Son of Saddam. He'd have a weaker hold on power, butthe U.S. would find it impossible to maintain U.N. sanctionsagainst him.   These sensible caveats show how few options Mr. Bush hasgiven himself, short of a second invasion; meanwhile, Saddamcan still stir trouble. The new Turkish leader, PremierSuleyman Demirel, did a favor for Mr. Bush last December andextended what began as Operation Provide Comfort for theKurds for six months through June. He's said any futureextension must be voted on by his Parliament, which is liketrying to get past George Mitchell's Democratic Senate; itisn't likely.   The U.S. is lobbying to change that, but the Turks areunderstandably worried about angering Saddam again. Acommunist insurgency has grown in Turkey in recent months,aided by sanctuaries in Iraq (and also by America's newally-for-peace, Syria). But if Turkey no longer ProvidesComfort after June, the diabolical Saddam can be expected toharass the Kurds in the middle of Mr. Bush's re-electiondrive.   With so few options, maybe it's time for Mr. Bush tolisten to people who were right a year ago. AlbertWohlstetter, the venerable strategist who predicted what hascome to pass, now writes in National Review that Mr. Bushshould try &quot;overt operations&quot; on behalf of the Iraqiresistance. Support with aid and recognition the Shias, Kurdsand Sunnis who have shown remarkable organization both insideand outside Iraq.   This carries risks, but perhaps fewer than merely hopingfor some new benevolent Son of Saddam. Such a U.S. commitmentto freedom would do more than another bombing, howevernecessary, to pressure Saddam. It might also give Mr. Bush acredible reply to Bill Clinton.</TEXT></DOC>
