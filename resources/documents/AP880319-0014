It was and is a planned offensive conducted ... in clearviolation of international law and conventions.''   The urgent session was sought by Nicaragua to protest the UnitedStates' sending 3,200 troops to Honduras on exercises Managuacalled a threat to its leftist Sandinista government and tointernational peace and security.   The United States claims it sent in soldiers at Honduras'request after Nicaraguan troops crossed the border in an effort towipe out the U.S.-supported Contras.   Okun said the presence of U.S. forces was a measured response tothe alleged incursion that ``does not constitute either a threat orthe use of force against Nicaragua.''   Ambassador Jorge Ramon Hernandez of Honduras said Nicaragua istrying to create confusion and chaos in Central America.   ``We denounce this invasion as the expansionistic, aggressiveattitude of Nicaragua, not only to my country but to others,'' hesaid.   Okun added: ``The Sandinistas have been preparing for thisoperation since the beginning of March, moving equipment, vehicles,supplies, fuel and troops closer to the border and establishing aforward staging area within 45 miles of the Honduran border.   ``They apparently began planning this attack in reaction to avote in the U.S. Congress that ended aid to the Nicaraguanresistance.'' On Feb. 3, President Reagan narrowly lost a Housevote on continuing Contra aid. A Democratic alternative wasdefeated, 216 to 208, a month later.   The Sandinista government has said the offensive began March 8and had succeeded in driving hundreds of Contra guerrillas backinto Honduras, where they have base camps.   Nicaraguan envoy Rita Delia Casco denied during Friday's sessionthat Sandinista troops were in Honduras and said the United Statesis to blame for any conflict between the two Central Americanneighbors.   She accused the White House of being out to justify directmilitary action against Nicaragua: ``This is a crisis artificiallycreated by the U.S. administration ... The military actions we havetaken are limited to the defense of our territory and sovereignty.''   In Managua, a Sandinista military official indicated privatelythat Nicaraguan troops had cross the border. And Hernandez saidSandinista troops were still in Honduras on Friday.   Ms. Casco claimed the United States was preparing ``to step upits military presence on Central American soil.''   She said a U.S. Congressional delegation would be welcome tovisit Nicaragua on a fact-finding mission, including border areas.   ``If truly the government of the United States wishes to supportthe peace process in Central America,'' the Nicaraguan envoy said,``it is not by sending American young men to risk their lives ...It should put an end to its policy of state terrorism.''   Okun said the United States supports the regional peace planauthored by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, but claimedNicaragua has failed to abide by it by discussing substantiveissues with the opposition.   He said it does not want negotiations with the Contras _ buttheir surrender: ``The events which have unfolded in the past fewdays have confirmed our worst fears about Nicaragua's true intent.''   Ms. Casco said it is the United States that wants to block acease-fire and sabotage the peace plan, which calls for an end tooutside aid to insurgents.   She accused President Reagan of cynically employing a ``pack oflies'' and generating hysteria to help gain Congressional approvalfor further aid to the Contras.   The 15-member Security Council adjourned without a resolution orvote.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is considering aNicaraguan request to send a joint fact-finding mission with theOrganization of American States to the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.   The peace plan, signed Aug. 7, calls for cease-fires, democraticreforms and negotiations to end civil wars in El Salvador,Guatemala and Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
