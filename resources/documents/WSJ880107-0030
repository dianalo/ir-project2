The Bank of Japan continued to intervene in the foreign exchange market to buy dollars and prop up the U.S. currency. But most of the other central banks that had led the dollar-buying binge of Monday and Tuesday, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, were relatively inactive, traders said.    The dollar made substantial gains nonetheless, climbing 1.5% to 129.50 Japanese yen in late New York trading from 127.60 late Tuesday. The dollar also rose 1.1% to 1.6470 West German marks from 1.6295.    The dollar was stabilizing slightly below its opening in early trading Thursday in Tokyo. At midday, the dollar was quoted at 129.42 yen, down from 130.00 yen at the opening.    The U.S. currency was sharply higher earlier Wednesday on a report that the U.S., West Germany and Japan had secretly agreed to keep the dollar within a range of about 125 yen to 140 yen. Although the governments declined to comment on the report, West German and Japanese officials made strong statements in support of the dollar, which encouraged buying by bank dealers.    The dollar traded as high as 131.90 yen and 1.67 marks at the start of the New York trading day.    &quot;We're establishing a trading range of 1.62 to 1.65&quot; marks, Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;The central banks have done a great job of pushing the dollar back to its pre-holiday levels,&quot; he said.    The dollar plunged to post-1940s lows at the end of 1987 before the Fed, West German Bundesbank and Bank of Japan launched a new year campaign to reverse its trend.    Some global money managers have already begun to bet that the dollar's long slide since early 1985 is ending.    &quot;We think the dollar is too depressed,&quot; Gary Brinson, head of First Chicago Investment Advisors, said. &quot;For the first time in three years, we're hedging our non-dollar bond portfolio&quot; so that a rising dollar won't hurt investment results, he said.    Mr. Brinson said a $300 million international bond fund he manages has begun to hedge against declines in the yen, mark and British pound. The fund does so by trading in currency options or buying dollars for future delivery at current rates. He said the fund isn't hedging on the Canadian or Australian dollar, though, because he believes those currencies might strengthen against the U.S. dollar.    In its report about what it called the secret agreement on the dollar-yen rate, Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted unidentified Japanese monetary sources as saying the three nations had set up a $5 billion fund for coordinated intervention in support of the dollar.    Top government officials, meanwhile, continued to talk positively about the dollar and their efforts to prop it up. In a Tokyo news conference, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita indicated that he thinks the dollar has more room to rise.    &quot;I don't think the dollar's strong rebound is excessive,&quot; Mr. Sumita said.    In a West German newspaper interview, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said it has become clear in recent days that the Group of Seven nations -- which include the U.S., Japan and West Germany as well as Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- are serious about stabilizing exchange rates and will use all justifiable means to achieve that goal.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2.40 an ounce to $483.30 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $482.25 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                    Late New York Trading                    Wednesday, Jan. 6, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
