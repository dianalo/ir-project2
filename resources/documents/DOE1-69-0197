<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0197 </DOCNO><TEXT>There is a need within the Nevada Nuclear Waste Storage Investigation(NNWSI) project to develop three-dimensional surface definitions forthe subterranean stratigraphies at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The natureof the data samples available to the project require an interpolationtechnique that can perform well with sparse and irregularly spaced data.Following an evaluation of the relevant existing methods, a new technique,Multi-Kernel Modulation (MKM), is presented. MKM interpolates sparseand irregularly spaced data by modulating a polynomial trend surfacewith a linear summation of regular surfaces (kernels). A perspectivediscussion of MKM, Kriging, and Multiquadric Analysis reveals that MKMhas the advantage of simplicity and efficiency when used with sparsesamples. An example of the use of MKM to model a complex topography ispresented. 24 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
