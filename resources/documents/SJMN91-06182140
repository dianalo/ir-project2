Bills occasionally went unpaid. And she was notable to help her family in El Salvadar as much as she had hoped.;    &quot;It was asurprise,&quot; 28-year-old Alvarado said. &quot;I expected to come here and do fine.Not find so many difficulties.&quot;;    Getting tougher each year;    In this ageof federal budget trimming and disappearing social programs, stories likeAlvarado's are common. For refugees, it is getting tougher each year to learnEnglish, get job training and stay off government financial assistance.;   &quot;They get here and they're afraid. They have little money and children tosupport,&quot; said Emily Ozer of Heaven Sent, an East Palo Alto cooperativehousecleaning project for single, immigrant mothers. &quot;There needs to be analternative.&quot;;    Heaven Sent is one of several local agencies dedicated togiving low-income people -- especially immigrants -- an alternative to welfareand other subsidized living programs.;    The idea is for immigrants tocapitalize and market their skills, to become independent entrepreneurs. Theidea is to beat the odds.;    Alvarado did.;    Today Alvarado is anindependent housecleaner with a steady stream of customers. She said that, ifshe wanted too, she could leave the cooperative and run a housecleaningbusiness on her own.;    &quot;For now this is good because I can save money on bigexpenses,&quot; Alvarado said. &quot;But the cooperative has helped me establish aclientele.&quot;;    The project evolved from what was a women's support group.Group members decided in 1989 more had to be done to address theirgrievances.;    Turning things around;    The women identified their problems:chronic unemployment and the lack of English skills, transportation andtelephones. They reasoned that as a group they could tackle these problemsefficiently.;    Today the group has more than 20 members. The women have ahealth plan, regular advertising and an office. They offer classes and meetonce a week to discuss business.;    Although they work as independentcontractors, the women give Heaven Sent $1.50 for every hour they work. Themoney covers overhead costs for advertising, transportation and insurance.Customers are distributed evenly between the members.;    &quot;The program trainsthem to be autonomous,&quot; Ozer said. &quot;Eventually they'll be able to go out ontheir own.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Betty Cortina  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910630  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  434  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 30, 199100182140,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
