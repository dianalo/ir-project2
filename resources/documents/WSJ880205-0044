Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Organizers for Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts are talking with backers in all of Iowa's 2,487 precincts every night to assure that their support holds firm. Workers for Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois are mailing thousands of copies of an endorsement from the Des Moines Register to caucus goers.    Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, who retains hope that he might pull off a surprise in the first contest of the 1988 political season, calls the situation &quot;an impenetrable mystery.&quot; As the struggle enters its final weekend, any one of the top contenders could grasp his way to the top of the greasy pole.    But most of the late polls show Mr. Gephardt is the leader. And, as the candidates and their staffs prepare their final offensives, it is clear that Mr. Gephardt is controlling the political discourse in this state.    In the closing days, his rivals are assailing Mr. Gephardt, his record and his plan to hold out the threat of retaliation against U.S. trading partners. They are wagering that their organizational efforts can blunt the popularity of his message.    In the past month, the campaign has been transformed from a parade of quiet meetings in farmhouses and speeches in church basements into a blur of television images, and Mr. Gephardt -- who mastered the retail phase in the 132 days he has spent here -- has proved a master at the wholesale phase of the campaign on TV as well.    His late-hour surge began with a television ad arguing that foreign-trade barriers are so bad that a Chrysler K car costs $48,000 in South Korea. This week, in an effort to graft a feeling of warmth onto Mr. Gephardt's image, he began airing a complement to that spot: a visual poem consisting of flags, balloons, a scrapbook of American faces, a grand orchestral accompaniment -- and only 83 words arguing that on Monday evening, Iowa farmers and laborers might boast they &quot;changed America, and gave it back its soul.&quot;    These television images, squeezed between commercials for products to battle ringworm and to ensure corn stand-up control, are aimed at a broad audience. &quot;He's developed an image playing to a number of groups while reinforcing the appeal to the base of his supporters,&quot; says Michael Hawthorne, a political scientist at Grinnell College, east of here.    But Rep. Gephardt's support has experienced violent swings, soaring in the days after his trade amendment was approved by the House last year, plummeting into single digits in late autumn and then rising spectacularly in the early days of 1988. The danger for Mr. Gephardt is that his months of time in Iowa's small towns and his shimmery media campaign will win him many friends but fewer caucus attenders than a candidate like Mr. Dukakis, who has quietly built a solid organization, retained a large core of dedicated backers and experienced few swings in the polls.    The Dukakis campaign had regional organizations in place in October that the other campaigns are deploying only now. And, as the campaign technicians prepare the Dukakis supporters for Monday evening's caucuses, the three-term governor is embarking on a final offensive to portray himself as &quot;a man who can mop up Republican red ink and has done it.&quot; And, in an allusion to Mr. Gephardt, he is arguing that &quot;we can't build walls around this country or look for scapegoats.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis, who retains an urban and somewhat technocratic air that makes him seem a slightly foreign figure in Iowa, has been seeking to demonstrate that his compassion is as deep as his thought. Just as Rep. Gephardt was flying off to help lead the House fight against more Contra aid, the governor was attempting to rebut President Reagan's argument that the aid was needed to put pressure on the Sandinista government. &quot;Pressure has a human face,&quot; Mr. Dukakis said at Iowa State University. &quot;Pressure in Nicaragua these days is kids with their arms blown off.&quot;    For his part, Mr. Simon is arguing for a major new jobs program while stressing his differences with Mr. Gephardt and criticizing the Missourian for supporting the Reagan tax cut of 1981. &quot;He's made a great thing in his television commercials about rectifying the trade situation,&quot; Mr. Simon said in Waterloo. &quot;It was his vote that helped create the trade deficit.&quot;    And, as his organizers distribute 30,000 leaflets around the state and send 50,000 supporters post cards instructing them how to press for advantage at Monday's caucuses, Mr. Simon is brandishing the endorsement of the Des Moines Register. &quot;It fires up our troops -- and that may help if this last week becomes a test of organization, not message,&quot; says spokesman Terry Michael.    Meanwhile, Mr. Babbitt has taken a day to criticize each of the leading Democrats -- his harshest attack was reserved for Mr. Gephardt, who he charged &quot;consistently discarded positions which grew inconvenient&quot; -- before moving on to the Republicans.    Babbitt aides still are debating whether to open another front in their war against the front-runners this weekend by detailing the shape of the first 100 days of a Babbitt administration, including the possibility of naming former President Jimmy Carter, often regarded as an untouchable in American politics, as a special envoy to win a Mideast peace accord.    At the periphery of the late maneuvering are the Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose efforts to build a competitive organization have lagged, and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado, who retains strong name identification but has scant organization and is expected to fare poorly. Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, attempting to make a virtue out of necessity, abandoned his campaign here to concentrate on the Southern states that hold primaries on March 8.    The only candidate whose efforts here haven't taken on a sense of frantic urgency is Mr. Dukakis, who knows that next week the campaign moves to the friendlier territory of New Hampshire. But for Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Simon and the rest, Iowa performs the function of a high hurdle in the political marathon: Stumble here and your campaign is crippled.
