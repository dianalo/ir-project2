 It is based on asimple concept: all presentation materials are represented digitally andstored together on a random-access device such as a hard disk or CD-ROM, andaccessed directly by the computer.andM;CD-ROM is becoming more commonly used as an inexpensive distribution andstorage medium, with a disk holding about 650M bytes of data.andP;  This meansthat a disk can store about 325,000 pages of text (more if compressed), ormore text than contained in the Encyclopaedia Brittanica.andP;  On the other hand,it can store only an hour of CD-quality audio, fewer than 500 high-resolutionstill images, or 30 seconds of uncompressed digital motion video.andP;  There arenow hundreds of commercially available applications using CD-ROM, mostinvolving text only.andP;  However, for CD-ROM or other PC-based digital devicesto become useful in a digital multimedium such as DVI requires substantialcompression of the presentation materials.andP;  Compression of text, audio, andeven still images is not new.andP;  But what has been missing until now is theability to deal with motion video--requiring both extensive compression andreal-time decompression of the compressed images.andP;  DVI's key contribution isto solve the motion video problem, completing the digital medium and enablinga host of new applications.andP;  A DVI CD-ROM disk on twenteith-century artists,for example, might consist of 20 minutes of motion video sequences, 1,000high-resolution still images, each accompanied by an average of one minute ofaudio, and still have room for 50,000 pages of text (see Figure 1).andM;Two other digitally based technologies under development are CD-XA and CD-I.andO;CD-XA is a CD-ROM extension being designed by Microsoft, Sony, and Philips tosupport digital audio and still images (see TableI).andP;  CD-I is also a digital,CD-ROM-based system, being developed primarily by Philips as a consumerplayer.andP;  It has limited motion video and still image compressioncapabilities.andP;  It was announced in 1986, and was in beta test by Spring 1989.andO;Interactive video-disk is another related technology, using an analogapproach.andP;  It has been available since the early 1980s, and is supplied inthe U.S.andP;  primarily by Pioneer, Sony, and IBM.andP;  Videodisc has been theprincipal technology used in interactive audio/video applications.andM;DVI capability is implemented today as a collection of plug-in boards, andwill be commercially available mid-1989 in an IBM PC/AT-compatible computer(called the Pro750 Application Development Platform).andP;  Development began in1983 at RCA's David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, NJ, and resultswere first publically demonstrated in 1987.andP;  In 1988 Intel acquired thetechnology from General Electric, RCA's parent.andP;  Most of the 40-personresearch and development team (including the author) joined Intel as thenucleus of the commercialization team.andM;It is all-digital nature of DVI that responsible for both its power and itsimplementation difficulty.andP;  The purpose of this article is to expand on bothof these points.andP;  First we describe the components of DVI, the additionalhardware and software needed to develop applications for this medium, and theoverall application development process.andP;  Then we look at the uses of themedium by reviewing some DVI applications under development.andP;  The technicaldevelopmental challenges are described next.andP;  The conclusion diskussesimplications of digital multimedia for computing--pros and cons--and gives anindication of likely future developments.andM;DVI SYSTEMSandM;End-User SystemandM;A DVI end-user system consists of a personal computer containing three customboards and accompanying driver software (Figure 2).andP;  The computer is astandard IBM PC/AT or compatible machine, with analog RGB monitor, audioamplifier and speakers (which can be a part of the monitor), and standardCD-ROM drive.andP;  Applications typically reside on a compact disk (or harddisk), and include bothe the application software linked to DVI systemlibraries, and the video, audio, and other data required by the application.andO;DVI end-user boards will be available in quantity in early 1990, for both theAT and MCA bus architectures, in an optimized single-board version.andM;In the current configuration, the first of the three boards is a video board(Figure 3) containing two proprietary video processors.andP;  The pixel processorcreates the bitmap that the display processor sends to the analog RGB displaymonitor.andP;  The pixel processor runs at 12.5 million instructions per second,and its on-chip RAM runs microcoded algorithms from (minimum) 1M byte videoRAM.andP;  It was designed for general-purpose digital video and graphic imagecreation an manipulation, and contains special-purpose hard-ware to assist inreal-time decompression of highly-compressed motion video images.andP;  It canprocess 72 minutes of full-screen, full-motion video that can be stored withaudio on a CD-ROM, and more at smaller screen sizes or lower frame rates.andO;Graphics speeds are comparable to those found in high-end PC-based graphicsprocessors, such as the Texas Instruments 34010 processor.andP;  For example, thepixel processor can copy about 2.5 million 16-bit pixels per second.andP;  It alsoproduces realistic synthetic series by projecting photographic images onto 3Dcomputer models.andM;The display processor is capable of displaying bit-maps from video RAM in avariety of resolutions.andP;  256H (horizontal resolution, measured in colums ofpixels) by 240V (vertical resolution, measured in lines of pixels) is usedfor full-screen, full-motion video.andP;  Higher resolutions, up to 1024H by 512V,are used for still images, or motion video windows that are smaller than fullscreen.andP;  The display processor suports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit pixeldepths, and some special video modes described later.andM;The audio board contains a standard digital signal processor (TexasInstruments 320C10).andP;  Current audio algorithms deals with up to four channelsof compressed audio, mixing them down dynamically onto two output channels.andO;The resulting audio ranges from 40 hours of near-AM quality monaural on aCD-ROM to 5 hours of FM-quality stereo, depending on quality/disk-spacetradepffs made during the design of the application.andM;The CD-ROM interface board buffers data coming from the CD-ROM drive toreduce the number of interruptions required of the AT's microprocessor.andP;  Italso contains additional AT memory and a high-speed joystick interface.andM;Development SystemandM;A DVI development system is based on an end-user system with digitizer boardsand additional video RAM, a large hard disk for simulating a CD-ROM drive,and a removable large digital storage device (currently a streamer tapedrive; see Figure 2).andP;  Developers building applications use this system,along with DVI system software libraries, authoring tools, compressionservices, and standard program development tools (MS-DOS-based C compiler,linker, debugger, etc.).andP;  The development process is similar to that ofdeveloping any software package, in that an application is a C program thatinteracts with its user by way of input device(s) and a display screen.andP;  Theprocess becomes more complex, however, with the introduction of audio andvideo materials into the application, as depicted in Figure 4.andM;Video material is supplied to the digitizer from standard analog (NTSC)equipment, such as a video camera or videotape recorder.andP;  Once digitized,still images are compressed on the development system using the video pixelprocessor.andP;  Compressed images are stored on hard disk and called up on demandand decompressed by the pixel processor.andP;  Alternatively,commerically-available digitizing acanners, taking inputs from RGB sources,can be used to digitize higher quality still images than is possible withNTSC devices.andP;  A scanned image is compressed in normal fashion by the pixelprocessor.andM;Motion video can be digitized and compressed to hard disk in real time, usinga form of video called Edit-Level Video or ELV.andP;  This 10-frame/second videois lower in quality than DVI's 30-frame/second Presentation-Level Video(PLV), which must be digitized and compressed on a large computer at a DVIcompression facility.andP;  As the name implies, Edit-Level Video is very usefulduring application development for editing and &quot;roughing out&quot; the video,synchronizing with audio, etc.andM;The audio digitizer board connects to the audio board, and digitizes audiofrom any standard source, such as a microphone or audio cassette recorder.andO;Both audio and video streams contain embedded time codes, used for specifyingprecise edits and for synchronizing the two together.andM;DVI sysem software libraries contain C-callable routines that provide 2Dgraphics primitives, an audio/video support system, and a multitaskingexecutive that runs on top of MS-DOS.andP;  For example, the applicationprogrammer need not know the details of an audio/video stream residing onCD-ROM: where it resides or how--at 1.2M bits/second--to access it, separatethe audio and video, send the audio to the audio processor for decompression,etc.andP;  Rather, a single function call plays a specified audio/video stream.andO;The multitasking system is used by both the system software and theapplications program to simplify dealing with input and output devices inreal time.andP;  For example, a separate task may be set up to receive inputs froma joystick and notify the main controlling routine, eliminating the need forperiodic polling by the controlling routine.andP;  There is also a microcodelibrary of algorithms for video compression, decompression, video effects,line drawing, polygon fills, text, animation, etc.andP;  DVI hardware and systemsoftware are described in considerable detail in.andM;Authoring tools, sometimes called domain editors, are used for the actualdigitizing, compressing, editing, and playing back of audio, still images,and motion video.andP;  They also include a paint package for still image creationor touchup, CD-ROM layout and formatting tools, and tools for developers whorequire direct access to the pixel processor (a microcode assembler anddebugger).andP;  These authoring tools will eventually be accessible by authoringsystems, which are being designed and built to help simplify the developmentprocess.andP;  The goals of an authoring system are to integrate the domaineditors and to allow the designer to more directly develop the application,with less dependency on conventional programming.andP;  Authoring systems are inwide use today by developers of interactive videodisk applications.andM;MULTIMEDIA DEVELOPMENT PROCESSandM;The development process for DVI is depicted in Figure 4.andP;  The capturingprocess is very similar to that used for other audio/video media, such astelevision, cinema, or videodisk.andP;  Video may be captured on 16-mm or 35-mmfilm (and then transferred to video), or any format of video (e.g., BetaCam,3/4 inch, 1 inch).andP;  In general, we have found that the best quality can beachieved using Beta or 1-inch camera original.andP;  For example, the random noiseof film grain can increase the data size of a compressed frame of video, ifit is mistaken, and hence carefully preserved by, the compression algorithmas legitimate differences from the preceding frame.andM;Once audio and video have been captured, the various takes reviewed, andobvious outtakes sifted out, the remaining material is digitized andcompressed on the development system.andP;  Materials can then be edited down anddesigned into the application screens, and called up and played from harddisk by the developing application program.andM;Audio is digitized, compressed, and stored on hard disk in real time on thedevelopment system.andP;  For each audio segment, the developer determines thequality level desired, number of source channels, and whether to mix down tomonaural or stereo output channel(s) (see Figure 1).andM;A still image is digitized and compressed in several seconds on thedevelopment system using compression microcode.andP;  Decompression at playbacktakes a fraction of a second using decompression microcode.andP;  A number ofdesign choices are made during the compression stage, including image size(full screen, cropped, or reduced), resolution, pixel depth, and compressionfactor.andP;  All these factors together will determine the amount of disk spaceused, image quality, image load time, and decompression time.andP;  A commonlyused compression factor for stills is 12:1, which results in very good imagequality, yet permits storage of 12 times more images and 12 times fasterimage loading.andP;  A special case, &quot;loss-less&quot; or exact compression, is alsopossible, where no information is lost, and every original pixel isfaithfully recreated upon decompression.andP;  The cost of lossless compression isa much smaller compression factor (typically between 2:1 and 3:1).andM;Edit-Level Video is digitized (along with companion audio if desired),compressed, and saved to hard disk in real time on the development system.andO;ELV currently operates at 10 frames/second (i.e., two of every three framesare ignored), and an ELV image has a much larger code size than a PLV image.andO;The frame rate of ELV is a result of four factors: compression time,compressed image size, disk transfer time, and decompression time.andP;  An ELVframe is absolute, not relative to its predecessor, permitting easy splicingof video segments, playing in reverse, playing from a point within a segment,and other such useful editing operations.andM;Once the application is refined to the point of requiring final qualitymotion video, the developer sends to a DVI compression facility a 1-inchvideotape copy of original materials and an edit decision list, or list ofsegments to be compressed.andP;  The developer receives back compressed PLV onstreamer tape, and replaces the corresponding EVL segments on the hard disk.andO;If the application is to be distributed on CD-ROM, it is then organized andwritten to streamer tape and sent to a standard CD-ROM pressing facility.andM;Presentation-Level Video is not compressed on a DVI system, but rather,off-line at a DVI compression facility.andP;  For each video segment, thedeveloper specifies explicitly or by default a host of compressionparameters.andP;  These parameters are similar to those used in still image andaudio compression, and includeandM;* Compressed image size--depending, for example, on playback rate and howmuch room should be left for audioandM;* Decompressed image size--full screen, cropped, or reducedandM;* Playback rate--30 frames/second or, say, dropping every other frame for 15frame/second playbackandM;* Maximum decompression time--in order to leave time for other real-timevideo or graphics activitiesandM;Parameters are adjusted to balance image quality with other applicationrequirements, such as leaving enough run time to superimpose a videoforeground image over the background video or to animate another portion ofthe display.andP;  For example, a developer might specify a decompressed imagesize of three-quart er frame instead of full frame.andP;  This would allow forbetter image quality, more time for other video operations, and/or more spaceon the disk for additional video or other material.andM;APPLICATIONSandM;Applications for a digital multimedium span a wide range of uses.andP;  In thissection, we diskuse the possibilities, illustrating with applicationsdeveloped jointly by the Intel team and others during the research anddevelopment phase, and with some of the applications under development atbeta sites (see Table II).andM;TrainingandM;Many of today's computerized industrial training programs involve simulationsthat read users through interactive step-by-step sequences and procedures.andO;To be effective, training systems must provide students with realisticsituations and a high degree of interactivity.andP;  Often, graphics-basedsimulations are inadequate for real-life sessions and are unable toincorporate real film or video sequences demonstrating the training subject.andO;Realism is especially needed in such fields as medicine and aviation.andM;Because of its ability to integrate media, a digital multimedium has greatpotential in training simulations.andP;  For example, split-screen capabilitiesallow users to selectively compare images, either still or in motion, tostudy subjects ranging from cooking to laboratory procedures.andP;  High-qualitygraphics can be combined with video to allow an automotive repair student tosee and hear an explanation of the removal of a fuel pump, and examine andmanipulate a model of an actual fuel pump in another section of the screen.andO;The student could also select from a catalog of parts or get textualinformation regarding models, costs, and availability of fuel pumps (Figure5).andM;Simulation is particularly useful in creating environments where it isimpossible to film at all.andP;  For example, high-speed animation can be used tocreate an interactive, microscopic world, or to model the human anatomy.andO;Expensive or dangerous laboratory techniques can be simulated before they areperformed, both for teaching purposes and to minimize costly or potentiallyharmful results in an industrial or medical environment.andM;A safety simulation system for truck drivers is being developed using DVIcapability.andP;  It is installed in a full-size truck cab, in which all driverfunctions are simulated, with a DVI display providing views out of the frontwindshield and for both rear-view mirrors (Figure 6).andP;  First a larger,wide-angle view is decompressed, the portion of the view corresponding to thetruck's current lane position is selected, and then it is skewed to keep thedistant horizon relatively fixed.andP;  This last critical step results in smooth,real-time lane changes, and is an excellent example of the flexibility ofvideo in digital form.andM;Military training also makes extensive use of simulation.andP;  According to amarket study by Frost andamp; Sullivan, the complexity of modern military weaponshas created an annual market of $3.4 billion for simulators and trainers.andO;According to the report, nearly $18 billion will be spent between 1987 and1991 on this type of equipment.andP;  One developer is producing a DVI applicationfor maintenance training in submarines (Figure 7).andP;  Another is developing anair defense training program, in which the operator identifies and trackstargets through actual terrain.andM;DesignandM;Digital technology brings an added dimension to computer-aided graphic designmarkets.andP;  Texture-mapping, for instance, allows the creation of syntheticvideo from wire-frame 3D models by dynamically wrapping video textures ontomodels in the proper perspective.andP;  (DVI software does not yet support general3D modeling, although two pilots use custom 3D software to support syntheticvideo; see below.)andP;  An architectural designer can display a realisticrepresentation of a building without having to build a physical model, andcan easily evaluate alternative designs and building materials.andP;  The mediumcan also be used in designing animated graphic and video sequences forbusiness and sales presentations and in video production.andP;  One beta site isadapting a popular professional paint package for DVI technology, and expectsto dramatically increase the speed of such operations as shading andtexturing.andP;  Other developers are evaluating DVI as the basis of anall-digital audio/video post-production facility.andM;Information Retrieval and DeliveryandM;The delivery of information to consumers can take many forms, from corporatedatabases to on-line news services to retail point-of-sale kiosks.andP;  However,retailers have long been aware of the impact of motion video in advertising.andO;Shopping malls, department stores, hardware and grocery stores have all begunto use motion video kiosks to attract customers and to provide informationabout products.andM;Digital technology makes a whole range of new consumer-oriented informationservices possible.andP;  For example, video texture-mapping is being used in apilot DVI application, Design and Decorate, co-developed with VideodiskPublishing, Inc., New York.andP;  This application allows users to design a customliving room, selecting room size and shape, furniture, paint and wallcovering, and combining them with fabric coverings and room accessories ofchoice.andP;  The newly-created living room can be viewed from a variety of anglesand altered on command (Figure 8).andP;  On-line catalog information aboutfurniture and fabrics could also be provided.andP;  Design and Decorate has beenvery well received by both furniture manufacturers and potential users, andis expected to be commercialized as a point-of-sale system in furniturestores.andP;  In a focus session conducted in New York for G.E.andP;  in December,1986, furniture store sales personnel were very enthusiastic about its use tohelp their customers visualize how their choices would look before they buy.andO;This type of application can be useful as a sales tool in many other areassuch as landscaping (where trees and shrubs can grow to show plantingsrapidly reaching maturity) and automobile sales (where alternative colors andoptions can be displayed).andM;Travel and real estate applications can show motion video of locations tovisit or buy, accompanied by a database of attractive features of a propertyand 360-degree panoramas of nearby spots of interest, all under user control(see below for a description of digital panoramas).andM;Digital audio/video technology is also expected to become popular in thedesktop computing environment.andP;  Developers of powerful but complex packagessuch as word processors, spreadsheets, and CAD tools, are evaluating digitalmultimedia for use in embedded training.andP;  For example, a spreadsheet usercould open a window to get motion video and audio instructions on how to usea complex command.andM;EducationandM;Educators have long understood that visual aids can help the learningprocess.andP;  The need for interactive video tools, combined with a shrinkingteaching population, is leading educational institutions to establishlearning laboratories, where students can function independently.andM;Palenque is an educational discovery pilot codeveloped with Bank StreetCollege of Education, New York, for use by eight of fourteen-year-oldchildren.andP;  In this pilot, video allows the user to explore all the paths ofan ancient Mayan site.andP;  A multimedia database accompanies the travelerthrough the site, providing movies, audio, still pictures, and text about therainforest, the Mayans, maps of the area, and glyph writing.andP;  The database ispresented in the form of a museum, where different rooms hold differentinformation.andM;In Palenque, 360-degree panoramic views are accessible under full usercontrol at interesting points throughout the site.andP;  A panorama is obtainedfrom a single 35-mm slide shot using a 220-degree fisheye lens on a camerapointed straight up.andP;  The severe fisheye distortion can be removed once theslide is digitized using projection algorithms.andP;  The capabiity is usedextensively in Palenque.andP;  Figure 9 shows use of the fisheye lens in thePalenque rain forest.andP;  Figure 10 shows the distortion removal process.andO;Figure 11 shows the resulting panorama being used in Palenque.andM;As confirmed by extensive user testing, the computer novice using Palenquetranscends the complex interface now associated with many personal computerapplications through the liberal use of audio and video.andP;  Figure 12 showsPalenque's introduction, a motion video segment of the application's star andguide, C.T.andP;  In Figure 13 we are traveling down one of the site's paths.andO;We've asked for some help from our rain forest expert in Figure 14.andM;In the home, many educational possibilities exist for digital multimedia forboth children and adults.andP;  A Sesame Street pilot, &quot;Words in theNeighborhood,&quot; co-developed with Children's Television Workshop, New York,demonstrates how television stock footage can become transformed into anelectronic workbook for children (Figure 15).andP;  It is designed to use thesevideo clips in multiple independent video windows, selected differently andshown side-by-side in different activities.andP;  Testing has shown that bothchildren and parents find this application very appealing.andP;  Parentsparticularly like the combination of true-life realism and activeparticipation by their children.andM;DVI is beginning to be applied in higher education as well.andP;  MIT's well-knownMedia Labn and Virginia Polytechnic Institute are beta sites, and theSoftware Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University is developing atraining application for software code reviews.andP;  There the user selects arole prior to a code review: reviewer, reviewee, moderator, or secretary.andO;The other three participants appear across a table from the user's view.andO;Normally this would require shooting and storing the video of the threeparticipants four times, once for each of the possible combinations of thethree remaining roles.andP;  With DVI, participants are represented as motionvideo foregrounds, shot and stored only once on the disk, and dynamicallyselected and inserted into the scene, based on the role selected by the user.andM;EntertainmentandM;The 1990s will likely see a wide variety of home multi-media applicationsdesigned to entertain.andP;  Such arcade-style games as golf, flight, adventure,and mystery can display real video action while retaining the versatility ofanimation.andP;  For example, an early flight simulator pilot program, codevelopedwith Activision of Mountain View, CA, combines realistic images andinteractive response through the use of synthetic video.andP;  The armchair pilotfiles a World War II Spitfire airplane over a simulated English countryside,complete with engine sounds from a real Spitfire, Winston Churchillbillboards, and video-textured buildings (Figure 16).andM;TECHNICAL CHALLENGESandM;Most complex projects encounter significant technical challenges duringdevelopment; DVI was no exception.andP;  They are described here because most ofthem are generic to development of a digital multimedium.andM;Breadth of ChallengesandM;Not surprisingly, the greatest technical challenge centered around motionvideo compression algorithms and decompression hardware.andP;  The breadth ofproblems encountered was also a challenge, as it required working in manydifferent areas, with each area requiring unique expertise and stageddevelopment.andM;Electronics were first built up on oversized prototype boards, thenredesigned onto a board set fitting into PCs, and these are now beingredesigned again to fit onto a single board.andM;Up until early 1987, when we first had working chips, feature testing andsoftware work had to be carried out on simulation equipment.andP;  Initially thiswas a VAX connected to several very flexible Ilonas 3000 graphics displayprocessors.andP;  During the last year of pilot application development, we used aPC/AT connected to a frame buffer and videodisc player to approximate aspectsof the DVI system.andM;Early compression research was based on the assumption that the deliveryvehicle would be a digital version of the RCA videodisc player.andP;  When RCAabandoned this product in 1984, we switched to the compact disc player, andhad to nearly start over on compression algorithms: the CD-ROM player had adigital data rate of less than one-third of that of the RCA player.andP;  Thecompression approach switched from an absolute frame method to the relativeframe method in use today, and appropriate decompression capabilities wereincorporated into the chips.andM;System software was developed first for the video-disc-based simulationsystem, then ported to DVI hardware and the CD-ROM.andP;  Work on authoring toolsbegan in 1987, and on an authoring system in 1988, in part by outsidecompanies who already had similar products for videodisc- or PC-basedsystems.andM;Application work, directed by the author, began in 1983 on anentertainment-based pilot, and soon broadened to explore many different typesof applications.andP;  The development of applications for a technology thathadn't really been born yet was considered by some to be premature.andP;  But wefelt strongly that it was essential for providing feedback to the hardwaredesigners and to help us understand the development process for anall-digital medium.andP;  Further, it provided demonstrations of the medium'spotential (at times sorely needed to assure continued funding).andP;  Workprimarily focused on four pilot applications, which were jointly developed byour applications research group and the outside organizations who couldprovide the necessary subject expertise, market guidance, and user testing.andO;As with the system software, these pilots were first implemented onsimulation systems, then ported to DVI systems.andM;StandardsandM;Development also meant keeping up with, and in many cases redesigning to, amultitude of evolving standards.andP;  While this is undoubtedly true for manyprojects, it is interesting to note just how many standards were involved,and the complexity involved in attempting to be compatible with them.andP;  Themicroprocessor interface to the video chips was initially designed for aspecific microprocessor and then redesigned to be more general.andP;  Video inputand output signals work with NTSC for digitizer input and output to atelevision (required for a consumer version), RGB output to computermonitors, and PAL input and output for the European community (in progress).andO;Boards were designed for the IBM PC/AT, then IBM moved on to the PS/2 productfamily.andP;  A standard Sony CD-ROM was used, but had to have a custom interfacebuilt in order to adequately buffer data coming from the drive.andP;  DVI willsupport the SCSI interface to CD-ROMs and other devices in early 1990.andM;System software was designed for the MS-DOS environment, and incorporated DOSCD-ROM extensions and ISO-standard disk formats as they became available.andO;The 2D graphics package is loosely based on standard graphics packages,extended with video-related capabilities.andP;  We experimented with Microsoft'sWindows user interface package, but decided to develop our own interfaces(different for each application pilot) until we better understoodrequirements for interfaces to a digital multimedium.andM;Video Compression and DecompressionandM;By far the biggest technical challenge in developing the technology wasbreaking the barriers of video on a CD-ROM through the development ofPresentation-Level Video.andP;  The challenges were twofold: hardware andalgorithms.andM;We needed a low-cost VLSI chip set capable of decompressing full-screenmotion video in real time.andP;  The architecture is general purpose at the toplevel with parallel and distributed processing features.andP;  There are severalspecial purpose hardware accelerator blocks, for example to accomplishinterpolation of the U and V color components for each pixel.andP;  The chip setis fully programmable in order to process text, graphics, and video, and tosupport algorithm improvements over time.andM;Chips were developed initially using silicon-compiler technology, promisingfast turnaround of the first chips.andP;  But as with most software compilers,chip compilers don't generate the most compact results, so the next steprequired redesigning the chips using a custom design (analogous to working inassembly language for software development).andP;  This produces faster and morecompact (hence much less expensive) chips.andP;  This work is underway.andM;The second major challenge was in compression/decompression algorithmdevelopment.andP;  When digitized at 512 pixels horizontally by 480 pixelsvertically by 24 bits deep (8 bits for each of the red, green, and bluecomponents), standard television frame is nearly 3/4 of a million bytes ofdata.andP;  Thus, uncompressed motion video at this resolution requires a datarate of over 22M bytes per second.andP;  But the compact disk deliversapproximately 150K bytes of error-corrected data per second, some of whichmust be reserved for audio (for example, reserving 10 percent for audioresults in approximately FM-quality monaural audio).andP;  Hence each 3/4M byteimage must be reduced to around 4500 bytes, a compression factor of over 160.andM;DVI algorithms achieve this compression in part due to several distinctfactors.andP;  Perhaps the most interesting factor is pixel repreentation.andP;  Wetake advantage of the fact that in the human visual perception system,chromanance, or color, resolution need not be nearly as high as luminance, orbrightness, resolution.andP;  Pixels are represented in the PAL YUV format insteadof the more typical RGB (red, green, blue) graphics format.andP;  This schemepermits a reduction in image size while retaining surprisingly good imagequality.andP;  By only updating U and V every four pixels horizontally andvertically, and interpolating their values at run time, the average pixeldepth is reduced from 24 bits to 9 bits, or nearly a factor of three [11].andM;A further compression factor of four is achieved by simply decompressingimages to a resolution of 256 by 240, a factor of two in each direction lessthan that of the original digitized video.andP;  Finally, a sophisticatedcompression algorithm analyzes image correlation, both intra- and interframe,resulting in an image data reduction of a factor of 10 to 15 or so, dependingon the amount of action within the scene.andM;At a DVI compression facility, PLV received from a developer is first&quot;precompressed&quot; in real time--digitized from 1-inch videotape, filtered, andsent to a very large high-speed disk.andP;  Precompressed images are thencompressed on a parallel processor.andP;  The compression process begins with ananalysis of the differences between the current image and the previous image.andO;It is this difference that is then compressed.andP;  (Of course, the first framein each scene has no predecessor; such absolute frames are compressed toabout three times the size of succeeding relative frames.andP;  It is alsopossible to introduce absolute frames within segments, to allow for jumpsinto the segment.)andP;  This two-stage compression process achieves a very highdegree of compression, of the expense of non-real-time compression (thelatter due mostly to the differential analysis stage) [11].andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;What do digita multimedia mean to today's computer users and to computerprofessionals who develop applications for these users?andP;  In addition to theadvantages described above for specific markets, this medium can greatlyimprove the user interface for all applications.andP;  From our observations ofusers of the Sesame Street and Palenque pilots, and comments from theseusers, we know that full-screen motion video introductions and windowedmotion video for context-sensitive information are very appealing.andP;  Theyprovide much higher bandwidth to users than text does, and seem to set usersmuch more at ease than do the graphics, beeps, and text messages that we seein most user interfaces today.andP;  And these techniques are as valuable forexisting applications as they are for new applications being developed aroundthe medium.andM;Of course, digital multimedia application development teams must include awide range of expertise.andP;  DVI pilot development teams typically included aninstructional designer, video producer/director, and audio/video technicians,in addition to a programmer and graphics artist [12].andP;  Writers, video or filmcrews, and video post-production facilities were also involved as needed.andO;Documents such as treatments, storyboards, and scripts, while useful indeveloping graphics-based applications, are central to developing for thisnew medium.andP;  Smoothly functioning multimedia development teams, and the newdesign and development paradigms they create, will be critical to successful,sophisticated applications.andM;But DVI is just a first step in digital multimedia development.andP;  Newdevelopments are likely to include support of broadcast and higher qualitymotion video real-time synthetic video involving complex scenes and real-timecompression of presentation-quality motion video.andP;  Other platforms, includingconsumer systems, will appear.andP;  Mass storage media are evolving towardinexpensive removable read/write devices, with greater capacities andbandwidths than today's hardware.andP;  Input devices are being developed toquickly capture three-dimensional objects, such as furniture, elements ofoutdoor scenes, and even people.andP;  Speech recognition, language understandingsystems, and expert systems will all greatly improve user interfaces.andO;Authoring systems will become more sophisticated, helping to keep more of thefocus on what we are developing, and less on how we're doing it.andP;  Takentogether, these technological developments should help make personalcomputers of the 1990's and beyond more effective in their tasks, and moreenjoyable to their users.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;
