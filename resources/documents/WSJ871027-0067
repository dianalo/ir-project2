Wages will increase an average 2.3% annually over the life of the contracts, which generally run two to three years.    When these workers' unions bargained over wages two to three years ago, settlements resulted in first-year increases averaging 1.9% and yearly gains that averaged 2.5% over the life of the contracts. Generally, gains in wage settlements have been shrinking in recent years, reflecting continuing pressure on companies and unions to moderate wage costs.    Of the approximately 1,256,000 workers covered by big labor contracts settled in the first nine months of this year, about 68% had first-year wage increases, 6% had first-year decreases and the rest had no wage change for that year.    In manufacturing, the contract settlements will result in first-year wage increases averaging 1.2%, and in boosts averaging 1.1% annually over the life of the contract.    Settlements in non-manufacturing industries covered about 68% of workers under contract during the first nine months. They included first-year wage gains averaging 2.5% and yearly gains averaging 2.9% over the life of the contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
