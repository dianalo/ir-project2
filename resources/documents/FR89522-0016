The following major changes from prior laware noted:1. The definition of a major disaster has been amended to limit the qualifyingevents to natural catastrophes, except for fire, flood, or explosion, whichmay be declared for any cause. In order to warrant a Presidential declarationof a major disaster, the determination must be made that damages are ofsufficient severity and magnitude to warrant Federal assistance to supplementthe efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and disasterrelief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or sufferingcaused by the disaster event.2. The definition of an emergency has been amended to include any occasionor instance for which Federal assistance is needed to supplement Stateand local efforts and capabilities to save lives, protect property, publichealth and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe.3. Section 317 of the Stafford Act provides for recovery of monies expendedin providing Federal assistance when it is determined that any person intentionallycaused the condition which resulted in a major disaster or emergency declaration.This is a new authority not included in previous disaster legislation.4. Section 206.16, Audits and Investigations, has been included to reflectthe new authority given in section 318 of the Act. Section 318 of the Actpermits FEMA to (a) conduct audits and investigations necessary to assurecompliance with the Act, (b) examine the books and records of any personrelated to activity funded under the Act, and (c) require audits by Stateand local governments in connection with assistance under the Act whennecessary to assure compliance with the Act or related activities. Althoughthe provisions of section 318(c) would allow FEMA to supplant the requirementsof the Single Audit Act, and require audits by State and local governments,FEMA has decided to comply with the requirements of the Single Audit Actand not to implement those portions of this subsection of the StaffordAct which are inconsistent with the mandates of the Single Audit Act.5. Assistance by Federal agencies has been amended to reflect minor changesauthorized by the Stafford Act. In addition, for clarity, procedures forrequesting assistance from other Federal agencies, and the reimbursementtherefor, has been included. The information was previously shown in 44CFR Part 205 as Subpart I.For further information on provisions generally applicable to disasterassistance programs, contact Deborah Hart at 202-646-3612.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Declaration Process (Subpart B)</ITAG>This subpart outlines the process by which a major disaster or emergencymay be declared, including additional actions which may result after adeclaration.1. The Stafford Act establishes statutory provisions for cost sharing byState and local governments. The procedures for the Governor's requesthave been amended to include a commitment that the State and local governmentswill assume the non-Federal share of costs required under the Act. TheGovernor's certification of compliance with cost-sharing requirements willsatisfy the need for a State and local commitment, including the requirementthat the State's commitment must be significant proportion of the combinedState and local contribution. When no cost-shared programs are implemented,other State/local commitments may be required.2. It is FEMA's responsibility to gather information pertaining to assistancerequested by a Governor, and provide a recommendation to the President.The ultimate decision whether to activate the Act's authorities is thePresident's. In response to a Governor's request for a major disaster declaration,the President may declare either a major disaster or an emergency, or denythe Governor's request. The Governor's request for an emergency, however,may result only in a declaration of an emergency or denial of the request.3. Assistance provided under a major disaster declaration may include acomplete range of emergency and permanent assistance or may be limitedto certain types of assistance. Assistance provided under an emergencydeclaration is limited only to emergency assistance necessary to save livesand protect property, public health and safety, or to lessen or avert thethreat of a catastrophe. The idea of restricting the recovery provisions and programs to cover primarilynatural catastrophes under a major disaster is not new. Legislation wasfirst introduced in 1982 to change the definitions of ``major disaster''and ``emergency'' to establish separate statutory authorities for dealingwith two distinct types of situations: (1) programs of response and recoveryfollowing ``major disasters'', primarily of ``natural'' origin, and (2)``emergency'' programs of short-term, immediate response to provide neededlife-saving, public health, safety and property-protecting measures ina broad range of incidents. In S. Rpt. No. 97-459 dated May 28, 1982, accompanying S. 2250, 97th Cong.2d Sess., the Committee on Environment and Public Works stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The authorities of title V permit the Government to provide neededlife-saving, public health, safety and property-protecting measures ina broad range of incidents. The Administration could then, in a more deliberatemanner, determine whether to provide continuing assistance and, if so,identify the proper authorities under which to provide it. For unusualtypes of civil emergencies for which adequate response authorities do notexist, the Administration, and the Congress, as a result of enactment ofthe new title V, would have more time to design and enact legislation specificallytailored to the problem instead of relying upon the Disaster Relief Actof 1974 which was written to respond to a specific class of natural catastrophesfor which the Act was tailored.</ITAG>Although virtually identical legislation was proposed in several billsduring the 1980's, the provisions did not become law until passage of theDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-707.Nevertheless, the legislative history leading to the enactment of Pub.L. 100-707 indicates a clear Congressional intent to authorize a much morelimited range of Federal assistance in response to ``emergencies'' thanin response to ``major disasters''. 4. Under previous disaster legislation, Federal assistance could not beprovided until a declaration was made by the President. A new authorityunder the Stafford Act permits emergency assistance to be provided by Departmentof Defense for 10 days during the immediate aftermath of an incident whichmay ultimately qualify for a major disaster or emergency declaration. Theassistance must be requested by the Governor to the FEMA Associate Director.If justified, FEMA will direct the DOD through mission assignment to providepersonnel and equipment to accomplish the task. The 75 percent Federalshare of the cost of such assistance will be paid from funds appropriatedfor disaster relief under the Stafford Act. The remaining 25 percent willbe paid by the State and local governments. This assistance will not supplantassistance provided by DOD or other Federal agencies under separate authorities.5. Under section 501(b) of the Stafford Act, the President may declarean emergency, without a request from the Governor, if the emergency situationis one for which the primary responsibility rests with the Federal government.FEMA will coordinate with the Governor if practicable. This authority isnot intended to be used to preempt the authorities of other Federal agenciesor to fund other programs in place independent of the Stafford Act. Section 503(a) of the Act includes a cost-sharing provision. The minimumFederal share is 75 percent. In a modified emergency declaration wherethe situation is a unique Federal responsibility, the Federal share maybe more than 75 percent. It is anticipated that such a declaration wouldbe extremely rare. Such a declaration would be a deviation from normalexperience and would have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. 6. Under certain limited conditions, FEMA may lend or advance a granteethe non-Federal share of assistance. FEMA interprets the ``lending'' and``advancing'' authorities at section 319 of the Stafford Act to be identical.Therefore, FEMA considers all advances of the non-Federal share of disasterassistance to be tantamount to loans. The terms and conditions for loansand loan repayment are given in paragraph 206.45. There is no forgivenessfeature authorized under the Act; therefore, all such loans must be repaid.In compliance with the Common Rule as referenced in 44 CFR Part 13, FEMAconsiders the ``grantee'' to be the State. Therefore, all loans will beto the State as the grantee. It will be the responsibility of the Stateto distribute and administer loans to subgrantees. FEMA will evaluate each loan request on its own merits, considering, asan example, disaster related expenditures incurred by the grantee overthe preceding 12 months, or the impact of a catastrophic event on the budgetsof State and local governments and how it affects their ability to providecontinuing services to their constituents. 7. Section 320 of the Act stipulates that an arithmetic formula or slidingscale may not be used as the sole basis for denying assistance. FEMA hasincludes a list of factors in andSection; 206.37 which will be used to evaluateall requests for a declaration of major disaster or emergency. Therefore,no arithmetic formula or sliding scale will be used as the sole basis fordenying disaster assistance. 8. Regulations published in 44 CFR Part 205 outlined specific languagethat would be used in FEMA-State Agreements. We have modified the paragraphon FEMA-State Agreements to outline the process, rather than to identifyany mandatory language for such agreements. In a modified declaration fora Federal emergency, a FEMA-State Agreement may not be required where thereis little or no State and local involvement in the assistance provided.For futher information on the declaration process, contact Deborah Hartat 202-646-3612. <ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Assistance (Subpart C)</ITAG>Title V of the Stafford Act redefines the circumstance for which an emergencymay be declared and the assistance which may be provided under an emergencydeclaration. The declaration process for emergencies is included in SubpartB. Subpart C contains a description of the assistance available after anemergency declaration and of when that assistance may be authorized. 1. Assistance under an emergency declaration is limited to essential workto save and protect lives, property, health, and safety, or to lessen oravert the threat of a catastrophe. No long term or permanent restorativeassistance is authorized. Title V of the Act specifically identifies thekind of assistance that may be provided under an emergency declaration.The only specific Stafford Act major disaster authorities (i.e., authorizedby Title IV of the Act) that Congress also made available in Title V aredebris removal under Section 407 of the Act, and temporary housing assistanceunder Section 408 of the Act.2. Title V of the Act indicates a clear Congressional intent that the resourcesand authorities of other Federal agencies will be utilized first. Onlyif such authorities and resources are inadequate to meet immediate emergencyneeds will FEMA implement emergency assistance programs under the Act.Prior to enactment of Pub. L. 100-707, discussions in both the Senate andthe House of Representatives indicate the clear intent that Stafford Actemergency declarations should not be used to override other Federal responsemechanisms already in place. For example, Congressman Stangeland, one ofthe sponsors of H.R. 2707, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., and a member of the HouseCommittee for Public Works and Transportation, remarked on p. H943, Cong.Rec., March 17, 1988:<ITAG tagnum="21">The committee, however, does not intend for emergency declarationsto be available in responding to public health problems such as AIDS epidemicsor environmental or nuclear catastrophes for which Federal assistance isalready available. Nor do we intend to interfere with existing Federalemergency authorities or the Comprehensive Crime Control Act's law enforcementemergency assistance provisions.</ITAG>Likewise, a page 4 in S. Rpt. No. 100-524 (September 7, 1988), which accompaniedS. 2380, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., the Committee on Environment and PublicWorks of the United States Senate stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">In any emergency the President must first invoke other Federal authoritiesavailable to him to meet the crisis. If there are other authorities, therole of the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be limited to providingtechnical assistance and coordinating the efforts of other Federal agenciesunder authorities granted to them under other Federal acts. Only aftera determination that assistance under other Federal authorities is inadequateto meet the crisis may FEMA directly intervene. Up to $5 million in Federalassistance may be provided to FEMA for each emergency before the Presidentis required to ask the Congress for additional authority or funds. Underthe bill, emergency assistance differs from the emergency program availableunder current law.</ITAG>This comment is consistent with remarks made by the Senate Committee onEnvironment and Public Works in S. Rpt. No. 98-448 (May 14, 1984), whichaccompanied S. 2517, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.In the event of a declaration, all agencies providing assistance will operateunder the coordination of the Federal Coordinating Officer.3. There is a funding cap of $5,000,000 per declaration. If it becomesnecessary to exceed this limitation for any one incident, a report mustbe made to Congress and, if necessary, additional legislation would beproposed.For further information on emergency assistance, contact Deborah Hart at202-646-3612.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>An environmental assessment has been prepared, leading to the determinationthat this rule will not have a significant impact on the environment andthat an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. The assessmentis available for review at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Officeof General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street,SW., Washington, DC 20472.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility</ITAG>FEMA has determined that this rule is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291, and will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Hence, no regulatory impact analyses have been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>In promulgating these rules, FEMA has considered the President's ExecutiveOrder on Federalism issued on October 26, 1978 (E.O. 12612, 52 FR 41685).The purpose of the order is to assure the appropriate division of governmentalresponsibilities between national government and the States. Among otherprovisions, this rule implements the requirement that agency rules be inaccordance with the so-called common rule, adopted by FEMA at 44 CFR Part13, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreementsto State and Local Governments. These regulations conform FEMA assistanceto the executive order; to describe this, a Federalism assessment has beenprepared. It may be obtained or reviewed at the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington,DC 20472.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting Requirements</ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information collectionrequirements contained in Subparts B and C of this rule under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et. seq.</T3>, and has assigned OMB Control Number 3067-0113.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 206</ITAG>Disaster assistance: General, The declaration process, Emergency assistance,Individual assistance, Public assistance, The Coastal Barrier ResourcesAct, Community disaster loans, Fire suppression, Hazard mitigation.Accordingly, FEMA is making the following changes to Chapter I, SubchapterD, of Title 44, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 206_FEDERAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE DECLARED ON OR AFTER NOVEMBER23, 1988</ITAG>1.

It is in the best interest of allparties to combine State and Federal personnel resources by performinga joint PDA prior to the initiation of a Governor's request, as follows.(a) <T3>Preassessment by the State</T3>. When an incident occurs, or is imminent,which the State official responsible for disaster operations determinesmay be beyond the State and local government capabilities to respond, theState will request the Regional Director to perform a joint FEMA-Statepreliminary damage assessment. It is not anticipated that all occurrenceswill result in the requirement for assistance; therefore, the State willbe expected to verify their initial information, in some manner, beforerequesting this support.(b) <T3>Damage assessment teams</T3>. Damage assessment teams will be composedof at least one representative of the Federal Government and one representativeof the State.
