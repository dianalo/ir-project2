The decision by U.S. District Judge Tom Stagg came after the jury deliberated for 19 hours before announcing it couldn't reach a verdict.    Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lydick said the government would consider asking for a new trial. Mr. Lydick replaced lead prosecutor Joe Cage, who withdrew from the case just before closing arguments Friday. Mr. Cage left after Judge Stagg disallowed including in closing arguments a document Mr. Cage believed to be crucial to his case.    Mr. Beebe, his family or his Shreveport, La.-based company have owned parts of 50 banks in the Southwest, including several that have failed. Over the years, Mr. Beebe or his company, AMI Inc., Shreveport, have helped finance real estate developers who purchased control of certain Texas savings and loans, some of which later failed.    Last March, a federal grand jury in Shreveport named Mr. Beebe in a 19-count indictment charging him with conspiring to defraud 16 banks and Sandamp;Ls in four states in transactions involving some $30 million. His case was moved to Lafayette to escape pretrial publicity.    In court, the government argued that the $30 million came mostly from banks and thrifts where Mr. Beebe had substantial influence, and in some cases, an ownership stake. Prosecutors told the jury that the money was used to help a major horse breeder in Dallas to pay off some debts so that he and Mr. Beebe could eventually go into business together selling racehorse tax shelters.    Mr. Beebe, through his lawyer, Gerry Spence of Jackson Hole, Wyo., has denied any wrongdoing, and has accused the government of harassment. Mr. Beebe was convicted in 1985 of loan fraud and is on probation. In response to the judge's decision, Mr. Spence said the prosecution failed in &quot;an attempt to turn ordinary honest business transactions into something ugly and evil.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
