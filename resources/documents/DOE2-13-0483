We have developed a simple techniqueto analyze data from Chromium-51 release assays using the widely availableLOTUS 1-2-3 spreadsheet software. This package calculates percentagespecific cytotoxicity and lytic units by linear regression. It uses alldata points to compute the linear regression and can determine if thereis a statistically significant difference between two lysis curves. Thesystem is simple to use and easily modified, since its implementationrequires neither knowledge of computer programming nor custom designedsoftware. This package can help save considerable time when analyzingdata from Chromium-51 release assays.</TEXT></DOC>
