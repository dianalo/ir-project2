 The systems themselves areunexciting.andP;  The new Model 80s run at 20 and 25 MHz; IBM still has no 33-MHzsystems, and their only 486 system is the Model 70 with a 486 retrofit.andM;The announcement was nonetheless quite significant in that the new systemsare the first PCs from IBM to use the SCSI interface for the hard disk.andP;  IBMhas shown SCSI adapters for their Micro Channel machines as &quot;technologydemonstrations&quot; for the past three Comdex shows, but until now, no SCSIproducts for the PC line have been available from IBM.andP;  Some PC-compatiblesystem vendors and third-party disk controller suppliers have had SCSIproducts for the AT bus and the Micro Channel, but these products have notbeen widely used.andM;The SCSI adapters used in the new systems are also available separately, andcan be use in any Micro Channel system.andP;  Two models are available: a 16-bitadapter, and a 32-bit adapter with 512 Kbytes of cache RAM.andP;  Both are busmasters, and both are claimed to be capable of performing SCSI transfers at 5Mbytes/s.andP;  The 16-bit adapter can perform transfers on the Micro Channel at8.3 Mbytes/s, and is priced at $499.andP;  The 32-bit adapter has twice thetransfer rate on the Micro Channel, and is priced at $995.andP;  Both products usean Adaptec SCSI controller and two IBM ASICs; the 32-bit caching controlleralso includes an 80186 microprocessor.andM;Both adapters include an on-board BIOS ROM that allows both SCSI and non-SCSIdrives to be used in the same machine, and support both DOS and OS/2.andP;  Up toseven SCSI devices can be attached to each adapter, and up to four adapterscan be installed in a single system.andP;  The adapters implement the SCSI-1standard, and conform to the &quot;Common Command Set.&quot;andM;In addition to the SCSI adapters, IBM introduced three SCSI hard disk drivesand a SCSI CD-ROM drive in both internal and external versions.andP;  The 60- and120-Mbyte drives have an average access time of 23 ms, while the 320-Mbytedrive has an impressive 12.5 ms average access time; prices are $1,200,$1,920, and $5,500.andP;  The CD-ROM drive is $1,250 for the internal version and$1,550 for the external model.andM;IBM is calling SCSI a &quot;strategic interface&quot; for the company, and while IBM isalways cautious about commenting on future product plans, it seems clear thatmost future systems will include SCSI support.andP;  IBM's official support ofSCSI is also likely to boost the interest of clone-makers and system buyersin SCSI.andP;  Eventually, the SCSI interface will move onto the system board, andwill connect directly to the high-speed processor bus, rather than the I/Obus.andM;IBM-compatible PCs have traditionally used the ST-506-type disk interface,with ESDI drives for high-end machines.andP;  Originally, the disk controller wason a separate add-in card, as shown in Figure 1.andP;  More recently, many systemvendors have moved to drives (such as those from Western Digital and ConnerPeripherals) that include the disk controller as part of the driveelectronics, as shown in Figure 2.andP;  The so-called &quot;IDE&quot; (Integrated DriveElectronics) disk drives connect directly to the AT bus, generally through a40-pin header on the system board reserved for that purpose.andP;  (IBM's PS/2line uses a similar interface, but with a 44-pin connector.)andM;IDE drives achieve one of the goals of SCSI -- moving the disk controller outof the computer and onto the disk drive.andP;  This allows the disk drivemanufacturer to tune the controller to the disk drive, and eliminates theneed to conform to a standard interface between the controller and the driveelectronics.andP;  The interface standard also constrains the disk design, bylimiting the number of heads that can be supported, the data transfer rate,and other factors.andM;Figure 3 shows a system with a SCSI disk interface.andP;  The interface in thecomputer is called a SCSI &quot;host adapter,&quot; and may be an add-in card (as inIBM's new offerings) or on the system board (as in Apple's Macintosh).andP;  ASCSI host adapter can be as simple as a single, low-cost chip, such as theNCR 5380 used in the Macintosh.andP;  Only in Apple's most recent Macintosh, theIIfx, have they provided DMA for the SCSI port.andP;  IBM's SCSI adapters are atthe other extreme, providing dedicated processors and direct DMA into systemmemory.andM;The disk drive assembly includes a disk controller with a SCSI interface.andP;  ASCSI disk drive must include a microprocessor to control the disk and theinterface, and often includes some buffer memory as well.andP;  The SCSI cable canbe &quot;daisy-chained&quot; to connect up to seven logical devices (devicecontrollers), and each device controller can control multiple physicaldevices.andM;The embedded interface approach is inherently simpler than the SCSI approach,and is likely to continue to dominate in low-end systems.andP;  For mid-range andhigh-end systems, however, the increased cost of SCSI is well justified.andO;Most importantly, SCSI is a universal interface.andP;  In addition to supportingup to seven devices on a single interface, those seven devices can be a mixof hard disks, CD ROM drives, tape drives, scanners, and other peripherals.andO;SCSI disk drives and other peripherals are independent of the bus structureand microprocessor of the host computer, so the same peripherals can be usedwith AT, EISA, and Micro Channel systems--and, of course, with Apple'sMacintosh.andM;SCSI drives today typically don't perform quite as well as ESDI drives.andP;  Thiswill change, however, as drive manufacturers and host adapter designers learnhow to tune the interface for maximum performance.andP;  The widespread use ofSCSI on workstations is sure to keep pushing SCSI devices to ever-higherperformance levels.andM;Vendors of Macintosh SCSI peripherals should find their potential marketgreatly expanded.andP;  In theory, SCSI devices should be generic, and usable onany system with a SCSI interface.andP;  All that should be required is theappropriate driver software on the host computer.andP;  Unfortunately, Apple'simplementation of SCSI doesn't fully conform to the standard, and vendors ofSCSI peripherals have needed to modify their firmware to work with the Mac.andO;For systems that do conform to the SCSI specification, however, thesemodifications are undesirable.andM;As a result, many vendors of SCSI disk drives chip two versions of theirproducts: one for the Mac, and one for everything else.andP;  Now that non-Macapplications are becoming more common, vendors are incorporating hardwarejumpers or software commands to allow the drives to be switched between&quot;normal&quot; mode and &quot;Macintosh&quot; mode.andM;ConclusionsandM;SCSI, already widely used in workstations as well as Macintosh systems, willbecome increasingly dominant as the preferred disk interface forIBM-compatible PCs.andP;  One exception will be in low-end systems, where the IDEdrives will continue to be preferred for their low cost.andP;  SCSI will graduallybecome the standard for other peripherals as well, leading eventually to theend of the &quot;Centronics&quot; parallel interface.andM;Vendors of SCSI disk drives and other peripherals will benefit from theincreased volume of the IBM-compatible business, and Macintosh users willbenefit from the price reductions that will result from this economy ofscale.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
