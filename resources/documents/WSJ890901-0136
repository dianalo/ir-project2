The bank warns that rapid deforestation poses several threats to the Indonesian economy and environment. It could cut the supply of wood available for export, cause serious land degradation and threaten a precious ecological diversity that makes Indonesia home to thousands of species of plants, the report says.    Large-scale forest clearing as carried out in Indonesia, the report says, produces smoke and carbon dioxide that contribute to global warming. Most studies place Indonesia second only to Brazil in producing atmospheric pollution from this source, it adds.    Timber companies with concessions in Indonesia often use harmful logging practices and are only concerned with short-term gains, the bank says. The concession-holders are inadequately regulated and have been paying far less to state coffers than they should, the report says.    The bank's assessments, which supports some steps Indonesian authorities have taken to protect the environment, are contained in a confidential report completed in June. The report weighs how the country's forest, land and water resources can be used and sustained to aid in development.    Internationally, the preservation of tropical forests has increasingly been getting attention, and the bank says that forest conservation is particularly important in Indonesia.    The country has large forests -- accounting for about 60% of all forested area in Southeast Asia -- that the bank describes as having &quot;enormous commercial and ecological value.&quot;    In his Independence Day speech last month, President Suharto called on developed countries to work with Indonesia to help it plant 20 million hectares (49 million acres) of new forests. He said Indonesia's planting budget was limited and that rich countries had an obligation to help since they had benefited from importing the country's timber.    The World Bank report doesn't discuss this proposal for foreign planting help, though it discusses external assistance in forestry work that it says could be a model with environmental improvements.    The bank report says that in the early 1970s, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated the rate of deforestation in Indonesia at 300,000 hectares a year. In 1981, the FAO raised this estimate to 600,000 hectares and &quot;recently&quot; it suggested the rate could be one million hectares annually. The World Bank says the data are weak, but that this estimate is possible.    The bank estimates that 15% to 20% of forest depletion is caused by poor logging practices, another 25% is from development projects, and the remainder results from land being converted to agricultural use.    The bank makes a calculation of the loss to Indonesia from deforestation, much of it coming from land that must be left fallow for a long time after being used for shifting cultivation.    The overall cost of deforestation and timber depletion is &quot;conservatively estimated at about $1 billion a year,&quot; the report says. </TEXT></DOC>
