Anisotropic hydrogen defect centres with properties analogousto Mu* have been detected in Si, Ge, GaAs, GaP and diamond. The molecularradical model relies heavily on tetrahedral hybrid orbitals being a goodbasis for the description of bonding. It also explains why Mu* centresare not seen in the more ionic binary compounds, where charge-densityfalls to zero between the ions. 20 refs.; 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
