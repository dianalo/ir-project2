Sandamp;L lobbyists are urging Congress to combine the separateinsurance funds for commercial banks and savings institutions.President Bush, under his plan to revitalize the industry, wouldmaintain separate funds administered by one agency.   ``I believe one drowning man is enough,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,D-Texas, told reporters.   Industry representatives also received little sympathy Tuesdayfrom either Senate Banking Committee members or from representativesof banking groups.   Bush would increase the deposit insurance premiums paid bysavings and loans and force their owners to invest more of their ownmoney, or capital, within two years.   Barney R. Beeksma, president of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, the largest Sandamp;L trade group, told the Senate committeethat the Bush plan, by burdening healthy Sandamp;Ls, means ``less mortgagemoney will be available and housing will be denied to millions ofhouseholds.''   ``We seek to make our contribution at a level that will not be soburdensome as to weaken our institutions and thus exacerbate furtherthe current ... crisis,'' Beeksma said.   ``The lynch-mob mentality is rampant today, unjustly threateningthe innocent majority (of Sandamp;Ls) along with the handful ofscoundrels,'' he said.   Both Beeksma and Bud Koch, president of the National Council ofSavings Institutions, asked senators to phase in the strictercapital standards over five years, instead of two, arguing that mostinstitutions could meet the standard over time.   ``The current timetable ... is totally unrealistic,'' Koch said.   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American BankersAssociation, called the league's proposal to make commercial bankspay for Sandamp;L problems ``a deadly prescription for a dangerousdisease.''   ``They seem crazy with desperation,'' she said. ``Their backs areagainst the wall and they're not thinking straight.''   The bankers group supports the Bush plan.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said Sandamp;L groups, by asking for more timeon the capital standards, ``invite us ... by ignoring the lessons ofhistory, to relive it.'' Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., characterized theindustry's position as ``let's have business as usual.''   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., saying the league had in the pasttried to play down Sandamp;Ls' poor condition, told the lobbyists, ``Youhave no credibility here today.''   ``I'm sure you all have lots of friends here, but less than youused to,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.   However, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said he would press forprovisions to ease capital requirements for smaller savings andloans, such as those in his state.   Bush last month proposed spending about $150 billion over 10years _ half of it from taxpayers _ to close or sell insolvent Sandamp;Ls.He also would restructure the regulatory system by giving theTreasury Department control over the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.Critics have charged the industry with exerting too much influenceover the Sandamp;L agency.   The league, but not the national council, opposes Bush's effortto exert greater administration control over Sandamp;L regulators.   Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the committee,said industry influence on regulators could be reduced withoutturning over control to what he called ``the gnomes of Treasury.''</TEXT></DOC>
