While the Federal German Government considers nuclearenergy indispensable also in the long term, the opposition wants to optout of nuclear energy. To put the political controversy on a more soberfooting, several scientific expertises have already been drawn up onthe consequences of a nculear phase-out. The Minister for Trade and Transportof the State of Bavaria commissioned the 'Ifo-Institut' to investigatethe energy and national-economic, as well as the ecological consequencesof dispensing at once or gradually with power from nuclear power plantsin the Federal Republic of Germany, with special regard to Bavaria.
