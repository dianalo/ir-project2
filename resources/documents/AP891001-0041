Michel Aoun demanded a timetable for their pullout beforeagreeing to peace.   In Beirut, where Aoun made his comments, Christian forces andSyrian-backed Druse militiamen battled for 15 minutes around themountain garrison of Souk al-Gharb, testing a fragile cease-fire.No casualties were reported.   Reporters are barred from the parliament sessions in Taif, aSaudi Arabian resort, and from direct access to the lawmakers.   But sources at the meeting reported a stormy session Sunday asthe 63 members of parliament _ 33 Christians and 30 Moslems _gathered for a second day in their bid to end the 14-year-old civilwar and address an Arab League peace plan.   The session was dominated by disagreements between Christiansand Moslems over what Syria's role in Lebanon should be, said thesources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Saudi host Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal played downthe discord.   ``We do not regard this as disturbing in any way. In fact, it isa healthy sign that all views are aired and opinions expressed,''he said.   He praised former Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salaam forinvoking the slogan ``failure is not permissible.''   Supporters of Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, say they will not agreeto give Moslems a greater share of political power until there is atimetable for a pullout of the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops inLebanon.   Syrian troops first entered Lebanon in 1976 as part of an ArabLeague peacekeeping force. They initially sought to curb Moslemfactions, but wound up fighting the Christians and Aoun says theyhave lost their mandate.   Syrian-backed Moslem leaders support a continuing role for Syriato protect their position and help guarantee a settlement ofLebanon's civil war.   Moslem lawmakers argued that Syria should stay in Lebanon untilIsrael withdraws from a southern Lebanese border strip it hasoccupied since 1982. Israel says the strip, six to 10 miles wide,is a security zone.   Iraq has been supplying weapons to the Christians, partly to geteven with Syria for backing Iran, Iraq's enemy, in the eight-yearPersian Gulf war.   Damascus has said it will not consider a withdrawal until itsMoslem allies are given an equal share of power with theChristians, who have dominated the executive, army and judiciarysince Lebanon gained independence in 1943.   Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the poulation,although there has been no official census since 1932.   Addressing supporters in Beirut on Sunday, Aoun said: ``We shallaccept nothing now that we have rejected in the past because ourdemands are indivisible. ... We have waged war to achieve peace.''   ``Our only essential goal is to liberate our land andre-establish sovereignty over Lebanon's entire territory. We shallnot compromise the blood of our martyrs,'' Auon said.   His remarks appeared to be a response to pressures on Christianlawmakers in Taif to agree to postpone discussion of Syria's roleuntil after the election of a new president, formation of a newgovernment and agreement on political reforms.   Under that scenario, the Syrians then would begin to withdrawfrom Moslem west Beirut and regroup in eastern Lebanon's BekaaValley. The withdrawal from the greater Beirut area would becompleted in two years, according to officials in Beirut.   Lebanon has been without a head of state since former PresidentAmin Gemayel's six-year term ended on Sept. 22, 1988.   Gemayel named Aoun a caretaker prime minister before he leftoffice, but Moslems rejected the appointment and said acting PrimeMinister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, is the legitimate head ofgovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
