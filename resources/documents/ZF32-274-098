 This Comdex was no exception.andP;  Although a wide range of LAN gearand software vendors exhibited at Comdex, many of which made major productannouncements, we (as well as the industry) focused primarily on the ongoingwar between Microsoft's LAN Manager and Novell's NetWare for the hearts andminds of the industry's workgroups.andP;  Each made or introduced a number of newfeatures that promised to &quot;one-up&quot; the other.andM;Microsoft's new partner.andP;  Microsoft and its OEM/development partner for LANManager, 3Com, have been engaged in an ongoing &quot;features war&quot; with Novellever since the release of LAN Manager 1.0 early last year.andP;  LAN Manager (inits initial incarnation as 3Com's 3 + Open) caught the attention of theindustry when performance shootouts indicated that it was faster than NetWare286 in a number of categories (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  12, page 7).andP;  Moreover, LANManager had succeeded from day one in putting Novell on the defensiveconcerning the latter's plans for OS/2 named pipes support, necessary toaccess SQL Server-based applications (which run only on OS/2 LAN Managernetworks).andM;Earlier this year, Novell counterattacked with the introduction of NetWare386, which was shown to outperform LAN Manager 1.1 almost across the board,especially in heavily loaded networks.andP;  Not shy, Novell emphasized this factby running a 250-PC network in its room at the Las Vegas Convention Center.andM;Just before Comdex, Microsoft responded with a new release of LAN Manager anda new development partner, Compaq.andP;  LAN Manager 2.0, billed as a&quot;from-the-ground-up&quot; redesign of LAN Manager, was developed in cooperationwith Compaq, which provided the multiple processor support (see the HardwareTrends section later in our coverage), as well as with Cogent Technologies(which provided the fault-tolerant disk drives), Olivetti (utilities for thenew 32-bit High Performance File System), Nokia Data (remote-bootcapabilities for diskless workstations), Parallan Computer (which wrote hooksto the OS/2 kernel for multiprocessing and supplies a coprocessor boardoptimized for LAN Manager 2.0), and 3Com (which co-created the Network DriverInterface specification).andM;LAN Manager 2.0andM;The result is a revamped and much-improved network operating system thatshould be a fair match for NetWare 386 nearly across the board.andP;  Among thenew features are:andM;* '386/'486 processor support.andP;  On '386 or '486 machines, LAN Manager 2.0automatically installs a '386-optimized network I/O subsystem and a'386-specific version of the High Performance File System introduced withOS/i 1.2 (HPFS-386).andP;  Billed as a harbinger of the good things coming soon toOS/2 in its 32-bit version, HPFS-386 is an installable file system that willeventually allow users to address up to 48 terabytes of disk space in 24two-terabyte volumes.andP;  (The initial release will only support 48 GB in 24two-gigabyte volumes due to limitations in 16-bit OS/2 1.2, on which itcurrently runs.)andP;  It also allows Macintosh-style long file names, andincludes extensive information, such as individual access permissions, in theattributes for each file.andM;* Multiprocessor support.andP;  Version 2.0 (when running on '386 machines)supports multiprocessor servers such as Compaq's Systempro.andP;  This supportlets server-based applications run on a separate CPU from the underlyingnetwork operating system.andP;  It will be a boon to compute-intensiveserver-based applications such as SQL server.andM;* Enhanced administrative tools.andP;  One of NetWare's strong points has been itsextensive set of administrative tools.andP;  LAN Manager 2.0 has added a number offeatures designed to beef up its administrative capabilities.andP;  Administratorscan oversee a group of servers as though they were a single server bygrouping them into a single unit, or domain.andP;  Domain service allows useraccounts across all servers in a domain to be updated at one time, ratherthan individually on a server-by-server basis.andP;  IBM had previouslyimplemented a similar &quot;single system image&quot; service, and 3Com had includeddomain service in its 3+ and 3+Open network operating systems as part of itsproprietary system enhancements, but now domain service will be available toall LAN Manager OEMs.andM;Other administrative enhancements include the ability to delegate commonadministrative privileges to individuals for management of the server, useraccounts, and printers or modems.andP;  A remote boot feature supports both OS/2and DOS workstations and is similar to 3Com's 3+Start service or Novell's ROMboot capabiity.andM;* Security at both server and workstation.andP;  LAN Manager 1.0 was considered tobe seriously deficient in security protection, particularly in a PC server.andO;Network security under LAN Manager 2.0 has been strengthened at both theworkstation and the server levels to prevent unauthorized access.andP;  Specificmeasures include password aging, time- and workstation-specific restrictions,and a password validation delay (which is effective at blocking randompassword generation programs).andP;  On '386- or '486-based servers, security isstrengthened even further by the HPFS, which prevents users withoutadministrative privileges from logging onto the file system whether theserver is booted from a floppy or the hard disk.andM;* Built-in fault tolerance.andP;  In response to the threat from NetWare'sfault-tolerant capabilities, Microsoft has added support for fault-tolerantdisk subsystems and uninterruptible power supplies.andP;  LAN Manager 2.0 alsosupports a &quot;hot fix&quot; capability, which (like its Novell counterpart)automatically transfers data from bad disk sectors to good ones on the flyand subsequently marks the bad ones so that they can't be accessed again.andM;* Reduced DOS memory requirements.andP;  Microsoft has added a new version of itsNetbeui transport layer, called Jetbeui, which, when used in conjunction withEMS 4.0 memory, reduces LAN driver memory requirements to 59 KB forfile-sharing and client-server applications, leaving 500K+ of RAM availablefor applications.andM;* Peer services.andP;  Any OS/2 LAN Manager 1.2 workstation can be a peer-to-peerserver for any other single workstation on the network and can supportserver-based applications such as SQL Server and Saros FileShare.andP;  (Saros,incidentally, announced support for Windows' DDE at Comdex.)andP;  This capabilityprovides a low-cost alternative to requiring multiple full-capability fileservers on the network.andP;  We aren't too impressed with the one-userrestriction, which Microsoft indicated is a marketing, not a technical,issue.andM;The Compaq connection.andP;  Many people were surprised when Microsoft announcedthat Compaq was its partner in the LAN Manager 2.0 announcement.andP;  Mostindustry analysts focused on the impact of the announcement on 3Com and otherLAN Manager OEMs that have traditionally sold proprietary network servers.andO;But as we indicated in our coverage of Compaq's Systempro in the HardwareTrends section of this Report, Compaq's real target is IBM--which, of course,has its own LAN Server offering.andM;Compaq's partnership with Microsoft in the development of LAN Manager 2.0underscores the important role that LAN and workgroup tools will play in thecomputing landscape of the '90s.andP;  Compaq is signifying to the industry--thescores of third- and fourth-tier companies that take their lead from Compaqand not (any longer) from IBM--that, like IBM, it considers network servicesa system-level offering, necessary to be competitive in thefuture.andP;  No longeris it sufficient just to point customers in the direction of third-party LANofferings.andP;  Digital Equipment, Sun Microsystems and IBM send signals thisway; now Compaq is doing it.andP;  So the message is loud and clear: if you aregoing to be a real computer company in the '90s, you are going to have tooffer system-level LAN support too.andP;  By throwing its hat in LAN Manager'sring (even though it paid lip service to running NetWare 386 and Banyan'sVines 386 on the Systempro as well), Compaq gave a big boost to LAN Manager'sfortunes.andP;  In view of Novell's continuing dominance of the network industry,this is a boost LAN Manager really needs.andM;Novell 386 and NLMsandM;It it too much to believe that Novell could possibly be heeding the callissued at the last Seybold Conference for major vendors to encourage othervendors to develop kindred products?andP;  Novell rounded up representatives from12 software vendors to speak at Comdex about their experience working withNovell's new Programmer's Workbench.andP;  The program, now being shipped, allowsother vendors to develop add-on products, called NLMs (NetWare LoadableModules), for NetWare 386.andP;  We think this is an acronym you will be hearing alot about in the coming year.andM;Not suprisingly, each of the vendors (shall we now dub them &quot;subvendors&quot;?)andO;spoke in glowing terms about how wonderful it is to work with Programmer'sWorkbench.andP;  It is fast and easy to use, they said, and Novell has beenwonderful about supporting them in their efforts.andP;  Well, talk is one thingand results another, but the vendors did have some results to talk about.andO;Vortex Systems had a demo of its NLM, which performs continuous tape backup,running in the Novell booth.andP;  Not bad when you're working with beta software.andM;These vendors represented a broad spectrum of application areas, includingelectronic mail, accounting, database and backup systems.andP;  Dr. S. Bing Yao,president of XDB Systems, shared his company's enthusiasm for the newproduct.andP;  He is interested in supporting NetWare 386 users who are also dBase2 users.andP;  Another speaker, Stan Levine of Automated Design Systems, talkedabout creating a Windows-compatible print utility for almost unlimited accessto remote output devices.andM;What are NLMs?andP;  Although similar to the VAPs (Value Added Processes) familiarto NetWare 286 users, NLMs are different in some important ways.andP;  They arepermitted to change-certain parts of the NetWare operating system, such asfile system and protocol stacks.andP;  They can be loaded and unloaded as needed.andO;They can allocate and release memory, start and stop execution threads, andaccess NetWare and other NLMs as required.andM;Having this off-again/on-again quality means flexible usage of preciousserver resources, but it makes the pessimist in us wonder what would happenif all the NLMs were called at once.andP;  What do Novell and NLM writers plan todo to prevent conflicts and problems?andP;  What can they do?andP;  Novell has notclearly stated anything on this topic, except that it will work with NLMcreators to certify their products and to work out ways to prevent problemssuch as system overload.andM;Lilliputian mainframes.andP;  All this talk about on-call client/serverapplications for NetWare reminds us of the possibility of mainframecapabilities in PC-sized boxes.andP;  Will it be unnecessary to purchase '286 and'386 machines and the like for use as workstations?andP;  Perhaps all we willreally need is a diskless workstation (better known in the mainframe world asa &quot;terminal&quot;).andP;  Whatever happened to the &quot;personal&quot; computer?andM;Certainly, NetWare NLMs (and their counterparts in LAN Managerimplementations) give users more options.andP;  Such centralized computingservices could save you money if your company has a large installed base ofolder equipment, say PCs and XTs, or if you don't want to buy more processingpower than you absolutely need.andM;However, for most publishing applications, we expect that network operatingsystems will continue to be used simply to manage shared files.andP;  For decentperformance, workstations will need local hard disks, lots of memory and thefastest processors you can afford.andM;Developer's kit.andP;  Novell also announced the availability of the NetWare OS/2Developer's Kit.andP;  The price is $495, which includes support, updates and thefinal version of the NetWare programming interfaces for OS/2.andM;Et tu?andM;And what of some of the other principals in this ongoing saga?andP;  3Com, for itspart, will likely be forced to &quot;do a Sun&quot; in the future by licensing itsproprietary extensions--highly desirable ones such as 3+Mail, Macintoshservice, and multiple protocol support--to Compaq and other LAN Manager OEMs.andO;In the end, companies like Banyan and 3Com may be driven out of the networkserver business as the major system vendors focus increasingly on offeringthat functionality themselves with their greater economies of scale.andP;  Today'snetwork vendors will survive by concentrating on network extensions,integration, installation, service and support.andP;  As one large user commented,&quot;Who would you trust to install your LAN, a 3Com dealer with umpteen yearsexperience with workgroups or a Compaq cowboy fresh from learning what a LANis?&quot;andM;The way that things are going, users will have two clear choices of LANarchitectures: LAN Manager (in its various compatible flavors) and NetWare386.andP;  These architectures will have roughly the same feature set.andP;  Both aregarnering an increasing number of third-party endorsements.andM;The choice will come down to how heterogeneous your work environment is(Novell will try to keep ahead of the others in terms of ports to diverseplatforms, including DEC and Next) and what API set you care to play with(OS/2 LAN Manager's or Novell's).andP;  All other arguments, including Novell'sclaim that it better preserves the operating environment options of thecustomer's machines (by sitting on top of each), will fall by the wayside asboth camps embrace interoperability and multiple protocols.andP;  (Microsoft isbeavering away at LM/X.)andP;  Customers may well want to settle on having thebest of both by using products such as Racal Interlan's LMN Server.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
