Reluctant to invest when times were good and they wereawash in listings, agents and brokers now languishing in thedown housing market are turning to computers to gain acompetitive edge.   About 50 computer companies had displays last week at theNational Association of Realtors' annual convention in LasVegas, Nev. Five years ago, by comparison, &quot;there weren'tfive&quot; computer vendors at the big trade show, says Richard J.Loughlin, president of Century 21 Real Estate Corp. &quot;The ageof technology has come to real estate,&quot; Mr. Loughlin says.&quot;The brokers realize they can better market real estate withcomputers.&quot;   The potential market for these computers is huge. With asfew as 15% of the nation's two million real-estate agentson-line with computers, vendors are developing a slew ofsoftware programs specially suited for the buying and sellingof homes.   Analytic Sciences, Reading., Ma., showed software in LasVegas that enables an agent to sit at a keyboard and create asales brochure for a property, complete with maps, picturesand comparative market analysis. &quot;It takes about five minutesto do this,&quot; including printing, says Richard W. Macy, thevendor's manager of property management services.   For the agent who is too busy to come into the office,Zenith Data Systems, Buffalo Grove, Ill., offers a 6.6-poundnotebook computer that automatically retrieves telephonemessages and can send and receive faxes. Though the computerisn't just for the real-estate business, Zenith officials sayit suits brokers' busy schedules.   Many real-estate agents who have made the plunge saycomputerization has been a big help. &quot;It's something everyRealtor should have, but they don't,&quot; Kenneth R. Baris,broker-manager of Jordan Baris in South Orange, N.J., says ofhis firm's use of computerized brochures. &quot;As a result, weare increasing our market share.&quot;   Herb Chisholm, associate broker of Re/Max Spirit inSeverna Park, Md., says he invested $5,000 in a computersystem six months ago to improve efficiency. &quot;The real-estateindustry is changing very quickly, and if you don't changeyou die,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Women's Impact Seen   In Group's Presidency                                                                                                          THE induction at last week's convention of Dorcas T.Helfant as the Realtor group's first woman president affirmedwomen's dominant membership role in the 750,000-memberorganization.   The proportion of women among the trade group's full-timesalespeople jumped to 64% in 1987, the year of the NAR'slatest membership study, from 37% in 1975. Women's share ofthose running offices also increased, to 36% from 18%.Altogether, women accounted for 52% of the NAR's membershiplast year.   Ms. Helfant, from Virginia Beach, Va., says women havepoured into the field because there is no &quot;glass ceiling&quot; tolimit their incomes. Jeannie Campbell-Anderson, president ofthe San Francisco Council of Women Realtors, says manyclients &quot;prefer to work with women {because} women canempathize . . . when there's a lot of emotion involved and alot of stress.&quot;   But women's rush into real estate appears to be ending.Harley E. Rouda, a Columbus, Ohio, broker and outgoing NARpresident, says women have gained so many other opportunitiesin the corporate world in recent years that their numbers inreal-estate are starting to subside.                                                                                                          And Now the Weather:   Sun, Clouds or Rain                                                                                                          SALES of existing single-family homes will either surge35% next year or sputter up barely 5%, depending on whichanalyst one cares to believe from the NAR's annual economicforecast presented at the convention.   The NAR's own chief economist, John A. Tuccillo, provideda somber forecast, predicting that single-family resaleswould rise 5.2% to 3,430,000 from this year's disappointinglylow levels.   More optimistic forecasts came from Barbara Allen, vicepresident of equity research for Kidder Peabody, whopredicted resales would rise as much as 12%, and LynnMichaelis, chief economist for forest-products companyWeyerhaeuser, who said 1992 resales could soar 35%.   Ms. Allen said the credit crunch is drying up the supplyof new homes, which eventually will push consumer demand intothe resale market. Mr. Michaelis says fixed interest rates,now below 9%, remain high relative to inflation, and buyerswill wait until they fall further.   But David Seiders, chief economist for the NationalAssociation of Home Builders, predicted a possible double-diprecession before the economy gains momentum in the spring.And Mr. Tuccillo says he believes that because the recessionwas mild, the recovery also will be mild.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          BETWEEN the high-tech exhibits at the trade show, Realtorsbrowsed through booths featuring such low-tech items ascustom name badges, magnetic business cards, boxer shortswith the Realtor logo, and T-shirts saying, &quot;Realtors makeyou feel at home.&quot; . . . Real-estate agents may not be makingmuch money now, but they gambled freely in Las Vegas. &quot;Peoplein the real-estate industry are gamblers by nature,&quot; saidChuck Cavanaugh, a Margate, N.J., agent hunched over ablackjack table at the Las Vegas Hilton.</TEXT></DOC>
