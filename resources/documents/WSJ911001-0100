In the latest case challenging the practices ofhome-warranty companies, a federal appeals court in Virginiaearlier this month required Denver-based Home BuyersWarranty, the nation's largest such company, to abide by anarbitrator's award of more than $200,000 to a policyholder.The company had sought to push the case into court.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, a jury in San Antonio, Texas, orderedHomeowners Warranty Corp., Arlington, Va., the nation'ssecond largest home-warranty company, to pay $483,000 indamages to an insured claimant whose house was falling apartbecause of a crack in the foundation. Homeowners Warranty,which denied coverage, had assured the buyers that all homesinsured under its program were inspected on a continuingbasis during construction -- a point that was contested attrial. Of the total jury award, $325,000 was for punitivedamages intended to deter future wrongdoing. The two sidesagreed to settle the case out of court for an undisclosedamount.   Terrence Cooke, corporate counsel for Homeowners Warranty,denied that his company or others in the industry attempt inany way to evade their responsibility to pay valid claims. Asin any area of insurance, policyholders must read theirpolicies carefully before maintaining that they have a claim,he said.   With developers facing intense financial pressure in thecurrent weak market, more and more home shoppers aredemanding insured warranty programs to pay for the cost ofdefective construction or unforeseen repairs to their newhomes. As many as 90% of new homeowners are purchasing suchpolicies, according to Bernard DiMuro, plaintiffs' lawyer inthe Virginia case. The policies usually cost several hundreddollars and cover major structural repairs for as many as 10years and less severe problems for one or two years.   With growing frequency, particularly in cases where thehomebuilder has gone out of business, the warranties areleading to disputes between the new homeowners and theinsurance company over whether the coverage applies under thecontract. Usually such disputes are heard by arbitrators.   &quot;The problem with a lot of these warranties is thateveryone who buys a house thinks they're covered, and lot oftimes they're not,&quot; said Marina Corodemus, a plaintiffs'lawyer in Perth Amboy, N.J., who has begun an informationexchange network for similar complaints through theAssociation of Trial Lawyers of America, the nationalplaintiffs' lawyers group. &quot;Homebuyers end up holding the bagat the point where the builders have bailed out,&quot; she said.   The issue before the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin Richmond, Va., centered on whether an arbitrator's awardof $206,605 in damages to a homeowner in one such dispute wasbinding, or whether it could be appealed by the insurerthrough the courts. National Home Insurance Co., theDenver-based underwriter for Home Buyers Warranty, had arguedthat either party had the option of appealing if dissatisfiedby the arbitration award.   But in a 12-page opinion, the appeals court ruled thatHome Buyers Warranty's contract language specificallyrequires binding arbitration. The decision affects &quot;virtuallyall&quot; of the 400,000 warranty contracts that Home BuyersWarranty has outstanding, said David Frosh, general counselfor National Home Insurance. Mr. Frosh said the decision cancut equally against a homeowner who is dissatisfied by anarbitrator's low award. &quot;We would like to leave all avenues{of appeal} open,&quot; he said.   But plaintiffs' lawyers said the opinion is more likely tofavor consumers because claims seldom are worth the cost ofhiring a lawyer and taking a case to court. &quot;The ordinaryclaim is about $3,000,&quot; said Mr. DiMuro, an attorney inAlexandria, Va., who won the Virginia appeals court decision.   ---   MOBIL CORP. unit's appeal of wrongful discharge verdict isdismissed.   A federal appeals court, in a one-line order, dismissedthe appeal of a $1.3 million wrongful-discharge verdict wonby Valcar Bowman Jr., the former manager for environmentalaffairs at Mobil Corp.'s Mobil Chemical Co. unit.   After a two-month trial in federal court in Newark, N.J.,a jury last year found that the company had wrongfully firedhim after he refused to violate environmental laws andpolicies. He claimed in his suit that he was fired in 1986 inretaliation for his refusal to remove environmental recordsfrom a Mobil plant in Bakersfield, Calif. The jury awardconsisted of $375,000 in compensatory damages, including lostwages and pain and suffering, and $1 million in punitivedamages.   Mobil has said that no coverup of environmental problemsoccurred and that the manager, based in Princeton, N.J., losthis job as part of a cost-cutting move. The company alsocontended that Mr. Bowman had antagonized his colleagues andbecame an ineffective manager.   The dismissal by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsin Philadelphia said the appeal failed for &quot;want ofjurisdiction.&quot; One attorney familiar with the case said theappeal hadn't been filed on a timely basis; however, thatcouldn't immediately be confirmed.   Lawyers for Mobil at the law firms Epstein Becker andamp; Greenand Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel were not in theiroffices yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment. A callto Mobil's headquarters wasn't returned.   ---   GASTON andamp; SNOW grapples with $20 million debt and the lossof lawyers.   The 147-year-old Boston-based law firm has endured theloss of about 80 lawyers in the last five years -- includingfour partners this week -- and is saddled with significantpayments on loans to cover operating expenses.   Richard N. Hoehn, chairman of Gaston andamp; Snow's executivecommittee, said that the firm has retained Francis Musselman-- the lawyer who oversaw the breakup of Finley, Kumble,Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey -- to &quot;talkabout the proper course of the firm's future.&quot; Mr. Hoehn saidthat the discussions with Mr. Musselman don't include theoption of dissolving the firm.   Richard J. Santagati, the former chief executive officerwho left the firm this month, said that Mr. Musselman's role&quot;should be perceived as an up not a down because of hisexperiences in these issues.&quot; Mr. Santagati said that Mr.Musselman is there &quot;to keep them together.&quot;   Like most Boston law firms, 180-lawyer Gaston andamp; Snow hasbeen hit hard by the recession. According to Allen CurtisGreer II, who left the New York office this summer for Rogersandamp; Wells, the firm took out about $15 million in loans tocover operating costs. Another $4 million to $5 million indebt was added when four members of the law firm Csaplar andamp;Bok joined the firm less than a year ago. Mr. Hoehn declinedto confirm the figures.   Mr. Greer said partners in the New York office wanted thefirm to take a hard line by slashing the shares of youngerpartners and the salaries of associates and laying othersoff. The Boston partners opposed that approach, he said. Mr.Greer said the firm has about $40 million in accountsreceivable and work-in-progress, so its long term financialpicture looks good. Banks will probably give the venerablelaw firm leeway in paying off the loans, Mr. Greer added.   In the past nine months, at least 14 partners had defectedfrom Gaston andamp; Snow to join Lord Day and Lord; Barrett Smith;Rogers and Wells; Mayer, Brown and Platt; and Morgan, Lewis andamp;Bockius. Mr. Hoehn said that four more -- Ernest V. Klein,Arnold P. Messing, Pamela Wilson and Rekha Parker -- tenderedtheir resignations last week.   ---   ANTITRUST GURU joins Liggett side in fight with Brown andamp;Williamson.   Liggett Group Inc., now called Brooke Group Ltd.,submitted an appeals brief signed solely by Harvard LawSchool Prof. Phillip Areeda, author of a widely usednine-volume treatise on antitrust law that has been cited asauthority in numerous appeals court decisions.   The brief, which contests a federal trial judge's decisionto throw out Liggett's $148.8 million jury verdict againstBrown andamp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. over pricing of cut-ratecigarettes, was submitted to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Richmond.   &quot;I do appeals briefs very rarely. I only sign things Ibelieve in,&quot; said Mr. Areeda, who also consulted informallywith Liggett's lawyers during the eight-month trial, whichended in March 1990.   Mr. Areeda argues in the complex antitrust case thatLiggett gave sufficient proof to the jury that Brown andamp;Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, London,unlawfully attempted to undercut Liggett's prices onso-called generic cigarettes in an effort to drive Liggettout of that market and enhance its own profits. The caserepresents an unusual application of the Robinson-Patman Act,a rarely used antitrust law.   The impression that top law professors can make adifference in corporate appeals appears to have intensifiedrecently. Word early this year that Harvard constitutionallaw Prof. Laurence Tribe would align with Genetics Institutein a patent fight with Amgen appeared to bolster Genetics'stock and damp Amgen's.   In the Liggett case, Brown andamp; Williamson asserts that itcompeted vigorously but lawfully. The company is representedon appeal by former federal judge Griffin Bell of King andamp;Spalding in Atlanta, among others. Oral arguments before theappeals court are scheduled for the first week in December.   ---   NOTED: Maine's highest court upheld a $250,000 limit ondamages, beyond medical expenses, that can be won in casesholding servers of alcohol liable for injuries caused byintoxicated persons they served. The cap had been challengedon constitutional grounds, but the court said the limitationachieved the legitimate goal of deterring bartenders andothers from serving intoxicated persons while moderating thecost of liability insurance.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          HOME OWNERS WARRANTY Corp., of Arlington, Va., is thebiggest provider of home warranty policies in the nation,based on the number of individual policies outstanding. Anarticle in the Sept. 19 edition said another company, HomeBuyers Warranty of Denver, is the biggest such provider inthe nation, based on the number of contractors and buildermembers it has signed up. The number of policies outstandingis the more accurate measure of size.   (WSJ Oct. 1, 1991)   910919-0125</TEXT></DOC>
