(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! It's time for theSixth Annual Shemp Festival.   ``Grand Moron'' Leo Honeycutt of WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge was topreside over events today and Sunday to honor former Three Stoogesmember Shemp Howard.   Among the festivities is the Hoi Polloi Ball, a monster piefight with 1,000 custard pies, and a Pie Queen contest.   The festival is the brainchild of assistant Fire Chief KirkLandry, mechanic James B. LeBlanc and state Deputy Fire MarshalAaron Hebert.   Proceeds go to the Fire Department in Donaldsonville, about 55miles west of New Orleans.   The pie queen's crown, made from an unfilled pie shell, is notnecessarily given to the most gorgeous entrant.   ``It's got nothing to do with looks. Of course, that doesn'thurt,'' Landry said Friday. ``It's 10 percent attire, 30 percentparticipation and the other 60 percent is judged on degeneration.''</TEXT></DOC>
