The Newark, N.J.-based insurance company, which owns the office building in downtown Dallas and is thus a potential target of asbestos litigation itself, is also asking to be indemnified from future health claims that could be attributed to asbestos in the building.    Real-estate investment advisers said the damages sought by Prudential are among the largest in a flurry of such claims arising from real estate transactions involving asbestos-contaminated buildings. Investors have shied away from buildings with asbestos problems in recent years, and real-estate brokers report difficulty in leasing those buildings.    &quot;This is potentially the biggest problem in the history of real estate,&quot; said Jerry Fults, president of Fults andamp; Co., a Dallas real-estate brokerage firm. He said the dollars required to clean up all the nation's contaminated buildings and the liability for health claims from asbestosis -- an illness caused by asbestos particles -- could be enormous.    Prudential and InterFirst Bank Corp., one of two bank holding companies merged to form First RepublicBank last year, jointly built the skyscraper in 1974. In 1984, Prudential bought InterFirst's half-interest.    Both First RepublicBank and Prudential declined to comment on the lawsuit.    In its suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, Prudential claims InterFirst withheld information about an Environmental Protection Agency test that showed the building contained asbestos hazards. Prudential's suit also alleges that the bank holding company &quot;in order to induce Prudential&quot; to buy InterFirst's 50% interest in the building, &quot;willfully, knowingly and purposefully made express warranties regarding the absence of material defects and significant adverse conditions in Renaissance Tower.&quot;    Asbestos was widely used in construction until the late 1970s, when reports of health problems from asbestos-contaminated buildings began to surface.    If Prudential receives a favorable ruling on the lawsuit, it would represent another financial blow to the troubled Dallas bank. First RepublicBank reported a net loss of $1.5 billion in the first quarter, the second-largest in banking history, as result of souring real estate loans and loans to lesser-developed countries.    In March, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. injected $1 billion in the company's Dallas and Houston bank units to prevent their collapse, and First RepublicBank has been a steady borrower of emergency funds from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.    First RepublicBank has already been hammered by several class-action suits accusing management of misrepresenting the financial condition of Republic Bank, InterFirst's merger partner.    First RepublicBank isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco. </TEXT></DOC>
