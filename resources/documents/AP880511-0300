Crude oil futures were mostly higher, gasoline futures generallydeclined and heating oil was mixed Tuesday on the New YorkMercantile Exchange.   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, settled down 8 cents at $17.46 per barrel. Most othercontract months showed small gains.
