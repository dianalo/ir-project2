Troopers stopped and questioned people, searched bags and tookaway suspects for further questioning. Police officials said morethan 500 people were arrested.   It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blockeda protest in Seoul with a massive show of police strength.

Opposition tothe dissidents has increased since seven riot troopers were killedby radical students earlier this month.   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissidentalliance which called for protests in Seoul and 10 other cities,had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide.The only other reported protest involved about 2,000 people in thesouthern city of Kwangju.   About 300 radical students continued a hunger protest for asecond day at Myongdong Roman Catholic Cathedral in the city centertoday to demand the fall of Roh and a government admission thatpolice killed a radical student. Riot police ringed the cathedralbut made no move to stop the protest.   Some of the hunger strikers bit their fingers to draw blood,with which they wrote anti-government slogans.

Dissidents are demanding an investigation into the death of LeeChol-kyu, who they claim was tortured and killed by police. Hisbody was found in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city ofKwangju.
