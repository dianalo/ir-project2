Glass substratesand stainless substrates used for solar cells for power generation haverespective shortcomings. The former is much heavier than the latter andrefuses the roll-to-roll process resulting in very high cost and thelatter has troubles in each of its several forming processes such asdifficulty of obtaining a membrane without pinhole or its high productioncost, etc.. In this invention, a mixed liquid of at least one kind ofmetal alkoxide, at least one kind of organic metal compound which ispresented as RMe(OR') (R; low alkyl group and phenyl group, R'; low alkylgroup, and Me; metal), water and organic solvent with addition whenevernecessary of acid or fine powdered silica is dessolved through hydrolysisto make partial condensation. Then an insulating membrane is obtainedby conducting coating and sintering of the sol liquid obtaind from theabove partial condensation on a substrate more than once. The sinteringtemperature is 500{sup 0}C or less. (1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
