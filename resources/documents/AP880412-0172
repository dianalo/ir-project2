The purpose of the intrusions and the exact identity of theintruders were not clear, he said.   The facility stores fuel for U.S. airplanes and vehicles atnearby Howard Air Force Base, he said.   ``When one has intruders into the base perimeter, who are inuniform and are camouflaged, the assumption that one comes to isthat, of course, they are PDF,'' or members of the PanamanianDefense Force, said Howard.   No intruders were apprehended. ``In the confusion of the firing,the intruders all escaped,'' said U.S. Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers,a spokesman at U.S. Southern Command.   The Marine was identified as Cpl. Ricardo M. Villahermosa, 25,of Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was part of I Company, 3rd Battalion,4th Marine Regiment, part of the 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigadeand was sent from Camp LeJeune, N.C., to Panama as part of astrengthened security force last week, officials said.   Villahermosa was struck by at least one shot in the abdomen, andwas pronounced dead at Gorgas Hospital in Panama.   Attempts to revive the Marine with open-heart massage wereunsuccessful. Several major arteries were hit by the bullet and theMarine suffered massive internal bleeding, Sconyers said.   Describing the incident as a ``tragic accident,'' Howard toldreporters at the Pentagon that it ``occurred after an apparentintrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area.''   ``U.S. security forces patrolling the area split up and were inthe process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off, soundinglike gunfire,'' he said.   ``In response, two elements of the patrol fired. Seven roundswere discharged before the on-the-scene commander ordered aceasefire. Initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound wasnot the result of hostile gunfire, but rather the result of acrossfire from the U.S. shots fired,'' he said.   ``Details of the incident are sketchy at this time,'' he said,and the matter is under investigation.   In another accident, two U.S. Army UH-60A Blackhawk helicopterscarrying a total of eight soldiers collided during a night trainingexercise at an airstrip at Fort Sherman in Panama, Howard said.   ``The soldiers were conducting routine training involvingfamiliarization with night-vision devices immediately prior to thecrash,'' at about 10:45 p.m. EDT Monday night, said the spokesman.   The soldiers, assigned to the First Battalion, 228 AviationRegiment, in Panama, were treated for minor injuries, he said.   The accident came just over a month after two UH-60 helicopterscollided during a night training mission and crashed 250 feet tothe ground, killing 17 servicemen near Fort Campbell Army Air Fieldin Kentucky.   The Blackhawk is one of the Army's newest helicopters, but hasbeen grounded several times. Last summer, officials said that about40 people had been killed in crashes of the helicopter since 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
