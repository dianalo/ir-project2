 We set aside important pieces of E-mail, we filememos or letters for future reference, our hard drives fill with Internetnews-feeds and results of dial-up information queries, our electronic ticklerfiles burgeon--and still, despite the best of intentions, informationcritical to running our businesses falls through the cracks.andM;There exists a nascent category of software that can help us out of thismess.andP;  Text and graphics, indeed multimedia, retrieval systems can deal withthis  soft,&quot; or unstructured, information in important ways that traditionaldatabases cannot.andP;  We believe the most strategic applications in the next fewyears will be those that afford users the ability to easily gather, store,manipulate, and retrieve unstructured information.andP;  The Office ComputingGroup is so bullish on this genre of software, in fact, that we havecommitted considerable resources to prototype what we refer to internally asour Knowledge Base.andP;  We will continue to expand the range of products weconsider--we will look at conferencing systems and remote access software andalso at retrieval mechanisms.andP;  TEXTWARE.andP;  One example of a retrieval systemis TextWare, a product that has been available from Unibase SystemsIncorporated, since 1987.andP;  Recently, a combination of events refocused ourattention on this product.andP;  We learned that a new release was available thatpromised to incorporate graphics along with text, that the new product wasbeing used by a number of significant companies in demanding situations, andthat the employees of Unibase obtained the exclusive development andmarketing rights for the product and formed TextWare Corporation.andM;&quot;TextWare&quot; encompasses a series of software products for full-text indexingand retrieval applications.andP;  TextWare, TextWare with Images, Retrieve (orread-only) versions of both, and the TextWare Toolkit are fully releasedproducts.andP;  The Office Computing Group continues to examine the first two; theToolkit, a linkable library of subroutines, is available to VARs wishing tointegrate this technology into new or existing applications.andP;  TEXTWARE INACTION.andP;  With TextWare, word processing and ASCII files can remain in theirnative file formats (formats including Word Perfect, XyWrite, and WordStar)or be imported into TextWare's proprietary format to form one or more textualdatabases called CardFiles.andP;  Users can divide individual CardFiles intouser-definable categories labeled as Documents and smaller chunks ofinformation called Cards.andP;  Users can also define short descriptions ofinformation for each Card, which TextWare will display on a &quot;hit list&quot; ofCards that contain the results of a search to assist users in locating theinformation desired.andP;  Finally, users can implement a kind of hypertext bybuilding related Cards that will be tagged to one another for retrievalpurposes.andP;  These various processes can be completed by using either defaultoptions or user-defined parameters to address unique requirements.andP;  DISKSPACE VERSUS PERFORMANCE.andP;  Clearly, TextWare's strength is in performance,not disk space.andP;  While indexing times vary, files can typically beautomatically indexed at a rate of more than 2MB per hour on a standard 286machine.andP;  As a result of Textware's indexing algorithm, searches producetruly instantaneous results.andP;  As an example, the Office Computing Groupplaced more than four megabytes of news-feeds and internal E-mail into asingle CardFile residing on our office LAN.andP;  Regardless of the complexity ofthe search, a results fist always appeared on the screen within two seconds.andO;In addition to searches using the typical Boolean operators, TextWare allowsphrase and proximity searches, which may be restricted to Documents withinCardFiles when necessary.andM;The trade-off for this speed is predictable.andP;  As a result of TextWare'sindexing, an index file 10 to 25 percent the size of the original text fileis created, as are a handful of (much smaller) files used in variousoperations against the created CardFile.andP;  (To be fair in this discussion ofthe penalties of speed, we should point out that if a user elects to forgothe possibility of editing the CardFiles, TextWare offers a file-compressionutility that reduces the size of the index and datafiles by up to 50percent.)andM;As mentioned above, the searches result in a &quot;hit list,&quot; which assists usersin choosing which Card or Cards to view first in order to find theinformation desired.andP;  The full text of selected Cards is displayed in itsoriginal format with the search words highlighted and a prompt to alert theuser to press a function key to view any related Card(s).andP;  Individual Cardsor a group of marked Cards can be sent to an ASCII file, a printer, or aWordPerfect Clipboard.andP;  The user can index edited data and append it to aCardFile rather than reindex the entire CardFile.andP;  AND PICTURES, TOO.andO;TextWare with Images incorporates all the basic functionality outlined aboveand adds image retrieval, display, and output capabilities.andP;  Images in theMedia Cyberetic's Dr. Halo CUT file format can be tagged to one or moreindividual Cards, and, when the Card is displayed, a prompt will alert theuser to press a function key to view any tagged image(s).andP;  Displayed imagescan then be sent to one of a large selection of output devices.andM;Our initial reaction to having to use the  .CUT&quot; format was that it wouldlimit the effectiveness of the product.andP;  What TextWare does, however, isinclude a utility program that allows conversion to and from a number ofmajor bit-mapped and vector formats (including TEFF, PIC, MacPaint, GIF, BIT,and WordPerfect Graphics Format--WPG).andP;  Still missing, however, and a featurewe'd like to see included, is the ability to use ANSI-standard ComputerGraphics Metafile (CGM) images.andP;  A DIVERSITY OF PLATFORMS.andP;  TextWare and itsvarious off-the-shelf versions are currently available for MSDOS and LANenvironments.andP;  A company spokesperson has stated that both Unix/Xenix andMacintosh versions will be supported in the near future.andP;  The TextWareToolkit is now available for all of these environments.andP;  If TextWare's broadhints about the near future status of the additional platforms come to pass,this will position the product uniquely in a field with its competitors.andO;What remains to be seen, of course, is how interchangeable data and indexeswill be among the various platforms.andP;  SUMMARY.andP;  TextWare and TextWare withImages are priced from $495 to $724, respectively, and Retrieve (orread-only) versions start at $99.andP;  We are impressed by the product'susefulness, performance, and by the promise of its diversification to themajor desktop architectural platforms.andP;  We strongly believe that text andgraphics retrieval systems are poised to grow in a highly significant nichein the software market.andP;  Initially, these systems will be used to drivestandalone applications (such as online documentation) and as adjuncts toelectronic publishing.andP;  It is the medium- to longterm outlook that is of themost interest.andP;  The perspective of the Office Computing Group is that suchretrieval engines represent the tip of a strategic iceberg.andP;  We anticipatethe need to manipulate information that is textual, audial, and visual; thatis accessible to users across heterogeneous, distributed platforms; and thatcan be accessed by an increasingly peripatetic labor force.andP;  The Grand Visionis nothing less than creating a matrix of linkages among information workerswho are separate by distance and time from each other as well as from anyparticular &quot;workplace,&quot; and the constantly evolving collective intelligenceof any corporate body.andP;  The earliest steps on this long prototyping journeyhave begun with software that allows us to make sense of the growing mass ofwords and images.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
