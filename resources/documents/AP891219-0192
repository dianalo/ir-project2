The official said Monday that the 12-nation trading bloc wantsthe tariffs reduced because of legislation requiring U.S.commissaries in Europe to buy their beef from American _ notEuropean _ producers. Commissaries are stores for U.S. military andother personnel.   The official, who demanded anonymity, said the purchases plustransportation costs were expected to amount to about $55 million,which he described as an ``extra penalty'' applied by the Americansin the dispute.   The United States slapped duties of about $100 million on avariety of European products to retaliate for the ban on imports ofmeat from cattle treated with growth hormones. Some of the dutieshave been eased slightly since the prohibition went into effectlast Jan. 1.   Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trading official, and RayMacSharry, its agriculture chief, requested the tariffs be liftedin a Dec. 1 letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutterand U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. No response has yet beenreceived.   Foreign ministers of the 12 community nations discussed thedispute at a meeting Monday and asked to be kept informed of theAmerican reaction, the official said.   The banned meat affects only a tiny part of the $166 billion in1988 trade between the trading partners.   The community official also said the trading bloc wasconsidering accepting the conclusions but not critical findings ofan international trade panel that ruled in favor of the UnitedStates in a dispute over soybean subsidies.   The official said the community would be willing to do soprovided that the United States refrained from imposing unilateraltrade measures violating international trade rules.   Last week, a panel of the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade, found that community subsidies to processors andproducers of soybeans hurt trade. Details of the soybean decisionhave not been released.   U.S. soybean producers complained in December 1987 thatcommunity subsidies had cut into American exports to Europe. TheAmerican Soybean Association argued that the payments encouragedfarmers to grow oilseeds, which then reduced the demand forAmerican imports.   The community argued the erosion of the European market waslargely due to increases in cheaper imports from Brazil andArgentina.</TEXT></DOC>
