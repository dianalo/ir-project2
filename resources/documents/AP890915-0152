Billington, the librarian of Congress, told a Senate subcommittee.   ``The major information resources for this nation reside in theLibrary of Congress and other research libraries across the country.These collections have been assembled in many cases with federal,state and local revenues.   ``Our citizens have a right to expect that these irreplaceableintellectual resources be made ever more widely available through anational information network,'' he said.   Billington testified in favor of a bill sponsored by Sen. AlGore, D-Tenn., which calls for the establishment of nationalcomputer-based research network. Gore chairs the Senate Commercescience subcommittee, which held Friday's hearing.   ``Books would be stored digitally on magnetic tape, compact discsor on computers,'' Gore said. ``Using a computer, library patronscould access information from the books in the library's collection.   ``Thousands of books could be on-line, available at the touch ofa button,'' Gore said, adding that the technology already exists.   The Library of Congress, with 88 million items, is the largestcollection of recorded and printed information ever assembled in asingle place, Billington said.   One of the questions that needs to be resolved before thenationwide network is built is how to ensure copyright protection,the Association of American Publishers told the panel.   ``Use of public domain materials only could create an expectationin the user community that any information in the system could beused freely without regard to copyright,'' the group said in astatement.</TEXT></DOC>
