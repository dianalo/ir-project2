Under its rule proposal, the department would relax its inspection of processing plants with good records of compliance and focus instead on problem plants. Currently, every plant is inspected daily for sanitation and food wholesomeness.    At a news briefing yesterday, Lester Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, acknowledged that as a result of the new approach the number of inspectors would decline to 1,100 from 2,200 through attrition over a four-year period. The budget saving has been estimated at $27 million a year, he said.    But Mr. Crawford insisted that the department wasn't cutting back on meat and poultry inspection. &quot;Under the proposal, USDA would increase inspection at processing plants where records indicate a need for additional oversight,&quot; he said. &quot;By the same token, plants with good records of compliance could be visited less than daily.&quot;    The proposal covers 6,300 meat and poultry-processing plants nationwide, including producers of hot dogs, beef stews, luncheon meats and packaged entrees. It wouldn't alter the continuous inspection system at slaughterhouses.    The American Meat Institute, a trade group, embraced the proposed changes as a &quot;major step forward,&quot; while consumer advocates contended that they wouldn't enhance consumer protection.    &quot;The vast majority of meat-processing plants have quality control procedures in place, which will facilitate compliance with the new system,&quot; the meat institute said in a statement.    But Thomas Devine, an attorney for the Government Accountability Project, a public watchdog group, warned that the department's plan to conduct random, periodic inspections -- once every two weeks, perhaps -- would mean heavy reliance on the processor's books.    &quot;It's an honors system because basically the industry will be policing itself,&quot; said Mr. Devine. &quot;The only way to check the industry's integrity is through paperwork reviews.&quot;    Department officials disputed Mr. Devine's assertion that &quot;the personnel won't be there to provide the stepped-up enforcement.&quot; The officials also said that they have stronger enforcement powers under a 1986 law that gave the department six years to experiment with the new inspection system. In 1992, Congress will review its effectiveness.    &quot;The industry will have to assume greater responsibility in conforming to USDA standards, because critical deficiencies found during inspection would mean production delays and product condemnation,&quot; said Mr. Crawford.    Some of the proposed changes were recommended by the National Academy of Sciences in a food-safety study, he added.    The department has conducted three pilot tests of the new system, involving 14 processing plants in Tennessee, 48 in the Chicago area and 78 in the Raleigh, N.C., area. In each test, compliance with food safety and other regulations was generally found to improve, department officials said.    The public has 90 days in which to comment on the proposal, which wouldn't change any safety or labeling standards. The new system could be started by mid-1989. </TEXT></DOC>
