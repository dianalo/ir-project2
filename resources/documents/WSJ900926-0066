Most Parents Don't Mind                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   MOST PARENTS are happy to have adult children living withthem -- but there are important exceptions.   William Aquilino and Khalil Supple of the University ofWisconsin's Center for Demography investigated relationshipsin a representative sample of over 600 families where parentshad &quot;co-resident&quot; young adult children, ones between ages 19and 34. They asked the parents about the frequency ofdisagreements and quarrels, whether there was much shoutingand bad blood, the amount of pleasurable time spent with theadult children and in general how well the livingarrangements were working out.   The result: A full 70% of the parents were well satisfiedwith the co-resident situation. Only one in four reporteddisagreements as often as once a week, and the intensity ofthe arguments &quot;appeared to be quite low.&quot; Moreover, most ofthe parents recounted frequent enjoyable conversations andshared leisure activities with the child.   If the children were unemployed or otherwise financiallydependent, however, parent-child conflict increased. Thereturn home of a divorced or separated child often strainedrelationships, too -- particularly with fathers. Ifgrandchildren were also brought back into the nest,additional strain was reported by both mothers and fathers.                                                                                                          Poor Mothers Share   Traits, Aid or No                                                                                                          WELFARE MOTHERS and poor mothers not on welfare have manycharacteristics in common.   Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization based inWashington, analyzed several large government surveys to seehow women getting help from the government's Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children program differed from poor mothersnot receiving such help and also from mothers with greaterincomes.   Not surprisingly, both the AFDC and the other poor motherstend to be younger than mothers who aren't poor, consisted oflarger proportions of minorities, had less schooling and didless well on intelligence tests, and had somewhat largerfamilies (though not as large as in former years, theresearchers note).   What was unexpected, though, were the many similaritiesbetween the two impoverished groups. For example, 31% of eachgroup had their first child before they were 17 and anotherone-fourth before they were 20. Nearly one-third of eachgroup held the traditional attitude that mothers of youngkids shouldn't work, and another 30% leaned that way.   Just about half of each group had finished high school andanother 12% had some college as well -- figures the analysischaracterizes as &quot;higher than often assumed.&quot; Despite this,intelligence test scores of both the AFDC mothers and thenon-welfare poor mothers were well below average and almostidentically so.   But there were differences between the AFDC mothers andthe other poor mothers, of course. Many more AFDC mothers hadnever been married, while many more non-AFDC poor weredivorced, separated, or widowed. More AFDC mothers were blackor Hispanic, and the AFDC group was also more likely to havealcohol-related problems.                                                                                                          States of Health Vary   From State to State                                                                                                          MINNESOTA and Utah are the healthiest states, Alaska theleast healthy.   So says a complex rating system developed by NorthwesternNational Life Insurance Co. The system, worked out with thehelp of a panel of health experts, ranks states on the basisof weights assigned to 17 different components of health,subdivided into five broad categories: life style, access tohealth care, incidence of major diseases, extent of disablinginjuries and sicknesses, and death rates. Included in lifestyle, for instance, are the prevalence of smoking, amount ofviolent crime, number of auto deaths, prevalence of obesityand other factors contributing to heart disease, andpercentage of high school graduates.   Utah won a tie for first place for overall healthiness bycoming in first in the life-style category and ranking wellon mortality, disease and disability, though it was only 20thon access to health care. Minnesota tied with Utah by gettinghigh grades on disease, mortality, access to health care, andlife style, though it didn't do so well on the disabilityscale.   New Hampshire and Hawaii were close behind the top two,followed by Nebraska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wisconsinand Iowa. Connecticut ranked first on access to health care,North Dakota had the lowest death rates, Wyoming had the bestrecord on major diseases, and Hawaii had the leastdisability.   Other than Alaska, the states ranked the worst were WestVirginia, Mississippi, Nevada, Louisiana and New Mexico.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          AVERAGE child-support payments by absent fathers increased16% in real terms from 1985 to 1987, the Census Bureaureports. This contrasts with a drop of 12% from 1983 to 1985.. . . Catholic schools enroll 54% of all private schoolstudents, according to the Department of Education. Otherreligious schools account for 30% and nonsectarian schoolsfor the remaining 16%. . . . Elderly white women in theSoutheast suffer substantially more hip fractures than thosein the North, University of Illinois epidemiologistsdiscover. They admit they have found no good explanation forthis variation. . . . The government's Agency for Health CarePolicy estimates that over 13 million Americans, includingone out of six between the ages of 45 and 65, have a disabledelderly parent or spouse.</TEXT></DOC>
