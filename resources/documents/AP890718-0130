TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli officials are increasing pressure on theBush administration to halt its dialogue with Yasser Arafat'sPalestine Liberation Organization.   As part of the campaign, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on Tuesdayinstructed more than 100 Israeli embassies and missions abroad todistribute a report alleging the PLO had not abandoned terror.   It was Arafat's pledge in December that cleared the way for thedialogue with the United States, and Israeli officials hope they canforce an end to the dialogue by showing the PLO broke its word.   The report, compiled by Israeli security officials, said Arafat'sFatah faction had launched 70 anti-Israeli attacks this year, 10 ofwhich were carried out within Israel's pre-1967 borders.   In an earlier report, the Foreign Ministry listed nine attemptsby PLO groups to cross Israel's northern border from Lebanon betweenDecember and June.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Danny Naveh also noted ``a dramaticincrease'' in attacks on Palestinians by other Palestinians, sayingit coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace initiative,approved by the Cabinet on May 14.   The proposal calls for Palestinian representatives to be electedto negotiate interim autonomy for the occupied territories. Thefinal status of the areas would be determined in later talks.   ``Right after the prime minister's initiative was launched therewas a dramatic increase in the murder of Arabs by Arabs,'' saidNaveh. ``We believe it is the result of PLO terrorism in Judea,Samaria (West Bank) and the Gaza Strip.''   As evidence, he noted the report said the number of Palestinianskilled by other Arabs rose from an average 1.6 per month in 1988 to14 per month in June 1989.   Arens told parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee onMonday that he had met recently with more than 10 Palestinians fromthe West Bank and Gaza and all said they would not participate inthe elections plan for fear of reprisal from the PLO.   ``Palestinian personalities with whom I met told me that anybodywho presents his candidacy for elections without PLO suport may findhimself dead in 24 hours,'' Arens told the committee.   In a speech to U.S. fundraisers later in the day, Arens attackedWestern leaders for meeting PLO officials.   ``Leaders of the Western world who meet with terror heads createthe perception with Palestinians on the ground (here) that they haveno choice but to surrender to the pressure and fear of PLO terror,''said Arens.   In support of the claim, the report said Palestinians carried out1,403 assaults this year, 710 against Jews and the rest againstother Arabs.   Since the start of the uprising in December 1987, it said a totalof 64 Palestinians have been killed and 243 wounded by otherPalestinians.   By Associated Press count, 512 Palestinians have been killed byIsraelis, most of them shot to death by soldiers. The AP lists 82Palestinians killed by other Palestinians since Dec. 8, 1987.   Most of the victims have been described by Arab reporters andresidents as either collaborators with Israeli authorities or drugdealers and prostitutes. Few of those attacked have been politicaldissidents, according to Palestinian sources.   With increasing pointedness, Israeli officials have urged U.S.diplomats and visiting U.S. Jewish leaders to persuade the Bushadministration to abandon its dialogue with the PLO, which theyclaim is undermining the election plan.   ``The U.S. must decide whether to support the peace initiativeand its dialogue with the PLO. The two are mutually incompatible,''Yossi Ben Aharon, the director-general of the prime ministry, saidearlier this week.   ``The only chance for a dialogue can be through a dialogue withthe Arabs here and the PLO is an obstacle to that understanding.There is no way to bridge that gap because we will never deliver thePalestinian population to the PLO.''   The Israeli campaign is likely to gain force following Tuesday'sdeath of Rita Levine, 39, of Philadelphia. She died of injuriessuffered in the July 6 Palestinian attack on an Israeli bus thatleft 14 other people dead and 26 injured.   Israeli officials hope their campaign will persuade a majority inthe U.S. Congress to order a halt to the dialogue. In response, Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has introduced legislation that would barU.S.-PLO talks unless President Bush certified participants had noconnection to acts of terror.   But the campaign by right-wingers is undercut by liberals in thecoalition government who advocate direct dealings with the PLO andargue that Israel is already conducting an indirect politicaldialogue with the PLO .   ``For months, clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have beenunderway between the Israeli government headed by Yitzhak Shamir, vithe Americans,'' said Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin of theLabor Party.</TEXT></DOC>
