The Labor Department said the January-March increase followed a1.6 percent rise in the final three months of 1987. For the past 12months, import prices have risen 7.1 percent.   The price of foreign oil and other energy products fell 8percent during the first quarter. If this drop in energy prices wasremoved, import prices would have risen a much faster 2.3 percentin the past three months.   Foreign cars and machinery, which account for nearly half of allU.S. imports, rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter afterincreasing 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.   Analysts said the latest government statistics confirm theirview that the weaker dollar, which makes imports more expensive, isresponsible for about half the inflation the country is nowexperiencing.   Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in 1987 and analysts said thatincrease would have been only about 2 percent without the rise inimport costs.   ``The dollar has been going down and we don't think all of thathas been passed through to consumers yet,'' said David Wyss, aneconomist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``Foreignproducers had been eating much of the dollar's decline in lowerprofits, but they can't do that anymore.''   The import price report said that from January from March, thedollar lost 1.4 percent of its value on a trade-weighted basiscompared with a 5.8 percent plunge in the October-December quarter.   The Reagan administration, led by Treasury Secretary James A.Baker III, began working with U.S. allies in September 1985 todrive the value of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink thecountry's huge foreign trade deficits. A weaker dollar makesAmerican goods more competitive on overseas markets while drivingup the cost of imports to Americans.   In February 1987, after the dollar had fallen by almost 50percent against the Japanese yen and the West German mark, themajor industrial countries switched course and began trying to keepthe dollar from falling further.   That effort was unsuccessful in 1987 because stubbornly highmerchandise trade deficits made investors believe the dollar hadnot dropped enough to cure the country's trade problems. Only twoweeks ago, the dollar fell sharply because of a widening of theFebruary U.S. trade deficit.   While the U.S. merchandise trade deficit hit a record high of$171.2 billion last year, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeuttersaid Thursday that a new analysis by his office showed that thecountry's trade deficit has actually fallen by 23.2 percent sincemid-1986, when the effects of the weaker dollar are removed.   He said the monthly trade report, which does not factor outinflation, has masked the improvements that have been occurring involume terms.   But Wyss said financial markets will continue to react tomonthly trade figures in current dollars until they start showingsignificant improvements as well.   ``U.S. export volume is growing very rapidly, but unfortunatelynot fast enough to overcome the sharp increases in import prices,''he said.   The Labor Department report said the cost of American productsbeing sold overseas rose by 1.4 percent during the first quarter, adrop from a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of1987. This change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost ofexported food products, which rose only 0.6 percent in the firstquarter after shooting up by 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter.   American grain prices rose 3.1 percent following a 14.2 percentjump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped offsetcontinued increases in rice and corn prices.   The price of American meat products rose 5.1 percent followingsix months of declines, while the index for fruits and vegetablesfell for the fourth consecutive quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
