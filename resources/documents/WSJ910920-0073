The transaction catapults the privately held greeting cardcompany from virtually no presence in the cable industry intothe ranks of the top 20 cable operators. Hallmark earlierthis year formed Crown, based in Dallas, with cable industryveteran James Hoak, who was co-founder and chief executiveofficer of Heritage Communications Inc., a cable company withone million subscribers acquired in 1987 byTele-Communications Inc. Mr. Hoak is chairman of Crown.</LP><TEXT>   Although terms weren't disclosed, Hallmark is believed tobe putting up about $200 million in equity and taking onCencom debt to acquire control of the company, which owns andoperates systems serving 550,000 subscribers. Cable industrybrokers and investment bankers said the deal was valued atwell over $2,000 per subscriber, or as much as 10 or 11 timescash flow.   Cencom, which is itself 32%-owned by cable giantTele-Communications, directly owns systems serving 150,000subscribers; the other 400,000 are served by systems owned byCencom affiliated partnerships that the company manages. Withits equity investment, however, Hallmark gets control overthe entire subscriber base, and the ability to buy out theother investors in the partnerships down the road. In asmaller recent transaction, Hallmark acquired systems serving150,000 subscribers by buying out Jones Intercable Inc.; thecombined deals give Hallmark more than 700,000 cablesubscribers.   The Hallmark deal is the third such entry by deep-pocketednew investors in the cable television business in recentmonths. Buy-out firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. recentlyformed a partnership with Cablevision Industries Inc., basedin Liberty, N.Y., to spend as much as $1 billion to buy cablesystems. Earlier this month, Des Moines, Iowa, publisherMeredith Corp. formed a partnership with another formerHeritage Communications group to buy cable systems. Meredithsaid it would contribute $100 million to the partnership, andborrow $200 million to $300 million more to buy properties.   And other investors are waiting in the wings. AmericanExpress Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit andBlackstone Group, two Wall Street firms with significantpools of capital, say they are exploring the cable market.   Brian Deevey, president of cable broker Daniels andamp;Associates, figures that with new investors borrowing againsttheir equity investments, there may be as much as $3 billionof new funds chasing cable systems. And if the reportedper-subscriber price of more than $2,000 for the Cencomsystems is correct, he says, it may spur more owners, whowouldn't let their systems go at bargain prices, to thinkabout selling. &quot;Systems that people have owned and held offthe market for a while may now become available,&quot; he said.   Indeed, there have been virtually no major transactions inthe last couple of years, as once robust cable-systems salesslowed to a near halt. Buyers and sellers were far apart onprice, and many systems being actively shopped were taken offthe market. The cable industry piled on debt with abandon inthe 1980s, but financing dried up in the 1990s. The threat ofnew regulation on the cable industry also put a damper onsales.   But banks now appear to be more willing to financeindustry transactions again, particularly in deals withstrong equity players. The fundamentals of the cable industryremain strong, with cash flow growing at a healthy rate.Unlike most media businesses, cable systems are dependentprimarily on subscriber fees for revenue rather than onadvertising, and have thus been relatively recession-proof.Steven Rattner, a managing director at Lazard Freres andamp; Co.,who advised KKR on its deal, said the interest of new playerslike Hallmark &quot;demonstrates there are major values in cablesystems.&quot;   Mr. Hoak, the Crown chairman, said Hallmark also isinterested in buying interests in cable televisionprogramming. Hallmark already owns Spanish language networkUnivision Inc. and its television systems through a separatesubsidiary.   Cencom, which is based in St. Louis, will continue at itscurrent headquarters under current management, includingRobert A. Brooks, chairman, and Howard L. Wood, president andchief executive, Mr. Hoak said. Cencom said no significantstaffing or operational changes are planned. In addition tothe St. Louis area, Cencom serves subscribers in Alabama,California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois and Kansas, amongother states.   Cencom said it had been searching for &quot;a stable, long terminvestor&quot; to help it sustain growth.</TEXT></DOC>
