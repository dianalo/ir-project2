Analysts say the parliamentary elections Nov. 22, 24 and 26 maybe the closest since India gained independence from Britain 42years ago.   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, leader of the Janata Dal party, filedhis nomination papers in the Fatehpur district barely half an hourbefore the deadline on a day filled with delay and diversion.   He had been airborne 28 minutes when his plane, part of thegovernment-run Vayudoot Airlines fleet, returned to New Delhibecause of a bomb threat.   Singh conducted a protest at the airport, United News of Indiareported. After a three-hour delay, in which no bomb was found butan unspecified technical problem was reported, the plane again tookoff for Kanpur, the nearest airport to Fatehpur.   After that, Singh had to drive two hours to reach Fatehpur intime, an aide in New Delhi said.   The 58-year-old opposition leader, a former ally of PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi who has served him as defense and financeminister, claimed Gandhi's governing Congress Party was responsible.   ``It is a defeat of the government,'' said N.C. Jain, a JanataDal official. ``He reached Fatehpur barely 30 minutes before thenominations were to close, but he did it.''   Both Gandhi and Singh are running for Parliament seats fromUttar Pradesh state, east of New Delhi. Gandhi filed Oct. 24 as acandidate in the Amethi district.   Singh's charges are among several unrelated problems besettingGandhi.   Last week, the forestry minister was accused of making improperadvances to an environmentalist. On Monday, the defense ministerrefused to run for re-election to Parliament because, he said, ``aninexperienced, non-political coterie'' of Gandhi aides would notlet have the district he wanted.   As if his political difficulties were not enough, Gandhi'sdentist revealed that the prime minister had a serious toothache.It came to light after Gandhi and several bodyguards were seenarriving at the dentist's clinic Monday.   Z.R. Ansary, the minister for environment and forests, wasaccused by Mukul Dutta, 26, an environmental activist from theHimalayan hills, of trying to molest her Oct. 9 in his office.   She told a New Delhi news conference 2{ weeks later that Ansarilunged at her, ``violently assaulting me in a most obscene anddegrading manner.''   Ansari, 64, called the charge a politically inspiredfabrication. ``Even an insane sex maniac should be credited withmore intelligence'' than to attack a woman in his own office withstaff members nearby, he said Saturday.   Defense Minister Krishna Chandra Pant said he wanted to run forParliament in Nainital, his home district in Uttar Pradesh, andwould not contest the New Delhi constituency to which he wasassigned.   ``The revival of state party bossism and the unwarrantedinterference of inexperienced non-political coteries in politicaldecision-making has been causing concern to all of us for sometime,'' Pant said in a letter to Gandhi.   His reference was to a group of Gandhi's old school friends whoare closely involved in the campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
