RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The public should be given greater access tocomplaints against federal judges, a task force appointed by aprivate research organization said Monday.   The group also recommended measures to protect people,particularly lawyers, who file complaints against the judges.   The task force of The Twentieth Century Fund said its proposalsare intended to strengthen a 1980 law authorizing the federaljudiciary to discipline its members for misconduct or disability.   ``Because the 1980 procedures call for self-policing of thejudiciary, their legitimacy has been questioned by some critics,''the task force said. ``The legitimacy of these reforms would beenhanced if an auditing mechanism were put into place.''   The group proposed creating a special committee appointed by theU.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federaljudiciary, to oversee complaints against judges.   The committee would include lawyers, scholars and members of thegeneral public and generally would be authorized to revealnow-confidential complaints against judges as long as the chargesare not frivolous.   The task force, headed by University of Pennsylvania law schoolprofessor A. Leo Levin, also said it favors protecting anyone whofiles a complaint against a judge by barring the judge from anysanction against the individual.   ``We were troubled by testimony we heard from practicingattorneys who voiced reticence about filing a complaint out ofconcern that doing so would jeopardize their clients or hindertheir careers,'' the task force said.   The task force report was prompted in part by recentcongressional impeachment and removal from office of three federaljudges: Alcee L. Hastings of Florida, Harry E. Claiborne of Nevadaand Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi.   Hastings was acquitted on charges of soliciting a bribe for afavorable decision from the bench. Claiborne was convicted ofincome tax evasion. Nixon was convicted of perjury.   The task force said impeachment and removal should remaindifficult in order to guarantee judicial independence. But it urgeda congressional study to determine whether the impeachment processshould be changed to promote greater accountability for judges.   The task force also said it frowns upon any ``conspiracy ofsilence'' that allows infirm judges to remain on the bench whenthey no longer are capable of doing the work.   ``It is particularly important that the chief judge (of eachrespective federal regional circuit) exercise the obligation toprompt such a judge to step down before formal procedures areinvoked,'' the task force said.   Besides Levin, the task force members are Rep. Barney Frank,D-Mass.; Abner Mikva, a federal appeals court judge here; NancyNeuman, president of the League of Women Voters; University ofSouthern California law school professor Judith Resnik; DorothyRidings, publisher of The Bradenton (Fla.) Herald; U.S. DistrictJudge Jack Weinstein of New York; author and NorthwesternUniversity professor Garry Wills, and Texas Tech University lawprofessor Thomas Baker.</TEXT></DOC>
