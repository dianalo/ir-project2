The state East German news agency ADN said the director, DietmarHildebrand, uncovered evidence of up to 62 executions.   Hildebrand, who took over as head of the Tolkewitz crematoriumsix months ago, said he got the information from records kept byhis predecessor.   East Germany's authoritarian Communist government was toppledlast fall.   The crematorium director's suspicions were aroused when recordsthat involved people who had supposedly died natural deaths alsocontained documents from the state prosecutor's office, the reportsaid.   ``With typical German efficiency, behind the name of each suchrecord, were the hand-printed letters `Po' in red ink, indicatingthey were political prisoners,'' ADN said. The prisoners' cause ofdeath was usually listed as heart failure, Hildebrand said.   Hildebrand sought out witnesses to the sentencing andexecutions, the report said. He said doctors familiar with theprisoners' fate told him the condemned were usually tied to a boardwithout a blindfold, placed under a guillotine and killed. Theywere later cremated.   The doctors were not identified in the report.   The executions were carried out in the Georg Schumann buildingof Dresden's Technical University, which was also used by the Nazisfor executions, the report said. It is now a memorial site to Nazivictims.   Hildebrand said he was going public with the information sothose involved in the executions could be brought to justice.   After East Germany's hard-line government was overthrown,relatives of some prisoners cremated at Tolkewitz asked about theirremains, ADN said.   Other relatives whose property was seized by the state aftertheir family members were sentenced as political prisoners are nowseeking reparations, the news agency said.   The list of names complied by Hildebrand starts with a man whodied on July 6, 1952, the agency said. It said the final listingwas Jan. 15, 1960.</TEXT></DOC>
