<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0129 </DOCNO><TEXT>The surface diffusion and initial stages of cluster nucleation of Pd adatomson Ta(110) are investigated by field ion microscopy (FIM). The resultsindicate that Pd atoms become mobile on Ta(110) at 180 K and diffusewith an activation energy of 0.49 +- 0.02 eV. The structure of smallPd clusters on the Ta(110) plane depends upon the number of Pd adatomspresent on the plane. If fewer than nine Pd atoms are deposited on theplane, the stable configuration is a linear chain oriented along a close-packeddirection of the substrate. Two-dimensional island clusters containingfewer than nine atoms are metastable. For nine or more adatoms, however,the stable configuration is a two-dimensional island cluster and thelinear chain cluster is metastable. Field ion images of the two-dimensionalisland clusters indicate that the Pd overlayer is pseudomorphic up to,and including, approximate monolayer coverages. Two-dimensional Pd clustersmigrate as a unit on Ta(110) at temperatures from {similar_to}250 to325 K. Above {similar_to}350 K the clusters rapidly disappear from theplane. The results of this investigation are compared to other FIM datarelated to the nucleation of metal-adatom clusters.</TEXT></DOC>
