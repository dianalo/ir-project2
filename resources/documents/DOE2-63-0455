Its function is to protect the major structuresaround the plenum separator structure from thermal loading. The objectivesof the present study are to get the natural convection heat transfercorrelation and to establish the analytical method for the predictionof the temperature profile in the intermediate plenum, which is characterizedby a thermal stratification. Natural convection heat transfer tests,using lead-bismuth alloy, conducted to evaluate the effect of thermalstratification on the liquid metal heat transfer rates. The enhancementof heat transfer rate by bulk fluid stratification is calculated forthermally stratified sodium. Effects of heat flow from the side wallsare evaluated on the heat transfer and temperature distribution in confinedmedia with a high degree of thermal stratification. Following stationarytests, transient tests simulating a reactor trip, in water and liquidmetal were conducted for the prupose of obtaining basic idea which regardsto the transient temperature profile after sudden cooling of a top roofof the intermediate plenum. A practical method is proposed to obtaina stable solution of natural convection at high Grash of number in thermallystratified fluid. From the present study, the analytical methods havebeen established for the prediction of the temperature profile in theintermediate plenum of a pool-type LMFBR.</TEXT></DOC>
