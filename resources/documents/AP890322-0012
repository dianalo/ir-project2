TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ten years after signing a treaty with Egypt thatended three decades of war, Israel has mixed feelings about thestunted peace with the largest and most powerful Arab state.   When President Anwar Sadat of Egypt broke the Arab taboo ondealing with Israel with his historic 1977 visit to Jerusalem, theevent stirred a euphoria in Israel unmatched since the founding ofthe Jewish state.   But there is now deep chagrin in Isrsael that the promise of suchpeacemaking did not lead to other peace treaties with Arab statesand that Egypt shunned close ties in trade and tourism.   ``Real peace is daily contacts in many fields like we see betweenEuropean states who a few years ago fought each other like eternalenemies, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said recently. ``We are stillfar from this.''   According to Israeli statistics, 63,000 Israeli tourists visitedEgypt last year and Israel exported $6 million in goods to Cairo.Egyptian tourism totaled only 100 people last year while Egyptianexports reached $2.5 million to $3 million, a diplomatic source inCairo said.   The clearest evidence of the undeveloped peace is the absence ofany celebrations in Jerusalem or Cairo to mark the March 26, 1979,signing of the treaty on the White House lawn.   However, the pact has survived Sadat's 1981 assassination, thekilling of seven Israeli tourists and an embassy employee in 1985,and cross-border raids by Palestinians, including one in 1988 inwhich three Israelis were killed.   Egypt showed no signs of wavering in upholding Sadat's pledgethat there would be ``no more wars'' despite Israel's 1981annexation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria, the 1982-85invasion of Lebanon and the ongoing Palestinian uprising that beganin December 1987.   After seven years of squabbling, Israel handed back to Egypt thedisputed beach resort of Taba this month without the die-hardopposition of Israeli right-wingers who fought the Sinai pullout in1982.   ``Will the treaty last another 10 years? I tell you I don't know,I can't be sure,'' said Eliahu Ben-Elissar, Israel's firstambassador to Cairo.   ``But I can assure you that today in Egypt I see no sign of anywill to go back to the past situation of war. That's something. Infact, it's immense,'' said Ben-Elissar, now a Parliament memberrepresenting the right-wing Likud Bloc.   Ezer Weizman, then defense minister for Likud and now scienceminister for the left-leaning Labor Party, said the biggestdisappointment was Israel's failure to follow up on the treaty.   ``I was hoping for a much better situation, especially regardingthe Palestinian problem,'' said Weizman, who quit the Cabinet toprotest the lack of progress in 1980 toward granting Palestiniansautonomy.   Peace with Egypt changed Weizman's world view completely. Theformer pilot and air force commander became one of Israel's leadingdoves and advocates talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.   ``It's a pity we lost 10 years, but it is better late thannever,'' said Weizman in an interview.   From Israel's point of view, the greatest benefit of the treatywas reducing the likelihood of an Arab coalition forming as it didin 1973 to launch a war against Israel.   ``There is no war with Egypt, and there's not going to be a war,and the peace from this point of view is a real peace,'' saidAvraham Tamir, a retired army general who negotiated the militaryaspects of Israel's withdrawal from Sinai.   ``The peace with Egypt was an historical achievement becausewithout this peace we would have passed at least one more war, andthere are no winners in these wars,'' Tamir said in an interview.   The peace treaty allowed Israel to scale down its arms race withthe Arab world and reduce the amount of time Israel'ssoldier-citizens spend in uniform.   But Ben-Elissar, a member of Parliament's foreign affairs anddefense committee, stressed in an interview at his Parliament officethat Israelis had not yet been convinced their war of survival wasover.   ``Israelis know that Egypt has recognized Israel as a reality,but this doesn't mean Egypt has recognized Israel's right to existas a nation,'' he said. ``Egyptians did not depart from what theArab world represents: a total negation of the rights of Jews tolive as an independent sovereign nation.''   Ben-Elissar, who was on the negotiating team that produced thetreaty with Egypt, said if warmer relations had evolved it couldhave melted the barriers to understanding.   ``We are still back in the pre-1977 myths and traumas. This ispeace, but it may be seen by some as a tactical peace'' in whichEgypt signed an agreement only to get back land, he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   NEXT: A report from Cairo on how Egypt is still keeping a waryeye on Israel despite the 10-year-old peace treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
