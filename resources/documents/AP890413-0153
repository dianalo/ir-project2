The legislation is aimed at thousands of Medicaid beneficiarieswho need help with their home routines, but whose sickness orfrailty is not severe enough to require them to enter a nursinghome.   The bill, designed to cut through red tape to make it easier forstates to pay for at least part of the cost of home care underMedicaid, was unveiled at a news conference by its author, Sen. JayRockefeller, D-W.Va. The co-sponsors are Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa.,Paul Simon, D-Ill., George Mitchell, D-Maine, Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,and David Pryor, D-Ark.   In 1981, the government approved interim regulations authorizingstates to get waivers to pay for home care under Medicaid, afederal program providing medical services to the needy.   The regulations specify that such care can be provided in thehomes using Medicaid funds only if it saves money over hospital ornursing home care.   The bill, estimated to cost $680 million over the first fiveyears, would end the waiver system and make home care services anoptional, statewide benefit.</TEXT></DOC>
