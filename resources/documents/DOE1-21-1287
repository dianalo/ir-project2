We review one- and two-electron-capturemethods using energetic neutral beams, and provide quantitative estimatesof signal level for a two-electron-capture method applicable to CIT.The best probe is a ground-state helium-atom beam because of its relativelygood penetration into a CIT plasma and the large cross section for two-electroncapture; it can be produced in useful quantities from HeH{sup +}. Wecalculate a signal level of the order of 10{sup 7} counts/s for 100 mAof accelerated HeH{sup +}, which is sufficient to allow time-resolvedmeasurements of the alpha-particle velocity distribution. Limited positioninformation could be obtained for appropriate access port geometry. Thisdiagnostic is feasible, and we recommend further research and developmentleading to implementation on CIT. 39 refs., 16 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
