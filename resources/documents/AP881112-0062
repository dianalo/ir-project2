SUAREZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The commander of the Communist rebelarmy escaped from prison Saturday after he was let out of his cellto attend a birthday party for the former prison warden, officialssaid.   A spokesman for the Philippine Constabulary, Lt. Col. CresencioMaralit, said the military flashed a nationwide alarm and sealed offapproaches to Manila after Romulo Kintanar and his wife, Gloria,fled about 3 p.m. from the home of Maj. Robelito Comilang.   Kintanar and his wife were arrested in March. The military saysKintanar is commander of the 25,000-strong New People's Army, whichhas been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state.   Kintanar was widely believed to be the chief organizer ofcommunist assassination squads responsible for killing scores ofpolice and soldiers. He is the third prominent government opponentto escape military custody.   Comilang, the former warden at the military stockade, invitedKitanar and other prisoners to his party at his home at Camp Crame.The prison is on the grounds of Camp Crame.   Maralit told reporters an investigation was under way becauseKintanar was a ``maximum security prisoner'' who should not havebeen allowed outside his cell without a guard.   Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao, senior officer on duty Saturday atCamp Crame, said Kintanar was released from his cell about noon andescorted to Comilang's home.   According to the report, Kintanar and the guard left the partyabout two hours later and returned to stockade. Later, Kintanar, hiswife and another rebel prisoner, Jorge Madlos, went back with thesame guard to Comilang's party.   Dumlao said that at about 3 p.m., Madlos asked to be taken backto the stockade. Constable Jimmy Acma walked Madlos back to his cellbut when he returned to the party, Kintanar and his wife were gone,Dumlao said.   Dumlao said several guards were arrested and Comilang and theacting prison commander, Maj. Benjamin Landrito, were detained.   The general gave no explanation why Kintanar returned to theparty a second time. Landrito said he did not not give permissionfor Kintanar to leave the cell the second time because ``I was in myoffice, sleeping.''   ``The only time I knew about the escape of Kintanar and his wifewas when they woke me up at 3:15,'' Landrito told The AssociatedPress in an interview late Saturday.   Comilang was temporarily relieved of his post as prisoncommandant pending an investigation into last month's killing of Lt.Col. Francisco Baula at the stockade.   Prison guards claimed Baula, a leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 coupattempt against President Corazon Aquino, was shot while trying toescape. His relatives claim he was murdered.   Kintanar and his wife were arrested in March in Manila along withRafael Baylosis, the alleged secretary-general of the outlawedCommunist Party of the Philippines.   The military hailed the arrests as a major blow to the rebelmovement.   The Camp Crame prison houses about 160 prisoners, including bothCommunist rebels and right-wing extremists jailed in connection withcoup attempts against the Aquino government.   Kintanar was the latest prominent opponent of the Aquinogovernment to escape military custody. In April, Lt. Col. GregorioHonasan, leader of the August coup attempt, escaped from a prisonship in Manila Bay with the help of his guards.   Honasan remains at large.   A few days later, a Honasan confederate, Lt. Col. EduardoMatillano, escaped after being allowed to leave his cell to visit adentist.   Matillano was arrested in September in Quezon City.</TEXT></DOC>
