Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from February 25 through March 10, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on March 8, 1989 (54 FR 9912). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By April 21, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket No. STN 50-528, PaloVerde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Unit 1, Maricopa County, Arizona</ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 12, l989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise the PVNGS Technical Specifications (TS) with respect to ShutdownMargin (Figure 3.1-1A and Tables 3.1-2, 3.1-3 and 3.1-5), Control ElementAssembly (CEA) Insertion Limits (Figures 3.1-3 and 3.1-4), Azimuthal PowerTilt Allowance (Figure 3.2-1A), and Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio(DNBR) Margin (Figures 3.2-2 and 3.2-2A) to maintain consistency betweenthe Technical Specifications and the safety analysis performed for theUnit 1, Cycle 3 core design. More specifically, the proposed changes regarding Shutdown Margin involvethe revision of TS Figure 3.1-1A and Tables 3.1-2, 3.1-3 and 3.1-5. Figure3.1-1A provides shutdown margin requirements versus RCS cold leg temperaturefor the case where any full-length CEA is withdrawn. Tables 3.1-2, 3.1-3and 3.1-5 provide required boron monitoring frequencies in the event thatone or both startup channel high neutron flux alarms are inoperable. Theproposed revisions are required to reflect cycle specific requirements.The revisions result in more restrictive operating limits. The proposed changes regarding Control Rod Insertion Limits would reviseTS Figures 3.1-3 and 3.1-4. These figures provide regulating group CEAinsertion limits. Figure 3.1-3 provides CEA insertion limits when the CoreOperating Limit Supervisory System (COLSS) is in service and Figure 3.1-4provides the insertion limits when COLSS is out of service. The followingtwo changes are proposed: (i) The proposed revised Figure 3.1-3 (COLSSin service) would not permit insertion of regulating group 3 CEAs above20 percent of rated thermal power. This is more restrictive than the currentspecification which does allow for regulating group 3 insertion above 20percent of rated thermal power. (ii) The proposed revised Figure 3.1-4(COLSS out of service) would permit slightly increased insertion of regulatinggroup 3 CEAs between 15 percent and 20 percent of rated thermal power.The proposed change regarding Azimuthal Power Tilt would revise TS Figure3.2-1A. This figure provides azimuthal power tilt limits versus core powerfor COLSS in service. The azimuthal power tilt allowance would be increasedfrom 10 percent for operation below 40 percent of rated thermal power.The proposed changes regarding DNBR margin would revise TS Figure 3.2-2and 3.2-2A. These figures provide DNBR margin limits for various configurationsof COLSS and CEA Calculators (CEACs) inoperable. The changes are necessaryto ensure that the Technical Specifications are consistent with the safetyanalyses performed for the Cycle 3 core design. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against these standardsand has provided the following discussion: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Shutdown Margin</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1</T3> _ Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed Technical Specifications changes are requiredto make the Technical Specifications consistent with the Cycle 3 safetyanalyses. Figure 3.1-1A provides shutdown margin requirements versus RCScold leg temperatures when any full-length CEA is withdrawn. For operationbelow a RCS cold leg temperature of 350 [degrees] F, the shutdown marginmust be increased from 3.5 to 4.0% delta K/K. This ensures that the consequencesof [design basis events] DBEs and AOOs [abnormal operating occurrences]remain bounded by the reference cycle....In conclusion, the proposed changesdo not affect the probability of occurrence of any previously analyzedevents. Additionally, the proposed changes ensure that the consequencesof previously analyzed events will be no greater than the reference cycle.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2</T3> _ Create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed changes to [TS] Figure 3.1-1A and Tables3.1-2, 3.1-3 and 3.1-5 are required to make the Technical Specificationsconsistent with the Cycle 3 safety analyses. The changes will not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously analyzed. The changes ensure that the results of DBEs and AOOsare bounded by the reference cycle analyses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3</T3> _ Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The bases section for Limiting Condition for Operation(LCO) 3.1.1.2 states that the shutdown margin limits of Figure 3.1-1A arenecessary to ensure that the reactor remains subcritical following a DBEor AOO. With the proposed change to Figure 3.1-1A, the Cycle 3 safety analysesensure that the results of DBEs and AOOs are bounded by the reference cycleanalyses. The bases section for LCO 3.1.2.7 states that the boron monitoringfrequencies ensure that boron dilution events will be detected with sufficienttime for the operator to terminate the event before complete loss of shutdownmargin. The revised monitoring frequencies of [TS] Tables 3.1-2, 3.1-3and 3.1-5 ensure that the time criteria for these actions will be consistentwith the reference cycle. Therefore, the margin of safety, as defined inthe bases sections of the Technical Specifications, will be maintained.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>CEA Insertion Limits</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1</T3> _ Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ TS Figures 3.1-3 and 3.1-4 will be updated to be consistentwith the Cycle 3 safety analyses. The probability and/or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated in the [Final Safety Analysis Report]FSAR will not increase because the results of the Cycle 3 safety analyses,using the revised CEA insertion limits of Figures 3.1-3 and 3.1-4, assurethat there is sufficient margin for the most limiting DBE. The analysesperformed include an evaluation of all safety analyses for which the CEAinsertion limit curves serve as an initial condition. Therefore, the proposedTechnical Specifications changes will not increase the probability or consequencesof any accidents previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2</T3> _ Create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed changes are required to make the TechnicalSpecifications consistent with Cycle 3 safety analyses. There have beenno hardware changes involving equipment important to safety as a resultof the proposed changes. Therefore, the possibility of an accident of adifferent type than any evaluated previously in FSAR will not be created.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3</T3> _ Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The changes to the transient insertion limit lines of[TS] Figures 3.1-3 and 3.1-4 are required to make the Technical specificationsconsistent with the Cycle 3 safety analyses. Operation of the reactor inaccordance with the revised transient insertion limits will ensure thatthe Specified Acceptable Fuel Design Limits (SAFDLs) are not exceeded duringthe most limiting Anticipated Operational Occurrence (AOO). The Cycle 3limits are based on the same design criteria as the Cycle 2 limits. Therefore,the margin of safety will not be reduced as a result of the proposed changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Azimuthal Power Tilt</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1</T3> _ Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedsince the results of the Unit 1, Cycle 3 analyses incorporate the higherazimuthal tilt values at low power (with COLSS in service). This assuresthat there is sufficient margin in the safety analyses for the most limitingDBE. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Physics calculations were performed to verify that the results ofthe Cycle 3 analysis, using the azimuthal power tilt limits proposed inFigure 3.2-1A with COLSS in service, were bounded by the reference cycleanalysis. In particular, all events which use an explicit value for azimuthalpower tilt in the calculation (i.e., the CEA ejection, single full lengthCEA withdrawal, and single part length CEA drop events) were reanalyzedwith the new higher azimuthal power tilt limits. For the remaining DBEs,there is sufficient conservatism in the assumptions made for the initialconditions (from which the events are started) to account for the increasedazimuthal power tilt allowed by the proposed Technical Specification changebelow 40% power. Above 40% power, the proposed figure is identical to thereference cycle and is therefore bounded by that analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2</T3> _ Create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed change will not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.The proposed Technical Specification amendment only changes the azimuthalpower tilt limits at low power levels (below 40% power), and does not modifyany plant equipment or operating procedures. The relaxation of the azimuthalpower tilt limit for Unit 1 allows the operators to better mitigate xenontransients below 40% power. Therefore, the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident will not be created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3</T3> _ Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed change will not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety since the results of the analyses assuming the higherazimuthal tilt values assure that there is sufficient margin for the mostlimiting DBE. Therefore, the margin of safety will not be reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>DNBR Margin</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1</T3> _ Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Basis</T3> _ The proposed revisions to Technical Specification Figures3.2-2 and 3.2-2A will not increase the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated. Figures 3.2-2 and 3.2-2A must be updatedto be consistent with Cycle 3 safety analyses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The Cycle 3 safety analyses have shown that when COLSS is in serviceand at least one CEAC is operable, Technical Specification 3.2.4a providesadequate margin to DNB to accommodate the most limiting AOO without violatingthe SAFDLs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The proposed revision to [TS] Figure 3.2-2 accounts for the situationwhere COLSS is out of service and at least one CEAC is operable. In thiscase the Cycle 3 safety analyses have shown that by maintaining the [CoreProtection Calculator] CPC calculated DNBR above the value shown in therevised figure, the limiting AOO will not result in a violation of theSAFDLs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

TheCycle 3 figures were based on the same design criteria as the Cycle 2 figures.Therefore, the margin of safety will not be reduced as a result of theproposed changes. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards analysis andconcurs with their conclusions. As such, we propose to determine that therequested changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Phoenix Public Library, Businessand Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. <T3>Attorney for licensees: </T3>Mr. Arthur C.

The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on December 2, 1986, as supplementedon November 17, 1987, October 12, 1988 and January 24, 1989, to satisfythe requirements of the amended regulations. The Commission proposes toamend the license to reference the revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significanthazards consideration is example (vii) ``a change to conform a licenseto changes in the regulations, where the license change results in veryminor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.''The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example. For theforegoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposedamendment involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

Three service water system pumps with their associated piping and valveswould be required operable on the designated essential header when thereactor is above 350anddegrees; F as opposed to the current requirement ofthree pumps with associated piping and valves being required operable whenthe reactor is critical. 2. The current allowable-out-of-service time of 8 hours for one of thethree service water pumps on the designated essential header or any ofthe associated piping or valves would be changed to 12 hours. A requirementwould also be added for the reactor to be in hot shutdown within the next6 hours and in cold shutdown within the next 30 hours if the service watersystem is not restored to operable status during the allowable-out-of-servicetime. The current technical specification does not provide a time limitfor achieving cold shutdown. 3. A Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) requiring the operability oftwo service water pumps with associated piping and valves on the designatednon-essential header when the reactor is above 350anddegrees; F would beadded. Provisions would also be added specifying that with one of thesetwo pumps or any of the associated piping or valves inoperable, both pumpsand the associated piping and valves shall be restored to operable statuswithin 24 hours or the reactor shall be in hot shutdown within the next6 hours and in cold shutdown within the next 30 hours. 4. A LCO would be added specifying the isolation requirements between theessential and non-essential headers of the service water system. Isolationbetween these two headers would be required at all times when the reactoris above 350anddegrees; F except for periods of up to 8 hours when the headersmay be connected to facilitate safety-related activities. The current technicalspecification does not require isolation between the essential and non-essentialheaders. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposedTechnical Specification changes are deemed to involve no significant hazardsconsiderations because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordancewith this change would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change to require three designated essential servicewater pumps be operable when the reactor is above 350anddegrees; F is morerestrictive than the existing Technical Specification requirement of operabilityprior to criticality. This change is consistent with previous accidentanalyses and supports a current administrative requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Concerning the proposed increase in designated essential service waterpump out-of-service time, the inoperability of a service water pump, nomatter how long the outage time, has no relationship to the probabilityof an accident occurring. Once an accident occurs, the increased time couldaffect the consequences of the accident. However, since alternate systemsfor the components supplied by the essential service water system are availableand are not themselves supplied by the essential service water system,this is unlikely. Additionally, by increasing the service water pump out-of-servicetime, on-line maintenance could more readily be performed, which shouldenhance overall pump and system availability and reduce cycling of theunit. Thus, the same safety criteria as previously evaluated are stillmet with the proposed change. The allowance of an additional 4 hours out-of-servicetime for the essential service water pumps is still more restrictive thanthe allowed out-of-service times for the components it serves, such asfan cooler-charcoal filter units (FCUs). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The addition of a time period to attain hot shutdown and the establishmentof a time period for attaining cold shutdown if the designated essentialservice water pump LCO cannot be satisfied are new requirements. CurrentTechnical Specifications require placing the reactor in cold shutdown anda time period is not specified. The proposed 6 hour time period to achievehot shutdown and the 30 hour time period to attain cold shutdown are consistentwith the times actually required to achieve these modes in a controlledmanner, and, are not unlike the requirement imposed for similar systemsout-of-service in excess of their LCO by existing Technical Specification3.0.1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">One of proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.3.F (ServiceWater System) adds the requirement for two service water pumps on the designatednon-essential header, together with their associated piping and valves,to be operable when the reactor is above 350anddegrees; F. During the recirculationphase of a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), one component cooling water(CCW) pump is required to provide minimum safeguards. As discussed in theBasis for Technical Specification 3.3 and in Section 9.6.1.2 of the FSAR,one service water pump on the non-essential header is required to supplythe minimum cooling water requirements for the CCW system. This changemerely adds a LCO to ensure the availability of one non-essential servicewater pump to fulfill its function during a LOCA. A minimum of two servicewater pumps are required to be operable to satisfy single failure criteria.A 24 hour out-of-service time with only one non-essential pump operableis acceptable since the safety-related equipment it serves, the componentcooling water pumps, are allowed the same outage time by Technical Specification3.3.E. The proposed 36 hour time period, 6 hours to achieve hot shutdownand 30 hours to achieve cold shutdown if the LCO cannot be satisfied, isconsistent with the time required to attain these modes in a controlledmanner. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,but supports the requirements of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Header interconnection is allowed under the current specificationand is only addressed separately in the new format for this specification.Since no change to the system or its operation is involved, there is noimpact on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the operability requirements for the designatedessential service water pumps (extension of allowed outage time, operabilityrequired prior to 350anddegrees; F, 36 hours to attain cold shutdown) donot alter plant configuration or operation from that assumed in currentanalyses which bound those for IP-2.

Since heat removal requirements lessenas reactor coolant temperature decreases, the change will increase marginof safety with regard to heat removal ability. Adding a time period toattain hot shutdown and imposing a definite time limit for attaining coldshutdown when the LCO cannot be met are also more restrictive than theexisting requirement and will also increase margin of safety with regardto improving the ability to remove heat. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The service water system is comprised of six pumps that supply twoseparate headers, each header being supplied by three pumps. Either ofthe headers can be designated to supply the essential loads, those whichmust have an assured supply of cooling water in the event of a loss ofoffsite power and/or loss-of-coolant accident, and the essential loadscan be transferred to the non-essential header and vice versa by manualvalve operation. This ability to exchange headers results in an alternateessential service water system, in most instances. Also, the safety functionof the designated essential service water pumps is to supply cooling waterto the FCUs, the FCU motor coolers and the Emergency Diesel Generators(EDGs). Current Technical Specifications on these equipment allow out-of-servicetimes of 7 days for an inoperable component, provided alternate systemsare operable. The alternate system for the FCUs are the containment spraypumps, and the 138 kv and 13.8 kv sources of offsite power are alternatesupplies for the EDGs. These alternate systems do not require service watercooling. Therefore, due to the existence of these alternate systems andcomponents, which would serve to mitigate the temporary inoperability ofa pump, there is not a significant reduction in a margin of safety to increasethe out-of-service time from 8 hours to 12 hours for an essential servicewater pump. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Previous accident analyses require non-essential service water tosupply the component cooling heat exchangers. The proposed addition ofan non-essential service water pump LCO in accordance with the design basisas described in the FSAR does not reduce nor change any margin of safetyfrom those existing now. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Placing the existing requirement for interconnection of the essentialand non-essential headers in a separate subsection of the service waterspecification has no impact on a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards for determining whether ``Significant Hazards Considerations''exist by providing examples in 51 FR 7751. Example (ii) of the Commission'sExamples of Amendments That Are Considered Not Likely To Involve SignificantHazards Considerations relates to ``a change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the TechnicalSpecifications.'' In this case, the proposed changes to include a non-essentialservice water header LCO, to require essential service water header operabilityprior to 350anddegrees; F, and, to add a time period to attain hot shutdownand to impose a time limit to attain cold shutdown when the essential servicewater header LCO is not satisfied, are similar to Example (ii) since thelimitations are not currently in the Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example (iii) of the Commission's Examples of Amendments That AreConsidered Likely To Involve Significant Hazards Considerations relatesto a change that involves ``a significant relaxation in limiting conditionsfor operation not accompanied by compensatory changes, conditions, or actionsthat maintain a commensurate level of safety...''. As discussed under requirement3 above, the relaxation in the essential service water header LCO to allowthe inoperability of one pump for 12 hours instead of the current 8 hoursis amply compensated for by the existence of alternate systems and components.Therefore, this change will not involve any ``Significant Hazards Considerations''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, since the application for amendment satisfies the criteriaspecified in 10 CFR 50.92, is similar to examples for which ``No SignificantHazards Considerations'' exist, and does not meet the criteria for examplesfor which ``Significant Hazards Considerations'' exist, the licensee hasdetermined the application involves ``No Significant Hazards Considerations''.</ITAG>The staff does not fully agree with some of the details of the licensee'sanalysis as it applies to the new LCO dealing with the interconnectionof headers. The staff agrees that the existing technical specificationspermit interconnection of the essential and non-essential headers. However,the proposed amendment would add an LCO requiring the essential headerbe isolated from the non-essential header at all times when the reactoris above 350anddegrees; F except for a period of up to 8 hours when the headersmay be connected to facilitate safety-related activities. The additionof this new LCO constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or controlnot presently in the technical specifications rather than simply havingisolation of these headers addressed separately in a new format for thisspecification. The staff notes that the addition of this LCO matches example(ii) of the Commission's Example of Amendments that Are Considered NotLikely To Involve Significant Hazards Considerations. Therefore, basedon the licensee's analysis as supplemented by the staff's analysis foradding the LCO dealing with the interconnection of headers, the staff proposesthat the proposed amendment will not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>White Plains Public Liberty,100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York, 10610. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Brent L.

The July 25, 1986 submittal was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 13, 1986 (51 FR 29023) <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment changesTechnical Specification 3.5.A.3 and 4.5 regarding containment integratedleak rate testing to reflect compliance with Appendix J to 10 CFR 50. Specificallythe major changes are as follows: <T3>Section 3.5.A</T3> - The licensee has added step 3.4.A.3.b to 3.5.A.3to create an additional limiting condition for operation (LCO) concerningdrywell operability per TS Section 4.5.E. <T3>Section 4.5</T3> - The licensee has modified the applicability andobjectives paragraphs to list the major system surveillances and testsdescribed in this section and to refer to Appendix J of 10 CFR 50 for containmentleakage valves. <T3>Section 4.5.A - Type A Primary Containment Integrated Leak Rate Test(PCILRT)</T3> - The licensee has deleted pre-operational testing from Step1 as it applies to initial (pre-startup) testing of the containment. Thelicensee has also modified Step 2 and 3. Part of Step 2 and Step 3 aremoved to Section 4.5.C. Step 4 has remained essentially intact and renumberedas Step 2. <T3>Section 4.5.B Acceptance Criteria</T3> - Step 1 for maximum allowableleak rate remains essentially unchanged with minor subscript changes toparallel variables used in Appendix J. Step 2 and Step 3 are modified toreflect the applicable standard. The licensee has added Step 4 to establish an acceptance criteria for verificationtest in accordance with Section III.A.3(b) of Appendix J. <T3>Section 4.5.C Corrective Action</T3> - The licensee has changed thissection to give detailed options as to what may be done to limit leakageduring the PCILRT. Step 1.a allows for repairs and local testing of therepairs. It also allows for the recommencement of the PCILRT without therequired stabilization period if the containment was not depressurized.Step 1.b is essentially unchanged. Step 2 is deleted. <T3>Section 4.5.D Frequency</T3> - The licensee has deleted the first sectionconcerning testing during the first refueling as no longer relevant. Theremainder of this section is modified to reflect the testing frequencyof three times within each ten year service period as imposed by AppendixJ, Section III.D.1(a) and for two consecutive periodic Type A tests asimposed by Section III.A.6(b). <T3>Section 4.5.E-Type ``B'' and ``C'' Local Leak Rate Tests (LLRT)</T3>- Steps 1, 3 and 4 are taken apart and rearranged as Steps 1 through 4with the addition of a requirement to use normal valve closures. The licensee has rearranged Step 2 and Step 5 and expanded it to defineoperability of the drywell airlock. <T3>4.5.F Acceptance Criteria</T3> - The heading of this section is changedfrom ``Corrective Action'' to ``Acceptance Criteria''. Step 1 establishes the acceptance limits of combined leakage rate of potentialflow paths subject to type B and type C tests according to Appendix J,Section III.B.3 and C.3. Step 2 maintains the established leakage rate limits for MSIVs at OysterCreek. Step 3 establishes the acceptance limit of drywell airlock leakage notto exceed 5% of the allowable leakage rate (1a) as measured or adjustedto Pa. Step 4 includes the approved method for adjusting the drywell airlock leakagerate when tested at 10 psig per staff evaluation dated March 4, 1982 pursuantto PER-C5257-36 ``Containment Leakage Rate Testing''. <T3>Section 4.5.G Frequency</T3> - The original specification 4.5.G ismoved to 4.5.H. The licensee has added new specification 4.5.G which statesthat the local leak rate tests shall in no case exceed an interval of 24months. <T3>Section 4.5.H, I, J, K and L</T3> - The licensee has renumbered 4.5.G,H, I, J, and K in the present specification to 4.5.H, I, J, K and L inthe proposed specification. Present specification L which shows deletedis omitted in the proposed revision. The licensee has also corrected sometypographical errors in Sections 4.5.5.4.b, 4.5.5.5.b(3) and 4.5.Q.1.a.<T3>Section 4.5. Basis</T3> - The licensee has revised Section 4.5 basisto eliminate reference to the preoperational containment test pressuresas no longer applicable. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthe standards of 10 CFR 50.92 for determining whether a significant hazardsconsideration exists by providing certain examples as discussed in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 6, 1986 (51 FR 7751) under the heading``Examples of Amendment That Are Considered Not Likely to Involve SignificantHazards Considerations.'' Example (i) relates to a purely administrativechange to Technical Specifications: i.e., a change to achieve consistencythroughout the Technical Specifications, correction of an error, or a changein nonenclature. Example (ii) relates to a change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the TechnicalSpecifications; i.e., a more stringent surveillance requirement. Example(vii) relates to a change to make a license conform to changes in the regulations,when the license change results in very minor changes to facility operationsclearly in keeping with the regulations. In this case, each component of the proposed change described above issimilar to at least one of the three examples. The change in the numberingscheme is clearly an administrative change as described in example (i).The addition of Specification 3.5.A.3b is consistent with both examples(ii) and (vii). The modifications and additions made to Specifications4.5.A through 4.5.G also relate easily to example (ii) in that a more stringentand comprehensive surveillance requirement is established. Example (vii)also relates in that the surveillance program, in the form presented inthis proposal, is defined by a regulation to which the licensee is conformingto by the proposed amendment. In addition, proposed modification to the Technical Specifications willnot involve a significant hazards consideration because operation of OysterCreek Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with this change would not:(1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. This change merely redefines the leakrate testing program for Primary Containment. This program is designedto ensure that the Primary Containment is able to perform its design function.That function is to contain the energy and the radioactive release of thedesign basis loss of coolant accident. Therefore, this change cannot increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed. It has been determined that, because this revisionmore clearly establishes the requirements and methods of testing the PrimaryContainment integrity and does not involve a change to the containmentconfiguration, this change will not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any previously evaluated. (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This changehas increased the requirements as established in Appendix J that the primarycontainment must meet to be considered operable. Therefore, this changewill not reduce the margin of safety. This change reflects the requirements of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Ocean County Library, ReferenceDepartment, 101 Washington Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Ernest L.

Between these two power levels thecurrent limit is a constant 0.5E-4 delta rho per anddegrees; F. The requestedlimit is a line from 0.6E-4 delta rho per anddegrees; F at 0% power to thecurrent limit of 0.5 E-4 delta rho per anddegrees; F at 30% power. The MTClimit above 30% power is unchanged. Operation with a positive MTC occurs from initial core power escalationconditions up to approximately 50% power at Beginning of Cycle (BOC) conditionsonly. Historically, positive MTC operation at Maine Yankee has been minimal,averaging less than ten days per cycle or six and one half days per year.The history of measured MTCs at BOC for the limiting Hot-Zero-Power (HZP)condition is shown in Figure 2 relative to the proposed Technical Specificationlimit at HZP. The MTC at other times of the operating cycle has been shownto be non-limiting. There has been no noticeable trend towards more positiveMTC in recent cycles, and none is planned with the current (and projected)18-month, three-batch fuel management. The proposed change provides additional refueling outage schedule flexibilitywithout the need for rodded operation to meet MTC limits. Rodded core powerescalation is undesirable since: <ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Control rods are reserved primarily for symmetric offsetcontrol, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Rodded operation results in higher power peaking, and, therefore,lower power escalation rates, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Rod motion results in large local power density changes whichcan lead to fuel failures in fuel which is not preconditioned. </ITAG>The proposed change will provide additional refueling outage schedule flexibilitywithout the need for rodded operation to meet MTC limits.

This proposed change does not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. Operation of the plant with a more positiveallowable MTC between 0% and 30% power does not increase the probabilityof any FSAR event previously analyzed. The increase in MTC between 0% and30% power has an insignificant effect on the CEA Ejection analysis at zeropower, causing a minor increase in the peak radial average fuel enthalpypredicted. Fuel failures are not predicted to occur during this transient.All other analyses are unaffected by the change. Operation in the powerlevel range covered by this proposed change has historically been onlysix and one half days per year. Because Maine Yankee has demonstrated aminimization of operation in the region influenced by the proposed change,the probability of an accident occurring during this time has not changed.Therefore, the proposed change does not increase the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. Increasing the allowable MTC between 0% and 30% powerdoes not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any events previous evaluated. The change simply allows additionalearly shutdown flexibility at the end of each operating cycle. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Increasing theallowable MTC between 0% and 30% power does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety for any event. The margin of safety for the CEA ejectionevent will not be reduced since the predicted radiological releases remainbelow the limits imposed by 10 CFR Part 100. With the proposed change ineffect, the calculated margin to the peak radial average fuel enthalpythreshold of 200 cal/gm is well below the threshold. This margin is sufficientto ensure that the limits of 10 CFR Part 100 will not be violated. As statedabove, the only effect of this proposed change is an insignificant impacton the CEA Ejection analysis results at zero power, resulting in a minorincrease in the peak radial average fuel enthalpy predicted; however, nofuel damage is predicted. Therefore, the proposed change does not involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Commission has concluded that the proposed changes to the TechnicalSpecifications do not involve a significant hazards consideration as definedby 10 CFR 50.92. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Wiscasset Public Library,High Street, P.

The NRC determined,in the July 7, 1988 Safety Evaluation, that the Maine Yankee ICCI Systemcomplies with the requirements of Item II.F.2 of NUREG-0737. This proposedchange adds two ICCI subsystems - the Primary Inventory Trend System (PITS)and the Core Exit Thermocouple (CET) System - to the Technical Specificationsas required by NUREG-0737. The third ICCI subsystem - the Saturation MartinMonitor (SMM), is already included in the Technical Specifications. Theupgrade to the PITS was completed during the October-December 1988 refuelingoutage. Two minor editorial changes are also proposed in Tables 3.9-3 and 4.1-3of the Technical Specifications: (1) ``Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate'' has been changed to ``Emergency FeedwaterFlow Rate'' to reflect proper system nomenclature. (2) ``Reactor Coolant System Subcooling Margin Monitor'' has been changedto ``Reactor Coolant System Saturation Margin Monitor'' for consistencywith design basis documents. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration: </T3>The licenseehas submitted the following no significant hazards consideration: The proposed changes described herein have been evaluated against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and it has been determined that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significanthazards consideration. These proposed changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The PITS is designed to indicate collapsed liquid level in the reactorvessel during a small break incident after the reactor coolant pumps (RCPs)are shut off. The PITS provides no automatic actuation or control functionsand, therefore, will not impact the probability of previously analyzedaccidents. Incorporation of the PITS into the Technical Specificationsmay decrease the consequences of certain accidents previously analyzedby implementing instrumentation designed to provide additional informationto the operator to detect the approach and to aid in the response to inadequatecore cooling conditions. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously evaluated. The proposed change involves specifying the operability and surveillancerequirements for existing and redesigned accident monitoring instrumentationand, therefore, does not create the possibility of any new or differentkind of accident. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Inclusion of operability and surveillance requirements for PITS and CETSin the Technical Specifications may increase the margin of safety by providingreasonable assurance that the instrumentation available to be used by operatorsin responding to and assessing recovery actions to certain accidents andabnormal conditions are periodically maintained and operable for specifiedoperating modes. The licensee has concluded that the proposed changes to the Technical Specificationsdo not involve a significant hazards consideration as defined by 10 CFR50.92.

In accordancewith 10 CFR 50.92 the licensee has reviewed the proposed changes and hasconcluded as follows that they do not involve a significant hazards consideration:<ITAG tagnum="21">Significant Hazards Consideration Evaluation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change to the (Hope Creek Generating Station) HCGS TechnicalSpecifications: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The primary issue of concern is the ability of both the A and D EDGsto remain operational during the period of time beyond the current expirationdate for the 18 month overhaul, August 19 and August 27, 1989 respectively,and the requested extension date, October 15, 1989. As discussed in theOperational History section above, this period of time represents onlya 4 hour increase per diesel in the total operational hours that are projectedto accrue through August 1989. These increases are minimal when comparedto the total surveillance interval, the expected operational hours andthe operational hours accumulated during the first test cycle. Similarconclusions have been reached throughout the industry for extensions whichequal, or exceed in length, the one proposed for HCGS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to rezeroing the consecutive interval ``clock'', the overhaul/inspectionof the EDGs ensures that the manufacturer's specifications are met andreturns the EDGs to service in ``as good as new'' condition. Hence thelengths of previous surveillance intervals have little impact of the futurereliability of the EDG. Furthermore, since the amount of run time duringthe 18 month fuel cycle is small, wear failures have a very low probabilityof occurrence. Therefore, reinitializing the 18 month surveillance intervalto zero for each of the EDGs will have an equally minimal impact on EDGreliability or operability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result it can be concluded that the proposed change does notjeopardize the operability or reliability of the EDGs. Therefore, the requestedA and D EDG surveillance interval extension and the reinitialization ofthe accrued combined time interval (per TS 4.0.2.b) to zero for all EDGsdo not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change does not remove, modify or add any new equipment,components or systems. In addition, the proposed change does not alteror revise any procedure or operational aspect nor does it involve any newmode of plant operation associated with the diesels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, since the performance of the last 18 month overhaul,no new loads have been added which would jeopardize the operability ofthe diesels. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed change doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deferral of surveillance testing and inspection for the requestedtwo month period will not increase the possibility of undetected degradationof the diesels because of their infrequent operation and short run times.Since the total operational time of the diesels is very small, the probabilityof mechanical wear related failure is also very small. Testing and inspectioncan increase levels of confidence regarding the reliability of a componentor system, and to some extent increase the adequacy of safety margins.Performance of the tear-down inspection and capability/endurance testingtwice in the short interval described in the foregoing sections can, onthe other hand, have a negative impact on the service life and overallreliability of the EDGs and ECCS equipment which would be challenged. Theaffected EDGs' reliability has been demonstrated through their excellentperformance history and an insignificant number of start failures as comparedto total starts. In addition, the Limiting Conditions For Operation andSurveillance Test Requirements such as those contained in TS 4.8.1.1.2.a,regarding the monthly start, load and run, assures that the EDGs are operableand capable of supporting station operation when called upon to do so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, since each overhaul/inspection of the EDGs ensures restorationto manufacturer's specifications, the lengths of any prior surveillanceintervals have little impact on the future reliability of the EDG. Therefore,the reinitializing of the 18 month interval to zero (0) for the EDGs willhave an equally minimal impact on their reliability or operability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above it can be concluded that the proposed changes donot involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed licenseamendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees withthe licensee's analyses.

The proposed charges are to revise thesurveillance requirement (SR) 4.7.1.2.a to add specific, differential pressuretest values for each auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump. The associated basessection is revised to clarify the AFW technical specification requirements.The proposed changes for the Unit 2 TS supersede the values submitted inTVA's letter dated May 26, 1988 for TS change number 88-02. The new higherproposed differential pressure values for Unit 2 are to provide additionalmargin to offset uncertainties in the flow and pressure test data for theAFW pump. A revised bases for Unit 2 is also submitted. A notice of considerationof issuance of an amendment for TS 88-02 was issued for Unit 2 in the FederalRegister (53 FR 24522) on June 29, 1988. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information on the proposed TS changesin its submittal: <ITAG tagnum="21">By letter dated June 26, 1987, TVA provided information to NRC thatdetailed the need for a revision to the differential pressure test valuesspecified in SR 4.7.1.2.a. The revision to the motor-driven (MD) AFW pumpdifferential pressure test values is necessary because of the replacementof MD pump discharge, pressure control valves (PCVs) with cavitating venturis.This modification increased the system resistance of the MDAFW flow pathsand thus increased the differential pressure developed by the MDAFW pumpsnecessary to provide adequate flow to the steam generators. In this letter,TVA indicated that testing would be performed during unit 2 heatup to regenerateas necessary the system resistance curves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In a September 24, 1987 letter to NRC, additional information wasprovided on the issue of MDAFW pump operability. This letter indicatedthat the element of the 2A-A MDAFW pump had been replaced to increase availablemargin. Because of the replacement of the pump's element, a new pump curvewas required for the 2A-A MDAFW pump. This letter detailed how the newpump curve would be used in conjunction with the system resistance curvesto establish the new SR differential pressure test values. A safety evaluationreport (SER) dated November 2, 1987, was received from NRC that providedNRC concurrence with TVA's methodology for developing the new SR test values.The revisions to the MDAFW pump differential pressure test values are madebased on calculations generated from the test data accumulated during unit2 heatup. This is in accordance with the commitments made in the two TVAletters and recognized in the NRC SER. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the result of a revised pump curve and more conservative assumptionsin calculations the necessary head to ensure adequate flow to the steamgenerator, a revision is being made to the differential pressure test valueof the turbine-driven (TD) AFW pump. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To provide clarification of the AFW technical specification requirements,a revision to the bases is being made and is included for information.</ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has provided the followinganalysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification change andhas determined that it does not represent a significant hazards considerationbased on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordancewith the proposed amendment will not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. As described in section 10.4.7.2 ofthe SQN FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report], the AFW system is an engineeredsafety features system designed, constructed, and operated to serve asa backup to the main feedwater system to provide feedwater to the steamgenerator in the event that main feedwater is not available. This maintainsthe heat sink capabilities of the steam generators. The AFW system is directlyrelied upon to prevent core damage and system overpressurization in theevent of transients, such as a loss of normal feedwater or a secondarysystem pipe rupture, and to provide a means for plant cooldown followingany plant transient. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change to SR 4.7.1.2.a adds pump-specific, differentialpressure test values for each AFW pump. The new test values ensure thateach AFW pump will provide a flow of at least 440 gal/min plus pump recirculationflow. This flow satisfies the FSAR assumptions concerning 440 gal/min AFWflow to two intact steam generators. The addition of pump-specific testvalues merely reflects the performance characteristics of different pumps.Because the revised SR ensures conformance with the FSAR accident analysisassumptions, the probability or consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated remain unchanged. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. As described above, the proposed technicalspecification change to SR 4.7.1.2.a adds pump-specific, differential pressurerequirements for the testing of the AFW system. The revised requirementsensure that the AFW pumps will satisfy the assumptions of the FSAR AFWanalyses. No changes, other than those to the testing values, are madeto the AFW system. As such, the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any previously analyzed is not created by this change.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedchanges to SR 4.7.1.2.a add pump-specific, differential pressure test valuesfor each AFW pump. The new test values ensure that each AFW pump will providea flow of at least 440 gal/min plus recirculation flow.

Because operation remainsbounded by the FSAR analyses, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.</ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The first change is that the Director, Perry Plant TechnicalDepartment (PPTD), is being added to the membership of the Plant OperationsReview Committee (PORC) in lieu of the Technical Superintendent, PPTD.The second change is the additional reference that Security Plan changesand Security Plan Implementing Instruction changes will be approved bythe Director, Nuclear Support Department, vice the Director, PPTD. Thischange is a result of a recent reorganization of the site staff. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has previously made a proposed determination that theamendment involves no significant hazards considerations. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that the operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The changes proposed by the July 21 revision tothe license amendment request would add a more senior member to the PORCthan was previously proposed. The functions of the PORC and its membersremain the same. The changes also involve moving the functional responsibilityfor reviews of the Security Plan and the Security Plan Implementing Instructionsfrom the PPTD to the newly-formed Nuclear Support Department. The scopeof the reviews conducted remains unchanged. The Commission has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standardsas required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and has determined that: a. The proposed changes would not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated becausethe changes are administrative in nature and would not modify any accidentconditions or assumptions. The proposed changes continue to meet the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.36 by providing for the organization and management to ensuresafe operation of the facility. b. The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As stated above,the proposed changes are administrative in nature. The composition of thePORC is strengthened over that previously proposed and the function ofthe PORC remains the same. The Security Plan and Security Plan ImplementingInstruction changes reviews will continue to be conducted as before butonly under the responsibility of a different organizational entity. c. The changes would not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety because the changes would not affect systems, trains or componentsimportant to safety for the facility. The changes are administrative innature and involve only the designation of review responsibility withinthe organization and do not change the manner or conduct of these reviews.Therefore, the Commission proposes to determine that the changes do notinvolve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Perry Public Library, 3753Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay Silberg, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Pottsandamp; Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John N.

Change A modifies the Technical Specifications to add limiting conditionsof operation and surveillance requirements for the RCIC System resultingfrom requested improvements in NUREG-0737 for Items II.K.3.13 and II.K.3.22,which suggested that the design of the RCIC System should be modified suchthat: 1. The system would restart on subsequent low water level after it hasbeen terminated by a high water level signal; 2. RCIC System suction would automatically switchover from the condensatestorage tank to the suppression pool when the condensate storage tank levelis low. Change B removes the ``High Reactor Vessel Water Level'' trip functionfrom the tables which specify limiting conditions for operation and surveillancerequirements for HPCI System and RCIC System isolation instrumentationbecause it is not now located in the proper portion of the TS. The changewould include these limiting conditions of operation requirements for the``High Reactor Vessel Water Level'' trip function with the RCIC Systemactuation instrumentation and to include the surveillance requirementswith the RCIC and HPCI actuation instrumentation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Change A</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The incorporation of existing procedural controls for RCIC actuationwithin the Technical Specifications does not result in any system hardwaremodification or new plant configuration for operation. In addition, thereis no impact on any FSAR safety analysis involving the RCIC System. Furthermore,this proposed change does not alter the design basis, protective functions,or redundancy of the original system. Therefore, it is concluded that thereis not a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The incorporation of existing procedural controls for RCIC actuationwithin the Technical Specifications does not reduce the operation of theRCIC System from existing requirements and it is still bounded by the assumptionsused in the safety analysis. The proposed change does not result in anychange in Technical Specification setpoints, plant operation, protectivefunction, or design basis of the plant. In addition, the proposed changerepresents the incorporation of NUREG-0737 requirements to produce TechnicalSpecifications for RCIC restart and suction. Therefore, it is concludedthat the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The incorporation of existing procedural controls for RCIC actuationwithin the Technical Specifications does not affect any existing safetymargins. The proposed change actually represents an increase in safetybecause it will provide additional assurance that RCIC System operationis maintained within the limits determined to be acceptable. Physically,RCIC System operation will not change as a result of this proposed change.Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Change B</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Moving the Technical Specifications for the ``High Reactor VesselWater Level'' trip function from the HPCI System and RCIC System isolationinstrumentation tables and the addition of this trip function to the HPCISystem actuation instrumentation surveillance table does not result inany system hardware modification or new plant configuration for operation.In addition, there is no impact on any FSAR safety analysis involving theHPCI or RCIC Systems. Furthermore, this proposed change does not alterthe design basis, protective functions, or redundancy of the original systems.Limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements pertainingto the ``High Reactor Vessel Water Level'' trip function will still beaddressed in the Technical Specifications under RCIC and HPCI Systems actuation.Therefore, it is concluded that there is not a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Moving the Technical Specifications for the ``High Reactor VesselWater Level'' trip function from the HPCI System and RCIC System isolationinstrumentation tables and the addition of this trip function to the HPCISystem actuation instrumentation surveillance table does not reduce theoperation of the HPCI or RCIC Systems from existing requirements and theyare still bounded by the assumptions used in the safety analysis. Althoughthe ``High Reactor Vessel Water Level'' trip function is to be moved asdescribed above, its functions regarding HPCI (turbine trip) and RCIC (turbinetrip and restart) remain the same. As such, an inoperative high reactorvessel water level parameter would affect RCIC and HPCI operation and isstill addressed by Technical Specification requirements pertaining to operabilityof these systems. In addition, the same high level trip function is tobe included in the Vermont Yankee Technical Specifications under RCIC actuationinstrumentation and is presently included in the Technical Specificationsunder HPCI actuation instrumentation (limiting conditions of operation).The proposed change does not result in any change in Technical Specificationsetpoints, plant operation, protective function, or design basis of theplant. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Moving the Technical Specifications for the ``High Reactor VesselWater Level'' trip function from the HPCI System and RCIC System isolationinstrumentation tables and the addition of this trip function to the HPCISystem actuation instrumentation surveillance table does not affect anyexisting safety margins. Operation of these systems will remain the same.This change, when combined with Change A as described in this letter, essentiallymoves the listing of the trip function from portions of the Technical Specificationwhere it is not directly applicable to the sections where it is directlyapplicable. All existing functions of the ``High Reactor Vessel Water Level''trip relative to HPCI and RCIC operation are still subject to existingTechnical Specification requirements for HPCI and RCIC operability. Allexisting requirements for surveillance and testing of these systems relevantto the high reactor water level parameter are maintained. Assurance thatboth HPCI and RCIC Systems operate within limits determined to be acceptablecontinues to be provided. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance for the application of the standardsin 10CFR50.92 by providing certain examples (51FR7751, dated March 6, 1986)of actions likely to involve no significant hazards consideration. Oneof these examples (i) is a purely administrative change to the TechnicalSpecifications; for example, a change to achieve consistency throughoutthe Technical Specifications, correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.Proposed Change B falls within the scope of this Commission example sinceit involves moving, but not deleting, the subject trip function withinthe Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, we conclude that these proposed changes (Changes A andB) do not constitute a significant hazards consideration, as defined in10CFR50.92(c). </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

More specifically these changes would: A. Remove a portion of Section 4.2 Bases that is no longer pertinent. B. Delete the APRM flux scram trip setting definition in Section 2.1 ofthe Technical Specifications and provide a definition in a single locationin the TS by referencing Section 3.11 B of the Technical Specificationsfor the definition. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a signficanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a signficant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofthese standards by providing certain examples [March 6, 1986, 51FR7751].An example of an amendment that is considered not likely to involve a significanthazards consideration is Example (i) which is a purely administrative changeto Technical Specifications: for example, a change to achieve consistencythroughout the Technical Specifications, correction of an error, or a changein nomenclature. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposed Change (A) corrects an administrative error introduced inAmendment No. 106 by deleting a portion of the Section 4.2 Bases whichis no longer applicable. This change, therefore, does not significantlyincrease the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedsince deletion of the subject Bases section is administrative in natureand does not affect plant operation. The proposed change does not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyevaluated because the change is administrative in nature, and no physicalalterations of plant configuration, changes to setpoints, or operatingparameters are proposed. The proposed change does not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety because the change involves a correctionto a Bases section and does not affect any operating practices, limits,or safety-related equipment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposed Change (B) corrects an administrative oversight introducedin Amendment No. 108 to specifically define the LHGR limits in one locationof the Technical Specifications. This change, therefore, does not significantlyincrease the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the change is administrative and does not weaken or degrade thefacility. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident previously evaluated because the change isadministrative and ensures that the plant does not exceed the applicablesafety limits. The proposed change does not involve a significant reductionin a safety margin because the change is administrative and does not involveany physical change to the facility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Both proposed changes described above are editorial in nature andserve to correct administrative oversights in the Technical Specifications.Accordingly, both proposed changes fall within the scope of the Commission'sExample (i) cited above and, thus, do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

Thischange is necessitated by the installation of the ATWS mitigating systemactuation circuity (AMSAC) at Point Beach, which will bypass the ``Tripof both Main Feedpumps starts motor driven pump'' auxiliary feedwater actuationwhen reactor power is less than 40%. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendment to anoperating license involves no significant hazards consideration if operationof the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1)involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has previously provided to the NRC detailed descriptions ofthe AMSAC proposed for installation at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant. Thisinformation was provided in a letter dated April 23, 1987, and supplementedin letters dated December 30, 1987 and March 2, 1988. The Point Beach designwas approved in a safety evaluation by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation,``Compliance with ATWS Rule 10 CFR 50.62'' dated August 4, 1988. This design,as approved, provided for an operational bypass at 40% reactor power. The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationin its request for a license amendment. (1) The modification requested in the proposed amendment amounts to anadministrative clarification of an existing specification. As such, thechange, of itself, does not have any impact upon the plant systems, structures,or components, and therefore cannot have any impact upon the significanthazards consideration standards listed above. (2) The need for this clarification of the technical specifications resultsfrom the proposed installation of an AMSAC at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant.This installation was mandated by the NRC in 10 CFR 50.62. The NRC haspreviously determined in the statement of consideration promulgated withthe significant hazards consideration rule (51 FR 7751) that a change tomake a licensee conform to changes in the regulations, where the changeresults in very minor changes to facility operation, is not likely to involvea significant hazards consideration.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By April 21, 1989, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect.
