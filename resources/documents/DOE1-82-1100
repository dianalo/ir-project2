The feedstock to be testedwas a mixture of New Brunswick oil shale and high sulfur Minto coal.The pyrolysis program was not as successful as anticipated due to difficultiesin controlling the operating parameters. As a result, the pyrolysis cyclecould not be sustained for an extended period of time and no oil wasgenerated. Efforts were dircted towards the gasification of the coaland oil shale. The objectives were to optimize the gas quality and sulphurcapture by the oil shale. The reactor system was operated reliably withthe coal and oil shale under a wide range of operating conditions. Thecalorific value of the gas ranged from 0.44 to 0.95 MJ/m/sup 3/. Theformer was obtained with coal only, while the latter with 1:3 coal-oilshale mix. Corresponding sulphur capture ranged varied from 0% to 71%.None of the independent variables investigated, except the ratio of coal-oilshale mix, showed any significant effect on the gas quality. The calorificvalue of the gas was found to increase with the increase in the proportionof oil shale in the feed. Similar trend was also observed for sulphurcapture. 6 refs., 8 figs., 15 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
