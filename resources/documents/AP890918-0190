(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The question before the court remains:What is entertainment?   It is a subject discussed the livelong day in this gritty littletown of 6,700 in the Pennsylvania hills, especially over the plywoodcounter of Dad's Coffee Shop, an unremarkable establishment in everyrespect save one. At Dad's, the waitresses, who serve the coffee inStyrofoam cups, are naked from the waist up.   Well, not quite. The law says they must wear what are calledpasties, tiny stick-on things that glitter and seem to serve only toaccentuate the obvious, and Dad says he insists on operatingstrictly within the law.   Dad is Thomas Wasley Jr., a stout man of 46 with wire-rimmedglasses, thick black hair just going to gray, and brown eyes thatplead astonishment over the trouble that has befallen him.   Wasley and his coffee shop came into prominence last May, duringa local election campaign as it happened, which brought him moreattention, and customers, than his small ads in the sports sectionof the Scrantonian Tribune ever produced.   ``I even got a call from a radio station in Australia,'' he wassaying the other day, over coffee. ``I thought it was phony atfirst, but it wasn't. That's when I put up that map.''   The map of the United States is about the only thing thatdecorates the pale walls of the coffee shop. That and a bulletinboard covered with newspaper clippings about the dispute over themeaning of entertainment. A legend above the map asks, ``How far didyou come to Dad's?'' Pins are stuck in about a dozen states.   Now business has fallen off from 500 or so customers a day toabout 75, and the paper will no longer run Dad's ads.   ``People think I'm closed,'' Wasley said. ``I'm struggling, butI'm not closed.''   Not closed, but subject to a fine of $500 a day since the citymagistrate determined, in a 13-page decision rendered June 26, thatDad's Coffee Shop was providing ``live entertainment'' for which heneeded a special permit under the zoning law.   Wasley has appealed to a county court and says he will continueif necessary to appeal to higher courts on up the line.   The magistrate, John E.V. Pieski, ruled that since the zoningstatute did not define ``live entertainment'' he would use thedictionary definition: ``The act of diverting, amusing or causingsomeone's time to pass agreeably.''   ``That would apply to cheerful waitresses at Dunkin' Donuts,''says Wasley.   But, argued the magistrate, Wasley advertised his waitresses, nothis coffee.   ``So do the places that advertise their waitress-of-the-monthinstead of their food,'' says Wasley.   But when Wasley's waitresses went from wearing swimsuits tobaring their breasts, ruled the magistrate, the price of his coffeedoubled to $2 a cup, no refills. A clear indication, he ruled, thatWasley considered them live entertainment and waitresses onlyincidentally.   ``All price reflects is overhead. You have to hire topless girlsfrom out of town, pay agency fees, motel room costs. That stilldoesn't mean they constitute live entertainment,'' says Wasley.``They don't sing or dance. All they do is serve coffee.''   The debate lingers on.   According to John Maholic, the borough president, the dispute wasmore political than semantic. ``If it were not an election year itwould never have come up,'' he argues.   The pot boiled over a few weeks before the May 16 Democraticprimary when a group of residents presented to the council apetition with 1,100 signatures opposing Dad's ``or any otherenterprise of obscene nature.''   ``In a town of 6,700,'' said Maholic, ``1,000 names is a lot ofvoters.''   The resident who headed the petition drive, Frank Siderowicz,says there is nothing to the idea politics is involved.   ``It was a moral issue from the beginning,'' he insists. ``Wecollected those signatures outside our churches after services.Politics was never mentioned. It was a coincidence that an electioncampaign was going on.   ``This is small-town America. A topless coffee shop doesn't fit.''   Dickson City is a small town all right, but hardly typical ofwhat the phrase usually conveys. It abuts a string of similarcommunities just north of Scranton, suburbs really, whose varyingethnic makeups reflect the immigrant groups who arrived here yearsago to dig coal.   It is a town of seven churches and 15 taverns. It also features atopless go-go joint, The Rose, which is across the street from theborough hall, and a porno shop on a major highway that cuts throughtown.   ``Both of those places were objected to when they opened, but forsome legal reasons they were allowed to remain,'' said Siderowicz.``Dad's Coffee Shop was something we could do something about, so wedid.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
