The Shapiros co-own the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;The Colbys&quot; in a venture with Spelling Productions.    As part of the settlement, Spelling Productions said Esther Shapiro will become Spelling Productions senior vice president for creative and corporate affairs, a new position. The company said Richard Shapiro will provide his exclusive writing services for television to Spelling Productions. He also will develop feature films for the company. In addition, the Shapiros have been granted major stock options in Spelling Productions, the company said.    In August, the Shapiros filed a suit against Spelling Productions asking $180 million in damages. The suit claimed that Spelling Productions' public offering earlier this year breached the Shapiros' agreement with the company. The suit alleged that the company's transference of the Shapiros' 60% holding in &quot;Dynasty&quot; to the Spelling publicly held corporation required their approval and that they had been excluded from profits from the public offering. In the offering, Spelling Productions sold 5.5 million shares at $14 each.    In October, the Shapiros filed another suit seeking $40 million. The suit alleged that Spelling Productions illegally kept them from owning a stake in the television series &quot;Hotel.&quot; The Shapiros claimed that they had helped develop &quot;Hotel&quot; but that Spelling Productions hadn't given them part-ownership in the series.    A Spelling Productions spokesman declined to say whether the Shapiros had received any money in the settlement. The Shapiros couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
