The closely held company announced it had succeeded insplicing the human hemoglobin gene into pigs. Currently, DNXhas three pigs with human hemoglobin circulating in theirblood streams, John Logan, vice president for research, saidin an interview. Mr. Logan presented technical details of theexperiments last night to the World Congress on Cell andTissue Culture meeting in Anaheim, Calif.</LP><TEXT>   Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red bloodcells that carries oxygen from the lungs to tissuesthroughout the body and removes the carbon dioxide. A numberof efforts are under way to develop genetically engineeredhemoglobin that could be mass-produced as a cheap syntheticblood. Such a synthetic blood would be free of viruses suchas the AIDS and hepatitis viruses that contaminate donatedhuman blood. It also could be given to any person withoutworries about bloodtype matching and it would have a longershelf life than whole human blood.   Such a synthetic blood would be useful for the military,particularly on the battlefield, and as transfusions foraccident victims in remote locations. It also could provide abackup supply when donated human blood is scarce.   One such synthetic blood, however, has hit a stumblingblock. A spokesman for Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich.,confirmed that the big drug maker had suspended human trialsof a hemoglobin blood substitute using hemoglobin fromcattle. The bovine-derived hemoglobin was developed byBiopure Corp., a Boston-based biotechnology company.   &quot;There were some medical events that we didn't expect&quot; inthe volunteers who were receiving the synthetic blood madewith the bovine hemoglobin, an Upjohn spokesman, JamesVanSweden, said. &quot;But we haven't given up on it,&quot; he added,noting that new animal experiments are underway. SomatogenInc. in Boulder, Colo., is developing a synthetic blood usinghuman hemoglobin produced by genetically engineered bacteria.An attempt to genetically engineer tobacco plants to producehuman hemoglobin is being made by Biosource Genetics Corp. inVacaville, Calif. Other companies in the field include QuestBiotechnology Inc. in Detroit, which has licensed itshemoglobin technology to four companies: Baxter HealthcareCorp., Hemosol Inc. in Canada, Northfield Laboratories Inc.in Chicago and Biopure.   DNX said it believes genetically altered pigs will be ableto produce hemoglobin in large volumes and at lower cost thanwould be possible with bacteria, yeasts or other cellscommonly used in genetic engineering. The company predictedthat with pigs it could produce human hemoglobin at a cost ofless than $1 a gram, a small fraction of the cost of mostgenetically engineered pharmaceuticals.   DNX said it has been working with Pig Improvement Co. inFranklin, Ky., for several years on inserting &quot;foreign&quot; genesinto pigs. While splicing new genes into laboratory mice isbecoming almost routine, inserting new genes into largeanimals has proven difficult. The new gene is inserted into atest tube embryo while it is still a single cell. The embryois then implanted into a sow which gives birth to thegenetically altered piglet.   DNX has developed a &quot;micro-injection&quot; technique forinserting genes into embryos at the single cell stage. Mr.Logan said DNX and the researchers in Kentucky attempted toinsert the human hemoglobin gene into more than 90 pigsbefore three were born with the human gene functioning andproducing human hemoglobin.   A second advance claimed by DNX researchers was theability to separate the human hemoglobin from the porcineversion in the pigs' blood. The two hemoglobins are 85%identical molecularly and function in almost identical ways.Mr. Logan said the company had adapted a technology known asanion exchange chromotography for extracting and purifyingthe human hemoglobin.   The company said it hopes to ask the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration next year for permission to test itspig-produced human hemoglobin in human volunteers.</TEXT></DOC>
