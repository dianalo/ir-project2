Snow advisories were in effect today for the northern andsouthern Sierra Nevada and for the mountains of northeasternCalifornia. At least 6 inches of snow fell Monday on parts of theSierra Nevada.   The storm forced closure of state Highway 120 into Yosemite andprompted the California Highway Patrol to require drivers to putchains on their vehicle wheels when traveling on mountain roads,including state Highways 80 and 50.   The storm also encouraged eager skiers, said Marilyn Graham, anoperator for the Hyatt Lake Tahoe hotel.   ``If there's a big storm like this, they naturally think it'sski time,'' she said.   Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were expected today inthe San Francisco Bay area. On Monday heavy rain complicated thearea's cleanup from last week's earthquake.
