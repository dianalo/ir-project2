IBM President Jack D. Kuehler was quoted in today's editions ofThe New York Times as saying the company is producing a four-megabitmemory chip ``in volume'' _ an industry expression that generallymeans in sufficient quantities for commercial application.   That would put International Business Machines several monthsahead in the race to mass-produce this type of dynamic random accessmemory chip, or DRAM.   Kuehler did not return telephone messages left on his home phonefor comment on the Times article, but IBM spokesman Peter Judicetold The Associated Press Thursday night: ``I can confirm we areproducing four-megabit chips in volume.''   IBM's disclosure was considered significant not only because theworld's biggest computer company historically has avoided givingaway secrets, but because it came one day after U.S. computer makersannounced a joint venture to challenge's Japan's perceived supremacyin making the chip.   IBM and six other companies said they would form the first U.S.consortium to build memory chips. The consortium, known as U.S.Memories Inc., expects to mass-produce the chip starting in a fewyears.   IBM has suggested in the past that it has a strong interest in asolid U.S. chip-producing industry. That partly explains why thecompany is willing to share its technology with the consortium,computer industry executives say.   It had been widely assumed Japan was leading in the battle togain early dominance in production of the four-megabit chip, anelectronics component that can store 4 million bits of information,or four times as much as any previous chip. The four-megabit chip isconsidered a vital element of virtually all of the advancedconsumer-product and defense technology of tomorrow.   Gordon Moore, chairman of U.S. Memories, said the consortium willuse IBM's advances in four-megabit chips to ``have the jump-startneeded to quickly come on line as a serious player.''   The other companies announcing the consortium were: AdvancedMicro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp.   If approved, the venture would break new ground in the federalgovernment's attitude toward cooperation between competingcompanies. The government has been steadily more permissive towarddeals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the theorythat concerted action is necessary to meet foreign competition.</TEXT></DOC>
