In addition, a college friend of the 24-year-old trader, StephenWang, was accused in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of making$30,000 in profits from illegal information supplied by Wang in aseparate scheme.   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen approved a final settlement inwhich Wang, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to pay$127,585 to satisfy claims arising from his role in what thegovernment has called one of the biggest inside trading frauds inhistory.   Under the settlement between Wang and the Securities and ExchangeCommission, a court-appointed receiver will oversee and distributethe money to cover claims by investors who said they lost moneybecause of Wang.   The SEC also filed a complaint charging that Jerome B. Cronin,also 24, of Chicago, allegedly traded in stocks of at least sixcompanies using tips provided by Wang, who was sentenced lastOctober to three years in jail.   In a settlement with the SEC also approved Tuesday, Cronin agreedto pay back $20,000 in illegal profits. He did not admit or denyguilt.   The SEC's civil complaint alleges that Cronin violated anti-fraudprovisions and received non-public information from Wang aboutupcoming tender offers and other pending corporate action.   The alleged illegal transactions occurred via telephone betweenWang in New York and Cronin in Chicago, who knew each other asundergraduates at the University of Illinois, from July 1986 throughat least September 1987, according to the complaint.   ``We're saying (Cronin) knew this was inside information,'' SECspokesman Chiles Larson said.   Wang, then a junior analyst with the prestigious investment firmMorgan Stanley andamp; Co., pleaded guilty to conspiring with Taiwanesebusinessman Fred C. Lee to profit in the stock market on secretsabout pending corporate takeovers. The SEC said Lee made about $19million in illicit profits and paid Wang $200,000.   At the time, Wang also pleaded guilty to a separate, smallerinsider trading scheme with an another party, now identified asCronin.   The SEC complaint states that Cronin made at least $30,000 fromthe information and paid Wang $4,000.   Cronin allegedly traded in the securities of at least sixpublicly held companies: Lehigh Press Inc., Utah Power andamp; Light Co.,Rexnord Inc., Colt Industries Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.,and Burlington Industries Inc.   The charges against Wang were first disclosed last June.   At the time, the amount of allegedly illicit profits and thegovernment's requested penalties, totaling $76 million, made it thesecond-largest securities fraud case behind the $100 million inillicit profits and penalties surrendered by jailed speculator IvanBoesky in 1986.   The Wang case was considered important because much of theactivity came during the height of publicity surrounding Boesky.   In December, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to plead guiltyto six felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines in thelargest securities fraud case on record.</TEXT></DOC>
