Industry and government reports show that the nation'soutput of crude oil recently slipped below 7.4 millionbarrels a day, after being around or even above that figuresince late last year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Evidence continues to accumulate that domesticproduction's decline trend may be resuming after a temporaryinterruption during the past year or so,&quot; the AmericanPetroleum Institute reported.   The API, the oil industry's largest association, releasedits monthly report for November yesterday. For the year todate, the API's figures showed crude output still slightly upfrom the first 11 months of 1990. In the latest period,production averaged 7,378,000 barrels a day, compared with7,357,000 barrels a day in the year-earlier 11 months. Butfor November, the API measured crude production at only7,266,000 barrels a day, down from 7,387,000 barrels a day inthe year-earlier month.   Changes in the level of U.S. crude oil output areimportant for reasons that reach well beyond the nation's oilindustry. The U.S., the world's leading oil consumer, is alsothe biggest customer of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries. Declines in output eventually will bereflected in higher oil imports. Higher U.S. imports can havean impact on oil prices as well as on the nation's tradebalance.   Until the Persian Gulf crisis began, U.S. oil productionhad been declining since early 1986, mainly because of theoil-price collapse that year, followed by relatively low oilprices of more recent years. But after Iraq raised fears ofworld oil shortages by invading Kuwait in August 1990, oilprices escalated temporarily.   Also, federal and state governments in the U.S. movedswiftly to loosen regulations to help oil producers increaseoutput in the wake of the Iraqi invasion. And many producerspostponed maintenance work on their wells in order to keepoil flowing while prices were good.   For much of 1991, however, oil prices have been aboutone-third lower than at the beginning of the year, with thebenchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, around $20 abarrel. Natural gas prices have been even more depressed,falling to around $1 a thousand cubic feet last summer, thelowest level in 12 years. That meant less drilling for eitheroil or gas because gas accounts for nearly three-fourths ofthe revenue of independent oil producers.   As a result of these developments, seismic activity,drilling permits, well drilling and well servicing allcontinue to be down at double-digit rates in year-to-yearcomparisons. The seismic crew count has fallen to the lowestlevel in more than 50 years.   Also, according to industry reports, active drilling rigsoperating in the U.S. will average only slightly more than800 for 1991, the slowest rate since World War II. The APInoted that the number of rigs searching for oil at the end ofNovember was down 22% from a year earlier.   &quot;With gas prices remaining depressed, and with crudeprices dropping $3 to $4 a barrel during the month, financialincentives for increases in either drilling or productionhave been limited,&quot; the API said.   Other industry and government assessments support the APIview on domestic oil production. For the first 339 days of1991, production figures reported by the U.S. Department ofEnergy are the same as those of the API. For the four weeksended last Friday, however, the DOE's Energy InformationAdministration yesterday estimated that domestic productionaveraged 7,180,000 barrels a day, down from 7,366,000 barrelsa day in the year-earlier period.   The Independent Petroleum Association of America, or IPAA,estimates that U.S. crude oil production will average7,340,000 barrels a day for 1991. For next year, however, theIPAA predicts that output will average seven million barrelsa day.   Deborah Rowell, vice president of economics for the IPAA,suggested that whatever gains U.S. oil production may haveexperienced from the Persian Gulf crisis now have been lostby lower prices and by &quot;a negative feeling&quot; in the industryabout the future world oil market. &quot;We had a temporaryrespite&quot; from production declines of recent years, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
