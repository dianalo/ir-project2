Several methods have been developedfor converting these historical data to the solar irradiance availableon a sloping surface. The authors evaluated five such methods using alimited set of solar irradiance measurements taken at their outdoor laboratoryover a 41-day period, 22 July to 4 September 1984. The preliminary andlimited results indicate all five algorithms overestimate (18%-46%) thesolar irradiance on north-facing vertical surfaces and perform the best(+-5%) for south-facing surfaces. The authors' estimate of the totalmeasurement uncertainty associated with this analysis is +-5.6%.</TEXT></DOC>
