 In addition, the prices for additionalpublication packages will be increased by $75.00 to cover the costsassociated with these two publications.andP;  These increases will be effectiveJuly 1, 1990.andM;Strategic Planning ReportandM;Council unanimously adopted the Strategic Planning Report, &quot;StrategicPlanning for the 1990s,&quot; as the central guideline for future ACM activities.andM;This report recommends five courses of action for ensuring a vibrant,exciting future for ACM:andM;I.andP;  Provide information for planning.andM;II.andP;  Make ACM publications more responsive to their readers.andM;III.andP;  Make the SIG structure more responsive to the field.andM;IV.andP;  Provide for career growth of computing professionals.andM;V.andP;  Create public awareness.andM;Council unanimously endorsed the following plans to begin action onObjectives I and V:andM;Lorraine Borman will put together a task force of volunteers and staff toestablish a set of information needs for the organization, including SIGS,education, publications, and local units as well as general membership andwill initiate a procedure for collecting that information.andM;Bert Herzog, Walter Carlson, and Joseph DeBlasi will form a small group tofocus on developing a collection of public awareness activities (a proposedcommission to promote the awareness and discussion of issues in computing,the Government Information and Activities Committee and other committeesunder the auspices of the External Activities Board, the Computing ResearchBoard, task forces of the National Research Council, an ACM presence inWashington, and the Blue Ribbon Panel on Intellectual Property Rights).andO;Their first objective is to identify and propose activities that will promotepublic awareness, specifically with regard to issues in computing.andP;  Theirsecond objective is to recommend a new organizational structure that willintegrate the appropriate committees of the External Activities Board and theproposed strategic planning unit for public awareness.andM;ATandamp;T Support of ACM Scholastic Programming ContestandM;ACM and ATandamp;T have entered into a long-term agreement for ATandamp;T sponsorship ofthe ACM Scholastic Programming Contest (12 regional contests, as well as thefinals).andP;  Council, by acclamation, thanked ATandamp;T Computer Systems for itsgenerous support of the ACM Scholastic Programming Contest.andM;By acclamation, Council expressed its great appreciation to William Poucher,Programming Contest Director, and Jim Adams, Director of Membership andStrategic Services, for their initiative and hard work in obtaining ATandamp;Tsupport for the ACM Scholastic Programming Contest.andM;ATandamp;T to Fund A.M.andP;  Turing AwardandM;Council, by a vote of 23 For, 1 Abstention (Michael Garey), approved thefollowing proposal for ATandamp;T funding of the A.M.andP;  Turing Award as follows:andM;1.andP;  ATandamp;T will provide ACM with funds of $25,000 per year (plus 10 percent foradministrative expenses), to be used for the ACM A.M.andP;  Turing Award.andM;2.andP;  All ACM announcements, distributions, and brochures about the award willcarry the note: &quot;Financial support for the ACM A.M.andP;  Turing Award is providedby ATandamp;T.&quot;

 Council Affirms Constitution and Bylaws Committee InterpretationBy a vote of 23 For, 0 Opposed, 1 Abstention, Council affirmed theinterpretation of the Constitution and Bylaws Committee that should the ACMPresident be reelected, the current Past President continues to serve as thePast President.andM;Time and Place of Next MeetingandM;The next meeting of Council will be held at the 1990 ACM/IEEE DesignAutomation Conference (DAC '90) on Wednesday, June 27, and Friday, June 29,1990 in Orlando, Florida.andM;TWO TRACKS TO COVER CRITICAL COMPUTING ISSUESandM;&quot;Managing Complexity&quot; and &quot;Modeling Reality&quot; will be the featured topics atthe upcoming ACM conference, &quot;Responsible Leadership in Computing&quot; (seeCommunications, April 1990, p. 469), the first in a series of ACM conferenceson critical issues in computing.andP;  In a first-of-its-kind format, the 200-300conference participants will be split into two tracks, each designed to takeon one of the two issue areas.andP;  The intent in each track is to bring together100-150 responsible leaders from computing and related disciplines to developan agenda for action toward solution to the problems that have arisen indealing with these issues.andM;In each of the two tracks, attendees will hear information designed to deepentheir understanding of the issue; illuminating evidence of successes andfailures; analyses of the common problems to be addressed; and commentaryfrom others in attendance.andP;  Then attendees will participate in small groupsto 1) assess the critical factors, 2) recommend action arenas, 3) decide onaction priorities, and 4) set an agenda for taking action over the nextseveral years.andM;Managing Complexity TrackandM;According to Harold Stone, IBM Research Center, who heads the &quot;ManagingComplexity&quot; Track, &quot;Complex computer systems have raised challenging problemsfor the coming decade.andP;  By providing new functions and enhanced productivity,such systems have become major assets in industry and government.andP;  However,the implementation of complex computer systems is extremely risky.andO;Implementation of systems of high complexity can fail to reach objectives.andO;Even if successful, their complexity can produce success at extraordinarycost.andP;  Pragmatic issues such as usability, reliability, and security canimpact the quality of service provided.andP;  Once installed, a complex system mayconstrain services offered if system complexity impedes evolution of thesystem.andM;We must nourish and implement complex systems to meet the future needs ofcommerce and government, yet we must avoid the pitfalls that produce productfailures and excessive costs, What are the issues that need to be addressedto reduce risk and assure success? Understanding these issues is essential totap the full potential of computer technology&quot;.andM;Modeling Reality TrackandM;Steven Kline of Stanford University and Robert Benjamin, retired from Xerox,head the &quot;Modeling Reality&quot; Track.andP;  They point out that &quot;The modeling realitytrack will develop three topics: 1) Illustrating the modeling environment, 2)Discussing the limits of computer modeling, and 3) Considering effects of theintroduction of computers into the control of work.andP;  Within each topic theopportunities for improving understanding and control as well as the hazardsin creating misleading results, wrong policy decisions or bureaucraticovercontrol by the use of computer models will be addressed.andM;In illustrating the modeling environment, an overview of the nature of theparadigm shift we are living through and the opportunities and hazards thisshift creates will be presented.andP;  The limits of computer modeling willconsider the questions: &quot;What systems are so complex that we cannot nowcreate appropriate computer models? What types of errors do we incur when weignore these limits? Can we move the limits in the future?&quot; In discussing thecomputer control of work the opportunities for increased understanding andcontrol, the physical, emotional, psycho-social and political responses ofhumans and the potential for bureaucratic overcontrol will be examined.&quot;andM;The conference will be held November 6 and 7 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel inArlington, Virginia.andP;  For additional information, contact Jim Adams, ACM, 11West 42d.andP;  Street, New York, NY 10036, (212) 869-7440.andP;  FAX: 212-869-1228.andM;NEW ZEALAND'S UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO CAPTURES 1990 ACM SCHOLASTIC PROGRAMMINGCROWNandM;Maryland, Stanford Top Two U.S.andP;  FinishersandM;Student programming teams from the University of Otago (New Zealand), theUniversity of Maryland and Stanford University claimed first, second, andthird place, respectively, in the finals of the 14th Annual ACM ScholasticProgramming Contest, winning over 21 other regional finalists in thisone-of-a-kind international computing competition.andM;The event, sponsored by ATandamp;T Computer Systems, took place at CSC  go inWashington, DC.andP;  Four-person teams competed from universities in the U.S.,andO;Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Rim in a five-hour battle of logic, strategyand mental endurance.andP;  Each team had to solve as many problems as possible inthe least amount of time, with the fewest number of tries.andM;Contestants created programs to answer such puzzles as: how to calculate thefastest and least costly air travel routes from one end of the U.S.andP;  toanother, taking into account waiting times in terminals and other delays;predicting whether ships at sea will collide or pass in the night just byobserving the position of their running lights; and how to divide thewinnings in a PGA golf tournament given a complex set of rules.andP;  In all,eight problems were posed to the teams, with the top six teams each solvingfive problems in the allotted time.andM;ATandamp;T Computer Systems awarded a total of $25,000 in scholarships to the sixtop-ranking schools to foster the study of computer science.andP;  In addition,the company donated ATandamp;T 6386/25 Workgroup Systems computers to the top fourschools.andM;Teams finishing in fourth to sixth place were Harvard University; EindhovenTechnical University, The Netherlands; and the University ofWisconsin-Madison.andM;Other competing teams included, in order of contest ranking were: LeidenUniversity, The Netherlands; University of Southwestern Louisiana; DukeUniversity; Virginia Tech.; Beloit College; Purdue University; University ofOregon; University of Calgary, Canada; Swarthmore College; University ofCentral Florida; University of Colorado; New Jersey Institute of Technology;California Institute of Technology; Case Western Reserve University; TexasTech University; Bucknell University; Columbia University; and SUNY-Albany.andM;&quot;These teams represent some of the best and the brightest computer studentsin the world,&quot; said Baylor University computer science professor William B.andO;Poucher, the ACM contest director.andP;  &quot;These young men and women represent thecompetitive spirit and creative genius of the generation that will propel theInformation Age into the 21st century.&quot;andM;At the conference awards luncheon, Gordon Bridge, president of ATandamp;T ComputerSystems, announced that ATandamp;T has entered into a long-term agreement with ACMto sponsor the 12 regional scholastic programming contests, as well as thefinals.andP;  Next year's finals will be held in San Antonio, Texas.andM;&quot;ATandamp;T Computer Systems believes events like the ACM contest will encouragemore people to enter the critical fields of computing and encourageexcellence in the art and science of software development,&quot; said Bridge.andM;The ACM Scholastic Programming Contest began in 1970 at Texas Aandamp;M University.andO;The competition, which was expanded in 1977 to include 12 regional contestsand a finals, is held each year during ACM's annual Computer ScienceConference.andM;Planning for the 1991 Contest Finals, scheduled for March 6, in San Antonio,Texas, is already under way.andP;  The contest organizers invite all interestedACM members to submit potential problems for the contest.andP;  A problemsubmission must include a problem statement, a solution written in Pascal orC, and sample test data.andP;  For further information, contact Jo Perry, Headjudge for the 1991 Contest Finals, at the following address:andM;Jo PerryandM;Department of Computer ScienceandM;North Carolina State UniversityandM;Raleigh, NC 27695-8206andM;919-737-7970andM;email: jep@cscadm.ncsu.eduandM;PERLIS OBITUARY ACKNOWLEDGMENTSandM;A listing acknowledging contributors to the Alan J.
