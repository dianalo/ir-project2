The case involves a major lawsuit over the 1980 silver-market collapse.    As previously reported, U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker last week in an oral ruling refused to dismiss a total of five defendants from a $200 million suit brought by Minpeco S.A., a minerals concern owned by the Peruvian government.    The suit, set for trial Feb. 3, has already garnered Minpeco out-of-court settlements totaling $27 million from E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., Banque Populaire Suisse and Continental Grain Co.'s Conti-Commodity Services Inc. unit.    Besides Merrill Lynch, Prudential-Bache, and Donaldson Lufkin's ACLI International Commodity Services Inc. unit, the judge last week refused dismissal motions from silver traders Mahmoud Fustok and Lamar Hunt. Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Donaldson Lufkin is a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society.    While the case involves &quot;difficult and close questions,&quot; the judge said in a written opinion filed yesterday, the information gathered by the plaintiffs &quot;contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that these five defendants participated in a conspiracy to manipulate silver prices.&quot;    The judge noted that by October 1979, the Hunts controlled 100 million ounces of silver, close to 100% of the Commodity Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade warehouse stocks. &quot;Hence, Bache had information strongly suggesting that the Hunts were in the process of establishing a dominant position in the silver futures market, an important indicator of manipulative intent,&quot; he said.    The five defendants don't deny they were deeply involved in silver trading in 1979 and 1980 -- when silver prices soared to more than $50 an ounce before plunging. But they argue that the evidence presented by Minpeco after years of research doesn't prove they knew about or participated in a conspiracy.    Other defendants in the case include Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt and the CBOT. This week the Commodity Futures Trading Commission opened hearings on the silver collapse in Washington.    Paul Curran, a lawyer for Lamar Hunt and the other Hunts, said he didn't have any comment on the judge's action. </TEXT></DOC>
