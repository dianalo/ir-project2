But so far, despite the allies' businesslike battering of Iraqand occupied Kuwait, and despite the midnight missile fire and spiralingrhetoric Iraq has launched in response, the people on each side speak ofpride, of hope and of patient hunkering down.;    That is what people do inthe early days of war, before death begins to eat at their resolve.;    &quot;Tome, the question is not what can we do to make Saddam yield,&quot; says JerroldPost, a George Washington University psychiatrist and an international affairsexpert. &quot;It is to what degree (the Iraqis) will preserve their loyalty tohim.&quot;;    Iraqi morale the key;    &quot;The key issue is Iraqi morale,&quot; saysUniversity of Rochester political scientist John Mueller.;    On the otherside, they are saying the same thing.;    &quot;Saddam has a deep-seated belief inthe Vietnam syndrome in the American psyche,&quot; says Post. &quot;He has the stomachto have massive casualties inflicted on his side, but he believes the UnitedStates doesn't.&quot;;    &quot;Certainly, the country is giving the president thesupport he needs right now,&quot; says Howard Schuman of the University ofMichigan's Institute for Social Research, &quot;but that doesn't necessarily meanmuch in three months.&quot;;    Schuman was a leading analyst of the basis foranti-war sentiment in the Vietnam era, and he found that relatively fewAmericans based their opposition on moral, ethical or religious grounds. Mostwere pragmatists who initially supported the war and then changed their minds,he said, &quot;and the pragmatic group talked almost exclusively about Americancasualties.&quot;;    He doesn't think time or experience has altered thatfundamental reflex. But might the same thing be true of the Iraqis, of anyonein any war?;    &quot;Countries have lost their will to fight before. Historically,the French did in 1940 (against Nazi Germany), the South Vietnamese in 1975(against North Vietnam),&quot; Mueller says. &quot;The hope is that Iraqi morale willcollapse.&quot;;    But from the little information that has slipped from thatclosed and largely unreadable society, nothing suggests a weakening of willsince the allied assault began, partly because so little time has passed butalso because the bombing of Baghdad and other populated areas has beendesigned to avoid widespread civilian casualties.;    But even when massivebombing was used as a basic tactic, in the Vietnam War and in World War II, itdidn't turn many enemy minds.;    &quot;Bombing itself usually just causes afatalistic pulling together,&quot; Mueller says, &quot;not wild panic or attacks on theleadership.&quot;;    Casualties change minds;    What does change minds, he andSchuman agree, is slow, ineffective prosecution of a war and rising numbers ofcasualties -- in a word, an indication that a country seems to be losing.;   In that, Post suggests the Iraqis might indeed measure themselves differently.They might find ways to win while losing, simply because they stood up againstthe world's greatest power, forced it to fight for months and focused theworld on the issues they chose.;    &quot;Kuwait long since went off the screen forSaddam,&quot; says Post, who has spent years analyzing foreign leaders for thegovernment. &quot;Increasingly, with the cynical manipulation of the Palestinianissue . . . he now for the first time is the hero of the Arab masses, fightingthe good fight against Western imperialists. It really has caught him andengaged a lifelong dream of his.&quot;;    Even death became humdrum news in theVietnam conflict, accompanied by redundant announcements of progress andeventual victory. It took big numbers and many years to turn American opiniondecisively against that war.;    This time, though, these observers of war andopinion say, smaller numbers of deaths and months, not years, will make thedifference.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY BLONSTON, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  870  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022009,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
