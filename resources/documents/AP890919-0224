The world's biggest computer company held a news conference toannounce its commitment to ``computer-aided software engineering,''which is intended to make software more reliable and faster todevelop.   More than 30 companies expressed their support for IBM'sblueprint, another demonstration of IBM's influence in thelarge-computer business.   Disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling,patched-together, unmanageable programs that take up valuableprogrammers' time and stall innovation. The problem has become soacute that corporate chief executives are pressing their computerchiefs for a solution.   ``The real driving force behind our industry is that we have gotto figure out how to build better software, faster,'' Kim Addington,vice president for marketing at KnowledgeWare Inc. in Atlanta, saidMonday in advance of the announcement.   Sales of tools for computer-aided software engineering alreadytotal about $300 million a year, even though fewer than 10 percentof customers are even dabbling in it, according to CASE ResearchCorp. of Bellevue, Wash.   CASE Research expects sales to start jumping about a year fromnow when software toolmakers have brought their products into linewith IBM's de facto industry standard.   At least five years will be required to achieve largely automaticprogramming, but IBM's commitment at least legitimizes the conceptof it, consultants say.   ``This is the Holy Grail. The software industry is committingitself to the IBM platform. They don't have to be cajoled into that;they're doing it readily because they see the value of the rulesbeing established,'' Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.,and former IBM software executive, said in an interview Monday.   IBM said it will come out next June with a ``repository,'' alibrary containing the information that all the different softwareengineering tools need to do their jobs. Strict rules will ensurethat all toolmakers structure their information in a consistent way.   The tools will help programmers at every stage, from the analysisof a business problem, to the overall design of a software solution,to the automatic generation and testing of code that actuallycarries out the job.   IBM said programs developed with its so-called AD-Cycle systemwould all have the same look and feel, making them easier for usersto learn how to use.   ``We believe our announcement today is an important event forthis world that runs on software,'' George Conrades, an IBM seniorvice president, said in a prepared statement.   He said programmers' speed has lagged far behind the speed of thecomputers themselves.   ``It doesn't make sense for computers to process hundreds ofmillions of instructions per second, while programmers process just10 instructions per day,'' Conrades said.   By automating, software toolmakers hope to keep programmers'hands off of the actual code so they deal only with the higher-levelproblems of analysis and design.   ``A lot of research has shown that 60 to 70 percent of theproblems in systems are in the analysis and design, so let's put ourmoney where our problems are,'' Greg Boone, president of CASEResearch, said Monday.   The unusual amount of cooperation with other software developers_ some of which sell rival products _ reflects IBM's strategy offorming partnerships instead of trying to do everything itself.   By making it easier to write programs for IBM computers, IBMhopes to sell more machines to existing customers and possiblyattract new customers, Albert said.   Unisys Corp. has promoted computer-aided software engineering forseveral years, but has a much smaller share of the big computermarket than IBM. igital Equipment Corp. has an uncertain strategy inthe field, CASE's Boone said.   Hewlett-Packard, in contrast, is ``sort of the quiet giant'' incomputer-aided software engineering, Boone said. The difference isthat Hewlett-Packard is focusing on aerospace and defenseelectronics, while IBM's major thrust is in the larger commercialmarket.   KnowledgeWare, Bachman Information Systems Inc. and IndexTechnology Corp. will be three of IBM's principal partners incomputer-aided software engineering.</TEXT></DOC>
