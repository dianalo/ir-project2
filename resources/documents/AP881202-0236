In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thepowerful Wall Street buyout firm illustrated the techniques ittypically uses in leveraged buyouts, only on a far grander scale.   The LBO concept is quite simple: After making a smalldownpayment, a firm and its investors borrow the rest of thepurchase and pay off that debt with funds generated by a targetcompany's profits or asset sales. In effect, the business itself isused as collateral.   The borrowing process, though, can get confusing.   ``A lot of the financing is just plain vanilla. That's not thecase here,'' said Robert Waill, a high-yield bond specialist withL.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc.   The RJR buyout will require more than $20 billion in loans tofinance the cash portion of the $109-a-share offer acceptedWednesday by a special RJR directors committee. Kohlberg's offer wasselected over a $25.2 billion bid from a group led by F. RossJohnson, RJR's chief executive.   Besides getting $81 in cash for each of their shares, RJRstockholders will receive a total $4 billion in preferred stock and$2.3 bilion in convertible bonds.   Kohlberg said in its SEC filing that four banks _ Bankers Trust,Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust _ willlend $2.7 billion themselves and assemble a syndicate of other banksto lend an additional $14 billion.   Kohlberg's two main Wall Street financial backers, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., will provide $5 billion inshort-term ``bridge loans'' that will be repaid by sellinghigh-yield, high-risk ``junk bonds,'' according to the SEC filingand a spokeswoman for Kohlberg.   Another $5 billion of existing RJR debt also could becomedowngraded to junk bonds in the processs since the acquistion willmore than quadruple the company's existing debt to $22.3 billion.   The buyout also will make RJR the largest single junk bondissuer, analysts said. Union Carbide Corp. now holds thatdistinction, with $4.2 billion.   ``One major difference is that Union Carbide didn't issue themall at once,'' said Kenneth Urbaszewski, who manages $4 billion injunk bonds at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.   But Urbaszewski believes the high-yield market can absorb thedeluge of expected RJR debt, as long as those issues are pricedright.   ``There's plenty of cash out there now,'' he said.   Urbaszewski noted that despite the huge resulting debt load,RJR's ratio of debt to equity would be only 3-to-1, which isconsidered low for a leveraged buyout. By contrast, Kohlberg's 1986buyout of supermarket giant Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billionleft the acquired company with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1.   The higher the debt load the harder it is for a company to payoff its loans.   For its part, Kohlberg is putting up $1.5 billion in cash for theRJR acquisition, most of which will come from a $5 billion pool ofcapital invested by institutional investors. Kohlberg also islending $500 million for the acquisition, the filing said.   A Kohlberg spokeswoman said she did not know exactly how much ofthe $1.5 billion in cash was coming from the buyout firm itself.However, the Washington Post reported Friday that Kohlberg plannedto put only slightly more than $15 million of its own money into thepurchase.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 3-4</NOTE></DOC>
