Mr. Shamir, in an interview, endorsed a U.S. approach toMideast diplomacy that seeks to establish so-calledconfidence-building measures in the region: agreements onsuch topics as trade and water rights that can serve assteppingstones to peace treaties.</LP><TEXT>   Until now, Israel has called for talks with Arab states&quot;without preconditions&quot; but has insisted that Arab nationsrecognize Israel and end their state of war with the nationas prerequisites in any peace process.   &quot;It's very important to create an atmosphere of mutualconfidence,&quot; Mr. Shamir said. &quot;There are many ways to buildsuch an atmosphere. . . . Of course, our neighbors have togive up this hostility, this belligerence. I think this isthe minimum we have to obtain from all our neighbors beforewe are going to enter real negotiations.   &quot;{But} it's not important what will come after and whatwill come before. Everything that could be useful today tobetter the atmosphere could serve the cause of improving thesituation in the area.&quot;   To buttress the point, Mr. Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner,said the prime minister's remarks were meant to convey a newIsraeli willingness to hold talks with Arab nations on avariety of matters, knowing that such discussions might notlead to full-fledged peace accords.   Mr. Shamir also confirmed that Israel came close toretaliating against Iraq after the first Scud missiles landedin Tel Aviv and Haifa, but was persuaded to restrain itselfby President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.   Mr. Shamir said other Arab nations could be helpful infinding Palestinians with whom Israel can negotiate. But,calling the Golan Heights part of Israel, he dismissedprospects of peace with Syria, calling it &quot;one of the mostextreme countries&quot; in the Mideast.   &quot;You know we are an ancient people,&quot; Mr. Shamir said. &quot;Wehave a lot of patience. We can wait until they change theirmind.&quot;   Though taking his customary hard line on most Arab-Israeliissues, Mr. Shamir's endorsement of incremental peacemakingthrough confidence-building steps may please Secretary ofState James Baker, who begins a tour of the Mideast Friday.He is scheduled to arrive here Monday. U.S. diplomats in TelAviv have said privately for months that the U.S. is eager toapply lessons learned from 20 years of East-West diplomacy inEurope to the Arab-Israeli conflict: mainly, that nationsdon't have to like each other, or even acknowledge the othersexist, to find common ground for dialogue.   &quot;The U.S. was talking arms control with the Soviets at theheight of the Cold War,&quot; notes one U.S. diplomat.   As for specifics, Mr. Shamir suggested that steps could betaken to reduce the possibility of accidental war in theregion. For example, one U.S. diplomat recently suggestedthat Jordanian and Israeli field commanders, facing eachother across the Jordan River, should be connected bytelephones, to provide a quick means of allaying frequentlyaroused suspicions.   &quot;Maybe, maybe,&quot; Mr. Shamir said to that idea. &quot;All thatcould be useful.&quot;   Mr. Shamir, who is 76 years old and presides over the mostconservative government in Israel's history, appeared in nomood to move fast on anything. He said the moment might beright for peace, but &quot;it depends on our neighbors.&quot; Mr.Shamir doesn't have an agenda for Mr. Baker's visit, he said,but expects to have &quot;a free conversation about many aspectsof our chances for peace in the area.&quot;   The Israeli premier disparaged the 1.7 millionPalestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and GazaStrip. He said their identification with Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein was &quot;a good demonstration of what they feeland what they want and to what they aspire.&quot; But he saidIsrael stands by his 1989 peace initiative, despite thestrenuous opposition of right-wing parties in the rulingcoalition. That initiative opposed creation of a Palestinianstate but called for elections in the occupied territoriesand limited self-rule.   Mr. Shamir said Arab members of the &quot;pro-U.S. coalition&quot;and the U.S. could help Palestinians choose a new leadership.   &quot;The Palestinians, as a community, don't have anyexperience in conducting their own interests,&quot; he said.During its 24-year occupation, Israel has locked up hundredsof Palestinian leaders without charges in an action it calls&quot;administrative detention.&quot;   Mr. Shamir also reiterated his government's position thatthe issue of Jewish settlement in the occupied territoriesisn't up for negotiation. Last year, Israel, in return for apromise of $400 million in loan guarantees, promised the U.S.that it wouldn't encourage Soviet immigrants to settle in theterritories. But Israel continues to expand rapidly Jewishsettlements there.   &quot;We have explained many times that the number of Israelisliving in the disputed territories will not have any impacton the results of the negotiations about the permanent statusof these territories,&quot; Mr. Shamir said.   In fact, said the prime minister, Iraq's invasion ofKuwait only strengthened his conviction that Israel mustretain the territories as a strategic buffer zone betweenitself and its Arab neighbors. Some Israelis have drawn theopposite conclusion, after watching 39 Scud missiles sailover the West Bank into Israel, that no amount of real estatecan provide protection in the missile age.   &quot;After the tragic experience of Kuwait, Israel has to bemore aware of the need to have some margins of security,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
