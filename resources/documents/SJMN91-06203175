But as they grow upthey want to sit like adults, with lap and shoulder belts. The force of anaccident can cause small children, ages 4 to 7, to slide under a lap belt, andthe shoulder part fits across the neck rather than the shoulder. Putting theshoulder belt under the child's arm could result in broken ribs.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KEEP MID-SIZE KIDS SAFE IN THE CAR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Family ClipboardFinds  </MEMO><TEXT>     Some manufacturers have begun offering solutions: safety booster seats andother devices to protect kids weighing from about 40 pounds -- the usual limitfor child-seat use -- to 70 pounds, when most children are big enough to usebelts.;    A free list of child-safety seats and booster seats is available bysending a self-addressed stamped business-size envelope to the Safe RideProgram at the American Academy of Pediatrics, P.O.
