In line with this commitment, the members of theintegrated military structure have already made major unilateralcuts in their sub-strategic nuclear armory. ...   Major reductions in Warsaw Pact systems would be of overallvalue to alliance security. One of the ways to achieve this aimwould be by tangible and verifiable reductions of American andSoviet land-based nuclear missile systems of shorter range leadingto equal ceilings at lower levels.   In view of the huge superiority of the Warsaw Pact in terms ofshort-range nuclear missiles, the alliance calls upon the SovietUnion to reduce unilaterally its short-range missile systems to thecurrent levels within the integrated military structure.   The alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventionalstability it pursues the objectives of:   _ the establishment of a secure and stable balance ofconventional forces at lower levels;   _ the elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability andsecurity; and   _ the elimination as a matter of high priority of the capabilityfor launching surprise attack and for initiating large-scaleoffensive action.   ... The Alliance states that one of its highest priorities innegotiations with the East is reaching an agreement on conventionalforce reductions which would achieve the objectives above.   ... The United States has expressed the hope that this could beachieved within six to twelve months. Once implementation of suchan agreement is under way, the United States, in consultation withthe Allies concerned, is prepared to enter into negotiations toachieve a PARTIAL reduction of American and Soviet land-basedmissile forces of shorter range to equal and verifiable levels.   With special reference to the Western proposals on CFE tabled inVienna, enhanced by the proposals by the United States at the May1989 Summit, the Allies concerned proceed on the understanding thatnegotiated reductions leading to a level below the existing levelof their SNF missiles will not be carried out until the results ofthese negotiations have been implemented. Reductions of Warsaw PactSNF systems should be carried out before that date.   ... The question concerning the introduction and deployment of afollow-on system for the Lance will be dealt with in 1992 in thelight of overall security developments. While a decision fornational authorities, the Allies concerned recognize the value ofthe continued funding by the United States of research anddevelopment of a follow-on for the existing Lance short-rangemissile, in order to preserve their options in this respect.</TEXT><NOTE>CONVENTIONAL FORCES</NOTE><TEXT>   As set out in the March 1988 Summit statement and in theAlliance's November 1988 data initiative, the Soviet Union'smilitary presence in Europe, at a level far in excess of its needsfor self-defense, directly challenges our security as well as ouraspirations for a peaceful order in Europe. Such excessive forcelevels create the risk of political intimidation or threatenedaggression. As long as they exist they present an obstacle tobetter political relations between all states of Europe. ...   In addressing these concerns, the Allies' primary objectives areto establish a secure and stable balance of conventional forces inEurope at lower levels, while at the same time creating greateropenness about military organization and activities in Europe.   ... The outcome of the CFE negotiations would provide aframework for determining the future alliance force structurerequired to perform its fundamental task of preserving peace infreedom. In addition, the Allies would be willing to contemplatefurther steps to enhance stability and security if the immediateCFE objectives are achieved _ for example, further reductions orlimitations of conventional armaments and equipment, or therestructuring of armed forces to enhance defensive capabilities andfurther reduce offensive capabilities.   The Allies welcome the declared readiness of the Soviet Unionand other WTO members to reduce their forces and adjust them towarda defense posture and await implementation of these measures. ...</TEXT><NOTE>CHEMICAL WEAPONS</NOTE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union's chemical weapons stockpile poses a massivethreat. The Allies are committed to conclude, at the earliest date,a worldwide, comprehensive and effectively verifiable ban on allchemical weapons. ...</TEXT><NOTE>CONCLUSIONS:</NOTE><NOTE>ARMS CONTROL AND DEFENSE INTERRELATIONSHIPS</NOTE><TEXT>   It is essential that defense and arms control objectives remainin harmony in order to ensure their complementary contribution tothe goal of maintaining security at the lowest balanced level offorces consistent with the requirements of the alliance strategy ofwar prevention, acknowledging that changes in the threat, newtechnologies, and new political opportunities affect options inboth fields. ...   The current negotiations concerning strategic nuclear systems,conventional forces and chemical weapons are, however, independentof one another: the outcome of any one of these negotiations is notcontingent on progress in others. However, they can influence oneanother: criteria established and agreements achieved in one areaof arms control may be relevant in other areas and hence facilitateoverall progress. ...   Taken as a whole, the Allies' arms control agenda constitutes acoherent and comprehensive approach to the enhancement of securityand stability. It is ambitious, but we are confident that _ with aconstructive response from the WTO states _ it can be fullyachieved in the coming years. In pursuing this goal, the alliancerecognizes that it cannot afford to build its security upon armscontrol results expected in the future. The Allies will beprepared, however, to draw appropriate consequences for their ownmilitary posture as they make concrete progress through armscontrol toward a significant reduction in the scale and quality ofthe military threat they face. ...   The Allies' vision for Europe is that of an undivided continentwhere military forces only exist to prevent war and to ensureself-defense; a continent which no longer lives in the shadow ofoverwhelming military forces and from which the threat of war hasbeen removed; a continent where the sovereignty and territorialintegrity of all states are respected and the rights of allindividuals, including their right of political choice, areprotected.   This goal can only be reached by stages; it will require patientand creative endeavor. The Allies are resolved to continue workingtoward its attainment. The achievement of the Alliance's armscontrol objectives would be a major contribution toward therealization of its vision.</TEXT></DOC>
