The issue arose last week, when the plaintiffs' lawyers accused representatives of the companies of jury tampering and asked the judge in the case for a default judgment against the Old Greenwich, Conn., tobacco concern and a local tobacco distributor. The Holmes County district attorney also is investigating the allegations.    The American Brands lawyer said Norman Clark Jr., a cotton farmer hired as a &quot;jury consultant,&quot; spoke with at least three jurors during the trial, which ended last month in a mistrial with a 7-to-5 jury vote in favor of the defendants.    Gray Evans, the Mississippi state judge who presided at the trial here, said in an interview that he had reprimanded two consultants for speaking with members of the jury pool before the trial began last month. He added that during the trial he continued to hear that jurors or their families or neighbors were being contacted.    In an interview, the American Brands lawyer, James Upshaw, of Greenwood, Miss., said Mr. Clark was &quot;just being a good neighbor&quot; in letting several jurors know they didn't have to attend court one day because the judge was sick.    &quot;We're as clean as Mother Teresa.&quot; Mr. Upshaw said. He said that Mr. Clark &quot;didn't hold out $50 bills and say vote for the tobacco company. Besides, he didn't do too good a job of tampering anyway. Two of the people he tampered with voted for the plaintiff. If he'd tampered a little better, we would have had a 9-3 vote for the plaintiff. There was no jury tampering.&quot;    The plaintiffs are the family of Nathan Horton, who died of lung cancer at the age of 50 after smoking Pall Mall cigarettes -- made by American Brands' American Tobacco Co. unit -- for 30 years.    Juror Harvey Gamble said in an affidavit that Mr. Clark called her about five times during the trial. Most of the calls were &quot;what he (Mr. Clark) said were wake-up calls,&quot; Ms. Gamble said in the affidavit. The day the judge was sick, she said, Mr. Clark called her and at least two other jurors &quot;and told us in a friendly voice not to go to court that day.&quot;    After Mr. Clark's call, Ms. Gamble said, &quot;the jury talked about this among themselves, and somebody asked 'How did Norman Clark Jr. know there wasn't going to be no court?', and somebody else said that the tobacco company was paying him.&quot;    Mr. Clark, a cotton farmer in Lexington, didn't return several calls seeking comment. &quot;Norman Clark just wanted to save his neighbors a trip to Lexington,&quot; Mr. Upshaw said.    In an interview, Don Barrett, a lawyer for the Hortons, said Mr. Clark and another tobacco company representative had been warned by Judge Evans to stay away from the jurors even before the trial had begun, after complaints that they were questioning prospective jurors. Last Friday, Judge Evans confirmed he had reprimanded Mr. Clark and another man. Later, however, the judge said he was unsure whether Mr. Clark was one of the two he had reprimanded.    Despite this and other warnings, Judge Evans said, some people -- he wasn't sure who -- continued to contact jurors or their families or neighbors during the trial. At one point in the trial, he said, he felt compelled to admonish lawyers for both sides to stay away from the jurors.    The plaintiff's lawyers say they believe the companies paid local residents $50 an hour and as much as $10,000 to various individuals for jury-consulting work and to attend the trial, sitting behind the defense team.    Ed Blackmon, another lawyer for American Brands, said he asked local residents to attend the trial as a &quot;mirror jury.&quot;    &quot;So what if I paid them,&quot; Mr. Blackmon said. &quot;At the end of every day, I'd quiz them so that they could give us every scrap they could about our defense.&quot;    In an affidavit filed by the plaintiffs' lawyers, Deloris Atkins, a convenience-store clerk, said a local used-car salesman told her the tobacco company was paying him $50 an hour to attend the trial. The salesman, Mac Arthur Gibson, &quot;tried to pay for coffee with a $100 bill . . . and said, 'Baby, you can get some of these,'&quot; Ms. Atkins said in the affidavit.    Mr. Gibson had been employed before the trial as a jury consultant for American Brands' co-defendant, New Deal Tobacco andamp; Candy Co., a cigarette distributor in Greenwood, Miss., according to Calvin King, a New Deal lawyer. But he said Mr. Gibson wasn't paid to attend the trial. Mr. Gibson couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Barrett, the Hortons' lawyer, said a New York City anti-smoking activist, Joseph Chernier, offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who provides information leading to a bribery conviction in the case. Mr. Chernier couldn't be reached for comment.    The development came in the aftermath of widespread disappointment by foes of tobacco, who felt the Horton case had a good chance of becoming the first victory against a tobacco company in a product-liability action.    The stakes were high. If the plaintiffs had won this case, many believe it would have sparked an avalanche of similar lawsuits against tobacco companies. </TEXT></DOC>
