But foreign traders say attendance is down from previous years.   In addition, a Hong Kong textile trader claims, some Chineseexporters from state-run enterprises are protesting the crackdownby dragging their feet on soliciting new business.   ``They are angry about the government, but they cannot criticizeit. So they hold back the goods,'' he said.   The autumn edition of the biannual fair, running Oct. 15-31,``is the first one to be held after the suppression of thecounterrevolutionary rebellion,'' says Wang Pingqing, vice ministerat the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade.   ``It is a window showing China's determination to carry on itsopen-door policy,'' he says. ``Counterrevolutionary rebellion'' iswhat the Communist government calls last spring's pro-democracydemonstrations.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people, were killed when theChinese military crushed the Beijing protests in early June. Thecrackdown prompted many foreign businessmen to flee the country.   The significance of this autumn's fair may thus be morepolitical than economic.   ``China just wants to show that it is safe to do businesshere,'' said the Hong Kong textile trader, who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   The 156,000-square-yard glass exhibition complex for the fair isnow under tight security, with armed military police guarding thegrounds in this southern city on the Pearl River, about 90 milesnorthwest of Hong Kong.   Inside the five-story building, products ranging from clothingto AK-47 machine guns are on display.   At a medical equipment center, a few people crowded around a``portable hospital'' that takes readings on heartbeat andbreathing. In the toy section, business negotiations took place inrooms lined with dolls and puppets.   The fair's propaganda office claimed 21,000 guests visitedduring the first five days, a 10 percent drop from the springexhibition. China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesdaythat the number of foreign businessmen was greater than theprevious fair without providing statistics.   However, foreign businessmen who attended previous fairs saycrowds are thinner.   ``In the past, it was hard to move around. This year, there arefewer people, especially foreigners,'' the Hong Kong textile tradersaid.   Also, the number of Chinese exporters appears to have dropped assome companies that traditionally exhibit have stayed away as partof the country's economic austerity program that began last year.   Fair officials claim that transactions in the first five dayswere $800 million, up 14.6 percent from the same period of thespring gathering. However, it is not clear whether all of thosewere negotiated after the June crackdown.   A Hong Kong garment merchant claimed that ``the entire fair isjust a show. Deals are negotiated beforehand. They (traders) justgo there to sign the contract so that the Chinese side can have afigure to give to the government.''   The Canton Trade Fair began in 1957, when Communist China hadfrosty relations with the Western world. It was the only eventorganized by China for Western businessmen to shop for Chinesegoods.   In the past decade, China has opened its doors to the West underleader Deng Xiaoping's modernization program. Western businessmenhave been allowed to negotiate directly with Chinese enterprisesand to set up offices in China, diminishing the importance of thefair.   Some of the foreign merchants at the fair said business must goon despite the crackdown on dissent.   ``Trade is trade. The government can do anything. It is not mybusiness,'' said Japanese businessman Zigumi Onodera, who hastraded with China for 13 years.   Although his sales of chemical materials to China have declined30 percent compared to a year ago because of the country's foreignexchange shortage, Onodera said he planned to attend the fair everyday.   ``China is the world's biggest market,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
