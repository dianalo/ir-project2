The Departmentis now issuing its regulation in final form. Notwithstanding the lack ofpublic comment, there are a few minor changes from the proposed rule. Theseare generally due to alterations in the model regulation for implementingthe Act prepared by an interagency task force formed by the Departmentof Health and Human Services at the request of the President's Councilon Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE). As mentioned in the preamble to the proposed rule, the PCIE's request wasin keeping with the statement of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committeein its report on the Act that the committee ``expects that [agency] regulationswould be substantively uniform throughout the government, except as necessaryto meet the specific needs of a particular agency or program.'' S. Rep.No. 99-212, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1985). The Department is followingthe model regulation except in a small number of minor respects. While the Department received no comments, other Federal agencies havepublished substantially identical proposed regulations and received a smallnumber of comments. Representatives of the Department of Transportationand other agencies, through the interagency task force, participated inassessing two of these comments (a set of comments from the Section ofPublic Contract Law of the American Bar Association and a comment from13 States), and making a few changes to the model regulation as a resultof these comments. The more noteworthy changes from the proposed rule, both ones due to changesin the model regulation and one other made by the Department, are discussedbelow. The changes to sections discussed below are due to changes to themodel regulation resulting from the Section of Public Contract Law's commentsto other agencies. The addition to the definition of ``representative''in andSection; 31.2, which clarifies the intent of the definition, was madeon the Department's own initiative based on a Section of Public ContractLaw comment. For a fuller discussion on the comments from the Section ofPublic Contract Law, see, for example, the preamble of the final regulationof the General Services Administration (52 FR 45183, Nov. 25, 1987). The comment from the 13 States objected to including States in the regulatorydefinition of ``person.'' In response, the model regulation was changedto reiterate the statutory definition. The definition of ``person'' inthe Department's proposed regulation (andSection; 31.2) followed this reviseddefinition and remains unchanged. In andSection; 31.2, the Department clarified the definition of ``benefit''to restrict the definition to application in the context of ``statement.''In the same section, the Department also added language to the definitionof ``representative'' to indicate that the requirement that a ``representative''be a member of the bar is not intended to prevent an individual from appearingfor himself or herself, or a corporation or other entity from appearingpro se by an owner, officer, or employee of the corporation or entity.In andSection; 31.5(b)(6), the regulation continues to require that the reviewingofficial's notice to the Department of Justice of intention to issue acomplaint include a statement that there is a reasonable prospect of collectingan appropriate amount of penalties and assessments. However, the Departmentdeleted the final sentence of the proposed regulation, which provided details,as unnecessary and covering a matter best left for the Department and theDepartment of Justice to resolve. In andSection; 31.8, the Department clarified the regulation to indicatethat service of a <T3>complaint</T3> is complete upon receipt, either through the mail asevidenced by an acknowledged return receipt card or by delivery as attestedto by the person who made delivery or who received the complaint. Serviceof an <T3>answer</T3> (andSection; 31.9) is complete upon proper mailing or delivery.In andSection; 31.9, the Department added a new paragraph (c) that providesthat a defendant may file within 30 days of receipt of the complaint arequest for an extension for up to an additional 30 days to file a completeanswer. For good cause shown, the ALJ may grant the request. The purposeof this change is to give the defendant who is unable to file a completeanswer on time and who can show good cause for needing more time a mechanismfor obtaining an extension. In andSection; 31.39, the Department changed paragraph (b) to provide thata defendant may file a notice of appeal at any time within 30 days afterthe ALJ issues a decision, but that if another party files a request forreconsideration in accordance with andSection; 31.38, action on the appealwill be stayed automatically pending disposition of the motion for reconsideration.This change gives the defendant a full 30 days to file a notice of appeal.Except as modified above, the rationale for the Department's rule as discussedin the preamble to the proposed rule continues to apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires the Department to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any major rule. A major rule is definedas any regulation that is likely to: (1) Have an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The Department has determined that these regulations do not meet the criteriafor a major rule as defined by section 1(b) of Exectutive Order 12291.In general, the rule will establish procedures governing the scope andconduct of administrative adjudications to impose civil penalties and assessmentsupon persons who submit false claims or statements. As such, this rulewill have no direct effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures.Consequently, the Department has concluded that a regulatory impact analysisis not required.Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and ProceduresBecause this rule will affect all Departmental administrations and provideimportant new tools for combating fraud in Departmental programs, it isa significant rule under the Department's regulatory policies and procedures.Hower, because the rule's economic impacts will be minimal, it has beendetermined that a regulatory evaluation is not needed.Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisConsistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354,5 U.S.C. 604(a)), the Department prepares and publishes a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for regulations unless the Secretary certifies that the regulationwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall business entities. The analysis is intended to explain what effectthe regulatory action by the agency would have on small businesses andother small entities and to develop lower cost or burden alternatives.As indicated above, these regulations will not have a significant economicimpact. While some of the penalties and assessments the Department couldimpose as a result of these regulations might have an impact on small entities,the Department does not anticipate that a substantial number of these smallentities would be significantly affected by this rule. Therefore, the Secretarycertifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction ActUnder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget for reviewand approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirements contained in bothproposed and final rules. The Department has determined that this ruledoes not contain any information collection requirements and would notincrease the Federal paperwork burden on the public and private sector.Effective DateThe Act, which became law on October 21, 1986, requires the promulgationof final implementing regulations within 180 days of enactment. The Departmentfinds good cause to make the final rule effective immediately based onthis statutory deadline, the public interest in not further delaying therule's remedies for fraud against the Government, the fact that this isnot a major rule under Executive Order 12291, and the absence of any commentson the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 31</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Investigations, Organizationsand functions (Government agencies), Penalties.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on January 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jim Burnley,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Transportation.</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, the Department of Transportation addsa Part 31 to Title 49, Subtile A, of the Code of Federal Regulations, toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 31_PROGRAM FRAUD CIVIL REMEDIES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.1  Basis and purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.2  Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.3  Basis for civil penalties and assessments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.4  Investigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.5  Review by the reviewing official. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.6  Prerequisites for issuing a complaint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.7  Complaint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.8  Service of complaint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.9  Answer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.10 Default upon failure to answer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.11 Referral of complaint and answer to the ALJ. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.12 Notice of hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.13 Parties to the hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.14 Separation of functions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.15 Ex parte contacts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.16 Disqualification of reviewing official or ALJ. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.17 Rights of parties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.18 Authority of the ALJ. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.19 Prehearing conferences. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.20 Disclosure of documents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.21 Discovery. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.22 Exchange of witness lists, statements, and exhibits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.23 Subpoenas for attendance at hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.24 Protective order. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.25 Fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.26 Filing, form, and service of papers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.27 Computation of time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.28 Motions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.29 Sanctions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.30 The hearing and burden of proof. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.31 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.32 Location of hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.33 Witnesses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.34 Evidence. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.35 The record. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.36 Post-hearing briefs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.37 Initial decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.38 Reconsideration of initial decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.39 Appeal to authority head. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.40 Stays ordered by the Department of Justice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.41 Stay pending appeal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.42 Judicial review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.43 Collection of civil penalties and assessments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.44 Right to administrative offset. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.45 Deposit in Treasury of United States. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.46 Compromise or settlement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">31.47 Limitations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 31.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Basis and purpose. </ITAG>(a)<T3> Basis</T3>.
