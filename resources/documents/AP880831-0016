The blueprint is a book blessed by Fleet Adm. Sergei Gorshkov,known as the ``father'' of the modern Russian navy. It envisionssubmarines that can travel at 50 knots to 60 knots underwater ``inthe near term'' and ultimately up to 100 knots, while diving todepths of 6,600 feet and carrying thermal-and laser-homingtorpedoes that can travel at 300 knots.   The book, ``The Navy: Its Role, Prospects for Development andEmployment,'' was published in Moscow earlier this year and is nowbeing translated and analyzed by the U.S. Office of NavalIntelligence.   That office already has prepared a three-page summary, however,that concludes the book ``in its scope is the most powerful Sovietmonograph on the navy since Gorshkov's `Sea Power of the State' (in1976) and is clearly intended to demonstrate why the Soviet navymust continue the Gorshkov legacy of fielding a high-technology,high-seas navy despite evident fiscal constraints.''   The book apparently was authored by several individuals but wasedited and carries a foreword by Gorshkov, for three decades thedriving force behind the Soviet navy.   According to the Navy intelligence office, the book ``offers theWest an insight into the future composition and employment of theSoviet navy,'' highlighting ``three key naval missions.''   They include hunting and destroying U.S. and other Westernsubmarines before they could launch their missiles in a war;destroying Western military and economic targets through nuclearstrikes from Soviet submarines; ``and destroying hostile navalforces to gain command of the sea around the Eurasian periphery.''   Throughout the book, special attention is given toanti-submarine warfare and the threat posed by American subs, thesummary continued.   ``The authors project a highly dynamic undersea warfareenvironment with goals of 2,000-meter (6,600 feet) diving depths;high-speed submarines, 50 to 60 knots in the near term and 100knots in the out-years; future high-speed torpedoes, 200 to 300knots, with thermal and laser homing; 50-kilometer (30-mile)anti-submarine warfare missiles; and improved acoustic andnon-acoustic submarine sensors.''   A knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour, meaning the submarinesultimately envisioned by the Soviets would be able to travel 115mph.   The Soviet Union already has the fastest nuclear-poweredsubmarines in the world; its Alfa and Akula attack subs can exceed40 knots underwater. The U.S. Navy in the past has deliberatelyeschewed the goal of building faster submarines, preferring insteadto emphasize quiet operation.   As for the ``strike mission'' of attacking Western targets withsubmarines, the book makes ``specific reference to `covert launchesfrom short ranges against targets and areas covered by anti-missiledefense systems' in order to decrease reaction time and increasemissile survivability,'' the summary said.   ``Such comments highlight the potential importance of recentSoviet sea-launched ballistic missile launches to test short-range,short time-of-flight trajectories.''   The book appears to be ``the Soviet navy's first salvo instaking out its future role in Soviet national security policyunder the newly proclaimed defensive doctrine and `reasonablesufficiency' philosophy,'' the American analysts added.   Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev and top Soviet defenseofficials have insisted to U.S. officials in recent months thatthey are shifting their military orientation from an offensive to adefensive stance and intend to maintain only a force that issufficiently large for protection.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has pressed the Soviets formore details of their plans in several high-level meetings whileexpressing doubts the Soviets are really changing theiroffensive-minded doctrine.   The new book reflects the current Soviet emphasis on defense bydevoting ``considerable attention ... to the defensive roles of theSoviet navy,'' the summary said.   The book says, though, that ``naval force composition is likelyto continue to emphasize nuclear submarines both for defensiveanti-submarine warfare missions and strategic nuclear strike.''</TEXT></DOC>
