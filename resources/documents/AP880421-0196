The plastic gun bill, aimed at stopping terrorists at airports,went to the full Judiciary Committee. The panel could consider thelegislation next week.   The legislation defines a plastic gun as one containing lessthan 3.7 ounces of metal. Rep. William J. Hughes, chairman of thesubcommittee on crime, said the metallic content was set at anamount that can trigger alarms on today's magnetometers.   He said the standard was agreed upon by the departments ofjustice, treasury, transportation and the law enforcement community.   The bill also would require firearm components to generate X-rayimages which accurately depict the shape of the components.   ``There is no question but that such firearms, once perfected,will become the weapons of choice for terrorists and criminals, andpose an unnaceptable threat to the national security and publicsafety,'' Hughes said.   The bill would make it a federal offense to knowinglymanufacture, import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm,with maximum punishment of five years imprisonment. There alsocould be fines of up to $250,000 for an individual and $1 millionfor an organization.   Rival legislation would require that guns be detectable, butcalls for no minimum metal content. That legislation is supportedby the National Rifle Association.</TEXT></DOC>
