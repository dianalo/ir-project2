The Foreign Ministry said that 382 million yen in grants would go to Saudi Arabia and 290 million yen will be given to Kuwait.    &quot;Under the strained situation in the wake of the Iran-Iraq war . . . it is becoming an imminent issue to ensure the safety of navigation of the shipping from the humanitarian standpoint and for the stability in the region,&quot; a ministry statement said.    Japan's decision followed consultations with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council comprising Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It is expected that similar navigation systems will be set up with Japanese aid in other council states, local news reports said.    Japan imports about 55% of its oil from Persian Gulf states. Several of its tankers have come under attack in the eight-year-old Iran-Iraq war. </TEXT></DOC>
