Democratic reaction is sure to be harsh. Though the budget proposes defense increases that are much more modest than those sought in previous years, it still cuts deeply into domestic spending programs and proposes selling a host of government assets -- much of which the Democratic majorities in both chambers are unwilling to do.    White House officials appeal to GOP legislators for extra support, and aides to Sen. Domenici, often a Reagan budget critic, say his approach will be milder than usual. &quot;Initially, we're not going to be critical,&quot; says a Domenici aide. Indeed, the senator plans to laud the president for hitting the Gramm-Rudman target of a $108 billion deficit.    But Democratic House Budget Chairman Gray says that &quot;many economists&quot; believe $135 billion would be a more realistic deficit target for fiscal 1988.    ETHNIC TENSIONS worry Soviet military and economic leaders.    Declining Russian birth rates and rapid population growth in the Central Asian republics concern Soviet planners, who see a 21st century in which most enlisted soldiers are ethnically non-Russian Moslems. The trends also raise questions about how far Moscow will be willing to decentralize authority as part of an economic reform.    U.S. analysts believe the Soviets were shocked at the riots in Kazakhstan after the native party boss was replaced by an ethnic Russian. The Kazakhs had been considered among the most cowed of the Central Asian nationalities. &quot;Nobody in the field would have guessed the Kazakhs would have been capable of this kind of activity,&quot; says Columbia University's Alexander Motyl. &quot;That must worry the Russians.&quot;    PARTISAN TENSIONS rise over handling Congress's Iran scandal probes.    Outgoing Senate Intelligence Chairman Durenberger and other Republicans push for a broad report on the scandal soon, so the GOP can get the issue behind it quickly. But Democrats say such a report may extrapolate too much from the limited testimony and information available so far.    Democrats also say hasty conclusions in the Intelligence report will make it harder for the Democratic-majority select committees to conduct their inquiries. The panels are expected to have a broad scope, but may face GOP pressure to set a termination date. &quot;There's a clear consensus that we should move as fast as possible consistent with conducting a thorough inquiry,&quot; Democratic Sen. Mitchell says.    The House and Senate panels are fearful of seeming to compete for attention in hearings. One scenario calls for them to meet on alternate days.    ABSHIRE'S APPOINTMENT as White House crisis manager on the Iran scandal is greeted skeptically by congressional Democrats, who view him as a political partisan. While NATO ambassador, Abshire signed a letter endorsing Sen. Jesse Helms's 1984 reelection. &quot;He's going to have credibility problems up here,&quot; an aide to one Democratic senator says.    SENATE DEMOCRATS on the Foreign Relations Committee will move quickly to prepare two unratified nuclear-test treaties for a vote before the end of January. Incoming majority leader Byrd sees arms control as the easiest area for the Democrats to make a fast impression in foreign policy.    PENTAGON PRESSURES grow for an Army decision on a new air-defense weapon to replace the ill-fated Sgt. York. A choice is sought by late 1987, but such a timetable means that the only two U.S.-made candidates could lose out to European competitors; Congress is likely to urge some easing of the schedule.    NORTH'S CREDIBILITY comes under question. The former NSC aide falsely claimed that he served two tours in Vietnam and that he was a pre-med student before entering the Naval Academy. He had also told NSC colleagues he held Iranians captive in Europe, to be exchanged for U.S. hostages. And officials can't verify his claim that funneling Iran arms profits to the Contras was Israel's idea.    REPUBLICANS BRACE for unaccustomed campaign-spending austerity.    The party's House campaign committee income sags badly; it laid off 22 employees the week before Christmas and begins 1987 more than $3 million in debt. Its Senate counterpart goes $2 million in the red, and experts say income probably will plunge dramatically for 1988. Reagan's Iran troubles are sure to add to the committees' money woes.    Experts say the GOP's big list of small givers has stopped expanding, while &quot;donor burnout&quot; has set in from too many mailed requests. Party moneymen plan to lean more on wealthy donors, but many are bitter that their money didn't prevent a Senate debacle. Some complain that $10 million spent on high-tech voter turnout was wasted.    Sen. Boschwitz, the new chairman of the Senate committee, makes his own job tougher by blaming GOP losses on &quot;too much money.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Ann Lewis, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, says of George Bush: &quot;I'm starting to miss him already.&quot; . . . Some wags suggest the ultimate Ronald Reagan movie: &quot;Iranbo!&quot; . . . A new slogan appears on T-shirts in Tulsa following the government's bailout of Bank of Oklahoma: &quot;Live on the edge: Bank in Oklahoma.&quot;    (Revised WSJ Jan. 5, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
