Ginn, to succeed Donald E. Guinn as chairman and chief executive officer.    The 51-year-old Mr. Ginn was heir apparent at the regional Bell company since September, when his boss announced plans for early retirement at age 55. At that time, he took on the post of president and the newly created job of chief operating officer and started shaking things up.    Both men have about three decades of seasoning in the Bell system, but Mr. Ginn spent the past several years outside the San Francisco-based company's conventional, regulated telephone business. He is viewed as decisive, aggressive and unconstrained by the traditional Bell culture.    &quot;Some of our people haven't been able to cope with this new, competitive environment,&quot; says a Pacific Telesis executive. &quot;The ones who can't adapt have been getting out.&quot;    Mr. Ginn was the chief architect of the company's unregulated, or non-telephone, operations -- a hotbed of marketing battles, fast deals and tough negotiations. His challenge is to instill a new attitude into its regulated telephone operations, which insiders and industry analysts say cling to vestiges of monopoly thinking.    &quot;Everyday we face tough competition in every one of our businesses,&quot; says Barry Lewis, a vice president of a Pacific Telesis subsidiary who has worked closely with Mr. Ginn. &quot;As we look at our regulated businesses, they're being inundated with competition.&quot;    Wall Street traders seemed pleased by Mr. Ginn's selection. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pacific Telesis closed at $28, up 75 cents.    Phil J. Quigley, president of the company's Pacific Bell unit, worked for Mr. Ginn in the unregulated operations. He predicts the new chairman will &quot;inject a more unstructured, entrepreneurial attitude&quot; to the telephone business. &quot;He'll meld the two cultures together.&quot;    The need for such a melding is urgent. With the coming of the so-called information age, the company's telephone operations must compete head-to-head with enhanced-service companies, providers of such services as voice mail, electronic mail and specialty data processing through telephone lines.    &quot;The whole industry is moving into a competitive posture,&quot; Mr. Ginn said Friday, shortly after his promotion was announced. &quot;Pacific Bell is changing, and it'll have to change more.&quot;    Mr. Ginn says one of his priorities is to upgrade the company's telephone network so it can offer a wide range of enhanced services. To build those capabilities, he says, Pacific Telesis will spend a lot more money on its network, but he declines to specify how much.    Since becoming president last September, Mr. Ginn has flexed his management muscle. He ordered the Pacific Telesis computer-store business to retrench, sold off the company's unprofitable computer-maintenance operations and renegotiated a marketing venture with Northern Telecom Ltd. on more equitable terms.    Now he says he's looking to chip away at regulatory ceilings on telephone revenues, trim company costs and diversify further, perhaps through acquisitions.    While head of the company's unregulated business, PacTel Corp., which includes one of the largest cellular-telephone operations in the country, Mr. Ginn was known for shunning formal meetings and making up his mind fast. Subordinates say he also liked to play devil's advocate. They recall his shouting and pounding the table as he raised arguments against their proposals to make sure they really believed in them.    Once Mr. Ginn abruptly changed his work schedule to squeeze in a meeting on a proposed cellular acquisition. Pacific Telesis and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. were vying for a lucrative cellular business in Detroit, and at the moment McCaw had the upper hand. &quot;He raised our offer,&quot; recalls Mr. Lewis, &quot;and we had an agreement within an hour.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
