France's pledge is the second among the four European governments that have been asked to assist the European aircraft consortium. The West German and Spanish partners are still negotiating with their respective governments to get funds.    The French money earmarked for the development of the medium-range A-330 and long-range A-340 airliners falls far short of the $1.7 billion that Aerospatiale and the state engine maker, Societe Nationale d'Etude andamp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, or Snecma, had sought.    Last week, the British government pledged to give $755 million to British Aerospace PLC, another member of the Airbus group. That, too, was less than the $1.26 billion that British Aerospace had requested.    Aerospatiale and Snecma -- like British Aerospace -- will repay the aid by a levy on each Airbus plane sold. That is less of a burden on the manufacturers than a straight loan with a fixed repayment schedule.    The U.S. has objected to European governments' assistance to Airbus, as the group increasingly is challenging U.S. makers. Airbus has said it expects to sell 1,000 of the new planes, representing total revenue of about $80 billion.    It isn't clear when Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., the West German Airbus partner, will reach an agreement with Bonn. Informally, the company has asked the German Finance Ministry for some $3.92 billion in subsidies.    The Spanish share of the project is a relatively minor 4%, and the status of those talks is unclear.    Aerospatiale, which assembles Airbus planes at its plant in Toulouse in southwestern France, will receive state aid of $816.8 million, while Snecma will be given $161.3 million, according to the statement from the premier's office.    The overall development costs of the Airbus A-330 and A-340 are estimated at between $3 billion and $4 billion. Industry officials estimate that the French aid represents about 60% of the French share of development costs for the twin-jet A-330 and the four-engined A-340. The planes are expected to enter service in 1993 and 1992. </TEXT></DOC>
