Toshiba also makes most of theother components of the system, giving them a clear advantage over a companysuch as Sun that buys all the components from outside vendors.andM;Sun is pitching the Toshiba deal as a sign that SPARC-based machines willenter the PC market.andP;  Indeed, the Toshiba machines may provide the hardwareand distribution channel to make that possible.andP;  However, the softwarebarrier remains.andP;  Sun hopes that the existence of system vendors such asToshiba will encourage PC-based software vendors to port their applicationsto SPARC-based UnixandM;Gain One, Lose One?andM;While Sun has gained a new licensee with Toshiba, there are persistent rumorsthat ATandamp;T is having second thoughts about building SPARC-based systems.andO;Development of such systems is said to have been on hold for many months,while ATandamp;T evaluates the 88000, i860, and 486.andP;  Sun's competitors claim thatATandamp;T is only one of several companies that have publicly endorsed SPARC, butare privately examining other options.andM;It is striking how much chip design activity is underway for SPARC, yet onlySun and Solbourne are shipping systems.andP;  Either a flood of new systems willbegin shipping over the next year, or there are going to be a lot of unhappychip vendors.andM;BIT SPARC Chips Due; BIT MIPS TooandM;Bipolar Integrated Technology is expected to announce their ECL SPARC chipset early this month.andP;  While BIT's SPARC effort has been well-publicized, itis not widely known that BIT is also developing an ECL MIPS processor.andO;Called the R6000, BIT is developing this chip under contract to MIPS ComputerSystems, and unlike their ECL SPARC chip, BIT does not have the right to sellit to other customers.andP;  NEC has announced that they will produce an ECLversion of the MIPS processor early next year; it is not clear if this designwill be derived from the work done at BIT.andP;  It will be very interesting tocompare BIT's SPARC and MIPS chip sets, since both are designed using thesame technology, by the same company, at roughly the same time.andM;88000 Gains Military Alternate SourceandM;Motorola has announced a strategic partnership with French defenseelectronics company Thomson-CSF.andP;  Thomson-CSF will build future military anddefense products using the 88000, and has been licensed to manufacture the88100 CPU and 88200 CMMU.andP;  They are allowed to sell the chips on the openmarket only in a military version, however, keeping the commercial marketcaptive for Motorola.andM;IBM Finally Introduces SX MachineandM;IBM finally introduced the long-rumored Model 55 386SX-based computer.andP;  Thereare no surprises in the product itself.andP;  The pricing is surprisingly low,however -- at $3895 with a 30 MByte hard disk and 2 Mbytes of RAM, the listprice is only $650 more than a 10-MHz 286-based Model 50Z with the same diskand only 1 Mbyte of RAM.andP;  This makes it clear that IBM wants to encouragecustomers to move to the 386SX, and the Model 50Z should begin dying out.andO;The extra $650 buys a performance boost due to the increase in clock rate,another megabyte of RAM, and the ability to tap into 32-bit software.andM;Many 386SX machines have carried high prices that bear no relationship totheir cost (relative to 286 machines), but are simply an attempt by systemvendors to get better margins than they have had for 286 systems.andO;Competition should eventually drive 386SX system prices down to within $200of 286 systems.andM;Several columnists in personal computer publications just don't seem tounderstand the 386SX.andP;  They claim that it has no place, and point out thatsome &quot;real&quot; 386 (386DX, as Intel would say) machines cost no more than other386SX machines.andP;  These are meaningless, apples-to-oranges comparisons.andP;  Theinevitable fact remains that the production costs for a 386SX-based machinewill be significantly less than for a 386DX-based machine.andP;  We expect386SX-based machines to largely replace 286-based machines as the mainstreamPC product over the next few years.andM;Intel Veterans DepartandM;We don't intend to take over the role of the late Don Hoefler'sMicroelectronics News, but the flurry of recent personnel changes seems to beof some significance.andP;  Gene Hill, who was project leader for the 8051 and ledthe development of the 286, 386, and 486, left Intel to join LSI Logic as themanager of their newly formed SPARC division.andP;  He now reports to Brian Halla,who left his position as Intel's Director of Marketing for the microprocessorgroup last fall to become VP of LSI Logic's microprocessor division.andM;The fact that these Intel veterans saw fit to join the upstart SPARC and MIPScamps doesn't necessarily reflect negatively on Intel, but is a sign that theopportunity to build new businesses lies with these new architectures.andP;  LSILogic seems quite serious about being a player in the microprocessorbusiness, and it appears that they now have the talent they need.andM;Jack Grimes, another long-time employee, also recently left Intel.andP;  Grimes,who was Strategic Marketing Manager for Intel's graphics products, has joinedMass Microsystems (Sunnyvale, CA), a maker of video cards and SCSI disks forthe Macintosh, as VP Engineering.andM;Meanwhile, National Loses 32000 ChampionsandM;National Semiconductor's recent reorganization effectively disbanded the32000 development group, and in the past few months, many of the key membershave departed.andP;  David Schanin, formerly Technical Director for 32000 R andamp; D,and Rich Billig, formerly Director of Value-Added Marketing for the 32000family, have left to form a new product development and consulting firm,Bayview Technology Group (San Carlos, CA).andP;  Don Alpert, the chief designer ofthe 32532, has gone to Intel.andP;  Paul Borrill, best known as the champion ofthe Future-bus, has left National for Sun Microsystems.andM;It now appears that the rumored 32764, an enhanced version of the 32532 witha 64-bit external data bus, will never see the light of day.andP;  National haslargely abandoned the general-purpose computing market to focus on embeddedcontrol.andP;  The 32764 was originally targeted at high-performance Unix systems,and is inappropriate for the embedded market.andM;Apologies to InmosandM;In last month's article on the 68332, we claimed that its 2 Kbytes of on-chipRAM was the most ever included on a microprocessor chip.andP;  Thanks to AndrewAllison for pointing out that the Inmos T800 Transputer has 4 Kbytes ofon-chip RAM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
