The action effectively ends an eight-month battle betweenPresident Bush and environmentalists over the controversial nomineefor assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources andthe environment.   ``Withdrawal of this nomination is a great disappointment,''said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who announced Cason'srequest. ``The lobbying effort against him was both misguided andunfair.''   There was no immediate respones from the White House, whichnever waivered in its support of Cason despite repeated requestsfrom individual senators to withdraw the nomination.   Bush was in Chicago and Rhode Island on Monday, campaigning forRepublican candidates.   Cason was opposed by the Sierra Club, National WildlifeFederation, Wilderness Society, League of Conservation Voters andNational Audubon Society.   The groups alleged that Cason's record in several top InteriorDepartment positions during the Reagan administration showedfavoritism toward private development of public lands, despiteenvironmental concerns.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee, agreed with the environmentalists and worked to defeatCason after his committee sent the nomination to the floor on a12-7 vote.   The Senate, after weeks of behind-the-scenes persuasion by Leahyothers, including Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of theEnergy and Natural Resources, sent the nomination back to the WhiteHouse on Friday and asked that it not be resubmitted.   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested the move after itbecame clear that a floor vote would defeat Cason.   It was the first rejection of a Bush nominee by the full Senatesince John Tower was voted down as defense secretary in March.   ``Since I became chairman in January 1987, the AgricultureCommittee recommended to the Senate the confirmation of 22nominees,'' Leahy said. ``In spite of the fact that I may not haveagreed with the president's choice in each case, I voted for theirconfirmation on the Senate floor.   ``I would have been unable to do so with Cason.''   Leahy said that while Reagan was president, Cason was ``part ofa team that frequently overrode the long-term national consensus toprotect our environment, favoring instead short-term economic gainof a few _ mostly timber, oil and gas interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
