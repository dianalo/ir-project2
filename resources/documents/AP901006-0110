Compatibleequipment, including communications gear, is ``one advantage ofworking with our NATO allies,'' he said.   Britain's 7th Armored Brigade, with about 7,000 troops and 120advanced Challenger tanks, is being shifted from its base inGermany in the biggest movement of British armored forces sinceWorld War II. The unit is named the Desert Rats for its legacy ofbattle in North Africa.   Hamilton, the second-ranking official in the British DefenseMinistry, said he expected the brigade to be in place by earlyNovember, alongside U.S. Marine units that have been in the countryfor six weeks.   U.S. officials here have refused to comment on the arrangement.   Hamilton said the combining of the two forces has been proposedby American commanders, who were ``very glad when they heard the7th Armored Brigade was coming.''   ``In fact, they said they would like to see 7th Brigadeenhancing the capability of the Marines, and that's where we seemto fit in most neatly.''   The Challenger tanks, equipped with 120mm guns and what Britishexperts claim is the world's best armor, are more modern than theMarines' M-60 tanks.   ``It is certainly up to anything that the Iraqis can field. Itis superior to anything the Iraqis have,'' Hamilton said.   He acknowledged the Challenger had been plagued withdifficulties but said there was no basis for reports that theywould be used only as ``static artillery'' to support Marineoperations.   The current British deployment, which includes aircraft,warships and 5,000 personnel, is costing a million pounds ($1.91million) a day and that will double when the armored brigadearrives, Hamilton said.   He said there was ``an argument'' between the Defense Ministryand the British Treasury on how the costs are to be covered, butdiscussions were under way toward getting the Saudi government tounderwrite some of the cost, as it has done with the U.S. forces.</TEXT></DOC>
