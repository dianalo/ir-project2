Maj.-Gen. Jaap Joubert, who leads the investigation ofallegations surrounding the Mandela United soccer team, said thebody found Jan. 7 could not be identified. Team members live at theSoweto home of Mrs. Mandela's, wife of imprisoned African NationalCongress leader Nelson Mandela.   Joubert said the mother of the missing boy, Stompie MokhetsiSepei, recognized bits of clothing and shoes as possibly belongingto her son.   Joubert said forensic and fingerprint experts would make furthertests. He said the exact cause of death was not determined, but theboy appeared to have been stabbed twice in the neck.   The body was found in a field in Soweto, the huge black townshipoutside Johannesburg, after an anonymous telephone call to policeJan. 6. Because of publicity about the disappearance, detectiveswere summoned to the morgue Tuesday to determine whether the bodyfound last month was the missing 14-year-old, police said.   Earlier Tuesday, a Johannesburg newspaper quoted a witness it didnot identify as saying a young man living at Mrs. Mandela's home hadbeen hacked to death in Soweto on Monday.   Police said they were investigating whether a young man founddead of stab wounds Tuesday morning was one of the Mandela Unitedsoccer club members who act as unofficial bodyguards for Mrs.Mandela.   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg said the dead man was MaxwellMadondo, 19, who was staying at Mrs. Mandela's house. The paperquoted another young man, unidentified, who said he witnessed theattack and identified the body.   It quoted him as saying he saw a crowd of youths attack Madondowith pick handles, drag his body into a house and stone him. Theyouth said he then fled the scene, The Star reported.   Allegations were made a week ago that members of the soccer club,who seldom play soccer, abducted three black men and the 14-year-oldlast month.   Their lawyer said the three men have made statements saying Mrs.Mandela was involved in the events on the night they were allegedlyabducted, taken to her home and beaten by members of the soccerclub. The boy, who led a gang of children during the unrest of1984-87, has been missing since the abduction.   Mrs. Mandela has denied being present and has said the soccerclub members took the four from a Methodist Church residence toprotect them from sexual abuse. Community and church committeesinvestigated that explanation and declared it false.   Police said several newspapers received anonymous telephone callsMonday night saying a member of the soccer club had been killed. Abody of a young man was found Tuesday morning in the Orlando Westsection of Soweto, Mrs. Mandela's neighborhood, a post-mortem wasscheduled for Wednesday, they said.   A spokesman said the body was not identified, and police couldnot confirm the man was a member of the soccer club.   Mrs. Mandela had planned to fly to Cape Town on Tuesday to visither husband on a prison farm, but delayed the trip until Wednesday,her office said.</TEXT></DOC>
