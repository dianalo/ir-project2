In a study published today in the journal Science, researchersfrom Maryland, Texas and Utah reported that a gene called p53 tendsto be found in a mutated form in colon cancer tumors.   The discovery eventually could lead to specific tests to detectthe disease before other symptoms occur and while the cancer isstill curable, the study said.   The researchers said they also found that almost all coloncancers lose additional genetic material as the tumors progress.   ``Several genetic changes are probably required for thedevelopment of these cancers,'' said Bert Vogelstein, an associateprofessor at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore.   The report said that 53 of 56 colon tumors excised by surgeryand analyzed showed the loss of genetic material and that patientswith the most genetic changes were those most likely to experiencea return of their colon cancer.   The study said the p53 gene is a suppressor gene that caninhibit tumor growth. Normal cells have two such genes. Coloncancer cells, however, have no normal copies of the gene. One copyis lost and the other is mutated.   Studies suggest that mutation of suppressor genes remove part ofthe body's resistance to tumor growth.   Colon cancer is diagnosed in 147,000 people a year in the UnitedStates, and about 61,000 die of the disease. It ranks second infrequency and death among the types of cancers.   The research for the report was performed at Johns Hopkins, theUniversity of Utah, and at M.D. Anderson Hospital and the BaylorCollege of Medicine in Houston.
