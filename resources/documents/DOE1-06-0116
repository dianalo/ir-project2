The measurement consists in registrationof the wear debris activity in circulating lubricant medium. The methodproved efficient for the wear study of various components of combustionengines. Evaluation of wear was made within the region of proportionalitybetween the thickness of worn-up layer and the measured activity difference.For simultaneous wear study of more irradiated machine parts the spectraof gamma radiation were accumulated by means of a Ge(Li) detector anda MCA system. The dependence of wear rate of various parts on their workingconditions (such as load, type of lubricant etc.) was studied. The testshave been carried out in a cooperation with automobile manufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
