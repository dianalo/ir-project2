The steel and wire maker said that the management group is led by Robert M. Wilthew, president and chief executive officer. The group is offering $18 in cash and $4.50 principal amount of 13% subordinated notes issued by NW Acquisition Corp., a company formed to carry out the transaction, for each of Northwestern's 7,506,339 common shares outstanding.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Northwestern shares closed at $18.25, unchanged.    Last fall, the company's shareholders rebuffed a combination cash-and-note takeover offer from investor Bennett S. LeBow that, prior to the stock market crash, had an indicated value of $172.5 million.    Completion of the sale to the management-led group is subject to certain conditions, including approval of shareholders. The company said that certain holders, controlling about 22% of the shares outstanding, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction, subject to certain conditions.    The buy-out group includes a newly established employee stock ownership plan, covering both salaried employees and workers represented by the United Steelworkers of America, and an investment group including M.J. Rosenthal andamp; Associates Inc., McLarnon Enterprises Inc. and Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp.    Northwestern said closing of the transaction is expected to occur within 180 days.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
