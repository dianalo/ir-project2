(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lost in limbo between the past and thefuture, the tiny town of Locke is quietly decaying on the bank ofthe Sacramento River, a sad footnote in the history of America.   The sagging wood-frame buildings along the block-long Main Streetare the legacy of Chinese immigrants who came to California seekinga better life and found that the quest of the American dream can bea nightmare.   In the '20s and '30s, Chinese villages like Locke _ nowdesignated a National Historic Monument _ housed the laborers whobuilt the levees and tilled the fields of California's upper SanJoaquin Valley.   More than 600 people (mostly men) lived in Locke. Thousands morewould jam the town on weekends, spending hard-earned meager wages ingambling halls, four restaurants, a half-dozen markets and fivebordellos.   The Chinese towns thrived because residents weren't welcome inmost other communities. The Chinese could work 10-hour days in thewhite world for $1 a day or less, but they too often became targetsfor racist attacks at night. The white folks had their towns; theChinese had theirs.   That changed when Japan invaded China and bombed Pearl Harbor.The ensuing war forever changed the status of Chinese immigrants inAmerica. It also marked the beginning of the end for Locke.   After the war, the Chinese were more readily welcomed intomainstream America, opening doors of opportunity leading out of therural ghettos.   Locke, the last rural Chinese town in America, has about 120residents now. Almost all are relative newcomers and only 24 are ofChinese descent. Some work in town or nearby, others are artists andthe rest are retired.   The once-bustling Main Street is now still, except on weekendswhen the curious stop by to visit the art gallery, the curio shopsor the two restaurants. One restaurant is Chinese. The other, whichalso serves as an ersatz town center, is universally known as ``AlThe Wop's.''   Today, only four longtime Chinese residents remain in Locke. Theyare the first to admit they are dying out. Four others have died inthe past year.   ``That's exactly the right word, `dying out,''' says Ping Lee,who at 71 is the youngest of the town's elders. His father foundedLocke, nee Lockeport, in 1915. Lee himself tried to leave Locke, butwas drawn back by his father's business.   ``I saw Locke falling so fast, and the population falling,because the older people are dying off and there are no young peoplecoming on.''   Today, Lee is proprietor of The Big Store market in nearby WalnutGrove, but he still lives in the quiet river town of his birth in ahumble home along one of the town's two back roads.   His neighbor, Tommy King, 75, has lived in Locke since 1927. Heleft only once, to serve in the Air Force as a radio repairmanduring World War II. Before the war, he was a laborer. Even now, thepain of those days is enough to disturb his usually placid demeanor.   ``Ever work for 10 cents an hour? I didn't even get that. Iworked 10{ hours for a buck. During the Depression, it went lowerthan that. It went to 75 cents a day, picking tomatoes. Now,tomatoes are 70 cents a pound. Now you see a dime in the road andyou let it sit there. It's not worth bending over to pick it up.''   King _ whose wife, Connie, runs a gallery on Main Street _ andmost of the other elders, didn't even realize in their youth theywere victims of discrimination.   ``I think I was too young to comprehend what was happening,'' herecalls, sitting in the sun on a homemade bench in the vegetablegarden beside his home. ``We went to segregated schools, and we justthought that's the way it is.''   King and Lee compare the plight of Chinese laborers to thetreatment of Mexican migrant laborers in California today.   ``But actually they're better off than my ancestors,'' King says,``because the Mexicans are protected by law.''   Chinese immigrants were victimized by law. Under the California1913 Alien Land Act, Chinese were barred from owning land. The lawwas not declared unconstitutional until 1952.   Because of that law, Locke was built on a 500-acre ranch owned byGeorge Locke. Although the Chinese built their homes here, they havenever owned the land. Even today, the houses are owned byindividuals, the land is owned by a corporation. But today, thecorporation is owned by Chinese.   The injustices of the past, the ownership of the land, thedesignation of Locke as a national monument and the passing of thetown elders has left the town's residents worried about the future.There is endless debate about what could happen, what will happen,what should happen.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
