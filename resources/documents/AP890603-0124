The rejection came in a communique from the rebels' FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front broadcast on local radio stations.There was no immediate reaction from the government.   Despite their rejection of the offer to talk, the guerrillasalso said Saturday that they lifted a ban on road travel called toprotest the inauguration Thursday of the President AlfredoCristiani.   Cristiani on Friday called for more regional efforts to end ElSalvador's civil war. He said bringing peace to this country wasjust as important as dismantling the U.S.-supported Nicaraguanrebels.   He has pledged not to negotiate changes in the political systemwith the rebels but has offered talks instead on integrating theminto civilian life.   In their statement, the rebels said they stood ready tonegotiate a political solution to their nine-year war against theU.S.-backed government. But they said Cristiani's proposal did notoffer them a chance to do so and that it was an ``invitation tosurrender.''   The rebel communique instead invited El Salvador's politicalparties to sponsor a peace dialogue.   The rebels said the new president had been trying to project``an image acceptable to the United States and the Europeancommunity, but the content of his speech was predominantlyconfrontation, strictly faithful to the politics and economics ofArena.''   Arena is Cristiani's rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.The party takes a hard line on the war, and many observers expectthe fighting to intensify under the Arena government.   About 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have already died in thecivil war.   Cristiani assumed power from President Jose Napoleon Duarte, aChristian Democrat. Duarte is suffering from cancer and has leftthe country for more chemotherapy.   The rebels' traffic ban had paralyzed nationwide traffic sinceWednesday.   ``All highways are reopened to the free circulation ofvehicles,'' said the rebel Radio Venceremos in Saturday'sbroadcast. It said the rebels also ordered all guerrilla units ``tosuspend any further action'' against motorists.   Guerrillas damaged or destroyed five vehicles and dynamitedpower transformers and electrical transmission towers, but noinjuries were reported. The country's 245 gas stations were alsoforced to remain closed for fear of rebel reprisals.   Speaking at his news conference Friday, Cristiani reiteratedaccusations made by Duarte that Nicaragua's ruling leftistSandinista regime was helping the Salvadoran guerrillas. TheSandinistas have often denied such charges, claiming they provideonly moral support.   Cristiani praised a Central American initiative aimed atnegotiating peaceful solutions to conflicts in Nicaragua and ElSalvador. The accords call for demobilizing the Nicaraguan rebels,who now live in border camps in neighboring Honduras.</TEXT></DOC>
