Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a vacuum pipe for use in a synchrotron      orbit radiation device for accelerating and storing charged particles,      e.g., electrons, to generate synchrotron radiation light. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a vacuum pipe of a conventional      synchrotron orbit radiation device described in, for example, pp 9 to 14      of Balker Review vol 14, No. 11. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 3, a charged particle beam, e.g., an electron beam, is deflected      with a deflection center 1 as a center thereof and proceeds on a circular      path 2. A vacuum pipe body 3 is provided such that it surrounds this      electron beam. The vacuum pipe body 3 is made of a thin bellow-type      stainless steel. </PAR><PAR>  A port portion cell 4 is interposed in the vacuum pipe body 3 in such a      manner that it surrounds part of the electron beam path 2. The port      portion cell 4 is also formed of a bellow-type stainless steel, like the      vacuum pipe body 3, but is extended in the outer diameter direction of the      path 2 relative to the vacuum pipe body 3. </PAR><PAR>  The port portion cell 4 has a port 5 through which the synchrotron      radiation emitted by the electron beam is introduced externally. The port      5 is opened in the tangential direction of the path 2. </PAR><PAR>  In the thus-arranged vacuum pipe for use in the conventional synchrotron      orbit radiation device, an accelerated electron beam emits synchrotron      radiation in the tangential direction of the path 2 at the port portion 3      shown in FIG. 3. The generated radiation is externally introduced from the      port 5. </PAR><PAR>  If eddy currents are induced along the metallic wall of the vacuum pipe      during the radial acceleration of the electron beam within the vacuum      pipe, the deflecting magnetic field is adversely affected and the path 2      is made unstable. Most of such eddy currents flow along the path 2. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-described vacuum pipe, since the vacuum pipe body 3 and the      port portion cell 4 are formed by using a bellows made of a thin      non-magnetic material, the resistivity of the wall portion along the path      2 is substantially increased, and generation of eddy currents is thus      prevented. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-described vacuum pipe for use in the conventional synchrotron      orbit radiation device, the vacuum pipe body 3 and the port portion cell 4      are formed by using a welded bellows whose cross-sectional diameter      changes in the direction of propagation of an electron beam. Therefore, as      the electron beam passes, a wake may be formed on the wall portion. The      wake adversely affects the deflecting magnetic field, like the eddy      currents, and makes the path 2 unstable. Furthermore, the formation of a      wake is increased at the port portion cell 4 because it has an increased      cross-sectional diameter. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum pipe      for use in a synchrotron orbit radiation device which reduces the      formation of wakes to make the orbit of a charged particle beam stable. </PAR><PAR>  A vacuum pipe for use in a synchrotron orbit radiation device according to      the present invention uses a vacuum pipe . body whose inner wall surface      is smooth and which has reinforcing ribs on an outer peripheral portion.      An outer diameter side wall of a port portion cell is inclined relative to      an inner diameter side wall in the same direction as a port. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, formation of wakes is reduced by making the inner      wall surface of the vacuum pipe body smooth and by eliminating the      shoulder between the vacuum pipe body and the port portion cell. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plan view of a deflecting portion of a vacuum pipe for use in a      synchrotron orbit radiation device, showing an e of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1A is a cross-sectional view of part of a wall of a vacuum pipe body      of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a plan view of a deflecting portion of a vacuum pipe for use in a      synchrotron orbit radiation device, showing another embodiment of the      present invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a vacuum pipe for use in a conventional      synchrotron orbit radiation device. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with      reference to FIGS. 1 and lA. In FIGS. 1 and 1A, the same reference      numerals are used to denote parts or components which are the same as      those shown in FIG. 3. The cross-section form of the vacuum pipe body and      port portion cell, taken in a direction perpendicular to the orbit of an      electron beam may be elliptical, circular or rectangular. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 1, a vacuum pipe body 11 provided along the path 2 so that it      surrounds an electron beam is made of a thin non-magnetic material (e.g.,      stainless steel), and has a smooth inner wall surface 110. The smooth      surface refers to a surface having no irregularities, unlike the      conventional bellows. A large number of outwardly extending ribs 11a are      provided on an outer wall surface 111 of the vacuum pipe body 11 at      predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction of the body 11 (in      the direction along the path 2) to reinforce the vacuum pipe body 11. Each      of the ribs lla extends along a plane perpendicular to the path 2 over the      entire circumference of the outer wall surface 111. Ribs lla for a port      portion cell 12, which will be described later, are provided similarly. </PAR><PAR>  A port portion cell 12 interposed in the vacuum pipe body 11 such that it      forms part of the path 2 is made of the same material as the vacuum pipe      body 11, and has a smooth inner wall surface, like the vacuum pipe body      11. The port portion cell 12 has a port wall 6 transverse to and extending      from the vacuum pipe body at one end of the port portion cell 12. The      tubular port 5 is mounted on and extends from the wall 6 tangential to the      path 2. Ribs 11a are disposed on the outer wall surface of the port      portion cell 12. A wall 12a of the port portion cell 12 located on the      outer diameter side of the path 2 is inclined relative to a wall 12b      thereof located on the inner diameter side of the path 12 tangential to      the path 2. That is, in this embodiment, the outer diameter wall 12a is      substantially parallel to a center line 5a of the port 5. </PAR><PAR>  In the thus-arranged vacuum pipe for use in the synchrotron orbit radiation      device, since the inner wall surface of the vacuum pipe body 11 and port      portion cell 12 is smooth, the generation of wakes caused by passage of      the electron beam is reduced. Furthermore, since the outer diameter wall      12a of the port portion cell 12 is inclined in the same direction as the      port 5, a rapid change in the cross-sectional diameter between the vacuum      pipe, body 11 and the port portion cell 12 does not occur, also reducing      the generation of wakes. </PAR><PAR>  Consequently, the stability of the path 2 and performance of the      acceleration and storage rings are improved, and reliability of the      synchrotron orbit radiation device is thus improved. Furthermore, since      the welded bellows are not used, the production cost is reduced. </PAR><PAR>  A reduction in the strength of the vacuum pipe body 11 and port portion      cell 12, caused by the smooth wall surface, is compensated for by the      provision of the ribs lla. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, the outer diameter wall 12a of the port portion cell 12      is substantially parallel to the center line 5a of the port 5. However, it      may be smoothly curved toward the port 5, as shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention can also be applied to a vacuum pipe having a      plurality of port portion cells 12 and ports 5. </PAR><PAR>  This embodiment employs, as a charged particle beam, an electron beam.      However, a positively charged beam may also be used. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the non-magnetic material of the vacuum pipe is not limited to      stainless steel. </PAR><PAR>  As will be understood from the foregoing description, the vacuum pipe for      use in the synchrotron orbit radiation device includes a vacuum pipe body      having a smooth inner wall surface and reinforcing ribs on the outer wall      surface thereof, and a port portion cell whose outer diameter side wall is      inclined toward the port 5 relative to the inner diameter side wall      thereof. Consequently, a rapid change in the cross-sectional diameter is      avoided, and the formation of wakes is reduced, thus improving stability      of the orbit of the charged particle beam. As a result, the synchrotron      orbit radiation is improved, the production cost is reduced. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
