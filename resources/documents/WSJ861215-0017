New York-based Pan American Satellite Corp. has proposed launching a 24-transponder satellite into orbit. Initially, only five transponders would be in operation, providing communications between the U.S. and Peru. Transponders on satellites receive and retransmit signals.    Intelsat is a nonprofit, 112-nation cooperative that runs the only world-wide satellite communications network. Before a regional system may go into operation, Intelsat must determine that it won't interfere with Intelsat satellites and won't cause &quot;significant economic harm&quot; to Intelsat.    Intelsat's acting director general, John Hampton, said the proposed Pan American satellite system caused concern because its operation is projected to take away more of Intelsat's revenue -- 0.9% -- than any previous regional network. Further, the satellite will be capable of providing transatlantic service, the source of a large part of Intelstat's business.    Earlier this year, Intelsat's board rejected an attempt to have the Pan American proposal considered, leading critics to say that Intelsat was trying to stifle competition from commercial companies.    It its latest action, taken at a meeting last week, the board recommended that the agency's governing body, made up of representatives from all member nations, give the new system final approval when it meets next March.    At the meeting, the agency's board also established a timetable for the selection of a new director general. Members have been asked to submit nominees to be considered at a special board meeting next February. Officials hope the process can be completed by the end of March.    Earlier this month, the board fired the agency's top two officials over a disputed $1.35 million payment to loan brokers. The Justice Department and an internal Intelsat review board are investigating the payment. The two officials have denied any wrongdoing. </TEXT></DOC>
