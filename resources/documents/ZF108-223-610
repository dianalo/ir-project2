 The XTM machine uses up to 30T800 Transputers from Inmos International Plc (CI No 1,323).andP;  The companybelieves that parallel processing will fill the market niche between thepersonal computer and workstation end of the market and the very highperformance end that includes the world's fastest computers, in price,performance and size.andP;  Computer users are now looking for higher performanceon the desktop.andM;Never imaginedandM;The workstation and minicomputers moved scientific applications onto thedesktop, and although many modern workstations can put 20 VAX MIPS on thedesk this is not enough for many applications such as drug synthesis,economic modelling, decision support systems and computer-aided design.andO;These would benefit from significantly more computing power.andP;  Advances inhardware technologies are increasing the processing performance ofconventional workstations, but there is a limit to the density of chips andat present the high performance computing resources needed by many scientistsand other users are not being provided.andP;  Cogent believes that parallelcomputers enable computing to be used in ways never imagined by the ordinaryperson; processes that are very heavy on computing time and power can now berun economically on the desktop.andP;  Parallel processing is basically sharingwork over several microprocessors working in parallel to increase performancein a small space at a low cost.andP;  However, several issues have hindered theadoption of parallel computers.andP;  It is difficult to structure programs towork efficiently on more than one processor, and strictly sequential taskscannot be implemented on a parallel machine.andP;  The choice of sharing databetween many processors in a common global memory is difficult.andP;  CharlesVollum, founder of Cogent Research believes that the difficulties could beovercome, and that parallel computing seems to be the only way to bringnear-supercomputing performance into the office.andP;  Cogent's technical team hasspent over four years developing a Unix-based operating system, QIX, writtenin C and Linda.andP;  Unix is used as the standard for file service, run-timelibraries, and utilities.andM;By Elvadia TolputtandM;Linda, a parallel communication paradigm developed at Yale University,provides a mechanism for writing parallel programs and the possibility towrite parallel programs that are independent of architecture or topology andthat can be transferred to other parallel computers.andP;  The hardware supportscommunication among the multiple processors and networking between systems.andO;The Cogent Research XTM series is a compact, parallel computer consisting ofa workstation and a server.andP;  The fully configured system can deliver up to160 MIPS and 48 MFLOPS, with 128Mb of memory.andP;  Users that are familiar withwindow-based Unix workstation environments will find it easy to adapt to QIX.andO;It includes Unix-compatible system call supandless;IQ1 kshell command language,utilities for file management and system operation, and the PIX PostScript-and NeWS-compatible window systems.andP;  X Window support is also included.andP;  Allthese facilities are implemented as servers within the QIX operatingenvironment.andP;  It supports C, C++ and Fortran, with parallelism exploitedthrough Linda extensions.andP;  Linda provides a powerful mechanism for writingparallel programs which can be easily moved between other parallel computers.andO;Communications support include Ethernet and TCP/IP network protocols.andP;  TheXTM/QIX environment has multi-user capabilities.andP;  The operating system canautomatically distribute work among processors and allows work to be sharedthrough a network of XTM units.andP;  Customers come from a wide variety ofindustries including aerospace, military and research and development.andO;Applications include signal and image processing, image analysis forsatellite pictures and medical images such as X-rays and three-dimensionalultrasonic images, simulations for financial applications and manufacturingscheduling, and in neural networks and expert systems.andP;  One manufacturer isalready using the parallel computer to replace its VAXcluster for anmanufacturing system modelling.andP;  One buyer has been developing medicalapplications such as while-you-wait analysis for diagnosing problems frommamographs.andP;  X-ray scanning, where the computer will point out the areas thatthe radiographer should focus on.andP;  These images can then be digitised andfiled for future reference and cross referencing and this knowledge could beused to help even earlier detection of problems.andP;  Since the last half of1989, 50 computers have been delivered.andM;Half to JapanandM;Approximately half of these have been purchased by Japanese companies mainlyfor image analysis and manufacturing simulations.andP;  Large corporations andresearch and academic establishments are using the XTM to increaseproductivity, to try new approaches to processing information, and to studyefficiency in parallel programming.andP;  Applications are being programmed by thecompanies and establishments, but by the end of the year Cogent hopes torelease a few vertical market applications and then eventually build onthese.andP;  The system is being marketed in the UK and continental Europe byScientific Computers Ltd, Burgess Hill, Sussex.andP;  Prices start at #18,000, buta typical system will range for #25,000 to #40,000.andP;  Options include digitalaudio tape, 500Mb Winchester disk drives, read-write optical disks whichstore 600Mb on a 5.25&quot; cartridge and nine track magnetic tape.andP;  Trainingcourses will comprise hardware support, parallel programming and systemadministration.andP;  Scientific Computers provide hardware and software,consultancy, training and support in the fields of simulation, knowledgeengineering technology and parallel processing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
