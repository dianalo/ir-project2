(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan 4, America's newest, mostpowerful rocket, blasted off on its maiden flight today, reportedlysending into space a $180 million satellite designed to provideinstant alert of a missile attack.   It was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by theUnited States, with the $220 million rocket, a $45 million satellitebooster stage and other costs raising the total pricetag to close tohalf a billion dollars.   The 20-story-tall booster barreled off its launch pad at 9:18a.m. and spewed a long tail of fire and smoke from its twinsolid-fuel boosters as it dashed out over the Atlantic Ocean.   Ten minutes after liftoff, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Forcelaunch commentator, reported the rocket had successfully drilled itssecret payload into space.   ``This is an important milestone for the Air Force because itsthe first Titan 4, our new heavy lift launch booster, which willgive us assured access to space for our critical heavy nationalsecurity payloads,'' Rand said.   The Titan 4 will be the workhorse as the Pentagon assembles astable of rockets to solve a post-Challenger crisis that has leftabout 40 vital reconnaissance and other military payloadslanguishing in storage for want of a launch vehicle.   The Titan 4 can hoist 39,000-pound payloads to an orbit 150 to300 miles high or propel 10,000-pound packages to stationary orbits23,000 miles up. It replaces the Titan 34D booster, only one ofwhich remains to be launched.   The United States once had a more powerful rocket, the Saturn 5that launched Apollo astronauts to the moon, but it was discontinuedafter the lunar program. It could send a 240,000-pound payload intoorbit.   The space shuttle, by comparison, can lift 55,000 pounds intoorbit.   The new Soviet Energia rocket, the world's largest rocket, hasnearly the power of the Saturn 5.   The Air Force said only that the big rocket was boosting aclassified payload.   However, it has been widely reported that the rocket carried anadvanced missile warning satellite.   ``The satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infraredtelescope to detect an all-out nuclear missile attack on the UnitedStates within a minute of launch,'' said John Pike, associatedirector of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists.   This quick alert would give the president and military units 15minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the Atlanticor Pacific Oceans or 30 minutes for a land-based strike from withinSoviet borders, he said.   ``That would give bombers enough time to become airborne, enoughtime to mobilize our own nuclear forces and enough time to get thepresident into an airborne command post,'' Pike said.   The new satellite offers about the same warning time as olderones, but without such errors as mistaking sunlight glinting offclouds for missile exhaust, Pike said.   The 2{-ton satellite also will provide intelligence on routineSoviet and Chinese missile test firings and will be able to detectthe exhaust heat from military aircraft when they fly with theirafterburners on for extra speed.   Pike said nine of the new satellites will be launched over thenext several years into orbits 22,300 miles high to replace aging,earlier models.   The first of the new rockets had waited a long time for itsmaiden flight. It was moved to the launch pad more than a year ago,on May 15, 1988, to be readied for a liftoff last October. Buttechnical problems caused delay after delay, stretching into monthsand adding millions of dollars to the cost.   Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace is building 23 Titan 4s for theAir Force for $5.1 billion. The two are negotiating another contractfor an additional 26 rockets.   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger exploded in 1986 thatthey were relying too heavily on the space shuttle for vitalmilitary payloads. They more than doubled the number of Titan 4s onorder and authorized development of two new smaller rockets, theDelta 2 and Atlas 2.   The first two Delta 2's launched navigation satellites inFebruary and on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
