To support that premise, you chose to rely onanecdotal information instead of public facts, and whenstatistics were cited, they were old numbers instead ofmore-recent figures.   For example, you implied that natural-gas demand andmarket share are shrinking. In fact, natural-gas demand hasrisen steadily during the past five years -- up 16% from1986. It is also up 7% in the first quarter of 1991 andindustrial and cogeneration usage is leading the way.</LP><TEXT>   You also implied that the natural-gas share of theresidential market is contracting. In fact, governmentstatistics show that since 1985 the natural-gas market shareof new single-family homes has actually risen from 43% to59%. In addition, last year more than 200,000 homeownersswitched from other fuels to natural gas.   As for public image, how can anyone criticize the image ofa product whose economic, environmental and energy-securitybenefits have been acknowledged by everyone from PresidentBush to the Nature Conservancy? In fact, opinion poll afteropinion poll has shown that the general public alsorecognizes these benefits.   No doubt you are correct that some users have had problemswith some vendors. That is true in any industry. The solutionis for natural-gas customers to seek out those firms thatmeet their needs and enter into longer-term contracts fortheir services.   Michael Baly III   President   American Gas Association   Arlington, Va.   ---   You give the natural-gas pipeline industry an undeservedbad rap. Interstate pipelines are highly reliable, as is thegas industry. The culprit is FERC Order 436, issued in 1985and subsequent rules and court decisions that ordered thepipeline companies to transport gas for anyone claiming theability and willingness to pay the pipeline-transportationcosts.   In Order 436, the FERC coined the phrase &quot;Open Access WillProvide a Level Playing Field&quot; for producers, pipelines,customers and gas transporters.   Order 436 was the foundation for destroying historiclong-term sales contracts with the gas-distributioncompanies. FERC voided the contracts with the distributioncompanies and the consumer-oriented Washington, D.C., CircuitCourt supported FERC. At the same time, the producer-inclinedcourts in Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma upheld long-termgas-purchase contracts between producers and the interstatepipeline companies in favor of the producers.   This is the level playing field: long-term sales contractsvoided and long-term gas purchases upheld. There isn't alevel spot that an interstate pipeline company can find onthe proverbial playing field.   S. Orlofsky   Chairman and President   Intercon Gas Inc.   Houston   ---   You paint an unduly gloomy portrait of the industry andits potential. Prices are low now, but it should berecognized that three consecutive warm winters and a stubbornrecession have taken their toll on demand and prices.   We expect to see consistent growth in demand and priceimprovement during the 1990s. Most of the growth of gas usagewill be in the industrial and utility sectors of the economy.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recentlyhas approved several important gas-pipeline projects thatwill make gas more widely available around the country,penetrating new markets on both coasts. The new pipelineswill permit gas to continue to expand in the industrial andelectric markets and capture a greater share of theresidential and commercial markets in the Northeast. Andcompressed natural gas shows considerable promise as analternative motor fuel.   Even though natural-gas prices have been declining inrecent years, the industry has continued to replace reserves.Since the late 1970s, natural-gas availability has improvedwith the addition of industry storage capacity, new pipelineinterconnections and dual fuel (oil and gas) burningcapability in many applications.   If this country wants cleaner air, we can get it byincreasing the use of cleaner-burning natural gas to generateelectricity and to fuel industrial plants. Doing so willavail the U.S. of its own abundant natural-gas resources andreduce our dependence on foreign oil supplies.   T.R. Eck   Chief Economist   Amoco Corp.   Chicago   ---   You explored the paradox of why a fuel that seems to haverelative economic and environmental advantages has only a 24%slice of the energy pie.   A large part of the answer, which you underemphasized, isthat natural gas has been more victimized by regulation thanits rival fuels. Regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938has been the culprit. Wellhead price regulation beginning in1954 resulted in moratoriums on new service and physicalshortages in interstate markets in the 1970s. The Fuel UseAct of 1978 -- restricting oil and gas burning in power plantand industrial boilers -- skewed utility projects toward coaluntil the law was repealed in 1987. Comparative hearings tocertify new projects have delayed much-needed new pipelinecapacity in major markets. Interruptible users desiring firmservice have been unable to contractually secure it.   Regulation has continued gas-market disequilibrium to thisday. The termination of utility/pipeline minimum billcontracts and de facto mandatory contract carriage in thepast six years supercharged gas-on-gas competition. Theresult: Today's gas prices are less than half of their 1983peak adjusted for inflation.   Without regulation, the gas industry would be much moreintegrated (and thus coordinated) from the wellhead to burnertip, the gas price cycle of the past decade would have beenmuch flatter, and the market share of gas would be percentagepoints higher at the expense of coal and nuclear.
