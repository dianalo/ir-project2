In another case involving public criticism of an official, theofficial news agency Tass said the party plans action against twoprosecutors who accused hard-line Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachevof misconduct.   In its apology for the Yeltsin report, Pravda said the reporterwho wrote the story had not seen anything of the kind.   A legislative committee created to serve as a watchdog for thestate media said the account of Yeltsin's purported American bingesmacked of the ``gutter press'' and was unacceptable.   Yeltsin called the piece ``garbage.''   The lengthy expose appeared Monday in Pravda. It was originallypublished by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica and said the Sovietlegislator left behind in the United States ``a wake of catastrophicprophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume ofJack Daniels Black Label.''   The Pravda article was picked up by Tass and distributednationwide. Regional newspapers carried it in full.   A flushed and angry Yeltsin, who returned home Monday from anine-city U.S. tour, accused Pravda of seeking ``revenge for thefact that Americans received us with admiration.''   The Communist Party daily said Thursday it had instructed itsWashington correspondent, V. Linnik, to contact the La Repubblicareporter who wrote the original article, Vittorio Zucconi, and checkits accuracy.   ``Asked whether he stood by the authenticity of everything hewrote about B.N. Yeltsin in his article, Zucconi replied he hadbased it on secondary sources, on a publication that appeared in TheWashington Post Sept. 13 headlined `With Drunken Embraces Toward TheCapitalists' and the testimony of Soviet emigres who heard talk ofYeltsin's conduct in Baltimore,'' Pravda said.   The Pravda editorial board offered its apologies to Yeltsin butappeared to do so only grudgingly.   The reprint of La Repubblica story's was promoted on the frontpage with excerpts saying Yeltsin found the United States ``aholiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.''   The apology was on the bottom of page 7.   Members of the media watchdog committee _ the Supreme SovietCommittee on Glasnost and People's Rights _ accused Pravda ofdeliberately drawing a biased picture of Yeltsin, a deputy in theSupreme Soviet.   The Pravda report apparently did little to dull public enthusiasmfor Yeltsin, who revels in his role as an anti-establishmentgladiator fighting for a better life for average Soviets, though hehimself is a member of the elite Communist Party Central Committee.   On Wednesday night, about 10,000 people rallied in the Moscowsuburb of Zelenograd to show support for Yeltsin and for the twoprosecutors who have made claims of corruption by Ligachev and otherhigh party officials.   In its report on the prosecutors Thursday, Tass said theCommunist Party Central Committee directed its Moscow organizationto take action against the two prosecutors, Telman Gdlyan andNikolai Ivanov.   The two publicly accused Ligachev, Yeltsin's archrival in theSoviet leadership, of involvement in corruption cases they wereinvestigating.   However, the Soviet procurator-general's office cleared Ligachev.   Tass did not say what type of action would be taken against thetwo prosecutors, who have themselves been under investigation oncharges that they forced confessions during their inquiry.   During his U.S. visit, Yeltsin warned Americans that PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev could face a revolution if he fails to improveliving conditions soon.   Yeltsin, the former Communist Party chief of Moscow, was strippedof that post almost two years ago by Gorbachev, who denounced him aspolitically immature and overly ambitious.   In a remarkable political comeback in March, Yeltsin won 89percent of the vote when he ran against an establishment candidateto represent Moscow in the new national legislature, the Congress ofPeople's Deputies.</TEXT></DOC>
