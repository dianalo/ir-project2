The resolution made no reference to Romania's decision this weekto close a Hungarian consulate and expell its staff. It also didn'tmention the order to close a Hungarian cultural center in theRomanian capital.   Matyas Szueroes, head of the foreign relations committee thatdrafted the document, appealed to Hungarians ``not to yield toemotions'' regarding the ``disquieting developments reported fromRomania.''   Hungary maintains the program of moving residents of 7,000villages to new agricultural-industrial centers would destroyethnic Hungarian culture and tradition in Romania. Romania says itwould help villagers by providing services now enjoyed only incities.   Romania's treatment of its 1.7 million Hungarian residents haslong been a sticky issue between the two Warsaw Pact allies.   Hungary claims the Hungarian minority is discriminated against.Bucharest says Hungary's criticism is interference in Romania'sinternal affairs.   Romania on Tuesday closed Hungary's consulate in Cluj inTransylvania, home to most of Romania's ethnic Hungarians, toprotest a demonstration by 50,000 people in Budapest against theresettlement program.   Bucharest also insisted that the Hungarian Embassy move out ofrooms rented for a cultural center.   Official media in Hungary reported that Romanian authoritiesalso were sending back some Hungarian travelers without giving anyreason for the move. A Hungarian border official, who spoke oncondition he not be identified, said today there was no officialban.   The parliamentary document, which is to be sent to the Romanianlegislature, said the beginning of the Romanian program wouldfurther weaken Hungarian-Romanian relations.   The document said Hungary hoped Romania ``would reexamine its... plans and will refrain from their implementation.''   ``This would remove an important obstacle to the rapprochementbetween the Hungarian and Romanian people,'' the document said.   On Thursday, Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz appealed fordialogue with Romania.   Grosz, who is also premier, said the tension was temporary andwarned against drawing long-term conclusions.   He told Western journalists he would go ahead with a plannedvisit to Romania because ``if we don't talk to each other we cannotunderstand each other.''   No date for the trip has been announced, but it is believedGrosz will go to Bucharest after visits in July to Moscow, Warsawand Washington.   On Thursday, a Hungarian diplomat in Bucharest said Romania haddeclared Hungary's cultural center in the Romanian capital closedand ordered the embassy to vacate the building.   The cultural center was never issued a permit to start operationand has been used as a storage for the embassy in recent years.</TEXT></DOC>
