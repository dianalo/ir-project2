The AMA said Monday it has petitioned the Food and DrugAdministration to regulate the nicotine products, introduced lastfall by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and to review their ingredientsand safety before they go on the market.   Dr. Lonnie Bristow, an AMA board member, said nicotine is anaddictive, harmful drug that constricts blood vessels. Because theReynolds cigarette contains nicotine, he said, it should beregulated.   ``It promotes and maintains the nicotine addiction,'' he said inan interview.   ``For those individuals who have vascular disease, it isparticularly dangerous because they may be lulled into thinkingthey are using a safe product,'' he said.   But David Fishel, a spokesman for the company in Winston-Salem,N.C., said court decisions have affirmed that cigarettes do notcome under FDA regulations, and the new product should be in thesame category.   Fishel said the new cigarette, which generates a smaller amountof smoke than regular cigarettes, is being tested and results willbe available to the scientific community before it is test marketed.   ``We think it's a very uninformed, premature attempt to bringabout regulation of a product which they know very little about atthis point,'' Fishel said of the AMA petition.   At a news conference unveiling the cigarette last September,Reynolds Tobacco chairman and chief executive Edward Horrigan Jr.said the company was not claiming the new product was a safe orsafer cigarette.   He said, however, that it eliminated or greatly reduced most ofthe compounds produced by burning tobacco, ``including mostcompounds that are often associated with the smoking-and-healthcontroversy.''   But Bristow, of San Pablo, Calif., said any impression that the``smokeless'' cigarette is better for health is dangerous.   ``It's sort of like saying `We won't have people dying from lungcancer; we'll have them dying from vascular disease'' because ofnicotine's effects, Bristow said. Vascular disease affects thearteries and veins, causing blood circulation problems.   The Reynolds cigarette introduced in September contains tobaccothat is heated, but not burned. Nicotine is delivered to the userthrough a tiny metal capsule which, when heated, produces anaerosol resembling tobacco smoke.   A piece of charcoal in the ``smokeless'' cigarette's end is litand generates the heat, Bristow said.   R.J. Reynolds, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc., of Atlanta,initially indicated it hoped to market-test the product this year.   The AMA petition states that other products with nicotine, suchas gum and a non-tobacco cigarette that produces a nicotine vapor,have come under official FDA scrutiny.   Under federal law, the FDA has six months to respond to the AMApetition. In a related issue, three other health groups asked thegovernment Monday to begin regulating low-tar cigarettes on groundsthat advertising claims for the products make them a drug subjectto federal oversight.   The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association andAmerican Lung Association argued that advertisements pushingcigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine in essense make ahealth benefit claim for those products.   FDA spokesman Bill Gribb said the groups' petition would bereviewed in the next few weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
