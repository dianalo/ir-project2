The basis for resistance to the cytotoxiceffects of this agent remains unclear. We have studied the developmentof TNF resistance in human ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells. ZR-75-1 cellshave undetectable levels of TNF RNA and protein. However, TNF transcriptsare transiently induced in these cells by exposure to recombinant humanTNF. This induction of TNF RNA is associated with production of TNF-likeprotein in cell lysates and culture supernatants. Stable resistance toTNF-induced cytotoxicity develops when ZR-75-1 cells are exposed to increasedconcentrations of TNF. The TNF-resistant cells, designated ZR-75-1R,continuously express TNF transcripts and a TNF-like protein. Furthermore,ZR-75-1R cell supernatants contain cytotoxic activity that is abrogatedby polyclonal antibody against TNF. The ZR-75-1R cells also possess TNFreceptors that are occupied or down-regulated by the TNF-like protein.These findings thus suggest that (i) TNF induces TNF transcripts andproduction of a TNF-like protein in ZR-75-1 cells and (ii) resistanceto TNF-induced cytotoxicity is associated with stable TNF expression.</TEXT></DOC>
