While in the case of experimentalvolume flows of less than 6 m/sup 3//h sudden closing followed by pressuresurges defies the detection of actuators influencing the process, boththe opening of the main shut-off device after longer standstill periodsand the insufficient null balance of gas pressure regulators due to actuatordeposits were found to be possibly causing disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
