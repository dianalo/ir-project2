Although biomass accounted for virtually all the energyused in Canada a century ago, its 1980 contribution is only 4.1% of totalprimary energy demand; over 95% of this use results from the on-siteconversion of waste produced by the forest products industry. However,since Canada's biomass inventory is the third largest in the world, thispercentage can be improved substantially. The amount of this resourcethat could be expected to be available at any one time will depend onthe price paid for its recovery, and an estimate is given of the availabilityof the major types of biomass at costs between $10 and $50 per oven drytonne. Current biomass conversion tecnologies are briefly described.Potential development of Canada's biomass potential is assessed, anda number of government programs established to encourage this developmentare summarized. 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
