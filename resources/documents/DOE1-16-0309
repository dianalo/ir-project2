Lett. 43, 267 (1979)], a large-amplitudeLangmuir wave is produced by the beating of two laser beams whose frequenciesdiffer by approximately the plasma frequency. The relativistic equationsgoverning this three-wave interaction are shown to admit two types ofsolitary-wave solutions. Temporal solitary waves propagate at speedsgreater than the speed of light and carry no information. Spatial solitarywaves propagate at speeds less than the speed of light and do carry information.Analytic expressions are obtained for the envelopes of these waves andfor the relationship between their speed and maximum amplitude. For thelimit in which the propagation speed of the solitary wave is equal tothe speed of light, there is no distinction between a temporal solitarywave and a spatial solitary wave. However, it can be shown that the solitarywave is unstable in this limit. The potential of the spatial solitarywaves for particle acceleration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 57, 1421 (1986)] isstudied. Although the spatial solitary waves are capable of acceleratingparticles to high energy, for typical beat-wave parameters the laser--plasmacoupling efficiency is too low for this scheme to be practical.</TEXT></DOC>
