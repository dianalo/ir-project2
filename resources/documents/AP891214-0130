Under the plan being reviewed by the Immigration andNaturalization Service, work permits issued to aliens applying forpolitical asylum would restrict them from taking jobs in citieswhere there is a glut of cheap labor caused by a largeconcentration of new arrivals.   The work permits ``may exclude Miami or San Diego or areas thatare overrun at the present time'' by aliens, McNary said.   In Miami alone there are 50,000 people, mostly CentralAmericans, seeking refugee status. The large concentration ofwould-be refugees places a strain on the local labor market and oncommunity social services.   McNary said he has asked the INS general counsel to reviewwhether the agency has legal authority to place such restrictionson work permits granted to people who are applying for politicalasylum.   Arthur Helton, director of the Lawyers Committee for HumanRights' refugee project, said restricting work permits would be anunlawful travel restriction under the Constitution and the UnitedNations refugee protocol.   Helton said ``the only humane solution'' is to spend more moneyto hire more INS examiners to speed up the processing. Delays ofmonths and years only encourages people to apply for work permits,he said.   The new immigration commissioner, who took office Oct. 26,acknowledged in an interview with reporters that, ``I don't feel asthough I have control'' of the sprawling agency that has beencriticized for mismanagement.   Some decisions have been made without approval of headquartersbut ``will be brought under our management,'' McNary said.   Under McNary's predecessor, Alan Nelson, INS came under repeatedcriticism for mismanagement and inefficiency. An audit ordered byAttorney General Dick Thornburgh sharply criticized the managementof the agency under Nelson.   While being careful not to criticize Nelson, McNary said: ``I amaware of a number of audits that have been conducted and areongoing. I view that as a benefit.''   The commissioner said he has taken steps to centralize theagency's budget, procurement, hiring and policy development.   The lines of authority must be clarified because ``we havepeople who are taking orders from two different sources,'' McNarysaid.   Because of the diversity of statements by INS officials aroundthe country, McNary said he had ``found myself at a loss as to whatthe policy was'' on certain issues.   ``There is going to be one policy and it's going to beestablished here at the central office,'' said McNary, who lastmonth ordered INS officials to clear public statements withWashington.   The new commissioner said he wants to streamline deportationproceedings, which often take years to complete because ofcumbersome administrative appeals.   ``The way INS handles deportation is absurd,'' he said. ``Anylawyer can kick a case for years.''   McNary said he needed more time to determine whether INS wouldcontinue to deport Nicaraguans who came to this country.   About 70 were deported last spring after a crackdown on theTexas-Mexico border. During an eight-month period, as many as60,000 Central Americans entered this country.   Nicaraguans have enjoyed a special status in the sense that anyINS deportation order is reviewed by a special Justice Departmentunit set up during the Reagan administration.   McNary also said he plans to issue new regulations fordetermining if an alien has a well-founded fear of persecution andis therefore eligible for political asylum.   ``Our adjudicators don't have the training they should have, asa result there may be mistakes made,'' McNary said.   McNary said he had no plans to change the INS policy ofinterviewing Haitians on Coast Guard cutters that intercept boatloads of people headed toward U.S. shores.   McNary said he would not consider conducting the processing ofthese Haitians on U.S. soil because that would mean ``crossing theline of exclusion to deportation and deportation is a majorproblem.''   The Coast Guard intercepts one or two boatloads of Haitians amonth on the high seas. Those refused political asylum by INSinspectors are turned back to their native land, a practice thathas been criticized by groups favoring a more open immigrationpolicy for Haitians.</TEXT></DOC>
