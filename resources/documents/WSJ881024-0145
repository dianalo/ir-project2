The sale would leave BSN with only its sporting-goods catalog business, which has about $40 million in annual revenue. Two years ago, the company was on an acquiring binge, buying a garment unit and the protective equipment and trophy businesses.    Michael Blumenfeld, president, said BSN is selling the units because buyers are offering high prices. He said he would like to make an acquisition but hasn't found an appropriate one.    The transaction is contingent on financing and board approval. Mr. Blumenfeld said proceeds might be used to pay a dividend or might be invested.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, BSN shares closed at $6.625, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
