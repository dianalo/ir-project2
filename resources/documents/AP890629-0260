West Germany's Bundesbank led a wave of rate hikes when itannounced it would raise the nation's discount and Lombard rates bya half a percentage point each, effective Friday, to their highestlevels since the early 1980s.   The central banks of France, Switzerland, Austria and theNetherlands followed suit shortly afterwards by announcing similarrate increases.   The dollar fell sharply in hectic early trading in New York. Thedollar plunged to 1.9465 West German marks, from 1.9620 atWednesday's close, and to 142.45 Japanese yen, down from 143.25 yenin the previous session.   The Bundesbank's hike in the discount rate _ to 5 percent _ putsthe key lending rate at its highest level since early 1983. Thediscount rate is the cheapest form of bank refinancing.   The Lombard rate, the rate at which the Bundesbank lendsshort-term funds using securities as collateral, increased to 7percent, its highest level since 1982.   The Bundesbank said in a statement the move was prompted bystrong economic growth and the potential for rising inflation. Therate increases would aid the bank in stemming money supply growthand would help stabilize the West German mark.   The decision took some market participants in Europe by surprise,but many analysts pointed to comments made last week by BundesbankPresident Karl Otto Poehl as a harbinger that a rate hike was in theoffing. Poehl said West Germany's current economic boom could causea deterioration in German price stability.   In Paris, the Bank of France boosted its benchmark lending rateby a half a percentage point in the country's first credittightening since Jan. 19. The rise will put the money marketintervention rate at 8} percent.   The move had been promised earlier in the day by EconomicsMinister Pierre Beregovoy as part of France's European cooperationstrategy.   Beregovoy stressed, however, that domestic concerns didn't callfor a rate hike. But private economists said the hike was anopportune way for France to curb the rapid expansion of domesticdemand and address its trade deficit.   Separately, the Swiss National Bank announced it would raise thenation's discount rate a full percentage point to 5.5 percenteffective Friday. The increase marked Switzerland's second hike sofar this year.</TEXT></DOC>
