The power is sold toOntario Hydro. The project included a building, a turbine generator,a switch gear package and protective relaying equipment and was completedfor a capital cost of less than $1.8 million. The purpose of the projectwas to make use of the steam generated at the Hamilton plant and to demonstratethe feasibility of electrical power generation from a renewable energysource. Approximately 364 to 455 tonnes of residential solid waste fromthe Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth is burned 3 days perweek at the privately operated incineration plant. More than 45,360 kilogramsper hour of saturated stem is produced as a by product of the combustionprocess. The steam is utilized to operate a 4.2 megawatt turbine generatorequipment package. The resultant electrical energy is fed into the localpower authority grid distribution system. This repot describes the installationand operation of the turbine generator, the plant process, and the economicbenefits of the system. 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
