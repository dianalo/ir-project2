The bill would grant children a scholarship of up to$900 if they wanted to attend a private or nonlocal publicschool. Against great odds, the bill passed the State Senatelast month.   The state's teachers unions have vowed to stop choice.Their lobbying resurrects the usual bogymen and adds theimplied charge that choice is an attempt by the CatholicChurch to spread its beliefs. It would be more accurate tosay that public education as it currently exists divertsschool dollars away from real education and into the pocketsof a growing army of administrators and public teachersunions.</LP><TEXT>   Fred Kingery, a school-board director in Lawrence County,Pennsylvania, gives reasons the typical public school coststwice as much as most well-run private schools. He saysnothing good can come from a system where public schools havean effective monopoly, teachers have a right to strike,collective bargaining is required and 85% of a district'sbudget is mandated by state bureaucrats.   &quot;Teacher contracts only require that teachers provide 185days of instruction, period,&quot; he told us. &quot;That means theycan go out on strike, not lose any pay and we have to cave tothem.&quot; Mr. Kingery's district just granted teachers a 50% payincrease over the next five years. While local teachers nowmake $30,000 a year, he notes &quot;that's for nine months' work,and with lavish benefits they get the equivalent of $53,000for nine months.&quot;   Unionization has also provided teachers with perverseincentives to put their paychecks ahead of education. Lastmonth, teachers in affluent Montgomery County, Maryland,refused to write crucial college recommendations for seniorsunless their parents wrote county officials demanding moremoney for teachers. &quot;We're just saying, `We're going to doyou a favor if you do us a favor,'&quot; said Phyllis Jaworski, ateachers union representative. Similar college-letter tacticshave been used in Chicago and Bergen County, New Jersey.   While the anti-choice arguments of unions are rooted inmoney, others oppose choice for reasons that can be calledelitist. David Boldt, the editorial-page editor of thePhiladelphia Inquirer, wrote last month that &quot;The typicalopponent of choice is a white, self-styled liberal who livesin a section of the suburbs that he or she has chosenspecifically because of its good schools. . . . Yet somehowthey have the incredible brass to suggest that some otherpeople's children should be forced to stay in the publicschools as a sacrifice to some sort of indefinable largergood that they themselves have no interest in directlysupporting. It makes my blood boil.&quot;   The Inquirer still has a few reservations aboutPennsylvania's choice plan. We agree it isn't perfect. The$900 limit will pay only half or a third of the cost of adecent private school. That would leave many low-income kidsout in the cold. Ultimately, a choice plan should grant aG.I. Bill-type scholarship that is closer to the actualper-pupil expenditure of the public schools. A $3,000scholarship would pay for many good private schools and stillsave taxpayers big money. Connecticut now spends an average$7,914 a year on each student, New York spends $8,500annually and New Jersey a whopping $9,159.   Union lobbying may delay choice in Pennsylvania. Butpeople everywhere are realizing that putting more money intothe educational status quo is like pouring gasoline into acar with a bad engine -- it can't take you where you need togo. Choice is the new vehicle that can start getting Americaneducation moving again.</TEXT></DOC>
