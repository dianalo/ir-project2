The $50 million will come from the government's Overseas PrivateInvestment Corporation (OPIC), one of its few profit-makingagencies. For the year that ended last September, the corporationturned over $122 million to the Treasury. It earned the moneylargely by insuring Americans against hostile acts to theirproperty in other countries.   ``For democracy's sake, we've got to do all we can to help thistransition take place,'' Bush told the annual meeting of the U.S.Chamber of Commerce.   Private U.S. investors are expected to supply the remaining $150million. The government corporation will insurethem against havingtheir money blocked or confiscated, and against war and violence inthe countries where the fund will be active.   James V. Hall, the corporation's spokesman, said the fund shouldbe operating in about six months, beginning with help for privateinvestors in Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. Later Czechoslovakia,Bulgaria, Romania and East Germany are expected to become eligible.The Soviet Union is not excluded, Hall added.   He said the fund probably will be managed by a U.S. institution,and will earn 10 to 15 percent a year for investors. The governmentcorporation will not insure the earnings, only the right of theinvestors to take their money back home, Hall explained.   Private companies in the eastern European countries will be ableto borrow from the fund, and it will buy small quantities of theirstock. As a result, the U.S. government will become partial,indirect owner of many private companies in countries which untillast year were under communist rule.</TEXT></DOC>
