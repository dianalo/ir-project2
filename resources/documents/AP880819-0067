Thank you. Thank you very much. (He repeats his thanks severaltimes as the crowd cheers.)   You're great. (He again repeats his thanks as the cheeringcontinues.)   Boy, I can see we're going to have a lot of fun in this campaign.   Thank you very much.   Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, I accept yournomination for vice president of the United States of America.   Just, just think, 82 days from now, George Bush and I are goingto win one for you, win one for America's future, and, yes, win onefor the Gipper.   My friends, I am standing here tonight because of the decisionmade by a great man and a great leader, George Bush.   Two days ago, he asked me if I would join him as his runningmate. I am deeply grateful for George's confidence in me, and I amhumbled by the task ahead.   I would like to add a very personal note. I am also standinghere tonight because of the decision my wife, Marilyn, and I madenearly 16 years ago to be married. Marilyn and our children,Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne, are my strength, my pride, my joy, mylove. They are and always will be my total life.   Many this week have asked, who is Dan Quayle?   The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.   Since 1980, I have been a United States senator from Indiana _and very proud of it. Before that, I was a member of the UnitedStates House of Representatives _ and proud of it. And, as a youngman, I served six years in the National Guard, and, like millionsof Americans who have served in the Guard and who serve today _ andI am proud of that.   In Indiana, in Indiana they call us Hoosiers and if you saw themovie ``Hoosiers'' you have a feeling of what life is like in smalltowns of our state.   My hometown of Huntington is a little bigger than the town inthe movie, and the high school I graduated from is a little biggerthan the one that fielded the basketball team in the film.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
