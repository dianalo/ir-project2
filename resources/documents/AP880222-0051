Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., in an enterpriseapproved by the Commerce Department, will grow protein crystals forU.S. industry with the help of a Soviet cosmonaut who will be givenonly minimal information about the projects, said Anthony Arrott,company research and development director.   Payload Systems received a two-year government license tocontract with the Soviets for protein crystallization productionexperiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, which is alreadyin orbit, Arrott said in a telephone interview Sunday.   ``It's a multiflight, multiyear agreement beginning in 1989,''he said, adding that part of the agreement includes non-disclosureof the amount to be paid to the Soviets who reportedly have offeredto carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and $15,000 akilogram.

Equally troubling, Riley said, is that the federal governmenthas less power to curtail railroad accidents now than it did whenthree Conrail locomotives slid through a warning signal andcollided with an Amtrak passenger train near Chase, Md., on Jan. 4,1987. Sixteen people were killed.   ``It's incredible to me that we're sitting here 14 months afterthe Chase accident and not one shred of legislation introduced inthe wake of that accident has yet become law,'' Riley said duringan interview he requested to talk about safety concerns. ``As themonths pass, I see the opportunity slipping away from us,'' he said.   Riley has been lobbying for measures before House-Senateconference committees that would permit direct government sanctionsagainst railroad workers for safety violations, and authorizerandom drug testing.   Delays in enacting the sanctions measure is ``testimony to thesheer political power of the labor organizations who oppose it,''Riley said. The measure would permit the FRA to suspend theoperating privilege of railroad conductors or engineers.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Last Week's `Face The Nation' Mistakenly Shown on WashingtonStation</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Viewers of the CBS affiliate in the Washingtonarea, may have had a sense of deja vu when WUSA-TV mistakenly beganits ``Face The Nation'' broadcast with last week's preview of theNew Hampshire primary.   Commentator Lesley Stahl started Sunday's show with, ``Welcometo `Face The Nation,' this is Lesley Stahl in New Hampshire,'' andspoke of what would happen in last Tuesday's primary.   The error was not detected until more than five minutes into theshow.   At that point, Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertsonwas talking about prophecies concerning the ``forces of evil'' inthe world and an embattled Israel. The tape was abruptly cut, andthe show picked up with this week's broadcast and Ms. Stahl inmid-sentence asking Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin aboutIsraeli forces being out of control in the West Bank.   Diane Digit, WUSA publicity manager, said as soon as engineersrealized they were mistakenly running last week's show, theyswitched to a tape containing the correct broadcast.</TEXT></DOC>
