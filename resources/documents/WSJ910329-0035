William H. Frey of the University of Michigan and AldenSpeare Jr. of Brown University analyzed growth trends from1960 to 1990. In the 1970s and early 1980s, almost half ofthe fastest-growing metropolitan areas were in Southern andWestern interior areas. In the late 1980s, as in the 1960s,fast growth was once again concentrated in coastal areas,with 69% of the fastest-growing areas along the Southern andWestern coastline.   The fastest metropolitan growth is still concentrated inthe South and West, but its pace has slowed in these regions,especially during the late 1980s. Of the 44 metropolitanareas that grew in the first half of the 1980s but declinedin the second half, 40 were in the South and West.   On the other hand, 18 of the 21 metropolitan areas thatgrew during the second half of the decade after declining inthe first half were in the Northeast and Midwest, includingBuffalo-Niagara Falls, N.Y.; Detroit; and Toledo, Ohio.Several large Northeastern and Midwestern metropolitan areasgained back some of the ground they lost in the 1970s,including New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Milwaukee.   Overall, large Northeastern and Midwestern metropolitanareas with populations of one million or more grew 3% in the1980s, compared with a 1% decline in the 1970s. Even so, thiscompares with a 23% growth rate for large Southern andWestern metropolitan areas in the 1980s.                                                                                                          Grown Children Return   To Flexible Mothers                                                                                                          MORE THAN HALF of today's young adults 18 to 24 years oldlive with their parents. Some have never left the parentalnest; others have returned to refill one. A new study shedslight on the differences between mothers whose childrenreturn and those whose don't.   In 1956, John P. Dean and Robin M. Williams Jr. of CornellUniversity conducted a study of 427 young married mothers inupstate New York. At that time, the women were asked abouttheir attitudes toward being mothers, the importance offamily to their happiness and other related questions. Thirtyyears later, in 1986, Joyce Munsch of Texas Tech Universityand several colleagues found 326 of these women to learn howmany had had children return home and why.   Nine out of 10 mothers had experienced an empty nest atsome point, with their children growing up and leaving home.Among these empty nesters, 42% had experienced the return ofa child.   The researchers found that mothers who weren't crazy aboutthe maternal role back in 1956, when their children were veryyoung, were less likely to have had children return home asof 1986. Their children probably sensed mom's feelings on thesubject and didn't find their parents' home a particularlywelcoming environment. Conversely, mothers who were morecontent with their role were more likely to have returnees.Oddly, women who said family was important to happiness wereno more likely than other mothers to have children returninghome.   Mothers who had gone back to school or who had workedintermittently during the 30-year period were most likely tohave returnees. These women may be more flexible in allrealms of life, including the comings and goings of children.Children were also more likely to return to parents withhigher incomes.                                                                                                          Religion Isn't a Factor   In Some Jews' Identities                                                                                                          FOR JEWS in America, self-identity isn't just a matter ofreligion.   A national survey representing all religious groups in theU.S. was conducted by sociologists Sidney Goldstein of BrownUniversity and Barry Kosmin of the City University of NewYork. The survey found 3,665 households that identifiedthemselves as Jewish in four different ways.   A majority of those households, 59%, said that they wereJewish because of their religion. Another 27% of households,which didn't list their religion as Jewish, said one or moremembers considered themselves Jewish; this is considered anethnic self-identification. About 11% said at least onemember of the household had a Jewish parent. And 4% claimedto have one or more members who were raised Jewish.   People who are Jewish by religion were found to be moreconcentrated in big cities and to have higher-than-averageeducational and income levels. Those who claimed Jewishethnicity were more geographically dispersed. There were fewdifferences between the two groups in marital or employmentstatus.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          MEN SPEND significantly less time with daughters than withsons -- less time playing, eating, talking and on outings,according to Diane N. Lye of the University of Washington.The only thing fathers don't spend less time on is reading todaughters and helping with homework. Daughters don't get moreof their mothers' time than sons to make up for the deficit,Ms. Lye found. . . . Women who moonlight are not only busierthan average with work. They also have more children thanother women. A study by Sandra L. Boyd-Davis of theUniversity of Southern California found that 42% of marriedwomen who have a wage or salary job and who also work on theside have two or more children, compared with 37% ofself-employed women, 32% of women who work a wage or salaryjob only and 35% of those who don't work.</TEXT></DOC>
