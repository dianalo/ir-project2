The criminal investigation at the sprawling New York tradingpits at the World Trade Center reportedly focuses on a firm whosepresident was cited for regulatory violations in 1985.   About 16 agents from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and theCommodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday subpoenaed theCommodity Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the NewYork Cotton Exchange; and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Noarrests were made or arrest warrants issued.   The CFTC, a federal regulatory agency, is seeking informationabout trading practices by firms and individuals in a civilinvestigation, the exchanges said in statements.   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office is leading another criminalprobe that involved seizing documents from two offices of a singlefirm, which sources identified as MBF Clearing Corp.   The firm is run by Mark Bradley Fisher, a Comex member who paid$60,000 to settle trading practice violations with the CFTC in 1985.   U.S. Postal Service inspector Jack Ellis said document searchesauthorized in two warrants were conducted ``at two differentoffices of the same individual'' _ rooms 992 and 9926 at 4 WorldTrade Center.   The National Futures Association in Chicago lists the address ofMBF Clearing as room 992 of 4 World Trade Center. A buildingdirectory also lists the firms MBF Trading and Dollar IndexServices as operating from the office.   Traders said at least three silver futures traders from onecompany were called off the the floor of the Commodity Exchange,while an independent trader was called from the New York MercantileExchange.   All the subpoenaed exchanges said they would cooperate with theCFTC, which can bring civil charges. The New York Futures Exchangewas not a target of the probe, officials said.   Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary T. McFadden said the CFTCsubpoenaed the exchange for information from the last two years on20 present or former Nymex members.   ``We do not know what the scope of their investigation is at thepresent time nor specifically what they are targeting in on,''McFadden said.   The Commodity Exchange said it was ordered to produce documentson about 27 past and present exchange members by May 17, while sixindividual traders were subpoenaed directly. The Coffee, Sugar andCocoa Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange said they weresubpoenaed about an unspecified number of members.   The exchanges trade commodities from oil to frozen orange juice.   The commodities are bought and sold on a sprawling floor bytraders shouting orders in chaotic pits, which are monitored byofficials from the CFTC and the individual exchanges.   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., saidCFTC and exchange officials will testify before the committee onMay 17 at a hearing on floor trading practices at the nation'sexchanges. The agriculture committee oversees the CFTC, which is upfor congressional reauthorization this year.   Leahy said the committee has been reviewing trading practices atthe New York and Chicago exchanges since mid-January and the NewYork investigation would be addressed at the hearing.   Chicago U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas refused to comment on theNew York probe, but a source in his office who spoke on conditionof anonymity said it was unrelated to the Justice Departmentinvestigations at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago MercantileExchange.   No indictments have been announced, but as many as 200 subpoenasreportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the Chicagoexchanges.   The New York Times today quoted unnamed government officials assaying the New York probe focused on a number of issues, includingso-called tax trades. In such deals, which can be illegal,pre-arranged trades are executed to include false losses and deferincome.</TEXT></DOC>
