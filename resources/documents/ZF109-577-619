 Not that I wasn't glad to get the update--almost anything wouldcome as a welcome replacement for version 1.0.andP;  As it turns out, version 1.1is a significant, if not stunning, improvement over version 1.0.andP;  No majornew features have been added, but the performance has been improved, somerestrictions have been lifted, a lot of the bugs are gone, and I'm rarelyvisited by the dreaded &quot;Insufficient memory&quot; errors that plagued my earlierdevelopment efforts with dBASE IV.andM;The release of dBASE IV I'm currently working with is dated 07/17/90.andP;  Imention this because Ashton-Tate has pledged that they will provide regularmaintenance releases to fixed bugs, so you may not receive the same releasecovered here.andP;  You can either check your dBASE directory for the date onDBASE.EXE or use the VERSION() function to get the &quot;true&quot; version number (&quot;?andO;VERSION(1)&quot; returns &quot;dBASE IV 1.1xx500 (07/17/90)&quot; on my disks).andM;Faster installationandM;The installation program for dBASE IV has been streamlined in version 1.1.andO;While most users rarely run the install program more than once or twice, theinstallation program is sufficiently simple that corporate support personnelmight be able to let non-technical users perform the update themselves.andM;A few bugs in the install program have been fixed.andP;  For example, you can nowrun the install program even with SHARE installed in memory.andP;  However, if youplan on using dBASE IV's SQL mode and install dBASE IV in a drive ordirectory other than the suggested default of C:\DBASE, be prepared to editthe SQLHOME path in the CONFIG.DB file produced by the standard installation.andO;Unless you manually reset the SQLHOME path in CONFIG.DB to the correctdirectory for the SQL system catalogs, you'll be unable to switch to SQLmode.andP;  Even then, you'll have problems accessing the SAMPLE database sinceits location is also set to C:\DBASE in the database catalog table,SYSDBS.DBF.andM;Fewer disks but moreandM;space neededandM;Version 1.1 of dBASE IV is distributed on fewer disks than version 1.0--only14 360K disks compared to 20 for the Developer Edition of each version.andP;  Thisreduction in distribution disks has been achieved by compressing the files onmost of the disks into a single self-extracting EXE file using shareware filecompression utilities from PKWARE.andP;  The disk files are automaticallyuncompressed as they're copied by the install program.andP;  This file compressionis needed in one case because the main overlay for dBASE IV (which replacessix files totaling 1.5M) is over 1.8M in size.andM;The documentation states that the minimum disk space for a dBASE IVinstallation is now 4M.andP;  This is somewhat overstated--I was able get theinstalled size down to about 2.5M by deleting unessential files.andP;  Completeinstallation of the Developer's Edition requires an incredible 8.2M(surprisingly, there wasn't an upgrade offer from a hard disk manufacturerstuck in the Developer's Edition box--someone's missing a market here).andM;Revised documentationandM;Although there have been substantial internal changes in dBASE IV, much ofthe user interface is similar or identical to version 1.0.andP;  Because of this,most of the documentation (at least in the version that I received) has notbeen fully updated.andP;  Documentation that has been updated includes:andM;* The Getting Started with dBASE IV booklet has a new change summary withchanges specific to version 1.1,andM;* The Language Reference has been updated with new commands and functions,andM;* The dBASE IV for Developers book has been combined with the TemplateLanguage book and updated,andM;* The Using the Menu System book has been updated with improvements to thedBASE IV user menus.andM;A README.DOC file offers notes on changes not included in the revisedportions of the documentation or in the Getting Started change summary.andP;  Besure to read the issue of TechNotes/dBASE IV you get in the package--itcontains lots of vital information left out of the documentation andREADME.DOC file.andM;Lower memory requirementsandM;According to the documentation, memory requirements for dBASE IV have beenreduced from 516K to 450K.andP;  While I couldn't verify this as an absolute limit(and achieving adequate performance requires as much free memory as you canprovide), some of my application code that often failed (depending on machineconfiguration and RAM usage) due to lack of memory under version 1.0 seems tofunction just fine under version 1.1.andP;  On one machine the MEMORY() functionreported 100K free under version 1.0 and 106K under version 1.1.andP;  However,when I checked free memory using RUN CHKDSK, version 1.0 showed only 133Kfree while version 1.1 showed 230K free.andP;  This reduction in memory usage willbe particularly important if you've been trying to use dBASE IV on a network(especially on Banyan and 3Com networks).andM;Improved performanceandM;Version 1.1 includes a disk caching program, DBCACHE, that improves dBASEIV's performance by using either extended or expanded memory to cacherecently accessed data and code overlays.andP;  The type of memory used by thecaching program is determined when you install dBASE IV but can be changedlater using a batch file.andP;  DBCACHE is only active while dBASE IV isloaded--it's loaded into memory by the dBASE start-up program and is removedfrom memory when you exit dBASE IV.andP;  Although files on network drives can'tbe cached, performance can still be improved by using caching for the dBASEIV program and overlay files--provided they're copied to a local hard disk.andM;The dBASE IV disk caching program appears to be reliable and unobtrusive,although I did find a few conflicts with other software.andP;  For example,DBCACHE detected another caching program that I normally use (a version ofMultisoft's PC-Kwik that comes bundled with Bernoulli Box drives from Iomega)and refused to load.andP;  Without DBCACHE, dBASE IV still loaded and executednormally although somewhat slower.andP;  This doesn't seem to be a problem withall other disk caching software, since DBCACHE ran with Microsoft'sSMARTDRV.SYS disk caching program without any apparent conflicts.andP;  Thedocumentation strongly suggests that DBCACHE be disabled when running underWindows 3.0, when using the Microsoft HIMEM.SYS XMS driver, or when anothercache program is installed.andM;In some cases it may be necessary to load a special device driver(DBCINIT.EXE) in CONFIG.SYS if you're using TSRs such as SideKick.andP;  DBCINITreserves certain interrupt vectors required by DBCACHE (although you probablywon't need to know anything about this).andM;dBASE IV now uses two DOS environment variables, DBTMP and TMP, to determinewhere to put its temporary files.andP;  If a path is specified in DBTMP, it'll beused for temporary files.andP;  If not, dBASE checks for the TMP variable and usesits contents as the temporary file path if it's defined.andP;  Being able tocontrol placement of these files can help improve performance in some cases.andO;On workstations with sufficient RAM (after assigning memory for caching andother uses) a RAM disk could be set up and used to hold the temporary files.andO;The dBASE IV README.DOC file says that dBASE IV must be able to open a 300Ktemporarily file on this temporary drive when it starts up.andM;You also have better control over memory usage with version 1.1 A DOSenvironment variable, DBHEAP, is provided to set the percentage of memoryused for data and code overlays.andP;  I would have preferred setting this throughthe CONFIG.DB file (actually, I would prefer that the software figure out howto best use available memory so I don't have to worry about memory usage atall) rather than a DOS variable that must somehow be set up (in a batch fileor manually) before dBASE is loaded.andM;Support for PostScript printersandM;Version 1.1 includes support for any PostScript printer that's 100-percentcompatible with the Apple LaserWriter.andP;  PostScript support is useful(particularly in situations where the shared network laser printer is aPostScript printer) but there are some limitations.andP;  For example, a typicalPostScript printer has dozens of resident fonts, but dBASE IV directlysupports only five fonts (by default only the first three are used by thePostScript driver and are assigned to Courier, Helvetica, and Times-Roman).andO;Also, reports produced by dBASE IV assume that a monospaced ornon-proportional font is being used--if a proportional font is used, thecolumns in the report may not be correctly aligned.andM;You can, of course, send PostScript commands directly to the printer usingdBASE's ??? command.andP;  This bypasses the printer driver.andP;  For example, ???&quot;FF&quot;is used to eject a page since EJECT won't work with PostScript printers.andO;Also, complete programs written in PostScript (which is, in fact, aprogramming language) can be downloaded to the printer.andP;  However, writing anddebugging (be sure to pick up a few extra cases of paper before you try this)PostScript programs might not be a very productive use of your time, anddBASE IV should provide better support.andM;What's newandM;for developers?andM;New commands and functionsandM;Version 1.1 provides several new commands and functions, although the changesand additions are relatively minor.andP;  These language changes include:andM;* BLANK option for ON SELECTION POPUP--Causes the pop-up menu to disapperfrom the screen after a selection is madeandM;* CERROR()--A new function thatandM;* CERRORO--A new function that reports the number of the last compile-timeerrorandM;* Conditional indexes--A logical expression can now be used to restrict theset of records included in the index (INDEX ON...FOR).andP;  This feature isuseful when selecting a subset of records (like SET FILTER) but is much moreefficient if the data must be passed over more than once during processing.andO;Unfortunately, conditional indexing can only be used with MDX type index tagsrather than NDX type index filesandM;* KEYBOARD--A new command to stuff characters into the keyboard buffer (likethe identical command in FoxPro, FoxBase+, and Clipper)andM;* LKSYS()--Now takes additional parameters to return the time, date, and username for the last lock (rather than just the current lock) placed on a recordandM;* RELEASE SCREENS--A new option for the RELEASE command that allows screenssaved with SAVE SCREEN to be released.andP;  This command was present butundocumented in version 1.0.andP;  Unlike FoxPro or Clipper, dBASE IV doesn'ttreat saved screens like memory variables, and the standard RELEASE commanddoesn't release them from memoryandM;* REPLACE FROM ARRAY--A new command that updates one or more records with thecontents of a memory array (just like COPY TO ARRAY creates an array from oneor more records)andM;* REQUIRED clause on @...GET--An additional clause, REQUIRED, can bespecified after VALID and RANGE conditions on a GET to force validation ofdata even if the contents of the GET aren't editedandM;* RUN()--A new function that executes a DOS program (like the RUN or !andO;commands) and returns a numeric result (apparently always 0)andM;* SAVE SCREEN and RESTORE SCREEN--New commands that save and restore thecurrent screen image.andP;  Like RELEASE SCREEN, these commands were present butundocumented in version 1.0andM;* SET()--Now works with additional values, such as COLOR, DEFAULT, DIRECTORY,FILTER, PATH, PROCEDURE, and VIEW)andM;* SET CURSOR OFF/ON--A new command that hides or displays the cursorandM;* SET DBTRAP--A new command that controls the degree of protection againstprogram errors during execution of UDF or &quot;ON&quot; commands (see below for moredetail)andM;* SET DIRECTORY--A new command used to specify the default operating systemdrive and directoryandM;* SET MESSAGE...AT--Now allows the row and column for message displays (from@...GET...MESSAGE, MENUs, and POPUs) to be specifiedandM;* WINDOW()--A new function that returns the name of the currently activewindowandM;User-defined help can now be made available within a screen form by creatinga specially formatted and named data file.andP;  The help file must contain arecord for each field for which you want to provide help.andM;Fewer restrictions on UDFsandM;Some of the restrictions on UDF usage have been relaxed in version 1.1.andP;  Anew command, SET DBTRAP ON/OFF, provides some control over theserestrictions.andP;  In the default setting of DBTRAP ON, the current work area andactive window are saved before the UDF or ON command is activated andrestored after the UDF is done.andP;  The following restrictions apply:andM;* The currently active database can't be closed or altered.andM;* The current window can't be cleared, altered, or released.andM;* Recursive calls to the BROWSE, EDIT, CHANGE, INSERT, or APPEND commandsaren't allowed.andM;* The LIST and DISPLAY COMMANDS can't be called recursively.andM;* UDFs can't be used in index expressions.andM;If DBTRAP is set OFF, some of these restrictions on UDF usage are lifted, butthe programmer must then ensure that the UDF doesn't inadvertently alter thesystem state.andM;Changes to RunTimeandM;The Developer's Edition comes with RunTime, a special version of the programthat enables you to distribute applications without requiring that the userpurchase a copy of dBASE IV.andM;Like dBASE IV version 1.1, RunTime uses disk caching to improve performance.andO;A non-cached version of RunTime can also be created to circumvent conflictsbetween the caching software and other system software.andM;With version 1.1 of RunTime, fewer files need to be distributed (three orfour vs.andP;  seven or eight in version 1.0).andP;  However, disk space requirementshave increased from 967K in version 1.0 to roughly 1.5M in version 1.1.andO;Also, like the main dBASE IV programs, RunTime uses a single, very largeoverlay file (1.3M) that won't fit on a high density disk.andP;  This largeoverlay is actually constructed out of several smaller overlay files duringthe installation process (by the supplied installation batch file).andP;  Thisincrease in disk space requirements shouldn't be a major problem, since theruntime files on the Ashton-Tate distribution disks are already compressed(in self-extracting files).andM;What's not fixedandM;Fewer restrictions on SQLandM;Many of the restrictions placed on using dBASE commands while in SQL mode (orwithin a PRS SQL command file) have been lifted in version 1.1.andP;  In additionto being able to use dBASE data manipulation commands (such as USE, BROWSE,APPEND, etc.) in SQL mode, many of the Control Center options, includingqueries, labels, and reports, are now accessible in SQL mode.andP;  UDFs can alsobe used for SQL mode although they still can't be used within a SQLstatement.andM;Last minute patchesandM;Some of the changes in version 1.1 seem to be last minute patches.andP;  Forexample, you can get a special pop-up menu in your label files if you set aDOS environmental variable (SET DTL_LBLOPT=ON) prior to starting dBASE IV.andO;You only have to do this when creating or modifying the label form.andP;  This isdocumented in the copy of the TechNotes/dBASEIV newsletter included withdBASE IV (and mentioned briefly in the README.DOC file).andP;  This feature shouldhave been directly accessible from the label design tool rather thanrequiring setting a DOS variable.andM;&quot;Missing&quot; commandsandM;Many commands or language concepts still seem only partially implemented indBASE IV.andP;  For example, the function WINDOW() was added to return the name ofthe currently active window.andP;  This function is equivalent to the WONTOP()function in FoxPro and was sorely needed; but additional functions todetermine how windows are defined or which ones are visible, and their size(for example, foxPro's WEXIST(), WVISIBLE(), WCOLS(), and WROWS() aren'tprovided.andM;In this age of windowing and graphical user interfaces dBASE IV still doesn'tsupport a mouse.andP;  Curiously, an advertising insert for a software product, dBMouse Patch, that adds mouse support to dBASE IV is included in the dBASE IVpackage.andM;Describing a list of language features still missing from dBASE IV would be apretty pointless exercise.andP;  I'm sure you'd have a different list than I wouldand in any case Ashton-Tate has been a little too busy hemorrhaging red inkto worry much about language enhancements for the time being.andM;Should you update fromandM;version 1.0?andM;Yes, if you're using version 1.0 of dBASE IV you should definitely get andinstall an update (it's free!).andP;  Version 1.1 is a marked improvement in termsof reliability and memory requirements over version 1.0.andP;  In some cases,performance may also be improved by version 1.1's disk caching although theimpovement may not be as significant in multi-user installations.andM;Converting from 1.0andM;If you're replacing an existing copy of dBASE IV version 1.0 with version1.1, there are a few things you should be aware of:andM;* Programs must be recompiled: version 1.1 apparently uses a different formatfor DBO (compiled source code) files; it requires that program source code(PRG) files compiled under version 1.0 be recompiled before execution.andP;  dBASEIV will automatically detect that recompilation is needed and, provided thesource code files are available in the same directory that contains the DBOfile, the files will be recompiled automatically.andM;* DEFINE PAD no longer adds a space to each side of the PROMPT text.andP;  Thedocumentation recommends that applications produced using the dBASE IVApplications Generator be regenerated to correct a possible doubling of thefirst character of the pad text.andP;  This shouldn't be a problem with manuallyproduced menus although you might want to edit the menu definitions to addthe spaces to the pad text.andM;Should you buy it?andM;If you're currently using dBASE III PLUS, I heartily recommend that you getan update to some other product.andP;  However, even with its substantialimprovements over version 1.0, dBASE IV is still missing features availablein other dBASE-compatible products.andM;If you're currently using some other dBASE-compatible product, such asClipper, Quicksilver, of FoxPro, I recomment that you stick with what youhave.andP;  Converting existing source code that uses product-specific extensionsto dBASE IV can be a significant undertaking.andP;  Ashton-Tate does publish autility called Step IVWard, which provides some help in converting programswritten in other xBASE dialects to dBASE IV, but lots of work must still bedone manually and the results are usually less than spectacular.andM;I suspect the release of version 1.1 will boost both Ashton-Tate's sales andthe sales of compatible product publishers such as Fox Software andNantucket.andP;  Users and companies that have been long-time users of Ashton-Tateproducts should find version 1.1 of dBASE IV a substantial improvement.andO;Users and developers who have moed on to different xBASE products (or outsidethe xBASE market) are likely to continue on their chosen path, since thisrelease of dBASE IV doesn't seem to provide any compelling reason to comeback.andM;Rather than being a significant update in terms of added functionality,version 1.1 of dBASe IV is what version 1.0 should have been when it wasfirst released.andM;James Buzzard owns a database and application design consulting firm,Hammerhead Systems.andP;  His industry experience includes four years as V.P.andP;  ofEngineering at SBT Corp. and a background in finance and accounting.andP;  You cancontact him via MCI mail (JBUZZ).andM;Users Speak Out onandM;dBASE IVandM;My feeling on version 1.1 is that it's back in the driver's seat forAshton-Tate.andP;  dBASE IV will be the benchmark for many years to come.andM;James Williams, Sr.andP;  Systems Analyst Bendix Corp. Columbia, MarylandandM;dBASE IV 1.1 works better than version 1.0, mainly in memory.andP;  We took someof our applications and ran them under version 1.1, and we were ecstatic withit, believe me!andM;Patricia Tao, Staff Engineer Hughes Aircraft Company Fullerton, Calif.andM;Our worst problems with the old release came in memory.andP;  We run it on anetwork and we had a very hard time with large database files when our userstried to access the data, especially through the Control Center in version1.0.andP;  Many of our memory problems were solved with 1.1.andP;  We had some problemswith the report generator and Query By Example (QBE) not being able to updatecertain kinds of data.andP;  Our users are very advanced, so we had to do lots ofproblem solving.andP;  With version 1.1, the problems aren't hitting us like theywere.andM;Karen Morton Aluminum Co. of America Alcoa, TennesseeandM;dBASE IV 1.1 looks good, especially the UDFs.andP;  I come from a Clipperbackground, so UDFs are second nature.andP;  With many of the limitations lifted,I can program better.andM;Ray Lew, PC Specialist Energy Services Nevada Power Co. Las Vegas, NevadaandM;Probably the biggest difference I notice between dBASE IV 1.0 and 1.1 isn'tthe bug fixes or the additional commands.andP;  It's that you can do just aboutanything with UDFs.andP;  I was a little disappointed in the way they handledexpanded and extended memory as cache.andP;  It seems like a cop-out.andP;  It's justnot a part of dBASE.andP;  They say dBASE uses it, but I disagree.andP;  dBASE doesn'tuse it.andP;  What they have is dBASE with some caching that just comes with it.andM;Paul D.
