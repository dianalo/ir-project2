Did he like what hefound, I asked as we were waiting to board the plane home.&quot;Yes, {President Carlos} Salinas is certainly on the righttrack,&quot; he answered. &quot;He's opened the country up and pushedthrough the privatization of the banks faster than anyonedreamed possible.&quot; But, warned the banker, who claimed tohave lost an earlier investment during the 1982 devaluationsand nationalizations, &quot;they still haven't repudiated theoriginal nationalization of the banks. Who's to say theywon't change back again?&quot;   As Mr. Salinas visits the U.S. this week to meet withinvestors and legislators, the question is not whether he isdoing the right things, but whether the changes will last.The revolutionary, market-oriented changes being whiskedthrough Congress are overwhelmingly popular, both here andabroad. Even leftist Mexican Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo hasrecently endorsed, in principle, the most politically thornyof the open-market policies: a free-trade agreement with theU.S. and Canada.</LP><TEXT>   But the same swiftness and firmness with which Mr. Salinashas turned around years of protectionist, state planning hashighlighted a weakness in Mexico's political structure thateventually could derail the economic progress: As Mr. Salinasand his policies gain in popularity, the political systemthat grants him power to make such dramatic changes is lesspopular than ever. And that doesn't do much to assure waryinvestors that &quot;guarantees&quot; made today will not be rescindedtomorrow.   In private, leaders of the ruling InstitutionalRevolutionary Party (PRI) say a complete renunciation of thepast is impossible. As explanation, one is reminded that 35of the Mexican congressmen who have approved Mr. Salinas'splans to privatize the banks had, just eight years earlier,heartily endorsed then-President Jose Lopez Portillo'snationalization. It is exactly this type of blind allegianceto the executive that worries investors.   Guillermo Ortiz, deputy secretary of the Finance Ministryin charge of the bank privatization, insists that repudiationof past mistakes is not necessary to draw investors toMexico. &quot;The bank privatization is not an isolated move; it'spart of a whole change of policy,&quot; he says. Mr. Ortizemphasizes that, &quot;the actual privatization is probably goingto be less significant than the process of deregulation ofthe banks that started two years ago.&quot;   Indeed, perceived political weaknesses should in no waydiminish Mexico's recent economic successes and its evengreater growth potential. One of the more optimisticprojections is found in a report to be issued July 2 byPolyconomics, a New Jersey consulting firm with an office inMexico: &quot;In terms of size, population, resources, and overalleconomic scope, Mexico should be much more than the nextSouth Korea: by the year 2000, it should be one of theworld's economic powers.&quot;   Among the report's many recommendations for continuedgrowth and development are a further lowering andsimplification of tax rates, a complete overhaul of thedisasterously inefficient state-controlled farming structureand a further deregulation of Mexico's emerging equity market(estimated at about 10% of gross national product).   On this latter point, Mr. Ortiz says his office has takenthe first steps toward opening an over-the-counter market forcompanies currently not big enough to qualify for capital inthe equity market. &quot;As the public gains an ever greateraccess to information {about companies} in Mexico, we will beable to cut back on the regulations designed to protect thepublic,&quot; Mr. Ortiz says. &quot;We even have private rating firmsnow. So, eventually you won't have to have a bank guarantee anew issue.&quot;   However fast capital market deregulation is introduced, itwould be hard to match the runaway success of Mexico'ssupply-side tax cuts. Even so, the government seemsunnecessarily wary of pushing rate reductions much further.&quot;Yes, we have collected more revenue from lower rates,&quot; saysFrancisco Gil Diaz, deputy minister of finance for taxation,&quot;but I think it's too early to call it a supply-sidephenomenon.&quot;   Tax revenues, as a percentage of GNP, increased to 10.5%last year from 9.7% in 1988, according to Bank of Mexicofigures. One of the biggest jumps came in the revenue fromincome tax -- this during a period when the top personal ratefell to 35% from 40% and the corporate rate fell to 35% from42%. Revenue from import taxes also grew significantly, againbecause of dramatic cuts in import taxes and the resultingrush of imports.   Still, current tax laws remain complex and arbitrarilyenforced. One financial writer tells of painstakingly fillingout myriad tax forms only to be told his accounting wasincorrect when he presented it to the tax authorities at oneof the two banks that accept tax receipts. He rechecked hisfigures and resubmitted his form to the other bank. There,his tax forms and payment were accepted.   Complicated inflation-accounting procedures for taxcomputation are beyond the capacities of many of the smallbusinesses the government hopes to lure back into the formaleconomy with reduced rates and better enforcement. A recentarticle in El Financiero, a financial daily, told of alottery-ticket saleswoman who broke into tears at a bankbecause she was unable to fill out a tax form. Mr. Gil Diazis unmoved. &quot;Tax laws in Mexico are not too complicated,&quot; hecontends. &quot;We hope to do away with inflation accounting byeliminating inflation.&quot;   Although slow to embrace the success of its tax-ratereductions, at least the government has rejected therecessionary &quot;shock&quot; formula urged on it by several of themultilateral lending institutions that recommend higher taxesand severe currency devaluations. Renewed confidence in thecurrency is paramount in a country where purchasing power hasbeen eroded by close to 50% since 1983, and as Mexicans gainaccess to markets and goods formerly restricted to them. Thegovernment announced two weeks ago that it would slow downthe rate of currency devaluation by 20% (from one peso a dayto 80 centavos). This reduces the annual rate of devaluationto 10.5% from 14%.   Not only is Mr. Salinas confident of increased investmentto support the value of the peso, but he is convinced thatMexico will grow its way out of inflation through tax,deregulation and investment incentives. So far, he seems tobe right. Inflation came down to 20% last year from a high of200% in 1987, and GNP increased 2.9% in 1989 and 1.1% in1988. For next year, government officials privately forecasta 7% growth rate with 5% inflation.   All these changes have left the government's politicalopponents in disarray. The primary problem for the NationalAction Party (PAN) is that the government is doing exactlywhat the PAN has been recommending for decades. Thus, the PANis losing an important distinction between itself and theruling party. Jose Angel Conchello, a PAN member of Congress,says his party missed an opportunity with the announcement ofthe bank privatization: &quot;We knew for some time that Salinaswas planning to privatize the banks. We should have demandedthat the president immediately begin privatizing the banksand then claimed victory after he did so. We should now bedemanding an immediate change in agricultural policy.&quot;   The left of the political spectrum suffers from theproblem confronting socialist parties world-wide: defense ofan ideology that has been thoroughly discredited. Accordingto political analyst Lorenzo Meyer, &quot;The Mexican left hasbeen unable to move from an enthusiastic social movement to acoherent political party. They may now be trying to redefinethemselves in the image of, say, a Felipe Gonzalez-type ofsocialist-against corporate elitism, but in favor of openmarkets.&quot; Here again, however, Mr. Salinas is one step aheadof the competition; by subjecting Mexico's business elites toforeign competition he has cut into any monopolisticinterests the business community had.   Although Mr. Salinas may not have an opposition party toworry about, his own party is no longer the leviathan it oncewas. The union movement with which the PRI had a 40-yearalliance has lost much of its power due to the emergence ofindependent unions and the growth of non-unionized labor.Charges of electoral fraud continue to haunt the party --most recently in a local election in the state of Michoacantwo weeks ago. And as practically all restrictions have beenlifted from the Mexican press, detailed reports of corruptionamong local PRI administrations have lowered the PRI'salready dismal reputation. Says Mr. Meyer: &quot;The PRI hasbecome as irrelevent to what is happening in the president'soffice as is the left and right. And how long can a popularpresident survive as top representative of anunrepresentative political party?&quot;   In the long run, the lack of credible political parties isgoing to cause some problems for the economic policies beingforged now, no matter how successful or popular they may be.In September the PRI will hold an important party conference.There are reports that Mr. Salinas may announce the formationof a new party to replace the PRI. Any steps he takes tostrengthen the party process in Mexico, at a moment when hehas the political strength to do so, will be vital. Thatcould be the signal to investors -- both foreign and Mexican-- that the wise reforms being made today will not be quicklyor easily reversed.   ---   Mr. Asman edits the Journal's Americas column.   ---                    Mexico's Tax Revenue                                                                                                          As a percentage of GNP                                                                                                                                             1988            1989                                                                                                        TOTAL                                9.7%            10.5%                                                                                                        Income tax (Corporate andamp; personal)    5.1              5.5                                                                                                        Value-added tax                      2.9              3.0                                                                                                        Oil tax                              1.0              0.9                                                                                                        Import tax                           0.4              0.8                                                                                                        Other                                0.3              0.3                                                                                                        Source: Bank of Mexico</TEXT></DOC>
