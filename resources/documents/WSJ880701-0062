Christian Hill (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BCY </IN><TEXT>   A California state jury awarded investors in Technical Equities Corp., a San Jose, Calif., investment-advisory firm in bankruptcy-law proceedings, $147 million in punitive damages. But the plaintiffs will have a tough time collecting much of it.    Technical Equities sought creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in 1986, amid charges by shareholders and investors in state court that its chairman, Harry Stern, and other officers misappropriated funds and misrepresented investments. About 1,200 mostly wealthy shareholders and limited partners, including famous sports figures, had losses of an estimated $150 million.    As previously reported, a group of institutional defendants, including Technical Equities' lender, Security Pacific Corp.; its auditor, KMG Main Hurdman; and its broker, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., have agreed to pay $60 million to settle claims against them.    Last week, a jury in Santa Clara County awarded the investors more than $6 million in compensatory damages in their litigation against the remaining defendants -- Mr. Stern, former chief financial officer Herbert Barovsky, a Stern-Barovsky partnership and four other former officers. Late Wednesday, the jury awarded the $147 million in punitive damages, but only against Messrs. Stern and Barovsky, and their partnership.    The award is believed to be the largest punitive-damage assessment ever in California, and one of the biggest nationally involving an investor-fraud case. But attorneys for both the plaintiffs and Technical Equities have no idea whether any assets remain in the possession of the defendants, or whether they lost most of them by making poor investments.    &quot;I think there is some money there, but how much I don't know,&quot;said Allan Steyer, a plaintiffs' attorney. Mr. Stern is charged in the litigation with diverting millions of dollars to his own accounts, but Michael Eagan, an attorney representing a committee of Technical Equities' creditors, said that a search of Mr. Stern's bank accounts has turned up nothing.    Messrs. Stern and Barovsky have pleaded the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, in response to the litigation.&quot; The two defendants are also under criminal investigation for fraud. Yesterday, Mr. Stern's attorney wasn't available for comment. Mr. Barovsky's lawyer, John Kaman, said his client would appeal the judgments against him. Mr. Kaman added that the punitive-damage award &quot;was excessive to say the least. My client doesn't have a penny. Punitive damages are supposed to bear some reasonable relationship to net worth, and these don't.&quot;    All or part of the more than $6 million in compensatory damages may be covered by National Union Fire Insurance Co., a unit of American International Group Inc., under a directors and officers liability policy. Attorneys for both the investors and for Technical Equities are seeking as much as $30 million from National Union, but the insurer has asserted that its coverage is limited to $10 million. The lawyers said they are considering seeking punitive damages from National Union for alleged bad faith, a charge the insurer denies.    In a separate federal court action, Technical Equities is suing Mr. Stern, its former directors and KMG Main Hurdman, which is now a part of Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co.    The attorneys for Messrs. Stern and Barovsky weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
