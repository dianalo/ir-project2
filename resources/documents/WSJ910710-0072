The rumors were fueled by reports that Moscow iscompleting lengthy negotiations with U.S. and European banksfor credit to buy large amounts of U.S. crops.</LP><TEXT>   The White House agreed in June to guarantee $1.5 billionof credit that the Soviet Union managed to arrange withbanks. However, Moscow's negotiations were apparently slowedby persistent doubts among potential lenders about itscreditworthiness, grain traders said yesterday.   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corncontract for July delivery rose 0.75 cent a bushel to settleat $2.245 a bushel. The soybean contract for July deliveryrose 2.25 cents a bushel to settle at $5.23 a bushel.   Few traders think yesterday's slight rally is a sign thatthe worst of the long plunge in grain prices is ending. U.S.crop prices have fallen for several weeks because nearlyideal growing conditions are increasing the chances of bumperharvests at a time when farm exports are slipping.   U.S. exports have been particularly hurt by the creditproblems of the Soviet Union, which is usually a major grainbuyer. Even with the credit guarantees granted by the WhiteHouse, however, most grain analysts expect Soviet purchasesto decline this year from 1990.   Nonetheless, the prospect that the long-awaited Sovietgrain purchases might begin in earnest is enough to send ashot of adrenaline through the depressed grain markets.   &quot;Despite the fact we have been anticipating this for sometime, it causes some knee-jerk reaction,&quot; said Steve Assimos,manager of the grain analytical group at Cargill InvestorServices Inc., Chicago.   Grain traders expect the Soviet Union to spend about $600million by late September to purchase mostly corn and soybeanmeal.   The recovery in crop prices yesterday was also fueled byforecasts for a blast of hot and dry weather over much of thenation's mid-section next week. Because of the late plantingseason, some of the corn crop next week will still be inpollination, the stage in which it is most vulnerable to hightemperatures.   Wheat prices rose amid expectations that the AgricultureDepartment will trim its forecast of the soft red winterwheat crop in a monthly crop report slated for release afterthe close of trading Thursday. Warm and moist conditions inthe spring promoted an outbreak of plant diseases and fungusin parts of the Midwest crop.   According to Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain andamp;Livestock Corp., Chicago, traders generally expect theAgriculture Department to forecast a hefty soybean harvest ofroughly two billion bushels. Most traders have been raisingtheir harvest estimates amid reports that soybean farmersplanted about 2.7 million acres more than originally forecastbased on March conditions.   Traders also expect the department to predict a cornharvest of roughly 8.150 billion bushels compared to itsoriginal estimate of 8.275 billion bushels. Although cornyields are expected to be healthy, farmers planted about200,000 fewer acres than originally expected.   The corn and soybean harvest estimates are little morethan educated guesses. The government won't have a clear ideaof potential crop yields until it begins surveying fieldconditions in August.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum product prices advancedslightly in featureless trading. Many market players werewaiting for release of the weekly inventory statistics, whichthey expected to be slightly bullish. The results proved themcorrect. After trading finished on the New York MercantileExchange, the American Petroleum Institute said that gasolinestocks decreased by about three million barrels to 216.2million in the week ended July 5. While many traders wereexpecting a decline because of the increased demand thatnormally occurs around the July 4 holiday weekend, thedrawdown was larger than expected. At the same time, the APIsaid that refineries were operating at 88.4% of capacity,down from 89.6% the prior week, another bullish sign. Crudeoil inventories increased 1.1 million barrels to 350.2million, a small increase. In trading yesterday on the NewYork Merc, crude for August delivery settled at $21.29 abarrel, up five cents. August gasoline ended at 63.44 cents agallon, up 0.43 cents. Meanwhile, the American AutomobileAssociation said that gasoline pump prices actually fell onecent a gallon to an average of $1.14 cents for regularunleaded in the week ended yesterday, a sign demand may nothave been so strong over the holiday weekend. The averageretail price of gasoline has fallen 3.7 cents since June 4,largely because the recession has eaten away at demand.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell. Gold for Augustdelivery ended $1.50 an ounce lower at $370.60. Septembersilver fell 3.7 cents an ounce to $4.473. Although it wasn'treflected in trading yesterday, there has been somespeculation about possible gold sales by Abu Dhabi to coverthe commitments of Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International,said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at MerrillLynch. BCCI, which was closed by regulators around the worldon Friday, is 77%-owned by the ruler and government of AbuDhabi. Mr. O'Neill dismisses the speculation as just markettalk, which arises any time a major event occurs in theMiddle East. Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst atPaineWebber, agreed that BCCI itself isn't a factor in thegold market, but added that the bank's closure might causeliquidity problems for BCCI depositors, who may have to sellgold to raise cash.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices fell. Cotton for October deliveryfell 2 cents a pound to finish at 70.53 cents, while Decembercotton lost 1.59 cents to end at 68.89 cents. &quot;We keeplooking over the edge to see where the bottom is and it'sjust not there,&quot; said Sharon Johnson, cotton specialist atCargill Investor Services. The large stock of cottoncertified for delivery against futures contracts is leadingpeople to suspect supplies aren't as tight or demand isn't asgreat for the old crop as previously thought, she said. Alsocontributing to the decline were expectations that theAgriculture Department will raise its crop estimate in itsproduction report tomorrow from 16 million bales. Cropestimates by traders and industry members are running as highas 16.7 million bales, she said. Prices probably will declineagain today and over the next few sessions could fall to 67.5cents, she predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
