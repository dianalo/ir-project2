<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-1000 </DOCNO><TEXT>We retrospectively reviewed the records of 41 patients with an isolatedanterior mediastinal mass to identify whether the traditional surgicalapproach of resection for both diagnosis and therapy is the optimal approachto these tumors. In addition to plain chest radiographs, clinical evaluationincluded computed tomography (CT) in 23 and gallium scintigraphy in 23.The initial intervention was attempted excisional therapy in 16 and mediastinoscopyfor biopsy in 25. Pathological diagnoses included lymphoma (13), thymoma(11), germ cell tumor (6), carcinoid (2), bronchogenic carcinoma (2),and other benign processes (7). Based on histological findings, nonoperativetherapy was the most appropriate treatment in 61%. The clinical selectionof the surgical approach was not aided by patient age, symptoms, or findingson CT. The gallium scan was positive in 13 of 15 patients for whom nonoperativetherapy was appropriate, and was normal in 7 of 8 for whom excision wasindicated. Mediastinoscopy is useful in the diagnosis of anterior mediastinalmasses, and may eliminate unnecessary thoracotomy, especially when agallium scan is positive.</TEXT></DOC>
