The big insurer said net rose to $273.9 million, or $1.67 a share, from $261.6 million, or $1.60 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue advanced to $3.36 billion from $2.78 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AIG's shares fell 50 cents to close at $66.125.    The latest results include a $16.9 million capital loss caused by a restructuring of the company's bond portfolio. The revamping involved a shift of the portfolio toward nontaxable bonds from taxables, a spokesman said. A year earlier, the company reported a capital gain of $29.6 million.    The company's strategy involves offering a broad range of products world-wide, using a variety of marketing vehicles, including agents, brokers and mass-marketing methods, said M.R. Greenberg, president and chief executive officer. </TEXT></DOC>
