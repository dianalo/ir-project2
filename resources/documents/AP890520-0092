The deaths increased the number of Palestinian fatalities in the17-month-old uprising to 494. Twenty-two Israelis have been killed.   Also Saturday, Israeli police said they were investigating thedeath of a 32-year-old Palestinian whose body was found at theJewish factory in the West Bank where he worked as a night watchman.   The latest deaths came a day after a gun and grenade battle inthe West Bank that claimed the lives of an Israeli soldier andthree Palestinians.   It was the first gun battle reported during the uprising betweenIsraeli soldiers and Palestinians, who generally have attackedtroops with stones and firebombs.   A leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising who arelinked to the Palestine Liberation Organization said ``the enemyshould pay an expensive price for its crimes.''   ``The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising calls on thestrike forces to kill a settler or a soldier for every martyr ofour sons,'' said the leaflet, the 40th published in the territoriessince the start of the anti-Israeli rebellion.   Uprising leaders have made repeated calls for attacks on Israelitargets, but in the past have stopped short of urging retaliatorykillings. Most attacks on Israelis during the uprising have been bystonings or firebombs, which have often not been lethal.   The underground leaflet urged Arab countries ``to work onliquidating'' Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan forelections in the occupied territories when they convene for asummit in Morocco this week.   It also supported the killing of Palestinian collaborators withIsrael.   PLO chief Yasser Arafat warned that the use of arms may increaseif Palestinian deaths continue to climb.   ``So far our people refrained from using arms in resisting theoccupation forces, but the Israelis should understand that ourpatience is limited,'' Arafat told reporters Saturday in Baghdad,Iraq.   The army maintained a curfew on most of the Gaza Strip. Most ofthe territory's 700,000 residents have been confined indoors fornearly a week.   An army spokesman said the curfew would be lifted Sunday andthat 50,000 Gazans employed in Israel would be allowed to return totheir jobs for the first time since Tuesday when they were barredfrom entering Israel.   Mazni Abu Hatla, 13, of the Gaza town of Rafah, died in ahospital Saturday, Arab reports said. He was shot in the chestFriday during a riot, according to the reports.   Ali Abdallah Mohammed Abdallah, 18, of El Khader in the WestBank, also died Saturday. He was shot in the head in a clash May10, Arab reports said.   In the West Bank on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was wounded inthe back during a clash between stone-throwing rioters and soldiersin the town of Anabta, Arab reports said.   Seven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets or beatings inthe West Bank, and eight were wounded or injured in the Gaza Strip,Arab reports said.   The army said it had no reports of casualties.   Authorities were conducting an autopsy to determine how NajiMohammed Fakih, 32, of the West Bank town of Qatana, died, Arabreports said.   Mordechai Bareket, a police spokesman, said relatives foundFakih dead on his bed Saturday when they came to visit him at hisworkplace in a factory in the Mishor Adumim settlement nearJerusalem.   Bareket, who spoke in a telephone interview, suggested it wasunclear whether Fakih was slain or died of an illness. He said anautopsy was being conducted.
