The two-year study, published yesterday in theInternational Journal of Cancer, says that apart from theamount of meat consumed or its fat content, the way it isprepared can significantly increase the rate of colon andrectal cancers in humans. Colon cancer, for one, kills about60,000 Americans each year.</LP><TEXT>   The study in the Journal, an independent publication basedin Switzerland that is published 18 times a year, indicatedthat not only consuming meat that has been browned by frying,but also meats boiled or served with meat gravy, can boostrisks of cancer.   One previous study has suggested that 90% of colon cancerin the U.S. might be prevented by changes in diet, but fewindividual factors responsible have been established. Moststudies to date have focused on how the quantity of meat orfat eaten is correlated to colon and rectal cancer; severalhave suggested low physical activity increases risk, while ahigh-fiber diet helps. But few have looked at whether the wayin which meats are cooked might be cancer-promoting in and ofthemselves.   &quot;This study shows that cooking methods are very importantin preventing cancer,&quot; says Maria Gerhardsson de Verdier, avisiting research scholar at the University of SouthernCalifornia department of preventive medicine and lead authorof the study. Generally, she said, risks are lessened byreducing cooking temperatures and avoiding heavily brownedmeats. The researcher emphasized that the study results needto be duplicated.   &quot;This really is the first study that has done acomprehensive job of looking at how people prepare meat andthe risks of colon cancer,&quot; says James S. Felton, a groupleader for molecular toxicology at the University ofCalifornia's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory andanother leading researcher in the area.   Dr. Gerhardsson de Verdier speculates that the problemwith highly browned meats is the formation of at least 10heterocyclic amines, or cancer-causing chemicals, which havebeen shown in laboratory experiments to form in meat crust athigh cooking temperatures. Generally, she says, the chemicalsform at temperatures above 212 degrees Fahrenheit, theboiling point of water at sea level. The formation of thechemicals goes up &quot;logarithmically&quot; at temperatures higherthan 300 degrees Fahrenheit, says Dr. Felton, who believestheir formation isn't associated with fat in the meat.Laboratory studies show the chemicals affect the liver mostbut have also been shown to cause tumors in several otherorgans. Recent laboratory studies show that the heterocyclicamines present at the highest levels in fried meat causemalignant tumors in the colons of male rats.   &quot;We are eating small amounts of potent carcinogens,&quot; butno one has accurately translated these laboratory findingsinto added risk to humans, Dr. Felton says. Scientists aretrying to better understand formation of the chemicals to tryto develop specific inhibitors to their formation that mightbe applied to the food processing industry and to cookingmethods at home, he adds.   Dr. Gerhardsson de Verdier's study looked at 559 patientswith colon or rectal cancer and 505 individuals who served asa control group, all living in the Stockholm area between1986 and 1988. It measured the consumption of bacon, smokedham, beef, pork, and sausage, and the use of three cookingmethods: fried, oven-roasted, or boiled. It also analyzedwhether the individuals ate their meat by browning itlightly, moderately, or heavily, and if they cooked at low orhigh temperatures.   When adjusted for age, fat intake and gender, the studyshowed that those consuming meat fried to a heavily brownedstate were associated with 3.4 times the risk of rectalcancer and two times the risk of colon cancer compared withthose preferring moderately or lightly browned meat. Thosewho ate heavily browned meat with greater frequency, that ismore than three times a week, had six times the risk ofrectal cancer and 2.8 times the risk of colon cancer. Inaddition, eating brown gravy more than once a week wasassociated with 1.9 times the risk of rectal cancer and 1.6times the risk of colon cancer relative to eating brown gravyless than once a month.   Eating boiled meat more than two to three times a weekincreased the risk of rectal cancer 2.7 times and the risk ofcolon cancer 1.7 times compared with eating it less than oncea month.   Adjustments for dietary fiber intake, body mass andphysical activity had little or no influence on the results,the study said.   Although the study didn't indicate what risk highlybrowned meats cooked at high temperatures present to theaverage American, Dr. Gerhardsson de Verdier noted that suchresults justify altered cooking methods. In addition, Dr.Felton noted that his studies have found that somecancer-causing chemicals formed in cooked meats can bereduced 20 to 30 times by microwaving meats for one minuteand removing the juices formed before cooking the meat withany other chosen method.</TEXT></DOC>
