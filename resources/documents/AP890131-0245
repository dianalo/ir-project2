The new rules, approved at a Cabinet meeting, will be put intoeffect April 1, Finance Ministry officials said.   ``Amid the ongoing internationalization and popularization ofsecurities transactions, regulations on insider trading areindispensable for a sound development of our country's securitiesmarket by increasing the sense of fairness and transparency in thestock market,'' Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a newsconference.   Murayama said that to protect investors, companies should ``makean effort to positively open up their company information, whileestablishing a moral climate to prevent insider trading.''   In Japan, large-scale insider trading is limited because of theinfrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks ofinformation about company developments to a limited number ofinvestors are believed to be frequent, along with stock manipulationby some large brokerages, financial sources say.   The Tokyo Stock Exchange has become the world's largest stockmarket, exceeding New York and London in terms of marketcapitalization. But Japanese law previously lacked a clear-cutdefinition of insider trading.   Under the newly revised Securities and Exchange Law, securitiessubject to insider trading regulations are company bonds, stocks andwarrant bonds issued by domestic and foreign companies listed on thestock exchange, the officials said.   They said the new rules restrict advance leaks of ``importantinformation'' concerning companies, including decisions made byboard meetings on such matters as mergers and aquisitions,introduction of new products, financing and cooperative agreements.   ``Any person who leaks, for example, the news of a company'smerger will face up to six months imprisonment or a fine of 500,000yen ($3,900),'' said a Finance Ministry official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The new rules say important information will be regarded aspublic 12 hours after it has been released to more than two newsorganizations. News organizations include general newspapers, newsagencies and broadcasting organizations.   Japan's recent major stock scandal involved a different type ofpractice _ offering selected key politicians and businessmen stockshares not yet listed for public trading. Once public trading didbegin in the shares of Recruit Cosmos, a real estate company, pricesrose and early buyers made large profits.   The practice was not illegal, but raised questions of ethics anddisguised bribery.</TEXT></DOC>
