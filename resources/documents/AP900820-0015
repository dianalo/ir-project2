In a continuing battle pitting free speech against thegovernment's right to protect kids, courts in New York and SanFrancisco last week temporarily stayed federal enforcement of newrules designed to make sure the $2 billion marketplace for phonesex remains an adults-only business.   Testimony in the New York court had described some of themessages as ``re-creations of masturbation, simulated rape,sadomasochism and group sex.'' Homosexual rights groups had saidsuch services were a form of safe sex in this era of the AIDSepidemic.   Kendall Morrison, the owner of Dial Information Services and oneof the plaintiffs in the New York case, told The New York Timesthat his company received 60,000 calls a day, costing the callers$1 on average.   Until the courts decide on the constitutionality of the 1989 lawthat mandated the most recent Federal Communications Commissionrules, enterprising kids still will be able to shock mom and dadwith a mysterious charge on the family phone bill.   ``Parents have our full support and our full sympathy,'' FCCDeputy General Counsel Renee Licht said in an interview last week.``We are doing everything we possibly can to protect your childrenagainst indecent messages.''   But, she added, ``There isn't very much we can do until we havea final disposition'' of the court challenges.   Parents still can ask phone companies to block access to phonesex services, where technically possible. But the New York judgewho stayed FCC enforcement of the new rules said only 4 percent ofNew York's 4.6 million households had asked the phone company forblocking.   Congress and the FCC since 1983 have been trying to erecttechnological barriers to ``indecent,'' for-pay phone material.Obscene material _ of a prurient, sexual nature and withoutredeeming value _ is banned outright on commercial phone, radio andtelevision services.   But the courts have held that adults have a right to hearindecency, which the FCC defines as ``patently offensive''depictions or descriptions of sexual material.   The courts also have said the government has a compelling publicinterest in keeping indecent material away from children. The bigproblem is how to do that without trampling on the free speechrights of phone sex providers _ and the adults who want to callthem.   In 1987, following two previous court defeats, the FCCimplemented new rules that said phone sex providers would have adefense from prosecution for providing indecent material if theydid one of the following: required up-front credit card payment;scrambled their messages or used access codes. The companies alsowere required to ask phone companies to identify the charges oncustomers' phone bills.   Those rules were in effect for a short period until Congress,fearing that enterprising youths still could gain access totelephone sex messages, banned such services outright in April 1988.   But the Supreme Court rejected the ban, saying only obscenematerial could be banned.   Congress tried again in November 1989, a few months after theFCC fined a California company $600,000 for transmitting obscenephone messages. The mother of a 16-year-old boy complained that herson had placed more than 280 calls to various phone sex services ina 2{-month period in 1987.   The 1989 law reinstated FCC regulation of indecency. But, underthe prodding of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Congress added a newwrinkle: phone companies, where possible, must block access to sexmessage services unless a customer asks in writing to receive them.   Dial-a-porn services immediately labeled the Helms amendment atype of ``presubscription'' that would drive them out of business,and they sued the government. Several local Bell phone companiestold the FCC it was not feasible to selectively block adultservices.   Despite these challenges, the FCC readopted the 1987 rules _ andthe new ``reverse blocking'' dictum _ in June of this year.   The rules had been scheduled to go into effect last Wednesday,but the courts stayed them pending further study.   The New York federal judge, Robert P. Patterson, said the lawwas vague on what constituted indecency; it was not the leastrestrictive means available to accomplish the government'spurposes; and it would allow prior censorship without adequatesafeguards.</TEXT></DOC>
