LeMunyon, deputy assistant secretary for exportadministration.andM;&quot;Fewer than 3 percent of all applications take longer than the statutorylimits to process, and most of those applications are delayed due to factorssuch as obtaining government-to-government assurances or enforcementinvestigations,&quot; he said.andM;For the $3 million investment required to install the system.andP;  BXA has savedthe government and U.S.andP;  exporters about $7 million since installing Model204 in late 1984.andM;Throughout the early to mid-1980s, the Commerce Department annually receivedmore than 125,000 export license applications.andP;  Because of the volue ofapplications and the inefficient paper system, as many as 15 percent to 20percent of teh applications were lost, agency officials said.andP;  Virtually noneget lost now.andM;The system uses the Model 204 database management system andfourth-generation language.andM;&quot;We do not use any COBOL or any interface languages on the database,&quot; said ahigh-ranking official in the BXA Computer Services Division who asked not tobe identified.andM;Model 204 lies at the heart of two BXA systems, the Export LicenseApplication and Information Network (ELAIN), and the System for TrackingExport License Applications (STELA).andM;In 1984, before installing the system, BXA processed license applications for$50 billion worth of exports.andP;  Last year, the agency processed applicationsfor $202 billion in exports, the BXA official said.andM;Model 204 resides on an IBM 3081 mainframe at a Commerce Department site inSpringfield, Va.andP;  Model 204 manages a BXA licensing database of 6 gigabytes,which contains 15 million records culled from 1.5 million licenses andthousands of license applications, said Bruce Triner, director of Computercorporation of America's Federal Operations.andM;Licensing officers get access to the Model 204 information on ELAIN throughPCs linked in a token-ring network to the mainframe and two Harris Corp. 9600UNIX servers, Triner said.andM;A UNIX system also handles the system's entry point.andP;  A Sun Microsystems Inc.andO;workstation connected to the network empowers the optical character readersystem that puts the license application data into the system.andP;  The systemuploads this information to the mainframe and prepares it for the licensingofficers.andM;STELA, a voice system managed by Model 204, lets exporters find theirapplications within the BXA approval process.andP;  Exporters enter their licenseapplication numbers on push-button phones and receive digitized voiceresponses.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
