(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Mary MannandM;Many buyers value the color displays provided with their portable computers,although others have decided to wait for the technology to reach a higherlevel.andM;Douglas Finn, district sales manager for National Instruments Corp., anAustin, Texas, firm that provides hardware and software interfaces forscientific equipment, uses Modgraph Inc.'s GX-2386C-CA portable because itscolor display improves client demonstrations.andM;&quot;I was using andlsqb;Compaq Computer Corp.'sandrsqb; Portable 386 LCD display, and it was aproblem demonstrating to different customers.andP;  The monochrome screen was hardto view,&quot; Finn said, &quot;especially with fluorescent lighting, which washed outthe display -- customers had to come close to see andlsqb;the screenandrsqb;.&quot;andM;The addition of color makes customers more excited about the NationalInstruments software, according to Finn.andM;Not all buyers, however, are pleased with the quality of the color screensprovided with portable PCs.andP;  David Billingsley, a senior engineer at StarEnterprise, an oil refining and marketing company in Delaware City, Del.,andO;evaluated Toshiba America Inc.'s T5200C and said its screen did not meet hiscompany's standards for screen quality.andM;When using Software Publishing Corp.'s Harvard Graphics, Billingsley said,the Toshiba screen's &quot;pixel count wasn't high enough for a professionalpresentation.andP;  The screen did not provide as high quality as a true VGAscreen, which it supposedly emulates.&quot; Therefore, Star Enterprise executiveshave opted to wait for the next generation of color portables.andM;At golf-course design firm Lee Trevino/ Wm.andP;  Graves Inc., users experienceimage ghosting with the T5200C, but they are generally pleased with theportable's on-screen image, according to company Treasurer Joseph Salinas.andM;&quot;During client presentations we're drawing many different lines and usingdifferent colors,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;And the customer is looking over our shoulders,so we need to display the best image.&quot;andM;Salinas said ghosting only appears from an angular view.andP;  &quot;The image is alittle vague from an angular view,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Instead, what we do is havethe client stand behind the screen or hook up the Toshiba portable to anotherandlsqb;desktopandrsqb; monitor.&quot;andM;As president of Chroma Corp., a software development firm in East Syracuse,N.Y., Guy Roe said the portability and quality color screen of the ModgraphGX-2386C-CA suit his needs.andM;&quot;The screen is super-clear compared with any other Trinitron monitors, suchas Sony andlsqb;Corp.andP;  of America'sandrsqb; 1304,&quot; Roe said.andP;  &quot;The 0.25 dot pitch providesa very fine picture.&quot;andM;Roe added that one prospective client is considering using the GX-2386C withChroma software to show listings to home buyers, instead of conductingprimary house viewings.andM;&quot;This saves time and money for the real estate firm,&quot; he said, &quot;and the agentcan show the buyers the homes in the comfort of their own home.andP;  The agentcan dial in to the program with a modem from the buyer's home.&quot;andM;Roe explained that the GX-2386C's resolution provides a clear and detailedimage.andM;&quot;With the andlsqb;GX-2386C screen'sandrsqb; 800-by-600-pixel resolution, 20 stamp-sizedhouses can be displayed on the screen,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I can see the andlsqb;houses'andrsqb;colors, windows and doors; the image is very clear.andP;  Portables I looked atfrom NEC and Sharp can't come near the Modgraph's detail.&quot;andM;To design golf courses worldwide, Salinas said the T5200C's portabilityprovides greater travel and presentation flexibility than his Macintoshworkstation.andM;&quot;We realized that we needed on-site portability,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With theToshiba, we can travel freely without plans, and make any changes or add moregraphics at the client presentations.&quot;andM;Salinas explained that he was also looking for a portable computer thatsupported a modem.andP;  &quot;We wanted a computer that we could use as a terminal--with a modem -- so that we would be able to send information via modem backto the Dallas office from another country.&quot;andM;National Instruments' Finn said the GX-2386C-CA provides him with ahigh-quality screen image in a 26-pound package.andM;&quot;Other sales personnel must lug around a monitor, which weighs about 45pounds, to provide color,&quot; Finn said.andP;  He said his firm is now consideringpurchasing more Modgraph portables to condense the carrying load.andM;Along with many other buyers, Finn suggested that computer manufacturersprovide more expansion capacity.andM;He said the GX-2386C could be improved by slightly elongating the case toaccommodate more slots.andP;  If the case was elongated, Finn said, the currentthree-quarter and half-length slots could become full-length slots.andM;Roe agreed: &quot;Right now I'm using an I/O board, a SCSI board and a compressionboard for VGA.andP;  I could always use more slots.&quot;andM;----------Editor's Note: PC Week was unable to contact buyers of NEC TechnologiesInc.'s ProSpeed CSX.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
