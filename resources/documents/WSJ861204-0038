Some industries do seem moribund, of course, but many others now turn out more products at relatively less cost than ever before. And this strength isn't just due to a blip in the business cycle.    &quot;People seem to think that manufacturing is dead in the water,&quot; says James F. Smith, senior economist at the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Texas, &quot;but nearly half of the major industries are doing very well indeed.&quot;    However, the brighter picture does have its darker hues: Some important industries are being left in the dust, and since the current business expansion began in late 1982, the manufacturing sector has generated relatively few new jobs. But if you regard manufacturing from the perspective of efficiency -- the economy's ability to produce goods and services with minimal effort -- the sector has achieved a striking measure of success.    A few statistics help to trace this Jekyll-Hyde relationship. Since November 1982, when the recession hit bottom, the number of manufacturing jobs has increased less than 6%. Looked at another way, total payroll employment has grown by more than 12 million, but less than one million of the gain has come in manufacturing. Yet manufacturing output, as measured by the Federal Reserve Board's index, has increased nearly 30% since late 1982.    The contrast this year is even more striking. Factory jobs have dwindled 200,000 since last December, but the output of manufacturing plants has nonetheless continued to expand, though only by 1%.    This pattern is clearly illustrated even in the beleaguered motor-vehicle industry, which, rather than simply complain about imports, has pushed cost cutting hard. From 1980 through 1985, industry employment rose only 11% while U.S. car and truck output grew 44% to 11.5 million units. This year, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates estimates, man-hours worked in the industry will fall 3.2% while output per hour will rise 5.3%.    For years, politicians and economists have been calling on American companies to become more productive to help hold down inflation and to make the U.S. a real competitor in international markets. So far, only the manufacturers seem to be having much success. From 1981 through 1985, output per man-hour in manufacturing grew 4.1% a year, a sharp improvement from the 1.3%-a-year gain in the 1973-81 period. In general, U.S. manufacturing &quot;is making long strides toward becoming competitive,&quot; says Lynn O. Michaelis, the chief economist at Weyerhaeuser Co.    The overall economy, in contrast, remains sluggish. Inflation-adjusted gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the third quarter, an improvement from the second quarter's 0.6% rate but hardly a vigorous performance. And overall productivity gains have been weak. Alan Greenspan, an economic adviser to President Ford, notes that &quot;from 1981 through our projection for 1986, output per man-hour in the nonfarm business sector grew at an average annual rate of less than 1.2%.&quot;    Some analysts think that manufacturing, with its increased efficiency, will begin to contribute more to the economy's health. Robert G. Dederick, the chief economist of Chicago's Northern Trust Co., offers a widely held assessment: &quot;The industrial sector is stabilizing rather than going into a cumulative down spin.&quot;    Growing manufacturing productivity has long-term implications. Audrey Freeman of the Conference Board, a research organization, says the labor force will continue expanding until the end of the century, although more slowly than in the 1970s. But jobs for new workers, she says, will come almost entirely from the service industries, not manufacturing.    This change will mean major, often highly painful, adjustments for new and old workers and for businessmen -- even larger adjustments than they have been making. Many workers will either have to settle for lower-paying jobs in service businesses or have to get the education that will qualify them for something better.    During the current economic expansion, the gains in manufacturing productivity have been unusual in a number of ways. In contrast with the past, increases in output have played a minor role. Mr. Greenspan says the productivity gains have been &quot;achieved only by major cost cutting and staff reductions within many firms faced with stiff foreign competition.&quot;    In another way as well, the productivity gains have followed the usual pattern only in part. Traditionally, the big increases come early in the business expansion, as companies delay hiring new workers until they are confident that the expansion will last, and the gains dwindle as companies eventually do step up hiring.    That pattern held this time around -- but with a difference. &quot;A very strong performance in manufacturing since 1981 was offset to a considerable extent&quot; by two factors, says John W. Kendrick, a George Washington University economist. One was a marked slowing in growth of farm productivity, he says. The other, he adds, was practically no growth in productivity in the service sector.    Manufacturers have been forced to slash costs. They have found the world a difficult place, with growing imports, a severe recession and sharp changes in customer demands. Companies and industries have varied widely in the speed and success of their adjustment to change.    &quot;We know we face a highly competitive economy, so we've adjusted to it,&quot; says Mark H. Willes, the president of General Mills. &quot;We've done a lot of strategic thinking, and we intend to stick to what we know best -- the food business, restaurants, some specialty retailing. We've sold fashion operations and toys as too volatile.&quot;    So far, the changes seem to be working. In the company's Aug. 24 quarter, earnings rose 21% from a year earlier.    Also adjusting to change has been the household-appliances industry, which has long been marked by intense domestic competition. A special spur now is not actual imports but a fear of imports. &quot;Imports so far have centered on microwave ovens,&quot; says Ann Dahmer, the manager of forecasting and market analysis for Whirlpool Corp. &quot;We haven't seen a broad range of appliance imports.&quot; She isn't sure why but obviously likes it that way. The industry expects 1986 to be the third consecutive year of record sales.    Mark Hassenberg, an appliances analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities, says, &quot;Pricing remains difficult, but materials costs, labor, both direct and indirect, fringe benefits and energy expenses are not placing pressure on profitability. Those companies that invested to improve productivity are faring well.&quot; That includes practically everybody: In both 1985 and 1986, output per man-hour in the industry has increased.    Some other industries also have reason to be cheerful. &quot;Chemicals have been doing fairly well this year, compared with the rest of manufacturing,&quot; Charles Reeder, a former chief economist of Du Pont Co., says. &quot;For several years, the industry has focused on process improvement and has become highly efficient; so, it hasn't lost business to imports.&quot; Another chemicals analyst estimates that in terms of production facilities, the industry is, on the average, &quot;about five years old.&quot;    Paper and other forest products are prospering, too. Mary Authors, a Union Camp Corp. economist, says, &quot;The paper business used to reflect general business. Yet general business has been very sluggish, while the box side of our business has been doing extremely well. We've been trying to understand that.&quot;    Weyerhaeuser, another forest-products concern, weathered a six-week strike to force workers to accept wage cuts averaging 20%. Mr. Michaelis, the company's economist, thinks that the cost-cutting maneuver is working well: &quot;We've keyed wage concessions to profits. If profits rise above a threshold, employees share in them. We've seen an increase in employee suggestions for improving productivity.&quot;    Imports stir complaints even when they affect only a part of a company's business. One reason Weyerhaeuser sought wage concessions, Mr. Michaelis comments, &quot;was to be able to compete more effectively against Canadian lumber imports.&quot; A further complication: Weyerhaeuser itself has lumber operations in Canada.    The textile industry's major problem, according to George Wino, the chief economist of the Textile Manufacturers Institute, &quot;is that our big customer industry -- apparel -- has gone offshore. You don't ship textiles from here to Taiwan to produce clothing. Apparel was once 40% of our business. Now, it's 35% and falling fast.&quot; But smaller product lines, such as floor coverings, are doing well. Through it all, Mr. Wino adds, textile companies have struggled to become more competitive. &quot;In this industry,&quot; he says, &quot;people will cut each other's throat for a dime.&quot;    Many industries, of course, aren't coping with change, either because they waited too long to try or because demand for their product has changed. &quot;Specific businesses,&quot; Mr. Reeder says, &quot;have really been brutalized by imports.&quot;    A world-wide surplus of steel production, for example, has pushed down international prices, and despite import restraints, steel mills have been hit hard. In a list of 113 industries in the 1982-85 period, steel ranked 103rd in growth in value of production; its output fell at an annual rate of 4.24%. This year, Wharton Econometric estimates, steel mills slipped to 105th place, with output off nearly 7%.    Yet many &quot;minimills&quot; are thriving, producing steel for specialized needs and not for big-volume, low-profit customers such as auto companies. F. Kenneth Iverson, the chairman of Nucor Corp., the largest minimill company, contends that big steelmakers have put off modernization because of the seeming security provided by import curbs. &quot;Employees in the top five integrated firms are 30% less productive than steelworkers in Japan,&quot; he says. &quot;If their wages were reduced to Japanese levels, they still couldn't compete.&quot;    In today's business world, there is clearly a premium on agility, the ability to move in and out of fields as profit prospects change. IC Industries Inc. of Chicago is nothing if not agile. Established long ago as the Illinois Central Railroad, it has slimmed down its rail operations, which are now profitable, and acquired a variety of consumer and industrial products.    &quot;We've been doing a lot of things right,&quot; says Rick Preiss, IC's corporate economist. But even he worries about imports: &quot;They're a problem for our railroad. When you deal with imports, you lose half of the transportation services.&quot;    However, L.J. Burlingame, executive vice president of Twin Disc Corp., a Racine, Wis., producer of transmissions for mining and construction equipment, says, &quot;Our problem isn't strictly imports. Demand for heavy construction equipment has gone down around the world. In the countries that need big construction projects, people don't have the money to pay for them. The places that have the money, like the U.S., don't need the projects.&quot; This year, Twin Disc cut costs by closing a Rockford, Ill., plant, and consolidating operations in Racine, but it has reported losses nonetheless.    Although nearly all the manufacturers that have taken a beating profess to see hope somewhere down the road, the chairman of a Midwest producer of power systems isn't so sure. &quot;We've done everything we can think of to cut costs, and it may not be enough,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm afraid we face a depression, not a recession, and I don't know what will happen.&quot; He does know that he doesn't want his name disclosed.    ---             Average Annual Gains in Productivity                                1948-     1973-     1981-                                 1973      1981      1985  Business economy               2.9       0.6       1.1  Farming                        4.6       5.2       2.8  Nonfarm sector                 2.4       0.4       1.0  Manufacturing                  2.8       1.3       4.1  Durable                        2.4       1.1       4.7  Nondurable                     3.4       1.7       3.2  Nonmanufacturing               2.2       0         0   Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department ofLabor                      Value of Output                                            4Q '85                                1982-85    -4Q '86  Motor vehicles                 19.15%     -2.73%  Building materials             19.03      -1.53  Appliances                      9.26       1.69  Steel Mills                    -4.24      -6.92  Aircraft                        9.93       3.95  Radio-TV                       10.53       7.75  Pulp, paperboard                4.46       6.57  Paperboard Boxes                0.56       8.71  Farm machinery                 -5.86      -6.20  Newspapers, books               2.00       7.37  Apparel                        -0.44       4.25  House furniture                12.52      -2.53  Drugs, soaps                   -1.66       9.20  Beverages                      -0.19       8.92  Scientific instruments          5.07       3.73   Sources: Commerce Department; Wharton Economic ForecastingAssociates</TEXT></DOC>
