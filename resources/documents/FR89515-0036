The assessmentprovides a basis for the conclusion that the field testing of these geneticallyengineered tomato plants will not present a risk of introduction or disseminationof a plant and will not have any significant impact on the quality of thehuman environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Inspection Service(APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessment and,when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing a permitfor the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR22906).Monsanto Agricultural Company, of Chesterfield, Missouri, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment, to fieldtest genetically engineered tomato plants modified to express the delta-endotoxinprotein from <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis </T3>to enable the plants to produce a proteinthat is toxic to larval feeding of select lepidopteran insects.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tomato plant under the conditions describedin the Monsanto Agricultural Company application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Monsanto Agricultural Company, as well asa review of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. An insecticidal gene <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>has been inserted into tomato chromosome in a way thatwould allow the biosynthesis of delta-endotoxin. In nature, genetic materialcontained in the chromosomes of tomato plants can only be transferred toanother sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination and fertilization.In this field trial the introduced genes cannot spread to another plantby cross-pollination, because the field test plot is located at a sufficientdistance from any sexually compatible plants with which these experimentaltomato plants could cross-pollinate.2. Neither the delta-endotoxin gene nor its polypeptide product conferson tomato any plant pest characteristics. <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>var. <T3>kurstaki </T3>from which the delta-endotoxin gene was obtained is alsonot a plant pest.3. The delta-endotoxin gene does not provide the transformed tomato plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed tomato plantsin its ability to be dispersed or to become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the delta-endotoxin gene to tomato plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom the DNA of a tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid with known plant pathogenicpotential, has been disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary for pathogenicityhave been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and shownto be nonpathogenic to susceptible plants.5. The vector agent used to deliver the chimeric vector DNA containingthe delta-endotoxin gene into the tomato plant cells is <T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens. </T3>The bacterial vector agent was eradicatedby the use of appropriate antibacterial antibiotics.6. Excision and horizontal movement of the stably integrated delta-endotoxingene into a plant genome (i.e. chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated.The vector simply delivers and inserts the gene into the tomato genome.The vector does not survive in or on any of the transformed plants. Therehas been no demonstration of a mechanism in nature to move an insertedgene from a chromosome of a transformed plant to any other organism exceptby pollination.7. There will be two separate tests; one to study resistance to tomatofruitworm, and the other to evaluate resistance tobacco hornworm. The sizeof the field test plot for the first experiment is small (0.6 acre with3,800 transgenic plants, 400 nontransgenic plant as controls) and for thesecond experiment will be 1,000 square feet (consisting of 200 transgenicplants and 25 nontransgenic controls).The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1978, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 9th day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
