The 10 major companies making cars and light trucks in theUnited States on Wednesday reported a 4.3 percent increase in trucksales, pushing total vehicle sales up 11.3 percent.   ``I think car sales may be benefiting from a shift in mix awayfrom trucks and toward cars,'' said auto analyst David Healy ofinvestment banker Barclays de Zoete Wedd of New York City. ``It'sthe only response I can detect to the higher gasoline prices.''   Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and theaccompanying rocketing of gasoline prices, automakers have saidthey weren't seeing a shift from large, gas-gulping cars tosmaller, more fuel-efficient cars as they saw in the oil crises ofthe 1970s.   In the '80s, the popularity of trucks, including compactpickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, soared. But truckstypically aren't as economical as cars and now, analysts say, thelure of trucks may be waning.   ``I kind of have a suspicion that the guy who has been buying atruck as his primary personal transportation vehicle is opting outof that vehicle and moving back to a passenger car,'' auto analystJoseph Pillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers said Wednesday.   He said another factor may be that cars bought in the boom yearsof the mid-1980s are getting old, have been paid for and are primefor replacement.   ``They are starting to age out and reach their appointed hourfor trade-in time,'' Pillippi said.   The 10 major U.S. automakers said their cars and trucks sold atan average daily rate of 31,328 during Oct. 11-20, compared with28,156 in mid-October 1989.   Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and ChryslerCorp., rose 11.6 percent, one of the biggest year-to-year jumps of1990.   Sales of cars made in Japanese automakers' U.S. plants rose 42.2percent. The Big Three held 84.8 percent of the domesticallyproduced car market during the period.   The mid-October sales rate last year was depressed becauseconsumers who planned to buy cars in the last three months of theyear purchased their cars in September to take advantage ofincentives that expired Oct. 1.   With only a few exceptions, domestic car and truck sales thisyear have been lower than in 1989. Through Oct. 20, sales fell 4.2percent from 1989. Car sales for the year fell 4.6 percent andtruck sales dropped 3.5 percent.   GM's mid-October car sales rose 15.1 percent from 1989, andtruck sales rose 7.5 percent, combining for a 12.4 percent increasein vehicle sales. Through Oct. 20, GM's car and truck sales were4.6 percent lower than in 1989.   Ford's 9.3 percent increase in car sales combined with an 11.4percent rise in truck sales for a 10.1 percent increase in vehiclesales during the period. For the year, Ford's car and truck saleswere 8.6 percent behind 1989.   Chrysler's mid-October vehicle sales rate was 6.7 percent below1989 with a 5.6 percent increase in car sales offset by an 18.7percent decline in truck sales. Since Jan. 1, Chrysler's car andtruck sales have fallen 14.3 percent from 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
