Trades set a record for the third consecutive session, with an estimated 179,572 contracts topping Wednesday's previous high of 151,141, according to a spokeswoman for the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Trading was extreme volatile. At one early point, the price of January delivery oil dipped to $14.90 a barrel, the lowest level since Dec. 10, 1986. It represented a drop of $1.06 from Wednesday's close. A rally brought the price back to $15.84, a loss of only 12 cents a barrel.    The February contract swung over an even wider range, first dropping the daily limit of $1 a barrel (January has no limit), to $14.93, the only contract to do so, and then at one point recovering enough to range nine cents higher than Wednesday's close. Ultimately, the February contract settled at $15.71 a barrel, two cents below Wednesday's close.    Heating oil for January delivery rose 0.34 cent a gallon to 49.61 cents, while January gasoline was off 0.02 cent at 41.68 cents.    In the spot, or non-contract, market, the price for North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European crude, fell 70 cents a barrel to $15.70. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, in late trading was down 15 cents to $15.80 a barrel.    The continued plunge in prices prompted divergent opinions.    &quot;This market has been deeply oversold,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co. of New York. &quot;I think we will be hearing soon from OPEC, that an emergency meeting will be called to assess and do something to counter the current situation,&quot; he said.    Mr. Cardillo said he wasn't looking for a total collapse in prices. &quot;I think its ready to stabilize at $17 and then rise to $18 again,&quot; he said.    &quot;The fall continues because there is no word from OPEC. Absent that word, the decline will keep going,&quot; said Michael Smolinski, an economist at Data Resources Inc., Lexington, Mass. &quot;If OPEC remains silent, people are going to continue to sell the market on fears that OPEC is producing too much oil,&quot; he said.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of the New York-based newsletter, MidEast Report, said that the five major producers -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq -- are not inclined to cut output or do anything that will strengthen prices and favor Iran.    Separately, the Mercantile Exchange yesterday raised energy futures margins, or good-faith deposits to trade contracts, by $500 per contract for the second time this week. The new margins will be effective as of the close of business today. Initial minimum heating oil, gasoline and crude oil margins will be raised to $2,000 per contract for clearing members and to $2,500 per contract for customers, according to an exchange spokeswoman. </TEXT></DOC>
