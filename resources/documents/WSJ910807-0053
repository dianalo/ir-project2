GM said the price of its cheapest Chevrolet Cavalier willcarry a base price of $8,899 -- an increase of $904, or11.3%, from the 1991 price. Likewise, the similar PontiacSunbird will get a price boost of $936, or 10.8%, to $9,620without optional equipment.</LP><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp., meanwhile, is planning for relativelysmall price increases on many of its cars and its base-modelminivans. However, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker is settinglarger price increases on its more profitable minivans andJeep Cherokee models.   Chrysler has practically no new products this fall andseems to be hoping its strategy will stabilize its weakeningcar sales until its first new sedans in a decade arrive latenext year.   Much of GM's price increase is to cover the cost of a newantilock braking system, which automatically provides pumpingaction to the brakes to avoid wheel lockups and skids on wetor icy roads. Antilock brakes are now found mostly on luxuryand high-performance cars, but GM has developed a new system-- called ABS VI -- that it believes will put the pricewithin reach of average buyers.   But it's far from clear whether the buyers themselves willagree, especially those in the very price-sensitive marketfor basic compact cars. &quot;They aren't going to be able togenerate a whole lot of {customer} traffic with double-digitprice increases,&quot; said John Casesa, automotive analyst ofWertheim Schroeder andamp; Co.   GM, however, characterized its new prices as a moderate3.1% increase over its entire model line, when measuredagainst comparably equipped 1991 models. That means anyequipment that was optional last year but becomes standardthis year isn't counted by GM as a price increase.   For example, the Buick Regal will have power door locksand intermitent windshield wipers as standard equipment in1992. Currently, both these features are options. As aresult, the cheapest 1992 Buick Regal will rise $920 to$16,610. That's a base-price increase of 5.8% from the 1991Regal, although GM would consider the price increase to befar less than that.   The base price of the Buick LeSabre will jump 9.5% to$18,695. The car is being redesigned from last year, and thebig price increase reflects that, according to a GMspokesman.   GM is pioneering new ground in putting antilock brakes oncars with relatively low price tags, but its major competitoralso is slating aggressive price increases for this fall.Ford Motor Co. included some substantial increases on itspreliminary 1992-model prices disclosed two weeks ago.   For example, the base price of the cheapest Taurus sedanis slated to increase 7% to almost $15,000. The Taurus isn'tgetting standard antilock brakes, although the exterior andinterior styling are being changed.   All of the Big Three are under pressure to reverseenormous losses in the North American market. &quot;We're tryingto do the best we can to return this company toprofitability,&quot; said a GM spokesman. But he added that theauto maker also wants to increase its market share andintends to keep its car prices competitive.   Thus, whether the price increases stick depends largelyupon the response of the Japanese auto makers. Toyota MotorCorp. and Honda Motor Co. are launching new versions of theirCamry and Civic models, respectively, this fall. But neithercompany has yet announced prices for these key models.Yesterday, GM didn't disclose the price of some vehicles thatwill compete against them -- notably the new Pontiac Grand Amand the Saturn cars.   Chrysler didn't provide a full breakdown on prices for its1992 models. The auto maker said its prices will increase1.4% from comparably equipped 1991 models now on dealer lots.   A Chrysler spokesman said the tentative price of the base1992-model Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan minivans willrise to $13,706. That's $258, or 1.9%, above the base priceof 1991 models now being sold. The increase is larger forbetter-equipped minivans: base prices for 1992-modelextended-body Voyager and Caravan LE models will jump $1,169,or 6%, to $20,773.   Chrysler plans to boost the price of the 1992 JeepCherokee four-door base model with four-wheel-drive to$16,842, up $1,021, or 6.5%, from the base price for asimilar 1991 model.   Base prices for Chrysler's least-expensive cars, the DodgeShadow America and Plymouth Sundance America, will increase$285, or 3.7%, to $7,984. The auto maker's most-expensivemodel, the Chrysler Imperial, will carry a base price of$28,453. That's $1,334, or 4.9%, higher than the 1991-modelImperial's base price.   Chrysler lowered the tentative base price of one model --the Chrysler LeBaron sedan -- by $877, or 5.3%, to $15,710.The company plans to use the less costly LeBaron to replacethe high-end Plymouth Acclaim this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
