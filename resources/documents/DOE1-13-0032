<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0032 </DOCNO><TEXT>Hatch Associates were retained to provide a pre-evaluation of the potentialfor increasing the efficiency of oil and gas utilization in foundries.The plant chosen produces ductile cast iron pressure pipes for waterdistribution systems. Approximately 62% of losses are through the fluegases. A central recuperator to pre-heat combustion air and improve controlswould have a total installed cost of $276,100 and annual operating savingsof $132,900 with a resultant payback of 2.1 years. Improvements to thecombustion control, and an exhaust gas system for regulating furnacepressure would cost about $210,00 with a payback of 2.0 years. This optionis an alternative to the recuperator option. Another alternative is aregenerative burner system which would have a total cost of $461,300and a payback of 3.0 years. A brief survey was conducted of the potentialfor application of these energy conservation measures to other Canadianfoundries. A demonstration project to illustrate the benefits of wasteheat recovery will be vital in encouraging other foundries to use wasteheat recovery in reducing energy costs.</TEXT></DOC>
