An interim debt agreement expires on June 30, 1990, and SouthAfrica's white-controlled government is faced with payments of atleast $8 billion by 1991 unless new terms are established.   The four clergymen said bankers should negotiate a new agreementonly in exchange for government promises to lift the state ofemergency, free political prisoners, lift bans on oppositiongroups, repeal discriminatory laws and begin talks on granting fullpolitical rights to blacks.   ``Without such linkage, rescheduling will amount to an extensionof time and credit to the apartheid regime to continue brutalizingthe oppressed majority in South Africa,'' said a letter released bythe South African Council of Churches.   The letter was signed by Tutu, the first black leader of theAnglican Church in southern Africa; the Rev. Frank Chikane, blackgeneral-secretary of the church council; the Rev. Allan Boesak,mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches;and the Rev. Beyers Naude, a veteran white anti-apartheid activist.   The clergymen also recommended that trade credits to SouthAfrica be suspended and that banks halt gold loans, in which SouthAfrica uses its gold reserves as collateral.   Two weeks ago, the head of the Reserve Bank of South Africa,Gerhard de Kock, warned that the country's economy faced stagnationunless there was ``adequate progress in the field of political andconstitutional reform.''   His cautiously worded speech was viewed as confirmation that a4-year-old freeze on new loans to South Africa has seriously harmedthe economy. Since 1985, several billion dollars has left SouthAfrica, without replacement, to pay off old debts and purchaseimports.   Since de Kock's speech, the economy has been battered evenfurther by the falling price of gold, by far the country's mostimportant export.   The loan freeze has had more impact on South Africa than otherforms of economic sanctions. Most foreign companies which havewithdrawn from South Africa have sold their holdings at favorableterms to local executives, and exports of coal, steel and farmproduce have been sustained despite embargoes by the U.S. and someWestern European countries.   Tutu and his colleagues have been criticized harshly by whitesand conservative blacks for their advocacy of sanctions. Thecritics claim sanctions will harden white attitudes while causingharm primarily to poor blacks.   The four anti-apartheid leaders, on a visit to the United Statesearlier this month, launched a new campaign seeking to targeteconomic pressure more specifically.   ``We did not go (to Washington) to ask for more sanctions,''Tutu said in a speech Wednesday night. ``We went to ask for help toget negotiations going that would bring an end to apartheid and tousher in the new South Africa.''</TEXT></DOC>
