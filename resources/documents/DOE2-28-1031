Ironically,many of the contemporary Soviet statements on mutual security and interdependenceecho prevailing Western views of the early 1970s. In response to a seriesof aggressive projections of political-military power by the Sovietsin the mid-to-late 1970s which culminated in the invasion of Afghanistan,the West - and especially the United States - quickly shed this rhetoricand downplayed arms control and collaborative security approaches. Whilethe West remains transfixed by a late-1970s image of Soviet power, theSoviets are adopting approaches comparable to those widespread in theWest in the early 1970s. To break this cycle, both sides must adapt creativelyto the break that Gorbachev is making with important aspects of the Sovietpast. The West can test the seriousness of Soviet initiatives by encouragingMoscow to continue developing negotiable proposals and practical approachesto issues of common security. 5 references</TEXT></DOC>
