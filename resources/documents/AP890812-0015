Curtis Beseda, already serving 20 years in a Texas federalprison for setting fire to the Feminist Women's Health Center inEverett, also violated the racketeering statute through arson andextortion aimed at the abortion clinic, the jury concluded.   The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983and April 1984, then closed its doors. Beseda earlier told the juryhe had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell himto do it.   He and protesters Dottie Roberts and Sharon Codispoti, both ofLake Stevens, were found to have conspired to violate theracketeering statute.   Beseda was ordered to pay $268,500 in civil damages whileBeseda, Roberts and Codispoti will share another $11,000 fine. Alldamages can be trebled.   Two other defendants, Bonnie and Michael Undseth of Snohomish,were acquitted. Jurors in Judge Thomas Zilly's court deliberated 3{days before reaching a verdict in the month-long trial.   The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute,intended to fight organized crime, has been used against abortionprotesters.   Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the FeministWomen's Health Center of Yakima, parent clinic to the one thatburned.   Roberts' lawyer Theresa Schrempp promised an appeal. Roberts,holding her young grandson Timothy, said she thinks the jury wasconfused by the complexity of the case, involving 52 pages of juryinstructions.   ``It's a perversion of the First Amendment,'' she said. ``Thisone's going to the Supreme Court.'' She said the plaintiffs ``won'tget anything out of me ... because I don't have anything.''   In Philadelphia, the case that set precedent in the Seattle casewas upheld on appeal in March and defendants have asked the U.S.Supreme Court to hear it.   Twenty-six individuals were found guilty of multiple acts ofextortion at an abortion clinic there. The clinic was awarded$100,000.   Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged Beseda and the otherdefendants conspired to shut down the clinic by arson, personal andtelephone harassment of patients and staff, blocking access to andfrom the clinic, picketing and helping Beseda escape to Canada.   A successful action under the racketeering statute must show anenterprise adversely affects interstate commerce and engages in apattern of racketeering, meaning a serious violation of the lawsuch as arson, extortion, wire fraud, robbery, kidnapping ormurder, said Edmond Tiryak, the civil rights attorney who tried thePhiladelphia case.</TEXT></DOC>
