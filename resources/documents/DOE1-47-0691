Some favors counterforce targeting,on the assumption that such a policy of aiming at military and commandstructures of the enemy would minimize casualties, especially when comparedto countervalue targeting. The author doubts that this view is basedon solid evidence;even in counterforce targeting, he contends, enormousnumbers of innocents will be slaughtered. In fact, he seems highly skepticalabout whether any deterrence strategy can ever be morally acceptable.Perhaps a counterforce capability with a low ceiling on quantity mightjust barely squeak through. This would avoid an endless arms buildupbecause each country would not feel that it had to match an increaseby the other. Thus, the relentless competition endemic to a counterforceposture could be avoided. Under such a limited counterforce doctrine,America's nuclear arsenal might be safely reduced by 90 per cent. Thus,the author sees himself in something of a compromise position betweenthose who argue that a limited force of perhaps two thousand warheadsis not enough militarily and those who contend that it is too much morally.</TEXT></DOC>
