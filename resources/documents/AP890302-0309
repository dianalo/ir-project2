Corn and oat futures also advanced but wheat futures retreatedfollowing Wednesday's runup on rumors, which were confirmedThursday, that the Soviet Union had purchased 485,000 metric tons ofU.S. wheat at subsidized prices.   On other markets Thursday, energy futures surged; livestock andmeat advanced; copper futures gained; and precious metals werenarrowly mixed.   Soybeans settled 11{ cents to 20{ cents higher with the contractfor delivery in March at $7.67{ a bushel; wheat was 2 cents to 3}cents lower with March at $4.36\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3}cents higher with March at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 6cents higher with March at $2.08} a bushel.   Unconfirmed rumors of Soviet plans to purchase U.S. corn andpossibly some soybean meal touched off the late rally on the Boardof Trade, analysts said.   The reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market,which has become increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybeansupplies have tightened _ a function of last summer's drought.   ``In the face of no current supplies and users all beinghand-to-mouth, the market can blow up on you,'' said Cathy Leow, agrain market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in NewYork. ``Whenever you get a little demand at all, it explodes.''   Traders said the rally accelerated after the May soybean contractsurpassed $7.75 a bushel, triggering waves of computer-drivenspeculative fund buying.   The supply tightness is expected to ease in mid-April when theSouth American soybean harvest begins.   But U.S. weather concerns may have taken precedence by then asthe market weighs the prospects for a second year of drought.   ``If the weather is good we'll have trouble going much higher; ifthe weather's bad, we'll go a lot higher,'' said Victor Lespinasse,a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.   Energy futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchangefollowing reports that non-OPEC countries, including the SovietUnion and China, may cut their crude-oil exports by about 400,000barrels per day in the second quarter.

The cutbacks, which have not been officially announced, wouldsupport the efforts of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries to bolster oil prices.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 44 centshigher with April at $18.72 a barrel; heating oil was .84 cent to1.38 cent higher with April at 51.87 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .45 cent to .65 cent higher with April at 52.21 cents agallon.
