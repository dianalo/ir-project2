Twelve years ago is ancient history here, where 1,000 new residents pour into the state each day and the Republican Party has nearly doubled in size since 1980. Yet Florida is shaping up as a critical Super Tuesday showdown for GOP presidential rivals George Bush and Robert Dole -- and each can argue he has history on his side.    This state has gone with the winners of the New Hampshire primary every time since Republican Gerald Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter won here in 1976. That's George Bush's argument, one backed by the firepower of money and a solid organization. &quot;Florida is second only to Texas for us, in importance and in strength,&quot; says J.L. Morgan III, Mr. Bush's deputy southern political director. &quot;New Hampshire has turned our press around. We're just trying to stay on top of the wave.&quot;    But what saved then-President Ford from Ronald Reagan's clutches in 1976 were the phalanxes of fellow Midwesterners who'd retired here. Retired Midwesterners are now the hope of Kansas Sen. Dole, who needs a strong Florida showing to offset a likely Bush win in Texas.    &quot;Florida certainly is one of our top priority Super Tuesday states,&quot; says David Keene, a top Dole political strategist. &quot;Bush has a lot of advantages there -- the governor's support, his son's involvment in (Florida) politics -- so if we can sting him there it'll have a big impact.&quot;    But Florida is also an expensive, high-stakes gamble. This state awards 64 of its 82 GOP delegates to the winners in the various congressional districts. In each district, the winner takes all; the statewide winner gets an additional 18 delegates. &quot;You could do darn well -- lose each district by only one vote -- and still come out with zero delegates,&quot; worries Rockie Pennington, executive director of the senator's Florida campaign.    This GOP battleground is the least southern state in the South -- and, after Texas, the one with the most Super Tuesday delegates. It's a volatile mix of change and growth and kinetic energy, just one step ahead of chaos.    Heavily Cuban Miami has the look and feel of Havana; St. Petersburg, packed with those Midwesterners, votes like Akron, Ohio. Hollywood, Fla., is a Jewish stronghold, Tarpon Springs has Greeks, and one Tampa newspaper publishes in Italian, Spanish and English.    &quot;If Florida were a psychiatric patient, it would be defined as having multiple personalities,&quot; says University of Florida political scientist Kenneth Wald. &quot;There is almost every conceivable voting bloc in the United States here.&quot;    In such a state, it seems only appropriate that David Zachem, Florida coordinator for GOP candidate Pat Robertson, is the grandson of Lebanese Maronites and Kentucky Southern Baptists. Just before the New Hampshire vote came in, Mr. Zachem was declaring George Bush &quot;dead in the bed.&quot; He was also predicting a surprising Robertson showing here on March 8. But Mr. Robertson faces a special difficulty in Florida: Unlike most other southern states, Democrats here can't cross over to vote in the GOP primary.    When the New Hampshire vote did come in, the mood at Bush headquarters was one of relief and jubilation. &quot;Big Mo!&quot; exulted Mr. Morgan, resurrecting a phrase last heard about eight years ago. Of course, Mr. Bush himself talked of Big Mo(mentum) in 1980 -- just before Ronald Reagan buried him in New Hampshire. But this year New Hampshire stopped a Bush slide, at least temporarily. Now the Bush camp is counting on a superior southern organization to reap a Super Tuesday harvest.    &quot;Dole doesn't have a deep organization in the South,&quot; maintains Kenneth Wright, the Bush Florida campaign director. &quot;That's where New Hampshire hurts him the most. He had to keep feeding the notion that Bush was vulnerable.&quot;    Here in Florida, the Bush hopes start in Miami -- heavily Cuban and cultivated for years by Florida Secretary of Commerce Jeb Bush, the vice president's son. So fiercely anti-communist are these Cuban-Americans that Miami may be the one place in the country where the vice president would be helped by revelations of deeper involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal.    Among the vice president's backers is a man who infiltrated Fidel Castro's Cuba in a rubber boat weeks before the Bay of Pigs. State Rep. Javier Souto predicts that, as of today, Mr. Bush could &quot;easily&quot; take three-fourths of Florida's Cuban vote. But he worries that Mr. Robertson may whittle away Bush strength with his controversial charge that Cuba remains a site for Soviet missiles, pointed north.    &quot;That kind of talk is good music to Cuban ears,&quot; he explains, illustrating one of those little ironies in which Florida abounds. &quot;It shows Robertson is involved with Cuba.&quot;    There's a suspicion in the Bush camp that the Dole and Robertson campaigns are tacitly cooperating -- each conceding certain areas to the other in order to focus on the vice president. &quot;The Dole people are looking for help here, and the Robertson people are their only way to go,&quot; maintains Mr. Morgan.    The Dole campaign is targeting southwest Florida and its belt of Midwestern retirees. Another target is Broward County, part of the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; on the Atlantic. A third priority is northern Florida's Jacksonville area, where campaign director Pennington sees Sen. Dole still behind but gaining.    The X-factor in the Republican race is Mr. Robertson. His Florida coordinator, Mr. Zachem, claims significant inroads into Bush strength among Miami-area Cubans. &quot;We have stolen Dade County from Bush,&quot; he told a houseful of campaign workers watching the New Hampshire returns. Bush aides dismiss such talk as pure hyperbole. Be that as it may, Mr. Robertson is also thought to have strength in the northern panhandle counties below Georgia and Alabama. But Jack Kemp is targeting the panhandle too, along with Miami Hispanics and selected pockets in booming mid-Florida.    The northern panhandle is a lonesome anomaly in modern Florida: Although it's the area most like the traditional South, it's the least like Florida. Decades ago, John Gunther, that profiler of states and of nations, could write that the South &quot;is full of people whose only profession is to be southerners.&quot; In Florida today, that description would apply mainly in the northern counties -- and maybe not even there.    More typical is midstate's Interstate-4 corridor, which swings just south of this university town en route from Tampa through Orlando to Daytona Beach. The I-4 belt has proved decisive in some statewide elections, including Gerald Ford's 1976 primary victory over Ronald Reagan.    There's nothing traditional about this disjointed landscape of suburbs, fast-food restaurants, theme parks and shopping malls. But it appears to be Florida's future -- and, like the state as a whole, it's reinventing itself every day.    ---   Results of Recent GOP Presidential Primaries in Florida    1976                  Gerald Ford                  53%                          Ronald Reagan                47%    1980                  Ronald Reagan                56%                          George Bush                  30%                          Others                       14%    1984                  Uncontested   Source: Congressional Quarterly Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
