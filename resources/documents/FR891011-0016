As mentioned earlier, the requirements for tobaccoprocessing and synthetic fiber manufacturing will be addressed in separateNotices. The RACT requirements pertaining to aluminum rolling mills areapplicable to Reynolds Metals-Foil Plant, located in Richmond, VA. TheRichmond ozone nonattainment area, which currently includes Richmond City,and Chesterfield and Henrico Counties, received a State ImplementationPlan (SIP) call on September 28, 1984. A SIP call is a finding made byEPA under section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Clean Air Act that the State's planfor attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS is substantially inadequateto attain and maintain that standard. Virginia was required to submit,as part of its compliance with the SIP call, RACT requirements for anynon-CTG sources which have the potential to emit &quot;100 TPY VOC emissions.One of the sources which Virginia identified is the Reynolds Metals-FoilPlant. This is the only source in the Richmond nonattainment area whichhas been identified in the aluminum rolling source category and is theonly source which will be affected by the adoption of the aluminum rollingmills requirements.The aluminum rolling mills requirement is in the form of a Consent Orderfor the Reynolds Metals-Foil Plant, dated December 21, 1987, and requiresthe Company to use a normal paraffin lubricant containing a minimum of88 percent saturated aliphatic compounds or carbon range of C12 and above.Compliance is determined by a gas chromatograph analysis of a grab sampletaken at any rolling mill at the plant and compared to a copy of a gaschromatograph submitted to Virginia and incorporated as part of this Order.In addition, the temperature of the normal paraffin lubricant is requiredto be controlled and maintained at or below 150 anddegrees;F. Recordkeepingby the Company is required in order to show that the lubricant temperatureis maintained daily and that the gas chromatograph analysis of the lubricantis performed each month. These records are required to be maintained fortwo years. The Reynolds Metals-Foil Plant had previously been using keroseneas a lubricant in its rolling mills. Kerosene is more volatile than theproposed substitute lubricant. Reynolds Metals has conducted its own teststo show that the lubricant substitute will make an acceptable product andhas committed to making the change in its process.While the information provided by Virginia has not excluded carbon adsorptionor incineration as RACT for other similar metal rolling operations, EPAbelieves that the documentation provided by Virginia and Reynolds Metalsregarding lubricant substitution sufficiently supports a RACT determinationfor aluminum rolling at the Reynolds Metals-Foil Plant in Richmond. Carbonadsorption, oil absorption, incineration, and lubricant substitution wereall shown to be technically and economically feasible. The cost per tonVOC removed among the four control options varied by a factor of 10. Whilethis variation in cost did not exclude any of the control options, lubricantsubstitution would provide the most continuous and dependable control ofVOC compared with the other options. Lubricant substitution offers theability to minimize the VOC emissions of the process at the outset ratherthan to abate the VOC emissions after it is already produced.In the cold (temperatures below 100anddegrees;C) aluminum rolling process,several factors in the choice of the lubricant are important. These includethe requirement that the lubricant should have a high specific heat tocool the metal being rolled to the maximum extent, that the heat of vaporizationand the flash point are high to minimize evaporation of emissions and fires,respectively, and that the vapor pressure of the lubricant should be lowto minimize emissions. With regard to lowering VOC emissions, only thevapor pressure and heat of vaporization of the proposed lubricant substitute(C<T2>12</T2> or greater normal paraffin (high-purity linear paraffin)) directlyindicate the advantage of using the paraffin versus using kerosene. Thevapor pressure of a compound is the pressure of its aqueous vapor overwater in millimeters of mercury (Hg). The higher the vapor pressure, themore volatile the compound and the more VOC emissions it generates. Whenkerosene is used in aluminum rolling, the temperature at which the metalis rolled is 180anddegrees;F. At this temperature, the vapor pressure ofkerosene is 20 mm Hg. When a C<T2>12</T2> normal paraffin is used in aluminum rolling, the temperatureat which the metal is rolled is 150anddegrees;F. At this temperature, thevapor pressure of the C<T2>12</T2> normal paraffin is 8 mm Hg. The heat of vaporization is theamount of heat needed to change one gram of the liquid compound to vaporwithout changing the temperature. The higher the heat of vaporization,the more heat it takes to change the liquid compound to vapor at the sametemperature. The heat of vaporization is 139 Btu/lb for a high-purity linearparaffin compared with 110 Btu/lb for kerosene. The other properties ofthe proposed lubricant substitute illustrate why this lubricant substitutewill work in the aluminum rolling process. These other properties are thespecific heat and the flash point of the compound. The specific heat ofa compound is the amount of heat that a compound can hold compared withwater at 15anddegrees;C. A compound with a higher specific heat than anothercompound has more heat capacity than that other compound. The specificheat of a high-purity linear paraffin is 0.55 Btu/lb-anddegrees;F comparedwith 0.50 Btu/lb-anddegrees;F for kerosene. The flash point of a compoundis the temperature at which a compound ignites. The higher the flash pointof a compound, the greater degree of safety is provided. The flash pointsof C<T2>12</T2>-C<T2>15</T2> normal paraffins range for from 156anddegrees;F for a C<T2>12</T2> normal paraffin to 244anddegrees;F for a C<T2>15</T2> normal paraffin compared with 130anddegrees;F for kerosene. Theamount of VOC emissions reduced due to the substitution of the C<T2>12</T2> paraffin for the kerosene lubricant is estimated at 10-50%.Using lubricant substitution as the emission control method provides anadded advantage not available if add-on control devices are chosen as themethod of control. Any add-on control device's emission control efficiencymust be determined by knowing both the capture efficiency and the destructionefficiency. Capture efficiency is the amount of emissions which are deliveredto the control device divided by the total amount of emissions enteringthe system (e.g., coating line). Destruction efficiency is the amount ofemissions destroyed by the control device divided by the amount of emissionsentering that control device. The overall control efficiency of the add-oncontrol device is calculated by multiplying the capture and destructionefficiencies. The capture and destruction efficiencies in any system mustbe determined by actual testing in the system because there are many variableswhich influence the final result. This is particularly true of captureefficiency. Determining actual capture efficiency involves the constructionof a temporary or permanent enclosure around the system and determiningsuch factors as air flow rates, among other variables. Estimates for anadsorption system have been made and an overall control efficiency of 63%,with an assumed capture efficiency of 70% and a removal efficiency of 90%,might be expected. This 63% control efficiency uses an assumed captureefficiency which would not be acceptable for a source to use when determiningcompliance. Therefore, the use of a control method which lowers VOC emissionsby preventing the generation of those emissions provides the added advantageof not having to test for and determine capture and destruction efficiencies.Consequently, EPA is proposing that lubricant substitution as stipulatedby the Consent Order for Reynolds Metals-Foil Plant in Richmond, Virginia,dated December 21, 1987, represents RACT for this aluminum rolling source.Conclusion: EPA's decision to propose approval of the SIP revision regardingnon-CTG regulations for aluminum rolling mill operations is based on adetermination that this SIP revision is consistent with section 110 andpart D of the Clean Air Act.The public is invited to submit comments, to the Region III address above,on whether or not this revision should be approved.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this action will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709).The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edwin B.
