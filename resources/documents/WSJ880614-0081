LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Monsanto Co. said it has produced genetically engineered soybean plants using gene transfer techniques.    Although the company said commercial application isn't expected until the mid-1990s, it said genetic improvement of the soybean would facilitate the rapid development of new varieties with traits such as herbicide or virus resistance.    That not only could help the chemical concern sell its own herbicide, but enable it to sell its technology to, or work in conjunction with, seed companies.    A spokeswoman said the chemical company still has &quot;a great amount of work&quot; to do in the lab, but that it hopes in the next two to three years to field test soybeans with tolerance to its Roundup herbicide and resistance to insects and viruses.    &quot;It's nothing that's going to revolutionize agriculture in the near term, but it's been particularly difficult to modify the genetic material of soybeans,&quot; said William R. Young, a chemical industry analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Previously, Monsanto researchers have genetically modified crop species such as tomato plants, flax and cotton. &quot;Soybeans was a tough nut -- or bean -- to crack, and I think this portends some really good things in the 1990s,&quot; Mr. Young added.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Monsanto stock rose $1 to $85. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report, the stock was boosted as one analyst raised his opinion to a &quot;buy&quot; and another boosted his earnings estimates. </TEXT></DOC>
