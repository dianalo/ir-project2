All 25 youngsters in the Van Ness Elementary School classroomdonned similar handmade tags in honor of the secretary's visit thatmarked National School Lunch Week and World Food Week.   Yeutter and seven other top officials at the U.S. Department ofAgriculture discussed the potato in second through six-gradeclasses at Van Ness, which has been a ``partner'' of the USDA forabout six years.   ``Most people don't realize how important a food potatoes are,''Yeutter said, after distributing white potatoes to each of thestudents. ``They are the most important vegetable in the wholeworld.   ``Of course there's broccoli. The president says you shouldn'teat broccoli but don't pay attention to him,'' he said smiling.   Yeutter rhapsodized on the merits of the spud, using a lessonplan developed by John S. Niederhauser, the winner of this year'sWorld Food Prize for advancing the production and consumption ofpotatoes.   Reneya Gaston, 11, eagerly told Yeutter that water is stored inpotatoes, while two other students traded guesses of 100 pounds and125 pounds as the amount of potatoes most Americans eat per year.   Joking with teacher Maxwell, Yeutter said, ``You got a smartbunch of kids here. They don't really need a teacher.''   Bernadette Goatley, 11, presented to Yeutter a green school cap,key chain and a framed copy of the school's vision, ``on behalf ofall potato lovers here at Van Ness.''   Yeutter left the students a potted leafy green potato plant.   What did she learn in class? ``We eat a lot of potatoes over ayear. My favorite is french fries,'' said Bernadette.   After class, Yeutter and the officials put on large white apronsand served the students a lunch of barbecued chicken, macaroni andcheese, mixed vegetables, oatmeal roll, fresh fruit and pearcobbler - but no potatoes.   The National School Lunch program, established in 1946 andadministered nationally by the USDA, is a federally assisted mealprogram that provides balanced, low-cost or free lunches to about24 million children each school day at 91,500 schools.   At Van Ness, Principal Cassandra Butler said about 90 percent ofthe 280 pre-school through sixth grade youngsters receive freelunch, while a small percent pay either the reduced fee of 10 centsor the full price of 40 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
