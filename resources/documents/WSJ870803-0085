As previously reported, Standard Chartered has said that it is considering selling all or part of its holding. The eventual sale of Stanbic, South Africa's second-largest banking group, has been expected since Standard Chartered lowered its stake from 53% in 1985.    Stanbic directors last week requested the suspension, which runs until the close of business tomorrow. Stanbic said the board was &quot;aware that discussions are taking place concerning the future&quot; of Standard Chartered's holding.    South African analysts have speculated that Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd., which already holds 22.6% of Stanbic's ordinary and preferred shares and has a first option on Standard Chartered's stake, will purchase the holding. </TEXT></DOC>
