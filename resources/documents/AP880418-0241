(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Abbey Meyers knows the suffering andfrustration that accompanies rare diseases that are often neglectedby drug manufacturers.   Her three children suffer from Tourette syndrome, a disordercharacterized by involuntary muscular movements and vocal noises.   In 1979, when her oldest son was 12, he received an experimentaldrug that halted the symptoms. When it was announced thatproduction of the drug was to be halted, Meyers launched aletter-writing campaign.   In 1980, she founded the National Organization for RareDisorders, based in New Fairfield. Her efforts enabled her son andother children to continue to receive the drug.   NORD's goal is to help people suffering from the so-called``orphan diseases,'' those rare ailments that have failed toattract the millions of research dollars needed to find cures ortreatments because individually they afflict relatively few people.   An orphan disease is one that afflicts less than 200,000 people.There are 5,000 such diseases affecting an estimated 20 millionAmericans, according to NORD.   But the orphan diseases have started to attract greater interestin recent years, thanks in part to the efforts of NORD.   NORD is a clearinghouse for information on rare diseases. Italso makes referrals to rare disease support groups and works toencourage development of drugs to treat rare diseases.   The non-profit group began as an informal coalition of healthagencies and individuals. It incorporated in 1983 and opened itsoffice in 1985. It now has six full-time workers and an annualbudget of about $250,000.   ``The public told us what they wanted us to be, otherwise wewould have remained an informal group,'' says Meyers, the NORDexecutive director.   The organization has information on 1,500 of the diseases.Interested people can obtain information through the mail, or bylinking up with a computer data base run by NORD through CompuServein Columbus, Ohio.   ``People tell us their symptoms,'' Meyers says. ``But we can'thelp people unless they have a diagnosis. They must have a name fortheir diseases.''   Meyers says the rarest disease may be ``severe combined immunedeficiency,'' of which there are 27 known cases. A person afflictedwith this disease has no immunity to disease, like the Texas boywho lived in a plastic bubble.   Cystinosis is a genetic kidney disorder that affects about 70children. Those afflicted with the disease used to die before their10th birthday, but now live longer due to a new drug.   Generally, Meyers says, rarest diseases are those known asrecessive hereditary disorders. These diseases result only whenboth parents have defective genes, resulting in a one-in-fourchance that an offspring will suffer a rare ailment.   Perhaps the most widespread of the recessive disorders is cysticfibrosis, which affects 20,000 people.   NORD uses medical librarians and others who read medicaljournals and then rewrite the information on diseases in languagethat lay people can understand. It doesn't have researchers of itsown doing any work on rare disorders.   ``We do everything we can in ways that cost the least,'' Meyerssays.   The organization also is actively involved in helping theFederal Drug Administration and pharmaceutical companies worktogether to develop drugs for rare diseases. That effort got aboost with the 1983 passage of the Orphan Drug Act, which providestax incentives to companies that develop drugs for orphan diseases.The law also provided $4 million this year for research grants.   The drug companies previously ignored orphan diseases becauseit's expensive to develop new drugs and because the market wasn'tlarge enough to produce big profits. It can cost up to $80 millionto develop a new drug, according to NORD.   ``If there's a problem that crops up along the way, we'll act asan intermediary,'' Meyers says.   To date, the FAA has approved 183 orphan drug programs and 23have resulted in medications ready for the market. The drawback tothe program is that these drugs are generally expensive. Forinstance, it costs about $10,000 a year to supply a child sufferingfrom dwarfism with a growth hormone.   The growth hormone price has remained high even though it hasbecome more popular than imagined. The drug is apparently beingused by some athletes to build muscles, Meyers says. The drug hasfound a black market because it can't be detected like steroids,which are illegal in sports competitions.   NORD also is planning to fund its own clinical research programlater this year. The organization has raised $80,000 to get itseffort moving and Meyers says she's looking to get ``good researchgoing in areas where no other research is going.''   ``We've got to get ideas out of test tubes and into patientclinical research,'' she says.</TEXT><TEXT>   Eds: The mailing address for the National Organization for RareDisorders is P.O.
