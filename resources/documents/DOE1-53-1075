Ionization charge measuredin each of the four media as a function of depth and depth-dose curvescalculated by Monte Carlo simulation show that the three solids are equivalentto each other and to water under full scattering conditions. Photon energyspectra generated from the Monte Carlo simulation show little variationfor the different media. Mass energy absorption coefficients and exposure-to-doseconversion factors were calculated as a function of depth for these spectra.Measured tissue attenuation factors are in excellent agreement with Meisberger'sselected values. The radial dose function, which describes the changein dose with distance in phantom exclusive of the inverse square law,was calculated from the tissue attenuation factor and found to be insignificant disagreement with Dale's Monte Carlo values. The reason forthis discrepancy is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
