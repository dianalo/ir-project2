New Vision said the dead were among 276 youths rounded up on July10 from villages around Kumi, about 150 miles northeast of Kampalaand a region believed to be a major hideout for Uganda People's Armyrebels.   New Vision said government soldiers locked the youths in oldtrain coaches where they were kept for three days, and more than 50of them died of suffocation.   The English-language daily said the government planned to send amilitary intelligence team to Kumi to investigate the report. It didnot say why youths were targeted in the roundup.   The London-based Amnesty International has accused Uganda'sNational Resistance Army of human rights violations including rape,torture, murder and illegal detention of civilians and says suchincidents appear to be on the increase.   But the group has credited President Yoweri Museveni withbringing an ``immediate end to the gross human rights violationsinflicted by previous governments.''   Museveni came to power in 1986 after a five-year guerrilla warand has been fighting several rebel groups opposed to his governmentin northern and eastern Uganda.   In the northern Uganda town of Gulu, rebels Thursday abducted 40people, killed one, robbed police and military personnel of theirweapons, and stole drugs from the hospital, New Vision reported.   Two nurses were among the captives who were made to carry therebels' loot, said the newspaper.   The rebels were believed to be members of the Holy SpiritMovement, which has been harrassing and torturing civilians andlooting the area around Gulu since the beginning of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
