The award provides funds to accelerate production on an earlier Air Force order for 10 Titan 4 vehicles and also covers the purchase of 13 more under an Air Force program that envisions the new type of expendable vehicles as a complement to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shuttle launches.    The Air Force has only four of the older Titan 34D models left after two successful launches last fall broke a long dry spell in U.S. space activities. The order for the first 10 Titan 4s was effectively suspended in April 1986 after Titan 34D failures closely followed the Challenger shuttle disaster.    &quot;We're looking for a robust launch capability and assured access to space,&quot; an Air Force spokesman said.    The huge order also covers the construction of a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that's larger than the one used to lift the older Titans. The Titan 4 will be able to lift a 10,000-pound payload into geostationary orbit, meaning the payload remains in a fixed location relative to the earth's surface. The Air Force said that's equal to, or better than, the shuttle's lifting capacity and 2 1/2 times more than the Titan 34Ds. The military payloads are typically communications or reconnaissance satellites.    Martin Marietta, an aerospace and data company based in Bethesda, Md., is the sole producer of both Titan vehicles. The Titan 4s will be constructed at its Denver plant. A Martin Marietta statement said the first Titan 4 launches are scheduled for late 1988. In time, the new vehicles will be delivered at a rate that would enable Vandenberg to make six launches a year, the company said.    In other contract awards yesterday, Negretti Aviation won an $18.9 million Navy job for gas masks for helicopter crews.    International Business Machines Corp. was issued a $17.6 million Navy contract for SH-60B helicopter equipment.    Amoco Oil Co. received a $16.1 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for jet fuel.    Information Systems andamp; Networks Corp. got a $12.4 million Navy contract for intrusion-detection systems. </TEXT></DOC>
