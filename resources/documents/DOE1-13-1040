Thegoal of this work was to test and evaluate the effectivity of computedtomography for neurotraumatology. Using 565 patients, who were acutelyor at one time suffering from a cranium-brain trauma, the high validityof computed tomography for these injuries was proven. The following areasin question were studied with respect to the value of computed tomographyin comparison to them: angiography, X-ray diagnostic, echoencephalography,brain scintigraphy, electroencephalography and neurological-psychopathologicalfindings from cranium-brain trauma. Statement possibilities and difficultiesof computed tomography are discussed in the cases of the following neurotraumatologicaldiseases: extracranial hematomas; acute cranium-brain traumas; traumaticarachnoidal bleeding; diffuse brain edema; transtentorial herniationand brain contusions. At the end the diagnostic and therapeutic proceduresin the case of cranium-brain trauma are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
