It was established that: -the particulatetraps hardly have an effect on emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbonsand nitrogen oxides, -the traps reduce the amount of emitted particulatematter to a relatively high extent, -the catalyst reduces emissions ofcarbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, -the catalyst does not have an appreciableinfluence on total nitrogen emission but increases the fraction of nitrogendioxide, -the catalyst reduces the amount of emitted particulate matter.(O.S.).</TEXT></DOC>
