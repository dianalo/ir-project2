The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had closed above the 2100 level Wednesday for the first time in more than a month, dropped 8.36 to 2092.28.    Broader market measures followed the Dow Jones industrials to lower levels. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.18 to 268.13, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.53 to 151.60. There were 766 issues declining in price on the Big Board, while 665 advanced.    Trading activity was moderate, but traders said many participants adopted a more cautious stance toward the market as they waited to see if its latest advance could be sustained. Big Board trading amounted to 161.2 million shares, down from 177.2 million the day before.    After posting solid gains Wednesday on news that the July trade deficit narrowed sharply to $9.53 billion from $13.22 billion in June, the market spent most of the session drifting near the previous day's closing levels.    Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage tipped the balance to the minus side, traders said. The round of programs, involving the purchase of index futures and the sale of the underlying stocks, took place as the market prepared for the year's third &quot;triple witching hour&quot; -- the day when index futures and options expire along with options on individual stocks.    With stocks showing little overall sense of direction, the market's attention shifted to the takeover front amid news of a major divestiture at Zayre, a buy-out proposal at Hospital Corp. of America and a sweetened bid for Macmillan from Britain's Maxwell Communication.    Those developments, coming on the heels of several other major moves in recent days, sent some investors searching for other potential takeover targets. As a result, rumors regarding potential deals that have surfaced periodically during the past several months once again came to the forefront.    The focus on takeover issues provided market players with a chance to &quot;keep the juices flowing without going to sleep,&quot; said Edward P. Nicoski, a market analyst at Piper Jaffray andamp; Hopwood, Minneapolis.    Money managers seeking to invest in stocks are being frustrated by the market's &quot;random rallies and reactions,&quot; which have prevented any clear trends from emerging, Mr. Nicoski said. &quot;There's been no consistent pattern that has lasted more than several months that portfolio managers have been able to use to get on the bandwagon.&quot;    Robert Walsh, a money manager at Jenswold King andamp; Associates, Houston, said the revival of interest in takeover stocks also indicates that the market's confidence remains low, in spite of the trade news and other reports that show economic growth slowing. &quot;People who are willing to step into the marketplace are really looking for an extra special premium,&quot; he said.    Mr. Walsh said his firm is maintaining a 15% to 18% cash level in its portfolios and would need to see a downturn in the market, along with further declines in interest rates and strength in the dollar, before making any significant change in that position. &quot;We don't think it's necessary to bet all the money at this time,&quot; he said.    While Mr. Walsh expressed confidence that the market would conclude the third quarter &quot;on an up note,&quot; Mr. Nicoski cautioned that such factors as the current level of interest rates and the broad market's inability to keep pace with the major averages suggest the market is likely to prove unable to surpass its highs for the year. &quot;There's really not enough evidence -- at least not yet -- to show that there's a major move in the offing,&quot; he said.    Zayre, which agreed to sell its discount store division, gained 2 to 25 in Big Board composite trading of 9.7 million shares. The agreement calls for Ames Department Stores to acquire the division for $800 million in cash, notes and preferred stock. Speculation about the sale had been rampant during the past few months and reemerged Wednesday. Ames dropped 7/8 to 16 3/8.    Hospital Corp. jumped 6 5/8 to 43 3/4 on volume of 3.3 million shares in response to news that a management group will propose a leveraged buy-out of the company at about $47 a share, or about $3.33 billion.    Another health care provider, American Medical International, rose 3/4 to 16 5/8 and was the Big Board's most active issue with volume of 9.8 million shares. The company said it may retire as much as $300 million of debt and buy back as much as $150 million of stock. Elsewhere in the sector, National Medical Enterprises gained 1 1/4 to 21 5/8, Humana climbed 5/8 to 26 1/2, and Manor Care went up 5/8 to 12 1/2.    Macmillan advanced 2 to 86 1/2, just below the price of Maxwell Communication's sweetened takeover offer. The British company would now pay $86.80 a share plus the company's 20-cent quarterly dividend due in October, topping the $85-a-share buy-out proposal by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., which the company has accepted. Maxwell had offered $80 a share.    Several other stocks benefited from the revival of takeover speculation. B.F. Goodrich jumped 1 5/8 to 58 1/8, American Cyanamid advanced 1/2 to 48 3/4, Mead added 1/4 to 44 1/2, and West Point-Pepperell climbed 3/4 to 36 1/8.    In addition, PaineWebber Group rose 1 1/4 to 18 1/4 amid rumors of a possible $22-a-share takeover offer. One arbitrager told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report there was talk that either the brokerage firm would go private with the assistance of Japan's Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance, which has an 18% voting interest, or Yasuda would buy PaineWebber outright. The firm said there was no basis for the rumors.    Cray Research plunged 4 5/8 to 75 1/2. Cowen andamp; Co. cut its estimate of Cray's 1989 earnings. The company said it isn't yet ready to comment on the outlook for next year, but added that it expects to make some preliminary projections when it reports third-quarter earnings in October.    Gulf andamp; Western went down 1 3/4 to 41. Merrill Lynch lowered its investment rating and its 1989 and 1990 earnings estimates to reflect expectations that an absence of hit movies from the company's Paramount Pictures unit would hurt videocassette sales.    Royal Dutch Petroleum rose 1 1/2 to 109 3/4, and Shell Transport andamp; Trading advanced 1 1/4 to 69 1/8. The companies, partners in the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, both proposed 2-for-1 stock splits and raised their interim dividends.    The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.65 to 297.70. Volume totaled 7,780,000 shares, down from 10,530,000 Wednesday. There were 251 issues advancing, 283 declining and 293 unchanged.    ATandamp;E, a small, thinly traded company trying to develop a telephone-to-wristwatch communications system, jumped 2 1/8 to 9 7/8 a share. The company said it knew of no reason for the activity but disclosed that it is seeking $100 million in private financing, expected to close by November. Its stock traded as high as $31.875 a share last year, before the October crash. </TEXT></DOC>
