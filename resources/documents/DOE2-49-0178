Itis estimated to contribute 15-20% to the global carbon dioxide (CO/sub2/) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. Indirectly the emissionsof carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (VOC), and nitrogen oxides (NO/subx/) are important, the former two via their influence on the atmosphericlifetime of methane, the latter as ozone precursor. Estimates of futureemissions of CO and VOC have been made based on scenarios for car ownershipand technological development. Major uncertainties are caused by therather unpredictable development of private car ownership in highly populatedthird world countries. CO/sub 2/ can be limited by increasing fuel efficiency,a fuel switch or limitation of car ownership and car use. CO, VOC andNO/sub x/ can also be abated by additional technical measures. The roleof the traffic sector with respect to global nitrous oxide (N/sub 2/O)-and NO/sub x/-emissions is yet insufficiently known. 5 figs., 9 refs.,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
