Net at St. Louis-based General Dynamics tumbled to $57million, or $1.37 a share, from $124 million, or $2.97 ashare, the year before. The year-ago figure, however,includes a $61.5 million benefit from settlement of anantitrust lawsuit with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.Without that favorable adjustment, General Dynamics wouldhave earned $63 million, or $1.49 a share, in the firstperiod of 1990. Sales slipped to $2.3 billion from $2.5billion.</LP><TEXT>   Chairman William Anders said he was pleased with thecompany's latest results, despite a 9.5% decline in operatingearnings. Wall Street apparently was pleased, too, as GeneralDynamics's shares rose $1.625 to close at $35 in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading.   Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Northrop said thatdiscounting the 1990 sale of its headquarters complex, whichresulted in a $67.1 million windfall, operating profitclimbed 36% during the latest three months to $39.3 million,or 84 cents a share, from $28.9 million, or 62 cents a share.   Including the building's sale, last year's net was $96million, or $2.04 a share. Sales at the aerospace companyeased to $1.25 billion from $1.28 billion.   &quot;Northrop is definitely in a recovery mode,&quot; said StevenBinder, of Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;They've put some of theirrisky programs behind them. . . .and they've cut costs, too.&quot;Yesterday, Northrop closed in composite trading on the BigBoard at $28.875, up 87.5 cents.   Northrop said its overall operating margin in the firstquarter rose 47% to $78.5 million, or 6.3% of sales. Theuptick reflected, in part, the end of investments required onthe Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF, project. ANorthrop-led team of contractors is competing to build theATF, the Air Force's next-generation jet fighter, against ateam led by Lockheed Corp. A winner in the $60 billion-pluscontest is expected to be announced by April 30.   For its part, General Dynamics has cut expenses, too.Analysts said the 5.1% profit margin recorded by thecompany's Fort Worth, Texas, jet-fighter operation was muchbetter than anticipated -- especially after a disastrousfourth quarter in which it registered a $274 million pretaxincrease in reserves on the now-canceled A-12 attack-planeprogram. Margins at General Dynamics's tank and submarinefactories were solid, too.   Since taking the top post at General Dynamics in January,Mr. Anders has shaken up the managerial ranks, preaching theneed for tighter cost controls. He has revamped employeecompensation to hold workers, blue-collar and white-collar,more accountable for their performances. &quot;Our earnings,&quot; hesaid yesterday, &quot;are right in line with our plan.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
