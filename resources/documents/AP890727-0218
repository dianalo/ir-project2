By a vote of 261-162, the House adopted a bill changed in thefinal minutes by an odd coalition of Republicans, angered by thecut of $502 million from the $1.1 billion the administration hadrequested for the MX missile, and liberal Democrats, opposed to theplanned Midgetman missile.   The bill also includes money for the Navy's F-14D jet fighterand the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff assaulttransport _ two programs Bush planned to scrap.   ``We got a Michael Dukakis defense bill,'' Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, saidshortly after the vote. ``Mike won the election. No Midgetman. Norail MX. ... Big cuts in SDI, and slow up the B-2 bomber.''   Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, suffered aresounding defeat at the hands of Bush in the 1988 presidentialelection.   But according to Aspin, the Democratic-controlled House carriedout the losing candidate's campaign pledges in crafting theirversion of the defense bill.   ``We have pretty well shredded George Bush's strategicprograms,'' Aspin said.   The Senate, on the other hand, narrowly turned back an amendmentthat could have opened the door to deep cuts in the Star Warsbudget. The vote was 50-47 to table, and thus set aside, theamendment.   The measure sponsored by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., wouldhave frozen $3.62 billion of the Bush administration's request forStar Wars, adding only enough to cover 3.2 percent inflation.   The freeze would not have affected the the $2.6 billionearmarked for the Department of Energy in Bush's $4.9 billionproposal for Star Wars in the new fiscal year.   Vice President Dan Quayle hurried to the Capitol and presidedduring the vote in case he was needed to break a tie.   In the House, the final cut in the Bush budget was the $100million the administration requested for the Midgetman.   ``A cute thing happened after we voted to support the amendment(for MX and Midgetman), a measure to gut the MX rail-garrison,''said Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking GOP member on theHouse Armed Services Committee, in introducing a motion to recommitthe defense bill to committee.   ``That's the game, OK. Take out $500 million for rail-garrison,take out Midgetman,'' he said.   Aspin in debate urged members not to approve a ``motion ofspite.'' But by a standing vote of 176-90 the House approved therevision eliminating all the money for the single-warhead Midgetmanmissile.   Later, Aspin said he spoke to Cheney who had urged Dickinson notto introduce the motion to recommit.   Democrats generally support Midgetman, designed to move aroundon heavy trucks, as a way to force the two superpowers to movetoward single-warhead missiles which would present less temptingtargets in a crisis than the 10-warhead MX and similar Sovietmissiles.   House and Senate conferees will meet after the August recess tocraft a final defense bill, which also includes $10 billion for theDepartment of Energy for a $305 billion package.   The Senate is expected to complete its version of a militaryauthorization bill next week. All money authorized still must beprovided in separate appropriations bills.   The House's military spending blueprint suspends production ofthe B-2 stealth bomber, priced at about $530 million a copy, untilthe Pentagon scales back its $70 billion, 132-plane program.   The bill also requires the administration to show the B-2 is aproven plane before production resumes.   Bush and Cheney had lobbied hard for the costly aircraft. In thedays before House action on the authorization bill, theadministration also pleaded its case for Star Wars.   But the House slashed $1.8 billion from the president's requestof $4.9 billion for Star Wars, officially known as the StrategicDefense Initiative, earmarking the savings for conventionalweapons, cleanup of nuclear defense facilities and military druginterdiction.   Bowing to widespread political support for the programs, Rep.William Dickinson, R-Ala., pulled two measures to the House defensebill that would have eliminated money that was authorized by theHouse Armed Services Committee and scuttle the F-14D and the V-22.   ``There was no need to ask the guys to walk the plank out ofsupport of the administration,'' Dickinson said of his decision towithdraw the amendment to eliminate the Marine Corps' V-22, thetilt-rotor assault transport that takes off like a helicopter butcan fly like a plane.   The aircraft had the strong support of members from Pennsylvaniaand Texas, where the Osprey is built, as well as former Marines inCongress.   The Alabama Republican said his GOP colleagues from New Yorkpressed him to withdraw the F-14D amendment and an unofficial countmade the outcome obvious. When he announced the withdrawal, therewas scattered applause on the House floor.   The eventual fate of the F-14D will not be decided until theHouse and Senate meet in conference on their versions of thedefense bill.   Earlier this month, the Senate Armed Services Committee acceptedthe Bush administration's proposal to eliminate the program.   The House Armed Services Committee, however, rejected theadministration's plan to halt production of new F-14Ds, andauthorized $1 billion for the program in its military blueprint forthe fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in slashing $10 billion from thedefense budget, had proposed eliminated the program. He contendedother jet fighters would suffice.   Earlier in the day, the House approved a non-binding resolutioncalling on Bush to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on aban of production of plutonium and enriched uranium, materials usedin nuclear weapons.   The House approved the amendment 284-138. The United Statescurrently has no operating nuclear enrichment production plantswhile the Soviets have between 12 and 14.   In other action the House:   _Approved an amendment limiting total outlays for defense infiscal 1990 to $299.2 billion.   _Approved an amendment sponsored by Rep. Bill Richardson,D-N.M., prohibiting the Los Alamos National Laboratory from burningradioactive wastes until New Mexico issues regulations on suchincineration.   _Adopted a non-binding resolution urging Bush to press theSoviets on dismantling their ground-based, anti-satellite weaponsand to negotiate a treay with the Soviets on imposing strictlimitations on ASAT weapons.   _Voted to prohibit use of fiscal 1990 funds for Army productionof binary chemical weapons.   _Extended through fiscal 1993 the goal of having 5 percent ofPentagon contracts awared to small and disadvantaged businesses.   _Adopted a non-binding resolution urging Bush to step upnegotations with the Soviets on an agreement to stop production andstockpiling of lethal chemical weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
