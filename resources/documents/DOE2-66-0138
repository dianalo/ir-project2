The deep Anadarko basin has been one ofthe areas of heavy activity, and is thought to contain a significantportion of the remaining unproven deep gas resource in the lower-48 states.A detailed analysis of gas production and proven reserves in the deepbasin has established the characteristics and historical importance ofeach of the major plays and productive formations. The analysis shouldprove to be a valuable tool in estimating the undiscovered gas potentialof the deep basin. Through 1985, there were 908 completions in the deepAnadarko basin. These completions accounted for 6.10 tcf of proven ultimaterecovery, an average of 6.72 bcf per completion. In general, there isone completion per well and one well per section. Thus, ultimate recoveryper completion represents ultimate recovery per section. The Hunton Grouphas the highest mean ultimate recovery at 15.3 bcf, followed by the ArbuckleGroup at 10.1 bcf. In an attempt to evaluate existing resource appraisalsof the deep basin, the areal distribution of production by formationwas determined for the mature, shallow part of the basin. Over 20,000completions were included in this analysis, demonstrating a significantdatabase application. By using this distribution as a guide, along withcertain other constraints, a range of 15-47 tcf of undiscovered potentialwas estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
