A new law forces parents to report the name and tax identification number of baby sitters to get a tax break through employer dependent-care plans. &quot;It's a big mistake,&quot; says a Times Mirror Corp. official, who frets that use of such plans will slow. One reason: Some employees use illegal aliens and won't turn them in. Others use relatives or friends who don't report their income.    &quot;I think you'd give up your own tax break before you'd saddle your parents with a tax,&quot; says a Ryder System Inc. official, who foresees a possible exodus from the program. Some employees have dropped out of Great Western Financial Corp.'s plan saying they won't report their baby sitters.    A Hewitt Associates survey shows 21% of 800 companies offer such plans but only 4% of employees use them.    CHILD-CARE CONSULTANTS proliferate as more firms offer aid for parents.    Resources for Child Care Management of Berkeley Heights, N.J., is helping Johnson andamp; Johnson design an onsite day-care center and planning &quot;drop in care&quot; for shoppers and employees of Wegman's supermarket chain. It also has advised Colgate-Palmolive and Campbell's Soup Co. Corporate Child Care of Nashville has aided 31 clients and the list is growing. It surveyed Holiday Corp.'s employee needs and set up a plan for Alcoa workers' sick kids.    Clients of Work/Family Directions of Watertown, Mass., one of the biggest in the field, include IBM, American Express and Digital Equipment. Workplace Options Inc. recommends both business and child development skills, because those with just a business base &quot;don't know what's good&quot; for a baby.    PHASE TWO: A new era in corporate work and family programs emerges.    Family policies are increasing and new types of companies are getting involved, say a group of Bank Street College researchers led by Ellen Galinsky. These new companies aren't pioneers but followers. An increasingly female work force and future labor shortages add pressure for change.    &quot;Phase One&quot; firms who pioneered work and family policies are moving to a &quot;holistic view&quot; and away from a &quot;Band-Aid approach.&quot; The best of them see easing strains as a business issue. Programs have chief-executive or senior-manager support, and policies are more centralized; some firms appoint directors of work and family programs. Many attack the corporate culture to make it more &quot;family friendly.&quot;    But the gap widens between the have and have-not companies, with few workplace supports overall to help parents balance both jobs.    SENATOR CLEAVER? Only 24% of 41 U.S. congressmen with children under 14 have wives who work outside the home, says a survey by Legal Times. One of the stay-at-homes is Vice President-elect Quayle's wife. The Times reports that an &quot;au pair&quot; was hired to care for the children while Mrs. Quayle campaigned, but the helper didn't work out and the senator's parents took over.    KID BUSINESS: Child care, a $15.3 billion business, is expected to grow at an annual rate of 21% until 1995, when it will be a $48 billion market. So says a study for Scholastic Inc., the educational publisher. Annual fees average up to $3,172, yet the supply meets just 50% of demand.    WOMEN ELECTED to public office are less likely than men to have young children, according to a report on the American woman by the Women's Research and Education Institute, Washington. The ages of her kids are a big factor in a woman's decision to run for office. She's typically married, with children over age 12.    LEGAL CARE: Arnold andamp; Porter, Washington's biggest law firm, plans to soon open an emergency day-care center for its 300 lawyers. The center will help when regular sitters are ill. It also will be open snow days and school holidays, plus weekends. The move is part of a growing trend among law firms to offer day-care aid.    MISSISSIPPI COMPUTERS link job seekers with quality day-care services.    In the first such program in the nation, Mississippi's employment security commission offers one-stop information on licensed child-care facilities in the state. The project was funded by the Labor Department as a model for other states. Officials say the program helps relieve child-care pressures on parents looking for work.    The state's 76 employment offices offer computer printouts of licensed day-care centers for any area of the state. Note is taken of centers under investigation. Officials plan next to provide information about day care to employers to pass along to employees. Also, the governor's office plans to make consultants available to employers to help develop day-care services.    THE CHECKOFF: Adolph Coors Co. ended its pilot program to provide care for employees' sick children, because only one person used the service in six months. . . . The number of women having babies and returning to work, according to Personnel Journal, rose to 52% of working women in 1987 from 32% in 1977.    (Revised WSJ Nov. 16, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
