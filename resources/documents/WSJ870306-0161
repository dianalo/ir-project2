The unsettled debt market and proposed Federal Reserve Board rules on capital have put banks between a rock and hard place. The Fed, as part of a campaign to boost the capital levels of major banks, has proposed new regulations dealing with the types of securities that regulators would count as primary capital.    The regulations would make one of banks' popular capital-raising tools unattractive to investors. The Fed has proposed some substitutes, but a lot of Wall Street investment bankers think those couldn't be sold either. A large class of buyers of bank debt might even be barred from holding some of the substitute securities.    As revised by the proposed rules, one of banks' most popular securities, primary capital notes, might run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service.    As a result, some banks are rushing to market the popular notes, whose redemption involves issuing stock, before the comment period on the regulations ends in mid-May. During the comment period, banks can be sure the rules won't be instituted.    Bankers Trust Co. yesterday offered $200 million of the notes, and investment bankers say many of their clients are considering similar offerings.    These banks face an unattractive market. A number of factors have increased the amount by which rates on bank debt exceed those on Treasury securities, boosting the spreads by a quarter of a percentage point or more in recent weeks. To a bank, that is a big jump. Helping widen those spreads are a pending surplus of securities, the collapse of the European market for perpetual floating-rate notes and investors' worries about bank exposure to Third World debt.    Citicorp plans to wait out the poor market. &quot;We could not issue today on what I would regard as any kind of reasonable terms,&quot; says Citicorp's chief financial officer, Donald Howard. Citicorp, which issued $500 million of perpetual floating-rate notes before that European market collapsed, doesn't need more capital right now, Mr. Howard said.    Some banks are willing to pay the higher rate on existing securities because they aren't sure they could sell the substitutes the Fed is proposing. Robert A. Baer Jr., a managing director of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., calls it &quot;a classic case of regulators trying to do their job and the market trying to do its job&quot; and ending up at cross purposes.    One substitute, for instance, runs up against insurance industry rules on what types of securities insurers can buy. Insurance companies generally are among the biggest buyers of banks' securities.    Banks' debt securities would have to look a good deal like equity to count as primary capital under the proposed Fed rules. On primary capital notes, for instance, banks would have to reduce interest payments if they stopped paying stock dividends. &quot;Even with a strong bank,&quot; says Alan Pabst, treasurer of Wells Fargo Bank, that provision would be &quot;a negative in the market.&quot;    Debt securities that look like equity also have had trouble passing Internal Revenue Service muster. &quot;If they make the securities less like debt and more like preferred stock,&quot; Mr. Pabst says, &quot;it's not clear the IRS would allow deductibility&quot; of interest payments by investors.    Some bankers, Citicorp's Mr. Howard among them, are willing to wait out the current unattractive market because they believe the Fed will rework its proposals to take marketing problems into consideration. A few years ago, Citicorp and the Fed spent six months hammering out one form of capital note, Mr. Howard recalls, and ended up with something that satisfied both parties. &quot;I believe we will end up there&quot; with the new proposals as well, he says.    Nonetheless, banks face a good deal of uncertainty surrounding financing. Not only don't they know what kinds of securities they'll be able to issue, they don't even know how much capital they'll be required to carry. The Fed's proposed regulations are only a small part of a broader campaign to tailor each bank's capital requirements to the risks it's taking.    So most banks are looking to raise what capital they can when they can. &quot;We thought it behooved us to do it sooner,&quot; says Denis O'Leary, director of finance at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, which made a $150 million offering last month, shortly after the proposals were announced. &quot;Everyone senses there's going to be a lot of supply.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
