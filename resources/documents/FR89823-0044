The commentperiod for this notice was 60 days. This comment period was extended foran additional 60 days (53 FR 38759 dated October 3, 1988).The proposed fee schedule and policy were based on categories of use withindividual fees to be determined by population, number of licensed transmitterfrequencies, or the nature of the use. The proposal also called for annualadjustments of the scheduled fees based upon the Consumer Price Index_Urban(CPI-U) and provided for a phase-in of fee increases. The proposal waspublished simultaneously with the proposals of five other Regions, whohad coordinated their proposals to achieve Service-wide consistency wherepossible.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Public Comment</ITAG>The Intermountain Region received 110 written responses to the proposal.The number and percentage of comments by respondents were:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,7,7</C> <H1>Use categories</H1><H1>No. of comments</H1><H1>Percent</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Amateur radio<D>7</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Broadcast translator<D>14</D><D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mobile radio; commercial communications<D>25</D><D>23</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mobile radio; internal communications<D>13</D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Common carrier microwave relay<D>4</D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Industrial microwave<D>10</D><D>9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Natural resource and environmental monitoring<D>3</D><D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Radio broadcast<D>12</D><D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Television broadcast<D>18</D><D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other<D>4</D><D>4</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>110</D><D>100</D></ITAG>All of the comments received have been reviewed and given considerationin reaching the final decision. A summary of the major comments receivedand the Forest Service response by topic follows. It should be noted thatthe Intermountain Region has coordinated its review and response to thecomments with the other Regions in order to achieve as much consistencyService-wide as possible.The Forest Service has made adjustments in some of the communications sitecategories after review of comments and additional information which wassubmitted by the respondents. The revised fee schedule is responsive toindustry and other concerns and is fully supported by the market data.1. <T3>Fee levels.</T3> A number of respondents felt that the proposed feesare extreme and unreasonable. Many individuals and small businesses indicatedthat the proposed fees would be too great a burden for them and that theywould have to abandon their sites if the schedule is implemented. Somesuggested a re-evaluation and reduction in the proposed fees. Others recommendedlower fee increases and a longer phase-in.A few respondents said that the proposed fee rates were too low and thusamount to public subsidies. Several suggested alternative methods for determiningfees, some of which would return many times the proposed rates to the FederalGovernment. Among alternatives proposed were: to adopt a fee policy basedon site rental income (assess a percentage of gross rental income derivedfrom the site); to consider site value in light of the alternative costof constructing competitive towers on private lands; to base fee as a percentageof the user's investment in improvements and equipment; to use per capitaincome multipliers to adjust for differences between geographical areas;and to use private management companies, with no vested interest in thesite, to establish individual fees.After analysis of these comments, the Intermountain Region has made thefollowing changes in the proposed communications use fee schedule:a. To be consistent with other Regions, the fees for cable and subscriptiontelevision will be based upon numbers of subscribers. In most situationsthis method reduces the fees charged to companies whose service is to smallpopulations and offers more stratification of fees for the mid-size companies.In the proposed schedule, fees were based on the census population withinthe franchise or service area. The change allows the fee to be based onactual use.b. The same fee structure is adopted for Mobile Radio: Commercial Communicationsand Mobile Radio: Internal Communications. There will be a $700 fee forthe first transmitting frequency plus a $200 fee for each additional transmittingfrequency. This will result in a reduction of fees for smaller operations,but will result in a slight increase for some large operations.There were few responses with regard to the proposed fees in the followinguse categories; Amateur Radio, Cellular Telephone, Common Carrier MicrowaveRelay, Industrial Microwave, Personal/Private ``Receive Only'', NaturalResource and Environmental Monitoring, and Passive Reflector. The feesas proposed in the above categories will remain the same.2. <T3>Market Survey. </T3>A number of respondents felt that the market surveyused to develop the proposed fee schedule was inadequate. Some indicatedthat the market survey and resulting fees did not give credit for enhancingpublic lands, used ability-to-pay rather than fair market value to determinethe fees, and others felt that the survey should have included all privateland leases including donated (no charge) sites, used insufficient marketdata, and did not correlate fees with investment values and site improvementcosts. Less than 7 percent of the respondents provided data supportingtheir position.The Intermountain Region coordinated with the other Forest Service Regionsin reviewing and re-analyzing the market data utilized in compiling theproposed fees. No major discrepancies were found in the market data compiledby the Forest Service. The data was found to be adequate for fee determination.For the purposes of determining fair market value, we examined availablemarket leases to see if the expense of developing facilities, access, andpower was a factor influencing private lease rates. We found no useablecorrelation. The private sector leases used to establish fair market valuefees do not clearly discount the site rental because of the developmentcost incurred by the lessee.3. <T3>Fee Exemption/Waivers</T3>. Under the proposed policy, exemptions fromfees and fee waivers would remain a decision of the authorized officer(36 CFR 251.57(b)). A number of respondents objected to the Forest Servicepolicy of charging fees for communications uses on National Forest Systemland. Others felt that fees should be waived for any use that providesa public benefit, whether that use is of a commercial nature or not. Mostrespondents on this issue found the current fee waiver policy unclear,vague, and subject to inconsistent application. They requested a clear,consistent statement of a National fee waiver policy for specific categoriesof use. Some respondents felt that government and public agencies, as wellas certain other users (utilities, public broadcasters etc.) should beexempt from fees as a matter of national policy.We agree that there should be national fee waivers established for specificcategories of use or type of holder when the entire class of use or holdermeets the rental fee waiver criteria. Therefore, national direction willbe issued concerning fee waivers for specific categories of use and typeof holder. The direction, which follows, is intended to clarify the intentof the waiver policy; it does not contain any substantive changes in currentpolicy.a. <T3>Fee exemption. </T3>Exemptions are determinations that certain classesof users will not be required to pay an annual rental fee. Most such exemptionsare statutory, i.e., they derive from specific fee exemption language inPublic Law, and are not subject to the discretion of the authorized officer.However, holders may be assessed an amount sufficient to reimburse thecost of administering the use. Holders exempt from fees include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Federal agencies;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Facilities established by Rural Electrification Administration financing;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Public telecommunication systems identified and licensed as suchby the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for educational, cultural,instructional, and institutional purposes and as described in the CommunicationsAct of 1934, and the Federal Communications Regulations granting waiverof license fees; i.e., non-commercial educational broadcast stations asdefined in part 15 CFR 2301-Public Telecommunications Facilities Program,Subpart A-Definitions, Program Purposes, and Special consideration.</ITAG>b. <T3>Fee Waiver</T3>. Waivers are discounts or reductions from payment ofthe full annual rental fee, by provision of law and regulation, and atthe discretion of the authorized officer. The Forest officer delegatedthe authority to issue the permit and establish the fee is also the officerauthorized to determine if a holder qualifies for a fee waiver. Fee waiversmay be full or partial, and must be equitable and in the public interest.(36 CFR 251.57(b)).(1) <T3>State and Local Government. </T3>The authorized officer shall waivefees in full for telecommunications facilities and systems owned and operatedby a State or local government agency or instrumentality thereof, when:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The state or local government agencies or instrumentalities thereofdo not charge the Forest Service for similar services;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The use is not installed, maintained, or otherwise financed by meansof customer charges, which include but are not limited to subscriptionfees, membership fees or dues, or special tax assessments, and;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The use furthers the public health, safety or welfare, or is otherwiseto the benefit of the general public or the programs of the Secretary ofAgriculture.</ITAG>(2) <T3>Other Holders. </T3>Waivers for other holders will be considered bythe authorized officer on a case-by-case basis. If granted, fees for otherholders will not be waived below $75, which represents the cost to theForest Service for administration of the authorization. This rate is, however,subject to revision on the basis of change in administrative costs.There were also a number of responses, as well as comments sent to theChief of the Forest Service on the proposals by all Regions, which requesteda review of the Forest Service's rental fee waiver policy for radio broadcast(commercial), television broadcast (commercial), and associated broadcasttranslators. The respondents felt that a partial or full waiver shouldbe granted based on the public service requirements of the CommunicationsAct of 1934 and the provisions of the Federal Land Policy and ManagementAct of 1976.As a result of these requests, the Forest Service is reviewing the Nationalrental fee waiver policy for these categories of use. As a part of thereview, the Forest Service is working with the Radio and Television Broadcastersto review the type and amount of public service provided.Rental fees for these categories of use will remain at current levels untilthe review is completed and a final fee is established in the schedule.We anticipate fees for these uses will be established prior to January1, 1990. All authorization holders and others expressing an interest inthe fee schedules will be notified when the final fees are established.4. <T3>Categories of Use. </T3>In the proposal, fees were based on categoriesof communications uses of National Forest System land. Each category wasdefined in the fee schedule to assure proper classification.A number of respondents, including those for other Region's felt that thecategories of uses were too narrowly defined. Various respondents urgedseparation of uses such as: (1) Specialized mobile radios from other uses;(2) commercial communication systems used for profit from those used forpublic services, and; (3) Cable TV enterprises serving major populationcenters from those serving sparsely populated rural areas.After considering all comments, the categories of ``Commercial Communicator''and ``Internal Two-Way Radio Repeater'' were changed to ``Mobile Radio:Commercial Communications'' and ``Mobile Radio: Internal Communications.In addition, definitions for these categories were modified for clarificationat the request of industry respondents. The other categories are adoptedas proposed.5. <T3>Definitions. </T3>Several respondents found certain definitions andterms inadequate or confusing. Industry suggested definitions and termsthat more clearly define commercial communications and internal radio communicationuses.In coordination with other Regions and the Washington Office, the IntermountainRegion has adopted terminology defining the various types of communicationuses.Most of the proposed definitions for the categories of use remain unchangedor slightly modified. Modifications were in response to reviewers' commentsor to improve clarity.Slight changes were made in the following definitions (changes to improveclarity not noted):_A definition for Natural Resource and Environmental Monitoring is providedas follows: ``This use includes the transmission of telemetry data froma remote site to a central receiving station. Uses may include weatherstations, seismic stations, and snow measuring stations.''_All references to appurtenant uses are eliminated from the definitionof Radio and Television Broadcast. Appurtenant uses are discussed in theForest Service Manual Supplement.Major changes were made in the definitions of Commercial Communicator andInternal Two-way Radio. We agree with the reviewers who commented thatthe original definitions did not adequately describe the two categoriesof uses. In the final policy, the terms are defined as follows:<T3>Mobile Radio: </T3>Commercial Communications. This includes communicationequipment which is used to provide communications service to others. Thisuse may be on either a for-profit or not-for-profit basis, and may or maynot be regulated by a state public utility commission. The use requiresan FCC license. Examples of mobile radio systems in this category are commoncarrier systems, community repeaters, specialized mobile radio systems(SMRs), private carrier two-day radio systems, and private carrier pagingsystems (PCPs). Some entities in this category own and lease building,tower, and related facility space as part of their business enterpriseand may act as facility managers.<T3>Mobile Radio: </T3>Internal Communications. A private mobile radiosystem licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and usedby a single entity for the purpose of internal communications in supportof business, community activities, or other organizational objectives.The communications service is not sold to others and is limited to theuser.5. <T3>Phase-in of Fee Increases.</T3> The proposed fee schedule providedfor a 3- or 5-year phased-in of fees for current holders. It was basedon the percentage and amount of increase. There was concern that the phase-indid not adequately consider the financial impacts of the increases on someholders. There were examples of fees which exceeded 100 percent of theexisting fee in each year of the phase-in. It was feared that the rapidincrease would adversely affect the holders and their customers. As a result,the phase-in has been modified to allow a longer phase-in period.The new phase-in will provide for a maximum increase of 25 percent of theprevious year's fees with a minimum increase of $100 per year. The numberof years it takes to reach the scheduled fee will vary. However, most ofthe fee increases should be phase-in within 10 years. New holders and holdersadding new uses are not covered by the phase-in.7. <T3>Implementation. </T3>Having considered the comments the IntermountainRegion is adopting the fee schedule with the changes noted in the foregoingdiscussion of comments. The policy and procedures to guide Forest Serviceemployees in implementing the Communications Use Fee Schedule will be issuedas a Regional Supplement to Forest Service Manual Chapter 2720. The textof the supplement is set out at the end of this notice.The fee schedule will apply immediately to all new authorizations issuedon and after the effective date of this policy. The fee schedule will beimplemented for all existing special use authorizations with the billingsfor calendar year 1990.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">T.A.
