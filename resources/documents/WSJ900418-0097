The decision will make it much more difficult for acompany to refuse to bargain with a striking union byreplacing a majority of the strikers with new workers andclaiming that they oppose the union. This has been aneffective weapon for management because a company isn'trequired to recognize a union that isn't supported by amajority of its employees.</LP><TEXT>   The high court, by a 5-4 vote, said the NLRB acted withinits legal authority when it decided that employers aren'tlegally entitled to presume that workers hired during astrike are opposed to being represented by the strikingunion.   &quot;This is a major victory for organized labor,&quot; said MarvinDicker, a New York lawyer who represents management in laborcases. &quot;This gives the union a very strong hand,&quot; he said.&quot;It doesn't allow the employer to eliminate the union byreplacing the workers.&quot;   This federal labor law issue has been hotly contested. Inthe 1960s, the NLRB allowed companies to presume thatreplacement workers opposed the union. In 1975, the NLRBchanged course and ruled that replacements should be presumedto support the union.   In 1987, the NLRB again changed the policy after threefederal appeals courts ruled that replacement workers must bepresumed to be anti-union. Instead, the NLRB adopted aneutral approach that the views of workers hired during astrike can't be presumed to be either anti-union orsupportive of the union and must be determined in eachindividual labor dispute.   Yesterday, in an opinion written by Justice ThurgoodMarshall, the high court said it will defer to the expertisein labor policy of the NLRB. The court said the NLRB isn'trequired to let employers presume that strike replacementworkers oppose the union. The NLRB could change its policyagain, but that doesn't seem imminent.   The ruling means employers will have to find a way toprove that newly hired replacement workers oppose unionrepresentation. But that won't be easy for employers to do.Another NLRB rule bars an employer from polling its employeesabout union support until the employer has evidence that theunion has lost majority support.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the majorityyesterday. But he wrote a separate opinion to express&quot;considerable doubt&quot; about whether the NLRB can requireemployers to prove the views of strike replacement workersyet deny the employers the right to poll those workers.   That issue is likely to arise in a future case.&quot;Employers' next recourse is to challenge the no-pollingrule,&quot; said Mona Zeiberg of the U.S. Chamber of CommerceNational Litigation Center.   Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron R. White and JohnPaul Stevens voted in the majority. Justices Harry A.Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.Kennedy dissented yesterday.   The high court ruling was a defeat for Curtin MathesonScientific Inc., a Fisons PLC unit. The company, which sellslaboratory instruments in Houston, was struck by its union in1979. The company hired new workers and refused to negotiatewith the union. The NLRB ruled that the company had actedimproperly; but a federal appeals court in New Orleans ruledin 1988 that the company acted legally in NLRB vs. CurtinMatheson Scientific Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
