The research on high temperature materials is alsodone internationally within COST 501 (European Cooperation in the Fieldof Scientific and Technical Research). The most important results ofthis research until now are presented. First three types of fluidized-bedsystems are mentioned. Then an overview is given of the investigatedmaterials and of the experiments and testing conditions. On the basisof fluidization conditions two phases are distinguished: experimentsunder variable fluidization speed and pressure fluctuations, and experimentsunder optimized fluidization conditions. Both phases are discussed forhigh, intermediate and low temperatures. 10 figs., 11 refs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
