Buyers of single-family homes who secured an adjustable-rate mortgage in early August locked in an average effective interest rate of 9.01%, up from 8.86% in July. The August rate increase was more than twice that of July.    It was also the fourth straight monthly increase and the highest average rate commanded by flexible-rate home loans since October 1986. The figures apply to mortgages maturing in 15 years or more and include points paid by the buyer.    Meanwhile, committed rates on fixed-rate mortgages rose in August to an average 10.80% from 10.73% a month earlier. It was the highest rate level for fixed-rate home loans since January 1988.    The upward drift of mortgage rates parallels a general increase in interest rates stemming from somewhat tighter monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board.    For the third consecutive month, the rate increase of adjustable-rate mortgages was larger than the increase on fixed-rate loans. The result was a narrowing of the spread between the two rates to 1.79 percentage points. The Bank Board said 61% of the home buyers who closed their home loans in August chose adjustable-rate loans.    The Bank Board also said the purchase price of a new home in early August dropped slightly to $152,300 from a revised $152,900 in early July. </TEXT></DOC>
