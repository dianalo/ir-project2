Hun Sen had requested last week that such a meeting be held inorder to prepare for a Cambodian summit involving the Vietnam-backedgovernment and the rebel groups fighting to overthrow it.   Hun Sen also requested the participation of the two otherguerrilla factions. ``There are elements that show that afundamental agreement is possible,'' he said in a letter to Sihanouk.   Sihanouk responded by saying he would send the director of hiscabinet and another representative.   In a related development, Sihanouk announced he would meet onSunday in Beijing with the leaders of the two other guerrillafactions, Son Sann, a Western-leaning politician, and Khieu Samphan,of the Khmer Rouge.   He said the meeting would ``take all measures to reinforce theunion, solidarity, cooperation and mutual support of the threearmies of the resistance.''   The sometimes fractious alliance will probably attempt to forge aunified platform to take to Paris.   The new developments came several weeks after a regional meetingon the decade-old conflict ended without result in Jakarta,Indonesia.   At the meeting, the resistance coalition and Hun Sen's governmentdisagreed on the formation of a government after the withdrawal ofthe Vietnamese army, which has occupied the country since 1978. Theyalso are deadlocked about a mechanism for monitoring the trooppullout.   Vietnam, with the aid of the Soviet Union, invaded theChinese-backed Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia in late 1978. Anestimated 70,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia. Vietnam hassaid that it will withdraw its troops by September if the fourwarring parties can arrive at a political solution.   The Khmer Rouge killed about one million people when they ruledCambodia from 1975-78. The Vietnamese invasion drove them frompower. Still, they remain militarily the strongest of the guerrillagroups.   Cambodian guerrillas, meanwhile, reportedly recaptured a majorbase, a Thai military officer in Bangkok said today, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Son Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front retook Ampilcamp in an early morning attack on Monday, the source said.   Vietnamese forces seized Ampil in January 1985 as part of afour-month offensive in which they toppled every major guerrillastronghold along the Thai-Cambodian border. Ampil is along thecentral sector of the border.   Resistance radio ``many'' enemy soldiers were killed, but gave nofigures.</TEXT></DOC>
