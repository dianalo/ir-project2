The challenge to renew their dedication to the teachings ofJesus was issued to members Sunday at the close of the 158th AnnualGeneral Session of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   ``While we still feel the spirit of this great conference andthe words ring in our ears, let us determine how each of us can bedoers of the word and not hearers only,'' said church PresidentEzra Taft Benson in a sermon that was read by an associate.   Benson, 88, attended the conference's closing session, but askedGordon B. Hinckley, a counselor in the governing First Presidency,to read the sermon.   Benson, who suffered a heart attack last year and delivered twoaddresses on Saturday, said he was too tired to speak Sunday, achurch spokesman said.   With the closing day falling on Easter Sunday, sermons focusedon the divinity of Jesus Christ and the promise that hisresurrection and atonement offer eternal life to all who accept himand adhere to the church's teachings.   Mormons believe that theirs is the one true church, and thatchurch leaders receive revelations from Jesus. In his sermon,Benson said conference messages are as important as scripturebecause they contain communications from God.   More than 6,000 church members attended the proceedings in theTabernacle on Temple Square, and thousands more watched by livesatellite transmission in nearly 2,000 meetinghouses throughout theUnited States, Canada and Puerto Rico.   The church was founded by Joseph Smith, a 19th century religiousfigure who said he found gold plates near Palmyra, N.Y., thatdescribed a visit to America by Jesus after the crucifixion andcontained the true word of God. He wrote what he said was atranslation of the plates, which were returned to the heavenlymessenger who led Smith to them.   On Saturday, leaders announced that a record 227,284 convertsjoined the church during 1987, bringing total membership to 6.5million.</TEXT></DOC>
