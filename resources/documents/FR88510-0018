Background </ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued 5 CFR Part 1320_ControllingPaperwork Burdens on the Public_on March 31, 1983 (48 FR 13666). This ruleimplemented provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L.96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) concerning agency responsibilities for obtainingOMB approval of their collections of information, and other paperwork controlfunctions. The Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986 (section 101(m) [TitleVIII, Part A] of Pub. L. 99-500 (October 18, 1986) and 99-591 (October30, 1986), 100 Stat. 1783-335, 3341-335) amended the Paperwork ReductionAct of l980, effective October 30, 1986. As a result of these legislativeamendments, OMB published proposed changes to 5 CFR Part 1320 in a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 23, 1987 (52 FR 27768). In response to this NPRM, OMB has received comments from 19 Federal agenciesand 49 members of the public. Each comment has been considered in preparingthis final rule. In developing these amendments to 5 CFR Part 1320, OMBhas also relied upon its seven years of practical experience in administeringthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and upon its four and a half yearsof implementing 5 CFR Part 1320. Significant comments received in responseto the NPRM, and significant changes made in the amendments proposed therein,are discussed in detail below. As a convenience to those wishing to use 5 CFR Part 1320, OMB is reprintingthe entire Part as it is now amended. <ITAG tagnum="85">B. New Section 1320.21_Agency Disclosure of Estimated Burden </ITAG>In the NPRM, OMB proposed adding a new andSection; 1320.21_``Agency Displayof Estimated Burden.'' (<T3>See </T3>proposed amendment 24, 52 FR at 27772.) This section requiresagencies to indicate on each instrument for the collection of informationthe estimated average burden hours per response, together with a requestthat the public direct any comments concerning the accuracy of this burdenestimate to the agency and to OMB's Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs (OIRA). This proposal is intended to facilitate agency managementof its collections of information, to reduce paperwork burdens on the public,and to encourage more meaningful public participation in the paperworkreduction process. As discussed below, the final regulation retains thisprovision with some modification. This section drew many comments. The majority of the public comments supportedthis proposal, citing the reasons given in the preamble to the proposedrule (52 FR at 27769-27770). However, several public comments and agencycomments expressed concerns that biased or skewed responses would be receivedfrom the public (e.g., only those taking longer than average would respond),that benefits of collections of information were being ignored (e.g., beneficiariesof collections of information are not always the respondents), and thatthe costs to implement this section were too high. OMB does not find these arguments persuasive. First, since the Act's goalis to minimize the paperwork burden on the public, it is only logical thatagencies and OMB, in implementing the Act, need the input of those respondentswho are most burdened by a collection of information. As one comment stated,``[s]uch complaints are not intended to provide a statistically valid sampleof the burden, but should provide a warning of paperwork burden that maynot be justified in light of the perceived benefits'' (Comment of NationalSecurity Industrial Association).Second, this proposal does not ignore the benefits of collections of information.Agencies are already required, as part of the paperwork clearance process,to justify the uses and explain the benefits of proposed collections ofinformation to OMB. The affected public has the opportunity to supplementagency statements of need and benefit, as well as to point out the reportingburdens involved. Moreover, these descriptions of need and benefit aretypically in instructions, in regulatory preambles, and in the required<T4>Federal Register </T4>notices.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ OMB believes that the American Bar Association (ABA) Sectionof Administrative Law excellently captured these points when it statedthat:<ITAG tagnum="28">``We are aware of the arguments that this display would emphasizeonly the burden of the collection, not its benefits, and that the responsesand complaints that the agency or OMB might receive from the public asa result might be skewed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``While there is some merit to this argument, we believe that thebenefits to be derived from the display of the burden outweigh any negativeeffects. Accurate burden estimates for collections of information are criticalto the calculus to be applied under the Paperwork Reduction Act. At thesame time, agencies have a natural tendency to underrate the burden theyimpose on their respondents. Those who must comply with the collectionsare in the best position to determine the burden associated with them,but no one wants to impose another reporting requirement on these respondentsto collect the burden information. A display of the estimated burden onthe collection itself is a good compromise solution, because it is reasonableto expect that if the estimate is significantly awry, respondents willbring this to the agency's or OMB's attention. In this way, over time,the burden estimates can be refined.''</ITAG>Third, the cost of this new procedure has not been found to be high bythe one Department (Interior) currently testing this procedure on a trialbasis. A legitimate cost issue, however, does arise with the possible redesignof forms. For many forms, inclusion of this notice should require onlya modest rearrangement of the requested data items; for those forms thatcannot be easily reformatted, agencies may include this notice on the instructionsheet or on a separate, attached piece of paper. To allow adequate timeto carry this out, OMB amends andSection; 1320.21(c) to make this requirementapplicable only to collections of information and their instructions printedor otherwise reproduced (or newly communicated or transmitted to the publicby electronic or other means) after July 1, 1988.There were a number of other comments on this proposed disclosure notice.Several requested clarification on whether this notice requirement appliesto collections of information contained in or imposed by regulations submittedfor review under andSection;andSection; 1320.12 (e.g., those ``interim final''rules) and 1320.13. Section 1320.21 <T3>does </T3>apply to such collections of information because they areamong the most burdensome imposed by the Federal government.Section 1320.21, however, does <T3>not</T3> apply to collections of information in current regulationsthat are only submitted for OMB review under andSection; 1320.14. When anagency submits an information collection contained in a current regulationfor review under andSection; 1320.14, the agency does not propose changesto the current regulation, and therefore does not, as part of the clearanceprocess, include the disclosure notice in either the text or preamble tothe regulation. Instead, the agency provides the burden hour estimate andrequest for public comments as part of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice that indicates submission to OMB of theinformation collection clearance package. An agency need not engage inrulemaking solely to include the burden estimate and request for commentsrequired by andSection; 1320.21, nor need an agency engage in rulemakingevery time it revises burden estimates for collections of information containedin a current regulation, <T3>unless </T3>the regulation itself otherwise undergoes regulatory amendment.A comment requested clarification on whether the notice should be placedin the regulation's preamble or text. As proposed, andSection; 1320.21(b)provides that ``the agency may display the burden estimate and requestfor comments * * * at the beginning of the preamble to the proposed orfinal rule that contains the collection of information.'' On the otherhand, in the existing rule, andSection; 1320.7(f) already defines ``display,''as that term is used in this rule, to require that the OMB control numberbe published as part of the regulation's text, both when submitted forOMB review under andSection; 1320.13 and when issued in final.\2\<NOTE/> To eliminate this inconsistency between these two provisions,and to clarify the meaning of andSection; 1320.21(b), OMB is replacing thereferences to ``display'' in andSection; 1320.21 with the words ``disclose''and ``place.'' By ``beginning of the preamble'', OMB means at or near thebeginning of the ``<T2>Supplementary Information</T2>'' section of the proposed or final rulecontaining the collection of information. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ With the deletion of the definition of ``collection ofinformation requirement,'' the definition of ``display'' is now found inandSection; 1320.7(e). <T3>See </T3>proposed amendment 8, 52 FR at 27771. One comment recommended that the burden estimate and the request for commentsbe placed both in the text or preamble of the regulation containing thecollection of information and also on the forms or other information collectioninstruments developed or relied upon to implement the regulatory collectionof information. OMB agrees, and amends andSection; 1320.21(b) accordingly.In the <T2>``Supplementary Information'' </T2>section of the NPRM, OMB also setforth two possible standard formats for the disclosure notice, and askedwhether a standard format should be required by regulation (52 FR at 27770).Responses were received both supporting and opposing inclusion of the standardformat in the rule. One comment, with which OMB agrees, recommended placingone particular provision of the standard format into the rule. This changeto andSection; 1320.21(a)(2) requires agencies to request from the publicnot only comments concerning the accuracy of the burden estimates, butalso suggestions for reducing the burden itself. To maintain needed agency flexibility, OMB has decided not to set fortha specific standard format in the rule. Based on public comment, however,OMB recommends that agencies adopt the standard formats, as set forth below.This agency disclosure notice should be included as part of each collectionof information submitted for OMB review under the Act. Any change fromthe alternative formats set forth below should be explained in the informationcollection clearance package:<ITAG tagnum="21">Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average <T2>XX</T2> hours [or minutes] per response, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to [title and address of agency component]; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">    Or <ITAG tagnum="21">Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from <T2>XX</T2> to <T2>XX</T2> hours [or minutes] per      response, with an average of <T2>XX</T2> hours [or minutes] per      response, including time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to [title and address of agency component]; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">C. 44 U.S.C. 3507_Public Notice </ITAG>1. In new andSection; 1320.15(b), OMB proposed a new procedure for agenciesto follow when requesting an expedited review (faster than 60 days fromthe date of submission). (<T3>See </T3>proposed amendment 20, 52 FR at 27772.) This proposal wasdesigned to ensure maximum public participation in the paperwork reviewprocess. New andSection; 1320.25(b) would require an agency seeking expeditedreview to include, as part of its <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, a copy of the collection of information,together with any related instructions, for which it seeks OMB approval.An agency would also have to indicate the time period within which it isasking OMB to take action. As described below, the final regulation retainsthis requirement with some modification. Proposed new andSection; 1320.15(b) generated much comment, with almost allof the public comments supporting it and most agency comments opposingit. The agencies' major concern was the potential cost and burden it wouldimpose on them. While there will be a cost (and administrative burden)to the agencies, OMB believes that this is more than offset by the requirement'senhancement of public participation in the paperwork process. Moreover,because this additional cost or burden in andSection; 1320.15(b) is imposedonly when agencies seek expedited review, agencies may avoid the cost orburden entirely merely by allotting sufficient time for nonexpedited review.Several comments expressed concern about how this new andSection; 1320.15(b)would affect collections of information contained in proposed regulations(i.e., those submitted for OMB review under andSection; 1320.13). Such collectionsof information are not subject to andSection; 1320.15(b). Section 1320.13applies to collections of information contained in proposed rules publishedfor public comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Such publication itself offers the public theopportunity to comment. To impose a second publication requirement in andSection;1320.15(b) would be duplicative. OMB amends andSection; 1320.15 by statingmore clearly that only subsection (a), and not subsection (b), is applicableto andSection; 1320.13. Other comments raised concerns about implementation, such as informal requestsfor quick review action. This concern is best handled on a case-by-casebasis.\3\<NOTE/> If agencies know, in advance of the submission to OMB, thatthey will be requesting a quick review of a proposed collection of information,they should assume it will be treated like a request for expedited OMBreview under andSection; 1320.18(g), and they should prepare the required<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and comply with new andSection; 1320.15(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ One comment asked how to handle irregularly shaped forms.Such issues should also be discussed with OMB and handled on a case-by-casebasis. Agencies may also utilize the current emergency review procedures in andSection;1320.18(a)-(f). Several public comments suggested procedural changes to the required <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. First, they suggested delaying the startof the OMB review period until the notice is published. In order to preventexcessive delay in an agency's collection of needed information, however,the Paperwork Reduction Act generally requires OMB review to be concludedwithin sixty (and in some cases, ninety) days ``of receipt'' of a collectionof information (44 U.S.C. 3507(b)). Second, the public comments suggested that OMB establish a minimum reviewperiod. In contrast, several agencies raised a concern that the standardOMB review period would now become 60 days from receipt of the agency submission.As a general matter, this is OMB's goal, mainly to provide adequate timefor public participation in the review process. Agencies should take thistime period into consideration when setting internal agency timetablesfor the preparation of OMB review submissions. To ensure that the publicdoes receive adequate notice, agencies should also take special care tocomply with the provisions in andSection;andSection; 1320.12(a), 1320.13(b),and 1320.14(b), which require agencies to forward to the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and to OMB, on or before the day of actual submissionto OMB, the public notice indicating submission of an agency's informationcollection clearance package. Of course, emergency and expedited review procedures remain in place tohandle special, and uncontrollable, circumstances. For example, OMB takesnote of the fact that for certain types of information collections, suchas biomedical research studies, normal review periods may be far less than60 days. One concern that was raised involves requests for expedited review of collectionsof information contained in ``interim final'' regulations, referred toin one comment as ``non-notice'' regulations. In some instances, theseregulations are tied to agency enforcement actions. Depending on the natureof the enforcement action involved, pre-action disclosure of the underlyingcollection of information may enable individuals to respond in a way todefeat the purpose of the action. Thus, OMB recognizes the need for exemptionsto the requirement for advance publication, and is amending new andSection;1320.15(b) accordingly. If an agency demonstrates that advance publicationwould defeat the purpose of the collection of information, OMB will considerthe agency's request for exemption. 2. In new andSection; 1320.15(a), ``<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of OMB review,'' OMB proposed to establishby regulation the content of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice that each agency is required to publishwhen submitting a paperwork clearance package to OMB for review under theAct. (<T3>See </T3>proposed amendment 20, 52 FR at 27772.) The notice would berequired to contain, at a minimum, a title for the collection; a briefdescription of the need, use, likely respondents, frequency of response,and burden estimates disaggregated into discrete components applicableto each separate information collection instrument; the average hours perresponse; the frequency of response; and the likely number of respondents.Furthermore, OMB encouraged agencies to state the basis for their burdenestimates. As described below, the final regulation adopts this proposedamendment. Comments on this new andSection; 1320.15(a) both supported and opposed disaggregatingburden estimates. Those in opposition (primarily agencies) expressed concernsabout the additional cost and administrative burden imposed on them bythis proposal, and asserted that it would duplicate information providedto OMB in the agency information collection clearance packages. Publiccomments, however, clearly supported this section. Unless potential respondentsreceive notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of the estimated burden to be imposed upon them,they will probably lack the incentive to contact the agency to requesta copy of the information collection clearance package, and thus be unableto provide the agency and OMB with timely and meaningful comments. Indeed,many public comments expressed a desire for additional information in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, including the inclusion of OMB approvalnumbers, agency form numbers, more extensive discussions of major changesto collections or summaries of new collections, bases for burden estimates,and requested expiration dates.OMB believes the public's need for the information proposed to be includedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice outweighs the potential increase in agencyburdens and costs. The need for the additional information that the publiccomments recommended, however, is not so clear. OMB, therefore, is notadopting any expansion of this proposal.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Several agencies raised concerns about specific situationsin which they asserted that disaggregating burden estimates in particularways would impose substantial burden without commensurate benefits to thepublic, e.g., in those cases in which different categories of respondentsfill out different portions of a form, or fill out the form at differentintervals. These cases should be discussed individually with OMB and handledon a case-by-case basis. 3. The proposed addition to andSection; 1320.4(b)(3) would require agenciesto indicate in their collection of information clearance packages whatpracticable steps they have taken to consult with interested agencies andmembers of the public in order to minimize the burden of the collectionof information. (<T3>See</T3> proposed amendment 3, 52 FR at 27771.) The final regulationadopts this section as proposed. Public comments supported this amendment, with several suggesting thatadditional information be included in the clearance packages. These suggestionsincluded required discussions of why sampling or other less burdensomecollection procedures were not undertaken, and discussions of the potentialuses of comparable (not just duplicative) data. OMB has not adopted thesesuggestions. OMB is now able to raise these and other appropriate concernswith the agency as part of its review of each agency's information collectionclearance package. 4. The NPRM's Supplementary Information section discussed 44 U.S.C. 3507(h),which requires, with one exception, that any written communication betweenOIRA and an agency or a member of the public concerning a proposed collectionof information be made available to the public (52 FR at 27769). OMB emphasizedits support for this provision. However, OMB also raised in the NPRM aconcern that complaints from possible whistleblowers about a collectionof information might be hindered if these complainants believe that thesponsoring agency reviewing a substantive complaint will be able to identifythem and institute possible actions of reprisal, such as more intensifiedregulatory enforcement, or a denial of a grant or other benefits. OMB received a number of comments on this discussion, several supportingit, others expressing concerns about it, and still others requesting clarification.For the purposes of clarification, OMB reiterates that it will follow thelegal requirements set forth in 44 U.S.C. 3507(h), notwithstanding thediscussion of the Privacy Act in the NPRM. Thus, those who provide OMBwith any communications concerning a proposed collection of information,regardless of whether they request confidentiality, should recognize thatwritten communications concerning such collections of information willbe made available to the public and also, as a general matter, to the sponsoringagency, except for those involving classified information. OMB remains concerned about the potential discouragement of possible whistleblowers.As such, those who wish to submit comments on proposed collections of information,but who do not wish to be identified to the sponsoring agency, may needto consider in advance how best to do so. A comment from the ABA Sectionof Administrative Law suggested submission of anonymous comments, but questionedwhether OMB would ``discount comments submitted anonymously.'' OMB wantsto assure the public that any substantive comment received on proposedcollections of information, whether or not submitted anonymously, throughan intermediary (e.g., a public interest group or a trade association),or with full disclosure of source, will be considered as part of any paperworkreview and brought to the attention of the appropriate agency. The paperwork clearance file will contain all written, nonclassified communications,including those submitted anonymously or through intermediaries, and willbe publicly available in OMB's docket library. Moreover, and as requiredby 44 U.S.C. 3507(b), any determination to approve, modify, or disapprovea proposed collection of information and explanation thereof shall be publiclyavailable.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. 44 U.S.C. 3502(11)_OMB Clearance Procedures</ITAG>Several comments discussed proposed amendments to clarify the applicabilityof the public protection provisions in 44 U.S.C. 3512 (<T3>see </T3>proposed amendments 4 and 5, 52 FR at 27771) and, more generally,numerous technical amendments replacing the terms ``information collectionrequest'' and ``collection of information requirement'' with the term ``collectionof information.'' \5\<NOTE/> The purpose of this action was, consistent with the 1986amendment to 44 U.S.C. 3502(11), to make clear (unless circumscribed bythe clearance procedures in 44 U.S.C. 3504(h), involving collections ofinformation contained in proposed regulations) that all of the provisionsof the Act apply to any collection of information, whether called for bya printed form, oral question, or a proposed or current rule. These provisionsinclude, among many, the public protection provisions of the Act, the required<T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, and the three-year limit on the durationof an OMB approval of a collection of information. (<T3>See </T3>52 FR at 27768-69.)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ For example, in response to one comment, OMB amends section1320.14(i) to state more clearly which collections of information wouldno longer be valid upon receiving a disapproval from OMB pursuant to thatsection.Several comments expressed concern with the statutory, three-year limit,namely, that an agency might try to nullify regulatory provisions for reportingor recordkeeping simply by allowing OMB approval for a collection of informationcontained in a current regulation to expire. OMB believes that this fearis unfounded. Congress debated and agreed to the three-year limit to OMBapprovals when it enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act in 1980.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ OMB stated the underlying rationale for this three-yearlimit in the NPRM:<ITAG tagnum="28">``[T]he three-year limit to paperwork approval, combined with thenotice provisions in the Act, gives the public the opportunity to commenton any collection of information (including any recordkeeping requirement)contained in a current rule every three years, not just when the rule wasfirst issued. After a respondent has complied with a collection of information(including a recordkeeping requirement) contained in a current rule forseveral years, the respondent should have clearer knowledge of the burdensinvolved, and the agency more concrete experience with the practical utilityof the information obtained. Through this iterative review process, theagency is able on a continuing basis to improve and reduce the burden ofits collection of information.'' (52 FR at 27768.)</ITAG>More recently, when recommending passage of the 1986 Amendments, the SenateCommittee on Governmental Affairs explicitly discounted the danger thatan agency might nullify these regulatory provisions simply by allowingOMB approval to expire:<ITAG tagnum="21">If an agency fails to resubmit a collection of information requirementafter its clearance expires, the public protection clause of the Act wouldpreclude the agency from penalizing persons who fail to respond to thecollection of information requirement. However, the rule requiring thecollection of information would remain in effect, and in the committee'sview the agency could be sued successfully for failing to enforce its ownrules [``Federal Management Reorganization and Cost Control Act of 1986,''Report to accompany S. 2230, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,July 31, 1986, Report 99-347].</ITAG>In addition to these protections, OMB requires all agencies to submit collectionsof information contained in rules for review 90 days prior to the currentexpiration dates (andSection; 2320.14(a)). Every month, OMB routinely sendsagency information collection clearance offices chronological listingsof every collection of information that is going to expire within 120 days.Thus, agencies that do not seek to renew a collection of information inan existing rule are in violation of the OMB rule. To prevent inadvertentnoncompliance with 5 CFR Part 1320, agencies should establish informationcollection management tracking systems. In response to comments from theABA Section of Administrative Law, OMB is amending 5 CFR 1320.14(a) tostress the importance of agency compliance with this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Other Amendments </ITAG>The NPRM proposed a number of other amendments, including having agenciesconsider reducing burden through the use of automated collection techniquesor other forms of information technology (andSection; 1320.6(k); <T3>see </T3>proposed amendment 7, 52 FR at 27771), having OMB make publiclyavailable any OMB decision to approve or disapprove a collection of informationand explanation thereof (andSection; 1320.11(d); <T3>see </T3>proposed amendment 9, 52 FR at 27771), and emergency processingrequirements (andSection; 1320.18; <T3>see </T3>proposed amendment 22, 52 FR at 27772). These amendments proposedin the NPRM received few substantive comments, and are adopted as proposed.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Upon further review of 5 CFR Part 1320, OMB has also decidedto make the following technical amendments: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Various provisions in 5 CFR Part 1320 have taken effect on differentdates. For example, OMB published amendments to this  Part on May 16, 1984(49 FR 20792). As a result, the last sentence of andSection; 1320.2, whichmade this regulation effective on May 2, 1983, is obsolete and is thereforedeleted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) OMB amends andSection; 1320.6(e) to clarify that it applies to collectionsof information that provide for any payment or gift to respondents or potentialrespondents, including but not limited to compensation of respondents fortheir time or other costs incurred in providing the information requested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) The Civil Aeronautics Board no longer exists. The reference toit in andSection; 1320.7(h) is therefore deleted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) OMB amends andSection; 1320.16(c) to state clearly that the newamendments to 5 CFR Part 1320 also apply to Standard and Optional Forms,and to any other collections of information prescribed by another agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(5) OMB amends section 1(e) of Appendix A to correct two cross-references(the prior references to andSection;andSection; 1320.17 and 1320.19 are changed,respectively, to andSection;andSection; 1320.18 and 1320.20). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">F. Additional Public Comments </ITAG>In response to the NPRM, OMB  also received a number of comments which,although they concern OMB's paperwork review practices, neither addressparticular proposed amendments in the NPRM nor suggest alternative amendments.Although OMB is not obligated to respond to such comments, a few of themraise issues of widespread concern or interest. OMB therefore believesthat a short discussion of these is worthwhile. 1. Several comments expressed a desire for OMB to explain how it reviewscollections of information. OMB is now drafting an ``Information CollectionReview Handbook'' for use by OMB staff. When it is completed, the Handbookwill be provided to agencies and to interested members of the public. ThisHandbook will describe agency and OMB responsibilities under the PaperworkReduction Act, the scope of the information collection review program,the information collection review process, the types of information collectionsthat are and are not covered by the Act, the criteria for obtaining OMBapproval, and public involvement in OMB reviews. Some comments raised the kinds of issues that will be discussed in theHandbook. For example, the ABA Section of Administrative Law questionedwhether it was OMB's intent to approve collections of information in anexisting rule during the time agencies may seek to amend or repeal thosecollections of information through a regulatory amendment. Similarly, anagency asked OMB to clarify, when OMB approves a collection of informationcontained in a proposed regulation, whether an existing, related regulatoryinformation collection remains in force until the new regulatory informationcollection can take effect through completion of the amendatory rulemaking.\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ To answer these questions: A proposed regulatory informationcollection is reviewed under andSection; 1320.13. A current regulatory informationcollection is reviewed under andSection; 1320.14. As a basic matter, if aninformation collection in a proposed rule is going to change an informationcollection in a current rule, the agency should take care to assure thatthe existing regulatory information collection continues to be approvedby OMB while the agency is conducting the regulatory amendment. <ITAG tagnum="28">In addition, it is OMB practice to assure that this happens. WhenOMB approves a proposed regulatory information collection under andSection;1320.13, OMB allows the related current regulatory information collectionto remain in effect until the approved, new or revised regulatory informationcollection takes effect, unless otherwise noted_in particular circumstances_inthe conditions of clearance. Similarly, even when OMB fails to approvea proposed regulatory information collection submitted for review underandSection; 1320.13, but instead files public comments, OMB approves therelated current regulatory information collection for at least as longas it takes to resolve the dispute.</ITAG>2. Several comments questioned whether financial monitoring, audit requirements,and audit guides are covered by the Act. The answer varies from case tocase, depending on whether the audit guide contains ``identical'' reportingor recordkeeping requirements (see the amendment to andSection; 1320.7(c)),and on whether the collection of information has been previously approvedas part of another paperwork clearance (see 48 FR 13675, March 31, 1983).3. Comments also expressed a concern about the Information Collection Budget(ICB). While the ICB was not the subject of the rulemaking, it is importantto clarify an apparent misperception concerning the ICB and how it is used.The ICB is a management tool and it is an adjunct to the individual case-by-casereview required by the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB's paperwork clearanceprocedures. It is used by agency officials in their planning and controlprocesses to review the totality of the collections of information theirstaff plans to keep, or put, in place during the forthcoming year. OMBuses the ICB in conjunction with its management reviews of agencies, toassure that they comply with the Act's direction to manage informationneeds and uses carefully. Some comments suggested that, through the ICB,OMB may disapprove a collection of information. This is inaccurate; disapprovalsof collections of information may occur only as part of OMB's case-by-casereview of each information collection clearance package, in accordancewith the procedures and policies of the Act. 4. Several members of the public asserted that OMB, in implementing thePaperwork Reduction Act, spends too much time and effort in reviewing collectionsof information imposed on businesses. OMB believes that this criticismis unwarranted, and that it may arise due to a lack of public awarenessof how the Federal government's paperwork burden weighs upon the varioussegments of our society. OMB records indicate that as of September 30,1987, agencies estimated that approximately 63 percent of all Federal reportingburden fell on businesses and other institutions (including hospitals anduniversities), while 32 percent of the total fell on individuals and households,4 percent on State and local governments, and l percent on farms. Brokendown by major Federal agency, the imposition of reporting and recordkeepingburden by respondent category is, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Active Information Collections, the Affected Public, Percent of BurdenHours by Agency</T4><H1>Agency \9\ </H1><H1>Individuals/households (percent) </H1><H1>State/local government (percent) </H1><H1>Farms (percent) </H1><H1>Business and other institutions (percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Agriculture <D>22 </D><D>64 </D><D>10 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Commerce <D>16 </D><D>9 </D><D>0 </D><D>75 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Defense <D>3 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>97 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Education <D>30 </D><D>10 </D><D>0 </D><D>60 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Energy <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>1 </D><D>99 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">HHS <D>15 </D><D>9 </D><D>0 </D><D>76 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">HUD <D>2 </D><D>53 </D><D>0 </D><D>45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Interior <D>10 </D><D>18 </D><D>0 </D><D>72 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Justice <D>83 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>17 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Labor <D>1 </D><D>6 </D><D>0 </D><D>93 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">State <D>99 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DOT <D>2 </D><D>4 </D><D>0 </D><D>94 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treasury <D>51 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>49 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CFTC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CPSC <D>2 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>98 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">EEOC <D>0 </D><D>98 </D><D>0 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">EPA <D>1 </D><D>3 </D><D>0 </D><D>96 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FCC <D>1 </D><D>2 </D><D>0 </D><D>97 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FDIC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FEMA <D>13 </D><D>87 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FERC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FHLBB <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FRS <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">FTC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">GSA <D>4 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>96 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ICC <D>3 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>97 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NASA <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NCUA <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NSF <D>15 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>85 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NRC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">OPM <D>96 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SEC <D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>0 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">SBA <D>10 </D><D>1 </D><D>0 </D><D>89 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">VA <D>83 </D><D>2 </D><D>0 </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All Government <D>32 </D><D>4 </D><D>1 </D><D>63  </D><F>\9\ The abbreviated agencies are as follows: HHS=Health and Human Services;HUD=Housing and Urban Development; DOT=Transportation; CFTC=Commodity FuturesTrading Commission; CPSC=Consumer Product Safety Commission; EEOC=EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission; EPA=Environmental Protection Agency;FCC=Federal Communications Commission; FDIC=Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;FEMA=Federal Emergency Management Agency; FERC=Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission; FHLBB=Federal Home Loan Bank Board; FRS=Federal Reserve System;FTC=Federal Trade Commission; GSA=General Services Administration; ICC=InterstateCommerce Commission; NASA=National Aeronautics and Space Administration;NCUA=National Credit Union Administration; NSF=National Science Foundation;NRC=Nuclear Regulatory Commission; OPM=Office of Personnel Management;SEC=Securities and Exchange Commission; SBA=Small Business Administration;VA=Veterans' Administration.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis </ITAG>OMB has analyzed the effects of this rule under both Executive Order No.12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

An agency shall not continueto engage in such collection of information after the expiration date ofthe control number, unless OMB has approved an extension. Each agency shallensure that collections of information required by law or necessary toobtain a benefit, and which are submitted to nine or fewer persons, informpotential respondents that the collection of information is not subjectto OMB review under the Act.(b) To obtain OMB approval of a collection of information, an agency shalldemonstrate that it has taken every reasonable step to ensure that:(1) The collection of information is the least burdensome necessary forthe proper performance of the agency's functions to comply with legal requirementsand achieve program objectives;(2) The collection of information is not duplicative of information otherwiseaccessible to the agency; and(3) The collection of information has practical utility. The agency shallalso seek to minimize the cost to itself of collecting, processing, andusing the information, but shall not do so by means of shifting disproportionatecosts or burdens onto the public. It shall also comply with the generalinformation collection guidelines set out in andSection; 1320.6, where applicable,and shall indicate, in its submission of a collection of information forOMB review, what practicable steps it has taken to consult with interestedagencies and members of the public in order to minimize the burden of thatcollection of information.(c) OMB shall determine whether the collection of information, as submittedby the agency, is necessary for the proper performance of the agency'sfunctions. In making this determination, OMB will take into account thecriteria listed in andSection; 1320.4(b), and will consider whether the burdenof the collection of information is justified by its practical utility.In addition:(1) OMB will consider necessary any collection of information specificallymandated by statute or court order, but will independently assess any collectionof information to the extent that the agency exercises discretion in itsimplementation; and(2) OMB will consider necessary any collection of information specificallyrequired by an agency rule approved or not acted upon by OMB pursuant toandSection;andSection; 1320.13 or 1320.14, but will independently assess anysuch collection of information to the extent that it deviates from thespecifications of the rule.(d) Except as provided in andSection;

In the Act,a ``collection of information requirement'' is a type of ``informationcollection request.'' As used in this Part, a ``collection of information''refers to the act of collecting information, to the information to be collected,to a plan and/or an instrument calling for the collection of information,or any of these, as appropriate.

Retired and other former Federal employees are includedentirely within the definition of ``person.'' (o) ``Practical utility'' means the actual, not merely the theoreticalor potential, usefulness of information to an agency, taking into accountits accuracy, adequacy, and reliability, and the agency's ability to processthe information in a useful and timely fashion.

In the case of general purpose statisticsor recordkeeping requirements, ``practical utility'' means that actualuses can be demonstrated. (p) ``Recordkeeping requirement'' means a requirement imposed by an agencyon persons to maintain specified records and includes requirements thatinformation be maintained or retained by persons but not necessarily providedto an agency. (q) ``Reporting requirement'' means a requirement imposed by an agencyon persons to provide information to another person or to the agency. Reportingrequirements may implicitly or explicitly include related recordkeepingrequirements.(r) ``Sponsor.'' A Federal agency is considered to ``sponsor'' the collectionof information if the agency collects the information, causes another agencyto collect the information, contracts or enters into a cooperative agreementwith a person to collect the information, or requires a person to provideinformation to another person. A collection of information undertaken bya recipient of a Federal grant is considered to be ``sponsored'' by anagency only if: (1) The recipient of a grant is collecting information at the specificrequest of the agency; or (2) The terms and conditions of the grant require specific approval bythe agency of the collection of information or the collection procedures.(s) ``Ten or more persons'' refers to the persons to whom a collectionof information is addressed by the agency within any 12-month period, andto any independent entities to which the initial addressee may reasonablybe expected to transmit the collection of information during that period,including independent state or local entities and separately incorporatedsubsidiaries or affiliates, but not including employees of the respondentwithin the scope of their employment, or contractors engaged for the purposeof complying with the collection of information.

(A) Should the Board determine that a new collection of information ora change in an existing collection must be instituted quickly and thatpublic participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose ofthe collection or substantially interfere with the Board's ability to performits statutory obligation, the Board may approve of the collection of informationwithout providing opportunity for public comment. At the earliest practicaldate after approving the collection of information, the Board will publisha <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice informing the public of its approval ofthe collection of information and indicating why immediate action was necessary.(B) In such cases, before taking final action to reauthorize the collectionof information for an additional period, the Board will take into accountany comments received after the institution of the collection.
