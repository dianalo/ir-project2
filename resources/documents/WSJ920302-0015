Under the agreement between the EPA and several health andenvironmental groups, the federal agency has until March 1,1993, to decide whether to revise its current standards forozone smog.</LP><TEXT>   If the standards change, states will have to implement therevised allowable ozone levels in the air pollution plansthey are required to formulate under the Clean Air Act.   The agreement, which was signed by U.S. District JudgeJohn R. Bartels of New York City, comes in a case brought bythe American Lung Association and other environmental andhealth groups, as well as five state attorneys general. Theenvironmental groups sued the EPA last year demanding areview of the ozone standards which have not changed since1979. The environmental groups believe the standards areoutdated and need to be tougher.   &quot;We're confident that the evidence does indicate the needto revise the standards,&quot; said Ron White, environmentalhealth director of the American Lung Association.   Martin Baker, an attorney at the New York law firm Stroockandamp; Stroock andamp; Lavan, which represented the environmentalgroups, said, &quot;the EPA has been stonewalling.&quot;   Henry V. Nickel, an attorney for a consortium of 60electrical utilities, said his clients oppose Judge Bartels'sorder because it doesn't allow the utilities the right to askfor additional time to comment on any proposed change instandards. Judge Bartels denied a request by the utilities tointervene in the case and they are appealing that ruling.   &quot;There's a lot of new information on ozone out there,&quot;said Mr. Nickel of the Washington office of Hunton andamp;Williams. He said that not all of the data has beenthoroughly reviewed and that the utilities may need more timeto develop a position on ozone standards.   Attorneys for the EPA could not be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
