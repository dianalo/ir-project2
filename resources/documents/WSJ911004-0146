ATandamp;T has been trying in the past seven years to rebuildand expand the international presence it enjoyed beforeantitrust regulators forced it to abandon its overseasbusiness in the 1920s.   The company has broadened its long-distance services toinclude new offerings such as international toll-freecalling, high-speed data transmission, and networkmanagement. To improve transmission, ATandamp;T-led consortia arespending more than $3 billion on high-speed underseafiber-optic cables.   In telecommunications equipment, ATandamp;T has established afirm foothold in Europe and the Far East, including Italy,Spain, Holland and Indonesia.   All told, ATandamp;T derives about 15% of its $37 billion inannual revenue overseas and employs about 22,000 peopleoutside the U.S. NCR Corp., which ATandamp;T will acquire thisfall, will add more than $3 billion to ATandamp;T's internationalrevenue and about 27,000 workers outside the U.S.                                                                                                          MCI Communications Corp.                                                                                                          ATandamp;T's long-time nemesis is beginning to challenge theU.S. giant overseas through its MCI International unit, whichprovides direct dialing from the U.S. to 180 countries andinternational toll-free service to 25 countries.   MCI formed its international unit in 1983 after buyingWestern Union International Inc. from Xerox Corp. Five yearslater it cemented its ties to many foreign telephoneauthorities when it bought RCA Global Communications Inc.from General Electric Co.   Much of MCI's future traffic will travel through thetrans-Atlantic high-capacity fiber-optic cable beingconstructed with its partner, British Telecommunications PLC.   More recently, MCI began offering a Global CommunicationService. This service manages international voice and datanetworks, provides billing in any currency, and negotiatestransmission links with foreign telecommunicationsauthorities. MCI owns 25% of Infonet, an international datanetwork, which is also partly owned by 10 telecommunicationsadministrations in Europe and Asia.                                                                                                          US Sprint Communications Co.                                                                                                          The third-largest long-distance phone company in the U.S.,a subsidiary of United Telecommunications Inc. in Westwood,Kan., is expanding in three areas: traffic between countries;multinational private networks; and the so-calledcarrier-select market, in which travelers can select thelong-distance carrier of their choice when placing aninternational call from another country.   Aiding this expansion is Private TransatlanticTelecommunications (PTAT), a fiber-optic cable system thatSprint owns 50-50 with Britain's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC. Sprintalso owns SprintNet, an international public data networkthat has links to 108 countries, and is building a secondprivate data network, linking financial centers in Europe andthe Pacific Rim through switching hubs in 20 countries.   Recent international projects include management of a15-nation data network used by Unilever Group; a contract tobuild an electronic data network for Poland's largest bank;and a high-speed data network in Scandinavia.                                                                                                          British Telecommunications PLC                                                                                                          Hit hard by the cold forces of market liberalization,which are picking away at its comfortable monopoly, Britain'sphone company has sought growth overseas -- so far with mixedresults.   British Telecom owns Tymnet, an international data networkproviding global transmission to corporations. Earlier thisyear, British Telecom began setting up a U.S.-basedsubsidiary, called Syncordia Corp., which will manage globalcorporate networks. British Telecom is also readying ahigh-speed data-transport system using technology theindustry has dubbed &quot;frame relay.&quot; The system will linkcomputer networks in the U.S. and overseas.   These newer ventures, which focus on the high-margincorporate market, should help expand British Telecom's baseand make up for previous investment bombs, including thepurchase of Mitel Corp., a money-losing Canadian equipmentmaker.   But British Telecom has more than enough resources. Itrecently came under fire from politicians at home for earning$3.64 billion, 35% more than the year before.                                                                                                          Cable andamp; Wireless PLC                                                                                                          Britain's other big telecommunications player launched itsMercury Communications phone service 10 years ago and now isa formidable rival of British Telecom for business phoneservices.   Cable andamp; Wireless is building a &quot;global digital highway,&quot;which will link Cable andamp; Wireless networks in Britain(Mercury), the U.S. (Cable andamp; Wireless Communications, thefourth-largest long-distance company in the U.S.) and thePacific Rim (Hong Kong Telecommunications). Another service,called Planet, will allow a customer to open a new office ina foreign country and automatically plug into the advancedvoice and data services offered through Cable andamp; Wireless'snetwork.   Cable andamp; Wireless knows something about operatinginternationally. It built overseas local phone systems,mostly in territories closely linked to the British Empire,including Hong Kong and the Caribbean.   A vital link in Cable andamp; Wireless's digital system is thePTAT trans-Atlantic cable systems, which the company ownswith Sprint.                                                                                                          Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp.                                                                                                          Japan's phone company is limited to providing localservice in Japan. But this hasn't stopped it from pursuinginternational business through partly owned subsidiaries,including NTT International.   NTT has been a rumored partner in British Telecom'sPathfinder service. NTT has also set up NTT DataCommunications Systems Corp. in Jersey City, N.J., to capturedata traffic from Japanese companies doing business in theU.S.   NTT's research and development is often shared withJapanese equipment suppliers such as Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp.and Oki Electric Ltd. These companies then push productsincorporating NTT's designs in international markets.                                                                                                          France Telecom.                                                                                                          France's main telephone company has been expanding intoother countries, pushing discount terrestrial and satellitelinks for corporate networks.   France Telecom is also drumming up interest in its Minitelinformation service. This enables more than 5.5 millionFrench subscribers to get access to phone listings, chatlines, restaurant reviews and other services using a smallcomputer terminal provided by the phone company.   France Telecom is trying to persuade local phone carrierssuch as the Baby Bells in the U.S. and administrations inother countries to create a transmission standard for sendingsuch messages. This, says France Telecom, would also increaseusage among French phone subscribers, who could have accessto a wider group of services outside France.   Minitel is mostly received by French customers. The BabyBells, including U S West Inc. and Southwestern Bell Corp.,have conducted consumer tests of the service. But a bigAmerican market for Minitel has yet to emerge.                                                                                                          Intelsat                                                                                                          The International Telecommunications SatelliteOrganization is a global cooperative that controls most ofthe world's satellite transmission.   Intelsat's ownership is divided among companiesrepresenting 121 countries. The U.S. signatory is theCommunications Satellite Corp. Comsat arranges all U.S.satellite links with Intelsat, including service from theU.S. long-distance carriers ATandamp;T and MCI.   Services carried by Intelsat's network of 14communications satellites include television broadcasting,telecommunications and private data links. While Intelsatdominates satellite transmission, some private outfits led byPan American Satellite Corp. are challenging Intelsat'sdominance. PanAmSat is already running private transmissionservices to several countries.   Alcatel N.V.                                                                                                          France's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, aunit of Alcatel Alsthom, cemented its position as a worldforce in 1987 when it purchased the international equipmentoperations of ITT Corp. The acquisition put Alcatel squarelyin numerous key markets, including Germany, Belgium, Italy,Spain and China.   Alcatel has had a rough time in the U.S. phone-switchmarket, losing ground to other entrants such as Telefon ABL.M. Ericsson of Sweden and Germany's Siemens AG. But thatmarket has slowed, with most analysts expecting higher growthrates in the market for fiber-optic transmission equipment.   In that business Alcatel's ace may be a new line ofsystems designed to a world standard called SynchronousOptical Network, or Sonet. Sonet will accelerate theconstruction of high-capacity voice and data networks, andAlcatel was one of the first companies to ship Sonet systemsin the U.S. This has helped Alcatel land big contracts fromseveral Baby Bells.                                                                                                          Motorola Inc.                                                                                                          The world's largest maker of radio-communicationsequipment has stumbled badly in the cellular-network market,losing huge equipment contracts to Ericsson and ATandamp;T.   But Motorola's technology partnership with NorthernTelecom Ltd. could help re-establish the company in theemerging market in the U.S. and overseas for newer digitalnetworks.   Meanwhile, Motorola continues to lead the field inwireless communications devices. It recently began sellingthe lightest pocketphone in the cellular industry, keepingits lead over competitors such as the Japanese and Ericsson.Motorola also has plans to build an international network ofminiature communications satellites, which would linkcustomers using special portable phones in a new networkservice. In the data-transmission arena, Motorola recentlybegan selling a local-area network system that transmitscomputer information via radio waves.                                                                                                          Northern Telecom Ltd.                                                                                                          Canada's telecommunications-equipment maker isencountering the same problem that ATandamp;T has found in the U.S.equipment market: slow growth.   However, in the past year Northern has posted strong gainsin the European, the Caribbean and the Latin Americanequipment markets.   ATandamp;T's primary equipment rival has also established a firmfoothold in Japan, becoming NTT's primary outside source ofdigital switching equipment. Elsewhere, Northern has landedorders from telephone authorities in Germany and Holland. InBritain, Northern last year acquired STC Corp., one ofBritain's biggest telecommunications-equipment suppliers.   But the biggest market for future expansion may be EasternEurope, where several former Soviet satellites, nowdemocratized, are trying to modernize their phone systems. Inlate July Northern landed a $120 million contract to supplythe first of Poland's new non-national phone companies withnetwork equipment. Northern will also build switches inPoland for the local market.                                                                                                          Siemens AG                                                                                                          Germany's largest telecommunications company currentlysupplies equipment for digital phone switching andtransmission to more than 100 telephone authorities aroundthe world.   Most of Siemens's expansion in recent years has been inthe U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., Siemens ownsStromberg-Carlson Corp., the third-largesttelecommunications-equipment maker in this country. Siemensalso holds 50% of Rolm Co., a supplier of office-phoneswitching equipment; the other half is owned by InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. And Siemens shares ownership withCorning Inc. in Siecor, one of the largest U.S. suppliers offiber-optic cable.   More recently Siemens began to remedy its late entry intothe cellular business by setting up a unit to build andmarket cellular phones and network equipment to be used infuture digital cellular systems. Seven European countrieshave ordered Siemens digital-cellular-network equipment.   Another big target will be Eastern Europe, which isbeginning to rebuild its long-neglected telephone systems.The state-owned Deutsche Bundespost, which runs the Germanphone system, is drawing up ambitious plans to build a newphone network in eastern Germany to rival that of the rest ofthe country. And Siemens stands to get much of this business.                                                                                                          NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd.                                                                                                          Japan's two telecommunications giants dominate thecounty's telecommunications-equipment industry and most Asianmarkets.   But NEC and Fujitsu have come up short so far in the U.S.market for switches used by telephone companies. They've alsostumbled badly in the office-switch market, slipping farbehind ATandamp;T, Northern Telecom, Rolm and others because ofweak marketing, distribution and software programs.   Fiber optics is another story. Both companies haveparlayed their laser expertise to become powerhouses in thefiber-optice-quipment business. To complement itstransmission line, Fujitsu is readying a high-speed exchangethat switches optical signals.   Cellular is another target. Fujitsu and NEC have madetremendous inroads in the fast-growing market forpocket-sized cellular phones. While Motorola is currentlyleading the industry with the lightest phones, Fujitsu, NECand other Japanese suppliers such as Mitsubishi Corp. havebegun to narrow the gap with their own sleek models. To backup its U.S. marketing effort, Fujitsu recently opened an $80million, 370,000-square-foot Telecommunications Center inRichardson, Texas. The facility is Fujitsu's largest researchand manufacturing site outside of Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
