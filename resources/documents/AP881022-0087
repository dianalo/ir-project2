(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kidley Street seems too quiet tobe a battleground.   But Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis areskirmishing there and throughout Macomb County and throughout thenation for the votes of so-called Reagan Democrats.   The county's predominantly white, middle-class voters bolted toRonald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 while they supported Democraticcandidates on most of the ballot _ as did many Democrats elsewherein the country.   Macomb is ``an absolute 100 percent predictor of how Michigan'sgoing to vote,'' said Jay Neel, whom the Democratic NationalCommittee sent here in August to run a storefront Dukakis campaignoffice in St. Clair Shores. ``And without Michigan, we're not goingto win.''   Terry Gilsenan of Warren, a Republican district chairman,agrees. ``If you don't carry (Macomb) county, you don't carry thestate,'' he said.   Bordering predominantly black Detroit on the north and mainlywhite, affluent Oakland County on the east, Macomb and its 700,000residents are what Neel calls ``a microcosm of the country.''   Auto industry factories and rows of bungalow houses crowd EightMile Road, the county's southern border. Farther north are largehomes, apartment buildings, condominiums and newer factories, andbeyond them are mobile home parks and new subdivisions. A dwindlingnumber of farms and small towns are found in Macomb's northernmostreaches.   On Kidley Street, the middle-class, dual-income Zaleski andTremaine families are linked by their sons, Jason Zaleski and JohnTremaine, who are pals at Adlai Stevenson High School. But theirparents' divergent political leanings reflect the challenge facingBush and Dukakis.   ``I don't think my luck has increased through the Republicanadministrations,'' said Stanley Zaleski, a carpenter who voted forDemocrats Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Walter Mondale in 1984.   ``I don't think I've made many great strides,'' he said. ``I'vegot to run like hell just to keep up with things.''   Zaleski plans to cast an unenthusiastic vote for Dukakis. ``He'sthe lesser of two evils. The Democrats at least do try to help theworking man,'' he explains.   Theresa Tremaine, a computer programmer, describes herself as alukewarm Democrat who voted for Carter in 1980 but switched toReagan in 1984 and plans to vote this time for Bush.   If Mrs. Tremaine is a Reagan Democrat, the phenomenon sherepresents goes back further than Reagan. The last Democraticpresidential candidate to carry Macomb County was Hubert Humphreyin 1968. Richard Nixon won the county and state by comfortablemargins in 1972 and Gerald Ford did the same in 1976.   Dukakis isn't writing off Macomb County partly becauseotherwise, it's a staunch Democratic stronghold. Two of its threeHouse members, 11 of its 12 state legislators and 24 of its 25county commissioners are Democrats.   ``They were conservative Democrats long before Reagan camealong,'' said Kirby Holmes, a former GOP state legislator fromUtica. ``They just didn't like the presidential candidates that thenational party put forth.''   Anti-tax sentiment is strong in Macomb. In the early 1980s,voters recalled a state legislator who voted to raise Michigan'sincome tax.   Abortion is a touchy issue among its Roman Catholics, as areU.S.-Soviet relationships among its Eastern European ethnic groupsand crime among auto workers who led the white flight from Detroitto the suburbs after the city's 1967 race riots.   Dukakis' task is to persuade Macomb's Reagan Democrats that heis less liberal than past Democratic presidential nominees GeorgeMcGovern, Carter and Mondale, and that the gains Reagan boasts havebeen illusory for them.   The unemployment rate in Macomb County is running about 6.8percent, somewhat higher than the national rate of 5.6 percent inAugust.   Recent local polls indicate that only one in five MacombDemocrats who voted for Reagan in 1984 might vote for Bush inNovember.   Dukakis made a highly publicized visit Sept. 13 to a GeneralDynamics Corp. factory in Sterling Heights, where he rode in an M-1tank to underscore a speech stressing his commitment to a strongU.S. military.   Bush campaigned here in August and September, and Reagancampaigned for his vice president earlier this month in SterlingHeights, not far from the tank facility.   Both Bush and Dukakis have played to Macomb's conservativeDemocrats by portraying themselves as defenders of family valuesand tough on crime, drugs and communism.   ``It's a patriotic area,'' Gilsenan said. ``People were flyingthe flag before it became popular again.''   The first wave of newcomers to Macomb County after World War IIwere mainly Catholics from Detroit who brought along theirDemocratic loyalties that were nurtured by President Roosevelt andthe trade unions.   ``The people who moved up into Macomb County in the 50s and 60scame of age in the 30s and 40s and saved up enough to buy a home inthe suburbs,'' said state Sen. Doug Carl of Utica, the county'sonly Republican in the state Legislature. ``But that was adifferent generation.''   Those older Democrats ``have retired to cottages up North, tomobile homes in Florida or died off,'' said Carl, who is runningagainst liberal Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., this year. ``Thosepeople are being supplanted by younger people ... concerned they'llbe able to pursue the same middle-class lifestyle as theirparents.''   Neel said Dukakis' centrist message could finally end localDemocrats' eight-year infatuation with Reagan.   In 1980, he said, ``Reagan hit it at the right time at the rightplace. If he'd run against a John F. Kennedy, a Lyndon Johnson, aHubert Humphrey, he would have got his clock cleaned.''</TEXT></DOC>
