The Washington-based telecommunications concern named Gerald H. Taylor, 45 years old, president of its Mid-Atlantic division, and Harold S. Trimmer, 48, president of its Pacific division. The divisions represent two of the company's most strategic geographic markets.    The Mid-Atlantic vacancy came about when H. Brian Thompson was named in February as executive vice president with responsibility for overseeing all seven of the company's regional divisions.    The position at the San Francisco-based Pacific division will open up with the departure today of Eugene Eidenberg, who became chief operating officer and a partner in Macrovision, a Torrance, Calif.-based company that is developing anti-copying technologies for video transmission.    MCI also named Thomas J. Wynne, 47, as president of its West division, a post previously held by Mr. Taylor.    Mr. Taylor, who joined MCI as one of its first employees in 1969, was tapped to run the big Mid-Atlantic division because of his broad experience in the company. He is a former marketing vice president and head of paging operations, which have since been sold.    When MCI created its regional units in 1985, Mr. Taylor took charge of the Denver-based West division, an operation Mr. Thompson described as a &quot;start up&quot; because MCI didn't have any offices there at the time. &quot;It grew very quickly under his leadership,&quot; Mr. Thompson said.    The Mid-Atlantic division, based in Arlington, Va., provides long-distance services for the federal government as well as other customers.    Mr. Thompson also said he expects Mr. Taylor to &quot;be a part of overall development&quot; at corporate headquarters.    Mr. Trimmer, a Harvard Law School graduate, has been vice president for government systems, overseeing sales and marketing efforts for federal and state-government customers. He also negotiated MCI's first agreement to provide international telephone service to Canada. Before joining MCI in 1982, he was a commissioner of the General Services Administration.    The Pacific division job is crucial to MCI because of the tough regulatory climate in California and the strength there of US Sprint Communications Co., the nation's third-largest long-distance company after American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCI. One analyst estimates California customers account for 34% of Sprint's annual revenue.    US Sprint is a venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc. Before the venture was formed, GTE's Sprint unit had its headquarters and an extensive network in California. MCI has historically been weak on the West Coast. </TEXT></DOC>
