The king on Sunday appeared to rule out the idea of Jordanrepresenting Palestinians in any peace talks and said his country'slinks to Palestinians in the occupied territories hamper theirfight against occupation.   Rumors swept Amman that further steps were possible _ perhapsreplacement of Palestinian members of his Cabinet.   Hussein already dissolved the lower house of Parliament, where30 of the 60 members represented the West Bank. He also canceled amajor West Bank development project.   But overly strong measures could shake the foundations of akingdom with a majority population of Palestinian refugees andimmigrants tied by blood and bank accounts to the West Bank andGaza Strip.   Hussein's moves stem from the Palestinian uprising on the WestBank and Gaza Strip, seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967Middle East War.   Protesters there clearly have demonstrated the PLO'soverwhelming popularity, and Jordan's relative lack of it.   The Arab summit in Algiers in June, which was called to back theuprising, placed political and financial control from the outsideclearly in the PLO's hands, upsetting some Jordanian officials whoargued the Arab leaders had ignored Jordan's historicresponsibilities to the region.   By stepping back, Hussein is honoring PLO requests. But he alsomay be seeking to force the PLO and Arab leaders to recognizeJordan's crucial role in the occupied lands, where mostPalestinians still carry Jordanian passports.   For Israel and its American supporters, it could mean that fornow, there is no viable alternative to dealing with the PLO if theywant peace.   Both have shunned the organization, claiming it is a terroristbody and _ more significantly _ fearing its demand for aPalestinian state on the flank of Israel.   Both have tried for two decades to force the Palestinians underJordan's wing and to talk peace with Jordan without the PLO.   But Hussein said in Algiers he would not negotiate with Israelover Palestine, repeating a warning he gave U.S. Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz in April.   That leaves Shultz's Middle East peace effort, keyed on Jordan,in limbo.   Jordan's move also challenges the PLO, which for more than twodecades has failed to win open recognition from either America orIsrael.   The PLO also must find ways to aid the occupied territories thatbypass Israeli security aimed specifically at halting PLO influence.   Hoping to encourage moderate Jordanian influence, Israel hadtacitly cooperated with Jordan's development plan prior to theuprising.   It also gave Jordanian Parliament members VIP treatment crossingthe usually arduous bridge security after Hussein revivedParliament in 1983 _ a move criticized at the time by the PLO.   The Parliament had been dormant since 1974, the year Arabs madethe PLO sole representative for Palestinians, in part because noelections could be held on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.   Jordan cannot afford to cut too deeply into its ties withPalestinians. They dominate Amman's economy and the remittancessent to Jordan by Palestinians in the gulf are its most importantsource of foreign exhange.   Most of the 800,000 West Bank residents still hold Jordanianpassports and about 18,000 still receive Jordanian salaries.   Jordanian money is still common currency. Jordanian texts areused in schools. Jordanian officials administer hundreds of mosquesand Islamic charities.   Until Israel choked traffic over the Jordan river bridges,thousands of Palestinians crossed weekly to visit family or friendsand handle bank accounts on either side of the line.   Hussein's great-grandfather is buried in Jerusalem.   Those close ties have made Jordan and the PLO natural rivals forPalestinian affections, creating distrust that flared into openwarfare in 1970.   Although Jordan accepted a 1974 Arab summit resolution declaringthe PLO the sole representative of the Palestinians, it continuedto insist it had responsibilities for them, and under internationallaw, sovereignty over the West Bank.   But the king's palace advisers appeared to be shocked by thestrength of anti-Jordanian sentiment expressed during the8-month-old Palestinian uprising. Jordanian backers were oftenharassed and threatened, sometimes attacked.   Jordanian officials also were knocked politically off balance bythe uprising-inspired wave of pro-PLO sentiment in the Arab worldfollowing Jordanian pressure on the PLO to meet American conditionsfor dealing with the organization _ effective recognition of Israel.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John Rice, currently visiting Baghdad, hascovered the Arab-Israeli conflict since 1984.
