Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Hezb-i-Islami insurgentgroup, said the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance was sending adelegation to Iran to try to persuade insurgents there toparticipate in the consultative council.   Because it has been delayed from Feb. 1 to Feb. 10, the meetingwill come just five days before the Soviet deadline for ending itsnine-year involvement in Afghanistan's bitter civil war.   The meeting is to be held near the Pakistani border town ofPeshawar.   Saeed said the dispute centers on the proportional repesentationof the mainly Sunni Moslem rebels based in Pakistan and the smaller,Shiite groups operating from Iran.   Four of eight Iran-based groups announced over the weekend theywould boycott the council meeting because too few seats wereallotted to them.   The Peshawar-based alliance labored over the weekend to choose420 representatives from its ranks _ 60 from each of the sevenparties.   Guerrilla leaders also assigned their Iran-based comrades 60seats despite their demand for 120 of the 480 seats.   ``They are not satisfied, but I think we can compromise,'' Saeedsaid.   Shiites comprise about 17 percent of Afghanistan's population,but make up about 40 percent of the Afghans who have fled theircountry since 1978, when a Marxist government seized power in amilitary coup.   Soviet forces intervened a year later to replace one Marxistgovernment with another, then remained to help it fight a growinginsurgency.   Of the estimated 15 million Afghans, one-third now live outsideAfghanistan _ 3 million in Pakistan and 2 million in Iran.   Guerrilla leaders have resolutely refused to include members ofthe Kabul government, whom they view as traitors, on the council,whose task is to choose a transitional government and approve atemporary head of state.   That government is to oversee the election of a 350-memberParliament through balloting over three months from Feb. 1 amongAfghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, and among Afghans living inrebel-controlled areas of their own country.   The Parliament, in turn, is to approve a new constitution andoversee a general election sometime within a year. The electionwould produce a permanent, post-war Afghan government.   The Soviets agreed under a U.N.-mediated accord to withdraw their100,000 troops by Feb. 15. Half left by Aug. 15, and the Sovietshave said they would honor the Feb. 15 deadline.   There is widespread fear of chaos if the fractious guerrillas donot agree on a political solution before the deadline.   ``If they don't get their act together, and fast, we may not seean end to the war,'' said a Western diplomat in Islamabad, speakingon condition of anonymity.   Some Western diplomats believe the Kabul regime will fall quicklyonce the Red Army is gone and the mainly-conscripted Afghan army isleft to face the rebels alone.   Others predict that a huge stockpile of Soviet arms andammunition left behind may enable the government to hold onto majorAfghan cities for months.</TEXT></DOC>
