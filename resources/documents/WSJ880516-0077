Estimates on the trade gap, due out tomorrow, call for a decline ranging from about $4 billion to just a few million, according to a poll by MMS International , a Redwood City, Calif., analysis firm. The median expectation is for a trade deficit of $12.5 billion, which would be an improvement from February's $13.83 billion gap -- a shocker that felled financial markets.    &quot;Anybody who's confident of his trade forecast is a fool,&quot; says James Solloway, director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. &quot;But I have my fingers crossed for a surprising improvement to about $10 billion,&quot; he adds.    March typically benefits from seasonal factors that boost U.S. exports. And imports of oil and autos are expected to be lower, further helping lighten the trade imbalance. Many economists believe that at the very least, the underlying trend continues to call for gradual improvement.    But even if the trade number improves, worry has been building that the economy can't maintain the current strong manufacturing, exporting and consuming pace without an outbreak of inflation.    The Federal Reserve has begun dosing the inflation problem with tighter credit, prompting several major banks to boost their prime lending rate to 9% from 8.5% last week.    The intent is to cool inflation by damping consumer demand, although many economists think more medicine is needed than the Fed has provided so far. Last week's surprisingly beefy revision to March retail sales only added to concern that consumer spending is even more vigorous than suspected.    The March increase in retail sales was revised to a 1.7% gain -- more than double last month's estimate. Many economists are averaging the March gain with April's 0.6% decline (as the important Easter season fell in March) and still coming up with a strong number.    But while the Fed apparently hopes to help curb consumers' appetites by raising interest rates, there's a growing debate on whether a mild nudging up of rates will do the job of curbing inflation if it really accelerates.    &quot;In a sense, the Fed was doing the right thing. Maybe they're being wimpy about it but they're doing the right thing&quot; as far as monetary policy remedies go, says Robert S. Gay, chief economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Many analysts think that if inflation continues to rise, the Fed will keep hammering it with higher rates, possibly pushing the economy into recession down the road.    &quot;My feeling is that this is the beginning of the end on rates, but the end is a lot further away than most people think,&quot; he adds.    More data on the pace of inflation are due this week, with April reports on industrial production, capacity utilization and consumer prices.    Economists at Boston Co. expect a big jump in industrial output, due out tomorrow, mainly because of higher production of autos and capital goods. The consensus view calls for a rise of 0.6%, which would follow March's 0.1% increase.    Pushed along by higher production, capacity utilization probably also jumped sharply and is at the straining point in some industries. The April utilization rate, due out Wednesday, is expected to increase to 82.6% from March's 82.3%, according to the consensus view.    One of the more direct readings on inflation will come in Friday's report on consumer prices, which are expected, not surprisingly, to be higher. Analysts expect an increase of about 0.4% in the April consumer price index, on the heels of a 0.5% jump the previous month. The price increases are expected pretty much across the board as commodities and services are rising at about a 4% annual rate.    April housing starts, due out Wednesday, are expected to hold their own or rise a bit. Housing starts rose 1.9% in March and 9.6% in February for a little rebound, but they're expected to be sharply lower for the whole year.    The jump in interest rates could spur home buyers to try to beat any successive boosts, says Mark Lasky, an economist at Data Resources Inc. That sort of race against rates occurred last fall, when interest rates climbed, he notes. But eventually, higher rates only hurt housing.    ---                   The Economy in Numbers            Statistics Released in the Past Week                                               Change                                               (from prior                                  Total        period)    Money supply      M1 Week ended May 2      (in billions)               $776.4       -$1.5      M2 Week ended May 2      (in trillions)              $2.9974      +$.001      M3 Week ended May 2      (in trillions)              $3.7688      +$.005    Retail sales      April (in billions)         $131.58      -0.6%    New jobless claims      Week ended April 30         295,000      -6.3%    Producer price Index      April                       106.9%       +0.4%    Business Inventories      March (in billions)         $719.97      +0.3%    Auto sales      Early May                   204,270      +35.2%    Sindlinger consumer    confidence percent      Three-day period      (May 10-11-12)              65.5         -0.1%              Statistics to Be Released This Week    Building permits (Wed.)
