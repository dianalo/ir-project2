North to try to undercut defense arguments thatgovernment secrets must be disclosed to guarantee the former WhiteHouse aide a fair trial.   Responding to President Reagan's refusal to release virtually anyof the secret documents North wants to disclose at trial,independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh conceded that some of theoperations financed by the U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds were legal.   The prosecutor said he wouldn't contest the legality of spendingsome of the proceeds from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help drugagents locate American hostages in Lebanon, purchase a Danish shipfor clandestine operations, buy radios for a foreign political groupand pay Nicaraguan rebel leaders.   ``The government is willing to concede, for the purposes of thiscase, that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwiselawful'' but not authorized as part of Reagan's attempt to freehostages by selling arms to Iran, Walsh said in a pleading releasedlate Tuesday in federal court.   Walsh, however, maintained that there was still sufficientevidence to prove that North conspired with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Richard V. Secord andAlbert Hakim to defraud the government.   The central conspiracy and theft-of-government property chargesagainst the former National Security Council aide and hisco-defendants, who are to be tried separately, stems from thediversion of more than $14 million in arms-sale profits to theNicaraguan rebels, known as the Contras.   North's ``deceitful acquisition'' of $18 million in profits fromthe U.S.-Iran arms sales is ``the critical element of North'sbehavior that makes it criminal,'' Walsh said.   Instead of turning over the money to the U.S. government, Northplaced it in secret Swiss bank accounts along with funds raised fromforeign countries and from private donors through a tax-exemptfoundation.   ``Whether he used the diverted funds for ends that the governmentcould otherwise legitimately fund is irrelevant,'' the independentprosecutor said. ``North's crime lies in how he acquired andmaintained control of these funds, not in the specific purposes forwhich he spent them.''   By conceding that some covert operations directed by North werelegal, particularly the Drug Enforcement Administration's efforts tofree American hostages in Lebanon, Walsh apparently hopes toforeclose defense use of classified documents.   The Reagan administration is particularly unwilling to divulgeany information that might compromise efforts to release thehostages. Disclosure of such material could jeopardize the lives ofthe hostages or subject them and others to torture, Walsh warnedearlier this year.   The pleadings were filed at the request of U.S. District JudgeGerhard A. Gesell, who is conducting secret hearings on North'sobjections to deleting classified material from 395 documents Walshwants to use as trial exhibits.   Gesell must decide whether any of the secrets North wants to useare relevant to his defense. If so, the Classified InformationProcedures Act provides for the dismissal of charges if thegovernment's refusal to release certain material prevents adefendant from getting a fair trial.   In addition to objecting to censoring prosecution exhibits, Northwants to disclose an additional 40,000 pages of secret documents.   Walsh contended that North's use of classified documents ``todemonstrate the bona fides of the programs supported by certain ofthe proceeds of the Iranian arms sales is unjustified in light ofthe government's theory of the case.''   A separate pleading disclosed that prosecutors would rely heavilyon evidence that North personally supervised establishment of theclandestine network to arm the Contras, ``in a way calculated todefeat legal restrictions'' on such aid imposed by Congress.   Walsh said there was evidence that by the summer of 1986, thesecret resupply operation employed 20 full-time employees and had amonthly payroll of $60,000.   Prosecutors have records showing that North spoke by telephonewith former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez more than 100 times betweenAugust 1985 and November 1986 to direct a resupply operation, Walshsaid.   Fernandez, identified as an unindicted co-conspirator, used aKL-43 encryption device outside of normal CIA secure channels tosend messages to North about establishment of an airstrip in CostaRica for the resupply operation.   Separate criminal charges against Fernandez, the CIA's stationchief in Costa Rica, were dismissed Oct. 19 following ajurisdictional dispute. Walsh has indicated he will seek to obtain anew indictment against Fernandez from a federal grand jury inVirginia, which the defense contends is the only proper place to trythe case.</TEXT></DOC>
