Effective number andpair-creation operators are evaluated up to second-order in the amplitudesof the pair rotation or vibration. The number equation and the self-consistencycondition are extended to the same order accordingly, while the effectiveHamiltonian is calculated up to third-order. Physical interpretationof the results becomes easy if renormalized collective parameters areused. Decoupling of the pair rotation and the pair vibration is shownto persist in the higher-order approximation.</TEXT></DOC>
