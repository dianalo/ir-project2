In a speech Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III alsodemanded an end to further settlement of Jews on the land taken byIsrael in the Six-Day War of 1967.   The speech followed statements by President Bush last monthruling out Israeli sovereignty over the territories.   Baker mixed in demands that the Arabs accept Israel, end theireconomic boycott of the Jewish state and repudiate the 1975 U.N.General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism.   Baker called for ``full recognition of Israel as a neighbor andpartner in trade and human contact.''   He also advised the Palestinians to abandon the ``illusion'' ofcontrolling all of Palestine. Baker's reference was to Israeliterritory apart from the West Bank and Gaza.   The West Bank and Gaza, which Jordan and Egypt lost to Israel inthe Six-Day War, are predominantly Arab. But since Israel tookcontrol Jews have been establishing settlements there.   Baker urged Israel to ``stop settlement activity,'' whichapparently would rule out expanding current Jewish settlements aswell as starting new ones. And his demand to ``forswearannexation'' would rule out incorporating any of the territory intoIsrael.   ``The United States does not support annexation or permanentIsraeli control of the West Bank and Gaza, nor do we support thecreation of an independent Palestinian state,'' Baker said.   The speech was delivered to the American Israel Public AffairsCommittee, a private research and lobbying group, just before Bakermet at the State Department with Israeli Defense Minister YitzhakRabin.   Rabin said his meeting with Baker concentrated on trying toimplement Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for elections toselect Palestinian leaders to negotiate self-rule on the West Bankand in Gaza.   Today, Shamir rejected Baker's criticism of Israel's policy ofcontinuing to support new Jewish settlements in the occupied lands,including Baker's statement that ``Now is the time to lay aside,once and for all, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''   Shamir, interviewed by Israel radio, said, ``I don't know howanyone could speak at all of a large Israel. Israel is a very smallcountry and all of us know that its territory is very limited. Itreally rings ironic to speak of Israel as big.''   Shamir, who was on a visit to London, said, ``It is clear thereare differences of opinion between us and that isn't new. I don'tsee any link between settlements and the subject of the peaceprocess.''   Rabin said he had not read Baker's speech. But later, he toldIsraeli reporters he wished Baker had directed more of the speechto the Palestinians.   Today, Rabin meets with members of Congress and attends a dinnerat Blair House hosted by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He seesBush on Wednesday.   Baker's approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict is different frompast U.S. administrations in that he has not put forward a U.S.plan for negotiations or settlement.   Instead, Baker has given lukewarm support to Shamir's proposalfor elections to be followed by negotiations on an overallsettlement.   ``Neither the United States nor any other party, inside oroutside, can or will dictate an outcome,'' he said.   However, Baker added: ``We do have an idea about the reasonablemiddle ground to which a settlement should be directed.'' And hewent on to state the administration's position on severalcontroversial issues.   ``Now is the time to lay aside, once and for all, theunrealistic vision of a greater Israel,'' he said.   Baker also called for the reopening of schools in the occupiedterritories. Shamir said later that schools were open in Gaza.   An American Jewish leader, Seymour D. Reich, said that in hisjudgment Israel would have few problems taking Baker's advice.   ``Annexation of the territories is nowhere in Israel's presentplans, so far as I understand,'' said Reich, chairman of theConference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.   And, Reich said in a statement: ``Israel would be more thaneager and follow Mr. Baker's suggestion to open the schoolsprovided they are used as educational institutions and not as astaging area for the intefadeh (uprising).''   At the same time, Reich said Baker deserved praise for callingon the Palestinians to abandon violence and to reach out to Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
