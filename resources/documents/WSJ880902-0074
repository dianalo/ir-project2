The decline, the first drop in productivity since 1986, followed a solid increase of 3.6% in the first quarter. Productivity -- the measure of output for each hour worked -- usually increases at the start of a business recovery and tapers off as the recovery reaches its later stages. The current economic expansion, which is more than 5 1/2 years old, is the U.S.'s longest peacetime expansion.    The productivity report also included signs that inflationary pressures are mounting. Unit labor costs increased at a revised 5.7% annual rate, compared with a 0.1% rate of increase in the first quarter. Previously, the department estimated that the second-quarter rise was at a 5.9% clip.    David Berson, economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, said that although unit labor costs were revised slightly downward, wages still were increasing too quickly. &quot;If this continues, manufacturers are going to pass this higher cost down to consumers,&quot; he said.    Separately, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.2% in July, boosted by spending on government projects and on office and apartment construction. The July increase, however, was offset by a substantial June revision. The new estimate was that spending declined 1.5% in June, while the department initially said it had increased 0.1%.    The small upward revision in the department's estimate of second-quarter productivity resulted from an increase in its calculation of output, the department said. Non-farm output rose at a revised 5.2% annual rate compared with an initial estimate of 4.7%. Hours worked were revised slightly to show a rise at a 6.6% annual rate compared with the 6.5% pace reported earlier.    Similarly, economists noted that the upward revision reflected a small upward adjustment last month in the government's estimate of second-quarter gross national product. In the GNP report, the Commerce Department estimated that second-quarter economic growth was at an annual rate of 3.3%, up from an initial estimate of 3.1%.    Manufacturing productivity rose at a revised 3.6% annual pace, up slightly from the initial report of 3.5%. Manufacturing output increased at a revised 5.7% annual pace, compared with the 5.4% rate reported previously. Hours worked in manufacturing were revised upward to a 2% annual rate of increase from 1.8%. Manufacturing unit labor costs, which weren't revised, declined at a 0.6% rate.    The department also reported a preliminary estimate that productivity of non-financial corporations increased at a 0.4% annual pace. In the first quarter, productivity in that sector grew at a 4.3% pace. Non-financial corporations account for almost 60% of the nation's output.    The Commerce Department's report showed that the value of new construction put in place rose to a $401 billion annual rate in July. This followed a revised June rate of $396.2 billion, previously reported as $402.8 billion. The July pace was 0.5% higher than a year earlier.    The July increase reflects a 3.8% rise in government construction projects and a 2.9% boost in office building construction.    These increases, however, were offset by declines in single-family housing, factories and shopping centers. The decline in single-family housing reflects higher interest rates in recent months, economists said. Despite the decline, however, overall residential construction rose 0.5% in July.    Factory construction fell 0.7% in July, the second consecutive monthly decline. However, Mr. Berson said he expects an increase in this sector in the next few months, as U.S. corporations continue their capital spending boom. &quot;So far, businesses have been spending on equipment, but they are going to have to improve and expand their factories soon too,&quot; he said.    After adjusting for inflation, construction spending rose 0.7% in July, but was down 1% from July 1987.    The figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Here are the Commerce Department's figures for construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally adjusted annual rates.
