Death row inmate David Ray Harris, called as a witness in Adams'hearing to ask for a new trial, said he was alone in a car stoppedby Officer Robert Wood, who was killed in the incident Nov. 28,1976. Harris acknowledged his finger was on the trigger when Woodwas shot, but stopped short of saying he killed the officer.   Based on Harris' testimony, State District Judge Larry Barakasaid he would determine that Harris had admitted to the killing.   ``As far as the court is concerned, he is telling me that hedid,'' Baraka said. But the judge did not decide immediately onAdams' request.   Adams was convicted of killing Wood and sentenced to death, butthe sentence later was commuted to life in prison. He has maintainedhis innocence, and his conviction was questioned in the Errol Morrismovie ``The Thin Blue Line.''   Harris testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution whenhe first implicated Adams. Harris said prosecutor Doug Mulder hadpromised ``to take care of'' other criminal charges pending againsthim in return for his testimony.   ``Did Randall Adams kill Robert Wood?'' attorney Randy Schafferasked Harris, who was wearing an orange jail uniform, handcuffs andshackles.   ``No, he did not,'' Harris replied. ``Randall Adams knew nothingabout this offense and was not in the car at the time.'' Harris hadinitially said he and Adams were both in the car when it was stoppedby Wood.   Harris said that after he testified at the 1977 trial that hecrouched in the car as Adams shot Wood, he was not prosecuted in hisother pending cases and did not have to continue reporting to hisprobation officer.   A recommendation by Baraka for a new trial would go to the TexasCourt of Criminal Appeals, which may act on it. The hearing isexpected to take several days.   Harris is on death row for a 1986 conviction for murdering aBeaumont man whose home he broke into in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
