The satellite was launched at 9:40 a.m. form the Baikonurspaceport, said Nikolai Semyonov, an official in the internationalliaison office of the Glavkosmos space agency.   He said the launch was the first on commercial terms with aforeign country or company, adding that negotiations were under wayfor similar deals although no contracts have been signed yet.   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced thesuccessful launch to a cheering Parliament. He called it ``a majormilestone'' in India's space program and said India was the fifthnation to have a remote sensing satellite. The others are TheUnited States, Soviet Union, France and Japan.   The satellite, called IRS, will operate for three years studyingIndia's forests, water resources and mineral deposits using remotesensing devices, Radio Moscow said.   The Soviets created Glavkosmos in January 1986 to seek foreigncustomers for its launching services.   Commercial satellite launching is also offered by the UnitedStates, China and the European consortium Ariane. But the U.S.space shuttle, meant to be the workhorse for satellite launches, isstill grounded because of the January 1986 explosion of SpaceShuttle Challenger. The Ariane program also has suffered setbacks.   The Soviets sent the first satellite into space, in 1957, andhave the advantage of the most experience in satellite launching,sending aloft more spacecraft than any other country. The Soviets'powerful booster rockets can also put into orbit heavier payloadsthan their Western competitors.   Yuri N. Salekov, deputy director of Licensintorg, which workswith Glavkosmos and other Soviet foreign trade organizations,declined to say how much the launching cost on the grounds it is a``commercial secret.''   Semyonov, in a telephone interview, said IRS was launched aboarda Vostok rocket booster and that the satellite reached orbitwithout problem.   The flight was controlled by a Soviet monitoring station nearMoscow and the Indian space control center in Bangolore, Tass said.   Glavkosmos officials repeatedly complain that their efforts toseek Western buyers for Soviet satellite-launching services areseverely hampered by Western governments' restrictions on the flowof technology. The United States and other countries fear theSoviets will steal Western technology used in satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
