This necessitates a diagonalizationapproach instead of solutions of differential equations. Correction overFermi-Breit form appears to be significant. For heavy quark systems agreementwith experiment is found. The method will be quite useful if the quark-antiquarkdynamics becomes sufficiently known. 5 tables, 32 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
