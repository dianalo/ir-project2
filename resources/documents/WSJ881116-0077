The plan would use borrowings of as much as $75 million to buy as many as 1.5 million newly issued and treasury shares. Yesterday, Northern shares closed at $44.50 each, up 87.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading.    In part to offset the issuance of those shares, Northern said its board also authorized the purchase of as many as one million of its common shares on the open market during the next two years.    The employee stock plan will replace a company-funded investment plan. </TEXT></DOC>
