Now, newspaper publishersare looking for ways to make sure Johnny and his fellowstudents learn to read newspapers.   As they assemble in Vancouver, British Columbia, today fortheir annual meeting, members of the American NewspaperPublishers Association are confronted with a discouragingdecline in the steadfast newspaper-reading habits of pastgenerations. While some papers are wooing older readers,aging baby boomers who aren't regular newspaper readers noware more widely considered lost causes. So publishers havemoved on to the next generation: elementary and high schoolstudents and young adults.</LP><TEXT>   Newspapers of varying sizes have put some of their bestyoung editors on the case of creating new sections and pagesfor captivating younger readers. While publishers in the pastyear have slashed staff and space for news stories, they arededicating larger budgets and staffs to create pages foryounger readers.   Some of the attempts are a mix of editorial innovation andlightweight entertainment. At Tribune Co.'s Chicago Tribune,a panel of five teen-age film reviewers appears each Fridaywith the picks and pans of Hollywood movies, even those rated&quot;R.&quot; Times Mirror Co.'s Newsday started a &quot;Student BriefingPage,&quot; to explain the Persian Gulf war, that has now become astandard feature on a variety of topics.   Dow Jones andamp; Co.'s Wall Street Journal will start a special&quot;Classroom Edition&quot; in September for high schoolers.   Advance Publications Inc.'s Syracuse Herald-Journal does aweekly magazine for teens, called &quot;hj,&quot; that tackles grittysocial and sexual issues, runs a police blotter of crimes inlocal high schools, and features restaurant reviews bystudents (who recently passed judgment on a new food court ata Syracuse mall).   News executives have long given lip service to thereadership problem. But efforts to recruit new readers werestepped up sharply after the 1989 ANPA meeting in Chicago,when particularly bleak projections were made about erodingnewspaper audiences.   &quot;It dawned on us that if we don't start luring teen-agersinto the paper and start them reading us now, they may notsubscribe in the future,&quot; says Grant Podelco, arts editor ofthe Herald Journal, who also oversees the &quot;hj&quot; magazine,which was started in the fall of 1989. &quot;It's only the logicalthing to do.&quot;   Attempts to make readers out of a video generationprobably should have started years ago. Total circulation ofdaily newspapers in the U.S. is holding steady at about 63million, but the number of adults who read a paper every dayhas been tumbling. A recent study by the NewspaperAdvertising Bureau on circulation and readership shows thatdaily newspaper readership among adults aged 18 to 24 fell to53% in 1990 from 73% in 1970; for adults aged 25 to 34, thedrop was to 58% in 1990 from 77% in 1970.   More disturbing, however, was what Albert Gollin, thebureau's chief researcher, found in the numbers: A&quot;generational shift&quot; in readership was afoot. Traditionally,as people passed 30, got married, had children and took onmortgages, they became daily readers of newspapers.   However, the over-30 reader is not so reliable now. Thereport shows the percentage of adults, aged 30 to 44, readinga newspaper every day in 1972 was close to 75%; by 1989, thepercentage in that age group reading every day had slipped tonearly 45%. Some good news: Since 1989, adults under 60 haveregistered a &quot;nice uplift&quot; in everyday readership of anaverage 3%. But researchers caution that this isn'tnecessarily the end of the slide.   &quot;The marriage and mortgages hypothesis no longer works,&quot;Mr. Gollin says. &quot;Publishers have to strengthen readershipamong young people. Once formed in their 20s, and almostcertainly by the age of 30, adults' newspaper-reading habitstend to persist.&quot;   Television is often blamed as the culprit behind kids'slack reading habits. But researchers and news executives sayit has as much to do with the disappearing &quot;family hour,&quot; atime when kids and parents were likely to read the paper.&quot;That time has been lost to working moms, aerobic classes,and of course TV,&quot; says Jean Gaddy Wilson, executive directorof New Directions for News, an independent research grouphoused at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.&quot;Many kids today don't even see a paper at home these days.At best, a paper is in a mix of entertainment and newsmedia.&quot;   As an attempt to build quasi-family bonds with youngreaders, publishers are looking to the classroom. Papers haveoften discounted subscriptions for classroom use, but someare creating special editions just for schools. The WallStreet Journal's color-tabloid &quot;Classroom Edition&quot; willfeature articles drawn from the Journal and will include amonthly teacher's guide, video supplements andSpanish-language translations of selected stories.   Most editions aimed at the young are part of, or insertsin, the main newspaper. Newsday, based on Long Island, N.Y.,had a strong student response to its &quot;Student Briefing Pageon the News,&quot; about 3,000 letters in 10 weeks. BillZimmerman, Newsday deputy business editor and in charge ofthe page, says he used &quot;interactive&quot; features to hookstudents. One feature called &quot;Make Beliefs&quot; used a cartoon ofPresident Bush and Saddam Hussein, and asked students towrite in a fictional conversation the two would have if theymet in the school cafeteria.   In Syracuse, meanwhile, &quot;hj&quot; has carried cover stories onteens' obsession with death, anorexia among teen-agers andhomosexual teens. The Herald-Journal's Mr. Podelco oversees astaff of two full-time editors, a photographer and about 30student correspondents.   Each issue includes &quot;Face,&quot; a photograph and quickiequestion and answer with a local teen, and the &quot;Police Beat&quot;list of school-related crimes. In April, &quot;hj&quot; did its ownswimsuit issue, giving $50 to four teens and sending them outto find the &quot;hip, hot&quot; swimsuits.   The ultimate goal is to bring the teen readers into thepaper on days when the magazine doesn't appear. Mr. Podelcosays features from &quot;hj&quot; are being mixed into Saturday andMonday editions of the Herald-Journal, on pages bearing the&quot;hj&quot; logo. &quot;We even come across some stories in the schoolsthat end up on page one.&quot;   The much larger-circulation Chicago Tribune last yearstarted &quot;Preps Plus,&quot; a special sports section covering highschool and community sports. The paper includes a fashionpage on Fridays aimed at young people, and each day runs a&quot;Young Reader's Guide,&quot; an index running on page two of newsand features that might appeal to younger readers.   The Tribune also uses teen movie reviewers as a lure. Andit doesn't expect them to go easy. Writing about ColumbiaPictures' &quot;Mortal Thoughts,&quot; Vincent Schleitwiler of Math andScience Academy, said: &quot;I can't really say I hated `MortalThoughts.' I'm just sick of mediocre movies that waste mytime.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
