(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former pro football player wasindicted Wednesday on charges of murdering a man 31 years ago in acase reopened at the request of the victim's mother.   Bobby Hoppe, 53, was released on $7,500 bail Wednesday in the1957 slaying of Teddy Donald Hudson. The 24-year-old Hudson waskilled by a shotgun blast fired into his car as he drove down aneighborhood street, police said.   The charges against Hoppe, a former Washington Redskins playerwho is now athletic director at Chattanooga State TechnicalCommunity College, came 14 months after police reopened the case atthe request of Georgia Hudson.   Police would not say what led them to arrest Hoppe, who had beena suspect during the original investigation, and gave no motive forthe slaying.   Police initially thought the death might be liquor-related,since in 1953 Hudson was sentenced to prison on a liquor convictionand was a reputed whiskey runner.   In addition, allegations were made during the originalinvestigation that Hoppe shot Hudson over Hoppe's sister, whomHudson was dating, but there wasn't enough evidence for an arrest,said police spokesman Freeman Cooper.   Hoppe declined to talk about the case. His lawyer, LeroyPhillips, said only that he is convinced of Hoppe's innocence.   At the time of the slaying, Hoppe was a starting running back atAuburn University, then called Alabama Polytechnic Institute. Hewas on the team that won the 1957 national championship.   After playing briefly for the Redskins, Hoppe was a teacher,coach and administrator at several high schools in Chattanooga andin Georgia.   Mrs. Hudson asked police to reopen the case after a meeting ofFamilies and Friends of Murder Victims, a support and counselinggroup. The case was taken up by two detectives on a newly-formedtask force on long-unsolved murders.   Hoppe will be tried under state law as it existed in 1957, whichmeans that he could receive 20 years to life in prison. Current lawallows the death penalty.</TEXT></DOC>
