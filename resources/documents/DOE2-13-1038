The Pilot Plant, a cooperative project of theUS Department of Energy and utility firms led by the Southern CaliforniaEdison Company, began a three year period of power production operationin August 1984. During this period, plant performance indicators, suchas capacity factor, system efficiency, and availability, were studiedto assess the operational capability of the Pilot Plant to reliably supplyelectrical power. Also studied was the long-term performance of suchkey plant components as the heliostats and the receiver. During the threeyears of power production, the Pilot Plant showed an improvement in performance.Considerable increases in capacity factor, system efficiency, and availabilitywere achieved. Heliostat operation was reliable, and only small amountsof mirror corrosion were observed. Receiver tube leaks did occur, however,and were the main cause of the plant's unscheduled outages. The PilotPlant provided valuable lessons which will aid in the design of futuresolar central receiver plants. 53 refs., 46 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
