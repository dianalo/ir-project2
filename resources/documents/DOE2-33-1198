The data of chemical analysis show, that uranium, zirconium,tungstate content corresponds to Na/sub 2/UO/sub 2/(WO/sub 4/)/sub 2/(1) and Na/sub 2/Zr(WO/sub 4/)/sub 3/ (2) formulae. Their X-ray diffractionand infrared spectroscopic characteristics, thermal stability and solubilityin chloride-tungstate melts of variable composition were studied. Solubilityof (1) increases regularly with temperature growth in Na/sub 2/WO/sub4/ - NaCl system in 973-1073 K range and with growth of Na/sub 2/WO/sub4/ concentration. Solubility of (2) in NaCl-KCl melt increases slightlywith temperature growth. Calculated melting heat of (1) and (2) was equalto 40+-10 and 55+-10 kJ/mol respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
