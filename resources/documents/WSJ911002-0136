Then came 36,000 pages of documents and100 witnesses without even an appearance of an appearance ofan impropriety. When his record of service in every branch ofgovernment and his easy style won him wide support in thecountry, his opponents on the Senate Judiciary Committeecaricatured his views on affirmative action, abortion,separation of powers and economic liberties. When JudgeThomas explained what his views actually were, liberalsenators went back to opposing conservatism.   Judge Thomas is no more conservative than Justices Scalia,Kennedy or Souter, so we're back to the fact that he's ablack conservative. &quot;Can you imagine liberals talking aboutfilibustering the nomination of the second black to theSupreme Court of the United States?&quot; Sen. Orrin Hatch asked.&quot;Shame.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   If this assessment of the split Judiciary Committee voteseems harsh, consider the are-you-joking? reasons senatorsgave for voting against Judge Thomas.   Sen. Joe Biden said he couldn't vote for Robert Borkbecause he had a legal agenda. &quot;I believe Judge Thomas doesnot now have an agenda,&quot; Mr. Biden said, but now this is areason to vote no. &quot;I cannot gamble on what will happen oncehe arrives at the court.&quot; Mr. Biden opposed Mr. Bork becausehe didn't invoke natural rights; he now opposes Judge Thomasbecause he might.   Then there were the new litmus tests. &quot;The JudiciaryCommittee cannot force a nominee to answer any question,&quot; Mr.Biden said, &quot;but I'm not obliged to vote for the confirmationof a nominee who fails to do so either.&quot; Antonin Scalia, whorefused even to answer whether he agreed with Marbury v.Madison, which established judicial review in 1803, wasapproved by the Senate, 98-0.   Call it a for-Thomas-only Catch-22, with Howard Metzenbaumdemanding that Judge Thomas pledge to uphold abortion, PaulSimon insisting on a promise that quotas are OK. If JudgeThomas had answered these or a dozen more similar questions,he would have shown the same disdain for judicialindependence that senators show when they ask. Answeringwould disqualify a nominee for the job.   Sen. Ted Kennedy added to the circus with the comment, &quot;Ifsenators buy the view that Judge Thomas as a member of theSupreme Court will approach Roe v. Wade with an open mind,there's a bridge in Brooklyn they might also like to buy.&quot;Others might think this is another bridge too far for Mr.Kennedy. He has in effect accused Judge Thomas of perjury. Bythe way, Mr. Kennedy too announced a new litmus for nominees:&quot;Few of us in the Congress&quot; want a Supreme Court decision&quot;reading a line-item veto for the president into theConstitution.&quot;   Several senators even informed Mr. Bush whom he cannominate safely. Mr. Biden said that Barry Goldwater or aliberal would do. &quot;The majority of Republican presidents inthis century,&quot; Mr. Simon claimed, &quot;have nominated one SupremeCourt justice with significantly different views from thepresident.&quot; The liberal Prof. Laurence Tribe would no doubtsatisfy Mr. Simon.   The Judiciary Committee bequeathed little but high humorto the full Senate, which will vote this week-unless theDemocratic leadership delays the vote. Thurgood Marshall'sofficial resignation yesterday is a sign (hint?) it's time tovote.   &quot;We have a very disturbing ritual,&quot; Sen. Alan Simpson, theWyoming Republican said of the committee's post-Bork role.&quot;It has become a charade, a caricature, a cartoon and we'reall in it.&quot; This starts with &quot;the staff cranking out triviaquestions by the metric ton,&quot; he said, then &quot;cameras grind,the recorders whir, the lights flash, the scriveners write,and we put on the show. We perform. We do it, I do it, thegroups do it.&quot; It's a Beltway blowout, &quot;all of this guided bysome of the zealots downtown who need to fill their coffersfrom time to time by injections of high drama of plain,unvarnished distortion.&quot;   Beneath this self-parody of divided government is supposedto be the nobility of the law. It's been 24 years since aDemocratic president nominated a justice, but does politicalfrustration justify trying to force nominees to swear howthey will rule in cases? Or trying to coerce a president intonominating people who've never uttered an interestingthought?   There are serious issues here. The legal system is inchaos on several fronts, none of which have much to do withthe questions the senators asked Judge Thomas. For mostAmericans, the legal issue is crime. This is also the area ofthe law where the radical changes made by liberal activistjudges over the past 30 years remain almost wholly intact.   Last week, as senators quibbled over where a right tocontraception might be found in the Constitution -- as ifstates were about to outlaw the condoms public schools nowfreely distribute -- a federal judge blocked another attemptto return order to the streets. San Francisco has become sounruly that the police occasionally enforce a century-oldordinance against begging by targeting aggressive andintimidating panhandlers. They arrested one Celestus Blairfive times, at which point Mr. Blair's ACLU lawyers demandedpunitive damages against the city and the officers whoarrested him. Judge William Orrick upheld the lawsuit as aFirst Amendment right.   &quot;Begging gives the speaker an opportunity to spread hisviews and ideas on, among other things, the way our societytreats its poor and disenfranchised,&quot; Judge Orrick ruled.Arguments about annoyance to the public are &quot;hardlycompelling,&quot; he ruled, disagreeing with a federal appealscourt ruling that upheld a law against begging on New YorkCity subways.   Judge Orrick's views troubled the liberal San FranciscoChronicle. &quot;Aggressive and coercive panhandling constitutes afestering cancer on our city's streets,&quot; an editorial said,&quot;and must not be allowed free rein.&quot; One problem might bethat federal trial judges in San Francisco get undergroundparking at the office so they don't need to walk the streets,but don't blame Judge Orrick alone.   It's now 20 years since the Supreme Court ridiculed as&quot;too extravagant to deserve extended treatment&quot; the idea thatdepriving the police of the power to arrest menacing vagrantsmight lead to more crime. Other issues that need high-courtreview: Do high school student-drug dealers have aconstitutional right to carry beepers? Can Detroit haveall-male public schools? Do apparently psychotic homeless menhave a constitutional right to go to public libraries toharass women?   Judge Thomas might have some interesting views on howcrimes petty and large have stripped residents of urbanneighborhoods of civil liberties such as walking the streetsunhindered. This may be a petty concern to the solons of theSenate Judiciary Committee, but it's another reason JusticeThomas should be on the bench when the new Supreme Court termbegins on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
