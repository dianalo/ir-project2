For Western nations this raises a question:Is the cartel still a menace or only a harmless bogeyman?   Less than a decade ago, oil-importing countries saw OPEC as thedevil, a dastardly outfit bent on carrying out economic terrorismagainst the West.   Some still do. But gradually the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries appears to be shedding its bad guy image.   Evidence was the meeting this week between OPEC and sevenindependent oil-producing nations to discuss joint cuts in oilexports as a way of boosting prices.   The outsiders are not part of the Western club of rich nations.They include partly industrialized Mexico, Communist China, MarxistAngola, two Arab countries and some relative newcomers tooil-exporting status.   Yet OPEC seems to have become more palatable even to some richercountries.   Norway over the past year has established close ties to thecartel, and in 1987 the European Economic Community, comprised ofBritain, France, West Germany and nine other European nations, heldan initial ``seminar'' with OPEC representatives to exchange views.   The seven non-OPEC countries did not come to Vienna because of anew-found fondness for OPEC or a desire to become members. Theysimply are so troubled by volatile oil prices that they will trynearly anything to stabilize the market.   Before the startling oil-price spirals of the 1970s beganunwinding six years ago, any formal deals between OPEC and otheroil producers would have seemed preposterous.   For one thing, OPEC wasn't interested. As recently as 1978 itcontrolled two-thirds of the non-Communist world's oil supplies.Prices were high and most people thought they'd go much higher. Oilat $100 a barrel seemed a good bet for the late 1980s.   Then came the oil glut of the early 1980s. OPEC's fortunes tooka sharp turn as new oil-exporting powers such as Britain and Mexicobegan undercutting OPEC prices and boosting their sales.   Now the non-OPEC oil producers pump about 28 million barrels aday while OPEC's output has dropped to 17.5 million barrels a dayfrom its 1978 peak of about 31 million barrels daily.   OPEC has come to the conclusion that this trend must notcontinue. So it has moderated its goals, saying it only wants tokeep oil prices at a ``reasonable'' level, and that alloil-producing countries must help achieve this.   ``OPEC is not against anybody,'' says Arturo Hernandez Grisanti,the oil minister of Venezuela, which was one of five foundingmembers of the organization in 1960.   ``OPEC is trying to stabilize the oil market, and this stabilityis in the interests of everybody, including consumers,'' he toldreporters this week in Vienna.   The message seems to be working. OPEC contacts with non-OPECcountries, particularly in the Third World, are now commonplace.   Although they had no direct role in this week's OPEC meetings,the state of Texas and the Canadian province of Alberta sentofficials to Vienna to consult privately with key OPECrepresentatives.   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission thatregulates the state's oil industry, says the United States hasnothing to fear from OPEC and should establish close ties to thecartel.   ``Right now OPEC is not in the position to do something thatwould be harmful to us,'' he said in an interview.   The Reagan administration refuses to deal openly with OPEC. Itmaintains that governments should not interfere in the setting ofoil prices or production rates.   This also is the official policy of the International EnergyAgency, a Paris-based body representing the United States and 20other Western industrialized nations. The agency was set up afterthe 1973 Arab oil embargo against the United States, an event thatpropelled OPEC to instant status as an oil power.   Part of OPEC's image problem is linked to the makeup of thegroup. Some countries with close bilateral ties to the UnitedStates, such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, say they honestly wantto avoid a repeat of the 1970s oil price shocks because it wouldonly mean another cycle of boom and bust in their countries.   But other members, mainly Iran and Libya, have not abandoned theaim of driving prices high quickly and getting the most out of aresource the West can't do without.   In recent years the Saudi view has prevailed. But in much of theWest, doubts persist about whether OPEC would stick to its moderatepricing stance if the world supply glut ended and OPEC regained theleverage to send prices skyrocketing.</TEXT></DOC>
