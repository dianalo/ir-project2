 The Denver office would return a printout of thedata to the scientist for an error/edit check to validate the information.andM;&quot;One of our biggest problems here in the bureau is we have a lot of mandatesand priorities and a shortage of people to carry those out.andP;  So we're alwaysunder the gun in terms of not only gathering data but analyzing it andinterpreting it,&quot; Sawyer said.andM;But many of the biologists, Farringer said, did not have the expertise orcapability to access the mainframe via dial-up links for data comparison.andM;&quot;Paul and I were sitting around saying, &quot;This is ridiculous,'&quot; Farringersaid.andP;  &quot;We have somebody out in the field, putting this information down on aform, then maybe 200 or 300 forms go to Denver at one time.&quot;andM;In many cases, BLM used state prisoners as keypunch operators and theyentered incorrect data, Farringer said.andM;&quot;We saw the portable computer solution as a means of eliminating a lot of thetime-consuming summarization and data transcription activity and alsoreducing the chance for errors, Sawyer said.andM;&quot;What was happening was that we had information that was being handled aboutfive separate times and then nobody was using the information,&quot; Farringersaid.andM;The process took as long as a year, which Farringer described as &quot;terrible.&quot;andO;After a while, biologists started shying away from correcting data that hadreturned from Denver, he said.andM;&quot;We've got data that was collected 15 years ago that's still sitting in acorner because people don't want to go through the effort,&quot; Farringer said.andO;&quot;We've got edit checks where the additional information is needed but isstill unfinished.andP;  That data has been there for four or five years, so wesaid, 'There's got to be a better way,'&quot; he said.andM;Under the department's Productivity Enhancement Funding (PEF) program,Farringer proposed in 1987 a $20,000 solution using six Zenith Data Systems'dual-disk Model 180 portable microcomputers.andP;  Biologists enter data on themicros from the field.andP;  Using a modified version of ASPN mainframe softwaremade by Techton Corp. of Boulder, Colo., edited to run on a PC, thebiologists use a menu-driven screen to enter the data.andP;  Later a copy of thedisk can be mailed to the Denver Service Center for uploading on the 8000.andM;Copies of information are sent to the state office for archiving, Farringersaid,andM;But Sawyer said developing the application took time -- time that proved hardto find.andM;&quot;One of the limitations Jerry and I found was getting time to work on thedevelopment end of the program.andP;  We've done a lot of it on our own time,&quot;Sawyer said.andP;  &quot;With other programs going on in the bureau, such as the Fishand Wildlife 2000 program, taking a lot of our time, we've had to steal bitsand pieces of time when we could get it.&quot;andM;Today the five district offices and six resource areas own 11 Zenith 180s andthree 80286 laptops and accompanying software.andP;  BLM officials estimate thatthe new system will save more than $231,100 over a three-year period in laborcosts alone.andM;Farringer was concerned about the durability of the PCs because they oftenwere transported over rugged terrain.andP;  Precautions such as metal and plasticcarrying cases protected the machines, he said, and no machine has failed tofunction in the field.andM;By using software such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro: The ProfessionalSpreadsheet from Borland International Inc. in Scotts Valley, Calif.,andO;biologists can begin analyzing data while still in the field.andP;  By using theextra software to create graphics, the biologists could determine if theywere doing enough sampling for accurate results, Farringer said.andM;Since the program began, Farringer said other applications have been foundfor the laptop in BLM, including fire fighting, fishery management, wildhorse and burrow management and range land management.andM;Although Farringer has enjoyed the satisfaction of knowing his answer toBLM's problem has brought in more accurate, timely and less-expensive data,he said the value of ingenuity has been the most important lesson.andM;&quot;I think the best part about this whole thing is it lets people know that ifthey have an idea, they should try it,&quot; Farringer said.andM;&quot;You never know what might develop -- something very useful could come out ofsome of these ideas.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
