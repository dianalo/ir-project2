<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1328 </DOCNO><TEXT>Tin is the most difficult of the common metals to refine. For many yearspure tin has been available from very pure ores and refining has beenpractised only by countries with impure ores and secondary smelters.At the same time, high-technology developments in tinplate, in solderingfor electronics, and in tin chemicals require better quality tin. Thechanges in the structure of the tin industry since the collapse of theLME tin market, and the continuing needs of the Eastern bloc countriesare putting pressure on the higher grades of tin. This is resulting inapplication of refining methods by the low-cost producers, which willincrease refining charges. In efforts to keep their operating costs down,they must purchase concentrates on the open market and these are relativelycontaminated, at a time when the output of clean concentrate is reducedin response to the low tin price. There is no uniquely successful methodof refining to remove all impurities and the intermediate products containingsubstantial amounts of tin which must be recycled are the source of muchof the extra cost. This should provide even more work for the secondarysmelters. Of some thirty smelters listed in the first part of this review,about twenty have survived, and this includes nine in Mexico and Brazilwith a protected internal market. Of those surviving, many are in poorengineering condition, and need rehabilitation, again requiring highersmelting charges.</TEXT></DOC>
