But Japanese government and business leaders see the bill giving U.S. trade negotiators stronger weapons to win concessions from Japan during trade disputes. And they chafe at the finger-pointing tone of the bill, which many say is insulting because it gives the impression that Japan is a villain despite concrete efforts by the Japanese to respond to their trading partners' complaints.    &quot;Congressional reaction doesn't reflect a change in today's relations. That is a source of frustration and that is why we are upset,&quot; says a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official.    The bill was passed by the Senate last week and sent on to President Reagan, who has said he will sign it. The legislation doesn't contain any significant tariff increases or new quotas and erects no new trade barriers. But from the Japanese point of view it still has a lot of teeth.    The so-called Super-301 clause, for example, beefs up existing law dealing with unfair trade practices. The existing law's 301 clause has proven to be one of the most effective weapons to force Japanese concessions, but it is rarely used because the president is often swayed by arguments within his administration that 301 needlessly angers the Japanese and risks making them less cooperative in the future. The new bill transfers authority to initiate unfair-trade cases and to order retaliation from the president to the U.S. trade representative, though the president will retain some discretionary power.    &quot;Because it is easier to impose sanctions, Japanese are nervous that the U.S. may in fact evoke sanctions more frequently,&quot; says Hideo Sato, dean of Tsukuba University's school of international relations.    Japanese also are troubled by clause 337 of the new bill, which offers protection for U.S. industries claiming injury from violations of patents, copyrights and other intellectual property. That is the looming area of trade disputes between the two countries, experts say, and Japanese fear the bill may force their companies to concede they are wrong, even when that is in doubt, in order to prevent injunctions that would stop sales and harm long-term marketing efforts in the U.S.    The major reason Japanese feel insulted by the bill is the inclusion of sanctions against Toshiba Corp. The electronics giant was singled out because of a subsidiary's sale of militarily sensitive milling equipment to the Soviet Union.    &quot;It's like going into somebody else's house and spanking their children,&quot; says Makota Kuroda, the retired vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry who until recently was in charge of Japan's trade negotiations.    Furthermore, Japanese officials say the bill is insulting because it seems to ignore strides Japan has made to open its markets and reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. &quot;The Japanese feel they have done everything possible to meet U.S. demands. They are very frustrated that Americans don't appreciate it,&quot; says Prof. Sato. </TEXT></DOC>
