(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From the days when inventor ThomasEdison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans havebeen regarded as naturally inventive and creative.   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists andengineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center,which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formedin 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison.   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, whichuses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internalorgans without X-rays.   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, notpulled from the depths of the earth.   In 1979, GE was the first company to pass the 50,000th patentmark.   But GE's _ and America's _ technological lead is being threatenedby the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clevercopycats.   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowedAmerican inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensivehousehold staples. Color television sets, transistor radios andvideocassettee recorders were all original American ideas theJapanese have capitalized on.   All that is changing.   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of Americanscientists and engineers for new technology, says Roland W. Schmitt,president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and formervice president of corporate research and development at GE.   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, Schmitt says.   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. Japan now acquiresmore patents worldwide than any other country.   Schmitt says the United States still leads the way in developingnew technology. ``But Japan is now in a stage where they're startingto do this,'' he said.   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for theircompanies to develop their own technology.   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will requireinnovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' saidKazuya Hosaka, manager of Hitachi Ltd.'s patent office in Tokyo.   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can bepioneering.   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quickat turning inventions into products and their students study scienceand technology in an education system considered superior in thoseareas.   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-takingand prizes collective action over individual effort. Theirscientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' Schmitt said.   A recent study for the National Science Foundation showed that in1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most U.S. patents:Hitachi with 873, Canon with 850 and Toshiba with 830.   GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, wasfourth with 782 patents.   GE executives at the company's Randamp;D center, located in a sprawlingcomplex of buildings overlooking the Mohawk River, dispute theresults of the patent study done by Computer Horizons, a consultingcompany. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if thestudy had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986.   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know RCA was asubsidiary of GE,'' said James C. Davis Jr., manager of patent andlegal operations at GE.   Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning.   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said Walter Robb,vice president of corporate research and development at GE. ``Thereare still three Japanese companies in the top four.''   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the United States is theirability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' Schmitt said. ``But welose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the longhaul.''   America's best hope in its competition with Japan may be itseducation system. The United States is far ahead of Japan in an areavital to technological and scientific development: the encouragementof creative thought.   Yet serious problems exist in America's education system.   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in scienceand technology,'' said Schmitt, a former chairman of the NationalScience Board.   He believes that for the United States to remain No. 1 in scienceand technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customerpreferences are integral parts of the innovation process, notafterthoughts,'' Schmitt said. ``I see no reason why we Americanscan't renew our skills at the application of science and technologywhile maintaining our strength as pioneers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thursday Dec. 29</NOTE></DOC>
