These amendments are proposed to conform the regulations to section1112(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86) (100 Stat. 2448). <ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Provisions </ITAG>Section 1112(a) of TRA '86 amended section 410(b) to modify the minimumcoverage rules applicable to qualified plans. The new rules generally areeffective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988. Under the newcoverage rules, a plan is a qualified plan only if it satisfies at leastone of three minimum coverage tests: (1) The percentage test; (2) the ratiotest; and (3) the average benefit test. Under the percentage test, a plan must benefit at least 70 percent of theemployer's nonhighly compensated employees. Under the ratio test, a planmust benefit a percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees that isat least 70 percent of the percentage of the highly compensated employeeswho benefit under the plan. Finally, under the average benefit test, aplan must benefit a classification of employees that the Secretary findsnot to be discriminatory in favor of highly compensated employees (nondiscriminatoryclassification test) and the average benefit percentage of the nonhighlycompensated employees must be at least 70 percent of the average benefitpercentage of the highly compensated employees (average benefit percentagetest). By adding the average benefit test to section 410(b), TRA '86 effectivelycombined the section 410(b) minimum coverage rules and the section 401(a)(4)general nondiscrimination rules. The legislative history to TRA '86 indicatesthat the average benefit percentage test generally is to be applied inthe same manner as the general nondiscrimination rules have been appliedwith respect to the amount of contributions or benefits under an employer'squalified plans. Before TRA '86, the primary statement of the Service on the calculationof the amount of contributions and benefits was Rev. Rul. 81-202, 1981-2C.B. 93. The legislative history to TRA '86 indicates that, in general,the approach of Rev. Rul. 81-202 is to form the basis for applying theaverage benefit percentage test. In this respect, however, the legislativehistory also indicates that the Service is to modify the Rev. Rul. 81-202approach, both for purposes of the average benefits test and for purposesof determining whether two or more plans that are treated as a single planfor purposes of section 410(b) discriminate in favor of highly compensatedemployees under section 401(a)(4). Also, the legislative history indicatesthat the approach developed by the Service is to be the exclusive approachfor applying the average benefit percentage and general nondiscriminationtests. The Service is developing interrelated regulations under sections 410(b)and 401(a)(4) addressing the minimum coverage rules of the former and thegeneral nondiscrimination rules of the latter. These interrelated regulationsgenerally reflect the basic view that, even though there are two statutoryprovisions that govern nondiscrimination_section 4l0(b) for coverage andsection 401(a)(4) for contributions and benefits_these statutory provisionsare substantially interwoven, focus on similar issues and require substantiallysimilar determinations. Indeed, as a practical matter, the interactionbetween these two provisions results in a coordinated nondiscriminationrule for qualified plans. In general, this rule requires that a nondiscriminatorygroup of employees actually benefit under one or more of an employer'squalified plans at each level of contribution or benefit and with respectto each other benefit, right or feature. These proposed regulations address only whether the group of employeeswho benefit under the plan at any level of contribution or benefit satisfiesthe section 410(b) minimum coverage requirement. Other nondiscriminationissues, such as the method for determining whether contributions or benefitssatisfy section 401(a)(4) and guidance on the average benefit percentagetest of section 410(b), will be addressed in forthcoming regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 410(b) Minimum Coverage Requirements </ITAG>The proposed regulations provide that, in order to satisfy section 410(b)for a plan year, a plan must satisfy one of two requirements for the planyear: (1) The percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees benefitingunder the plan must be at least 70 percent of the percentage of the highlycompensated employees benefiting under the plan (the ratio percentage test)or (2) the plan benefits a classification of employees that the Secretaryfinds not to be discriminatory in favor of highly compensated employees(the nondiscriminatory classification test) and the average benefit percentageof the nonhighly compensated employees is at least 70 percent of the averagebenefit percentage of the highly compensated employees (the average benefitpercentage test). (Together, the nondiscriminatory classification testand the average benefit percentage test are referred to as the averagebenefit test.) The ratio percentage test encompasses both the percentagetest and ratio test of sections 410(b)(1)(A) and 410(b)(1)(B), respectively;if a plan satisfies the statutory percentage test of section 410(b)(1)(A),it will necessarily also satisfy the ratio test of section 410(b)(1)(B).Multiple employer plans must satisfy the requirements of section 410(b)on an employer-by-employer basis rather than on the basis of participatingemployers in the aggregate. Failure to satisfy the requirements of section410(b) with respect to any component of this testing process may resultin disqualification of the plan for all participating employers. The proposedregulation does not provide an exception to this rule. However, in a propercase, the Commissioner could retain the plan's qualified status for innocentemployers by requiring corrective and remedial action with respect to theplan such as allowing the withdrawal of an offending employer, allowinga disqualifying defect to be cured within a reasonable period of time afterthe plan administrator has or should have had knowledge of such disqualifyingevent or was otherwise notified by the Internal Revenue Service of thedisqualifying defects, or requiring plan amendments to prevent future disqualifyingevents. 1. Employees Benefiting under the Plan Under the proposed regulations, an employee is ``benefiting'' under a planfor a year only if the employee accrues a benefit under the plan for suchyear. Thus, an employee generally is not benefiting under a plan merelybecause the employee is currently eligible to receive an allocation orto accrue a benefit under the plan. Similarly, an employee who has an accruedbenefit under a plan generally is not benefiting under the plan if theemployee is not currently receiving an allocation or accruing an additionalbenefit under the plan. The proposed regulations include a special rule pursuant to section 410(b)(6)(B)for plans to which elective contributions or after-tax employee contributionsand matching contributions subject to section 401(k) or 401(m) may be made.Under this rule, an employee is benefiting only if the employee is eligiblecurrently to make such elective contributions (in the case of the 401(k)feature) or to make after-tax employee contributions or receive matchingcontributions (in the case of the 401(m) feature). Also, there is a specialrule for plans under which no employee is eligible to accrue any additionalbenefit. Such a plan is treated as satisfying the coverage requirements.The position that a current accrual or allocation is necessary in orderfor an employee to be treated as benefiting is consistent with the explicitstatutory rule for section 401(k) or 401(m) contributions in section 410(b)(6)(E).If eligibility to make a section 401(k) contribution were, by itself, sufficientto treat an employee as benefiting under a plan, there would be no needfor a special statutory rule to achieve this result. Requiring a current benefit is also consistent with the approach takenin the proposed regulations under section 401(a)(26). Under those proposedregulations, an employee is not treated as currently benefiting unlessthe employee receives a current accrual of benefits. Commentators on the proposed section 401(a)(26) regulations have indicatedthe desirability of a minimum service requirement for ease in plan administration.However, a minimum service requirement may result in employees failingto benefit under the plan and may, therefore, cause the plan to fail tosatisfy the minimum participation requirements in operation. The same issuesarise under the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b). In response to these comments, these proposed regulations provide a specialminimum service accrual rule. Under this rule, a participant will be treatedas an excludable employee under the plan if the participant fails to accruea benefit or receive an allocation solely because of a minimum servicerequirement or a requirement that the employee be employed on the lastday of the plan year and the participant terminates employment with notmore than 500 hours of service. A similar rule is added to the proposedregulations under section 401(a)(26). This design-based rule enables anemployer to impose a minimum service requirement for purposes of ease ofplan administration thereby lessening the risk that employee turnover maycause the plan to fail in operation. Thus, for example, a plan, includinga standardized plan, that otherwise benefits all employees of an employerbut provides that employees who terminate from employment and completeless than 501 hours of service in a plan year will not accrue a benefitfor such year is treated as benefiting 100 percent of the employer's employees.In determining whether a plan satisfies the minimum coverage requirementsof section 410(b), employees who receive no accrual or allocation by reasonof a minimum service requirement or by reason of a requirement of employmenton the last day of the year (other than one falling within the scope ofthe special minimum service accrual rule for terminating employees) mustbe treated as not benefiting under the plan unless they are otherwise excludable.Thus, plans under which employees fail to accrue benefits or receive allocationsby reason of such provisions will not be assured of satisfying section410(b) even if all employees are eligible under the plan. Under a transitional rule for plan years commencing during 1989, employersmay treat employees as benefiting under a plan for purposes of sections410(b) and 401(a)(26) if such employees fail to accrue a benefit or receivean allocation solely by reason of failing to accrue 1000 hours of serviceor failing to be employed by the employer on the last day of the plan year.To the extent that revenue rulings 76-250, 1976-2 C.B. 124, and 81-210,1981-2 C.B. 89, conflict with the general rule that an employee is treatedas benefiting for purposes of section 410(b) only if the employee actuallyaccrues a benefit or receives an allocation, they are superseded. 2. Nondiscriminatory Classification Test The proposed regulations set forth a three-part test for purposes of determiningwhether a group of employees constitutes a nondiscriminatory classification.First, the regulations require that a classification of employees be reasonable,which means that it must reflect a bona fide business classification ofemployees, such as salaried employees and hourly employees, rather thana classification designed to increase qualified plan benefit disparities.This determination is to be made on a facts-and-circumstances basis. Second, the proposed regulations include an objective test for determiningwhether a reasonable classification is nondiscriminatory. This objectivetest has both a safe harbor and an unsafe harbor for determining whethera classification is nondiscriminatory. Also, the proposed regulations includea facts-and-circumstances nondiscrimination test for those cases that fallbetween the safe and unsafe harbors. In the past, the nondiscriminatory classification test generally has beenapplied on a facts-and-circumstances basis. The new minimum coverage rulesand the objective approach to the nondiscriminatory classification testare intended to minimize the uncertainty employers have experienced inapplying the facts and circumstances approach. For example, TRA '86 appliesa new objective definition of highly compensated employee (under section414(q)) and extends the excludable employee provision to the nondiscriminatoryclassification test. Similarly, the proposed regulations provide an objectiveapproach to nondiscriminatory classifications to assure that nondiscriminationstandards apply more evenly to employers and to provide employers withgreater certainty in planning and administering their plans. The objectivetest is generally based upon the nondiscriminatory classification standardscontained in the Service's formal guidance and is intended to enhance theuniform and equitable application of these standards.The standard for applying the nondiscriminatory classification test, reflectedin current regulations under section 410(b) (see andSection; 1.410(b)-1(d)(2)),is whether there is more than a reasonable difference between (1) the percentageof the employer's highly compensated employees who benefit under the plan(the highly compensated employee benefiting percentage) and (2) the percentageof the employer's nonhighly compensated employees who benefit under theplan (the nonhighly compensated employee benefiting percentage). Under the proposed regulations, the determination of whether or not a plan'sclassification is nondiscriminatory is based on satisfying, or failingto satisfy, a safe harbor or an unsafe harbor, respectiveiy. The objectivesafe and unsafe harbors are based on two factors: (1) The ratio of thepercentage of the employer's nonhighly compensated employees who benefitunder the plan to the percentage of the employer's highly compensated employeeswho benefit under the plan and (2) the percentage of all of the employeesof the employer who are not highly compensated employees (concentrationpercentage). The safe harbor test is met if the percentage of the employer's nonhighlycompensated employees who benefit under the plan is at least 50 percentof the percentage of the employer's highly compensated employees who benefitunder the plan. As the concentration percentage increases, the safe harbortest may also be met when the ratio percentage drops below 50 percent.Thus, as the concentration percentage increases from 60 to 99 percent,the ratio percentage drops proportionally from 50 percent to 20.75 percent.The proposed regulations provide an unsafe harbor under which a classificationis found to be discriminatory if the percentage of the employer's nonhighlycompensated employees who benefit under the plan is less than 40 percentof the percentage of the employer's highly compensated employees who benefitunder the plan. The ratio percentage decreases proportionally from 40 percentto 20 percent as the concentration percentage increases from 60 to 99 percent.If a plan's coverage falls between the safe and unsafe harbors, the relevantfacts and circumstances of the particular employer must be examined todetermine whether the plan's classification is nondiscriminatory. Amongthe factors that will be examined are (1) the underlying business reasonfor the classification, (2) the percentage of the employer's work forcebenefiting under the plan, (3) whether the number of covered employeesin each salary range is representative of the total number of the employer'semployees in such salary range, and (4) how close the classification comesto satisfying the safe harbor percentage. The nondiscriminatory classification test is applicable not only with respectto the section 410(b) minimum coverage rules, but also is incorporatedinto various other employee benefit provisions of the tax law. For example.under section 410(b)(5)(B) and section 89(g)(5), an employer's pensionor health plan must benefit a nondiscriminatory classification of employeesas a precondition to the use of the separate line of business rules ofsection 414(r). Also, section 125(b)(1) requires that a cafeteria planbenefit a nondiscriminatory classification of employees. See also sections120(c)(3), 127(b)(3), and 129(d)(4). The tests in these proposed regulationswith respect to the nondiscriminatory classification test as it appliesunder section 410(b) (including the transition relief) are applicable withrespect to all of these provisions, except sections 89, 410(b)(5)(B) and414(r), until other guidance is provided with respect to these provisions.3. Excludable Employees The proposed regulations provide guidance relating to those employees whomay be disregarded_the excludable employees_in applying section 410(b).One area relates to the treatment of employees who do not benefit undera plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (``nonunionemployees'') when testing a plan that benefits union employees. The proposedregulations clarify that nonunion employees are excludable employees forpurposes of testing a plan that benefits union employees. The proposedregulations thus continue the rule in effect under section 413(b) for testingcollectively bargained plans. However, certain plans that benefit morethan 2 percent professional employees are not treated as collectively bargainedplans. 4. Definition of Plan and Rules for Plan Aggregation and Disaggregation The proposed regulations provide extensive guidance on the definitionof a plan for purposes of section 41D(b). The determination of the planfor purposes of section 410(b) may, in certain circumstances, involve severalsteps of analysis. First, in general, each single plan determined under the rules of section414(l) is a separate plan for purposes of section 410(b).Second, certain single plans under section 414(l) must be treated as comprising,or be disaggregated into, two or more separate plans each of which mustsatisfy section 410(b). These mandatory disaggregation rules reflect therules governing whether certain different types of plans may be aggregatedfor purposes of sections 410(b) and 401(a)(4) and are designed to preventemployers from accomplishing through one plan a result that cannot be accomplishedthrough two or more plans. For example, the portion of a plan that benefitsemployees under a collective bargaining agreement and the portion of theplan that benefits nonunion employees are to be treated as separate plans.Similarly, the portion of a plan that is an employee stock ownership plan(ESOP) must be treated as a separate plan from the non-ESOP portion ofsuch plan. Finally, the portions of a plan that include a cash or deferredarrangement subject to section 401(k) or matching and employee contributionssubject to section 401(m) are treated as separate plans from the remainingportion of such plan.Third, for purposes of applying the ratio percentage test and nondiscriminatoryclassification test, two or more separate plans (determined after applicationof the preceding steps) may be treated as a single plan for purposes ofsection 410(b). However, there are certain limits to this permissive aggregation.These limits generally reflect the mandatory disaggregation rules describedin the preceding step. Fourth, for purposes of the average benefit percentage test, all plans(including deemed separate plans) of an employer that may be aggregatedunder the permissive aggregation rules must be aggregated and treated asa single plan. In addition, qualified cash or deferred arrangements andmatching contributions subject to section 401(m) are aggregated with otherplans. 5. Separate Lines of Business The proposed regulations do not address the rules for determining whetheran employer (determined after application of section 414 (b), (c), (m)and (o)) may be treated as comprising two or more separate lines of businessfor purposes of section 410(b). These rules are the subject of future regulationsunder section 414(r). However, the proposed regulations do indicate thatfor purposes of the excludable employee and plan disaggregation and aggregationrules, if an employer may be treated as operating two or more separatelines of business and elects to apply section 410(b) separately to suchlines of business under section 414(r), each such separate line of businesswill be treated as a separate employer. Thus, except for the nondiscriminatoryclassification test, in testing a plan that benefits the employees of oneseparate line of business, the employees of other separate lines of businessare excludable employees. Nevertheless, an employer may elect to combineone or more separate lines of business for purposes of satisfying section410(b). 6. Governmental Plans and Section 403(b) Contracts Since August 1977 (see News Release IR-1869 dated August 10, 1977), theService has not raised the issue of nondiscrimination under section 410or 401(a)(4) in the case of governmental plans. Beginning with the 1989plan year, governmental plans must satisfy the applicable nondiscriminationrequirements. In lieu of satisfying section 410(b), governmental plansand church plans must satisfy section 401(a)(3), as in effect prior tothe enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).Governmental and church plans that use section 403(b) annuity contractsmust, pursuant to section 403(b)(12), satisfy the new coverage rules. Sincesection 410(c) does not apply to such plans, satisfaction of section 401(a)(3)as in effect pre-ERISA does not satisfy section 403(b)(12). However, suchplans may continue to rely on the safe harbors published in Notice 89-23,1989-8 I.R.B. 25, in satisfying section 403(b)(12). <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 401(a)(26) Minimum Participation Requirements </ITAG>Proposed regulations under section 401(a)(26) that were published on February14, 1989, (54 FR 6710) are amended in response to comments in the followingfive respects. First, proposed andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-1 is amended to providethat defined contribution plans that presently benefit only nonhighly compensatedemployees may satisfy the section 401(a)(26) exception applicable to planscovering only nonhighly compensated employees without regard to whetherthey benefited highly compensated employees during the 5 immediately precedingplan years. Thus, for example, a defined contribution plan that benefitedboth highly compensated and nonhighly compensated employees prior to the1989 plan year, but freezes benefit allocations for highly compensatedemployees and benefits only nonhighly compensated employees commencingwith the first plan year beginning on or after January l, 1989, satisfiessection 401(a)(26) without regard to the number of employees benefiting.Second, proposed andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-2 is revised to provide an exceptionfrom the general rule that differences in the rates of benefit accrualresult in separate benefit structures. The exception is for ad hoc costof living adjustment formulas that contain such differences as a resultof reasonable efforts to adjust the benefits of former employees to reflectthe extent of the change in the cost of living since each employee's dateof retirement or commencement of benefit. In general, use of reasonablegroupings based on retirement date or benefit commencement is consistentwith the scope of this exception. Third, proposed andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-3 is revised to provide a specialminimum service rule for terminating employees consistent with the ruleprovided in the proposed regulations under section 410(b). Fourth, a transition rule is added to proposed andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-8for cash or deferred arrangements within the meaning of section 401(k).Pursuant to this rule eligibility to make elective contributions undera qualified cash or deferred arrangement (defined under section 401(k))pursuant to plan provisions as adopted and in effect on or before June19, 1989, but not after such date, may be disregarded for purposes of satisfyingthe requirements of section 401(a)(26). Thus, for example, such a planthat has a 1989 plan year commencing prior to June 19, 1989, may be amendedto comply with the requirements of section 401(a)(26) by expanding coverageor amending provisions with respect to elective contributions prospectivelyfrom June 19, 1989. Finally, proposed andSection; 1.401(a)(26)-8 is further amended to providea transition rule for certain early retirement ``windowperiod'' provisionsand for determining who benefits under a plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Dates and Transition Rules </ITAG>In general, the new minimum coverage rules apply for plan years beginningafter December 31, 1988. In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to oneor more collective bargaining agreements, the new rules do not apply toplan years beginning before the earlier of (1) the later of January 1,1989, or the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreementsin effect on February 28, 1986, terminates, or (2) January 1, 1991. The proposed regulations provide, however, that the employer may electnot to apply the objective tests applicable to determining whether an employer'splan benefits a nondiscriminatory classification of an employer's employeesfor plan years beginning before January 1, 1990. Thus, for plan years beginningin 1989, the employer may elect to apply the pre-TRA '86 facts-and-circumstancesstandards. This transition relief applies for purposes of all provisions(e.g., section 125) to which the nondiscriminatory classification testapplies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reliance on These Proposed Regulations </ITAG>Taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations for guidance pending theissuance of final regulations. These regulations will be generally effectivefor plan years beginning after 1988. If future regulations are more restrictive,such guidance will be applied without retroactive effect. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG>These proposed rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing </ITAG>Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be givento any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) tothe Internal Revenue Service. All comments will be available for publicinspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon written requestby any person who also submits written comments. If a public hearing isheld, notice of the time and place will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these proposed regulations is Nancy J.

For plan years beginningprior to the applicable effective date set forth in andSection; 1.410(b)-10,a plan satisfies section 410(b) only if it satisfies andSection; 1.410(b)-1for such year. For plan years beginning on or after the applicable effectivedate set forth in andSection; 1.410(b)-10, a plan satisfies section 410(b)only if it satisfies paragraph (b) of this section with respect to activeemployees for such year and paragraph (c) of this section with respectto former employees for such year. The rules in paragraphs (a), (b) and(c) of this section apply to all plans as a condition of qualification,including plans under which no employee is able to accrue any additionalbenefits (e.g., frozen plans). See section 403(b)(12)(A)(i) with respectto the application of section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder toannuity contracts described in section 403(b). Also, see andSection; 1.410(b)-7for rules defining ``plan'' and governing the treatment of separate plansas a single plan for purposes of applying the requirements of section 410(b).(b) <T3>Requirements with respect to active employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> A plan satisfies this paragraph (b) for a plan yearonly if it satisfies at least one of the following paragraphs (b)(2) through(b)(6) of this section for such year. (2) <T3>Ratio percentage test</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> A plan satisfies this paragraph (b)(2) (ratio percentagetest) for a plan year only if the percentage determined by dividing thepercentage of the nonhighly compensated active employees who benefit underthe plan by the percentage of the highly compensated active employees whobenefit under the plan is at least 70 percent. The applicable percentagesare determined by dividing the number of active employees benefiting underthe plan in such category by the total number of active employees in suchcategory. This test incorporates both the percentage test of section 410(b)(1)(A)and the ratio test of section 410(b)(1)(B). (ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> The following examples illustrate the application ofthe ratio percentage test of this paragraph (b)(2):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Assume that, for a plan year, Plan A benefits 100 percentof an employer's highly compensated active employees and 70 percent ofthe employer's nonhighly compensated active employees. The plan's ratiopercentage for such year is 70 percent (i.e., 70 percent divided by 100percent), and thus the plan satisfies the ratio percentage test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>Assume that, for a plan year, Plan B benefits 60 percentof the employer's highly compensated active employees and 40 percent ofthe employer's nonhighly compensated active employees. Plan B fails tosatisfy the ratio percentage test because the plan's ratio percentage isonly 66\2/3\ percent (i.e., 40 percent divided by 60 percent).</ITAG>(3) <T3>Average benefit test. </T3>A plan satisfies this paragraph (b)(3) fora plan year only if the plan satisfies the nondiscriminatory classificationtest of andSection; 1.410(b)-4 and the average benefit percentage test ofandSection; 1.410(b)-5 for such year. (4) <T3>Certain tax-credit employee stock ownership plans. </T3>A plan satisfiesthis paragraph (b)(4) for a plan year only if the plan_ (i) Is a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section409), (ii) Is the only plan of the employer that is intended to qualify undersection 401(a) and (iii) Is a plan that satisfies the rule set forth in section 410(b)(6)(D).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This paragraph (b)(4) is available only for plan years for which thetax credit employee stock ownership plan receives contributions for whichthe employer is allowed a tax credit under section 41 (as in effect priorto its repeal by the Tax Reform Act of 1986) or section 48(n) (as in effectprior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1984). The requirementof this paragraph (b)(4) that the plan be the only plan of the employerthat is intended to qualify under section 401(a) is not satisfied if theemployer has a single plan that is treated as separate plans pursuant tothe requirements of andSection; 1.410(b)-7(c). (5) <T3>Employers with no highly compensated employees, etc. </T3>A plan satisfiesthis paragraph (b)(5) for a plan year only if it is maintained by an employerthat, at all times during the plan year, either benefits no highly compensatedactive employees or has no nonhighly compensated active employees. (6) <T3>Certain governmental or church plans. </T3>A plan satisfies this paragraph(b)(6) for a plan year only if it is described in section 410(c) and suchplan satisfies the requirements of section 401(a)(3) as in effect on Septemberl, 1974. Plans that include annuity contracts described in section 403(b)are not eligible for the rule of this paragraph (b)(6). (c) <T3>Requirements with respect to former employees</T3>_(1) <T3>Former employees tested separately. </T3>Former employees are generallytested separately for purposes of section 410(b). Thus, former employeesare disregarded in applying the ratio percentage test, the nondiscriminatoryclassification test, and the average benefit percentage test with respectto the coverage of active employees under a plan. During the plan yearin which an employee terminates from service with the employer, such employeeis treated as an active employee in applying section 410(b) with respectto active employees and is treated as a former employee in applying section410(b) with respect to former employees. Any accrual or allocation withrespect to such employee during such plan year that arises with respectto such employee's status as an active employee is treated as an accrualor allocation of an active employee. Similarly, any accrual or allocationwith respect to such employee during such plan year that arises with respectto such employee's status as a former employee is treated as an accrualor allocation of a former employee. (2) <T3>Application of section 410(b) to former employees</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A plan under which no former employee is currentlybenefiting is deemed to satisfy section 410(b) with respect to its formeremployees. See andSection; 1.410(b)-3 for the meaning of ``benefiting''.A plan under which a former employee is currently benefiting (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a plan that is amended to provide an ad hoc cost of livingadjustment to the benefit provided a former employee under the plan) mustsatisfy section 410(b) with respect to its former employees. (ii) <T3>Testing former employees</T3>_(A) <T3>In general. </T3>A plan satisfies section 410(b) with respect to itsformer employees if it satisfies one of the tests in paragraphs (b)(2)through (b)(6) of this section with respect to its former employees. (B) <T3>Special rule. </T3>A plan is deemed to satisfy paragraph (b) of thissection with respect to its former employees with a current benefit ifat least ten former employees are currently benefiting under the plan andat least 60 percent of the former employees who are currently benefitingunder the plan are not highly compensated former employees. (C) <T3>Former employees tested. </T3>Coverage with respect to former employeesis tested separately from coverage with respect to active employees andis tested on the basis of all former employees of the employer. However,at the election of the employer, employees who are not currently benefitingand who became former employees either prior to calendar year 1984 or priorto the beginning of the tenth year before the year being tested may bedisregarded. (D) <T3>Alternative tests. </T3>The Commissioner may, only in revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability, prescribe alternativetests for determining whether or not section 410(b) is satisfied with respectto former employees. Those alternative tests may supplement or modify thetests set forth in this section. (d) <T3>Certain acquisitions or dispositions. </T3>See section 410(b)(6)(C)(relating to special rules for certain dispositions or acquisitions) fora special rule whereby a plan may be treated as satisfying section 410(b)for a limited period. Section 410(b)(6)(C) does not apply to acquisitionsor dispositions that occur prior to the first plan year to which section410(b) as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 applies. Thus, employerswho have a transaction described in section 410(b)(6)(C) that occurs inthe year prior to the first plan year in which section 410(b) (as amendedby the Tax Reform Act of 1986) first applies must satisfy section 410(b)(without regard to section 410(b)(6)(C)) in the first such plan year.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(b)-3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Employees who benefit under a plan. </ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>A plan benefits an active employee only in accordancewith the rules of paragraph (b) of this section. (b) <T3>Active employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) ofthis section, an active employee is treated as benefiting for a plan yearonly if for such plan year in the case of a defined contribution plan theemployee receives an allocation of contributions or forfeitures and inthe case of a defined benefit plan the employee receives a benefit accrual.(2) <T3>Exceptions to allocation or accrual requirement</T3>_(i) <T3>Special rule for no accruals. </T3>In the case of a defined contributionplan, if for the plan year no employee receives an allocation of contributionsor forfeitures, the plan is treated as satisfying section 410(b) for suchplan year. Thus, a defined contribution plan for which contributions ceaseand for which no forfeiture can be allocated satisfies section 410(b).In the case of a defined benefit plan. if for the plan year no employeeaccrues any additional benefits under the plan, the plan is treated assatisfying section 410(b) for such plan year. The special rule in thisparagraph (b)(2) is only available where there are no allocations or benefitaccruals for the plan year and thus, it is not available with respect toa top-heavy plan that has accruals required by section 416 or to a planwhere future compensation increases are taken into account in determiningthe accrued benefit under the plan. (ii) <T3>Plans subject to section 401(k) or section 401(m). </T3>An employeeis treated as benefiting under a plan (or the portion thereof) that issubject to section 401(k) or section 401(m) for a plan year if such employeeis an eligible employee with respect to such plan (or portion thereof)for such year without regard to whether or not contributions are actuallymade. For example, an employee is treated as benefiting under the portionof a plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement if theemployee is an eligible employee with respect to such arrangement for theyear whether or not the employee actually makes elective contributionsunder the arrangement for such year. See sections 401(k) and 401(m) andthe regulations thereunder. (iii) <T3>Section 415 limits. </T3>An employee is treated as benefiting undera plan for a plan year if the employee satisfies all of the applicableconditions for accruing a current benefit for such year but fails to accruea benefit solely because of the section 415 limits on benefits and annualadditions. (iv) <T3>Certain plan limits. </T3>An employee is treated as benefiting undera plan for a plan year if the employee satisfies all of the applicableconditions for accruing the maximum current benefit for such year but failsto accrue a benefit solely because of a uniformly applicable benefit limitunder the plan. Thus, for example, if a plan only takes into account thefirst 30 years of service for accrual purposes, a participant who has completedmore than 30 years of service is still treated as benefiting under theplan. (v) <T3>Benefit offset arrangements. </T3>An employee is treated as benefitingunder a plan for a plan year even if the current benefit accrual is offsetby the contributions or benefits under another plan, if all other conditionsfor the current benefit accrual or allocation are satisfied. (c) <T3>Certain terminating employees</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>An employee is treated as an excludable employee fora plan year with respect to a particular plan if_ (i) The employee does not benefit under the plan for the plan year, (ii) The employee is eligible to participate under the plan, (iii) The plan has a minimum period of service requirement or a requirementthat an employee be employed on the last day of the plan year (last-dayrequirement) in order for an employee to accrue a benefit or receive anallocation for the plan year, (iv) The employee fails to accrue a benefit or receive an allocation underthe plan solely because of the failure to satisfy the minimum period ofservice or last-day requirement and (v) The employee terminates employment during the plan year with not morethan 500 hours of service and the employee is not an active employee asof the last day of the plan Year. (2) <T3>Hours of service, etc. </T3>The term ``hours of service'' has the samemeaning as provided for such term by 29 CFR 2530.200b-2 under the generalmethod of crediting service for the employee. If one of the equivalenciesset forth in 29 CFR 2530.200b-3 is used for crediting service under theplan, the 500-hour requirement must be adjusted accordingly. (d) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the determinationof whether an employee is benefiting under a plan for purposes of section410(b) and the regulations thereunder.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>An employer has 35 active employees who are eligibleunder a defined benefit plan and who are employed on the last day of theplan year. The plan requires 1000 hours of service to accrue a benefit.Only 30 employees satisfy the 1000-hour requirement and accrue a benefit.The five employees who do not satisfy the 1000-hour requirement duringthe plan year are taken into account in testing the plan under section410(b) but are treated as not benefiting under the plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>An employer has 35 active employees who are eligibleunder a defined contribution plan. The plan provides that an employee willnot receive an allocation of contributions for a plan year unless the employeeis employed by the employer on the last day of the plan year. Only 30 employeesare employed by the employer on the last day of the plan year. Two of thefive employees who terminated employment before the last day of the planyear had less than 501 hours of service during the plan year, and the remainingthree such employees had more than 500 hours of service during such year.Of the five employees who were no longer employed on the last day of theplan year, the two with 500 hours of service or less during the plan yearare treated as excludab1e employees for purposes of section 410(b), andthe remaining three who had over 500 hours of service during the plan yearbut are taken into account in testing the plan under section 410(b) butare treated as not benefiting under the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3> An employer has 30 active employees who are eligibleunder a defined contribution plan. The plan requires 1000 hours of serviceto receive an allocation of contributions or forfeitures. Ten employeesdo not receive an allocation because of their failure to complete 1000hours of service. Three of the 10 employees who failed to satisfy the minimumservice requirement completed less than 501 hours of service and terminatedtheir employment. Two of the employees completed between 501 and 1000 hoursof service and terminated their employment. The remaining five employeesdid not terminate employment. Under the rule in paragraph (c) of this section,the three terminated employees who completed less than 501 hours of serviceare treated as excludable employees for the portion of the plan year theyare employed. The other seven employees who do not receive an allocationare taken into account in testing the plan under section 410(b) but aretreated as not benefiting under the plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(b)-4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Nondiscriminatory classification test. </ITAG>(a)<T3> In general.</T3> A plan satisfies the nondiscriminatory classificationtest of this section for a plan year only if, for such year, the plan providesthat employees are eligible to benefit under the plan under a classificationset up by the employer in accordance with paragraph (b) of this sectionand such classification of employees is nondiscriminatory under paragraph(c) of this section.

Other facts and circumstancesmay also be considered relevant. (A) The underlying business reason for the classification.

Employer A maintainsa plan that benefits 72 highly compensated employees so that the highlycompensated employee benefiting percentage is 90 percent (72/80). The safeharbor percentage is 50 percent and the unsafe harbor percentage is 40percent. If the plan benefits at least 45 percent (50 percent times 90percent) of the nonhighly compensated employees, or 54 employees, the classificationis within the safe harbor and thus is considered nondiscriminatory. Ifthe plan benefits less than 36 percent (40 percent times 90 percent) ofthe nonhighly compensated employees, or 44 employees, the classificationis within the unsafe harbor and thus is considered discriminatory.

(2) <T3>Rules of application. </T3>Except as specifically provided otherwise,the rules under this section are to be applied by reference only to theplan or plans being tested under section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder.See andSection; 1.410(b)-7 for rules governing the determination of the planfor purposes of section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, indetermining whether a particular plan satisfies the ratio percentage testof andSection; 1.410(b)-2(b)(2), the rules under this section generally areapplied on the basis of only such plan. Similarly, in determining whethertwo or more plans that are treated as a single plan satisfy the ratio percentagetest of andSection; 1.410(b)-2(b)(2), paragraphs (b) through (h) of thissection generally are applied on the basis of only such deemed single plan.See andSection; 1.410(b)-7(e) for rules governing those plans that are takeninto account in applying the average benefit percentage test. (b) <T3>Minimum age and service exclusions_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>If a plan applies minimum age and service eligibilityconditions permissible under section 410(a)(1) (without regard to subparagraph(B) thereof) and excludes all active employees who do not meet such conditionsfrom benefiting under the plan, then all active employees who fail to satisfysuch conditions may be treated as excludable employees with respect tosuch plan. (2) <T3>Plans benefiting otherwise excludable employees_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Employees who would be excludable under paragraph(b)(1) of this section but for the fact that the plan does not apply thegreatest permissible minimum age and service conditions may be treatedas excludable employees with respect to the plan. This treatment is availableonly if the plan satisfies section 410(b) and andSection; 1.410(b)-2 withrespect to such otherwise excludable employees in the manner describedin paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. In such a case, the plan may betreated as comprising two separate plans, one for the otherwise excludableemployees and one for the other employees for purposes of applying section410(b). (ii) <T3>Testing otherwise excludable employees. </T3>In determining whetherthe plan (or portion of a plan that is treated as a separate plan) thatbenefits active employees who would otherwise be excludable under paragraph(b)(1) of this section satisfies section 410(b) and andSection; 1.410(b)-2,active employees who have satisfied the greatest permissible minimum ageand service conditions with respect to the plan are disregarded. In addition,if the plan (or portion thereof) being tested applies minimum age and serviceconditions and those conditions are less than the maximum permissible minimumage and service conditions, active employees who have not satisfied thelower minimum age and service conditions actually provided for in the planmay be treated as excludable employees. Thus, for example, if the planrequires attainment of age 18 and 3 months of service, employees who havenot attained age 18 or 3 months of service with the employer may be excluded.(3) <T3>Multiple age and service conditions. </T3>If a plan has two or moredifferent sets of minimum age and service eligibility conditions, thoseemployees who fail to satisfy all of the different sets of age and serviceconditions may be treated as excludable employees. An employee who satisfiesany one of the different sets of conditions is not an excludable employee.(4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the application ofthe minimum age and service condition rules of this paragraph (b):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>An employer maintains an hourly plan A and a salariedplan B. Plan A has no minimum age or service condition. Plan B has no minimumage condition and requires 1 year of service. The employer treats plansA and B as a single plan for purposes of section 410(b). Because plan Aimposes no minimum age or service condition, all employees of the employercan satisfy the minimum age and service conditions of plan A. Therefore,no employees may be treated as excludable employees in testing plans Aand B for purposes of section 410(b). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>An employer maintains three plans. Plan A benefitsemployees in division A who have satisfied the plan's minimum age and servicecondition of age 21 and 1 year of service. Plan B benefits employees indivision B who have satisfied a minimum age and service condition of age18 and 1 year of service. Plan C benefits employees in division C who havesatisfied a minimum age and service condition of age 21 and 6 months ofservice. The employer does not comprise separate lines of business undersection 414(r). The employer treats plans B and C as a single plan forpurposes of section 410(b). In testing plan A under the ratio percentagetest or the nondiscriminatory classification test of section 410(b), employeeswho have failed both to attain age 21 and to have performed at least 1year of service may be treated as excludable employees. In testing plansB and C, employees who have not satisfied the age and service requirementsof either of the two plans may be treated as excludable employees. Thus,an employee may be treated as an excludable employee with respect to plansB and C only if the employee has neither attained age 18 and performedat least 1 year of service, nor attained age 21 and performed at least6 months of service. Thus, an active employee who is 19 years old and hasperformed 11 months of service can be treated as an excludable employee.Similarly, an employee who is 17 years old and has performed 2 years ofservice can be treated as an excludable employee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3. </T3>An employer maintains three plans. Plan A benefitsall employees in division A (the plan does not apply any minimum age orservice condition). Plan B benefits employees in division B who have satisfieda minimum age and service condition of age 18 and 1 year of service. PlanC benefits employees in division C who have satisfied a minimum age andservice condition of age 21 and 6 months of service. The employer doesnot comprise separate lines of business under section 414(r). In testingthe employer's plans under the average benefit percentage test providedin andSection; 1.410(b)-5, plans A, B and C are treated as a single plan.Therefore, because plan A does not apply any minimum age or service condition,no active employee may be treated as an excludable employee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4. </T3>An employer maintains Plan A. Plan A benefits all employeesin division A (the plan does not apply any minimum age or service conditions).The employer has 110 employees who either have not completed 1 year ofservice or have not attained age 21. Of these 110 employees, 10 are highlycompensated employees and 100 are nonhighly compensated employees. PlanA benefits 5 of these highly compensated employees, or 50 percent of thesehighly compensated employees. Plan A benefits 35 of these nonhighly compensatedemployees, or 35 percent of these nonhighly compensated employees. PlanA satisfies the ratio percentage test of section 410(b) with respect toemployees who do not satisfy the greatest permissible minimum age and servicerequirement (the ratio of nonhighly compensated employees benefiting underthe plan (35 percent) is equal to 70 percent of the ratio of the highlycompensated employees benefiting under the plan (50 percent)). Thus, indetermining whether or not Plan A satisfies section 410(b), the 110 employeesmay be treated as excludable employees in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)of this section.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Certain nonresident aliens. </T3>An employee who is a nonresident alienand who receives no earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2))from the employer that constitutes income from sources within the UnitedStates (within the meaning of section 861(a)(3)) is to be treated as anexcludable employee. This paragraph (c) applies even if such nonresidentalien benefits under the plan. (d) <T3>Certain employees covered pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</T3>An employee who is included in a unit of employees covered by an agreementthat the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreementbetween employee representatives and one or more employers, if there isevidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargainingbetween employee representatives and such employer or employers, is treatedas an excludable employee with respect to the portion of a plan that doesnot benefit any employee who is included in such a collective bargainingunit of employees. This paragraph (d) applies without regard to whetherthe employee included in the collective bargaining unit actually benefitsunder any other plan of the employer. See section 7701(a)(46) and andSection;301.7701-17T (Temporary) for additional requirements applicable to thecollective bargaining agreement. If more than 2 percent of the employeescovered under a collective bargaining agreement are professional employees,the employees covered under such agreement are not treated as covered bya collective bargaining agreement. Special rules are set forth in andSection;1.410(b)-7, providing that the portion of a plan that benefits employeesunder a collective bargaining unit is treated as a separate plan from theportion that benefits non-collective bargaining unit employees and fromthe portion that benefits employees under a different collective bargainingagreement. (e) <T3>Collectively bargained plans_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>This paragraph (e) provides rules with respect toa plan described in section 413(a), relating to collectively bargainedplans. Section 413(b)(1) provides that section 410(b) is applied to a section413(a) plan as if all employees of each of the employers who are partiesto the collective bargaining agreement and who are subject to the samebenefit computation formula were employed by a single employer. Consequently,such a plan satisfies section 410(b) with respect to such employees becauseall other employees are excludable employees and are therefore disregarded.(2) <T3>Covered by a collective bargaining agreement. </T3>An employee is coveredby a collective bargaining agreement only if such employee is representedby a bona fide employee representative that is a party to the collectivebargaining agreement under which the plan is maintained. Thus, for example,an employee of either the plan or the employee representative is not includedin a unit of employees covered pursuant to the collective bargaining agreementunder which the plan is maintained merely because the employee is coveredunder the plan pursuant to an agreement entered into by the plan or employeerepresentative on behalf of the employee (other than in the capacity ofan employee representative with respect to such employee). This is thecase even if all of such employees benefiting under the plan constituteonly a de minimis percentage of the total employees benefiting under theplan. (3) <T3>Plans covering professional employees_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>An employee is not considered covered by a collectivebargaining agreement for a plan year if, for such year, more than 2 percentof the employees who are covered pursuant to such agreement are professionals.This rule applies to all employees under the agreement, nonprofessionalsas well as professionals. See andSection; 1.410(b)-9(g) for the definitionof ``professional''. Thus, such employees are not excludable employeeswith respect to employees who are not covered by a collective bargainingagreement. (ii) <T3>Multiple collective bargaining agreements. </T3>This paragraph (e)(3)is applied separately with respect to each collective bargaining agreement.Thus, for example, if a plan benefits two groups of employees, one coveredby collective bargaining agreement X, more than 2 percent of whom are professionals,and another covered by collective bargaining agreement Y, none of whomare professionals, the group covered by agreement X are not consideredcovered by a collective bargaining agreement and the group covered by agreementY are considered covered by a collective bargaining agreement. (iii) <T3>Application of minimum coverage tests. </T3>A plan that covers professionalemployees must satisfy section 410(b) without regard to section 413(b)and the special rule in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. In such cases,all nonexcludable employees must be taken into account. For this purpose,employees included in other collective bargaining units are excludableemployees. However, the employees who are not covered by a collective bargainingagreement and the employees who are covered by such an agreement that hasmore than 2 percent professionals are not excludable employees.(f)<T3> Examples.</T3> The following examples illustrate the application ofthe collective bargaining unit rules of this section.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> An employer has 700 employees (none of whom is a professionalemployee) who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collectivebargaining agreement and 300 employees (200 of whom are highly compensatedemployees) who are not included in the collective bargaining unit of employees.For purposes of applying the ratio percentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-2to plan X, which benefits only the 300 employees who are not included inthe collective bargaining unit, the 700 employees included in the collectivebargaining unit are treated as excludable employees pursuant to paragraph(d) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> (i) An employer has 1500 employees who fall into thefollowing categories:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,10,6</C> <H1>  </H1><H1>Non-bargaining unit</H1><H1>Bargaining unit </H1><H1>Total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">HCE<D> 100</D><D> 100 </D><D>200 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NHCE<D> 900 </D><D>400 </D><D>1,300</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>1,000</D><D> 500</D><D> 1,500</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="21">The employer maintains plan Y, which benefits 1100 employees, includingall of the non-bargaining unit employees except for 100 of the nonhighlycompensated employees, and 200 of the collective bargaining unit employeesincluding the 100 highly compensated bargaining unit employees. There areno professional employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement.In accordance with andSection; 1.410(b)-7(c), the employer must apply theratio percentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-2 to plan Y as if such planwere two separate plans, one benefiting the non-collective bargaining unitemployees and the other benefiting the collective bargaining unit employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In testing the portion of plan Y that does not benefit any collectivebargaining unit employee, the collective bargaining unit employees areexcludable employees.

Therefore, the 1000 non-bargainingunit employees and the 300 bargaining unit employees not benefiting underthe plan are treated as excludable employees. This portion of plan Y alsosatisfies the ratio percentage test because it is treated as benefiting100 percent of the highly compensated employees (100 out of 100 highlycompensated employees) and 100 percent of the nonhighly compensated employees(100 out of 100 of nonhighly compensated employees). Section 410(b) issatisfied in all cases whatever the composition of highly and nonhighlycompensated employees benefiting under the plan because of the specialrule under paragraph (e)(1) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3> An employer has 1100 employees who fall into the followingcategories:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,10,10,6</C> <H1>  </H1><H1>Non-bargaining unit </H1><H1>Bargaining unit </H1><H1>Total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">HCE<D> 100</D><D> 80</D><D> 180 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NHCE <D>900 </D><D>20 </D><D>920</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>1,000 </D><D>100 </D><D>1,100</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="21">The employer maintains plan Z, which benefits all of the bargainingunit employees. More than 2 percent of the bargaining unit employees areprofessional employees. Therefore, plan Z cannot be tested under the coveragerules in section 413(b). None of the employees in the bargaining unit includingboth the nonprofessional and professional employees may be treated as excludableemployees under the rules in paragraph (e) because they are treated asnot covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, in testingplan Z, all employees are taken into account. Plan Z fails to satisfy theratio percentage test, because it benefits 44.44 percent of the highlycompensated employees (80/180) and 2.17 percent of the nonhighly compensatedemployees (20/920) for a ratio of 4.895 percent.</ITAG>(g)<T3> Employees of separate lines of business.</T3> In the case of an employerthat comprises two or more separate lines of business under section 414(r)that are recognized for purposes of section 410(b), in testing a plan thatbenefits the employees of one of such separate lines of business, the employeesof the other separate lines of business are to be treated as excludableemployees.

(h)<T3> Certain terminating employees.</T3> See andSection; 1.410(b)-3(d) forrules under which certain terminating employees are treated as excludableemployees with respect to a particular plan. (i)<T3> Excludable former employees.</T3> An active employee who is an excludableemployee under tho rules of paragraph (b), (c), (d), (e), (g) or (h) ofthis section at the time of termination of employment is an excludableformer employee after such termination.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(b)-7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of plan and rules governing plan disaggregation and aggregation.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general. </T3>In general, the term ``plan'' refers to a plan describedin section 401(a) that includes one or more trusts intended to be exemptfrom tax under section 501(a) and to an annuity plan described in section403(a). As described in paragraph (b) of this section, each single planunder section 414(l) is to be treated as a single plan for purposes ofsection 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. Furthermore, as describedin paragraph (c) of this section, certain single plans must be treatedas comprising separate plans, each of which is a single plan subject tosection 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. Under paragraph (d) of thissection, for purposes of the ratio percentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-2and the nondiscriminatory classification test of andSection; 1.410(b)-4,an employer may elect to aggregate certain separate plans to form a singleplan. Finally, under paragraph (e) of this section, in applying the averagebenefit percentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-5, certain separate plansmust be aggregated to form a single plan. (b) <T3>Separate asset pools are separate plans. </T3>Each single plan withinthe meaning of section 414(l) is a separate plan for purposes of section410(b). See andSection; 1.414(l)-1(b). For example, if only a portion ofthe assets under a defined benefit plan is available, on an ongoing basis,to provide the benefits of certain employees and the remaining assets areavailable only in certain limited cases to provide such benefits (but areavailable in all cases for the benefit of other employees), there are twoseparate plans. A single plan under section 414(l) is a single plan forpurposes of section 410(b) notwithstanding that such plan comprises separatewritten documents and separate trusts, each of which have received separatedetermination letters from the Internal Revenue Service. A defined contributionplan does not comprise separate plans merely because it includes more thanone trust or it provides for separate accounts and permits employees todirect the investment of the amounts allocated to their accounts. Further,a plan does not comprise separate plans merely because assets are separatelyinvested in individual insurance or annuity contracts for employees. (c) <T3>Mandatory disaggregation of certain plans_</T3>(1) <T3>Plans benefiting collective bargaining unit employees. </T3>A planthat benefits employees who are included in a unit of employees coveredby a collective bargaining agreement and employees who are not includedin such a collective bargaining unit is treated as comprising separateplans for purposes of applying section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder.This paragraph (c)(1) is applied separately with respect to each collectivebargaining unit. Thus, for example, if a plan benefits employees in threecategories_employees included in collective bargaining unit A, employeesincluded in collective bargaining unit B, and employees who are not includedin any collective bargaining unit_such plan is treated as comprising threeseparate plans, each of which benefits only one category of employees andeach of which must satisfy the requirements of section 410(b) and the regulationsthereunder. Similarly, if a plan benefits only employees who are includedin collective bargaining unit A and collective bargaining unit B, suchplan is treated as comprising two separate plans. (2) <T3>ESOPs and non-ESOPs. </T3>The portion of a plan that is an employeestock ownership plan described in section 4975(e)(7) or section 409 (anESOP) and the portion of such plan that is not an ESOP are treated as separateplans for purposes of section 410(b). Notwithstanding andSection; 1.410(b)-10,an employer may treat the rule in this paragraph (c)(2) as not effectivefor plan years beginning before January 1, 1990. (3) <T3>Qualified cash or deferred arrangements and matching contributions.</T3>The portion of a plan that consists of contributions under a qualifiedcash or deferred arrangement (section 401(k)) and the portion of a planthat does not consist of such contributions are treated as separate plansfor purposes of section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. Similarly,the portion of a plan that consists of matching contributions and employeecontributions (section 401(m)) and the portion of a plan that does notconsist of such contributions are treated as separate plans for purposesof section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, aplan that includes contributions under a qualified cash or deferred arrangementunder section 401(k), matching contributions and employee contributionsunder section 401(m) and other contributions is treated as three separateplans for purposes of section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder. (4) <T3>Plans benefiting otherwise excludable employees. </T3>If an employerelects to apply section 410(b) separately to the portion of a plan thatbenefits only employees who satisfy age and service conditions that arelower than the greatest minimum age and service conditions permissibleunder section 410(a), such plan is treated as comprising separate plans,one benefiting the employees who have satisfied such lower minimum ageand service conditions but not the greatest minimum age and service conditionspermissible under section 410(a) and one benefiting employees who havesatisfied the greatest minimum age and service conditions permissible undersection 410(a). (5) <T3>Plans of separate lines of business. </T3>If an employer is treatedas operating two or more separate lines of business under section 414(r),the employer elects to apply section 410(b) separately to such businessesand section 410(b)(5) is satisfied, a plan that benefits the employeesof a separate line of business is treated as a separate plan from any planthat is maintained by any other line of business. (6) <T3>Plans maintained by more than one emplover_</T3>(i) <T3>Multiple employer plans. </T3>If a plan benefits employees of morethan one employer and such employees are not included in a unit of employeescovered by a collective bargaining agreement (a multiple employer plan),the plan is treated as comprising separate plans each of which is maintainedby a separate employer and must satisfy section 410(b) by reference onlyto such employer's employees. (ii) <T3>Multiemployer plans. </T3>The portion of a plan that benefits employeeswho are included in a collective bargaining unit, the portion of such planthat benefits employees who are included in another collective bargainingunit and the portion of such plan that benefits non-collective bargainingunit employees are all treated as separate plans for purposes of section410(b). Consistent with section 413(b), the portion of the plan that ismaintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement is treated asa single plan maintained by a single employer that employs all the employeesbenefiting under the same benefit computation formula and covered pursuantto that collective bargaining agreement. The non-collectively bargainedportion of the plan is treated as maintained by one or more employers,depending on whether the non-collective bargaining unit employees who benefitunder the plan are employed by one or more employers.(d) <T3>Permissive aggregation for ratio percentage and nondiscriminatory classificationtests</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>For purposes of applying the ratio percentage andnondiscriminatory classification tests of andSection; 1.410(b)-2, exceptas provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, an employermay elect to designate two or more separate plans (determined after applicationof paragraph (b) of this section) of such employer as a single plan. Ifan employer elects to treat two or more of its separate plans as a singleplan under this paragraph, such plans must be treated as a single planfor all purposes under sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b).(2) <T3>Rules of disaggregation apply. </T3>An employer cannot elect to aggregatetwo or more plans that are mandatorily disaggregated under the rules inparagraph (c) of this section. Thus, for example, a plan that benefitsboth collective bargaining unit employees and non-collective bargainingunit employees that must be disaggregated because of the rules in paragraph(c)(1) of this section may not be permissively aggregated. (3) <T3>Duplicative aggregation. </T3>A plan cannot be combined with two ormore plans to form more than one single plan. Thus, for example, an employerthat maintains plans A, B and C cannot aggregate plans A and B and plansA and C to form two single plans. However, such employer may, for example,aggregate plans A, B and C, to form plan ABC, plans AB and C, plans ACand B, or plans A and BC. (e) <T3>Mandatory aggregation for average benefit percentage test</T3>_(1)<T3>In general. </T3>In determining whether a plan satisfies andSection;1.410(b)-2(b)(3), it is necessary to determine whether the average benefitpercentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-5 is satisfied. For purposes of applyingthe average benefit percentage test, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)of this section, all qualified plans of the employer must be taken intoaccount to form a single plan, including contributions and/or benefitsunder qualified cash or deferred arrangements (section 401(k)) and matchingcontributions and employee contributions (section 401(m)). (2) <T3>Rules of disaggregation apply. </T3>Plans that are mandatorily disaggregatedunder the rules in paragraph (c)(1), (2), (3), (5) or (6) of this sectionmust separately satisfy the average benefit percentage test of andSection;1.410(b)-5. (f) <T3>Section 403(b) annuities. </T3>In determining whether a plan satisfiessection 410(b), a plan funded by annuity contracts described in section403(b) is disregarded. However, in determining whether a plan funded byannuity contracts under section 403(b) satisfies section 410(b) (by reasonof section 403(b)(12)(A)(i)), plans that are not funded by annuity contractsdescribed in section 403(b) may be taken into account. See section 403(b)(12)(A)(i)and the regulations thereunder with respect to the application of thissection to plans funded by annuity contracts described in section 403(b).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(b)-8 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Special rules. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Determination with respect to an applicable year</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>A plan satisfies the requirements of section 410(b)and the regulations thereunder if it meets at least one of the tests setforth in andSection; 1.410(b)-2(b)(2) through (6) on each day of the yearbeing tested. For purposes of this section, a plan will be deemed to satisfythe relevant test if the plan satisfies such test on at least one day ineach quarter of the year being tested. If the plan's eligibility rulesor benefit formula operates to cause the four quarterly testing days tonot reasonably represent the coverage of the plan over the entire planyear, the test must be satisfied on each day of the plan year. A plan isdeemed to satisfy the average benefit percentage test of andSection; 1.410(b)-5if the plan satisfies such test on an annual basis. For purposes of thistest, all employees employed by the employer during the year being testedare taken into account.(2) <T3>Retroactive correction.</T3> If a plan fails to satisfy section 410(b)for one or more days during a plan year, such plan may be amended by thelast day of such plan year to satisfy section 410(b) retroactively, basedon the facts as they existed on the day or days of failure, by expandingcoverage or by improving benefits or contributions or by modifying eligibilityconditions under the plan. The need to retroactively amend to satisfy section410(b) does not constitute a basis for eliminating or reducing a benefitin violation of section 411(d)(6). (b) <T3>Year for purposes of testing minimum coverage</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> In general, the applicable year for purposes of determiningwhether a plan meets the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b)and the regulations thereunder is the plan year of the plan being tested.(2) <T3>Plan year.</T3> For purposes of section 410(b) and the regulationsthereunder, the plan year is the plan year of the qualified plan as definedin the written plan document. In the absence of a specifically designatedplan year, the plan year will be deemed to be the calendar year. (3) <T3>Aggregation of two or more plans.</T3> If, in accordance with andSection;1.410(b)-7(d), two or more plans are treated as a single plan for purposesof section 410(b) and the regulations thereunder, such otherwise separateplans cannot have different plan years. Notwithstanding the provisionsof andSection; 1.410(b)-10, the employer may treat the rule in this paragraph(b)(3) as not effective for plan years beginning before January 1, 1990.(4) <T3>Average benefit percentage test.</T3> The determination of whetherthe average benefit percentage test in andSection; 1.410(b)-5 is satisfiedis made on the basis of plan years ending with or within the same calendaryear. (c) <T3>Family member aggregation rule.</T3> For purposes of section 410(b)and the regulations thereunder, in accordance with section 414(q)(6), ahighly compensated employee who is a 5-percent owner or one of the 10 mosthighly compensated employees and any family member or members of such highlycompensated employee who is also an employee of the employer are to betreated as a single highly compensated employee. If any member of suchgroup is benefiting under a plan, the deemed single employee is treatedas benefiting under the plan. If no member of such group is benefitingunder a plan, the deemed single employee is treated as not benefiting underthe plan. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.410(b)-9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Employee</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> The term ``employee'' means an individual who performsservices for the employer who is either a common law employee of the employer,a self-employed individual who is treated as an employee pursuant to section401(c)(1), or a leased employee who is treated as an employee of the employer-recipientpursuant to the provisions of section 414(n)(2) or section 414(o)(2), otherthan individuals who are excluded by reason of section 414(n)(5).

The plan must satisfythe average benefit percentage test for the 1989 plan year. If a plan'sclassification has been determined by the Commissioner to be nondiscriminatoryand there have been no significant changes or omissions in a material fact,the classification will be treated as nondiscriminatory for the 1989 planyear. (2) <T3>Employees who benefit under a plan. </T3>Notwithstanding paragraph(a) of this section, for the first plan year beginning after December 31,1988, and before January 1, 1990, any employee who is eligible to participateunder the plan and who fails to accrue a benefit solely because of thefailure to satisfy either a minimum-period-of-service requirement of 1000hours of service or less or a last-day requirement may be treated as benefitingunder the plan, provided that all such employees are treated as benefitingunder the plan.

Employer A also maintains Plan 2 that covers A's other 400 nonunionemployees. The agreement under which Plan 1 is maintained was entered intoon January l, 1986, and expires December 31, 1992. Because Plan l is acollective bargaining unit plan, section 410(b) applies to the first planyear beginning on or after January 1, 1991. In applying section 410(b)to Plan 2, the 100 nonunion employees in Plan l must be taken into account.The deferred effective date for collectively bargained plans is not applicablein determining how section 410(b) is applied to a non-collectively bargainedplan.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Collective bargaining unit plan. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph(c), a plan is a collective bargaining unit plan if it is a plan maintainedpursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employeerepresentatives and one or more employers, where one or more of such agreementswere ratified before March 1, 1986. Only plans maintained pursuant to agreementsthat the Secretary of Labor finds to be collective bargaining agreementsand that satisfy the requirements of section 7701(a)(46) and the regulationsthereunder are eligible for the deferred effective date under this paragraph(c). A plan shall not be treated as a collective bargaining unit plan eligiblefor the deferred effective date under this paragraph (c) unless the planwould be a plan maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreementunder the principles applied under section 1017(c) of the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act of 1974.
