In a rational society, prudence and judgment also count for something. This will come as big news to plaintiff tort lawyers, not to mention Robocop prosecutors who think foreign policy is mainly a matter of law enforcement.    The lesson of Monday's Boyle v. United Technologies Corp. decision goes well beyond the narrow issue of the tort liability of defense contractors. The court held that the estate of a Marine pilot killed in a Sikorsky helicopter accident couldn't sue the manufacturer for alleged design defects if the product was built according to government design.    The most important part of Justice Scalia's opinion was recognizing that sometimes black-and-white legal concepts must yield to more important considerations. One is government discretion, especially the freedom of action needed to make trade-offs. &quot;The selection of the appropriate design for military equipment to be used by our armed forces,&quot; Justice Scalia wrote for the court, &quot;often involves not merely engineering analysis but judgment as to the balancing of many technical, military, and even social considerations, including specifically the trade-off between greater safety and greater combat effectiveness.&quot;    Ever since the huge Agent Orange settlement, extending the liability explosion to the deep-pocket Pentagon and its suppliers has been a top priority for plaintiff lawyers. Now, however, the competing interest of an effective national defense has taken precedence over a tort case, and perhaps some day soon the courts will recognize the social utility of vaccines, playgrounds and ladders to defeat frivolous lawsuits.    The current impulse to apply domestic law to all manner of national security and foreign policy issues is a troubling innovation. One of the largest defects of the Iran-Contra affair is that it criminalized policy differences, oblivious to the deadening effect this would have on intelligence and military officers, who now watch some of their best and brightest face possible jail for pursuing the policies of their commander in chief. The Pentagon procurement &quot;scandal&quot; threatens weapons systems while all wait for up to six months for the prosecutor to reveal the actual allegations. Again, the system in these instances appears to be saying that any effort at balancing or judgment has to give way to retribution in the courts.    President Reagan has belatedly corrected one egregious breakdown of prosecutorial judgment by announcing that from now on prosecutors must get higher-level approval before indicting a foreign head of state. A federal prosecutor didn't bother to ask any high-ranking executive-branch officials before indicting Panama's Manuel Noriega. He indicted without worrying about any &quot;factors extraneous to law enforcement.&quot; Prosecutors, however, are not appointed to make foreign policy.    Competing interests must always vie with the desire some have to expand the imperialism of legal rules. Ironically, by pushing so hard against the envelope of the legal system, agitators in fields as diverse as the tort crisis and the Iran-Contra case have helped establish that there are indeed limits to the law that we ignore only at our great peril. </TEXT></DOC>
