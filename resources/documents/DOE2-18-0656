The Elk Hills Field is presently producing oil and gas fromfive geologic zones. These zones contain a number of separate and geologicallycomplex reservoirs. Considerable field development and production ofoil and gas have occurred since initial estimates of reserves were made.Total cumulative field production through December 1987 is 850 MMBblsof oil, 1.2 Tcf of gas and 648.2 MMBbls of water. In December 1987, fieldproducing rates expressed on a calendar day basis amounted to 110,364BOPD, 350,946 Mcfd and 230,179 BWPD from 1157 producers. In addition,a total of two reservoirs have gas injection in progress and four reservoirshave water injection in progress and four reservoirs have water injectionin progress. Cumulative gas and water injection amounted to 586 Bcf ofgas and 330 MMB of water. December 1987 gas and water injection ratesamounted to 174 MMcfd and 234 MBWPD, into 129 injectors. In addition,a steamflood pilot program is currently active in the Eastern ShallowOil Zone. Jerry R. Bergeson and Associates, Inc. (Bergeson) has completedPhase II of the Reservoir Analysis, Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 1,Elk Hills Oilfield, California. The objectives for this phase of thestudy included the establishment of revised estimates of the originaloil and gas-in-place for each of the zones/reservoirs, estimation ofthe remaining proved developed, proved undeveloped, probable and possiblereserves, and assessment of the effects of historical development andproduction operations and practices on recoverable reserves. 28 figs.,37 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
