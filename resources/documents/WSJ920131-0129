Jaeger, chairman and chiefexecutive officer.   The glass optical-fiber manufacturer's net was about $1.1million, or 18 cents to 20 cents a share, on revenue of about$4.7 million, Dr. Jaeger said in an interview. In theyear-earlier quarter, net was $525,000, or 11 cents a share,on revenue of $3.34 million.</LP><TEXT>   SpecTran's main product -- 2.2-kilometer spools ofhair-thin glass strand -- is weaved into cables that are usedto transmit telephone and high-speed data communications.That market, dominated by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.and Corning Inc., is still strong despite continued weaknessin the economy, Dr. Jaeger said.   But Dr. Jaeger said that he has kept down expenses andhiring as a precaution. &quot;People are still buying because it'scosteffective to invest in fiber,&quot; he said. SpecTran'scurrent two-year backlog stands at $30 million, and it nowemploys 125 people.   For the year, SpecTran expects to report net of about $3.1million, or 55 cents to 57 cents a share, on revenue of $16.3million, Dr. Jaeger said. In 1990, net was $984,000, or 21cents a share, on revenue of $10.5 million.   SpecTran's results in 1991 topped the company's best year,1985, when it reported revenue of $15.2 million. But salescollapsed suddenly in 1986 as competitors boosted capacity,Dr. Jaeger said, and revenue plunged to $3.6 million,yielding a loss of $16 million in 1986. The work force fellfrom its peak of 300 that year to a low of 45 in 1987, andthe stock, which had traded as high as $28 in 1985, traded aslow as 25 cents two years later. It closed Thursday at $19,down $1, in over-the-counter trading.   SpecTran specializes in multimode fiber, that transmitlight waves generated by diodes instead of lasers, thetypical method used in the more common singlemode fiber usedin long-distance telephone communications. After ATandamp;T andCorning, SpecTran is the No. 3 maker of multi-mode fiber, amarket that has limited competition because the ATandamp;T andCorning patents are so broad, Dr. Jaeger said. SpecTran holdsproduct and process patent licenses from both companies.   In addition to being licensors, ATandamp;T and Corning have beenboth major buyers and competitors of SpecTran. &quot;It's abalancing act,&quot; Dr. Jaeger said of his relationship to thelarger companies, which have turned to SpecTran to fillorders that exceeded their capacity.</TEXT></DOC>
