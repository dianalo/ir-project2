The new law is one of three Iran-Contra related measuresCongress sent to Bush at the end of this year's legislativesession. Bush now has signed two, and is expected to approve thethird, even though his administration believes the bills placeunwarranted restrictions on its foreign policy activities.   Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to theoversight posts at other government agencies that review federalprograms and seek to ferret out abuses, was part of a broader billauthorizing U.S. intelligence activities for the coming year.   While the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret, itreportedly involves between $25 billion and $30 billion forintelligence collection and analysis, upgraded spy satellites andother hardware, and covert operations overseas.   In a statement, Bush said the new inspector general post ``couldimpair the ability of the CIA to collect vitally neededintelligence information by creating a perception thatconfidentiality cannot be guaranteed.''   To secure cooperation, the CIA ``must be able to assure foreignindividuals and organizations that their identities, the fact oftheir association with the United States, and the information theyprovide are not subject to expoure,'' added Bush, himself a formerCIA director.   A day earlier, CIA Director William Webster said while theprovision could damage confidence of foreign intelligence servicesin U.S. ability to keep secrets, he would seek to rebuildsafeguards against compromising intelligence sources and methods.   ``If it becomes law, we will do our best to make it work,''Webster said.   Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision thatwould let the CIA director kill any inspector general'sinvestigation he believed might compromise national securityinterests.   He vowed he ``will resist any attempt by the intelligencecommittees to micromanage the CIA through the vehicle of astatutory inspector general.''   The new inspector general would be appointed by the presidentand confirmed by the Senate, and the auditor's reports would beavailable to the House and Senate committees that oversee U.S.intelligence.   Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by theCIA director and reports only to him. That arrangement has causedfriction with the House Intelligence Committee, which has beendenied access to some reports.   Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandalsaid the agency's inspector general lacked independence and didn'thave ``the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncoverarms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits toNicaragua's Contra rebels.   The implication was that as an underling of former CIA DirectorWilliam Casey, who was deeply involved in the affair, the inspectorgeneral lacked the muscle to detect or report on Iran-Contra abuses.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contrainvestigating panel, said Bush's acceptance of the new inspectorgeneral provision was ``not easy for him to do. It represents aconcession on the part of the president, a deference to thecongressional sensitivity on this.''   The bill also keeps on track a multibillion-dollar program toupgrade the nation's intelligence collection through so-called``national technical means,'' or satellites and other electronicspying.   The program apparently doubles the rate at which the governmentwill be launching Lacrosse radar satellites, which orbit about 400miles up and can penetrate darkness and cloud cover to takehigh-resolution pictures of the Earth, said John Pike of theFederation of American Scientists.   Impetus for the buildup began with U.S. ratification of theintermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the SovietUnion, which brought new requirements for verification, and hasbeen given additional urgency by the likelihood of new strategicand convention arms control treaties with the Soviets in the comingmonths.   Last week, Bush signed a foreign aid bill that includes awarning against using U.S. aid money as a ``leverage'' to inducerecipients to carry out American policy goals that otherwise wouldbe forbidden by U.S. law. The provision is a reaction to PresidentReagan's apparent use of aid money as a reward to Honduras forharboring the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in its territory along theNicaraguan border.   Still pending, but expected to be signed by Bush, is a bill thatwould impose criminal penalties on any official who permits salesof restricted arms to terrorist countries, a list that now includesSyria, Libya, Iran, North Korea, South Yemen and Cuba. The measureseeks to eliminate loopholes like the ones that permitted thearms-for-hostages deal with Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
