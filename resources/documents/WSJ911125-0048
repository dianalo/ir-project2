Even the Soviet coup plotters shunned the labelMarxist. Yet Karl Marx influences modern views of history andeconomics.   Millions prefer mood-altering drugs such as Valium andProzac to psychotherapy. Yet current research into theworkings of the mind flows from ideas developed by SigmundFreud.   Physicists' explorations of the origin of the universehave placed theories of relativity under siege. Yet AlbertEinstein's work underpins much of modern physics, having wellwithstood the same question that others ask about Marx andFreud:   Was he right?   Perhaps more than any others among history's greatthinkers, Marx, Freud and Einstein have shaped our century,now in its final decade. All were born in the 1800s, and onlyEinstein did his major work during any of our lifetimes. Yettheir ideas were so startling and far-reaching they haveentered the popular consciousness in ways hat virtuallydefine what we mean by &quot;modern.&quot; They undermined the dogmasof their times and, in doing so, created new ones for ours.Even now, their names generate heated controversy across aspectrum ranging from religious fundamentalists to thescientific avant-garde.   Having shaped the 20th century, how likely are they tohelp shape the 21st?   The tumultuous events of the past two years -- above all,the collapse of communism in many countries -- have sentMarxists scurrying for cover. None of the great thinkers hasbeen so thoroughly discredited as Marx -- at least so itwould seem. Marxism as politicized and implemented byVladimir Lenin appears moribund.   But even as the newly liberated peoples of Eastern Europeand the Soviet Union celebrate Marx's apparent eclipse,others are finding fresh insights in his work. For Marx'srevolutionary analysis concentrated almost exclusively oncapitalism, not socialism, and even now, severe abuses canspring from unbridled capitalism.   Ideas traceable back to Marx's work echo through currenteconomic and social debate in capitalist countries such asthe U.S., Canada and the nations of Western Europe. In suchplaces, politicians and social commentators don't go aroundquoting Marx, of course. But they often battle over issuesthat weren't widely recognized as issues until he came along.A few examples of his subtle influence:   -- Social welfare. Marx wanted to redress growingdisparities between rich and poor. Today, many Americanpoliticians, especially Democrats, are planning campaignthemes deploring the financial gains of the wealthy andpushing for further moves to redistribute income.   -- The environmental movement. Marx predicted thatunregulated self-interest would lead to socially undesirableresults. For example, he complained about the pollution ofthe River Thames in much the same way that people todaycomplain about the waterways around Boston. And he did so ata time when few people thought about environmental problems.   -- Securities-law enforcement. Marx predicted thatwide-open competition would erode society's moral fabric,producing alienated individuals interested only in their owngain. In Wall Street's recent scandals, some see the greedthat Marx had decried long ago.   Even the Communists' problems can be viewed as a strangevariant of Marxist thinking. Marx expected progress to comethrough sweeping social change, punctuated by revolutionaryupheavals. He predicted the collapse of capitalism, but,ironically, his analysis can be applied in some ways to theamazing disintegration of Communist governments, regimesbuilt on the foundation of his own thinking but not accordingto his specifications.   &quot;Marx wrote almost nothing about socialism or communism,&quot;says Samuel Bowles, a Marxist economist at the University ofMassachusetts. So nothing in recent events causes Prof.Bowles to shun the Marxist label. &quot;The main upshot of eventsin Eastern Europe was the collapse of public ownership of themeans of production,&quot; he observes. &quot;So, there's a lot ofrethinking about socialist economies but little aboutcapitalist economies.&quot;   Non-Marxist economists generally agree. They note, forexample, that Marx's own writings never even mention centralplanning. Marx was a utopian who more or less assumed thatonce socialism had supplanted capitalism, many of the world'sproblems would evaporate. He was, says Allan Meltzer, aCarnegie Mellon economist, afflicted with the &quot;liberaldelusion&quot; that all society needs is &quot;to get good people inpower to achieve good results.&quot;   Marx's concentration on capitalism, Philip Mirowski of theUniversity of Notre Dame says, &quot;explains the hyphens,&quot; theway people discuss not Marxist ideas so much asMarxist-Leninist ideas. Lenin, not Marx, devised a Communistsystem.   In many ways, however, Marx's own work has colored Westernthinking. Michael Novak of the American Enterprise Institutenotes that &quot;dictionary definitions of capitalism are almostall taken from Marx&quot;; they emphasize ownership of the meansof production and neglect the entrepreneur's crucialinnovative role. And in many Western universities, Prof.Mirowski says, Marxism remains &quot;an important cultural force,&quot;not so much among economists but in departments such asliterature and social history.   Nor has the collapse of communism in many countries sweptaway the Marxist-inspired ideological roadblocks to change.People in such countries talk about instituting a marketeconomy but don't understand it. They still oppose privateproperty, disparage profit as simply robbery and want no oneto earn any more than anyone else.   Many hard-line Communists are unswayed. NikolaiPetrushenko, a member of the Soviet parliament, still thinks&quot;the future belongs&quot; to the Communist Party despite itsrecent abolition. When the Baltic states first turnedrebellious, his view was typically Marxist: He saw the drivefor independence as &quot;the first protest of the workers of theU.S.S.R. against privatization and the appearance of privatebusiness.&quot; Even now, he remains &quot;a devotee&quot; of Communistideals and says, &quot;I spend my evenings reading Marx andEngels.&quot;   In China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba, Communists facemajor problems but still hold sway. Peru is besieged byMaoist guerrillas. And in various places in Latin America,some Catholic priests who advocate &quot;liberation theology&quot;still see the world in terms of class struggle.   In a working-class fringe of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Rev.Fernando Altemeyer, a young priest trained at his seminary inMarxist analysis, rises at 4 a.m. to hand out copies of acomic &quot;newspaper&quot; to employees arriving at a metalworkingplant. In the comic strip, called &quot;The Anthill,&quot; the ants arethe workers. As they struggle to win a better life, a gianthand labeled &quot;class consciousness&quot; points the way.   Marx's work also remains influential as a system ofintellectual analysis. It &quot;remains immediate andindispensable, although many details of his explanation havebeen proved wrong,&quot; Robert Heilbroner wrote in his book&quot;Marxism, For and Against.&quot; Like Plato and Freud, Marxinvented a mode of inquiry designed to reach a reality buried&quot;beneath the surface of history,&quot; added Mr. Heilbroner, aprofessor at the New School for Social Research in New York.&quot;Marx's combination of insight and method permanently alteredthe manner in which reality would thereafter be perceived.&quot;   He did so partly by asking very sharp questions and partlyby offering very original answers. The pre-eminent example ofhis originality is his economic interpretation of history,the theory, in his own words, that &quot;the mode of production inmaterial life determines the general character of the social,political and spiritual processes of life.&quot; It's difficult tofind strong precedent for his idea that the techniques ofproduction and relationships of exchange set the whole socialagenda.   Marx also is extraordinary in that &quot;very few thinkers inhistory&quot; had so much impact, says Daniel T. Rodgers, aprofessor of American intellectual history at Princeton. &quot;Thesocialists and Communists used his work as texts.&quot;   John Kenneth Galbraith has observed that earlier radicalshad criticized capitalism but that Marx's &quot;work carried anauthority and conviction that was incomparably greater thanany of his socialist predecessors'.&quot; It thereby significantlystrengthened the socialist argument -- bolstering not onlyself-proclaimed socialist governments but also the world-widetrend toward government intervention in national economies,including that in the U.S.   But Marx's work played a curiously meager role in theRussian revolution. Paul Johnson, the British historian,calls Lenin an opportunist who &quot;completely ignored the verycore of Marx's ideology, the historical determinism of therevolution.&quot; Instead, Mr. Johnson says, Lenin believed that&quot;the decisive role was played by human will: his.&quot; TheChinese Communists didn't follow Marx's script, either.   Nevertheless, can Marx, who sometimes did suggest imposingthe new order by force, be blamed for Communisttotalitarianism? Can a visionary be held responsible for hisfollowers' actions many years later? Christianity and otherreligions raise the same question. Would the Man who gave theSermon on the Mount really have favored the SpanishInquisition?   Like his contemporary, Charles Dickens, Marxunquestionably felt deep sympathy for the poor. For onething, he and his wife, who had five children, were poorthemselves. More important, working conditions in his timewere horrendous.   In &quot;Das Kapital,&quot; his three-volume masterpiece, Marx citesBritish medical and factory-inspector reports at length. Hequotes, for example, a magistrate in Nottingham in 1860:&quot;Children of nine or 10 years are dragged from their squalidbeds at two, three or four o'clock in the morning andcompelled to work for bare subsistence until 10, 11 or 12 atnight.&quot; Marx also cites a seven-year-old boy who worked 16hours a day making paper-hangings and whose father testified,&quot;I have often knelt down to feed him as he stood by themachine, for he could not leave it or stop.&quot; Conditions inBritish mines, for women as well as men, were even moreappalling.   Marx himself was deeply involved in political plottingever since chafing under repressive governments in his nativeGermany. He was further angered by the abuses in England, hisadopted home, and campaigned for many reforms that few wouldnow oppose. He favored, for example, limits on the workingday and rules promoting factory safety. He complained aboutadulteration of bread in London.   But most of all, he complained about the wholecapitalistic system, and, as a critic, he was formidable.Studying year after year in the library of the British Museumin London, he became undoubtedly the world's leadingauthority on the history of economic thought. He also was, asProf. Heilbroner in &quot;The Worldly Philosophers&quot; puts it, &quot;theGerman scholar par excellence, slow, meticulous, andpainstakingly, even morbidly, perfectionist.&quot;   Marx, an angry and often irascible man, also was a bornanalyst, so much so that his endless analyzing got in the wayof his efforts to convert his extensive notes into books.Volume I of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; came out in 1867, after 18 years ofwork; the other two volumes had to be finished by FriedrichEngels, his friend and collaborator, after Marx died in 1883.   Marx relentlessly dissected capitalism, beginning with themost basic transactions, then ferreting out its problems andpredicting its collapse. Although he never set forth aprecise, disaster-by-disaster forecast of how the collapsewould occur, he expected capitalism to be wrecked by its owninternal contradictions, by the very forces that had kept itgoing. Among other problems, he said, harsh competition,combined with the introduction of more and more productivemachinery, would eventually cause a disastrous drop inprofits. He also predicted, more vaguely, that workers wouldbecome ever more miserable -- and ever more likely to revolt.   None of these predictions has been borne out. In the 1920sand 1930s, Princeton's Prof. Rodgers explains, the success offascism &quot;didn't fit&quot; Marx's theories. So most historiansconcluded, in contradiction to Marx's writings, that not justeconomic forces but culture, ideas, nationalism and even merepolitical maneuvering do matter -- a lot. Nationalism, forexample, has undermined international proletarian movements,and big changes in a nation's development can stem fromnothing more than some politician's whim.   Although crude economic determinism has been discarded,Marx's work indirectly retains a lot of clout. Today, Prof.Rodgers says, &quot;neo-Marxism has a very powerful influence&quot; onhistorical research through its emphasis on &quot;the effect ofclass relations on history.&quot; It studies &quot;the differencesamong classes, not just rich and poor, but their integrationinto systems of production and changes in class structure. .. . It's an analytical tool that is virtually everyone's.&quot;   It most influences social historians, says Lloyd Gardner,a Rutgers professor of American diplomatic history, &quot;becauseof the nature of the groups that they study. If you arestudying the labor movement, for example, you are predisposedin that direction.&quot; But it indirectly influences evendiplomatic historians. Stanford's Barton Bernstein cites theubiquitous argument that business interests strongly affectAmerican foreign policy.   For most economic thinkers much as for most historians,Marx is too outdated to follow but too important to ignore.   Stephen Marglin, a self-described &quot;eclectic&quot; at Harvard,emphasizes Marx's pioneering views on labor. Marx, he says,broke new ground by recognizing that &quot;labor is fundamentallydifferent from other commodities. Unlike when you buy anorange, when you hire a worker, you then have to get the workout of the worker. And the worker has his own agenda.&quot;   Among Marx's other contributions to economics, Prof.Marglin lists his &quot;emphasis on accumulation -- the process ofinvestment and building up the capital stock&quot;; his&quot;insistence on instability and the evolutionary process ofwhich capitalism is a part&quot;; his work on &quot;the relationship ofcapitalism to politics, the legal system, cultural trends,etc.&quot;; and his idea &quot;that classes built around economicinterests are essential to understanding how the economyworks and changes.&quot;   By forcefully calling attention to such trends, Marxraised important questions earlier economists had slightedbut subsequent economists could no longer avoid.   One example: In rejecting Say's law -- the dictum thatsupply creates its own demand -- and with it the classicaleconomists' assumption of an inherent tendency toward fullemployment, Marx pushed the problem of economic slumps tocenter stage. Although he didn't devise an integrated theoryof business cycles, he offered a wide variety of explanationsthat stimulated -- and, especially during bad times, stillstimulate -- economic inquiry.   Moreover, Prof. Bowles says, &quot;Many of Marx's predictionswere right: the rise of large-scale industry, theconcentration of power and control, the dynamic role oftechnology.&quot;   But Marx &quot;underestimated the capacity of the system toreform itself,&quot; Prof. Marglin says. &quot;The capitalism of todayis far different from the capitalism of Marx's time.&quot;Specifically, Marx underestimated how government, spurred bypolitical competition (especially after workers got thevote), could help the poor.   &quot;Marx clearly did not anticipate the vast extension of thestate into the sphere of business enterprise by means ofregulation, public ownership, the increasing socialization ofcapital and the national income by taxation, and thefunneling of savings and governmental treasuries in order toprovide for collective wants,&quot; wrote the late Leo Rogin, aneconomist at the University of California at Berkeley.   Despite his own emphasis on technological change, Marxalso didn't fully appreciate the tremendous outpouring ofwealth due to modern machinery, assembly-line production andcheap railroad transportation. Nor did he anticipate theclear implications for workers' standard of living despiteobvious gains all over Europe.   &quot;Marx missed a great deal with regard to how wellcapitalism would serve the workers,&quot; says John Roemer of theUniversity of California at Davis. Workers have become moreeager to share the fruits of the system than overthrow it,more bourgeois than bent on revolution.   Marx's slighting of the changes around him was especiallydamaging because of his analytical approach. He didn't viewcapitalism as marred merely by greed; he advanced a far morefundamental -- and far more forceful -- argument. Hepostulated an ideal, perfectly competitive capitalism andargued even such a system was inherently evil and inevitablydoomed.   But in assuming perfect competition, Marx assumed away thepossibility that an imperfectly competitive system mighttemper the rigors of pure capitalism. Capitalists might notneed to beat every last ounce of work out of workers to stayin business. And if the imperfections included unions,workers would benefit from their increased bargaining power.   To a great extent, Marx the analytical genius was led downa byway by Marx the revolutionary agitator. In adoptingclassical economists' labor theory of value -- the theorythat the value of all products is determined by the amount oflabor ordinarily required to produce them -- Marx renderedmuch of his work obsolete. Wassily Leontief of New YorkUniversity says Marx knew &quot;that actual prices of goods arenot proportional&quot; to the labor embodied in them, but thetheory &quot;had a very strong political purpose&quot; -- to proveexploitation.   Marx's theories have aged in other ways, too. For example,he emphasized the distribution of property rather than ofincome and generally argued as if the family firms typical ofthe 19th century would remain the dominant economic force.   &quot;Marx made a serious error in arguing that ownershipalways implied control,&quot; Prof. Marglin says. &quot;We have a wholenew managerial class that didn't exist years ago.&quot; Prof.Mirowski adds: &quot;The existence of the modern corporation is areal problem for Marx. Corporations aren't real players inhis {economic} model.&quot;   Acknowledging such problems, even most Marxists concedethat much of Marx is outdated. He would have to do a lot ofrethinking, Prof. Bowles says, especially in light of &quot;thelong postwar boom and its dramatically rising livingstandards.&quot; s   And Prof. Heilbroner, a self-described eclectic, says Marx&quot;was a passionate democrat, a supporter of the bottom ofsociety, but not a supporter of democratic procedures. Hispassion was directed to one socioeconomic level of society.&quot;Consequently, Marx ignored the importance of a framework oflaws. Prof. Bowles says Marx thus &quot;overlooked the dictatorialpotential of the state. . . . That was a huge mistake.&quot;   In a general way, however, Marx's views still carryenormous weight and almost surely will do so well into thenext century. His concern for ordinary workers and his beliefthat the government should look after them will continue toecho through economic and political discourse. Few peoplewant a return to unbridled capitalism; even ardent freemarketers say some government intervention into economicaffairs is necessary. The debate now is over what kind andhow much.   Prof. Heilbroner says Marx is and will remain &quot;the greatphilosophical economist of capitalism.&quot; In the realm ofideas, the professor adds, Marx's &quot;understanding ofcapitalism is what Freud is to psychology,&quot; and Marx &quot;willcontinue to be a source, just as Adam Smith is a source.&quot;   ---                                                                                                          Karl Heinrich Marx was one of the world's most influentialeconomists. He developed the idea of economic determinism,profoundly affected the socialist movement and thus history,and remains a seminal thinker to this day.
