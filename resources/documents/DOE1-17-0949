<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0949 </DOCNO><TEXT>The nuclei /sup 155/Gd, /sup 161/Dy and /sup 163/Dy have been investigatedby means of the (n, {gamma}), (n, e) and transfer reactions. Level schemeshave been constructed up to about 1.5 MeV, which include spin and parityassignements for many levels. New rotatinal bands based on single particlestates (Nilsson) as well as on vibrational states have been identified.The results are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
