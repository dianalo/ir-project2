(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The war over Saturday car sales in theheart of the nation's automaking industry is opening up again withshotgun blasts and shattered windows.   Leo Jerome's suburban Detroit Oldsmobile and Nissan dealershiplost two 7-by-4 foot panes, apparently for opening on the weekend.   ``I would either say it's a couple of (competing) salespeoplewho took it in their own hands or they hired somebody,'' Jeromesaid Tuesday. ``In Detroit, you can hire something done pretty easywith the right contacts.''   The Saturday opening controversy has been bubbling in Detroitfor 20 years, and there have been several reports of vandalism.   Jerome said his business received a telephone call last week. Hequoted a male voice as saying, ``Other salesmen are excited. It'sstarting off with a bang. Measure your glass.''   His dealership has been open on weekends intermittently inrecent years, closing each time after incidents of violence orharassment, he said. ``We come out and retreat,'' he said.   He resumed the Saturday hours about six months ago, but didn'tbegin advertising the weekend hours until a month ago.   ``It's getting around that it wasn't a short-term deal,'' hesaid. ``We're going to sell cars, even if (other dealerships) arenot. They didn't like that.''   The Detroit Auto Dealers Association has taken no formal standon the Saturday sales issue, said DADA Executive Vice President DanHayes. He said he didn't know how many of the association'sapproximately 240 members are open on weekends but said those werein a small minority.   Jerome said Detroit is the only major market he knows of wheredealerships are closed Saturdays.   ``I'm not trying to be a hero,'' said Jerome, who opened KeyMotor Mall in 1965. ``I'm not overjoyed to pay for glass. I'm nottrying to be a cause, either.''   But Jerome said his business needs all the help it can get.   ``To cover my overhead, I'll do anything it takes to sell acar,'' he said.   Jerome estimated that car sales on a normal Saturday amount toabout half of any single weekday's sales. But a few good Saturdaysin a row can turn loss into profit.   ``If we can pick up a half-dozen (sales) a weekend, that's 25 amonth, it can be a difference between us being profitable or beingat a loss,'' Jerome said.   Key employees reporting to work Thursday found two shatteredglass panes and two others riddled with birdshot. Police discoveredevidence that five or six shots had been fired.   No one was injured and no one, including the dealership'sovernight security guards, heard shots, Jerome said. The guardswere at the back of the property, keeping an eye on the 300 carsJerome keeps in stock.   In 1981 and 1982, Jerome said, cars on his lot suffered about$300,000 in damage caused by vandalism, ranging from interiorsbeing set on fire to body paint being badly scratched.   No one has been arrested in any of the incidents.   Last July, in Washington, Administrative Law Judge James Timonyof the Federal Trade Commission turned aside government chargesthat Detroit auto dealers illegally conspired to close showrooms onweekends and most weeknights.   Timony said the agreement to limit hours stemmed from a labordispute dating to 1959, when dealers agreed to close on weekends tokeep salesmen from joining labor organizations in the heavilyunionized Detroit area. Since it was a labor dispute, the judgesaid, it was exempt from antitrust action.   A veteran salesman at another Detroit-area dealership that isclosed on weekends said most weekend customers are ``tire kickers''interested mainly in browsing.   ``When I first got in this business (in 1967), we were open onSaturdays and, quite frankly, business was pretty good,'' JohnHillman said from Bill Brown Ford in Livonia. ``Then it just died.   ``We said to each other, `Hey, guys, we're not paid by the hour.We just sit here and talk to each other. It's kind of silly,'''Hillman said.   Hillman said Bill Brown Ford closed on weekends after he andother salespeople picketed to protest weekend hours.   ``I like spending time with my family. If they went to a six-daywork week, I'd quite frankly look for another line of work,'' saidHillman.</TEXT></DOC>
