Thousands of Americans are receiving letters from AmbassadorP.G.J. Koornhof, along with a questionnaire and a reprint of aReader's Digest article arguing against U.S. economic sanctions onSouth Africa.   ``What is your opinion of the South African government's reformsto eliminate apartheid?'' is one of the 12 questions.   Another one asks: ``In your opinion, will punitive U.S.sanctions promote positive political change in South Africa?''   Then there is this one: A recent editorial ``concluded thatsanctions against South Africa have increased U.S. dependence onthe Soviet Union for strategic minerals. Does this concern you?''   ``This is routine activity for the press section,'' said DelareyVan Tonder, the embassy's press and information counselor. ``We tryto keep our mailing list updated.''   The questionnaire also asks respondents whether they would likemore information about South Africa, divided into four categories:social, labor, business and political. ``We try to provideobjective and balanced information about our country'' when peopleindicate an interest, Van Tonder said.   South Africa and the United States ``share the ideals ofdemocracy and freedom,'' Koornhof's letter said, noting that bothare committed to a free market economic system.   ``We have both confronted the bitter legacy of racism,segregation and racial segregation in our societies. Like theUnited States, we are working to correct the mistakes andinjustices of our past,'' the letter said.   Several thousand letters have gone out in recent months toacademics, politicians, business people and public figures, he said.   ``Your opinion is important to me, to my government and to SouthAfricans _ black and white _ who are striving to build a truly openand democratic society in South Africa,'' Koornhof wrote.   Koornhof noted that while he has ``not been surprised to find acertain amount of hostility and antagonism toward South Africa'' hehas also found ``a considerable reservoir of good will.''   The hostility is based ``upon the widely held misperception thatmy government remains committed to preserving apartheid,'' he said.``This is not true'' as evidenced by the abolition of more than 50discriminatory measures since 1980, Koornhof said.   The newly elected government of South Africa, headed byPresident F.W. de Klerk, is advocating reform that would grant thecountry's black majority more freedom but would stop short ofgiving them the right to vote.   Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for AfricanAffairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesdaythat events in South Africa are sufficiently encouraging topreclude additional U.S. economic sanctions ``at the presenttime.'' But in a shift from the position of the Reaganadministration, Cohen did not rule out sanctions if additionalprogress is not made by next June in bringing about power-sharingtalks between blacks and whites.   ``If, after the next parliamentary session (next June) there isvery little to show for it,'' Cohen said, the administration willconsult with its foreign allies and with Congress about whatsanctions are appropriate.   External and internal pressures are helping convince the SouthAfrican government that it must ``move beyond its current positionand accept fundamental change,'' he said.   And in an admission never made by officials of the Reaganadministration, Cohen added that the sanctions imposed by Congressin 1986 despite a veto by President Reagan ``have played a role instimulating new thinking within the white power structure.''</TEXT></DOC>
