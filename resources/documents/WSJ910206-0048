The American Society of Corporate Secretaries complainedthat the commission too frequently allows social questions tobe debated at annual meetings. Shareholders &quot;use the proxyprocess because they can't use the political process,&quot; saidDonald Fried, the group's vice president and associategeneral counsel. &quot;They are using the shareholder proxyprocess for social change.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Fried argued that many issues aren't appropriate forholders to decide, such as whether a company advertises inPenthouse or Playboy magazines, contributes to a senatorialcampaign or uses animals in tests. He said that last year, ina reversal of SEC policy, holders were allowed to vote ontobacco-related resolutions for the first time.   Moreover, Mr. Fried, corporate secretary at Philip MorrisCos., argued that the agency hasn't clearly set standards forhow to decide whether to permit debate on such questions atthe meetings.   The debate comes at a time when the commission is studyingchanges to proxy rules. In the next year or so, it is likelyto propose revisions to the way proxy statements are written,how proxy votes are solicited and what needs to be reportedby management.</TEXT></DOC>
