Loud cheers and hoots from the partisan crowd.   A week later, Dukakis was in Chicago to deliver an address onhis view of U.S.-Soviet relations, the kind of speech aides werequick to describe as ``major.''   Early on, he questioned Republican nominee George Bush'sjudgment with this example:   ``If he truly believes that J. Danforth Quayle is qualified tobe one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust hisjudgment when America's future is on the line.''   Dukakis campaign aides make no secret they are convinced Quayle,the junior senator from Indiana, is a major liability to Bush asthe GOP vice presidential nominee.   Certainly, polls show that most voters think Dukakis' runningmate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, is far more qualified to succeed tothe presidency than Quayle.   But those same polls also show Bush gaining, not losing, groundsince he picked Quayle.   That phenomenon can be explained by a number of factorsunrelated to Quayle.   The big early Dukakis lead was illusory, based as it was onpolls taken before voters were giving a moment's thought to the twocandidates.   More important was how Dukakis dealt with his perceived setbackin his campaign to capture the White House.   His first reaction was to heat up his rhetoric. But the targetwas more often Quayle than Bush.   But as tempting a target as Quayle might be, when Dukakisattacks him, the Democratic presidential nominee is in the positionof spending a lot of time running against the GOP vice presidentialcandidate.   It's the political equivalent of kicking a small dog. The doggets all the sympathy even when he sinks his teeth into thekicker's ankle.   When Bentsen kicks Quayle, that's a fair fight. Or when otherDemocratic senators take jabs at their GOP colleague that too iseffective.   Dukakis has as great a dilemma and fewer options on the otherprincipal target of his stump speeches _ Ronald Reagan.   Twice now _ in 1980 and 1984 _ the Democrats took their bestshots at Reagan. The total score was Reagan 93 states, Jimmy Carterand Walter Mondale 7.   When the 1988 campaign started, the big question was how Bush,Reagan's impeccably loyal vice president, could separate himselffrom the president. How could the vice president establish his ownidentity while refusing to express the slightest disagreement withReagan policies?   The question was asked and asked again. Who was George Bush?What did he stand for?   Bush agreed it was a problem, but said he thought he'd overcomeit.   With a carefully staged convention and Reagan's fullcooperation, Bush did just that. He emerged from New Orleans with anew public image. As his strategists had hoped, Bush suddenly wasperceived as the Republican presidential nominee, no longer asReagan's vice president.   The Reagan problem may now have shifted.   It's possible that Dukakis is now the candidate having troubleseparating himself from Reagan.   When the Democratic nominee wants to attack the record of thepast seven and a half years, he is doing what Democrats had hopedthey would never again have to endure _ he is campaigning againstRonald Reagan.   There is no easy way out of that dilemma.   To win, Dukakis must convince voters that it's time for asubstantive change whether they agreed or not with the policies ofthe Reagan years.   That's not an easy case to make when most economic statisticsare favorable and the outgoing president remains very popular.   Twenty-eight years ago, John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M.Nixon. But the country had just been through a recession and theU-2 incident had led to a sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.   Dukakis may pull it off. But Reagan and Quayle are not his besttargets.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE - Donald M. Rothberg is the chief political</HEAD><TEXT>   writer of The Associated Press.</TEXT><TEXT/></DOC>
