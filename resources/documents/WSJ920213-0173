Hints of restiveness within the army are particularlytroubling to Bush administration aides, who think Russianofficers are unhappy over the military's economic plight andloss of status. U.S. officials think the biggest threat toMr. Yeltsin in the next few months will come from militaryleaders who might be inspired by disgruntled and outspokenRussian Vice President Alexander Rutskoi to move against theRussian president.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. officials stop well short of predicting thatthere will be a coup attempt, and some analysts say thestrength of right-wing forces is exaggerated. Oneadministration aide noted that, in his recent visit withPresident Bush at Camp David, Mr. Yeltsin seemed confident hecould keep the military under control. Moreover, officialssaid, the administration doesn't have hard information of anymoves against Mr. Yeltsin, but merely is growing moreconcerned.   Still, Mr. Yeltsin himself warned U.S. officials duringhis visit that the period from now through April will becrucial to his survival. He said that if he fails, heprobably would be replaced by Russians with authoritarianviews, administration aides say.   The clearest warning of the risk to Mr. Yeltsin came thisweek from former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,who said in a Moscow television interview that the danger ofa coup &quot;still exists&quot; and may be &quot;even bigger&quot; now than itwas before last August's failed attempt to overthrowthen-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   &quot;The problems in the army are very large,&quot; Mr.Shevardnadze said. &quot;If there is no success in restructuringthe economy and finances in Russia and the other republics,&quot;he warned, &quot;I can say with complete certainty that in placeof today's democratic leader and democratic institutions,right {wing}, probably reactionary, politicians and powerswill appear on the political level.&quot;   Russian officials have been blunt in saying that theydon't think the humanitarian and economic aid being providedby the West, particularly the airlift begun this week by theU.S., is adequate to meet the needs of Russians for the restof the winter. Whatever alarms officials in Moscow may besounding could be designed at least partly to increase thepressure for Western aid.   Administration critics maintain that President Bush andhis aides are increasing the chances that Mr. Yeltsin willfail by refusing to send more aid. The Center for SecurityPolicy, a conservative think tank, complained this week thatthe U.S. aid effort provides &quot;little but cosmeticassistance.&quot;   U.S. officials acknowledge that the international aideffort alone isn't enough to offset the giant economicproblems Mr. Yeltsin faces. Some doubt that any outside aideffort could be big enough to overcome the hardships andshortages.   But administration aides insist they want Mr. Yeltsin tosucceed, and they say the Camp David meeting convinced themthat the Russian leader is serious about pushing ahead witheconomic and political reforms. Some officials worry that,even if military leaders find it easier to feed and housetheir troops, they could be unhappy because of the generaldecline in the armed forces' cohesion and prestige.   Vice President Rutskoi, a former army officer, recentlywrote that what is happening &quot;to us and to Russia is nothingless than the tragic history of a great country.&quot; Mr.Yeltsin, in one indication of concern, appears to be keepingintact a unit of the former KGB secret police that monitorsthe military, U.S. officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
