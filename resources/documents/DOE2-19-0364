Coal is used as the feedstock in the ACP process to obtainhydrogen for ammonia synthesis and fertilizer production. In addition,further work is defined that includes comprehensive emissions characterizationand impact analysis for a wide range of operating conditions and typesof coals which would expedite environmental planning for future coalgasification projects by TVA or others. This plan covers the environmentaland workplace safety activities already planned and budgeted for fiscalyears 1979 through 1983. These activities include characterization ofall effluent streams, preventing potential occupational exposures tohazardous agents, and workplace safety. 2 figs., 50 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
