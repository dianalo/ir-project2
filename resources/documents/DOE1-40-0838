Fluvial and debris-flowpediments on this surface contain placer concentrates that were ultimatelyderived by the repeated erosion of subcropping placers, which occur withina sequence of onlapping formations, separated by unconformities, nearthe southern margin of the basin. Autoradiographs of core drilled throughthe pediment indicate that uranium mineralization is associated withdetrital pyrite accumulations on the Eldorado paleosurface. This mineralizationoccurs as fluvial bedload concentrates that were deposited in shallowpaleochannels, and with conglomeratic diamictites. Comparison of heavymineral assemblages in crushed concentrates of the subcropping placerswith those from the Eldorado pediment, indicates that: the suite of heavyminerals is the same; all three varieties of pyrite show detrital rounding,including secondary pyrite that originally formed in situ in the olderplacers; kerogen particles appear to be rounded allogenic grains of brokencolumnar kerogen derived from erosion of older placers; uraninite isvery sparse and occurs as rare inclusions in the rounded kerogen grainsand even more rarely as free allogenic grains; there is extensive evidenceof alteration because the uranium occurs predominantly as branneriteand uraniferous leucoxene. The rarity of uraninite indicates that mostof the grains of that mineral were destroyed during reworking and exposureto the elements on a fan pediment. The destruction could have been dueto the oxidation of tetravalent uranium to hexavalent uranium by a weaklyoxidising atmosphere. (author). 15 refs, 8 figs, 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
