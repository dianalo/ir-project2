Young, chairman of CSPP and chief executive officer ofHewlett-Packard.andP;  &quot;It is not just a list of critical technologies.andP;  It givespolicy makers an understanding of how the public and private sectors cansignificantly improve U.S.andP;  competitiveness in each of these technologies.&quot;andM;The report identifies key factors within companies, as well as in theexternal business environment, that are catalysts for success in thesecritical areas.andP;  Several of these factors -- including capital investment,state-of-the art manufacturing, quality, applied research and development,basic research and skilled personnel -- strongly correlate with success inthese technologies.andM;&quot;This is the first time chief technologists from the computer-systemsindustry have worked together to identify technologies that are critical tothe computer systems industry,&quot; said Young.andM;The technologists agreed that in every technology they deemed critical, theUnited States has the ability to significantly improve its currentcompetitive position.andM;In assessing the U.S.andP;  computer industry's competitive position against therest of the world in 16 critical technologies, the technologists concludedthat the United States is maintaining its competitive lead in technologiesthat stress creativity and human factors and are not capital intensive, suchas application technologies and processor architecture.andM;They concluded that the United States is lagging in capital-intensivetechnologies such as microelectronics and ultra-large-scale-integrationfabrication equipment and facilities.andM;CSPP will work with other business and industry groups to develop a broadconsensus that cuts across technology and industry lines.andP;  For example, theCouncil on Competitiveness will apply a methodology similar to CSPP's in itscurrent examination of the competitive viability of 9 key U.S.andP;  industries,including computers.andM;&quot;While CSPP's findings are specific to the computer-systems industry, ourstudy also has important implications for other technology industries,&quot; saidYoung.andP;  &quot;In this context we are excited about participating in the Council onCompetitiveness technology project.&quot;andM;The next phase of CSPP's technology project is to identify public policiesthat can directly strengthen those success factors that impact thetechnologies critical to the U.S.andP;  computer-systems industry.andP;  By the end of1990, CSPP plans to propose to the Administration and Congress its publicpolicy recommendations.andM;The Computer Systems Policy Project, organized in 1989, is an affiliation of11 CEOs for the computer-systems industry.andP;  CSPP's long-term objective is toinform policy makers of the critical concerns facing the computer-systemsindustry and to provide ongoing information to help illuminate public policyissues.andM;CSPP members are:andM;John Sculley, Apple ComputerandM;Joseph R.
