The successful outcome of a brachytherapy treatment restsupon careful planning and the accuracy with which each step of the procedureis implemented. A slight departure for instance from proper spacing ofsources may result in 'overdosage' and necrosis within the target volumeor 'underdosage' of the tumor. The specification of a three-dimensionaltarget volume was extremely difficult before the advent of computer tomography(CT), and treatment planning and computerized dose calculation methodshave been largely limited to two-dimensional approaches. These conditionshave now been drastically changed, and a re-evaluation of dosimetry techniquesis in progress. Recent advances in diagnostic imaging methods, especiallyCT, permit the definition of both normal and neoplastic tissues in 3dimensions. Recent developments in computer display technology have createdthe tools to manage and evaluate large amounts of information, whetherdiagnostic information that describes the patient's anatomy and the targetvolume, or calculated three-dimensional dose distributions.</TEXT></DOC>
