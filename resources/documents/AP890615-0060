The students are paying for the calls with their own money andwith funds raised in recent weeks to support the pro-democracymovement, which the Chinese government is trying to crush.   One Stanford University student, who requested that his name notbe used, said he called a Beijing hot line and spoke with anoperator for 20 minutes.   ``I called and made up a lie about someone I wanted to reportlast night,'' the student said Wednesday. ``We talked for about 10minutes, then I told her it was a white lie, and we talked foranother 10 minutes.   ``I told her that there were 3,000 people killed by soldiers,that I had seen pictures and knew this from the BBC, CBS, The NewYork Times and other newspapers,'' the student continued.   ``She said if I were Chinese I would have a conscience andbelieve my own government. I said if she were a real Chinese shewould have a conscience and not report to the government on thestudents.''   He said the operator paused, then hung up.   A nationwide computer bulletin board used by Chinese universitystudents in this country lists about a dozen Beijing hot lines thatresidents of the capital are supposed to use to report thewhereabouts of known dissidents.   The bulletin board also contains numerous suggestions on how tojam the lines, thereby keeping informants from being able to usethem.   ``Some people have proposed that everyone call collect, or tocall and let it ring, then hang up,'' said Liu Dianding, a graduatestudent who has read the electronic mail at Stanford University.   Students across the United States reportedly have raised tens ofthousands of dollars in recent weeks to help support their country'spro-democracy movement. Stanford students say they have raised about$100,000.   The students say they don't know if their calls are having muchimpact, but they remain determined.   ``If we change people's minds, little by little, then one billionpeople will know the truth,'' said Liu.</TEXT></DOC>
