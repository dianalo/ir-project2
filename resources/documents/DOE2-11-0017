Detection methodsmay be divided into two classes, those with very modest performance andmight actually work, and those that promise spectacular performance butviolate the laws of physics. Emphasis in this report is on the secondclass of methods. The purpose is not to describe in detail what is possible,but to establish firm limits beyond which all schemes for detection capabilityare impossible. The last two sections of the report are for advancedstudents only and should be skipped by the non-expert. They provide precisemathematical statements and proofs of the limits the laws of physicsimpose upon neutrino cross sections. The limits are neither simple norobvious. Consequently, it may be useful to have their technical justificationhere put on record.</TEXT></DOC>
