The Primerica Co. unit cut its bonus payments far morethan the average 40% reduction at other Wall Streetsecurities firms.</LP><TEXT>   The steeper cuts are mainly because of guaranteed salariesSmith Barney forked over to some new investment bankers hiredfrom, among other places, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Drexeldeclared bankruptcy a year ago.   &quot;Those guarantees come out of the bonus pool before theypay the rest of the world,&quot; said Joan Zimmerman, executivevice president at GZ Stephens Inc., a New York executivesearch firm.   Wall Street's declining pay levels have nudged thefinancial community closer to the rest of corporate America.But bonuses account for the bulk of investment bankers' pay.Smith Barney bankers who had made a salary of, say, $100,000and a bonus of $900,000 will now make $400,000.   The Smith Barney decline was harder to swallow for someexecutives because about one-third of the bonuses were paidout in Primerica stock that is credited to employees over twoyears, not in cash. That's in line with the recent practiceof many Wall Street firms to pay bonuses partly in stock notavailable for a couple of years.   The pay plan has angered some Smith Barney bankers andtheir lawyers. Jeffrey L. Liddle, a lawyer for Liddle,O'Connor, Finkelstein andamp; Robinson in New York, which has SmithBarney clients, argues such cash-poor payouts betray peoplewho worked the entire year on the notion that they would getcash bonuses.   A Smith Barney spokesman said the firm doesn't comment &quot;onindividual compensation or compensation policies.&quot; But aperson close to the firm said the Primerica stock portion ofthe bonuses will be at a 25% discount to its market price atthe time employees collect it.</TEXT></DOC>
