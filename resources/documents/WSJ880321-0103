The plan, announced by Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, marked the government's first policy response to a yearlong investigation into a range of improprieties by industry employees.    Nukem G.m.b.H., a nuclear-services group, and its Transnuklear G.m.b.H. transport unit have been at the center of a probe into illegal shipments and storage of radioactive waste, as well as the systematic bribery of power-industry officials by waste-removal companies. The findings rekindled public anti-nuclear sentiment, forcing the pro-nuclear government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to promise tighter controls.    Mr. Toepfer said interlocking equity holdings among companies hid widespread deal-making by power-plant operators, processors of nuclear fuel and waste and operators of storage facilities. The links are to be dismantled to make the industry more easily regulated, the minister said.    The government wants the industry divided into four basic sectors: operation of nuclear power plants and recycling facilities; treatment and storage of radioactive waste; transport of radioactive waste and nuclear fuels; and production of nuclear fuel. The plan will require a shuffling of ownership structures in coming months. </TEXT></DOC>
