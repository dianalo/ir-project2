The patent was issued yesterday to Harvard University, but the exclusive rights to the technology belong to Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont Co., which was a major sponsor of the research.    Patent Commissioner Donald Quigg said the agency now is considering granting 21 other patents on genetically altered animals.    The Harvard scientists developed a technique to add cancer genes to mice embryo, creating mice that are especially susceptible to cancer. These mice then can be used more readily to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic and whether new cancer treatments are effective. In current testing, laboratory animals must be given massive doses of potential carcinogens to replicate the effect of such substances over years. &quot;This may well be the first step toward genetic engineering that will let the medical community fight against disease,&quot; said Mr. Quigg.    The decision brought a wave of protest from groups who fear the broader consequences of such developments. &quot;The whole biological kingdom is being turned on its head,&quot; said Jack Doyle, an official at the Environmental Policy Institute, a Washington-based environmental group.    Biotechnology proponents, however, assert that the new techniques merely speed up what animal breeders have been doing for centuries. &quot;Think of the Chihuahua as descended from the wolf, which shows we have been doing the best we can&quot; to create new animals, said Robert Benson, a Chicago lawyer specializing in biotechnology patents. &quot;Now we just have better technology than before.&quot;    The mice covered by the Harvard patent were developed by geneticist Philip Leder and by a former colleague, Timothy A. Stewart, now at Genentech Inc., to help investigate cancer. The mice contain certain genetic material that induces breast cancer. &quot;The mice can serve as a good model for testing (anti-cancer) therapies and diagnostic procedures,&quot; Mr. Leder said.    In Wilmington, Del., a spokesman for Du Pont said the company &quot;is making the mice available to researchers in other laboratories for a nominal fee.&quot; He added that the company has no immediate plans &quot;to build a business around the mice,&quot; but will &quot;make arrangements on a case-by-case basis with commercial laboratories planning to use the mice.&quot;    The Harvard patent &quot;is a logical extension of patent law rather than a legal breakthrough,&quot; said Lisa Raines, director of government relations for the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that micro-organisms could be patented, and in 1985, the patent office ruled that plants could be patented.    Last year, the patent office ruled that animals, excluding humans, could be patented. Mr. Quigg reiterated yesterday that the agency will not patent human beings.    However, two bills have been introduced in Congress to place a moratorium on the granting of animal patents. Debate about the patenting of animals has intensified in the past few years as scientists have improved ways of creating so-called transgenic animals, in which genes from other animals or species have been inserted. Last year, researchers with the National Institutes of Health and Integrated Genetics Inc., a Framingham, Mass.-based concern, announced that they had genetically altered mice to make the animals secrete in their milk a human drug used in treating heart attacks. Other researchers are investigating ways to genetically engineer better farm animals, such as leaner, disease-resistant cattle. </TEXT></DOC>
