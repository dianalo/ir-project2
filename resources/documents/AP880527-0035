Secord may want to question Oliver L. North about hiscongressional testimony on the subject.   To show jurors that his direction of an aid program for theNicaragua Contras was sanctioned despite a congressional ban, Northmay want to ask John M. Poindexter about his congressionalstatements on the operation.   Like his one-time business partner Secord, businessman AlbertHakim may need to use North's testimony during a trial.   Normally, a defendant can try to prove his innocence in acriminal conspiracy trial by questioning a co-defendant about hisprior statements.   But the Iran-Contra case has developed an apparentlyunprecedented legal tangle that could make it impossible for thedefendants to exercise that right.   The dilemma is so serious that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell said Thursday it may be impossible to prosecute thedefendants on the conspiracy charges that form the heart of thecase.   The testimony of defendants North, a former National SecurityCouncil staffer; Poindexter, the ex-national security adviser; andHakim was given to joint congressional committees under a grant oflimited immunity from prosecution.   Secord, a retired Air Force office, did not testify underimmunity, but he has filed legal briefs contending the immunizedtestimony of North could prove his innocence.   The immunity grant to three defendants means independent counselLawrence E. Walsh cannot use the immunized testimony against them,and he would be precluded from using it against Secord if all fourare tried together.   But left unclear Thursday was whether the defendants couldquestion each other about the congressional testimony.   ``As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try theconspiracy counts in the context'' of rules on immunity, Gesellsaid. ``If you try them together you violate the immunities.''   But Gesell added that trying the defendants separately ``makes aconspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of the other'stestimony.''   The judge said he did not want to conduct four separate trialsunder a separation motion sought by the defense. ``Four individualtrials is ridiculous,'' he said.   He added that he ``searched hard to find a case _ and I haven'tfound one _ where it's fair to say that three of four defendantshave been broadly immunized by governmental action.''   Gesell made no ruling on the immunity issue, but said he hopedto resolve the matter and other defense motions by the end of June.   The judge scheduled a closed hearing for June 13 to determine ifany lawyers for the State, Justice and Defense Departments, theWhite House and CIA used the defendants' immunized testimony toprepare officials for questioning by Walsh's grand jury.   Gesell said he wanted to determine if any of the many governmentofficials Walsh intends to call as trial witnesses were influencedby immunized statements made by the defendants.   Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge representing Walsh,said the immunity grants won't prevent a fair trial.   If Secord wants to question North about his congressionaltestimony, ``all General Secord has to do is ask Colonel North forthe same facts, and out it comes,'' Stern said.   Defense lawyer Barry Simon argued that most of the witnessesWalsh intends to call at trial were so influenced by the immunizedstatements ``you can't unscramble from what the witnesses know now,having seen, read and analyzed that testimony, from what they knewbefore.''   The four defendants are charged with conspiring to corrupt thesale of U.S. arms to Iran by diverting profits to the Contra rebelsin Nicaragua during a time when Congress banned U.S. military aidto them.   The four are also are charged with theft of government propertyand wire fraud in connection with the alleged diversion.   In addition, North and Poindexter are charged with making falsestatements and obstructing investigations by Congress and AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III into covert assistance given the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
