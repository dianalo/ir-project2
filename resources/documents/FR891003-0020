We also approveDelaware's adoption by reference of the above test methods and test methodrevisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This NSPS and NESHAP delegation is based upon the following conditions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Quarterly reports which may be combined with other reporting informationare to be submitted to EPA Region III, Air Enforcement Section (3AM20)by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control(DNREC) and should include the following: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Source determined to be applicable during that quarter. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Applicable sources which started operating during that quarteror which have not been previously reported: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The compliance status of the above, including the summary sheetfrom the compliance test(s); and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Any legal actions which pertain to these sources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Enforcement of the NSPS and NESHAP regulations in the State ofDelaware will be the primary responsibility of the DNREC. Where DNREC determinesthat such enforcement is not feasible and so notifies EPA, or where DNRECacts in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this delegation, EPA willexercise its concurrent enforcement authority pursuant to section 113 ofthe Clean Air Act, as amended, with respect to sources within the Stateof Delaware subject to NSPS regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Acceptance of this delegation of regulations for the source categorieslisted above does not commit the State of Delaware to request or acceptdelegation of other present or future standards and requirements. A newrequest for delegation will be required for any additional standards oramendments to previously delegated standards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. DNREC will not grant a variance from compliance with the applicableNSPS and NESHAP regulations if such variances delays compliance with theFederal Standards. Should DNREC grant such a variance EPA will considerthe source receiving the variance to be in violation of the applicableFederal regulation and may initiate enforcement action against the sourcepursuant to section 113 of the Clean Air Act. The grant of such varianceby the Agency shall also constitute grounds for revocation of delegationby EPA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. DNREC and EPA will develop a system of communication sufficientto guarantee that each office is always fully informed regarding the interpretationof applicable regulations. In instances where there is a conflict betweenDNREC's interpretation and a Federal interpretation of applicable regulations,the Federal interpretation must be applied if it is more stringent thanthat of DNREC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. If at any time there is a conflict between DNREC and the Federalregulation found at 40 CFR part 60, the federal regulation must be appliedif it is more stringent than that of DNREC. If DNREC does not have to enforcethe more stringent Federal regulation, this portion of the delegation maybe revoked. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. DNREC will utilize the methods specified in 40 CFR part 60 in performingsource tests pursuant to these regulations. However, alternatives to continuousmonitoring procedures and requirements may be acceptable upon concurrenceby EPA as stipulated in 40 CFR 60.13. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. If the Director of the Air Management Division determines thatDNREC's program for enforcing or implementing the NSPS and NESHAP regulationsis inadequate, or is not being effectively carried out this delegationmay be revoked in whole or in part. Any such revocation shall be effectiveas of the date specified in a Notice or Revocation to DNREC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA procedures permit delegation of all the Administrator's authoritiesunder 40 CFR parts 60 and 61 except for any which require rulemaking inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>to implement or where Federal overview is theonly way to ensure national consistency in the application of standards.Accordingly, the following authorities are not delegable under section111 of the Clean Air Act, as amended. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Performance Tests, andSection;andSection; 60.8(b)(2) and 60.8(b)(3).In order to ensure uniformity and technical quality in the test methodsused for enforcement of national standards, EPA will retain the authorityto approve alternative and equivalent methods which effectively replacea reference method. This restriction on delegation does not apply to 60.8(b)(1),which allows for approval of minor modifications to reference methods ona case-by-case basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some subparts include general references to the authority in andSection;60.8(b) to approve alternative or equivalent standards.

Subpart GG, andSection;andSection;60.332(a)(3) and 60.335(a)(ii). Thesesections pertain to approval of customized factors (fuel nitrogen contentand ambient air conditions, respectively), for use by gas turbine manufacturersin assembly-line compliance testing. Since each approval potentially couldaffect emissions from equipment installed in a number of States, the decisionmakingmust be maintained at the Federal level to ensure national consistency.Notice of approval must be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Equivalency Determinations, section 111(h)(3) of the Clean AirAct. Approval of alternative to any design, equipment, work practice, oroperational standard, e.g., andSection;andSection;60.114(a) and 60.302(d)(3)is accomplished through the rulemaking process and is adopted as a changeto the individual subpart.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7.
