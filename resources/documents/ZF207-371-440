(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Optical Storage Backs Up Test SystemandM;After years of high hopes and false starts, the first erasable opticalstorage devices have begun to appear on the DEC market.andP;  Although only ahandful of vendors now sell the drives, a growing number of pioneer companiesare already putting the technology to use.andM;Northern Telecom's Integrated Network Systems Group, for example, recentlyturned to erasable optical storage technology as the backbone of its backupand recovery system, needed to keep test equipment running in case ofcatastrophic failure.andM;Located in Research Triangel Park, N.C., the division manufactures digitalpublic telephone switching systems for rural and suburban use.andP;  The groupuses the Inspire erasable storage system manufactured by Alphatronix, also ofResearch Triangle Park, N.C.andM;The Inspire system is based on magneto-optic technology, in which a laserbeam reads, writes and erases magnetic information.andP;  Alphatronix officialssay this approach combines the erasability of conventional magnetic storagedevices with the advantages of optical drives: high capacity, removability,long media life and elimination of head crashes.andM;The Northern Telecom division runs a VAXcluster with four systems tiedtogether--a VAX-11/780, a VAX 8530, a VAX 8250 and a VAX 6230.andP;  The company'stest engineers run tests on digital boards using customized software programsbased on programming software from Teradyne of Boston.andM;Software programs are downloaded from the VAX 6230 to four MicroVAX IIs andare connected to four Teradyne L200 test machines via DECnet.andP;  TheL200s--which run up to 10MHz--do high-performance testing of the digitalboards to make sure they run as a unit.andP;  Alphatronix's optical disks are usedas the backup media for that Teradyne test equipment, said Mike Norfleet,Northern Telecom's senior test engineer.andP;  The test equipment and MicroVAX IIsshare the same CPU, he noted.andM;Northern Telecom currently has four 650MB Inspire cartridges with 325MB ofstorage on each side.andP;  The Inspire units installed in the Northern TelecomVAX system have a Q-bus interface.andP;  Three single-drive optical disks areinstalled in the Northern Telecom testing department, and one dual-drive unitis installed in the company's engineering department.andP;  The Inspire cartridgesare compatible with DEC's MSCP protocol, Norfleet said.andM;Benefits Already ApparentandM;According to divisional management, the technology has already paid off: InApril, the company's staff used the Alphatronix equipment when they had toreboot BoardWatch, a factory management system from Teradyne that NorthernTelecom uses to diagnose board failures and store test programs.andM;To keep operations flowing smoothly and to avoid unnecessary downtime duringthe system rebooting process, &quot;we had to break out the Alphatronix [erasableoptical mass storage system] cartridges to keep the system running,&quot; Norfleetsaid.andM;When the cartridges are needed for backup purposes, engineers remove themfrom a tape cabinet and distribute them to the Teradyne L200 test systemslocated on the production floor, Norfleet said.andM;About nine months ago, Northern Telecom officials began looking atAlphatronix's products for PC applications, but the products did not fit theneeds of the Northern Telecom division, he said.andM;Then &quot;about three months ago, we were looking at replacing [DEC's RC25K-DC]cartridge drives in the test equipment that is MicroVAX-based,&quot; Norfleetsaid.andP;  The DEC cartridges are &quot;small in storage and they're fragile,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;If you drop them, they're damaged for good.&quot;andM;Furthermore, DEC discontinued the RC25K-DC drives, so &quot;we had to come up witha different backup in case we had catastrophic failure.&quot;andP;  Norfleet said.andP;  Thecompany needed the backup &quot;if anything happened to DECnet or if an electricalstorm shut down the computer systems,&quot; he said.andM;Northern Telecom reconsidered Alphatronix's offerings--more specifically itsInspire erasable optical mass storage products--to replace the RC25K-DCs,Norfleet said, noting that his group was very impressed with Alphatronix'stechnical staff.andP;  Before making the purchase, the Northern Telecom group wentto the Alphatronix office, saw a product demonstration and talked with thecompany's technical people, who gave the group literature on optical diskdrives, he said.andM;Probably the main reason Northern Telecom chose Alphatronix as its opticalmass storage system vendor was the company's physical proximity to NorthernTelecom, Norfleet said.andM;Alphatronix's office is located just &quot;a mile and a half down the road fromus,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We felt we would get good support from them.andP;  If we had anytrouble at all we could call them up, and they could hop in the car and comeright over.&quot;andM;The only other product the group looked at was DEChs RV20 write-once,read-many (WORM) disk drive, Norfleet said.andM;Although the storage capacity of the DEC drive is much greater--2GB--thanthat of the Inspire drive--650MB--each WORM drive is priced at about $37,500.andO;&quot;That was really too expensive, and we needed four of them,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Wedidn't need to pay that price.&quot;andM;For the entire Alphatronix package, Northern Telecom paid $51,500--includinginstallation.andP;  The one dual-drive unit for the engineering department was$17,000, and each of the three single-drive units for the testing departmentwas $11,500.andM;Northern Telecom bought the drive units at the same time it purchased afourth piece of Teradyne test equipment--which cost upwards of $1 million,according to Norfleet.andP;  &quot;We budgeted a little extra money to [buy the Inspiredrives],&quot; he said.andM;To justify purchasing the Inspire drives, norfleet said he compiled a capitalfunding authorization report, explaining to upper management the gains andcost efficiencies the division would reap from replacing the RC25K-DCs.andM;Norfleet had few problems justifying the purchase of the drives tomanagement.andP;  However, justifying buying the new test equipment was tough, hesaid.andP;  &quot;We were justifying a million-dollar tester, and a $50,000 drivepackage was not a big issue,&quot; he said.andM;It took five months from the time Northern Telecom started to write thepurchase justification until the purchase order was executed, Norfleet said.andM;The Northern Telecom division received the Alphatronix system March 31, andit was installed during the second week of April.andP;  Norfleet said he wasparticularly impressed with Alphatronix's flexibility in schedulinginstallation--especially because most of the installation had to be doneafter business hours.andM;The only problem officials faced in installing the cartridges in theMicroVAXes was in getting the addresses and switches to connect properly,Norfleet said.andP;  It took an Alphatronix official and a Northern Telecom systemmanager two days to get the cartridges running in the engineering department,he said.andP;  Northern Telecom's system engineers are also beta-testingAlphantronix's Rapidstore software for file backups in the engineeringdepartment, Norfleet said.andP;  &quot;We had hoped [Rapidstore] would give us thecapability to move backups off the TK50, and it would go faster,&quot; he said.andM;Engineers do not want to use DEC's TK50 tapes because they are &quot;too slow&quot; forbackup purposes, he said.andP;  The data transfer rate for a TK50 installed in aQ-bus system is 62.5KB per second.andM;Rapidstore backs up files five times faster than tape and has a large storagecapacity, allowing backsups from several days to be stored on one 650MBoptical disk, according to Alphatronix officials.andM;In fact, backups are going faster, Norfleet said.andP;  &quot;We can back up the RD54disks in 20 minutes.andP;  That used to take an hour,&quot; he said.andM;No Multivolume BackupandM;Systems people have discovered that Rapidstore can't handle multivolumebackup--especially with RA81s, DEC's large disk drives, Norfleet said.andP;  Thesoftware can't handle two disk drives at once, he said.andP;  &quot;I've got to tell itto do the first one,&quot; he said, &quot;and when it's done, I've got to tell it to dothe second one.&quot;andM;What Norfleet would like to see the software do is prompt the operator to fita file on another drive if that drive is full, he said.andP;  &quot;[Rapidstore] can'tfit this file on this cartridge to continue.andP;  It's not smart enough to dothat,&quot; he said.andM;The Northern Telecom division has had the software just a few weeks, andAlphatronix has promised to correct the software problem by the end of theyear, Norfleet said.andP;  &quot;We may not use it unless they take care of the problembefore then,&quot; he said.andM;Because Alphatronix is using Northern Telecom as a beta site for Rapidstore,the software is free.andP;  Alphatronix officials quoted a price of $995 forRapidstore, Norfleet said.andM;Right now, test engineers have to &quot;physically flip&quot; the Inspire cartridges touse the other sides, Norfleet said, a process that he hopes will be improvedby Alphatronix.andP;  It would help if the cartridges would turn overautomatically, Norfleet said, but he added, &quot;The technology is not thereyet.&quot;andM;Overall, Northern Telecom is pleased with the Inspire mass storage system,Norfleet said.andP;  The only other improvement he would like to see is anincrease in the product's speed, he said.andM;A Winchester RD54 drive has a 38.3-millisecond (ms) access time, he noted,whereas an Inspire drive has a 90ms access time.andP;  Norfleet believes, however,that Alphatronix is working on improving Inspire's speed, he said.andM;But &quot;you can hardly rip apart a Winchester drive and carry it around in yourbriefcase,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The Alphatronix [Inspire drive] is cartridge-sized andportable.andP;  That's what we need.andP;  If anything goes down, the VAX systemsengineer grabs [the Inspire drives] and goes out and distributes them to theproduction floor.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
