Subroto, speaking at an oil conference here, also said successdepended on unequivocal support for the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries from non-OPEC oil producers.   OPEC's price monitoring committee and its long-term strategycommittee are to meet in Madrid Oct. 20. The cartel is to hold afull meeting in Vienna in late November.   ``It is not an easy task and maybe one or more meetings (afterthe Madrid meeting) are necessary to reach a final production andpricing strategy,'' Subroto said.   ``Clearly, the present level of oil prices is unacceptable,''Subroto said. ``OPEC is determined to restore oil prices as soon aspossible to the $18-a-barrel level.''   Oil prices now range $6 to $8 below that OPEC target price.   Current OPEC production of about 20 million barrels a day is``an unnatural level,'' the chairman said, adding, ``We are goingto bring it back to the level we agreed to.''   All OPEC nations except Iraq agreed in June to continue to limittheir production to 15.06 million barrels a day until the end ofthe year, but several cartel members are exceeding their individualoutput quotas.   ``We are confident that we will be able to resolve theseproblems and to formulate a long-term stategy on oil prices andproduction,'' Subroto said.   Subroto said his optimism was based on recent consultations withvarious OPEC nations and on the end of hostilities in the PersianGulf.   ``There is almost a consensus that unless something is done,prices would continue to slide down. We are more aware now than atany other time of the gravity and dangers of the currentsituation.''   However, he added, that the prospect of achieving oil pricestability ``remains somewhat bleak'' as long as non-OPEC producersare indifferent toward OPEC.   ``What the oil industry urgently needs is a broader baseddialogue between OPEC and all other OPEC oil producers,'' he said.   Overproduction by OPEC is not the only factor pressuring prices,Subroto said, saying non-OPEC producers, which include the SovietUnion, United States and Britain, are producing as much as they can.   He accused the non-OPEC producers of enjoying the benefits ofthe cartel's efforts without having to ``endure any of thesacrifices.''   The oil conference at which Subroto spoke was sponsored by theInternational Herald Tribune and the Oil Daily.</TEXT></DOC>
