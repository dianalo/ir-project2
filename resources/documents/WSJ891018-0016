The B/T gene rearrangement test is more accurate than existing tests for diagnosing the type of cancer, whether it has spread or whether there is a recurrence following treatment, said Oncor President Stephen Turner. Mr. Turner said the test initially will be used in conjunction with biopsies and other tests, but eventually might become the benchmark for tumor analysis. Mr. Turner said the test will be shipped in 45 days to hospitals and clinical laboratories.    Dr. Wyndham Wilson, a cancer treatment specialist at the National Cancer Institute, said the test is widely used in research centers but isn't having a major impact because it is only occasionally useful in choosing the most effective treatment. But the test may prove to be more sensitive in determining whether a tumor has spread or returned following treatment, Dr. Wilson said. &quot;We don't know yet how useful it's going to be,&quot; he said.    Oncor, a six-year-old developer of genetic medical tests, projects that the cancer test will help it to post its first-ever profit during the first quarter of 1990, Mr. Turner said. The company will charge $35 for a test and projects about $2 million in revenue from the test during the first 12 months of marketing, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
