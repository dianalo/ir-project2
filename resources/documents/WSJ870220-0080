Mr. Guess, 45 years old, of Pear Blossom, Calif., was arrested last March for allegedly agreeing to transport large amounts of cash out of the U.S. for an undercover Customs Service agent.    After a two-week trial Mr. Guess was convicted Jan. 13 of conspiracy to defraud the U.S., trying to violate currency-reporting laws and illegal operation of a bank under the Glass-Steagall Act.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said the case is apparently one of the first criminal prosecutions under the Glass-Steagall statute, which prohibits unlicensed banks from receiving deposits in the U.S.    Mr. Guess was sentenced in federal court here yesterday by U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton. A co-defendant in the case, David Harkrider of Englewood, Colo., Primera's owner, previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation, the government said.    Michael Young, Mr. Guess's lawyer, said he is appealing both the conviction and the sentence. </TEXT></DOC>
