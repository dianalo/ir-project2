It's not only the terms of the contract that shippers andlabor economists are tracking, but also Teamster tactics atthe union's largest employer. &quot;This will set a precedent fora lot of labor contracts,&quot; this year and next, said PaulSchlesinger, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp.</LP><TEXT>   So far, ambivalent national Teamsters leaders havenegotiated a contract to replace the one expiring at midnighttonight EDT -- but now are advising their 140,000 members atUPS to reject it in balloting extended until Aug. 10.   Trucking executives, UPS competitors and analysts believethe vote is too close to call, but they expect both sides tocontinue to negotiate if Teamsters reject the UPS contract. Astrike is considered unlikely. &quot;A strike would hurt UPS andthe Teamsters, because UPS could permanently lose substantialmarket share in both the air and ground package services tononunion competitors,&quot; said George Robertson, an analyst atAlex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore.   UPS, the nation's largest deliverer of packages, alreadypays its full-time truck drivers about $16.10 an hour, makingthem the highest-paid unionized workers in the truckingbusiness. The company proposed a wage increase of 50 cents anhour, or about 3%, each year of the three-year contract. UPSalso offered a one-time signing bonus of $1,000 for full-timeworkers and $500 for part-timers and a cost-of-livingincrease for all unionized workers, capped at 20 cents anhour, in the second and third years of the contract.   The contract includes a boost in the company's annualhealth, welfare and pension contributions to $10,500, from$8,300 currently, for each full-time employee by the thirdyear of the contract.   Having negotiated all this, Teamster leaders then decidedthey don't like the size of the wage increase, a UPS plan touse additional part-time workers and the company's strictadherence to demanding production quotas. What's more, apower struggle within the Teamsters has complicatednegotiations. Meanwhile, UPS is trying harder than ever tohold down costs and gain labor flexibility as it battleseffective, nonunion competitors on the ground and in the air.   &quot;These may be the toughest circumstances surrounding a UPScontract in the past decade,&quot; said Mr. Schlesinger.   The outcome will reverberate through the ranks ofConsolidated Freightways Inc., Roadway Services Inc. andother less-than-truckload carriers faced with expiration oftheir Teamsters contract March 30, 1991. What happens to UPS&quot;will provide some indication of what we can expect laterthis year,&quot; when freight carriers begin to negotiate a newthree-year contract, said James R. Allen, a vice president ofPalo Alto, Calif.-based Consolidated Freightways.   Less-than-truckload carriers, which carry the freight ofseveral shippers in one trailer, could gain business if theTeamsters strike UPS. &quot;Some of their freight would flow tous,&quot; said Kenneth Mayhew, president and chief executiveofficer of Carolina Freight Corp., Cherryville, N.C.   But such carriers, facing overcapacity, stiff competitionand marginal profits, can't be as generous when they bargainwith their 200,000 Teamster workers. UPS is a &quot;rich employer,whereas we're part of a poor industry,&quot; said Mr. Allen.   Last year UPS reported net income of $693.4 million onrevenue of $12.4 billion. But the company's profit margindeclined to 5.6% from 8.1% in 1987, reflecting the costs ofboth meeting increased competition for packages in the U.S.and expanding into air delivery at home and abroad.   Kent C. Nelson, UPS chairman and chief executive officer,said the company wants to use additional part-time workers,earning about 60% of full-time hourly wage rates, to bettercompete with nonunion Federal Express Corp. He added thatwith more part-timers the company could afford to deliverovernight air packages earlier in the day and on Saturdays.   Also influencing the vote on the contract are workerattitudes about the rigid production standards to which UPSholds its drivers and package sorters. UPS &quot;zeroes in on theleast-best employees and harangues them until they meet thestandards,&quot; said Walter Mitchell, president of packagedeliverer ZoneSkip Inc. and a former UPS national marketingmanager who is writing a book about his ex-employer. UPS hasbecome very successful managing labor &quot;with the whip and achair,&quot; said Mr. Mitchell.   UPS is trying to court union labor with changes in style,including rewards for workers who exceed the standards andmore comfortable, contemporary uniforms. Next month thecompany will test Bermuda shorts for some West Coast drivers.   Mr. Nelson said the company is trying to &quot;manage all ofthe people in a more positive way&quot; while preserving itsvaunted efficiency based on close scrutiny of its workers.&quot;We pay them more and they produce more,&quot; said Mr. Nelson,adding that any relaxation of UPS's emphasis on productionwould be the &quot;death knell for this company.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
