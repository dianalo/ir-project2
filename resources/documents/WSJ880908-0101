This is an awesome tribute to the people who put out that sterling publication, since we are not in the market for a new car, stereo or VCR, and don't plan to replace our radon detector. But we do occasionally buy spackling compounds, we are always price-comparing hand-held fuzzball fighters, and we have never entirely ruled out the possibility of purchasing a cross-country ski exerciser.    One thing I have always admired about Consumer Reports is its thoroughness. Who else runs stories like &quot;Exterior caulking: ease of gunning&quot;? Who else tabulates the results of 50,000 diaper changes? Who else does such exhaustive comparisons of over-the-counter head-lice salves?    Given my respect for the publication, I was stunned to learn that Consumers Union has been sundered by a bitter labor-management confrontation. The union accuses management of refusing to negotiate a new contract, provoking a 1984 strike, retaining a union-busting law firm, threatening to fire activist employees, and instituting a two-tier, merit-pay based salary system unfair to union employees.    Management has denied most of these charges, and is outraged that the AFL-CIO has actually placed Consumer Reports on its boycott list. Management is similarly incensed that CU employees walk around the organization's Mount Vernon, N.Y., headquarters wearing badges telling visitors not to buy the magazine.    The issues are complex and worrisome, but what concerns me as a consumer is this: As a result of the conflict, CU employees have been withholding &quot;sensory input&quot; from management since 1987 and refusing to volunteer for taste tests of food and beverages. Although in all other respects they continue conscientiously to do their jobs, the sensory input they previously supplied free of charge has been kept inside their mouths in the past 18 months. Instead, those taste panels in Consumer Reports are the work of outside tasters. Paid tasters. Tasters at places like Kansas State University. Scab tasters.    The implications are most troubling. I, like many others, had long assumed that when Consumer Reports declared, as it did last October, that Norbest Tender Timed Young Frozen Turkey had &quot;dark meat low in flavor, with slight, oily mouthfeel,&quot; that these were the findings of CU taste panels. Same deal when Consumer Reports complained that Aunt Jemima's Extra Thick Pancake Syrup had a &quot;slightly artificial maple flavor.&quot; I assumed this because right on top of the chart it said that the results of the Sensory Index were &quot;based on scores from CU's trained taste panel.&quot; What I didn't know was that none of those trained tasters were CU employees. They were professional, outside tasters.    It wasn't easy to get this information. When I talked to union officials, they wanted to dwell on management's 8% wage hike, and the seeming incongruity in having an organization founded by striking workers 52 years ago headed by a director earning $147,000 a year. Good points. But what I really wanted to know was: Who were the folks reporting that Hills Brothers Gold Ground Coffee suffered from mild acidity? Whose judgment was it that Kroger's Peanut Butter tasted rancid?    Management wasn't much more interested in my inquiries than the union. Managers wanted to talk about disruptive union tactics such as publishing managers' salaries on a bulletin board, and sending strike literature to prominent donors found on a confidential mailing list. I wanted to talk about Aunt Jemima. Eventually, Assistant Director David Berliner explained that it had never been &quot;cost-effective&quot; for CU to have full-time tasters on the staff, so a lot of the work was farmed out to sensory panels at various institutions around the country. He said CU incurred negligible additional expense as a result, but union officials said those voluntary sensory panels saved the organization plenty.    Further details were hard to come by. Gordon Hard, vice chairman of CU's union, wanted to talk about the suit management brought against him for allegedly posting the salary chart on the bulletin board. Assistant Director Berliner wanted to talk about CU's generous new offer to the guild. I wanted to talk about the putative acidity in Chase andamp; Sanborn's Decaffeinated coffee.    For me, the issue came to a head when I called Elizabeth Smith, manager of the Sensory Center at Kansas State, and tried getting details about how much strike-related tasting the school was doing. She slammed the phone down on me. That made me decide I was going to shelve Consumer Reports for a while and read apolitical Road andamp; Track instead. Consumers Union may be or may not be using scab tasters, but my feet have never crossed a picket line, and neither has my tongue. So until this little fracas is resolved, I'll make up my own mind about Vermont mail-order cheddar cheese. I take bread off no man's table. I take peanut butter out of no man's mouth.    ---   Mr. Queenan is a writer for Barron's magazine. </TEXT></DOC>
