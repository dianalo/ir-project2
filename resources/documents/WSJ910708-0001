Administration aides remain incensed at Iraqi leaderSaddam Hussein over his regime's refusal to give a U.N.inspection team access last week to equipment the U.S.believes is used for the enrichment of uranium for use innuclear bombs. The Iraqi leader on Friday sent the U.N.Secretary-General a letter promising full access to theequipment this week, and a new U.N. inspection team arrivedover the weekend in Baghdad to test that offer.</LP><TEXT>   But U.S. officials are openly cynical about the promise ofimproved behavior by Saddam Hussein. &quot;He says he'll be a goodboy now,&quot; one senior official said. &quot;And if you believe thatI've got some real estate in the desert to offer you.&quot;   As a result, the administration continues to activelyconsider launching a bombing raid to strike at the nuclearequipment the U.S. has been tracking by reconnaissancephotos. A decision could be made soon, officials suggest, andaction wouldn't be put off just because Mr. Bush plans tobegin a period of travel and visits with foreign leaderslater this week.   The president and his top national security advisershaven't yet met to make a final determination, officialssaid. Nor, they said, has the administration made a finaldecision on the sensitive question of whether to seek anotherU.N. resolution specifically authorizing action in the eventof a new raid.   Officials say there is a &quot;general consensus&quot; within theadministration that adequate authority for a new militarystrike is contained in existing U.N. cease-fire resolutionsthat lay out the steps Iraq must take to eliminate itsunconventional-weapons programs before economic sanctionsagainst it will be lifted. The resolutions include generallanguage saying the Security Council can take steps to ensurethat Iraq obeys the resolutions.   Still, the administration is weighing the possibility ofseeking a U.N. resolution specifically approving militaryaction against Iraq's nuclear-weapons program, which the U.S.military once thought was largely eliminated by bombingduring the Gulf War. If it could be obtained, a newresolution would eliminate doubts about whether the U.S. islegally entitled to act and solidify international supportfor a move.   On the other hand, seeking a resolution would be a riskycourse that could end up undermining any U.S. hopes of actingmilitarily. Though Britain is prepared to fully support amilitary strike, some other members of the Security Councilseem to have reservations. If a resolution is sought butvoted down in the Security Council, the U.S. would find itpolitically difficult to move.   Tensions over Iraq's nuclear program rose sharply in thepast two weeks when Iraq blocked a U.N. team from inspectingnuclear equipment three times. In one incident, Iraqisoldiers fired warning shots to stop U.N. inspectors who weretrying to see and photograph equipment that they believe isused for enriching uranium to weapons-grade material. Theequipment was being spirited away from an Iraqi militaryinstallation by trucks at the time.   In an apparent effort to head off military action or otherdrastic reprisals from the U.S. and the U.N., Saddam Husseinon Friday sent the U.N. Secretary-General a letter promisingthat a new U.N. mission would receive by today an accountingof, and access to, &quot;the items about which it soughtinformation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
