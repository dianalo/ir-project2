Instability of dieselfuels is usually defined by the formation of insoluble sediments andgums. Gravimetric stability tests have been conducted at 43{sup 0} and80{sup 0}C, respectively, using three model nitrogen heterocycles, 2-methylpyridine,2,6-di methyl quinoline, and dodecahydrocarbazole, as dopants in an otherwisestable shale diesel fuel. Potential interactive effects have been definedfor these three model nitrogen heterocycles in the stable fuel in thepresence of a second model dopant, t-butyl hydroperoxide. 2-Methyl pyridineand 2,6-dimethyl quinoline were inactive and only 2-methyl pyridine showedslight positive interactive effects. Dodecahydrocarbazole formed largeamounts of insolubles by itself and exhibited positive interactive effects.</TEXT></DOC>
