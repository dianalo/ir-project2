There was no evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending inreports Thursday from the nation's largest retailers, which showedmany of them enjoyed healthy sales gains in February.   A continuing turnaround in women's apparel and renewed demand forother consumer and household goods contributed to last month's gainsfor department stores, discount chains and general merchandisevendors.   Retail sales measure important aspects of consumer spendingactivity, which accounts for about two-thirds of all U.S. economicactivity.   Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at the investment banking firmBear, Stearns andamp; Co., said the recent rise in interest rates, partlyreflecting the Federal Reserve Board's effort to squeezeinflationary pressures, may be changing people's minds aboutspending.   ``I think we are already in the early stages of a slowdown inconsumer spending,'' Kudlow said. ``You are seeing a higher savingsrate, which is the flip side of slower spending.''   Higher interest rates will have the most impact on purchasestypically financed over time, such as cars and home appliances.Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.,said the effect on sales of clothing and routine items will be muchmore limited.   ``We still remain relatively sanguine about the retailingoutlook, given the improvement in women's apparel as well as ourbelief that retailers will maintain very strong control overinventories and expenses,'' he said.   For many of the retailers, February marked the start of their1989 financial year. Balance sheets showed signs of improvement lastyear, analysts said, due largely to unexpectedly brisk businessbefore and after Christmas.   February typically is a low-volume month as merchants prepare fora seasonal shopping pickup in the spring. But analysts detectedfavorable omens in the latest tallies.   One good sign was stronger sales of apparel, apparently becausewomen are finding the latest styles more appealing than last year'sfashions.   Limited Inc., the apparel retailer, said sales rose 22 percent inthe four weeks ended Feb. 25 from the year before and sales atstores open at least a year _ called same-store sales _ went up by19 percent.   Retailers and industry analysts say same-store sales give a moreaccurate reading of a company's performance than totals that includesales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports same-storesales.   At Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, salesof sporting goods, toys and auto accessories posted strong gains,said Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of SearsMerchandise Group.   Sears, which on Wednesday inaugurated a new low-pricing policy atall of its more than 800 stores, said sales for the four weeks endedFeb. 25 went up 13.2 percent from the year-earlier level andsame-store sales rose 6.6 percent.   K mart Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph E. Antonini said salesof small appliances, home electronics and items in its pharmacydivision contributed to overall sales growth.   K mart's sales for the four weeks ended Feb. 22 grew 8.3 percentand sales at stores open a year or more were up by 3.5 percent.   William R. Howell, chairman of J.C. Penney Co. Inc., saidpromotions for Valentine's Day and President's Day boosted sales,particularly for men's merchandise and home furnishings.   Penney said sales in the four weeks ended Feb. 25 increased 5.3percent and same-store sales gained 2.5 percent. The company hasdiscontinued lines such as home electronics, some sporting goods andphotographic equipment over the year and, excluding those lines,sales for February rose 9.8 percent.   Among other retailers reporting Thursday:   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fast-growing discount and generalmerchandise chain based in Bentonville, Ark., recorded a 25 percentsales rise in February. Same-store sales rose 11 percent.   Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. said sales for the fourweeks ended Feb. 25 were up 11 percent over the year and same-storesales rose 4.7 percent.   The results reported Thursday were from most of the biggestgeneral merchandise chains and apparel retailers, excluding CampeauCorp., R.H. Macy andamp; Co. and Batus Inc., which do not release monthlyfigures. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federalgovernment, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarketsor restaurants.</TEXT></DOC>
