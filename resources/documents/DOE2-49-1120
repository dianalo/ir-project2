Climatic change alters species' biogeography by creatingand eliminating barriers that affect gene flow between populations. Forbenthic organisms such as shallow marine ostracodes, thermal gradientsat biogeographic province boundaries and the area of continental shelfare factors affected by climatic and associated sea level changes. Studiesof Cenozoic marine ostracodes show that allopatric speciation does notaccount for paleobiogeographic patterns of species subjected to climaticchange. Studies of 127 endemic species from middle latitudes of the westernAtlantic show that most speciation events in temperature and subtropicaltaxa are, in the zoogeographic sense, sympatric or parapatric-clinaland are induced by oceanographic changes related to climatic events ratherthan geographic isolation of populations. Most ostracode species in middlelatitudes are adapted to frequent, cyclical climatic changes typicalof these regions and originated during rare periods of major climatictransition. High-latitude arctic-subarctic genera such as Finmarchinellahave circumpolar distributions. A parapatric-clinal model accounts forspeciation patterns observed in some high-latitude and tropical taxa.However the dynamic nature of thermal gradients and species' biogeographyduring climatic change renders questionable the controversial distinctionbetween parapatric and allopatric-peripatric speciation models.</TEXT></DOC>
