But the banks intend to object to the generous fee proposal, arguing that the legal bills may be far too steep for the Hunt-held entities that are enmeshed in bankruptcy-court proceedings here. Among the concerns of the banks is that the Hunt corporations in Chapter 11 proceedings, including Placid Oil Co., the big independent oil producer, will be shouldering an unusually large portion of the billings compared with the other Hunt companies and trusts that aren't in bankruptcy-law proceedings but are also suing 23 U.S. and foreign lenders.    In bankruptcy-court proceedings, a debtor may only hire a lawyer to handle the bankruptcy case or another matter with court approval. Under Chapter 11, Placid, a Placid unit and the William Herbert Hunt trust continue to operate with protection from the banks and other creditors while they work out a plan to pay their debts.    Besides the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Hunts filed two lawsuits in federal court here seeking a total of $13.8 billion and accusing their lenders of fraud, breach of contract, banking and antitrust law violations after the lenders refused to restructure about $1.5 billion in loans to Placid and its sister company, Penrod Drilling Co. Earlier this month, the Hunts hired Stephen D. Susman, a Houston trial lawyer, to take charge of the two lawsuits, when the Hunts' first team of attorneys resigned from the case after a string of legal defeats.    Mr. Susman and his firm, Susman, Godfrey andamp; McGowan, aren't involved in the Chapter 11 case. In a court filing seeking the bankruptcy judge's approval to represent Placid and other entities in the case against the banks, the firm proposes to charge a $400 hourly rate for Mr. Susman's time plus a $200-an-hour, or a 50% premium, to the hourly rate.    Mr. Susman's $600 fee is nearly triple the hourly rate being charged by Texas lawyers representing many of the banks in the case and exceeds legal fees levied by some of the nation's top lawyers, whose hourly rates are usually in the $350-to-$400 range, legal experts say.    Also, Mr. Susman wants $1 million as an upfront initial retainer that will be held in an interest-bearing escrow account and from which the Susman firm's monthly billings will be drawn. After depleting the first $1 million, or after three months on the case, the firm plans to give a quarterly estimate for fees that the Hunts will forward to the escrow account. The firm said it didn't know what the total fees might come to.    The Susman firm's fees would be collected whether it wins or loses the case for the Hunts. If the Susman firm is terminated by the Hunts for any reason other than malpractice -- or the Hunts drop their lawsuits -- the firm can pocket the entire retainer. A malpractice or fee dispute would be arbitrated by the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, Mr. Susman's alma mater. A decision by the dean is final, the fee agreement says.    Mr. Susman is vacationing in Italy and couldn't be reached. A spokesman for the Hunts also was unavailable. William H. White, another attorney in the Susman firm, said he didn't know if the Hunts had signed the fee agreement. He also said that the firm's fees are fixed each January and that Mr. Susman's base rate of $400 an hour won't take effect unless approved by the firm's partners next month. This year, Mr. Susman's basic hourly rate is $375.    Although Mr. Susman's personal rate, combined with a 50% premium, is considered quite high by other lawyers, some provisions -- the retainer and arbitrator -- aren't unusual for such a complex case. &quot;It's a basic, standard fee agreement you would have in any case with a couple of exceptions you'd find in an exceptional case,&quot; Mr. White says.    He said the 50% premium for Mr. Susman as well as the several other lawyers involved in the case reflects the large time commitment the case is expected to demand and the inability of the relatively small Susman firm to take on some other legal work while it works on the case. </TEXT></DOC>
