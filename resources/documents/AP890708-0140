Journalists were taken on a tour Friday of former guerrilla baseseast of Jalalabad, where fierce battles between the army andinsurgents were reported Wednesday.   At one point, an Afghan officer shouted: ``Stop! There may beland mines!'' He tiptoed forward on a narrow road near a lumber mill.   Government troops were in complete control of Jalalabad and ofSamarkhiel, seven miles to the southeast, and other rebel basesnearby. Lt. Gen. Manoky Mangal said soldiers were advancing todestroy guerrilla bases near the Pakistani border.   Jalalabad, on the main route from Kabul to the Khyber Pass andPakistan, is 75 miles east of the Afghan capital and 45 miles fromthe border.   ``Once again they dreamed to occupy Jalalabad, but once again wehave destroyed them,'' Mangal said. He is military governor ofNangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is the capital.   Moslem insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup inApril 1978, attacked Jalalabad on March 7. It was their first majorassault the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from Afghanistanwas completed Feb. 15, ending nine years of involvement in the civilwar.   Journalists representing Western media were flown to Jalalabad ina Soviet-built Afghan air force helicopter.   Amanullah Nooro, the 35-year-old pilot, fired rockets and droppedflares to frustrate any attempt by guerrillas to attack the chopper.Four helicopter gunships flew escort.   Mangal said at least 2,000 insurgents had been killed and 4,000wounded in the operation around Jalalabad, and gave governmentcasualties as 26 dead.   Both sides customarily exaggerate enemy losses and minimize theirown.   The government offensive began after reports that the U.S.-backedguerrillas were preparing new attacks on Jalalabad. Capturing thecity, Afghanistan's fifth-largest, would have given them a seat forthe interim government they formed in Pakistan after the Sovietwithdrawal.   ``We had information that the enemy was regrouping and planninganoher attack on Jalalabad,'' said Mangal, a 41-year-old formerphysician who joined the army after the coup in 1978.   ``We decided to strike first,'' he said. ``Our strategy paid offand now we are heading toward the bases on the border withPakistan.''</TEXT></DOC>
