Among the most vociferous proponents of sanctions are the blackfront-line states of southern Africa, which ironically carry onconsiderable trade with South Africa and are tied to it by railroadsand power lines. These nations do not ban bilateral trade with SouthAfrica.   The report issued this week from the United Nations Center onTransnational Corporations notes that in recent years the front-linestates have become transshipment points for South African goods.   Among other South African tactics cited in the report are these:   _Mislabeling export goods such as textiles sent to America,apples to Europe and wines to Canada.   _Illegal transfer of ownership on oil shipments to skirt the banon such shipments from oil-producing states.   _Transshipment of goods through other states. South Africa'stextile industry, for example, makes extensive use of foreignfactories to complete the manufacture of fabrics and assemblegarments.   _Sending South African coal to European ports that do not ban it,primarily Rotterdam and Anterp, where it is mixed with othernations' coal to produce ``Dutch blend'' or simply relabeled asDutch and transshipped.   _Turning to the booming Far Eastern nations for increased tradeas North American and European nations have tightened theirsanctions.   Still, most governments have responded to appeals by the GeneralAssembly for a voluntary sanctions on South Africa, the report notes.   ``As a result, broad geographical and economic areas and sectorshave been left outside the reach of South Africa, or avoidancepractices in these areas have imposed additional costs on itseconomy,'' the report says.   The Center notes that ``markets for South African products havedeclined in size, indicating that efforts to evade sanctions havebeen only partially successful.''   The report did not set an exact figure on the cost of sanctionsto South Africa, but noted the country's economy has been weakthrough the 1980s with a growth rate below 1.5 percent a year.   Official unemployment rates among South African blacks is atleast 15 percent and unofficial estimates are much higher. Inaddition, the country has a foreign debt of $22 billion,three-fourths of it owed to transnational banks.   The General Assembly has been urging nations and companies toshun South Africa since 1962.   The Security Council imposed a mandatory ban on arms trade withSouth Africa in 1977. That spurred the country to develop its ownarms industry, which has turned into a profitable export business.   In 1985, the Security Council endorsed a voluntary embargo on newinvestments, export loan guarantees, the sale of Krugerrand goldcoins, nuclear contracts and computer equipment.   However, Britain and the United States have always vetoedresolutions that call for mandatory sanctions, saying that wouldhurt the black population.
