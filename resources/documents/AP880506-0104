Chirac said the return of Capt. Dominique Prieur respects aU.N.-mediated accord with New Zealand under which she was held.   But New Zealand criticized Mrs. Prieur's release as ``a breachof France's obligation under international law.''   Mrs. Prieur, 38, and Alain Mafart, 37, were arrested after theJuly 1985 Aukland Harbor bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship ofthe environmental group Greenpeace. It was preparing to lead aprotest flotilla to Mururoa, a South Pacific island where Franceconducts underground nuclear tests.   A Dutch crewman on the Rainbow Warrior was killed in the bombing.   ``Mrs. Prieur is now pregnant, and the accord foresaw that, inthis circumstance, she should be returned to Paris,'' the premiersaid during a stop in the town of Agen where he was campaigning forSunday's runoff against President Francois Mitterrand.   The New Zealand opposition National Party leader, Jim Bolger, astrong critic of the U.N. accord, said the repatriations of Mrs.Prieur and Mafart showed the original deal was worthless.   Mafart was brought back to France in December after complainingof a stomach disorder. New Zealand officials have tried and failedto force the return of Mafart, who completed entrance examinationsfor a French war college since returning to the mainland.   Bolger said Chirac clearly believed he would benefit by bringingboth agents home before the election.   A Defense Ministry spokesman had said previously that the returnone year early from exile ``concerned the person of Mrs. Prieur.''Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said she had left the atollof Hao but did not say when she would arrive in mainland France.   He said the government was surprised at the protests from NewZealand Prime Minister David Lange.   In a statement issued by its Amsterdam office, London-basedGreenpeace said it was ``surprised and angered'' about Mrs.Prieur's return to France.   The Greenpeace statement said the Dutch government ``was eitherinformed about the intention to release Prieur, or it was lied toin that respect.''   Last month, a Dutch Foreign Ministry official traveled to theHoa atoll to investigate the terms of Mrs. Prieur's detention.   The two agents were sentenced to 10 years in prison afterpleading guilty to manslaughter. But under the agreement negotiatedby U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, New Zealandturned the agents over to France on the condition that they stay ata military base on Hao, near Mururoa, until July 1989.   The accord had stipulated that the two could not leave theisland without the consent of New Zealand.   As part of the agreement, Paris apologized for the bombing, paid$7 million compensation and promised not to block New Zealandexports to Europe.   Mrs. Prieur is married to Joel Prieur, who was a Parisfirefighter at the time of her arrest and now works for the DefenseMinistry. He has visited her frequently since her transfer to Hao.</TEXT></DOC>
