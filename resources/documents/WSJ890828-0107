And it still suffers from dilapidated track, costly union contracts and few customers.    But that apparently isn't going to stop at least three different railroads from bidding for the Dandamp;H when the bankruptcy trustee puts the rail line on the auction block. Officials of Delaware Otsego Corp., Guilford Transportation Industries Inc. and the rail unit of Montreal-based CP Ltd. say they may place bids to buy the Delaware andamp; Hudson.    In addition, Francis Dicello, trustee for the bankrupt carrier, said he's received inquiries from several other concerns that might bid for assets of the Delaware andamp; Hudson. The bidding deadline is Friday, but Mr. Dicello is seeking to extend that deadline until Sept. 25.    Two of the potential bidders are well-versed in the Delaware andamp; Hudson's problems and possibilities. Delaware Otsego, Cooperstown, N.Y., has been operating the Delaware andamp; Hudson on an interim basis since the bankruptcy filing. And closely held Guilford, North Billerica, Mass., operated the line prior to its filing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and remains one of the line's largest creditors. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.    Potential bidders believe the Delaware andamp; Hudson &quot;could be a profitable addition to their railroads or are afraid its addition to someone else's railroad might hurt them,&quot; said Patrick Little, a partner in Aandamp;L Associates, a railroad consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. By some guesses, cash bids for the Delaware andamp; Hudson are likely to range from $15 million to $45 million. The outcome is important to shippers who say the Delaware andamp; Hudson provides at least limited rail competition to Philadelphia-based Consolidated Rail Corp. in the Northeast. &quot;Competition from the Delaware andamp; Hudson tempers Conrail's rates and in some cases, motor-carrier rates,&quot; said Richard Aumiller, transportation manager of a unit of Agway Inc., a Syracuse, N.Y., agricultural cooperative. Mr. Aumiller estimates that absent competition from the Delaware andamp; Hudson, rail rates in the Northeast for many commodities would rise 20% to 25%.    The Delaware andamp; Hudson's tracks extend to Albany and Binghamton, N.Y., and Sunbury, Pa., from Montreal. The line also has trackage rights on Conrail that allow its trains to reach Buffalo, N.Y., and Washington.    Some potential buyers have dropped out. Rail industry executives said Conrail feared opposition from shippers, government officials and other railroads worried about a loss of rail competition in the Northeast. Conrail officials said the railroad decided not to bid but declined to comment further. Canadian National Railway Co., Montreal, also looked at the Delaware andamp; Hudson before deciding it wouldn't be a bidder. A spokesman for Grand Trunk Corp., a Canadian National subsidiary, said the Canadian National already owns several rail routes into the U.S. and &quot;didn't need another connection.&quot;    But CP Rail, a unit of CP Ltd., said it is considering a bid for the Delaware andamp; Hudson, its main connection to the U.S. market. &quot;Keeping the Delaware andamp; Hudson alive is an important part of protecting our revenue base in eastern Canada,&quot; said Robert Ritchie, an executive vice president of CP Rail, which would seek to expand the Delaware andamp; Hudson's north-south rail traffic.    Potential bidder Delaware Otsego currently operates cross-country container trains to New York connecting with the Delaware andamp; Hudson and other railroads. Walter Rich, Delaware Otsego's chief executive officer, said he would substantially boost container traffic over the Delaware andamp; Hudson in competition with Conrail and truckers if he becomes the line's buyer. As interim operator of the Delaware andamp; Hudson, Mr. Rich has received financial and operational support from rail giants Norfolk Southern Corp., Norfolk, Va., and CSX Corp., Richmond, Va. Neither CSX nor Norfolk Southern, which had owned the Delaware andamp; Hudson before selling the line to Guilford in 1984, plan to place bids for the railroad.    A bid by Guilford is likely to meet resistance. The Delaware andamp; Hudson was a Guilford unit when it filed for bankruptcy law protection in June 1988. Prior to that service on the line had deteriorated, reflecting labor-management strife. Shippers along the line say service has improved under interim operator Delaware Otsego. &quot;Giving the Delaware andamp; Hudson back to the leadership that gave it the deep six would be a colossal mistake,&quot; said William Withuhn, transportation curator of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.    Guilford officials say the only reason they put the Delaware andamp; Hudson into bankruptcy-law proceedings was that an arbitrator's decision prevented Guilford from transferring the railroad to a unit with lower labor costs and fewer union restrictions. Guilford previously slashed labor costs at the Maine Central and Boston andamp; Maine, its other rail units, by leasing them to its low-cost subsidiary. Guilford said the arbitrator's decision preventing it from doing the same with the Delaware andamp; Hudson has since been reversed. </TEXT></DOC>
