In collectingand processing epidemiologic, demographic and dosimetric data on a limitedarea as FVG there is one advantage, namely the opportunity of havingeverything at hand-- the data and the persons who collected them, withthe possibility of on-line and constant checks. Hopefully, this shouldresult in a good level of accuracy of the statistical estimates, whichmay prove useful samples for more wide studies carried out by officialnational institutes.</TEXT></DOC>
