Edwards believes that most federal appealscourt judges don't mix their law with their politics, andhe's compiled a formidable data base to buttress his view.   Writing in the Wisconsin Law Review (Volume 1991, No. 5),Judge Edwards, a Carter appointee to the powerful U.S. Courtof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, raps news reporters andother commentators for spreading a false impression thatjudges' ideologies are critical to their legal decisions.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, he says, 97.4% of all decisions decided by D.C.Circuit panels in the 1989-90 term were unanimous. Ofdecisions that warranted full opinions, rather than shortermemorandum treatment, 90% were unanimous. Data from previousyears, regardless of the reported ideological balance of thecourt at the time, yielded similar results. Yet the D.C.Circuit is widely depicted, he says, as an ideologicalbattleground.   The broad base of agreement across party lines stems, hesays, from most judges' commitment to what the calls&quot;principled decision-making&quot; -- deciding cases based onprecedent, statute or constitutional norm, rather than on apreferred result.   Dividing the court's caseload into &quot;easy,&quot; &quot;hard,&quot; and&quot;very hard&quot; cases, he finds that only 5% to 15% were veryhard, meaning that &quot;careful research and reflection fail toyield conclusive answers&quot; based solely on legal principlesand precedents. Only in this category, he suggests, do judgesdraw on their own social and moral beliefs with anyregularity.   Nonetheless, he says, the news media couch almost allmajor appeals court decisions as victories for a conservativeor liberal wing, even when no ideological issue isdiscernible. Thus, he laments, &quot;the public is led to believethat judges cast their votes on judicial decisions as if inParliament, i.e., strictly along party lines.&quot; Part of thereason for this, he suggests, is that false analogies aremade to the U.S. Supreme Court, which sees many more &quot;veryhard&quot; cases than do other courts, and thus resorts toideology more often.   Judge Edwards argues that his complaint isn't merely a petpeeve. Rather, he sees the misconceptions affecting somejudicial law clerks, who come to work assuming that their jobis to promote the judge's particular ideology. Even judges,he warns, &quot;may begin to believe what they hear and respondaccordingly.&quot;   If so, he suggests, constitutional and legal principles oflongstanding value may fall victim to short-term politicalgoals, at great cost to the justice system.                                                                                                          For homosexuals who want to keep their sexual orientationa secret, being &quot;outed&quot; by an advocacy group can causeserious personal trauma. An article in the December issue ofthe Georgetown Law Journal suggests a potential legal remedyfor some victims.   The legal problem with most so-called outings, writesRonald F. Wick, a student at the Georgetown University LawCenter, is that the victim ordinarily can't win a libel suitbecause truth is a complete defense in such a case.   But Mr. Wick suggests that the individual could build acase against those who unmask his or her sexual preference byturning to invasion-of-privacy law, which deals with publicdisclosure of private facts. Using a standard of &quot;reasonableexpectation of privacy,&quot; borrowed from the law governingunreasonable searches, would protect many homosexuals, Mr.Wick writes.   Even under such a law, though, celebrities and others inpositions of prominence still would lack protection, Mr. Wickadmits. Courts have long deemed prominent people to havefewer privacy rights than average citizens.   Some lawyers see potential in the idea. &quot;Where thehomosexuality is unrelated to public matters, a person mighthave a privacy claim,&quot; said Chad E. Milton, vice presidentand assistant general counsel for Media ProfessionalInsurance Group in Kansas City, Mo. So far, lawyers said, noouting cases have come to trial.   But the proposal's narrowness is its greatest flaw,lawyers say. In the vast majority of outing cases, someone'sprominence is the very reason he or she is exposed. The pointof outing generally is to spotlight a role model, althoughsometimes the campaign stems from what the accuser feels ishypocritical, anti-homosexual behavior. &quot;I can't think ofanyone who's not already prominent who has been outed,&quot; saidEvan Wolfson, a staff attorney for Lambda Legal Defense andEducation Fund, the country's largest legal organization forlesbians and gays. &quot;And sexual orientation increasingly isnot a private fact.&quot;   In addition, lawyers note, the success of such a claimwould depend on the state in which it is filed: Californiahas strong privacy laws, while New York doesn't.   Also in the December Georgetown Law Journal, two scholarsargue that African-Americans have a historical stake in theSecond Amendment right to bear arms. Robert J. Cottrol, anassociate law professor at Rutgers, and Raymond T. Diamond,an associate law professor at Tulane, trace the SecondAmendment's evolution and its significance to those who can'trely on government protection.   &quot;Much of the contemporary crime that concerns Americans isin poor black neighborhoods, and a case can be made thatgreater firearms restrictions might alleviate this tragedy,&quot;the authors write. &quot;But another, perhaps stronger case can bemade that a society with a dismal record of protecting peoplehas a dubious claim on the right to disarm them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
