The Miami-based carrier also intends to open a school for itsfirst group of 40 to 50 newly hired replacement pilots, Easternspokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said.   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern was forced to sit out what in yearspast has been one of its busiest, most profitable weekends.   Routes from the airline's Miami hub to the Northeast and fromFlorida to the Caribbean were the most heavily traveled on pastEaster weekends, ``and of course they're not running them now,''Ms. Ceremsak said Sunday.   Under orders from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S.District Judge Edward Davis scheduled new hearings in Miami todetermine whether the 3-week-old walkout by Eastern's 3,600 pilotsis a sympathy strike, as the pilots claim, or is a separate strikeseeking its own aims, as Eastern management contends.   Eastern asked a panel from the appeals court, meeting last weekin Tallahassee, to overturn Davis' earlier ruling that let the AirLine Pilots Association honor picket lines set up March 4 byEastern's Machinist union.   ALPA claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right toshow sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals courtagreed, but added that ``a claim of a sympathy strike cannot beused as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clearviolation of the Railway Labor Act.''   Eastern said if Davis finds that ALPA members stayed off the jobnot out of sympathy but primarily to pursue their own contractobjectives, without having exhausted all collective bargainingoptions under law, ``the court would be expected to order them backto work.''   The pilots, however, expressed cautious satisfaction with theappeals court move, noting that the judges denied Eastern's requestfor an immediate injunction.   The appeals court ruling Friday called on Davis to report backto the court after his hearings on the issue.   The pilots union Sunday also continued to downplay Eastern'sefforts to hire replacement pilots, saying there simply aren'tenough pilots to fill available airline slots, especially atEastern and Continential Airlines, the other carrier operated byFrank Lorenzo and his Houston-based Texas Air Corp.   ``Young pilots know better than to go to work for FrankLorenzo,'' said Capt. Jack Saux, a Delta Airlines pilot andchairman of ALPA's education committee. Saux said in a news releasethat he and other ALPA members have been meeting with pilots fromregional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots acrossthe nation.   ``If Eastern thinks these pilots will replace the strikingpilots at Eastern, they have another thing coming,'' Saux said.``We know these pilots and they know us. They understand what's atstake here.''</TEXT></DOC>
