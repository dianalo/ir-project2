The study by Signe Landgren of the Stockholm International PeaceResearch Institute says that although the South African armsindustry claims to be self-sufficient, it ``owes its existence toforeign technology,'' most of it acquired legally.   ``Arms and, increasingly, production know-how, have continued toreach South Africa, coming from the very Western countries thatagreed in the United Nations to abide by the arms embargorestrictions,'' Landgren says in the book ``EmbargoDisimplemented.''   The book lists the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan,France, Israel and Italy as having been among the most helpful.   Landgren said that no matter how inefficient, the embargoremains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed onSouth Africa and is valuable as a statement condemning thecountry's apartheid system of racial segregation.   In the latest example of Pretoria's cloak-and-daggeracquisitions, French police arrested three members of a NorthernIrish Protestant militia and a U.S. businessman on Saturday. Policesaid the four were delivering stolen parts of a British-madeBlowpipe missile launcher to a South African diplomat.   British news reports said the state-owned Armscor, the ArmamentsCorp. of South Africa, apparently supplied small arms or cash toProtestant extremists in exchange for blueprints of sophisticatedBritish weaponry.   The United Nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo on SouthAfrica on Aug. 7, 1963 and made it mandatory in 1977. Sanctionswere tightened in 1984 with a resolution discouraging countriesfrom buying South African-produced weapons.   The ban often was ineffective and had the countereffect ofspurring the South Africans to build up their own arms industry,the study said.   But it also deprived Pretoria of updated weapons systems,restricted its access to new technologies and curtailed the supplyof spare parts.   The embargo ``has been a limiting factor to some extent in SouthAfrica's efforts to expand its military strength,'' says the study,citing U.S. congressional testimony.   The study also quotes a 1985 U.N. report that says buyingsmuggled or black market weapons added 20 to 100 percent to thecountry's arms procurement costs.   Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies,using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations atsea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, it says.   The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilianproducts which have military applications, such as electronics andtelecommunications gear, the study says.   Nuclear technology was one area where the embargo failed to stopSouth African advances, it says.   It reports that by the time the United Nations ordered a halt tonuclear cooperation in 1977, South Africa had acquiredweapons-grade expertise to go with its vast uranium resources, theworld's second largest reserves.   ``Its possession of nuclear weapons remains an open question,but its capacity to produce such weapons is equal to that of almostany industrial nation in Europe,'' the book says.   Unlike Western restrictions on technology transfers to theSoviet bloc, no multinational organization exists to monitor theembargo against South Africa and there is no list of banned goodsto guide enforcement, Landgren wrote.   The 16-nation, Paris-based Coordinating Committee forMultinational Export Control _ COCOM _ set up in 1948, has a300,000-item list of military contraband, which could be appliedagainst South Africa, Landgren said.   South Africa's arms production capability was acquired throughlicensing agreements and by buying stakes in arms-makingmultinational companies, the study says.   In 1963, South Africa said it had 120 foreign licenses. Beforethe embargo became obligatory 14 years later, Pretoria gainedlicenses to produce weapons systems like the French Miragejetfighter, the Israeli Reshef gunboat and the Scorpion seamissile, also Israeli.   Equipped with the technology, the South Africans could continueproduction after the franchises were withdrawn.   One classic case of a clandestine acquisition was the G-5artillery piece, based on howitzers obtained from the U.S.-ownedSpace Research Corp. in Quebec, Canada and the Belgian PoudreriesReunis de Belgique.   The G-5 deal involved contacts through a CIA agent and Israeliintermediaries. South Africa bought a Dutch-based firm and createddummy companies in Liechtenstein, Barbados and Canada.   The first shells were bought from West Germany, bound for Spainand redirected to South Africa. Production lathes for the guns camefrom France, and the shell fillings were imported from West Germanyby way of Paraguay and Brazil. The G-5 technology was laterre-exported to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
