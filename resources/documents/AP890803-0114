After a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation, 46 traders at theChicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange were accusedof systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accountsand attempting to hide earnings from the Internal Revenue Service.   ``This probe is part of an expanding Department of Justicecrackdown on white-collar crime in all its various guises, fromWall Street to (Chicago's) LaSalle Street to Main Street with allstops in between,'' said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, whocame to Chicago to announce the indictments.   ``The activities uncovered at these exchanges, the largest oftheir type in the world, cannot be tolerated.''   The four separate indictments, covering 1,275 pages and hundredsof counts, allege that brokers trading for their own accounts aswell as customers' accounts systematically and illegally cheatedcustomers with the cooperation of ``locals'' _ traders trading onlyfor their own accounts.   Responding to a possible crisis of confidence, the MercantileExchange announced early today it had approved several rule changesand increased surveillance to better protect customers.   The most significant change will not go into effect withoutmembership approval, however. It would restrict dual trading, inwhich a trader is allowed to trade his own account as well as thoseof customers.   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, saidthe exchange hoped ``to put the fear of God'' into traders throughincreased scrutiny and stiffer penalties, including automaticexpulsion of any trader found guilty of a second offense involvinga customer's account.   The changes resulted from a comprehensive review of the exchangeconducted by a blue-ribbon panel appointed in January, when the FBIprobe was revealed.   Eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating thefederal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, whichcarries the stiffest penalties, up to 20 years in prison. Thesecharges also empower the government to freeze defendants' assetsbefore trial for seizure upon conviction.   Most of those indicted are charged with multiple counts such aspre-arranged trading, racketeering conspiracy and income tax fraudin schemes that allegedly bilked hundreds of customers out ofprofits in thousands of trades, said Valukas.   He wouldn't say how much money customers may have lost to thealleged fraud but called the amount ``significant.''   Fourteen of those charged have agreed to plead guilty andcooperate with investigators, according to government sources, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   Some futures traders and defense lawyers characterized most ofthose indicted as small-time players and guessed that thegovernment was using them to net bigger prey.   ``These appear to be small fish who extended the rules andregulations at times that Big Brother was watching,'' said onetrader who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Attorney Thomas Royce, representing indicted Japanese yenfutures trader Gary Wright, said he expects the investigation towiden.   `The government doesn't spend millions _ as they did here _ andbring in the attorney general and the FBI director if they're onlyseeking 46 guys,'' he said.   Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessions and Wendy Gramm,chairman of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, flewinto Chicago for the news conference.   Ms. Gramm called the indictments the ``first results of the mostextensive and aggressive law enforcement effort in the financialarea, ever.''   Four undercover FBI agents secretly tape-recorded, observed andeven participated on exchange floors in the illegal transactions,the indictments say.   Futures are contracts to buy or sell by a future date at aspecified price commodities and financial instruments such assoybeans, pork bellies, Treasury bonds and baskets of stocks.   The charges involve trading in the Swiss franc and Japanese yencurrency futures pits at the Chicago Merc and in the U.S. Treasurybond and soybean futures pits at the Board of Trade.   The exchanges were not accused of wrongdoing and neither wereany of the scores of brokerage firms whose customers were allegedlycheated.   Valukas said both exchanges ``when called upon provided fullassistance.''</TEXT></DOC>
