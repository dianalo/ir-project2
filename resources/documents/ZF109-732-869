 It's a reasonable reaction; Solbourne does indeed manufacture andmarket a line of processors based on Sun's Scalable Processor Architecture(SPARC) RISC chip.andP;  In some ways, Solbourne is reminiscent of Compaq in theearly days of the PC clone market.andP;  Solbourne is capitalizing on Sun'sgenerally available technology and stressing compatibility with Sun machines.andM;But the company deserves more recognition.andP;  Solbourne has distinguisheditself considerably by enhancing SPARC, especially with software--althoughit's made some worthwhile hardware contributions, too.andP;  In fact, when youtalk to Solbourne representatives about hardware issues, the conversationturns almost immediately to software.andP;  Processor design is one thing, butwhat system software comes with the machine?andP;  How robust is the operatingsystem?andP;  How many commercially available applications will run on themachine?andP;  How sophisticated is the development environment?andP;  Is the hardwaredesigned to meet the demands of the operating system?andM;With these questions in mind, Solbourne developed several technologies on topof Sun's basic platform to substantially enhance its performance and to makeit a more sophisticated environment.andP;  Among them:andM;* A symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operating system that is binarycompatible with SunOSandM;* A 64-bit SPARC version of the SPARC chipandM;* A flexible, toolkit-independent, X Window-based development environment,including the PEX 3-D graphics extensionandM;* A multiprocessor hardware architecture with a 64-bit system busandM;Solbourne was an early implementer of SMP, and its operating system isprobably its best-known software development.andP;  The company recognized earlyon the performance advantages of a multiprocessing operatingsystem--especially when dealing with distributed environments and complex,compute-intensive applications like imaging or transaction processing.andO;Solbourne is one of a handful of Unix vendors currently offering SMP.andP;  (Amongthe others: Pyramid, Corollary, Acer, Sequent, Data General, Arix,Hewlett-Packard, and, most recently, Digital Equipment.)andM;Still, the trend toward multiprocessing under Unix is a strong one thesedays.andP;  The industry's most influential organizations are campaigning heartilyfor the evolution of Unix to support multiprocessing.andP;  Both the Open SoftwareFoundation (OSF) and Unix International (UI) have organized special interestworkgroups to catalyze the development of multiprocessing Unix.andP;  OSF has goneso far as to adopt Mach--a research operating system built from scratch forparallel processing and multiprocessing.andP;  The Posix group has set up acommittee to form a portability standard for multithreaded platforms.andP;  Andthe Unix Software Lab (USL) has announced that it will be adding threads tothe standard System V.4 kernel.andP;  USL's first multiprocessing extensions aresupposed to appear next year, although a full implementation won't becomplete until 1992.andP;  Once these extensions are implemented, we expect manyUnix vendors to adopt them.andP;  (For a complete description and analysis ofmultiprocessing under Unix, see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2.)andM;Sun doesn't foresee a multiprocessing version of SunOS until 1992, givingSolbourne a chance to lure those who need the power and efficiency of an SMPmultiprocessor but who cling to Sun because of its large applicationbase--and because they already have so many Sun computers in-house.andP;  In fact,when we talked to Solbourne customers, Sun compatibility was stressed overand again as a motivating factor in their Solbourne purchases.andP;  &quot;Why buy aSun,&quot; one customer pointed out, &quot;when a Solbourne beats it inprice/performance and still runs my applications pretty cleanly?andP;  I don'thave to change my existing investment.&quot;andM;We hope Solbourne's price/performance advantage will gain more attention nowthat it has come out with a 64-bit SPARC chip.andP;  This puts Solbournedistinctly at the leading edge of RISC chip technology.andP;  Notice that we said&quot;RISC chip technology&quot;, not just SPARC chip technology.andP;  Other RISCdesigns--IBM's RS/6000, MIPS Computer's R series (adopted by Digital),Intel's i860, Motorola's 88000 (adopted by a handful of vendors, includingData General), and Hewlett-Packard's HP-PA--are 32-bit implementations,although we do expect them all to reach 64 bits at some point.andP;  In themeantime, Solbourne's chip reaches 40 MIPS and 20 MFLOPS with a 40 MHz clockspeed.andP;  Impressive numbers.andP;  Solbourne admits that these are onlypeak-performance figures.andP;  The chip is currently used only in Solbourne'suniprocessor and runs at 25.5 MIPS.andM;Innovation on Borrowed TechnologyandM;Solbourne's first workstation line appeared just last year, and the companyitself is only four years old, which may make you wonder how it came up withso many technical advances so quickly.andP;  Solbourne has taken an interestingapproach to innovation.andP;  Rather than pouring time and money into buildingsystems from scratch, Solbourne licensed technology from Sun, thereby freeingup its development staff to focus on specific enhancements.andP;  It leapfroggedover base platform development and went straight to work on what it correctlysensed were important market directions, namely: multiprocessing, improvedprice/performance, and sophisticated graphical user interface technology.andM;At a time when the computer industry is more concerned with standardizationthan ever, Solbourne's seems the competitive model to watch.andP;  Solbourne isevidence that you certainly can innovate on existing, widely adoptedtechnology; that you can react quickly to market trends; that standards can,in fact, be as advantageous to vendors as they are to users.andM;CHALLENGING SUN'S STRATEGY.andP;  Sun has always left most of its developmentsopen and licensable, the purpose being to saturate the market with itstechnology until it all becomes a de facto standard, as its Network FileSystem (NFS) has.andP;  From Sun's perspective, the more clones out there, thebetter; clones simply validate its efforts.andM;But, when we look at the way Solbourne has leveraged Sun's technology, wecan't help but doubt Sun's endeavors.andP;  Solbourne's model is a challenge toSun's strategy.andP;  It makes you realize that a clone manufacturer has thepotential to beat Sun at its own game.andP;  Solbourne has licensed a good dealmore from Sun than just SPARC; it also has SunOS, NFS, Open Network Computing(ONC), NeWS, and Sun View, as well as a few Sun graphics products.andP;  Thus, Sunhas, in effect, paid for much of Solbourne's development costs, whileSolbourne has implemented sophisticated multiprocessors that beat Sun'soriginals in terms of price/performance.andP;  If Solbourne keeps up this trend,its workstations could eventually outsell Sun's.andP;  &quot;Could&quot; is the operativeword here.andP;  Currently, Solbourne doesn't come close to Sun's market share.andO;However, that could change.andP;  Just because Sun invented the technology doesn'tguarantee it first place.andP;  Its licensing strategy invites clone-makers todirect competition and forces Sun to carry a burden of rapid innovation.andP;  IfSun slips, companies like Solbourne will be quick to take advantage.andM;Some BackgroundandM;Solbourne was founded four years ago by Douglas MacGregor (who, incidentally,was the principal designer of the Motorola 68020 chip).andP;  Over 50 percent ofSolbourne is owned by Matsushita Electronic Industrial Company, which youprobably know better as Panasonic, Technics, and Quasar.andP;  Matsushita grantedMacGregor both an initial $11.75 million Randamp;D investment in 1986, and thenanother $38.9 million in start-up funding for the company.andM;The financial relationship between the two organizations is ideal forSolbourne.andP;  On one hand, it has the deep-pocketed backing of a majorinternational electronics company that provides access to the Japanese andAsian markets.andP;  On the other, it's a small startup that can spot and respondquickly to market directions.andM;But Solbourne considers Matsushita more of a partner than a financier.andO;Matsushita lends Solbourne the advantage of its reputable engineeringexpertise, and the two companies have already worked together on developmentprojects, one of which resulted in the 64-bit SPARC chip.andP;  Moreover, we can'thelp but notice a Japanese flavor to the Solbourne model we described above.andO;The Japanese are known for taking existing technology and making it better,cheaper, and/or faster, and Solbourne is very much in keeping with thistradition.andP;  With the exception of the 64-bit SPARC chip, not one of itsfeatures is, in itself, unique.andP;  Rather it's the collection andimplementation of features that make Solbourne's offering so compelling.andM;Solbourne currently employs over 300 people, most of whom are situated at itsworldwide headquarters in Longmont, Colorado.andM;CORPORATE GOALS.andP;  Solbourne actually reached its primary goal earlier thisyear when it came out with a 25.5 MIPS workstation for under $10,000.andP;  Costand performance are the company's motivating factors, and its long-term planis to simultaneously decrease prices and increase MIPS.andP;  Solbourne feels thatits strongest potential lies in the low-end desktop market--especially duringthe next few years.andP;  We agree.andP;  The market is ripe for 100 MIPS desktops--thecheaper the better.andM;Solbourne also stresses its commitment to standards--at least thosesanctioned by Unix International.andP;  The company actually mimics Sun in regardto standards.andP;  So, for instance, since Sun is migrating to System V.4 (SVR4),Solbourne is, too.andP;  Likewise, it plans to stay with ONC rather thanincorporate the OSF's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) selections(unless, of course, Sun surprises us all and adopts them itself).andM;Solbourne's fidelity to Sun seems short-sighted.andP;  At the moment, Sun hascornered the Unix workstation market.andP;  This year, it will have soldapproximately 170,000 workstations.andP;  That's more than the next threecompetitors combined.andP;  (Hewlett-Packard is a distant second, with anestimated 75,000.)andP;  But we seriously doubt that Sun will be able to keep upsuch a ratio when other major vendors have begun offering such promising RISCplatforms.andP;  Solbourne is putting all its eggs in Sun's basket, and that'srisky (no pun intended).andM;RELATIONSHIP WITH SUN.andP;  Doug MacGregor describes Solbourne's relationshipwith Sun as &quot;cooperative, collaborative, yet competitive.&quot;andP;  In a way,Solbourne legitimizes Sun's efforts to push its technology as de factostandards.andP;  Solbourne is a champion for Sun's SPARC chip, and is certainlybroadening the SPARC market.andP;  Furthermore, as we've pointed out, Solbournehas made SPARC the first RISC design to reach 64 bits.andM;On the other hand, Solbourne competes head-to-head with Sun's SPARCstationline.andP;  Solbourne already has made more than $50 million in resellercommitments both in the United States and overseas.andP;  And for good reason.andO;Solbourne claims that its processors are ahead of their Sun counterparts inprice/performance by as much as 20 percent.andP;  Solbourne's technical advantagesand multiprocessing architecture are also attracting would-be Sun customers.andO;For instance, Nexgen, a computer company out of San Jose, California, isusing Solbourne computers for modeling and CASE applications.andP;  Nexgen'sDirector of Software, Ashok Jain, pointed primarily to multiprocessing as thedeciding factor in his Solbourne purchases: &quot;We have over 35 gigabytes ofonline data, so we needed systems with a lot of memory and disk space.andP;  Butthe scalability and power of muliprocessing were the main reason for buyingSolbournes.andP;  We simply need to run more than one job at a time.&quot;andM;Marketing StrategyandM;Solbourne is promoting its processors as powerful yet affordable computersand is specifically targeting the engineering and manufacturing markets.andP;  Aswe said earlier, this competes head-to-head with Sun--and the other RISCvendors as well.andM;Considering how hot the RISC market is, Solbourne has its work cut out todistinguish itself.andP;  Think for a minute about the big names vying for RISCcontention: IBM, Digital, Hewlett-Packard, Data General, Sun.andP;  It may be hardfor Solbourne to make its mark.andP;  We weren't just being glib in our earlierreference to Solbourne's reputation as a mere Sun clone.andP;  Solbourne'sdevelopments are noteworthy, but the company will have to be aggressive ingetting that message across.andP;  Moreover, Solbourne will have to keep on itstoes.andP;  Other vendors are not far behind the company's current technology.andM;At first, we thought Solbourne might have a real door-opener with its newlow-end offering, which starts at $8,995.andP;  But, by now, most of the big-nameRISC product lines have broken the $10,000 barrier.andP;  (We couldn't have saidthat a few months ago; it's amazing how quickly things change in thismarket.)andP;  On the other hand, Solbourne's low-end machine features the 64-bitchip, which makes it not only the sole 64-bit RISC workstation for under$10,000, but the sole 64-bit RISC workstation, period.andP;  Solbourne iscorrectly promoting this fact in its marketing campaign.andM;Another sell for Solbourne is the number of commercial applications itsupports.andP;  Solbourne computers can run SPARC applications and give them thepower of a multiprocessing architecture--an advantage other SPARCimplementers cannot claim.andP;  Although there are over 2,100 SPARC applicationsin Sun's catalogue, Solbourne customers claim that some go a little buggy ona Solbourne.andP;  Solbourne, meanwhile, is counting on SPARC applicationscompatibility because of their very volume.andP;  Thus, Solbourne has put togethera verification program for SPARC applications, and 500 of them have passedcleanly.andM;The fly in the ointment is Sun itself.andP;  Sun runs all 2,100 of thoseapplications, and it also has name recognition.andP;  In addition, Sun recentlyannounced a $4,995 SPARCstation.andP;  Talk about a door-opener.andP;  Again, Solbourneis stressing its technical strengths as well as its price/performance marksto make a dent in Sun's market share.andM;DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.andP;  Although it has relied almost solely on direct salesto market its processors up until now, Solbourne plans to make better use ofthird-party and OEM channels.andP;  Apparently, Solbourne thought it made moresense to sell its predominantly server product line directly, and the companyset sales offices in San Jose, Chicago, Boston, Denver, Syracuse,Minneapolis, Dallas, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles.andP;  But its newestworkstation was designed to be much more user installable and maintainablethan its previous offerings, making it more appropriate for alternativedistribution channels.andM;SERVICE AND SUPPORT.andP;  Solbourne claims to have a superior service and supportstrategy--a claim that was substantiated each time we talked to a Solbournecustomer.andP;  Users noted the expertise of the company's support staff as wellas its quick response to their problems.andP;  Each product comes with a one-year,onsite, extended warranty that includes parts, labor, installation, training,and access to its user response center.andP;  For optional software products,Solbourne offers phone support and software updates.andP;  Comparatively speaking,the length and breadth of Solbourne's service coverage is very good.andP;  Mostmanufacturers offer 90 days or less.andM;One convenience mentioned by more than one customer is that the workstationsoftware comes preinstalled.andP;  Furthermore, a member of the support stafffinishes the installation job and solves any problems that come up after thesystem arrives.andP;  Nice touches--especially on a Unix platform, whereinstallation can be a painstaking process.andM;Hardware ArchitectureandM;Solbourne has an assortment of hardware platforms, ranging from X terminalsto high-end servers, that can be transparently mixed and matched with Suncomputers across a network, and programs written for SPARCstations will alsorun on Solbournes.andM;As concerned as Solbourne is with SPARC compatibility, it is also concernedwith performance.andP;  The company has progressed nicely here so far.andP;  Itscurrent second generation of SPARC computers just about doubles theperformance ratios of its first generation.andP;  In other words, Solbournedoubled its price/performance in a year.andP;  That's a good pace, and one that itshould continue if it wants to stay competitive in the RISC market.andM;Until recently, Solbourne played in the mid- to high-end market withmultiprocessor servers and workstations (in addition to X terminals).andO;Solbourne's first product line, introduced in January 1989, was the Series4.andO;The line was modeled after the Sun4 and contained two workstations and threeservers, with MIPS ranging from 17 to 30.andP;  Late last year, however, Solbournereleased its second product line--the Series5--which completely blew away theSeries4 in terms of price/performance.andP;  The company, therefore, dropped theSeries4 line.andP;  (Series4 users can upgrade to a Series5--or futuregenerations--simply by swapping CPU boards.)andP;  It rounded out its productoffering in October by introducing the S4000, a low-end uniprocessor SPARCworkstation.andP;  So, aside from its original Series4 line, Solbourne has fourproduct families out in the market:andM;* X Display Stations, both color and monochrome, which have been OEM's fromNCD.andM;* Series 5 multiprocessor workstations and servers, Solbourne's premiereproduct line.andP;  The series includes two workstations and three servers andranges from 22 to 65 MIPS.andM;* Series5E/900 Server, the so-called &quot;Enterprise Server.&quot;andP;  It can hold up to8 CPUs, each running at 31 MIPS, and can support as many as 150 users.andM;* S4000 Workstation, a uniprocessor that features the 64-bit SPARC chip.andM;We've already told you that Solbourne uses most of Sun's technology as itsplatform base.andP;  But Solbourne's specific developments better leverage SPARCfor multiprocessing as well as for multimedia applications, and these deservediscussion.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andM;64-BIT BUS ARCHITECTURE.andP;  Many RISC designs are abandoning 32-bitarchitectures because they're simply  not fast enough.andP;  Solbourne is noexception.andP;  Its multiprocessors are based on a 64-bit &quot;Kbus&quot; architecturethat transfers data among memory, the operating system, and processors at arate of 128 Mbps.andP;  That's fast enough to take on several processors atonce--at least eight, according to Solbourne.andP;  The Kbus is a backplane busfor processing and memory.andP;  The Kbus board has a floating point processor (33MHz or 40 MHz, depending on the model) with integer units and a 128KBphysical cache.andM;For I/O, Solbourne includes a 7-slot VMEbus.andP;  Other systems use the VMEbus,and its 25 Mbps performance is adequate but not terribly impressive.andP;  We'venoticed some vendors putting a lot of development time into very fast I/Obuses--and so they should.andP;  An I/O bus needs to keep up with fast processorsand multiple CPUs; otherwise, it invites bottlenecks.andP;  A well-designed I/Obus running double the speed of the VMEbus can really improve performance.andM;(We should point out that the KBus is used by Solbourne'smultiprocessors--not the S4000 uniprocessor, which has its own 64-bitarchitecture.andP;  See &quot;Hardware Line,&quot; page 8.)andM;64-BIT SPARC.andP;  We talked earlier about Solbourne's desire to milk the low-endRISC market, and the new 64-bit SPARC chip is an attempt to do just that.andO;The chip has certainly given Solbourne some commercial attention.andP;  But, moreto the point, Solbourne asserts that it was designed and optimized forlow-cost workstations.andP;  For instance, it has a higher level of integrationthan the chips Solbourne uses for its other processors, tying together theCPU, floating point, memory management, and cache right in the chip.andO;Furthermore, it only runs on the S4000.andM;Solbourne worked with Matsushita on the MN10501 chip design (it carries thePanasonic brand name).andP;  It rates at 40 MIPS and 20 MFLOPS.andP;  The chip is aCMOS implementation with one million transistors and an integral floatingpoint unit that operates in parallel with an integer unit.andP;  Data pathways of64 bits and a 40 MHz clock speed offer a substantial performance boost, asdoes the reduction of the clock's per load/store instructions, which,Solbourne claims, can make up to 15 to 20 percent of a given program.andM;Since the chip has such a different design and purpose from its otherimplementations, customers will probably not be upgrading to the MN10501.andO;The boards of the S4000 are different from the boards of the Series4,Series5, or Series5E.andP;  However, it's quite feasible that Solbourne willupgrade the chips of its multiprocessors when more appropriate 64-bit SPARCimplementations become available.andP;  (No word from Solbourne on whether or notit would develop such an implementation itself.)andM;MEMORY.andP;  One of the hardware distinctions between Sun and Solbourne isSolbourne's use of Error Corrections Circuitry (ECC) memory for its high-endserver products, which detects and often corrects double-bit errors.andP;  Sunuses parity-checking, which can only detect single-bit errors.andP;  Essentially,ECC memory makes a system more reliable--especially in large-memoryconfigurations.andM;GRAPHICS.andP;  If Solbourne's goal is to capture engineers and developers,high-performance graphics are a must.andP;  Not only has the company developed anintriguing X software environment, the added performance of multiprocessingis well-suited for graphical and multimedia applications.andP;  The color displaysand X terminals offer 256 of 16 million colors with a minimum of 1152-by-900pixels.andM;The S4000 has more advanced graphics features than the rest of Solbourne'sproduct line, boasting support for PEX (PHIGS Extension to the X WindowSystem), a 3-D graphics API that has been sanctioned by both the X Consortiumand ANSI/ISO.andP;  The S4000 also has the advantage of Solbourne's GraphicsAccelerator (SGA), which has a library of X, PEX, and Pixrects graphicsprimitives that write directly to the graphics hardware, and it therebyoffloads the system CPU, which speeds up performance.andP;  Developers workingwith PEX and 3-D might be interested in the optional Z-buffer board, whichaccelerates hidden surface removal (i.e., erasing the back lines of, say, acube or a cylinder).andP;  3-D modeling is an expensive, compute-intensiveprocess, and accelerator boards are essential for those that deal with 3-Dextensively.andM;System SoftwareandM;Solbourne has put together a credible hardware architecture, and the companyhas definitely matched its hardware design with its software environment.andO;Again, Solbourne started out with some of Sun's base technology: the Sunoperating system, user interface technology (SunView and NeWS), networkingsoftware (ONC as well as TCP/IP and Ethernet), and graphics software (Sun CGIand SunCore).andP;  Then if figured out how to improve upon it, starting out byconverting the operating system to support multiprocessing.andP;  It also addedsome really productive features to the X development environment, as well astoolkit independence--and, given the stormy graphical user interface climatE,this is a salient point.andM;SMP.andP;  Solbourne's SMP operating system, OS/SMP, is a multiprocessing versionof SunOS.andP;  Essentially, Solbourne has implemented a multithreaded kernel sothat multiple CPUs can execute shared kernel code concurrently.andM;There are various approaches to multiprocessing, and Solbourne originallychose a master/slave MP implementation--sort of halfway between asymmetricand full symmetric multiprocessing, where one processor assigns tasks to theother processors.andP;  It's now a full symmetric implementation, and all CPUs areequal.andP;  The design depends on load-balancing and shared memory.andM;The standard Unix kernel doesn't easily adapt itself to symmetricalmultiprocessing.andP;  A number of operating system features and utilities needtweaking before they'll allow multiple jobs to run simultaneously.andP;  Solbournehas modified a few SunOS utilities to support parallel tasks:andM;* The Unix domain sockets allow pipe operations to run concurrently onmultiple processors.andP;  The object here is speed.andP;  In a typical uniprocessordesign, a lot of times is wasted waiting for suspended processes and buffercomplications.andP;  With multiprocessing, a process can run on a CPU; there isless need for suspended processes and buffers at all.andM;* A parallelized Sun make utility, or pmake.andP;  Make is used to performmultiple compiles and links.andP;  In Solbourne's version, those multiple compilesand links run in parallel on different processors.andP;  Again, the issue isspeed.andP;  In a simple scenario, if you have 10 compiles to do and 10 CPUs, eachCPU can handle each compile, thus cutting processing time by a factor of 10.andM;Solbourne's hardware structure also plays a critical role in thefunctionality of OS/SMP.andP;  Its multiprocessors were designed to let all CPUsperform simultaneously within the kernel.andP;  Also, the CPUs share a singleversion of the operating system, so adding or removing processors doesn'taffect the kernel.andP;  The machines also feature physical caches, which helpguarantee consistency in a multiprocessor environment.andP;  And, of course, the64-bit system bus offers a wider data path to keep multiple processes movingsteadily.andM;USER INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY.andP;  A few vendors have bridged the whole GUI issue bydeveloping user interface toolkits that support both Motif and OpenLook.andO;Solbourne is among them.andP;  Its Object Interface (OI) Library offers developersa single programing interface for both Motif and OpenLook (or, conceivably,any other X-based toolkit).andP;  Solbourne is licensing OI;its first licensee wasATandamp;T.andM;Applications are written using objects in an OI class library.andP;  OI has ageneric object model: Each OI object is linked to both an OpenLook and aMotif counterpart (see Illustration 3).andP;  Thus, developers only write to thatgeneric OI API, and the application objects are bound to either OpenLook orMotif instantiations at run-time (i.e., they become either OpenLook or Motifat run-time)andM;To accommodate both OpenLook and Motif, Solbourne had to fudge a few objecttranslations.andP;  OI is actually a combination of the functionality of the twotoolkits.andP;  Therefore, it is a superset of the objects that you'll find ineither OpenLook or Motif alone.andP;  If an OpenLook object, for instance, has noobvious Motif counterpart, OI extends the Motif look and feel by using one ofits superset objects.andP;  Still, we think that Solbourne has taken the righttack by supplying a superset rather than a subset of OpenLook/Motiffunctionality.andP;  We've seen other toolkit-independent solutions suffer thelowest-common-denominator syndrome, where too much functionality gets lost intranslating applications from one user interface to the next.andM;Built on C++.andP;  Although OI uses X as its underlying window system, its objectlibrary is based on C++ rather than C, which is what most X toolkits use.andO;(Solbourne has its own version of ATandamp;T's C++, which translates into C sourcecode for use with OS/SMP.)andP;  C++ makes for a more robust objectenvironment--more logical and pliable.andP;  OI, for instance, features dynamicreparenting, which, essentially, lets subobjects be reused by differentobject parents--even parents that have been destroyed.andP;  This is a very usefulfunction.andP;  If, for example, you build a menu object containing submenus (suchas Index, Commands, Functions, Templates, etc.), and later decide to trashit, the submenus can live in an &quot;orphanage&quot; for use later.andM;The X Window Development Environment.andP;  Solbourne's X environment wasgenerated with the OI Library, and it contains a number of X applications.andO;Solbourne has its own window manager that can be configured to emulateMotif's or OpenLook's (as well as TWM, the standard window manager that comeswith X).andP;  It also has a smattering of desktop accessories, such as a mailtool, a Unix news reader, a directory browser, a calendar, and a window debugtool.andM;But a few other features are particularly valuable:andM;* Virtual Desktop, which makes the X root window larger than the physicallimits of the display.andP;  Once the root window is expanded, you can scrollthrough it and can put together a &quot;rooms&quot; type of environment, where groupsof related windows can be moved into their own area on the expanded desktop.andO;Or you can make use of &quot;sticky&quot; windows--windows that don't move as theVirtual Desktop is scrolled.andP;  Sticky windows are handy for moving to adifferent area or room without leaving a preexisting environment, or if youwant to keep a standard environment (e.g., a clock, a mail notifier, etc.)andO;visible at all times.andM;* Hypertext Help.andP;  We spent some time looking at the OI Help system, and wewere duly impressed.andP;  Each Help item includes additional menu items forreaching extra information--subtopics or related topics.andP;  But a few elementsof the Help system are particularly useful.andP;  One is its degree of contextsensitivity.andP;  If you have Help running in a visible window, you can watch theHelp window change according to what you're doing.andP;  Another is that thesample objects within a Help item are real objects--not just bit-mappedrepresentations.andP;  For instance, the scrollbar Help item includes a samplescrollbar that actually scrolls.andP;  Very nicely implemented.andP;  Verysophisticated.andP;  (See Illustration 4.)andM;* A symbolic debugger, providing point-and-click kernel debug support fornetworked and multiprocessing applications.andM;One thing you won't find on a Solbourne computer is a desktop manager (a laOpenWindows, Looking Glass, or MacFinder, for example).andP;  In a way, this is inkeeping with Solbourne's target customers of engineers and developers.andO;Frankly, we don't know many Unix developers who want their utilities hiddenbehind a graphical user interface (which is what a desktop manager does).andP;  Onthe other hand, more and more commercial users are getting interested inthese so-called &quot;engineering workstations.&quot;andP;  Solbourne assured us that itdoesn't want to neglect these potential commercial customers.andP;  In fact, itsmost recent workstation offering was designed for a lower-tech user than itsother products.andP;  Ideally, Solbourne would like its workstation to be &quot;easyenough for the desktop of a shipping clerk.&quot;andP;  It might start by adding adesktop management component.andM;NETWORKING.andP;  It seems that Solbourne's primary goal for its networking schemeis to adhere to Sun's networking scheme.andP;  Networking is one piece of Suntechnology that Solbourne has licensed but hasn't touched.andP;  Solbourne doesadd to the network environment its multiprocessing architecture, which isreally ideal for distributed computing.andP;  Extra processors are clearlyadvantageous for Solbourne as a compute server in a distributed environment.andM;However, as we said earlier, Solbourne is putting a lot of faith in Sun'sability to forge a networking standard.andP;  OSF's DCE selections have beenwell-received, and, although Sun is in the midst of rebuilding ONC, thecurrent ONC basket of products doesn't match the scope of OSF's offering.andM;FuturesandM;Solbourne is rather tight-lipped when it comes to discussing companydirections.andP;  While it does plan on a new generation of processors--theSeries6--it wouldn't give us any hints at what kind of performance to expector an estimated time of arrival.andP;  Likewise, the company implied that it mayexpand the S4000 workstation line to include server and lower-cost machines(we hope that means an under-$5,000 machine), but again, no details.andM;We did talk a bit about Solbourne's software--especially its operating systemin light of the new multiprocessing extensions announced by USL.andP;  Solbourneplans to migrate to SVR4 and to adopt the extensions if they do indeed becomestandard.andP;  It doesn't foresee much trouble with the extensions, becauseOS/SMP added no system calls or extensions of its own that would causeincompatibility.andM;CommentsandM;Our interest in Solbourne stems more from its strategic model than anythingelse.andP;  Solbourne is doing many things right: eliminating a great deal ofdevelopment time and money by adopting an established and readily availablebase platform; focusing on specific market directions; and distinguishingitself with leading-edge technology like multiprocessing, speedy chip design,and flexible user interface technology.andM;A company like Solbourne could do very well or it could hobble.andP;  Its successdepends largely on Sun.andP;  As long as Sun maintains its status, Solbourne cancontinue to finesse Sun's developments.andP;  Solbourne has a lot of opportunityhere.andP;  Sun seems to be in the cumbersome position of trying to do it all, andit may have trouble keeping up, much less keeping ahead.andP;  Solbourne, on theother hand, is borrowing as much technology as it can, thereby affordingitself the flexibility to develop leading-edge enhancements.andM;However, if the RISC market continues to spawn a number of differentcompetitive architectures, Solbourne stands less of a chance.andP;  Solbourne isbanking on SPARC to be the single prominent player, and there's a real dangerin that.andM;TOWARDS SYSTEM CUSTOMIZATION.andP;  We alluded earlier to a Japanese flair to theway Solbourne is doing business.andP;  In some ways, we see in Solbourne thepotential for a level of customization that Japanese auto makers arebeginning to reach.andP;  Mazda engineers, for instance, actually recorded exhaustsounds of classic sports cars--trying over 100 combinations--to fine-tune theengine sound of the Miata.andM;While the computer industry has yet to approach a comparable level ofcustomization, some vendors are at least zeroing in on precise technologydevelopments necessary to a distinct audience.andP;  In Solbourne's case, theaudience is made up of engineers and developers who have an installed base ofSun computers and applications, but who are working with robust applicationsthat demand multiprocessing.andM;Still, computers are, by-and-large, general purpose machines.andP;  Yet, few usersneed a system that does it all--from communication, to number-crunching, tographics.andP;  Ideally, systems would be designed and optimized for specificpurposes, yet interoperable.andP;  Your network manager, for instance, may need aspecialized communication machine.andP;  A graphic artist may want a machine withan extra-wide screen and stylus.andM;Although such systems may not be looming on the horizon, intermediate systemdevelopments are.andP;  Consider, for instance, specialized network servers (e.g.,andO;for printing, imaging, faxing, database retrieval, number-crunching, etc.)andO;that can be mixed and matched as users need them.andP;  Or low-cost custom chips(e.g., protocol, inference engine, and operating system chips).andP;  This is thekind of progress we anticipate within the next few years, because it isattention to such pockets of technology that will differentiate vendors in anera of standardization.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
