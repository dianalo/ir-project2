In fact, he has been declining to give interviews, on any subject, for months. That is unusual for Mr. Turner, who is, after all, in the communications business and has, for most of his life, commented loudly on whatever interested him.    On the other hand, you might not talk to reporters either if, in the space of a year, you had lost $25 million on an ersatz Olympics that few people watched, lost your house in a fire, bought MGM at a price that made securities analysts laugh, been vilified publicly by Woody Allen, gone $1.4 billion into debt, separated from your wife and been dunned by the Internal Revenue Service.    Such a string of misfortunes is hard to top, but Mr. Turner has done it: On Wednesday, he, in effect, gave up control of his life's work. In exchange for the money to stabilize his debt problems, he granted a group of cable-television operators, including Time Inc., broad authority to oversee -- and if necessary to veto -- the management decisions of Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the empire that he built from a billboard company.    Some who know him say it was inevitable. &quot;Every time he did something, he put all his chips on the table and rolled the dice,&quot; says Irwin Mazo, a Savannah investor who worked for Mr. Turner and was a friend of his father's. &quot;Sooner or later, he had to crap out.&quot;    But it wasn't just a bad gamble. Last October, Mr. Turner turned over day-to-day management of the company to a five-man executive committee. He has been devoting energy to the Better World Society, an organization that he founded two years ago to promote global harmony through television. Nearing age 50, he is working on an autobiography, and he is spending much of his time in California with a woman who was once his pilot. The nation, evidently, is about to witness the transformation of one of its wackier symbols.    &quot;I would say maybe he is beginning to wonder what he's going to do when he grows up,&quot; says James Roddey, a former Turner Broadcasting executive and sailing partner of Mr. Turner.    For more than 20 years, Mr. Turner used his jerry-built company like a pirate vessel, staging raids, accumulating wealth, forcing people to take notice. Along the way, he became a hero to some, a boob to others, the brashest of entrepreneurs in an entrepreneurial age.    Mr. Turner was an object of fascination for the peculiarly adolescent reason that he got away with things. As long as he was defending the America's Cup or buying a baseball team or starting a new TV service, he could be quoted as making anti-Semitic wisecracks and still be considered a role model by college students. His unofficial contract with the public let him be ridiculous or obnoxious as long as he remained an underdog who won his battles.    Which he did, until he sailed into New York Harbor two years ago and aimed his guns at CBS Inc. Then, his current troubles began.    Mr. Turner's hostile, $5.41 billion, junk-bond offer for the network was his most spectacular raid to date, and it was typically outrageous: an offer to buy a company much bigger than his own without using any money. CBS took it seriously, though; after all, Mr. Turner -- against all odds -- already had changed the TV industry with his satellite &quot;superstation&quot; and his Cable News Network. With a $954.8 million stock buyback, CBS killed the offer and handed him his biggest defeat.    Repelled by CBS, Mr. Turner sailed west to buy MGM, with its large film library, from investor Kirk Kerkorian. By the time the deal was done, Turner Broadcasting had borrowed $1.4 billion to acquire MGM/UA Entertainment Co., sold the UA part back to Mr. Kerkorian for $470.2 million and issued a new class of preferred stock, half of which went to Mr. Kerkorian. As one analyst put it, Mr. Turner went to Hollywood &quot;fully clothed and left in a barrel.&quot;    And in the barrel was a bomb, with a slow-burning fuse. The bomb was preferred stock that was to pay dividends in common shares beginning this month; unless redeemed, it could eventually have reduced Mr. Turner's common-stock holdings from 80% currently to a minority. To prevent that, Turner Broadcasting on Wednesday sold two new classes of preferred shares, amounting to 37% of the company's voting stock, to the cable companies for $562.5 million. The company will use the money to redeem the original preferred shares June 18.    Mr. Turner still owns 51% of his company's voting stock, and he remains chairman. But the board has been expanded to 15 members, and the cable operators have elected seven of them. A super-majority of 12 directors will be required to approve each item of the annual budget. The super-majority will also be required to approve acquisitions, asset sales, borrowings, refinancings, amendments to bylaws, dividends, top-level executive changes and anything that isn't in the budget and costs more than $2 million.    Furthermore, if Turner Broadcasting doesn't bring its remaining debt problems under control within a year, the cable companies get an outright majority of the board. And if Mr. Turner decides to sell his stake, they have the right of first refusal to buy it. (If that happened, Time Inc. would get responsibility for day-to-day management of the company.)    &quot;It's clear from the transaction as it's structured -- and I think it's an economic fact of life -- that Ted no longer owns the company,&quot; says William Bevins, Turner Broadcasting's chief financial officer.    That leaves Mr. Turner playing constitutional monarch -- a role to which he is perfectly unsuited. &quot;It would be my guess that Ted will either sell out and get out of {the company} or mount a campaign to get it back,&quot; Mr. Roddey says. &quot;I just don't see him maintaining that status quo.&quot;    Mr. Turner is accustomed to managing by fiat. A case in point is the creation of the Goodwill Games, which last summer brought U.S. and Soviet athletes together after boycotts had kept them apart for two successive Olympic Games. &quot;Ted was in his office one day in the summer of '84 watching the ABC broadcast of the Olympics,&quot; says John Bevilaqua, a consultant who was involved in the Goodwill Games. &quot;He called {Executive Vice President} Bob Wussler into his office and said, 'Hey, Bob, why can't we do something like this with the Soviets?' . . . Ted gets credit for the idea, but Bob and his team get credit for the execution.&quot;    William Sanders, Mr. Bevins's predecessor, adds: &quot;There are times when it appears that Ted Turner overpays for things, because he's not the type to try to negotiate the last nickel out of a deal. He says, 'This is a deal we want, let's get it.'&quot;    It is that intuitive approach to business, combined with Mr. Turner's grim tenacity, that has given Turner Broadcasting its peculiar shape. Mr. Turner built an edifice without really nailing it together; he balanced its parts precariously, making sure that the stresses offset one another. The financial community stood around waiting for it to fall down, but it just kept getting bigger.    Mr. Turner started with a billboard company at age 24. His father had sold the business and then committed suicide, but Mr. Turner managed to get it back. He bought more billboard companies, then a radio station, then four more radio stations, then a television station, then another, then a baseball team and a basketball team to televise. Then, he had his TV signal beamed around the country via satellite, and he started two cable-TV services. At each step of the way, he was leveraged to the eyeballs.    &quot;The company has almost never had any earnings,&quot; Mr. Sanders says. &quot;Ted has never had, as his primary objective, generating earnings. His primary objective has been to build value, and he's done a very good job of that&quot; -- even if Mr. Turner had to appear on TV and ask viewers to send money to keep a station afloat, as he once did in Charlotte, N.C. (He later sent the money back.)    Turner Broadcasting still doesn't have any earnings, but the cable companies' willingness to invest half a billion dollars in it testifies to the value Mr. Turner has built. WTBS, his &quot;superstation,&quot; had revenue of $207.6 million last year, and the company's two cable services, Cable News Network and CNN Headline News, had combined revenue of $171.8 million. The MGM film library, too, is valuable to the cable companies -- even if Woody Allen thinks that trying to increase its value by adding color to old movies is &quot;sinful,&quot; as he told a congressional committee. Although Mr. Turner's Atlanta Braves baseball team is a steady money-loser, the Atlanta Hawks, his basketball team, may chalk up a profit next season for the first time. (The IRS says Turner Broadcasting owes $1,280,000 and Mr. Turner owes $250,031 in back taxes on the teams, however; both have challenged the assessments in tax court.)    Wall Street welcomed the cable operators' investment. When rumors of the transaction first arose in January, the company's common shares jumped from $14 a share to $18 in three days. The stock gradually rose a bit and closed yesterday at $20.75, unchanged on the day.    &quot;When the cable operators more or less came to the rescue, the stock made a big move,&quot; says Elizabeth Ingersoll, an analyst at Wood Gundy Corp. in New York. But until investors see what is done with the company's remaining debt, she says, &quot;people are taking a wait-and-see attitude.&quot;    The cable companies want Turner Broadcasting for its programming. Thus, they will keep the edifice from collapsing and will prevent Mr. Turner from deciding, say, to finance a satellite channel beamed to extraterrestrials. &quot;The major decisions, such as a CBS, an MGM acquisition, a Goodwill Games, those things will be given the same type of consideration at the board level that they are in most public companies,&quot; Mr. Bevins says. &quot;This, in essence, turns us into a public company from the standpoint of the larger items.&quot; The company has survived its mid-life crisis, allowing Mr. Turner to get on with his.    Mr. Turner's associates say they don't know what he will do next, but on one point they are unanimous: He won't manage the company's daily affairs. A plaque on his desk reads: &quot;Either Lead, Follow or Get Out of The Way.&quot; And though out of the way at the moment, he surely won't follow.    &quot;He has had a whole series of things that would have crushed a mere mortal,&quot; Mr. Roddey says. &quot;He's laying low, but I think he'll be back. He'll be back with something bold. It could be business, it could be political, or he could start a string of racehorses.&quot;    &quot;We're all concerned for him,&quot; says Stan Kasten, Turner Broadcasting's vice president for sports teams. &quot;He's accomplished so much. I would really hope that out of all this he gets some personal happiness.&quot;    Mr. Turner will not, at any rate, be poor. He earned &quot;somewhere in the vicinity of $20 million to $25 million&quot; on the sale of the billboard company four years ago, says Peter Dames, a Turner Broadcasting director and a friend of Mr. Turner's. His 80% stake in Turner Broadcasting's common stock has a paper value of about $372.3 million, and he owns at least six properties, including an island, in four states.    Furthermore, the cable operators have agreed to vote in favor of a common-stock split, creating a new class of common with reduced voting rights, should Mr. Turner request it at the next annual meeting, probably next month. That would raise Mr. Turner's share of the company's voting stock back to 65%, and then he himself could sell shares without falling below 51% ownership. John Malone, the president of Tele-Communications Inc., the lead cable investor, has said Mr. Turner might need that flexibility to pay for a divorce settlement with his second wife, Jane (although divorce papers haven't yet been filed, according to Mrs. Turner's attorney).    Mr. Turner has long taken an interest in politics, and many who know him say he might try, at this juncture, to switch to a public career. &quot;If somehow he lost control of the company and wanted something new to conquer, he might go conquer Congress,&quot; says Jack Petrick, Turner's vice president of programming. Mr. Wussler, the executive vice president, adds, &quot;I've always kidded him that he'd make a great senator appointed by a governor for an unexpired term.&quot;    Mr. Turner could be handicapped in public life by his utter lack of tact -- although Mr. Wussler says, &quot;That's part of his charm.&quot; Still more serious could be evidence that Mr. Turner's often-stated commitment to family virtues is somewhat abstract. When he was accusing the networks of unwholesome programming some years ago, and before he was separated from Jane Turner, he was often seen consorting with Liz Wickersham, a Turner Broadcasting employee who is currently one of the anchors on a show called &quot;Showbiz Today.&quot;    Some doubt that Mr. Turner could find a conventional political role large enough to accommodate his self-esteem. Would he run for the presidency? &quot;I heard Ted answer that question once by saying, 'You mean like president of the United States? That's what, 200 million people? There are billions of people out there I want to reach. I'm a global communicator,'&quot; recalls Thomas Belford, the executive director of the Better World Society.    The society, a nonprofit group that Mr. Turner endowed with $500,000, is his current medium. It produces TV programs about nuclear proliferation, population control and the environment, and it allows Mr. Turner to attend board meetings with Jimmy Carter and Jacques Cousteau's son. It also interests Mr. Turner's former pilot and current female companion, J.J. Ebaugh, who serves as a liaison between the society and Turner Broadcasting.    Few doubt Mr. Turner's deep commitment to the society and its aims. Why else would he hunt with Fidel Castro, whom he refers to as &quot;my Commie buddy&quot;? But it is an open question whether the characteristics that enabled Mr. Turner to make his mark in business will help improve the human condition.     ---            Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
