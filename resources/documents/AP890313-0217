Gerstner Jr., the president of AmericanExpress Co., was named Monday as chairman and chief executiveofficer of RJR Nabisco Inc., the food and tobacco giant that becamethe prize in an epic takeover battle last year.   Analysts said Gerstner's immediate tasks would include addressingRJR's declining domestic tobacco market share and giving itsemployees a sense of direction in the wake of the takeover, whichheaped billions of dollars in new debt on the company.   RJR Nabisco agreed to the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyoutby the firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. following a bitter fightagainst a group led by former RJR chief executive F. Ross Johnson.   Gerstner, 47, faces a personal challenge in moving from a giantfinancial services company, where he spearheaded such innovations asthe American Express Platinum Card, to a manufacturing company.   But although Gerstner has little experience in manufacturing,analysts said, his administrative and marketing skills should easehis move into RJR Nabisco.   ``A background...in a specific industry is immaterial,'' saidLawrence Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst with Dean WitterReynolds in New York. ``What's more important is being a goodmanager.''   ``Obviously, it's a different business. But my understanding is(Gerstner) is a very marketing-driven person,'' said Marc Cohen, ananalyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York. ``Some of that istransferrable.''   Gerstner joined American Express in 1978 as president of theAmerican Express Card Division. The next year he was named presidentof the Travel Related Services Group, responsible for AmericanExpress cards, travelers checks and travel service offices.   When Travel Related Services became a subsidiary of the companyin 1982, Gerstner became its first chairman and chief executiveofficer. He became president of American Express in 1985.   During Gerstner's career at American Express, the company's cardmembership rose from 8.6 million to 30.7 million and the companyintroduced its popular Platinum charge card and American ExpressOptima credit card.   Cohen said Gerstner probably should decide quickly what changes,if any, should be made at RJR due to the buyout. The company alreadyhas indicated it would sell some lines of business to deal withantitrust concerns raised by the federal government but the extentof any further restructuring _ which could involve otherdivestitures or employee cuts _ largely is unknown.   ``I would think those moves must become clarified as soon aspossible to comfort the employees who might be involved,'' Cohensaid. ``He's got to calm the troops and give a sense of direction.That's an issue there.''   Gerstner also must develop strategies to address RJR's loss intobacco market share, Cohen said.   Cohen said RJR's market share dropped to 31.8 percent in 1988from 32.5 percent in 1987. Had RJR maintained its market share, itwould have meant almost another $125 million in revenue, he said.   But Adelman said RJR's decline did not represent a ``panic''situation.   ``He's not walking into a troubled situation,'' Adelman said.   KKR partner Henry R. Kravis, making the announcement Monday,cited Gerstner's ``distinguished record of leadership at anorganization of comparable size and quality to RJR Nabisco.''   Gerstner issued a statement saying he was ``delighted to take thehelm of a company with such a rich history as RJR Nabisco.'' Hepromised to ``work to further improve the company, grow it, and makeit a creative and exciting place to work.''   Gerstner was not immediately available for further comment.   Among RJR Nabisco's operating companies are R.J. ReynoldsTobacco, Nabisco Brands, Del Monte Foods and Planters LifeSavers.   American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III said he wouldassume the additional duties of president at American Express afterGerstner's departure.   American Express also announced that Aldo Papone, president andchief operating officer of Travel Related Services, would replaceGerstner as chief executive officer.</TEXT></DOC>
