Xerox said the pretax charge would reflect costsassociated with the employment reduction, including enhancedsalary continuance and benefit packages for some eligibleemployees, and in some cases involuntary layoffs withstandard benefit payments. The document processing businessinvolves manufacturing and servicing office products.</LP><TEXT>   Xerox said it expects to save about $150 million in 1992and $200 million annually in subsequent years by cutting thedocument processing cost base. Many of the staff cuts will bemade in the Monroe County, N.Y., area. The documentprocessing work force totals about 101,000 world-wide.   Paul A. Allaire, chairman and chief executive officer,said the reduction will help create a &quot;more efficient,flatter, customer-responsive organization. The changes willbe primarily in the overhead areas of the business consistentwith moving more of our resources into activities thatdirectly add customer value.&quot;   A Xerox spokesman said the proposed cuts don't involveXerox Financial Services, which in the last year and a halfreduced employment to 9,600 from 12,100 and which has beenselling some businesses.   He noted that the document processing work force hadincreased by 2,000 during 1991, with the additions reflectingemployees who deal directly with customers. The planned cutsinvolve layers of managers and coordinators, he said, andwill &quot;force the decision-making closer to the people who aredirectly working with customers.&quot;   Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,said, &quot;Over the last several years there has been this trendtowards a continued downsizing. This was and is going tocontinue. The surprise part of this {new announcement} wasthat they accelerated the program, mostly because onmacroeconomic conditions.&quot;   The cutback &quot;is a laudable exercise, and we would like tosee more of this,&quot; commented B. Alex Henderson, a PrudentialSecurities Inc. analyst. &quot;It's the right direction for thiscompany. It's very, very much a pinpoint type of staffreduction -- not like some other companies.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Allaire said the cutbacks &quot;reallyaccelerate a number of planned reductions we would have madeover a period of time.&quot; Asked whether any further cuts arelikely, he said &quot;I would expect to do that within normaloperations,&quot; assuming a &quot;reasonable economic environment.&quot;   He added that the write-off wasn't in reaction to &quot;anyconcern about the fourth quarter,&quot; which he said should bepretty much in line with prior expectations.</TEXT></DOC>
