Those two elements of the economic equation suddenly turned intowild cards, but the news isn't all bad.   Higher taxes, for one, could help trim the U.S. budget deficit,which many economists call the main problem. Others fear a biggertax bite will hamper economic expansion.   Higher oil prices might revive energy conservation, but it seemsdoubtful they will last. The Persian Gulf crisis also has promptedthe government to speed efforts at developing a national energypolicy.   But in the short run, the higher tax and fuel bills won't bemuch fun for anybody except perhaps the tax collectors and theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   ``Consumers have to cut back on their spending because they'respending more money on fuel and heating oil,'' said Edwin S.Rothschild, of Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group.``Businesses are having to spend more and people are being laidoff. The airlines are having a hard time.''   Rothschild estimated that before this cold season ends, theaverage household that uses home heating oil will have to paybetween $300 and $500 more to keep warm.   Consumers also were paying about 30 cents a gallon more forgasoline as the year drew to a close. Experts pointed out, however,that when inflation is taken into account, fuel prices were muchcheaper in 1990 than they were in the early 1980s, when theaftershocks of the Iranian revolution pushed oil prices higher.   Regardless, the effects of the expensive oil will ripple throughthe economy, which is already running into hard times.   ``It is a major contributing factor to the recession that we areentering,'' Rothschild said.   Although many economists and Wall Streeters were proclaiming arecession throughout the fall, the government carefully avoideduttering what has become known as the dreaded ``R-word.''   The administration's deeds spoke louder than words, however,when Bush abandoned his ``read my lips'' pledge of no new taxes.The government instituted a sweeping package of higher taxes onincome, gasoline, cigarettes and liquor.   The gasoline tax increase of 5.1 cents a gallon added to theburden of higher fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.Economists say it will hit working people and the poor hardest.   During 1990, Americans had to work full-time from Jan. 1 to May5 before they had paid off their entire tax burden, according tothe Tax Foundation, a Washington watchdog group.   It's too early to pinpoint the date of ``Tax Freedom Day'' for1991, but the foundation estimates it will be pushed back again.   ``It really can't help but make it even worse,'' Tax Foundationspokesman Bill Ahern said. ``The only thing that could prevent theday from getting worse would be a phenomenal economic recovery for1991 that doesn't seem to be in the cards. If you look at the taxes... they are substantial.''   Many economists see the tax burden as a bigger threat to thefamily budget than expensive oil, because oil is plentiful despitethe Gulf crisis.   In December, OPEC ministers agreed to reinstate productionquotas once the turmoil ends, but oil analysts predict the cartelwill have a tough time executing that plan.   The American Petroleum Institute, a leading industry tradeorganization, said if crude prices come down and stay down, theprices of refined petroleum products will have to follow.   As 1991 progresses, it could reveal whether the United Stateshas changed any of its energy priorities after suffering the oilshock of 1990.   The Energy Department is expected to release a long-awaitedenergy strategy that will include expanded uses of alternativefuels as well as proposals for drilling for oil in the ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
