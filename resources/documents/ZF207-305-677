Olivetti andamp; Co.andP;  The Italian minicomputer and PC maker has beennegotiating with Phoenix Technologies Inc., of Norwood, Mass., to purchaselarge volumes of advanced basic input output system (ABIOS) chips developedfor use in PS/2s, sources said.andM;''It would make sense for Olivetti to clone PS/2s,'' said Aaron Goldberg,vice president at International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.,andO;market-research firm.andP;  ''The PS/2 is selling very well in Europe.''andM;The new raft of MCA compatibles is already helping to boost chip-set sales.andO;At Chips andamp; Technologies, Ares said MCA chip-set sales accounted for 3 percentof the company's $54.4 million in revenue for the quarter ended Dec.andP;  30, thefirst significant sign of sales of MCA products at the company.andM;''We expect that to go higher,'' Ares said.andP;  ''We plan to put a lot of effortinto the marketing of the PS/2 products in the next two or three months.''andM;Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., which launched a new MCA chip set inNovember, said that some customers who received samples of the product two orthree months ago are now ordering it for production.andM;Similarly, PC board makers are saying that sales of MCA products have pickedup.andP;  Officials at Boca Research Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., said sales of MCAboards are up 50 percent over last summer's level.andP;  At STB Systems Inc., aRichardson, Texas, board maker, revenue from MCA products is expected toaccount for 5 percent to 10 percent of the company's $35 million in salesthis year.andM;The increasing signs of life in the MCA clone-component market raises theprospect of more clones on the domestic horizon.andP;  So far, Tandy Corp., ofFort Worth, Texas, is the only American manufacturer to send an MCA cloneinto the market, and the results have been less than encouraging.andP;  Tandy saidit has shipped primarily review units of the MCA clone to large corporatecustomers.andP;  ''I have no idea if any large orders have been placed,'' saidTandy spokeswoman Michele Ryan.andM;Dell Computer Corp., of Austin, Texas, scuttled plans to sell an MCA clonelast summer because of weak demand.andP;  Spokesman Brian Fawkes said Dellexecutives have not discussed reviving the MCA clone.andM;One problem facing Tandy, Dell and other domestic PC makers, say analysts, isthat those companies would have to undercut prices of IBM's MCA machines byapproximately 15 percent to lure customers away from Big Blue.andM;Those competitive conditions increase the likelihood that the next round ofMCA clones will come from minicomputer companies that have the manufacturingfacilities and installed customer bases to make production of such a cloneprofitable, according to Brian Dean, an STB product-marketing manager.andO;''They have large, captive markets, and they sell very well into thosemarkets,'' he said.andM;Although no minicomputer makers have officially announced MCA clones, a feware giving strong indications of doing so.andP;  A spokesman from WangLaboratories Inc., of Lowell, Mass., said last week that ''work wascontinuing'' in the Micro Channel area.andM;Unisys Corp., another minicomputer maker, also reported interest in the MicroChannel.andP;  ''It will be June before we're ready to talk,'' said spokesman EdJohnson in Blue Bell, Pa.andP;  ''We're in some negotiations right now.andP;  We'redrawing up plans.''andM;Mincomputer market-leader Digital Equipment Corp., of Maynard, Mass., haspublicly denied that it will offer an MCA clone through its OEM PC deal withTandy.andP;  A source close to Tandy, however, said DEC is expected to offerTandy's MCA clone on an OEM basis.andM;But not all minicomputer makers say they are convinced they will need an MCAcompatible in their product line.andP;  Louis Barten, assistant vice president ofproduct management at NCR Corp. in Dayton, Ohio, said neither customer nornetworking demands currently exist to warrant the introduction of an MCAclone.andM;''If there was really something special about Micro Channel being connectedto an IBM environment, why would IBM continue to introduce machines withoutMicro Channel,'' he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
