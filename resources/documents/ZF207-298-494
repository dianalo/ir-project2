(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Evan O. GrossmanandM;As The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. (SCO) began shipping the first developers'kits for its Open Desktop Unix environment recently, developers predictedthat applications taking advantage of Open Desktop's advanced features willlikely lag far behind the system software's release.andM;Due this fall, Open Desktop comprises several system- andapplications-software modules bundled together by SCO.andP;  Using SCO Unix SystemV release 3.2 as a base, Open Desktop includes Merge/386 DOS-emulationsoftware, TCP/IP software, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Network File Systemsoftware, the X Window graphics routines, Relational Technology Inc.'s INGRESStructured Query Language (SQL) database software and the Open SoftwareFoundation's OSF/Motif user interface.andM;The environment promises to provide 386-based PC users with a comprehensiveset of system software to run applications designed for high-poweredworkstations, while separating them from the complexity of the underlyingoperating system, developers said.andM;''We're coming closer and closer to giving the user a tool instead of acomputer,'' said Terry Keene, president of TRG Inc., an Atlanta value-addedreseller and distributor of Unix systems.andM;Among possible tools under Open Desktop will be Informix Software Inc.'sWingz spreadsheet, which will be able to extract data from an Informix SQLdatabase.andP;  ''The spreadsheet becomes a powerful front end for providingmultiple ways for looking at your data,'' said Doug Edwards, executivedirector of brand marketing for Wingz at the Lenexa, Kan., company.andM;SCO, by including in the base operating system such features as a databaseengine, networking software and user interface tools, is offering developersa robust platform on which to build applications, SCO officials said.andM;''The applications will be much more integrated, much easier to use for theend user,'' said Alan Ginzburg, director of strategic marketing for the SantaCruz, Calif., firm.andM;Open Desktop applications still must be written.andP;  The concept is simple, butwriting applications that take advantage of Open Desktop isn't, saiddevelopers.andM;A developer must first convert the application to take advantage ofhigh-resolution graphics instead of simple character displays.andP;  The developerthen has to separate the user interface from the software and use OpenDesktop's OSF/Motif user interface.andP;  Finally, the developer has the option ofincorporating SQL database functionality, DOS routines and networkingcapability into the application.andM;Developers said it will take several months to convert and test theirapplications.andM;While these applications are being developed, many vendors expect OpenDesktop users to run existing Unix and Xenix applications, which will be ableto run in an Open Desktop window.andM;''You will be able to run the regular Xenix binaries in what's called theXterm windows,'' said Lawrence Flon, president of Quality Software ProductsCo. (QSP), a Santa Monica, Calif., software developer.andP;  ''It's like runningDOS applications under OS/2.andP;  .  .  .  You don't get the mouse, you don't getpull-down menus.''andM;QSP expects to have Open Desktop versions of Q-Calc, its Lotus1-2-3-compatible spreadsheet, and MasterPlan, a project-management package,by the end of the year, Flon said.andM;WordPerfect Corp. also plans to migrate from a character-based interface to agraphical environment.andP;  Currently, only the character-based WordPerfect 4.2will run under Open Desktop, said Scott Worthington, director of the Unixproducts division at the Orem, Utah, developer.andM;''When we start getting into the graphical user interface on WordPerfect 5.0,it will make more sense for us to see how we can integrate with [OpenDesktop] as a whole,'' said Worthington.andP;  An Open Desktop version ofWordPerfect could take advantage of several features, including X Windowgraphics and the OSF/Motif user interface, he suggested.andM;All of these gains in graphics and ease of use will come at a price to users,however, vendors said.andM;''If you're running a 386 with Open Desktop, it eats all the resources of thesystem so that it essentially becomes a single-user workstation,'' said SteveBartle, vice president of technical services for PGI, a Phoenix, Ariz.,andO;distributor and reseller of Unix systems.andM;Although Open Desktop can support multiple users on either character-based orX Window terminals, many developers said that, depending on the amount ofgraphics processing required, multiple users could exhaust the systemresources.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
