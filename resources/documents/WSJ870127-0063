Mr. Kingon, 55 years old, has been secretary of the cabinet and has played a major role in forming domestic policy, particularly in trade and other economic areas, since 1985. He came to the White House with Chief of Staff Donald Regan, with whom he worked at the Treasury Department as assistant secretary for policy planning and communications.    If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Kingon's departure from the White House would add to the number of top vacancies. White House Communications Director Patrick Buchanan is expected to leave soon, and domestic policy adviser John Svahn already has left. The president has yet to name a new chief speech writer, and other slots on the speech-writing staff remain unfilled. The White House also is casting about for a successor for Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey, who underwent brain surgery more than a month ago.    Among those believed to be under consideration to succeed Mr. Kingon is Gary Bauer, undersecretary of education. Mr. Bauer, a close ally of Attorney General Edwin Meese III and a strong social conservative, most recently headed the department's study of the American family. </TEXT></DOC>
