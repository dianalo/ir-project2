College Ave., Indianapolis,Ind.andP;  46220, can be reached at (317) 255-6476.andM;Output options include a number of multivariate statistics, includingcanonical correlation, principal-components analysis, discriminant analysis,MANOVA, cluster analysis, orthogonal factors and covariance analysis, all ofwhich can be used with support statistics.andM;Another new program, called Axum, produces ultra-high-resolution statisticalgraphs (as many as 4,096 by 3,120 pixels) from built-in data-analysisroutines, and is enhanced with a programming language.andM;Developed by TriMetrix Inc. of Seattle, Axum features automatic curve fittingand smoothing, as well as the ability to include multiple graphs on a page,combine several plot types in a single graph, and rotating, shrinking andexpanding abilities.andP;  The program can use data sets of unlimited size, andgraphs can be exported to WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Ventura Publisher,PageMaker and other programs that accept GEM, Lotus PIC, Hewlett-PackardGraphics Language (HPGL), Tektronix and PostScript files.andM;Among Axum's advanced plotting capabilities are Smith reflection andimpedance charts, which are used in microwave engineering; polar plots, usingpolar coordinates; Lowess plots, consisting of curve fitting with a locallyweighted regression line; 3-D spline plots, which show a smooth 3-D surface;3-D regression plots; and 3-D surface plots with data fitted to a grid.andM;Stacked-Bar AbilitiesandM;Another package to gain box plots in its latest version is Powerstation, byAlphametrics Corp. of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.andP;  Stacked bars and full-screen editingare other innovations present in version 2.0, which was released last spring.andM;Minitab Inc., a software maker from State College, Pa., has incorporated 11new charts for statistical process control in the current release of itsMinitab 7.1.andP;  Users of the package can monitor and control process qualityand pinpoint problems through graphical depictions that include sample means,sample ranges and the proportion of non-conformities.andM;Another vendor, Systat Inc. of Evanston, Ill., offers several new commands inversion 1.1 of its Sygraph graphics module.andP;  New density estimators cancreate continuous histograms for one or two variables, showing the areaswhere the data points are most concentrated in the sample.andP;  Smoothing optionspermit the fine-tuning of the density estimation, and Sygraph has newcommands to produce enlarged characters and data labels with as many as 80characters.andM;Meanwhile, a newcomer to the statistical arena called Forecast Master Plus,from Business Forecasting Systems Inc. of Belmont, Mass., includes ahigh-resolution time-series graphics module with analytical options that gobeyond such standard displays as trend lines and residual values to providean error-autocorrelation function and cross-correlations.andP;  Forecast MasterPlus also offers scrollable bar charts.andM;Business Forecasting Systems has also just released ForeCalc, a newforecasting add-in for all current versions of Lotus 1-2-3, except release3.0, that provides graphics in addition to statistical analysis.andM;Survival analysis and time-series forecasting have been added to Solo 3.0, apackage from Los Angeles-based BMDP Statistical Software Inc., along withhigh-resolution graphics to chart results of the new procedures.andM;Among the graphs in this module are survival, function and probit plots.andP;  Thetime-series module offers data plots, autocorrelation, frequency and harmonicregression, and mean and median plots that note seasonal adjustments inforecast data.andM;Version 4.1 of NWA Quality Analyst, a product from Northwest Analytical Inc.,andO;generates graphs such as process-capability histograms with aprobability-curve overlay; non-normal distributions, including correction forskewed, truncated and folded distributions; Shewart control charts;cumulative sum charts; Pareto diagrams to summarize the frequency of defectsor other problems in a bar-chart format; and attribute control charts.andM;NWA, at 520 N.W.andP;  Davis St., Portland, Ore.andP;  97209, can be reached at (503)224-7727.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
