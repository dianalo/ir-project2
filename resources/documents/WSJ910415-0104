Conexion Familiar Inc., in a complaint filed in SanFrancisco Superior Court against ATandamp;T on April 2, allegedthat ATandamp;T had engaged in &quot;unfair trade practices&quot; byswitching Conexion's customers to ATandamp;T's service without thecustomers' consent -- &quot;slamming&quot; in industry parlance.</LP><TEXT>   The presiding judge issued an order temporarilyrestraining ATandamp;T from targeting Conexion customers until thelawsuit, which seeks unspecified monetary relief, can beheard. The two parties are due back in court May 9 at whichtime ATandamp;T could be hit with a preliminary injunction.   Conexion, a 10-month-old closely held startup based in SanRafael, Calif., buys transmission in bulk from U S SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.,and resells it at a discount to Spanish-speaking customers inthe San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles. Conexion saidSprint isn't backing its legal fight with ATandamp;T.   Conexion's complaint is ironic, given ATandamp;T's battle lastyear with its nemesis MCI Communications Corp. over slamming.After ATandamp;T accused MCI of stealing its customers, the tworeached an out-of-court settlement and a proposal forconsumer safeguards at the end of last year.   But slamming continues, according to Conexion PresidentRobert Emrich. &quot;At the rate we were losing customers we'dsoon be out of business if we hadn't taken action. We calledour {former} customers and most didn't even know they hadbeen switched to ATandamp;T,&quot; he said in an interview. He addedthat the loss of customers stopped &quot;like a gunshot&quot; once thetemporary restraining order was issued.   &quot;We have done nothing wrong,&quot; said an ATandamp;T spokesman. &quot;Wechecked out those customers and found that 25% of them hadactually given us written authorization to switch them.{Slamming} is totally against ATandamp;T policy.&quot;   The complaint states that as of March 8, Conexion wasproviding service to about 12,000 residential customers, buton March 12, the company was notified by Pacific Bell and GTEof California, which must process such local service changes,that 278 Conexion customers had switched to ATandamp;T's service inone day. From March 12 to the first week of April anadditional 1,000 customers had been switched, or&quot;approximately 10% to 12% of Conexion's total customer base,&quot;the complaint says.   The complaint concluded that Conexion, which claims tohave less than 1% of the U.S. market for Spanish-speakingcustomers compared with ATandamp;T's 80%, has become a victim of a&quot;massive marketing campaign&quot; by ATandamp;T to &quot;win back&quot; formercustomers. Some customers, the complaint alleged, had beencontacted via direct mail in which they were sent a check,which pays a small fee and automatically signs the customerup for ATandamp;T when the check is cashed.   ATandamp;T's spokesman said there &quot;were no ambiguities&quot; in thecheck offer, which included a flyer explaining how the signupworked and &quot;another reminder under the endorsement line whereyou sign the check.&quot; However, Barbara Snider, Conexion'sattorney, pointed out that none of the material was writtenin Spanish, which ATandamp;T's spokesman didn't dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
