Late last month, Daiwa Securities America, U.S. arm of theJapanese investment house, gathered tribal leaders, governmentofficials, Indian experts and others in New York for a daylongconference on tribal financing.   Charles Entwistle, a Daiwa senior vice president, said themeeting was designed to present financing opportunities to both thetribes and investors.   ``It looks like a good opportunity for channeling some of theJapanese money coming into the United States,'' Entwistle said.``We're satisfied that the business is there. Now it's just amatter of can we put deals together.''   The effort is prompted by an amendment to the federal IndianFinance Act signed into law last September. The amendment allowstribes to float bonds that would be backed by government guaranteesfor up to 90 percent of their value.   Such government backing would put tribal bonds on par with manybonds issued by government agencies.   Government guarantees allow the bond issuer to pay a lowerinterest rate since the buyers are assured of getting most of theirmoney back should there be a default. The lower interest rate makesthe bonds cheaper for the tribes to issue.   Daiwa is working on a major Indian funding project that wouldamount to hundreds of millions of dollars, Entwistle said, thoughhe declined to give details.   In addition to bonds, funding mechanisms for tribal projectsunder exploration by Daiwa include joint ventures, equity interestsand private placements, or debt issues that are sold privately andnot publicly traded, Entwistle said.   One bond issue the company is working on would provide about$6.5 million for the Chickasaw Nation to buy the ArbuckleWilderness, a 485-acre drive-through park and exotic wild animalpreserve in Oklahoma that is a major tourist attraction.   However, the government-guaranteed bond issue has been delayedby the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which must approve thefinancing.   The BIA and its parent, the Interior Department, have notfinished writing regulations to implement the amendment to theIndian Finance Act, said BIA spokesman Carl Shaw.   ``No one knew at the time that amendment was passed that therewould have to be new regulations written,'' Shaw said last week.   In addition, the BIA must receive funding for a reserve fund toguarantee the bond issues, Shaw said. A request for that fundingwas not submitted to Congress this year because ``we don't feellike we can request those funds'' due to budgetary constraints,Shaw said.   The soonest the reserve fund could be approved, allowinggovernment-backed tribal bonds to be issued, would be fiscal 1991,which starts October 1, 1990, assuming Congress approves thefunding by then, Shaw said.   Entwistle said he believes the BIA is creating unnecessarydelays. Nowhere in the amendment does it say that new regulationsor a new reserve fund are needed, he said, pointing out that areserve fund was created under the existing Indian Finance Act.   ``The law was written to be enacted immediately,'' he said.   Indian tribes can float bonds under the original Indian FinanceAct, which was approved in the early 1980s, but the bonds aren'tguaranteed by the government. Instead, the tribes must back theissues by natural-resource earnings or other tribal revenue.   The amended finance law provides enhanced capability for thetribes to raise money, Shaw said.   Charles Blackwell, an Indian attorney who is a consultant toDaiwa, said the BIA dispute is overshadowed by the significance ofthe Indian gathering in New York.   ``Leaders from 20-plus tribes came to Wall Street bringing theirdeals and saying `Let's do business,''' he said. ``It was the firsttime in history.   ``Congress is 100 percent behind the individual initiatives thatare taking place in Indian country,'' he added. ``And the tribesthemselves are emerging as very powerful business entities in theUnited States. The BIA will fall in line.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday, May 8</NOTE></DOC>
