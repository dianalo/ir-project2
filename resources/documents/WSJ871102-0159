Eurotunnel must complete the offering in order to draw on #5 billion of bank loans pledged last August. The consortium is scheduled in December to begin construction of a tunnel under the English Channel between Britain and France.    Mr. Morton said he isn't concerned about adverse investor reaction to the issue in the wake of the world-wide stock-market plunge and subsequent volatility. Nor is he worried, he said, about potential fallout within the investment community due to Thursday's decision by the British government to proceed with its #7.24 billion offering of British Petroleum Co. shares, which will inflict some losses on underwriters and investors due to the steep market decline since the offering price was set.    Mr. Morton said there are several differences between the BP and Eurotunnel offerings. Terms of the Eurotunnel offering have yet to be set and the size of the issue is much smaller than the BP offering, he noted. Mr. Morton said Eurotunnel's planned offering may be reduced by up to #150 million, depending on the success of efforts to sell shares privately in several countries. </TEXT></DOC>
