The change, which is effective immediately, was prompted by extensive deregulation of natural gas prices in Canada in October 1985.    The previous procedure required that Canada maintain natural gas reserves at least 15 times total annual production. The board said such regulation wasn't appropriate any longer because, by mandating an inventory of natural gas supplies, it could distort gas prices.    The government agency said market forces will be allowed to operate freely as long as they are serving Canadian natural gas needs &quot;adequately and fairly.&quot; The U.S. is Canada's only export market for natural gas.    Under its new procedure, the agency said it will consider any complaints that Canadian natural gas users can't obtain additional supplies of gas under contract with terms, conditions and prices similar to those in export proposals. If the board finds merit in a complaint, it may deny an export application.    The agency said it also will require applicants for export licenses to file an impact assessment, allowing the board to determine whether a proposed export is likely to cause Canadians difficulty in meeting their energy requirements &quot;at fair prices.&quot;    The board said the previous procedure could have resulted in &quot;greater restrictions in export volumes than are warranted by public interest.&quot; But a board official said the regulations haven't curbed exports to the U.S. because Canada has abundant gas reserves, currently about 30 times annual production.    Canadian natural gas exports to the U.S. have picked up in recent months, but shipments still amount to only about 45% of the volume licensed for export. The board official estimated that Canadian supplies were currently meeting more than 5% of U.S. demand, up from about 4.5% last year. He estimated that exports of Canadian natural gas to the U.S. this year would exceed 850 billion cubic feet, up 11% from 765 billion last year. </TEXT></DOC>
