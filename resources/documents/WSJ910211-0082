The dream is the brainchild of a local thinker, StanleyShetka. His World Art Project is as simple as it is complex-- an enormous piece of art composed of a belonging fromeveryone on Earth, gathered up and plunked down on five acresof quiet farmland. &quot;It's a multimedia sculptural environment.You'll walk in and it will react to you,&quot; he says softly. &quot;Asyou move, things will start to happen and change -- actualbuildings will begin to move.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The project reflects Mr. Shetka's vision of world unity.As he puts it: &quot;It's crossing boundaries; not looking atstates or countries, but people of the world.&quot;   Since 1988, Mr. Shetka -- a 38-year-old art professor --has traveled the world spreading both his vision andthousands of brown paper bags stamped with his address. Heasks everyday Joes and Janes to donate one belonging eachplus a dollar bill (or rough equivalent in other currencies)with &quot;World Art Project&quot; written on the border. As he spendsthe money donated to the project, the bills could also serveas circulating ads for the cause, Mr. Shetka figures.   Some individuals were unusually generous. At one gallerypublicizing the project, an elderly couple donated thebeloved prize ribbons they had won at 4-H contests. One womangave the necklace she was wearing; a little boy even removedthe shoes from his feet. &quot;The responses from people are muchmore than I expected. It's overwhelming,&quot; says Mr. Shetka.   Lately, he has been using a computer to record andcategorize the submissions. They total in the thousands, andinclude a priest's collar, wisdom teeth, a CAT scan of ababy, a roll of sod, a moped and even a live horse. &quot;I won'ttake the horse until I'm ready for it,&quot; he says. He plans tostart construction this summer, calling upon those people whohave volunteered their time to help his project.   The project is already changing the world, or at least atiny part of it.   &quot;We used to have a jail and a police station, the wholebit,&quot; says Bernard Novak, a township supervisor and automechanic. &quot;But the railroad decided to go through Lonsdale,and this town started dissolving.&quot; Now, the few hundredpeople who call the Minnesota hamlet home may find they havea world of new things on their doorstep.</TEXT></DOC>
