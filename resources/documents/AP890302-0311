The ministers from the 12-nation European Economic Communityagreed that they would try to obtain a total ban by the end of thiscentury on the production and use of chlorofluorocarbon, or CFCcompounds.   They also decided to seek an 85 percent cutback in production assoon as possible.   These compounds, practically indestructible, are found inrefrigeration fluids, foam-blowing agents, cleaning solvents and,outside North America and Scandinavia, aerosol propellants. Theyhave found wide use because they are non-toxic and do not burn.   CFCs are widely blamed for depleting the ozone, a problem whichGreenpeace, the international environmental organization, claimed is``out of control.''   The ozone layer deflects much of the sun's harmful ultravioletrays and protects human health, crops, sea life and certainindustrial materials, according to Greenpeace.   The ministers agreed to give the EEC Commission a mandate toobtain a complete phase out of the manufacture and use of CFCs bythe year 2000. The Commission will represent the 12 nations at theinternational conferences being held this year to discuss the ozoneissue and monitor application of the Montreal Protocol.   This protocol, signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32, whichtook effect Jan. 1, is aimed at reducing output and use of CFCs by50 percent from current levels by 1998.   The EEC ban would only affect CFCs covered by the MontrealProtocol.   The EEC ministers also gave a mandate to the Commission toencourage other countries to sign, and ratify the protocol.   The EEC member states are responsible for about half the world'sannual CFC production of a million tons, with Britain leading inboth production and exports. According to Greenpeace, Britainexported CFCs to 117 countries in 1988, 81 of which had not signedthe Montreal Protocol.   Greenpeace said that ``between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer overthe EEC has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent. Thisrises to nearly 7 percent in the winter.''   Scientists have warned that further depletion of the ozone layerwould warm the earth, lead to increasing desertification, melt partof the polar ice-caps, raise the sea level and flood parts oflow-lying countries.   They have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layer, whichlies in the earth's stratosphere, would increase the numbers of skincancers. According to Greenpeace ``each 1 percent depletion isestimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4percent.''   Ministers from countries which have ratified the MontrealProtocol are due to meet in London from March 5 to 7 and a furtherconference is scheduled in Helskinki, Finland, from May 2 to 5 tomonitor the application of the protocol.</TEXT></DOC>
