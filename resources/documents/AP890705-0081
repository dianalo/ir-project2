In Paris, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand appealed for an immediate cease-fireand a cutoff of arms deliveries to the former French colony. TheSoviet Union is the main arms supplier for the Iraqis and Syrians.   The newspaper An-Nahar said the Syrian blockade aims to forceChristian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun to remove Soviet-mademedium-range missiles he reportedly obtained from Iraq that couldhit the Syrian capital Damascus.   The newspaper, in an unattributed report, said Syria ``insiststhat the Frog-7 missiles be removed from Lebanon.''   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, has declared support for Aoun's``war of liberation'' against 40,000 Syrian troops in predominantlyMoslem territories of Lebanon. Rival Christian and Moslemgovernments headed by Aoun and Salim Hoss have existed sinceSeptember.   Police said land skirmishes around the Christian enclave quietedWednesday. On Tuesday, Syrian-allied Moslem forces reopened gatewayslinking the enclave in east Beirut and north of the capital with therest of Lebanon, relaxing the four-month siege of 1 millionChristians.   The police spokesman said only ``a few bursts of machine-gunfire'' were reported along Beirut's dividing Green Line and themountain range southeast of the capital.   Syrian artillery in Moslem west Beirut intermittently shelled theChristian ports of Jounieh, Amsheet and Byblos to prevent Aoun fromreceiving Iraqi-supplied war materiel. No casualties were reported.   Police said two Syrian gunboats were cruising the Mediterraneannorth of Beirut to search ships plying Christian waters.   The Syrian navy's activity covered the 28-mileChristian-controlled stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterraneancoast, a police spokesman said.   He said Aoun ``has managed to receive tanks, missiles, howitzersand a variety of other weapons and ammunition despite the dailySyrian artillery shelling of his ports.''   The spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with standingrules, said the Syrian navy ``intercepted and searched'' eightfreighters that sailed into and out of Christian ports sinceSaturday.   Aoun on Tuesday summoned ambassadors of the five permanent memberstates of the U.N. Security Council and expressed concern over theSyrian naval blockade of the 310-square-mile enclave.   The 54-year-old Maronite general also sent messages to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Arab LeagueSecretary-General Chedli Klibi complaining that Syrian navy vesselswere ``intercepting commercial ships in Lebanese territorialwaters.''   An-Nahar said Syria has informed a three-member Arab committeeeon Lebanon of its demand about removing the missiles from theChristian enclave.   Iraq was reported to have delivered six Soviet-designed Frog-7missiles to the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militiaalliance. But Aoun has repeatedly denied receiving such weapons.   The Frog-7, which has a range of 43 miles and carries a warheadof 1,210 pounds of high explosives, is capable of hitting the Syriancapital of Damascus if fired from the Christian heartland.   The leftist daily As-Safir said in an editorial: ``The missilecrisis threatens grave repercussions, not just in Lebanon, but inthe entire region.''   Beirut airport, closed since March 12, was scheduled to reopenTuesday. But Aoun threatened to shell the airport, in Syrian-policedwest Beirut, in retaliation for the Syrian naval blockade.   ``Aoun informed the Moslem side that the airport will be allowedto operate only when the Syrians lift their naval blockade,'' thepolice spokesman said. He did not elaborate.   The present confrontation broke out March 8, two days after Aounblockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south ofBeirut that he said were depriving the government of $100 million incustoms dues annually.   The Syrians retaliated by besieging the Christian enclave.   In a joint statement after two days of talks, Gorbachev andMitterrand called for an immediate cease-fire and supported ArabLeague mediation. They said their countries are available to helpwith other efforts ``notably in the framework of the United NationsSecurity Council.''   The statement said Gorbachev and Mitterrand ``are convinced thatLebanon must remain a sovereign, independent, united, with itsterritorial integrity respected.''</TEXT></DOC>
