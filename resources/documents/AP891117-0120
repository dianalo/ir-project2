Thursday's storms came from the system that spun off tornadoesin eight states in the South and Midwest on Wednesday. The two-daytoll: at least 29 dead and hundreds injured, including 17 dead and1,000 homeless in Huntsville, Ala., and a death in Canada.   President Bush today issued a disaster declaration for tornadovictims in Huntsville, making the city eligible for federal reliefprograms, said Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott.   Hunt said he believed damage exceeded $100 million, althoughteams assessing the destruction were not expected to come up with afigure until later.   Authorities and witnesses in Newburgh, N.Y., about 60 milesnorth of New York City, said it appeared a tornado was responsiblefor the death and destruction at East Coldenham Elementary School.   Roland Loffredo, meteorologist in charge of the National WeatherService's Albany office, examined the damage this morning and saidit and the eyewitness acounts led him to believe a strong tornadocaused the disaster.   The brick, cinder block and glass wall, about 30 feet high and50 feet wide, caved in on as many as 125 first-, second- andthird-graders as they were eating lunch, said Town of NewburghPolice Chief John Kulisek.   The wall was last inspected in 1984 and rotting wood wasdiscovered around some windows, said Valley Central SchoolSuperintendent James Coonan.   ``As part of our ongoing renovation, the defective wood wasreplaced five years ago,'' he said. Afterward, he said, ``it was asstrong as it could be.''   Besides the seven killed, 18 children were injured, threecritically. All the victims were 6 to 9 years old.   Town of Newburgh police Lt. John J. Mahoney said he arrived 10minutes after the wall collapsed to find children calling out fromunder the rubble.   ``Some were screaming, some were lying there very quiet,''Mahoney said. ``You could hear them under the debris calling forhelp, calling `Take me home, take me home.'''   District schools were closed today, and school officials wereassembling counselors to help pupils when classes resume Monday.   Kulisek said an investigation would begin today into why thewall collapsed.   A tornado knocked over trees and ripped roofs off houses in WestVirginia's Eastern Panhandle, the National Weather Serviceconfirmed. Storms also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blewwindows out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house inPiscataway, N.J., and overturned cars and blew the roof off ashopping mall in Quebec.   The weather service also confirmed a second tornado Thursday, inMontgomery County in southeastern Pennsylvania. It ripped the roofoff a building housing federal offices in King of Prussia, causingfour minor injuries.   A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in highwinds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. ANew York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown offa water tower. A Camden, N.J., man died when winds picked him upand smashed him to the ground, authorities said.   Quebec provincial police suspected a tornado was responsible forwidespread damage in St. Hilaire, a small community southeast ofMontreal.   Winds of more than 124 mph blew the roof off a shopping mall,overturned cars, shattered windows, knocked down trees and hurledmailboxes hundreds of yards in the center of St. Hilaire, a townofficial said.   In Richmond, just east of St. Hilaire, a man was killed when hiscar was hit by a school bus during the high winds, Quebecprovincial police official Bertrand Fortin said.   The storm system, churning around a collision of record warm airand extremely cold air, also was blamed for one death Wednesday inAlorton, Ill. Gov. James R. Thompson said Thursday he would seekfederal disaster aid for the southern Illinois town.   In Huntsville, the tornado covered between eight and 10 mileswith wind speeds as high as 250 mph. ``It's like taking six to 10city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it onliquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.   Winds of up to 100 mph blew out windows in Philadelphiaskyscrapers and tore a hole in the roof of the l atPhiladelphia International Airport.   Winds brought down power lines and damaged generating stations,leaving at least 180,000 customers temporarily without electricityin PennsylvaOverseas Terminania, New York and eastern Connecticut, utilityofficials said.</TEXT></DOC>
