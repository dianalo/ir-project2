Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., and others say the Commerce Departmentshould oversee shipments of goods with both military and civilianuses, as long as the goods are not being sold to the Soviet Union,China or other Communist-ruled countries.   ``I think it makes sense,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., whoheads the subcommittee on international trade in the House ForeignAffairs Committee. ``I can't commit myself now, but I`ll be glad tolook at a proposal.''   Supporters of the Commerce Department on the issue include Sens.John Heinz, R-Pa., and Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., and Rep. DougBereuter, R-Neb.   Members interested in changing the trade rules worry that theDefense Department is overzealous in blocking exports. They see U.S.business losing sales to foreign competitors when more sales areneeded to reduce the trade deficit. At the current rate, the tradedeficit will be $111 billion this year.   The Defense Department, however, has told the General AccountingOffice its work on export licenses has ``resulted in denial oflicense application to known diverters in Pacific Basin countries,at an estimated value of approximately $200 million.''   Sensitive goods shipped to allies have sometimes reached Soviethands. The Japanese government found that Toshiba Machine Co. hadsold the Soviets sophisticated machinery capable of silencingsubmarine propellers. At one point, some members of Congress showedtheir anger by destroying a Toshiba radio with hammers on theCapitol lawn.   When Congress returns from vacation next month, AuCoin and otheradvocates of the change will sound out opinion in both Houses.AuCoin represents a district where there are many high-technologycompanies.   The new effort in Congress would not keep the Pentagon out ofdecisions on exports that go directly to communist-ruled countries,or on exports of purely military goods.   The countries on which the Pentagon would continue to have itssay include Cuba, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, EastGermany, Romania, Alania, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos andCambodia.   The House voted last year to let the Commerce Department overseeexports to non-communist countries of technology with non-militaryuses, but the Senate would not go along.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher won a decision from PresidentBush against the Pentagon last month on a similar issue, enablingAmerican manufacturers to ship higher-powered computers to theSoviet Union as well as to other countries _ despite publicopposition from Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.   ``We did have a difference inside the administration on thisquestion,'' Bush told reporters at the time. ``This will notendanger the legitimate national security needs of this country.''</TEXT></DOC>
