Palco, a unit of Los Angeles-based Maxxam Group Inc., agreed to sell five major operating companies that make and market metal-cutting and welding equipment for a broad range of industries, including defense, aerospace, automotive, energy and construction.    Maxxam, a real estate and investment concern whose chairman is Charles E. Hurwitz, holds Palco through its Houston-based MXM Holdings Corp. unit.    Thomas O. Hicks, managing general partner of Hicks andamp; Haas, a Dallas-based investor group, said the acquisition is structured as a leveraged buy-out, in which a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    The Palco operations, which produced about $200 million in revenue last year, include Victor Equipment Co., Denton, Texas, and Victor's Wingaersheek division, Danvers, Mass.; Thermal Dynamics Corp., West Lebanon, N.H.; Tweco Products Inc., Wichita, Kan.; and Coyne Cylinder Co., Huntsville, Ala.    Financing for the transaction includes about $160 million in long-term debt by a group of banks led by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., New York; a bridge loan by Donaldson Lufkin, New York investment bankers; and equity investments by Hicks andamp; Haas and Donaldson, Mr. Hicks said.    He also said that James N. Mills, a St. Louis investor and partner with Hicks andamp; Haas, will serve as chairman, president and chief executive officer of Palco after the acquisition is completed, probably early next month.    Howard Bressler, Maxxam vice president and general counsel, said last night that the company hadn't any comment beyond the Hicks andamp; Haas statement but that it would make a formal announcement this morning.    Mr. Hicks and his partner, Robert B. Haas, came to prominence last year when they and Donaldson purchased Seven-Up Co. Hicks andamp; Haas's first foray into industrial manufacturing also occurred last year when it and Mr. Mills bought Clarke Industries Inc., a maker of floor cleaning equipment. Mr. Mills is chairman and chief executive of Clarke.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Maxxam closed at $12.375 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
