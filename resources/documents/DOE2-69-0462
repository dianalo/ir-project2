Whenthere is a correlation between kinematic and magnetic forcing, an instabilitymay arise in which the velocity field and magnetic field are coupled,giving large-scale growing waves. In the nonlinear dynamo problem, wherethere is no magnetic forcing, it is shown how the alpha tensor dependson both the fluid helicity and the magnetic helicity. 17 references.</TEXT></DOC>
