According to theStockholm newspaper Expressen, a scheduled Oct. 20 concert byRay Charles has been canceled because Mr. Charles is on aUnited Nations blacklist. The singer's sin: He once performedin a South African homeland. The African National Congress,when not engaged in bloody back-alley warfare with rivalgroups in South Africa, obviously feels qualified to judgethat a blues singer is not morally fit to be heard by hisSwedish fans.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
