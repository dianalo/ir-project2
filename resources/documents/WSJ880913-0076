If these choices sound baffling to you, you're not alone. The summer of 1988 is winding up as one of the most confusing periods in the history of the personal-computer market. It has left some of the industry's biggest players looking like competitors in a game of Twister, bent into pretzels from staking out mismatched pieces of the market.    The confusion for computer users faced with conflicting signals on the future of PC standards has also raised fears of a temporary dip in the PC market growth rate.    &quot;The customer is asking, 'What is it you want me to do? Point me in one direction before you push,'&quot; says Richard Shaffer, publisher of the Computer Letter.    Among the PC makers, International Business Machines Corp. may be the most twisted pretzel of all. It has spent the last 16 months proclaiming that the future of PCs lies in a conduit for data called the Micro Channel. A lot of users were still trying to figure out just what difference IBM's Micro Channel makes when rumors began circulating last month about a personal computer coming from Big Blue that won't have the vaunted Micro Channel.    IBM has also been trumpeting another new way to stay on the cutting edge of PC technology: Take out the old software at the heart of your machines (DOS) and replace it with a new program (OS/2 -- not to be confused with PS/2, the name of IBM's new line of personal computers). Users were pondering this advice this summer when IBM unveiled a slick new version of DOS that gussies up the old software to look a little more like OS/2.    Then there's the muddle over clones. When IBM brought out the PS/2 last year, it was widely expected that a gaggle of imitations would follow after six months or so. This spring just two companies -- Tandy Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. -- introduced PS/2 clones. Like parents of a new baby anxious not to upset their older child, they both declared that their PS/2 look-alikes were great products, but not so great that their clones of the old IBM PC line wouldn't still be big sellers.    Tandy has been quietly selling its PS/2 clone to corporate customers but is keeping the machine out of its big Radio Shack chain of stores. Dell now says it's going to delay shipping its PS/2 clone because the market isn't ready yet.    Now the computer-market waters are about to get a lot muddier. Today, nine IBM-clone companies are getting together in New York to make an unprecedented attack on IBM's efforts to set PC standards. The gang of nine -- including Compaq Computer Corp., Tandy and Zenith Electronics Corp. -- together have a much bigger share of the world PC market than IBM.    They will propose a new conduit to carry data from one part of a PC to another (a bus, in PC parlance). Not the Micro Channel and not the AT-bus (the design inside IBM's old PC and its clones).    The fuss over buses makes a difference, PC makers say, because the different designs can influence how quickly and efficiently PCs work. Moreover, PC add-on boards, used increasingly to add speed and functions, have to fit whatever bus is inside a machine.    IBM will also be making news today (just a crosstown bus away from the gang of nine) when it unveils the latest addition to its PS/2 line. It's widely expected to be the non-Micro Channel machine that has stirred speculation this summer.    The bus wars are taking place on a separate front from the debate over operating systems -- the software that controls a PC's inner workings. That issue -- whether to ditch DOS and buy OS/2 -- got murkier this summer, too, when an important PC program -- a new version of Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3 spreadsheet -- became bogged down by delays.    Moreover, last month a federal judge in San Jose, Calif., put off until next year the trial date for an important lawsuit that could indirectly threaten OS/2. In the suit, Apple Computer Inc. charged Microsoft Corp., OS/2's co-author, with illegally copying features of Apple's Macintosh machine. The suit covers a program called Windows, but as it happens, some of the same disputed features also appear in a coming deluxe version of OS/2.    To an extent, all this disarray has been business as usual in the PC game. &quot;There's confusion, but confusion in rapidly changing technology is not abnormal,&quot; says John Behrman, an officer of the Houston Area League of PC Users.    But right now there's a strong sense that the disarray is worse than usual. Asked about reports of the new non-Micro Channel PS/2, Chicago PC retailer Carlos Frum replies, &quot;If this is true, then we are more confused than anyone else, and certainly our customers are confused, too.&quot;    And, says James Weil, an analyst at Gartner Securities Corp., &quot;Tuesday's announcements are going to throw more doubt and skepticism into the marketplace.&quot; He figures PC sales rose 30% to 35% in the 12 months through June 30 and had been predicting the growth rate would ease to the 25%-30% range in the 12 months ending next June. Now, he says, &quot;I'd have to say it's shifting more towards the lower end of that range because of what I think will be the message sent through these announcements.&quot;    That message, Mr. Weil says, will be: &quot;Buy only what you need to get by. Don't go out and make huge strategic investments, because it's clear the rules of the game are going to change over the next 18 months.&quot;    Somewhat insulated from the fallout is Apple Computer, which marches to its own drummer. In the past that strategy has made businesses nervous about buying Apple's maverick machines. But now Apple can point to the scuffling going on in the IBM world as a reason to opt for the more stable Macintosh line.    &quot;We certainly feel that what customers can get with the Mac is a lot simpler to understand and to choose and to use than trying to understand the complexity of a lot of other computers,&quot; says Randall Battat, Apple's product-marketing vice president.    As might be expected, industry executives are taking pains to minimize the appearance of chaos with all the factors buyers must consider in choosing PCs. &quot;I wouldn't use the word 'confused,'&quot; says Richard Gough, a top PS/2 marketing manager at IBM. &quot;What we are offering is a rich selection of choices.&quot;    ---           A Growing Market -- and Who Controls It            Leaders in PC market share in 1987        (Percentage of world-wide dollar shipments)    Compaq                                   6.5%    Apple                                    9.3%    IBM                                     23.0%    Others                                  61.2%   Source: International Data Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
