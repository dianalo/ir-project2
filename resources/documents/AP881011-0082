Both men were heading today for the West Coast and Thursdaynight's debate, with new polls indicating Bush's lead had shrunk tonext to nothing.   Before leaving, Dukakis also renewed his counterattack againstBush's repeated charges in connection with Massachusetts' formerprisoner-furlough program, under which an inmate failed to returnfrom a weekend furlough and attacked a Maryland couple severalmonths later.   Dukakis, on NBC's ``Today'' program, noted that inmates havecommitted murders while on furlough under a California programbegun while President Reagan was governor and after escaping from aHouston halfway house Bush helped start.   ``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes,that's kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics,'' Dukakis saidof Bush's recent remarks and television ads.   Later, in Medford, Mass., Dukakis pushed for improved scienceand technology education and training as the way to restore U.S.dominance in manufacturing and marketing of high-tech consumergoods.   ``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compactdiscs to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms tothe ayatollah,'' Dukakis said.   Bush, however, in remarks prepared for delivery to SeattleUniversity Business School students, said Dukakis is ``stokingfears about foreign influence,'' an apparent reference to Dukakis'recent comments on foreign investment in the United States.   ``My opponent needs an issue and he's willing to scare people tofind it, so like the `Know Nothing Party' a century before him he'sturned to fear of foreigners. He's not a Know Nothing _ he knowsbetter. But perhaps he's a feel nothing candidate, or maybe, withthis later flipflop, he's become a believe nothing candidate,''Bush said.   ``I don't think he really believes it. He ran against thisso-called economic nationalism in the primaries,'' Bush said inremarks released before he left Washington, D.C.   One day earlier, Bush, hammering at his preferred topic _ crime_ accused his rival of being more concerned about the fate ofcriminals than their victims and vowed a different approach ifelected.   ``I'm going to bring an attitude to the White House that hasmore sympathy for the victims of crime than for the criminals,''Bush told an audience Monday at a Knights of Columbus hall inTrenton, N.J.   While the vice president courted votes in Trenton'sItalian-American neighborhood, Dukakis traveled to a communitybuilt on the premise that affordable housing should be available topost-World War II families.   The Democratic nominee used a visit to a typical family inLevittown, N.Y., and a speech at the local high school to introducehis plan that would allow first-time buyers to use up to $10,000 oftheir IRAs or pension plans for a down payment.   Dukakis was meeting with Vietnam War veterans today inCambridge, Mass., and delivering an economics speech at TuftsUniversity in nearby Medford. Democratic vice presidential nomineeLloyd Bentsen was campaigning in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, twokey electoral states with 16 and 25 votes, respectively.   Bush was heading to Seattle where he was giving anothertough-on-crime speech _ white-collar, that is _ to businessstudents at Seattle University.   With the presidential debate on Thursday, barring a rainout inthe National League baseball playoff series, the two candidateswere flying to California to prepare for their 90-minute,prime-time confrontation.   The nationally broadcast debate will begin at 9 p.m. EDT in thePauley Pavilion on the University of California at Los Angelescampus.   With Election Day exactly four weeks away, the latest nationwidepoll showed the presidential race too close to call.   Bush leads Dukakis 50-47 percent in the ABC News-Washington Postpoll conducted Wednesday through Sunday. The survey of 600 likelyvoters had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentagepoints, statistically negating the lead.   A Los Angeles Times poll released Monday found that Republicanvice presidential candidate Dan Quayle remains a drag on the GOPticket. Bush-Quayle leads Dukakis-Bentsen 44-41 percent, but Bushalone leads his Democratic opponent 48-39 percent.   The weekend survey of 893 registered voters had a margin oferror of five percentage points.   But the poll also found that Dukakis' negative rating was higherthan Quayle _ 45 percent to 40 percent.   Quayle, who campaigned in Michigan and Ohio, gave what hedescribed as the ``final word'' on his answer to last week's debatequestion of what he would do if he was suddenly propelled into thepresidency.   Quayle said he would make a request to address the nation andwould consult with allies, but other steps would depend on thesituation.   ``Obviously you do different things under an assassination. Thefirst thing you do in an assassination _ I would still say a prayerfor myself and the nation _ but the first thing you do is you geton the phone and call the head of the CIA and see what he thinks itwas,'' Quayle said during a question-and-answer session after aneconomics speech in Detroit.   Quayle said he would have ``contingency plans under differentsituations.''   The GOP candidate was concentrating on voters in Ohio today witha day-long bus trip through small towns in the western part of thestate.</TEXT></DOC>
