The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisionsof the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.601-674), and the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part 900), at MiddleburgHeights, Ohio, on November 1, 1988. Notice of such hearing was issued onOctober 13, 1988 and published October 18, 1988 (53 FR 40733).Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing and the recordthereof, the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, on April 13,1989, filed with the Hearing Clerk, United States Department of Agriculture,his recommended decision containing notice of the opportunity to file writtenexceptions thereto.The material issues, findings and conclusions, rulings, and general findingsof the recommended decision are hereby approved and adopted and are setforth in full herein, subject to the following modification:Under the heading ``1. Classification of buttermilk products for use inbiscuit and pancake mixes.'', six new paragraphs are added after paragraph10.The material issues on the record of the hearing relate to:1. Classification of buttermilk products for use in biscuit and pancakemixes.2. Classification of milk dumped by handlers.3. Classification of lowfat eggnog.4. Temporary increase of pool supply plant delivery requirement to pooldistributing plants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions</ITAG>The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are basedon evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof:1. <T3>Classification of buttermilk biscuit and pancake mixes. </T3>Underthe Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order, a Class III classificationshould apply to skim milk and butterfat used to produce buttermilk biscuitand pancake mixes. At the present time, these products are not designatedin the classification provisions of the order, and milk used in the productsis therefore considered Class I. However, a product identified as buttermilkthat is packaged and sold to restaurants for use in making biscuits shouldretain its Class I classification.Sani-Dairy and Oberlin Farms Dairy, Inc., proposed that buttermilk biscuitmix be given a Class III classification. The witness testifying in supportof the proposal also recommended that the classification of milk used inbuttermilk pancake mix also be changed to Class III, as that product issimilar to buttermilk biscuit mix. The witness for the two handlers testifiedthat buttermilk biscuit mix is not a retail product, but is sold to fastfood restaurants, bakeries, and other restaurants for use in baking biscuits.He stated that the product is labeled ``Buttermilk biscuit mix (for furthermanufacturing)'', and contains added stabilizer, salt and biscuit flour.The witness stated that the added salt changes the taste of buttermilkand the flour changes the color, making the buttermilk biscuit mix unpalatablefor drinking.The witness testified that Sani-Dairy is located in Pennsylvania outsidethe Order 36 marketing area with more than 15 percent of its receipts soldas route disposition inside the marketing area as is required for poolstatus. Because of the dairy's location in western Pennsylvania, it competeswith other Pennsylvania handlers for sales of the buttermilk biscuit mixitem to fast food restaurants. Many of these Pennsylvania handlers areregulated by the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Board (PMMB), which classifiesmilk used in buttermilk biscuit mix as Class II. Because PMMB milk regulationhas only two classes, the Class II price under the PMMB is equivalent tothe Order 36 Class III price. Sani-Dairy, then, finds itself at a competitivedisadvantage because of the order's Class I classification of milk usedin buttermilk biscuit mix.Changing the classification of milk used to make buttermilk biscuit mixto Class III was opposed by Milk Marketing, Inc. (MMI), a cooperative associationrepresenting a large number of producers pooled under the order. An MMIwitness testified that while the product is not designed to be consumedas a beverage in fluid form as Class I products are, it is not storable,market-clearing or national in distribution as Class III products shouldbe. The MMI witness recommended that buttermilk biscuit mix be classifiedin Class II, and supported the recommendation by citing the ``Uniform ClassificationDecision'' which established uniform classification throughout the majorityof Federal milk order markets. The witness also observed, however, thatthe product is currently classified in Class III in the adjoining OhioValley order.Since buttermilk biscuit mix, as formulated and packaged by proponents,is not intended to be distributed for use as a beverage and because therecord shows that its basic composition is that of a nonfluid milk product,it is appropriate to classify the product in a lower-priced class. Likewise,buttermilk pancake mix should be treated similarly, as it appears to bea closely-related product. Changing the classification of buttermilk biscuitmix will place Order 36 handlers on a comparable basis with handlers regulatedby the nearby Federal Orders 33 and 40, and with handlers regulated byPMMB. Including buttermilk pancake mix as a Class III use will place Order36 handlers on a comparable basis with Order 40 and PMMB-regulated handlers.In Order 33, pancake mix is classified as Class II. Due to the small differencebetween the Class II and Class III prices and the minor volume of milkused in pancake mixes, it is not expected that the product's differingclassification in Orders 33 and 36 will cause handlers to gain any materialcompetitive advantage.Taylor Milk Company proposed that the classification of buttermilk biscuitmixes, buttermilk and buttermilk blends sold for use in on-premises bakingat a retail business should be changd from Class I to Class II. A representativeof Taylor Milk Company testified that during the past five years, the buttermilkmarket has broadened from sales for fluid consumption only to sales toa number of fast food restaurants which use the buttermilk solely for makingbiscuits. The witness stated that the buttermilk product sold by TaylorMilk Company to a fast food restaurant chain contains no modified foodstarch, but instead contains 1 percent nonfat dry milk to add body andtexture to the product. According to the witness, Taylor Milk Company'sprincipal competitor for this account is an Order 1 (New England)-regulatedhandler that adds modified food starch to its buttermilk. The witness expressedconcern that the fast food restaurant might buy all of its buttermilk forbiscuits from the Order 1 handler, and shift its purchases of other milkproducts to that handler as well. He stated that the effect of such a resultwould be to shift sales of producer milk out of the marketing area, causinga surplus of milk that would be classified as Class III, and thereby reducingprices paid to producers.The Taylor Milk Company representative described three categories of buttermilkthat should be classified as Class II. He defined buttermilk biscuit mixesas including flour and other ingredients that would be sold in a form thatcould be poured in a pan and baked. Class II Buttermilk would be buttermilkthat is sold to a restaurant for use in making biscuits, and buttermilkblend was described as containing added nonmilk solids.Taylor Milk Company's proposal to include buttermilk sold to a retail businessfor use in baking was opposed by witnesses representing Dean Foods andMMI. The Dean Foods representative stated that the proposed change wouldresult in differences in classification between Order 36 and Orders 33and 40, and thereby cause competitive disruptions between the marketingareas. The witness also maintained that buttermilk not adulterated withnonmilk ingredients is not distinguishable from a fluid milk beverage.The MMI witness testified that buttermilk is a consumable fluid beverageand should be classified as Class I. There is not indication in the hearing record that the buttermilk biscuitmix described by the Taylor Milk Company witness is produced by any milkhandler in the Order 36 marketing area, or indeed by any milk handler anywhere.The product described by the witness as ``buttermilk blend'' is the buttermilkbiscuit mix discussed earlier in this decision that is to be included inClass III. Buttermilk sold to a restaurant for use in biscuits is not changedsolely by virtue of its intended end use, and should retain Class I classification.The addition of nonfat milk solids, rather than nonmilk solids, servesonly to make the product a fortified buttermilk. The order should not differentiatebetween customer uses of fluid milk products. Buttermilk and other fluidmilk products are often used in home baking as well as restaurant baking.It would be difficult administratively to attempt to establish price differencebetween similar products used differently by customers.As noted earlier, prices to producers are not expected to be affected materiallyby changing the classification of buttermilk biscuit and pancake mixesto Class III rather than to Class II. The price difference between thetwo classes averages only about 10 cents per hundredweight, or less than1 percent of the order's uniform price to producers, and the volume ofmilk involved is not substantial.Exceptions filed on behalf of MMI took issue with the change in classificationof buttermilk biscuit mix from Class I to Class III. The cooperative agreedthat the product should not be considered a fluid milk product, but thatit should be classified as Class II, rather than as Class III. In the cooperative'sexceptions to the recommended decision, it was stated that the record containedno evidence of competitive disadvantage or disruptive marketing conditions,that even a potential competitive advantage on the part of PMMB handlersis non-existent, that the decision would result in a potential inter-ordercompetitive disadvantage for Order 36 handlers with Order 4 handlers, andthat the small price difference between Class II and III doesn't make ClassIII classification of buttermilk biscuit mix necessary under Order 36 inorder for Order 36 handlers to be competitive with handlers regulated underOrders 33 and 40.Contrary to MMI's assertion that the record contains no reference to aspecific handler offering buttermilk biscuit mix at a lower price, or ofany specific competitive advantage to another handler, the Taylor MilkCompany representative testified at length about Taylor's competition withthe H.P. Hood Company for sales to McDonald's fast food restaurants. Thewitness made it clear that the Hold Company does have distribution of someproducts into the Order 36 marketing area, and is subject to a significantlylower cost than is Taylor Milk Company for raw milk used in the productionof buttermilk biscuit mix. The Taylor witness also explained that lossof the McDonald's buttermilk biscuit mix business would likely includethe loss of contracts for the sale of ice milk and milk shake mix to McDonald's.MMI further argued that the recommended decision is incorrect in its descriptionof the Pennsylvania Milk Marketing Board (PMMB) regulation to which westernPennsylvania handlers are subject. The cooperative states the PMMB has3 classes, rather than 2 as stated in the recommended decision, and thatthe PMMB Class II price is equivalent to the Federal order Class II price,rather than the Federal order Class III price. The description of PMMBclassification and pricing contained in the recommended decision is supportedby the hearing record. If MMI representatives were aware of informationcontrary to that given in testimony at the hearing, they had ample opportunityto testify and clarify the record. The record of the public hearing isthe only basis upon which a decision on the issues involved may be made.The cooperative argued that handlers regulated under Order 4, the closestFederal order marketing area to the east of the Order 36 marketing area,would be competitively disadvantaged because buttermilk biscuit mix isconsidered a Class I product under Order 4. Although buttermilk biscuitmix may be classified as Class I under Order 4, it is classified as ClassIII in Orders 33 and 40, both of which are located closer to Order 36 thanis Order 4. Therefore, handlers regulated under these orders might be expectedto offer greater competition to Order 36-regulated handlers than handlersregulated under Order 4. MMI also pointed out that none of the classificationchanges proposed for the three northeast Federal orders (Orders 1, 2 and4) and considered at a public hearing held during June, July and Novemberof 1988 would classify milk used to make buttermilk biscuit mix as ClassIII. No decision about classification in that multiple-market proceedinghas been released. In any case, a decision in this current proceeding cannotbe based upon potential changes in other Federal order markets.The MMI exceptions observed that the reasons given in the recommended decisionfor classifying buttermilk pancake mix differently in Order 36 that inadjoining Order 33_the small difference between the Class II and ClassIII prices and the minor volume of milk used in pancake mixes_could alsobe used to classify buttermilk biscuit mixes differently in Order 36 thanin Orders 33 and 40. However, the hearing record indicates that pancakemixes account for only a fraction of the sales that biscuit mixes do, andthat handlers find the market for pancake mixes much less competitive thanthat for biscuit mixes. In fact, both of the handler representatives whotestified in support of reducing the classification of milk used in buttermilkbiscuit mix because of competitive concerns stated that their organizationsdo not market pancake mixes.For the reasons discussed above MMI's exceptions to the recommended decisiondo not provide a sufficient basis for a change from that decision. 2. <T3>Classification of milk dumped by handlers.</T3> Milk dumped or disposedof as livestock feed should be allowed to be classified as Class III usewithout prior approval by the market administrator when adequate recordsare available to support such use. Handlers must notify the market administratoron the next business day after such disposition.Three proprietary handlers proposed that milk dumped, spilled or disposedof as livestock feed be classified as Class III without prior notificationof, and approval by, the market administrator. The proponents' witnessexplained that under the current provisions of the order, a vat of milkintended for use in cottage cheese or cultured buttermilk that does not``set up'' or culture may be dumped as Class III milk only after the marketadministrator has been notified of such a necessity, and approved it. Accordingto the witness, the manufacturing process is delayed and its costs areincreased when handlers must retain the milk in vats until approval isobtained. Also, he stated that such occurrences do not always occur duringthe market administrator's normal business hours when market administratorpersonnel are readily available to grant such approval. The witness testifiedthat manufacturing records maintained by handlers are an adequate basisfor substantiating such use, which could be verified at a later time duringnormal auditing procedures. There was no opposition to adoption of theproposal from industry representatives attending the hearing.Under cross examination about inclusion of the word ``spilled'' in proponents'proposal, proponents' witness stated that the language of the proposedprovision was identical to that contained in Order 33. However, if theneed for conformity of order provisions between milk orders were a constraint,Order 33 would have to be amended to require prior approval of Class IIIuse of dumped milk since all other orders currently require such priornotification and approval. Other orders do not require prior approval forthe disposition of milk as animal feed and none allow spilled milk to bereported as a Class III use. Since Order 36 does not now require the marketadministrator's prior approval of milk disposed of as livestock feed asa Class III use, that current provision of the order requires no change.Also, milk spilled through carelessness or sloppiness should continue tobe included in a handler's shrinkage, as it is under the present orderprovisions. If an excessive percentage of receipts is spilled or lost inthe plant's operations, any amount exceeding the order's Class III shrinkageallowance is classified as Class I use. This provision is designed to assurethat handlers have an incentive to make careful use of the milk they receive,so that producers do not have to bear the cost of handler carelessnessthrough reduced uniform prices. Therefore, the word ``spilled'' shouldbe omitted from the amended order language.According to the hearing record, allowing milk dumped by a handler withoutprior notification of the market administrator to be classified as a ClassIII use would enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of handlers' manufacturingoperations. Furthermore, adequate records of such use would assure thata handler's latitude in dumping milk found to be unfit for its intendedpurposes would not be abused. In order to have dumped milk classified asa Class III use, handlers should be required to notify the market administratorof such use at their earliest opportunity during normal business hours.3. <T3>Classification of lowfat eggnog.</T3> A proposal by Superior Dairy,a proprietary distributing plant operator, to change the classificationof lowfat eggnog from Class I to Class II should not be adopted. Althoughthe proposal as included in the hearing notice would have changed the product'sclassification to Class III, the Superior Dairy witness modified the proposedclassification to Class II at the hearing. According to the witness, SuperiorDairy currently produces a product called ``holiday nog'' from non-dairyingredients, but would like to sell a lowfat eggnog made from fresh milkif the raw product cost of the beverage could be reduced. The witness estimatedthe difference in price of such a product between Class I and Class IIclassification to be 3-4 cents per quart. He stated that as a result ofthe proposed re-classification, producers would benefit from the expandedoutlet for dairy ingredients; dairy processors would be able to manufacturea better-tasting and more wholesome product than those now made of imitationingredients; and consumers would benefit from the availability of a lower-fatproduct at a competitive price. The witness testified that lowfat eggnogshould be any eggnog product containing less than 3.5 percent butterfat.He characterized lowfat eggnog as differing from chocolate drink by thetype of flavoring used and the seasonal nature of the product.Adoption of the proposal was opposed by MMI and a representative of DeanFoods. The MMI witness testified that fluid milk products are those consumedin fluid form as beverages, and stated that lowfat eggnog falls withinthat definition. He pointed out that the product has about the same shelflife as other fluid milk products, and that the season of greatest demandfor the product is the months of October through December when the milksupply is at its lowest level. The witness further testified that reclassifyinglowfat eggnog to a lower class would create competitive disadvantages forhandlers in neighboring orders who produce the product.The Dean Foods representative also opposed changing the classificationof lowfat eggnog on the basis of inter-market competition, testifying thatDean Foods bottles and distributes such a product as a Class I productin several surrounding milk order marketing areas. The witness also notedthat Dean Foods' and its competitors' lowfat eggnog product is not madefrom imitation ingredients, but from fresh milk.Lowfat eggnog is clearly a fluid milk product intended for consumptionas a beverage. Proponent advanced no persuasive basis for reducing returnsto producers for milk disposed of in the form of a flavored fluid milkproduct. Furthermore, classification of all flavored fluid milk productsshould be the same regardless of the type of flavoring used. Dean Foods'ability to market lowfat eggnog classified in Class I in neighboring marketingareas indicates that Superior Dairy should also be able to market sucha product successfully. Producers then would benefit from the expandedoutlet for fluid milk classified, as it should be, as Class I rather thanin a lower class that would reduce producer returns. Further, dairy processorsregulated under other orders apparently are able to process a lowfat eggnogwhich consumers will buy without a reduction in the classification of theproduct. Consumers would have available a lower-fat eggnog at a price competitivewith similar fluid milk products. Consequently, the classification of lowfateggnog should not be reduced to Class II.4. <T3>Temporary increase of pool supply plant delivery requirement to pooldistributing plants. </T3>As noted in the hearing notice, a proposal byMMI and Superior Dairy would have increased temporarily the percentageof milk required to be shipped by pool supply plants to pool distributingplants. At the hearing, MMI withdrew its proposal on the basis that thehearing had not been held in a timely manner, and that the temporary revisionwould no longer be appropriate. A witness for Superior Dairy did not supportthe proposal. There was no further testimony regarding the proposal. Accordingly,no further consideration is given to the proposal in this proceeding.Two additional proposals proposed at the hearing by the Superior Dairyrepresentative could not be considered because they were not included inthe hearing notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions</ITAG>Briefs and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of certaininterested parties.
