With some minor exceptions, their career hopes appear to be quite traditional.    The American Chicle Youth Poll, conducted by The Roper Organization, asked a representative sample of 1,000 youths, ages eight to 17, about their lives and futures. Asked what they wanted to do after graduating from high school, only 20% said they didn't plan to attend college or didn't know what they would do. Seven in 10 said they already know what fields they want to work in when they are adults.    While only 3% picked computers, 31% cited traditional areas like health care, teaching, and trade or blue-collar jobs. An equal number -- 8% -- of girls and boys said they are interested in blue-collar or trade work.    But most of the youths indicated they want to enter fields traditionally associated with one sex. Twenty-four percent of girls, for example, mentioned an interest in health care compared with only 8% of boys. And in the field of education, a traditional career for women, 13% of girls said they planned to be teachers, while only 2% of boys mentioned that profession.    Conversely, sports and athletics were the choice of 10% of boys and no girls; science and engineering were mentioned by 8% of boys, but only 1% of girls; and police/fire protection and aviation were cited by 6% of boys and no girls.    In the face of impending labor shortages, professions that want the best and the brightest may have to try harder in corporate advertising to present role models of the opposite sex -- showing, for example, more male teachers and nurses along with more female engineers and scientists.    Auto Accessories   Despite the fact that nearly 90% of American households own at least one car, the market for automotive products appears far from saturated.    Among respondents to Mediamark Research's 1987 survey of 20,000 consumers, few car owners said they have accessories such as a burglar alarm (4%) or four-wheel drive (5%).    Only 36% of the respondents said they had air conditioning in their car, a surprising result considering that more than half of the U.S. population lives in the Sun Belt. A slightly smaller percentage, 31%, said they have an AM/FM radio with cassette player in their cars.    According to the Census Bureau, 78 million households own more than 137 million vehicles, nearly two per household. With that kind of saturation, growth in the auto industry probably won't come from selling more vehicles per household. Moreover, the group most likely to purchase a new auto -- those between the ages of 18 and 24 -- will shrink 18% by 1995.    The Mediamark survey suggests that there may be additional opportunity for growth in the auto-products business by convincing new-car buyers as well as present owners that they need more accessories in their vehicles.    Cities in Canada   Central cities in Canada are alive and well -- and are prime candidates for U.S. exports and investments.    While some large cities in the U.S. continue to lose population, 22 of the 25 largest municipalities in Canada gained population between 1981 and 1986. Preliminary findings from the 1986 census taken by Statistics Canada, the equivalent of the U.S. Census Bureau, show that, with few exceptions, both cities and suburbs in Canada are growing. (The exceptions were Montreal, Canada's largest city, which lost 0.3% of its population, Quebec City and North York.)    Toronto's population, for example, increased by 2.2%, while the number of residents in the city's metropolitan area rose by 9.5%. The biggest jump occurred in Brampton, a city of nearly 200,000 near Toronto, which grew by 26.5% and is now about the same size as Dayton, Ohio.    Despite the population increases in metropolitan areas, Canada's overall rate of growth fell to 4.2% between 1981 and 1986 from 9.7% two decades earlier, primarily because of low immigration and very low growth in rural areas. By comparison, the number of Americans increased by 5.3% between 1980 and 1985, but eight of the 25 biggest U.S. cities lost population.    While Canada's total population is only about 10% of the U.S. total, its many medium-sized and prosperous cities make it an attractive urban market. Nearly one-third of all Canadians live in just three metropolitan areas -- Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. </TEXT></DOC>
