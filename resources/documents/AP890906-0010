Colombia's conscript soldiers are no match for the well-paidprivate armies of drug lords. They are poorly trained, equipped, andpaid, typically earning only $2 a month, and most are teen-age farmboys who just want to get home alive.   The country's police generally earn $110 a month, $10 above theminimum wage.   Narcotics traffickers, with vast bankrolls, have a total army of4,000 men who are paid as much as $2,000 a month each. They havetheir own intelligence units and sophisticated global communications.   Drug lords have plenty of the latest small weapons and evenairplanes and helicopters armed with machine guns, a source withanti-narcotics police has said. They are known to haveshoulder-fired light anti-tank weapons and rifle grenades.   Police sources say Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the majorsuspects, has a twin-engine Cessna airplane armed withelectronically fired M60 machine guns, and four helicopters, eacharmed with two M60 machine guns.   Colombia has an army of 200,000 men and a national police forceof 80,000, both under the Defense Ministry. A colonel at the DefenseMinistry said privately only about 20,000 of the total were involvedin day-to-day operations against drug traffickers and leftistguerrillas.   A U.S. narcotics officer in Bogota told The Associated Pressinfiltration of the security forces was a serious problem. He saidan army colonel could earn up to $15,000 a month by tipping offtraffickers about raids and providing other information.   A former Colombian army intelligence officer said one raid on adrug traffickers' hideout turned up records showing he paid $100,000a month for information.   Drug cartels also are believed to exercise heavy influence onColombia's lawmakers and judges.   The richest of Colombia's suspected drug traffickers, PabloEscobar, was a member of Congress while he was amassing hiscocaine-smuggling fortune.   Everyone knew it, and no one seemed to care until it became amajor embarrassment to the Congress.   Few cases actually come to light because proof is difficult tofind, but Colombians generally agree that many of their congressmenare on the take from drug traffickers.   No president or Cabinet minister has ever been proven to belinked to drug traffickers.   However, Colombia's political parties and the Congress haverefused to adopt legislation that would make life very difficult fordrug traffickers.   For instance, they have failed to move rapidly to revampColombia's antiquated courts and laws that make it easy for arresteddrug traffickers to slip through loopholes.   They also have sent hamstrung security forces to fight the drugtraffickers.   There are some small, elite units with up-to-date training andequipment, such as a 2,000-member anti-narcotics unit attached tothe national police.   However, the majority of the army and police labor away withoutthe resources to make a real dent in the drug smuggling thatprovides most of the cocaine for U.S. markets.   While soldiers in big cities generally look neat, troops inremote areas often wear old, ill-fitting boots and carry rucksacksthat appear as if they are about to fall apart.   It is common to find 30-year-old communications equipment that nolonger works.   Army patrols have been seen flagging down rural buses fortransportation in the vast plains and jungle regions of southernColombia. They have sallied forth into anti-drug battles in thenorth in banana-hauling trucks.   An agent of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Colombiaonce said Colombian anti-narcotics police had to beg gasoline fromthe DEA before mounting a raid.   Colombia normally gets $10 million a year in equipment andtraining from the United States for fighting drug trafficking.Another $5.5 million goes mostly for spare parts.   In addition, President Bush has sent $65 million in equipmentfrom an emergency fund.   Last week, a U.S. narcotics officer at the Embassy told reportersthat Colombia could use $200 million a year in foreign aid forfighting drug smugglers.   It remains to be seen how much the U.S. equipment will help.   Two C-130 cargo planes that were turned over to the Colombians onSunday, for example, are each 30 years old, according to a U.S.diplomatic source.   The drug traffickers can often afford the best equipment and mostdaring fighters.   Bogota newspapers have said traffickers offered $500,000 for asingle killing: the assassination last month of leading presidentialcandidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.   Informants have told narcotics police that members of drug cartelforces compete vigorously for murder contracts because success meanslots of money and favors that could make them rich.   Rodriguez Gacha, who used to be a pig farmer, is now abillionaire cocaine trafficker in the Medellin cartel.   Another member of the cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, ranked highin Forbes magazine's ranking of world billionaires this year withbetween $2 billion and $3 billion.   He was once a car thief and pickpocket.</TEXT></DOC>
