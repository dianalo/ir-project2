Thomas H.Kean told a subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee.   ``Providing a quality education today entails taking risks. ...This bill commits school districts to higher academic achievementin return for flexibility in dealing with federal and stateregulations,'' said Kean. ``It's a trade of professional freedomfor accountability.''   The bill, introduced by Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., would make theprogram voluntary and stipulate that participation would becanceled if student achievements worsen within two years.   Kean submitted a statement from the National Governors'Association that praised the ``concept and policy direction'' ofthe legislation but said the measure needs more work in clearlystating the financing and monitoring arrangements.   AFT President Albert Shanker stressed that the performance goalsshould be clearly defined as well as how achievements will beassessed.   But Shanker added, ``I think the overall framework of gettingpeople at the local level to come up with some new ideas andplanning, getting commitment on the part of all the constitutents,combining sums of money ... I think the entire framework isexcellent.''   Opposing the bill, the committee chairman, Rep. AugustusHawkins, D-Calif., told the hearing by the Subcommittee onElementary, Secondary and Vocational Education that the measure mayset a ``dangerous trend.'' He reminded committee members of theinitial problems with the federal Chapter One program fordisadvantaged children.   ``We found that Chapter One was being expended _ even though itwas getting positive results _ for football fields, for swimmingpools, for faculty lounges and so forth and not for the academicimprovement of the children,'' said Hawkins. ``So we had to comeback 15 to 20 times'' and insert protections in the law.   Hawkins also noted that Congress got involved in education``because of the neglect that we found.''   ``We had to legislate to get handicapped kids into theclassroom. We had to legislate on the federal level to getdisadvantaged children who were picking crops back into theclassroom. We've had to go through this process. It worries me whatregulations are going to be suspended or altered,'' he said.   Smith, an educator and former Vermont lieutenant governor,introduced the bill days before the historic education summit thatconcluded with an agreement that national performance goals wouldbe developed and federal regulations tied to key education programswould be loosened.   ``The summit, and the attention it commanded, have given us anextraordinary opportunity here in Congress to work with theadministration and the governors toward a national policy that willrestructure our public school system for the better,'' Smith toldthe subcommittee.   Smith said the bill was written in direct response to complaintsof educators that ``quality education has suffered as governmentrules and regulations have stiffened.''   ``It is offered as both a solution and a challenge, because itbasically says to our educators, if you can do better with fewerrules and regulations, prove it,'' he said.   Smith said the bill also stresses that the civil rights ofstudents ``in no way, shape or form can be abridged.''</TEXT></DOC>
