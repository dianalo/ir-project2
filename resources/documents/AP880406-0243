(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Auto Workers union officialsgathering today to formulate contract demands for Chrysler Corp.also prepared for a potentially bitter debate over the contractstatus of workers at the company's Kenosha, Wis. plant.   Separately, UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said the union mayseek contract provisions to guarantee that workers receiveprofit-sharing bonuses whenever Chrysler executives receivebonuses, regardless of the company's performance.   Union representatives began gathering Tuesday to prepare for theApril 18th opening of contract talks with the nation'sthird-largest automaker.   In addition to contract demands, the 140-member UAW nationalChrysler Council also was faced with the potentially divisive issueof whether 800 to 1,000 former American Motors Corp. workers inKenosha should be brought under the national Chrysler contract.   Chrysler, which bought AMC last year, decided earlier this yearto close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha by year's end,leaving only an engine plant and some metal-stamping operationsoperating.   Stepp said he wants to include the remaining workers,represented by UAW Local 72, under the Chrysler contract _ whichcovers 59,500 active and 8,000 laid-off workers at 49 local unions.He said the Kenosha workers now are Chrysler employees and he wantsto prevent Chrysler from moving their work _ they build engines forJeeps assembled at a plant in Toledo, Ohio _ to factories in Mexicoor Canada.   But other Chrysler workers said admitting the Kenosha workerswould take jobs away from workers laid off from Chrysler plants.Workers from closed Chrysler plants have the right to move intojobs that open through attrition at other factories _ a privilegethat would be extended to the Kenosha workers if they came underthe national pact.   Chrysler workers said the issue was sensitive because of theautomaker's recent attempt to sell its 28,000-worker Acustar Inc.parts subsidiary. Chrysler terminated that proposal in early Marchin the face of bitter UAW opposition including the threat ofcrippling plant-by-plant strikes.   ``How can you accept them into the Chrysler council when ourpeople aren't even secure yet _ Acustar or Chrysler ?'' said TonyDeFrancesco, bargaining chairman of Local 624 at Chrysler NewProcess Gear plant in Syracuse, N.Y.   The Syracuse plant, which makes manual front-wheel-drivetransmissions, is part of Acustar.   But Stepp said he believed much of the opposition came from fearthat the soon-to-be-laid-off Kenosha assembly workers also would beincluded, which they would not.   He also argued that the UAW historically has brought businessand plants purchased by automakers _ such as the Syracuse plant _under those companies' national contracts, usually resulting inincreased wages and benefits for the new additions.   The council was to discuss proposed demands today and vote on ademand package Thursday. Stepp said the package, which in most wayswill mirror contracts signed last fall at General Motors Corp. andFord Motor Co., also may seek to guarantee workers a share ofprofits whenever corporate executives receive bonuses.   The Ford and GM contracts include worker profit-sharing paymentsbased on sales and the companies' financial performance. But Steppsaid that because executives receive bonuses regardless of theircompanies' performance, so should workers.   The UAW also wants to close potential loopholes that haveappeared in the job protection provisions in the Ford and GMcontracts, Stepp said.   Both pacts forbid plant closings that were not announced beforelast year's negotiations but allow workers to be laid off if salesof a product fall.   GM has said it will idle two plants indefinitely later this yearbecause sales of their products are slow.</TEXT></DOC>
