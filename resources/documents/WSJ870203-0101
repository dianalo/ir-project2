He said: &quot;Enacting the Soviet negotiating position into American law would not be the way to win a good agreement.&quot; Less than 48 hours later, four senators began doing precisely that by introducing a bill to severely curtail new military deployments.    Sens. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.), Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), John Chafee (R., R.I.) and John Heinz (R., Pa.) offered legislation to bar funding for military deployments that exceed the SALT II limits -- a treaty the Senate never ratified and that has expired. This follows on a December action in which 57 senators signed a letter urging President Reagan to reverse his decision to stop abiding by the SALT treaty.    These efforts come despite clear evidence of Soviet violations. Specifically, the Soviets are deploying more than one new type of intercontinental ballistic missile -- namely, the SS-24 and SS-25. They are encrypting telemetry data on test missiles and they are exceeding the overall limit of 2,504 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.    The Senate's grand efforts to legislate arms control comes at the same time that two significant assessments of the limitations of the arms-control process are appearing. One, by the Kennedy School of Government, was recently discussed in this space (&quot;Lessons of Arms Control,&quot; Dec. 22). Now a new study is making the rounds in Washington. &quot;Why the Soviets Violate Arms Control Treaties,&quot; commissioned by the U.S. government, was written by Joseph D. Douglass Jr., a Virginia-based national security affairs consultant.    At the core, the Douglass study says, the U.S. and Soviet Union bring two fundamentally different views to the arms-control process. While the U.S. sees it as an effort to restrain new weapons deployments and lessen bilateral tensions, the Soviets view the process as an integral part of their program of military modernization and expansion. They want to constrain U.S. military rebuilding, but at the same time permit the Soviet Union to conduct the research, development and deployment it had always planned to do.    The main goals are to &quot;debilitate U.S. defense planning and acquisition,&quot; split the Western alliance, rally Western anti-military sentiment and &quot;promote the Soviet image of peace-loving and that of the United States as war-mongering.&quot; The Kremlin also uses arms control as a lever to facilitate trade, foreign credits and technology transfer.    The Soviets prefer to structure treaties so that only the U.S. is constrained. But &quot;the Soviets will violate or otherwise cheat on any treaty when it is determined to further their interests,&quot; Mr. Douglass says. &quot;Soviet planning for cheating and deception on arms control agreements begins well in advance of any specific agreement,&quot; he says. This encompasses hiding Randamp;D work, concealing tests and deployments and misleading the U.S. about the nature of Soviet programs. This has occurred, Mr. Douglass adds, not only in strategic nuclear forces but also in biological and chemical weaponry.    One former Czech official, for instance, tells of a 1966 address by Marshal Andrei Grechko, then-commander in chief of the Warsaw Pact forces, to East-bloc defense ministers and military chiefs. Marshal Grechko said that any arms-control accords had to conceal Soviet military capabilities and must be used against the Western military-industrial complex.    There are no doubt points on which Mr. Douglass and the authors of the recent Kennedy School report from Harvard would significantly disagree. What they share in common, however, is that both raise serious questions about the integrity of the process as it is generally represented to the public and its utility for U.S. interests.    These questions deserve to be discussed and debated openly, and there was a time when one might have expected that process to be generated on Capitol Hill. But no such seriousness of effort or thought emanates from the Senate, the World's Greatest Deliberative Body. The WGDB can do little more than resuscitate an expired treaty, with little more supportive argument than that it will all work out fine if the U.S. unilaterally conforms to the restraints of a nuclear treaty negotiated by Jimmy Carter.    Somehow the public deserves better from the senators in the WGDB. Those favoring SALT II should explain how continued adherence would further U.S. security and stop the Soviets from programmed cheating. Two major studies have now said that many of the assumptions behind the traditional arms-control process are flawed. The senators may, if they wish, stick their heads in the sand of SALT II, but they shouldn't complain too loudly if the president or the public doesn't join them. </TEXT></DOC>
