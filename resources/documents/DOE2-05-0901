Both the wasted heatof the process return condensate and the flue gases are utilized forlow temperature feedwater and fuel heating. The steam saved, both fromthe main steam line and turbine extraction system, was found to increasethe steam and plant overall efficiency by 18%. An alternative cogenerationenergy plant is presented in the second part of this study. The proposedplant utilizes the gas turbine exhaust, in conjunction with a heat recoveryboiler, to produce the process steam requirement. With this alternativeplant, the overall efficiency increases by 31.6%, while the steam efficiencyincreases by 19%. The outstanding features and advantages of the proposedplants are highlighted.</TEXT></DOC>
