The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations (34CFR Part 668) apply to all institutions that seek to participate in theTitle IV, HEA programs.The proposed changes in these regulations result from a review of currentpolicies and procedures. The review identified possible legislative, regulatory,and administrative changes necessary to protect, enhance, and improve theintegrity of the Title IV, HEA programs. A summary of the significant proposedregulatory changes follows:Section 600.30 Institutional changes requiring review by the SecretaryThe Secretary proposes to add a requirement to paragraph (a)(4) that aninstitution report to the Secretary any change in the institution's ownershipthat results in an individual acquiring or increasing his or her stockholdings to at least 25% of the stock of the institution or its parentcorporation. The requirement enables the Secretary to evaluate compliancewith the proposed new factor of financial responsibility (see the discussionon andSection;668.13). The requirement allows an evaluation of an institution'scompliance with the new factor of financial responsibility at the timeof the ownership change.Section 600.32 Eligibility of additional locationsThe Secretary proposes to add a section to clarify the special conditionsgoverning the eligibility of additional locations that were not includedin an institution's original eligibility determination. This section codifiesthe existing Department practice, which is based on the concept that theaddition of a location to an already existing institution is similar tothat institution's addition of new educational programs. In general, thatpractice allows an additional location to qualify for eligibility by meetingthe applicable institutional eligibility requirements of this part exceptthe requirement to have been in existence for two years.To address a serious abuse of HEA program funds, the Secretary also proposesan exception to this treatment for one particular category of new location.Currently, an eligible institution that owes a liability on misspent orunspent HEA program funds or has an agreement with the Secretary to repaythat liability, can close or cease to provide educational programs withoutrepaying that liability or honoring that agreement. The owner of the institutioncan sell its assets or the assets of any of its campuses to the owner ofanother eligible institution. Ordinarily, under the provisions of andSection;600.31governing changes of ownership resulting in a change of control, an acquisitionof the assets of an institution that was previously eligible requires thenew owner to assume sole responsibility, or joint responsibility with theprevious owner, for any liabilities on HEA program funds incurred by theinstitution that was previously eligible. The new owner's refusal to assumethat responsibility would delay the participation of the newly acquiredinstitution in the HEA programs for at least two years, except in the caseof certain public or private nonprofit institutions.However, because the requirement to be in existence for at least two yearsdoes not generally apply to additional locations established by a currentlyeligible institution, the new owner in the above situation can avoid bothresponsibility for previous liabilities of the acquired institution andthe two-year delay if he or she also owns a currently eligible institution.The new owner need only convert the newly acquired institution into anadditional campus of the currently eligible institution. In fact, thistactic is becoming a more common occurrence among institutions that closewhile owing large liabilities to the Department of Education. In threerecent cases, major chains of business and technical schools misused HEAfunds to the extent that tens of millions of dollars in liabilities areowed to the Department of Education. In each case the owners of the chainclosed their schools and thereby attempted to abandon their responsibilityfor those misused funds. Those owners also sold the closed schools to ownersof chains of currently eligible business and technical schools. In eachcase, the new owners, by acquiring the assets (but not the liabilities)of the closed schools and converting them into additional campuses of theschools that were already eligible, substantially enlarged their own operations,and were able to fund that expansion with an increased flow of Departmentof Education funds.The exception in this section would apply all the eligibility requirements,including the ``two-year-in-existence'' requirement, where relevant, toan additional location acquired from a closed institution, unless the ownerof the acquiring institution agrees to be liable for all misspent or unspentHEA program funds received by the institution that was previously eligible.The Secretary believes that the purchaser of the closed institution isfacilitating the previous owner's ability to escape responsibility forany liabilities incurred while he or she owned the institution. The Secretaryalso believes that, like any other purchaser of an institution that isor was eligible, a purchaser in this situation should assume the liabilitiesas well as the assets of the closed institution.<T3>Section 668.7 Eligible student </T3>The Secretary proposes to add a new criterion to the definition of <T3>eligible student</T3>. A new paragraph (a)(11) would require a student,at the time that he or she is about to receive cash from the Title IV,HEA programs for the first time, to present credible identification tothe institution at which he or she is enrolled or accepted for enrollment.Through impersonation, ineligible individuals sometimes obtain Title IV,HEA program funds. This provision is designed to discourage those individuals.The proposed requirement would apply only to a student who will receivecash from the Title IV, HEA programs, not to a student whose Title IV,HEA program aid is credited entirely to his or her institutional account.In addition, the proposed requirement would be a one-time requirement,in that it would apply only the first time that a student is about to receivecash from the Title IV, HEA programs for attendance at the student's institution.The provision would not require a student, for example, to present credibleidentification for the first receipt of cash in each academic year, orfor the first receipt of cash from each Title IV, HEA program. The proposedrequirement also includes examples of documents that constitute credibleidentification. An institution must document that an applicant for TitleIV, HEA program assistance has presented the required identification.<T3>Section 668.12 Institutional participation agreement</T3>The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (a) to require that in orderfor an institution to begin participation in a Title IV, HEA program, both(1) the institution's chief administrator or, except for a for-profit institution,another administrative official designated by the chief administrator,and (2) the designated individual who will be responsible for administeringthat Title IV, HEA program at that institution must complete Title IV,HEA program training offered by the Secretary. This proposed change wouldapply to any institution applying for participation in a Title IV, HEAprogram for the first time. For example, if a for-profit institution thatcurrently participates only in the Pell Grant Program wishes to participatein the College Work-Study Program, the institution must send both its chiefadministrator and financial aid administrator to the Title IV, HEA programtraining provided by the Secretary before the institution can participatein the College Work-Study Program. The Secretary is concerned that manyindividuals at institutions that have not previously participated in aspecific Title IV, HEA program may lack experience and adequate knowledgeconcerning the administration of that program.<T3>Section 668.13 Factors of financial responsibility</T3>The Secretary proposes to amend this section to provide that an institutionis not considered to be financially responsible if the institution undergoesa change in its ownership that allows an individual to own at least 25%of the stock of the institution or its parent corporation and all of thefollowing conditions apply:1. The individual previously did not own at least 25% of the stock of theinstitution or its parent corporation.2. The individual previously owned at least 25% of the stock of a defunctinstitution (defined for purposes of this section as one which closed orstopped providing educational programs) or defunct institution's parentcorporation when the defunct institution became defunct.3. The individual, the defunct institution, or the defunct institution'sparent corporation owes a liability to the Secretary on misspent or unspentTitle IV, HEA funds received by the defunct institution.4. The liable party is in default on an agreement to repay that liability,if such an agreement exists.5. The institution cannot show that the individual lacks the ability toaffect substantially its actions or lacked the ability to affect substantiallythe actions of the defunct institution.6. The individual has not repaid a portion of the subject liability proportionateto his or her ownership in the defunct institution.Under current regulations, the owner of a defunct institution is able,even if he or she owes or has agreed to pay the Secretary a liability formisspent or unspent Title IV, HEA program funds received by that institution,to purchase part or all of another eligible institution without satisfyingany part of the defunct institution's preexisting liability. Further, anindividual who owns enough stock to control or to affect substantiallythe actions of a defunct institution or its parent corporation may notbe held personally responsible for any misspent or unspent Title IV, HEAprogram funds received by that institution. An individual in this secondcircumstance is protected by the corporate structure of the defunct institution.Thus, that individual can also purchase part or all of another eligibleinstitution and continue to participate in Title IV, HEA programs withouthelping to pay any portion of the liability owed by the defunct institution.The proposed regulations would prevent individuals closely associated withpast mishandling of Title IV, HEA program funds from exerting an influenceover the activities of currently participating institutions.Clearly, the ownership of more than 50% of an institution or its parentcorporation confers an ability to affect, and even control, the actionsof that institution. However, these proposed regulations reflect the factthat the Secretary also considers the ownership of at least 25% of thestock of an institution or its parent corporation generally to constituteability to affect substantially the actions of the institution. An institutionwill be considered financially responsible under these provisions if itcan show that its new major stockholder who previously was a major stockholderof a defunct institution or parent corporation does not have the abilityto affect substantially the actions of the currently participating institutionor did not have the ability to affect substantially the defunct institution'sactions.<T3>Section 668.20 Limitations on remedial coursework that is eligiblefor Title IV, HEA program assistance.</T3>The Secretary proposes to amend this section to require that, to be eligiblefor Title IV, HEA program assistance, remedial coursework must be providedat least at the secondary school level. The determination of whether theremedial coursework is at least secondary is left to the institution offeringthe coursework, unless, if applicable, the institution's nationally recognizedaccrediting agency or association or State legally authorizing or approvalagency has procedures for making that determination. Even though TitleIV, HEA program funds are intended for students receiving postsecondaryeducation, some students have received aid to pay for remedial coursestaught at a level as low as fourth grade. The HEA permits a certain amountof remedial coursework to be eligible for Title IV, HEA program assistance.However, the Secretary does not believe that postsecondary educationalassistance is intended for individuals who have not achieved a level ofability to pursue remedial coursework at the secondary level.<T3>Section 668.23 Audits, records and examination.</T3>The Secretary proposes to amend paragraph (b) of this section to clarifythat a participating institution must give the Secretary, the InspectorGeneral of the Department of Education, and the Comptroller General, ortheir authorized representatives timely access to the institution's financialaid-related records and access to institutional personnel involved withthe administration of Title IV, HEA program funds. Recently, some institutionshave denied the Office of Inspector General (OIG) the right to copy documentsrelated to their participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. Some institutionshave also inordinately delayed providing records to the OIG. This proposalclarifies the Secretary's existing policy, which appears to have been subjectto misinterpretation by some institutions.<T3>Section 668.90 Initial and final decisions_Appeals</T3>The Secretary proposes to amend this section to provide for the terminationof an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs if theinstitution fails to submit the audit report required under andSection; 668.23by the applicable statutory or regulatory deadline and either fails torespond in the manner required under andSection; 668.84 to the notices fromthe designated department official proposing fines or has a history ofmissing the deadlines over a period of four years. In addition, an administrativelaw judge would have to uphold a termination action taken against an institutionfor these reasons.These audits are critical to the enforcement of Title IV, HEA program requirements,yet many schools have not submitted the audits, some for as many as sixyears. The Department of Education recently developed a computer systemto track the submission of required biennial non-Federal audits. This systemhad identified over 1,500 schools with overdue audit reports for the awardyears 1981-85. Notices requiring submission of the reports, requestingexplanations, and proposing fines, have been sent to the schools underthe procedures in andSection; 668.84. In response, 418 audit reports havebeen submitted, fines totalling $423,000 have been proposed, and $120,000in fines has been collected.The procedures used by the Department allow schools to provide explanationsfor their failure to meet the audit report deadlines, permit extensionsfor those schools whose failure is found to be based on sufficiently mitigatingcircumstances, and propose fines for the late submission of audit reportswhere those fines are considered appropriate. The Secretary believes thatan institution that fails to meet the audit report deadlines and failsto provide the responses required by regulations to the subsequent noticesfrom the designated department official or an institution that has a recordof consistently failing to submit its audit reports by the applicable deadlinesshould be subject to termination from participation in the Title IV, HEAprograms.The Secretary also proposes to amend this section to require the administrativelaw judge to uphold a termination action against an institution based onthe grounds that the institution is not financially responsible under thechanges proposed in andSection; 668.13, unless the institution can show thatthe liable individual has paid the applicable portion of the liabilityor is not able to affect substantially the actions of the institution whosetermination is being considered. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.
