Worry about inflationary pressures preoccupied many economistslast year, but that pressure has not produced an acceleration ininflation thus far.   The 4.4 percent gain in the Labor Department's Consumer PriceIndex matched the 1987 increase, which was the highest since 1981but was four times the 1.1 percent rate in 1986, a 25-year low.   A 0.3 percent rise in the index in December, which followed a 0.3percent November increase, helped inflation finish the year at amoderate pace.   The summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures,pushed food prices for the year up 5.2 percent, the steepest risesince 1980.   Poultry and egg prices jumped 17.9 percent and 16.5 percent,respectively, because of the drought.   On the other hand, beef and pork prices, which rose for the firstsix months of the year, fell during the second half as farmers sentmore animals to slaughter as a way of avoiding high feed costs.   Energy for the year rose only a slight 0.5 percent following an8.2 percent jump in 1987. Still, they were far below levels beforethe 1986 oil glut,when energy prices plummeted 19.7 percent.   Fuel oil prices jumped 2.8 percent in December after falling forsix consecutive months. Despite the December advance, the price was6.3 percent below that of a year earlier. Electricity charges rose1.1 percent for the year, while natural gas was unchanged.   Gasoline prices were 1.1 percent lower than a year ago. Priceincreases for new and used cars also were moderate, 2.1 percent and3.4 percent, respectively. However, the prices of auto insurance andof financing car purchases took steep jumps of 8.4 percent and 8.3percent, respectively.   The cost of medical care, up 6.9 percent, also rose faster thanthe general inflation rate last year.   Tobacco prices posted one of the steepest rises of anysubcatagory, up 9.4 percent for the year.   Clothing prices rose 4.8 percent overall, with men's and boys'apparel up 6.0 percent and women's and girls' clothing up 3.4percent.   December's 0.3 percent increase left the price index at 120.5percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selectionof goods costing $100 during the base period would have cost $120.50in December. That figure was up 20 cents from November.   President Reagan, who is preparing to leave office Friday, haslisted the taming of inflation as one of his proudestaccomplishments. Under his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, the nation sawdouble-digit price increases of 13.3 percent in 1979 and 12.5percent in 1980.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report shows thatinflation ``continues to show signs of moderation. Inflation hasbeen going down since September.''   Many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste ofthe bad old days this year. They say tight labor markets and risingfactory operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs forconsumers.   The factory operating rate in December was 84.2 percent, thehighest in nine years. The higher the rate, the greater thelikelihood of shortages and price increases.   At 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate was the lowest in 14 years.Labor shortages in some states, particularly in the Northeast, havealready pushed up wages for entry-level jobs.   But other analysts say consumer resistance and foreigncompetition are helping to dampen price increases.   ``It's difficult to pass along cost pressures,'' said DonaldRatajczak, an economist with Georgia State University. ``Consumerswill back off and wait a couple of months to see if they can get aprice discount.   ``Domestic (production) capacity pressures ... probably don'tmean as much as they once did. There are resources readily availableoffshore if our prices start to rise.''   Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve Board, whose prime job as thenation's central bank is keeping inflation under control, has beenpushing interest rates slowly but steadily higher since March in aneffort to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., aLexington, Mass., forecasting firm, joined Ratajczak in predictingonly a modest speedup in price increases this year.   ``I have more confidence in the ... Fed than I ever did,'' shesaid. ``I think they'll have real trouble getting inflation down tothe 2 percent range, but I think they'll keep it from accelerating.''</TEXT></DOC>
