The childrenjockeyed for views.   In Van Cortlandt Park, an oasis in the Bronx that has been hometo animals ranging from snapping turtles to two white-tailed deerspotted last year, DeSimone taught the children to be naturedetectives and park stewards.   He is one of New York City's 68 urban park rangers, a group ofgoodwill ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of citydwellers about the nature around them.   The program in the nation's largest city, now in its 10th year,has become a model. Park ranger programs have started in about 15cities, including Seattle, Philadelphia, Boston and Cleveland. Theprograms are independent from the National Park Service, whichoversees federal wilderness areas.   ``Park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in anypark,'' said Mary Kimmitt, deputy director of the PhiladelphiaRanger Corps, which started a year ago.   In some areas, the presence of rangers helps keep down the crimerate. In New York's Central Park, for instance, the number offelonies dropped 28 percent in the last four years; robberies alonefell 40 percent.   ``We're trying to get people back in the parks,'' said ThereseBraddick, director of New York's urban rangers. ``Some peoplebelieve they're not safe, and at night many areas aren't.''   Still, while law enforcement in New York's parks is handled bypolice and a 180-member park patrol squad, Ms. Braddick said, ``Weprovide a sense of security for people.''   Besides, rangers show New Yorkers that their backyard is not allconcrete. Last year, 84,000 people attended 2,618 educationalprograms held by the rangers.   ``When you think of Manhattan, the picture of beautiful park landdoesn't come to mind,'' Ms. Braddick said.   And yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26,000 acresof parks.   There are 30 species of ducks, 10 species of owls, 15 types ofhawks and falcons, red foxes, snapping turtles, raccoons, skunks,and, occasionally, deer from Westchester County to the north. Theareas have about 30 types of endangered plants, including the wingedmonkey flower.   New York's first park, Bowling Green, was created in 1733. Thecity set aside land for Central Park in the mid-1850s, created theDepartment of Parks in 1870 and during commissioner Robert Moses'tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park acreage.   There is little left to put aside now. ``The city has filled itsborders,'' said park historian Jonathan Kuhn.   The end of major park expansion makes the current public landthat much more important, rangers say.   One place Braddick loves to visit is Pelham Bay Park in theBronx, with its salt marsh, mud flats, 13 miles of rocky shorelineand 520 acres of forest.   Herman Barrocales, 33, fished in Brooklyn's Prospect Park when hewas a boy. Now he is a park ranger stationed there. One of his jobsis to lead hawk watches.   On a crisp morning recently, he passed around binoculars on asecond story terrace in Prospect Park's Boathouse. He told the dozenpeople who came by that New York was a choice location to see hawksas it is on their fly path from Canada to warmer spots.   In an hour, five birds of prey were sighted, including the rareperegrine falcon. The falcon took its time in passing. Barrocales,normally talkative, barely said a word as he watched.   The children from P.S. 122 who visited Van Cortlandt Park alsowere impressed by the wildlife around them.   After listening to DeSimone's message that they should take careof the parks _ underscored as he picked up a plastic six-pack holderand broke its rings, which can strangle ducks _ 11 year-old LanetteRomero said she had learned a lesson:   ``You should keep your eyes open, make sure you don't harmanimals and look for clues like footprints.''   After school, she was going to the library, she said. ``I'm goingto find more out about muskrats.''</TEXT></DOC>
