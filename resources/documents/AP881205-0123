(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Airmen posing asincapacitated astronauts were rescued from a mock smoke-filledshuttle during a simulated landing for ground crews awaitingAtlantis' return from space.   ``Our purpose is to make sure we're ready for the real thing _whenever it is,'' said Chuck Spern, who directed Sunday's exerciseas shuttle recovery convoy commander for the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration.   NASA and the Air Force said they would give 24 hours advancenotice before Atlantis and its five-member crew end a secretmilitary mission by touching down at this Mojave Desert base 80miles north of Los Angeles.   There was no announcement by midday today, but sources at CapeCanaveral, Fla., where the shuttle was launched, said today thatAtlantis would land Tuesday afternoon, four days after the missionbegan.   A list of landing-related tasks displayed during a briefing forSunday's simulation said the actual landing would be four to sevendays after the launch.   Sunday's mock landing was conducted as Atlantis' astronautscontinued the classified flight. The sources, who spoke on conditionof anonymity, said they successfully deployed what is believed to bea $500 million radar satellite that will spy on Soviet bloc nationsand guide the new B-2 stealth bomber.   The extra security for the shuttle mission was apparent duringthe simulation. The Air Force refused to let reporters andphotographers accompany the recovery convoy. During a briefingbefore the exercise, convoy members were warned not to carrypersonal cameras and to keep radio chatter to a minimum.   About 130 members of the convoy slowly drove some two dozenvehicles onto the hard clay of Rogers Dry Lake as the landingexercise began. They were joined by 50 military police officers,although 250 will be on hand for the real landing, said Col. RichTillstrom, the Air Force's site commander.   A mysterious Defense Department vehicle accompanied the usualconvoy vehicles: fire trucks, vans to transport astronauts and checkfor toxic and explosive gases, a trailer with a vapor-dispersingfan, the shuttle tow tug, and trucks to cool the shuttle and purgeit of fumes.   Spern said only that the vehicle was unique to Atlantis'classified mission. Lt. Col. Jerry Guess, an Air Force spokesman,declined to identify the type of vehicle or its purpose.   About an hour after the convoy headed onto the lakebed,simulation participants were told the shuttle made a normal landing.A full-scale shuttle nose cone and crew module, hauled atop a truck,carried airmen portraying astronauts.   Then officials controlling the simulation declared a ``mode six''emergency in which ``there is smoke in the cabin and the crew isincapacitated _ they can't see and are having trouble breathing,''Spern said.   Air Force teams then rushed to the mock shuttle, extracted thefake astronauts, carried them on stretchers to a triage area 500feet from the nose cone, pretended to provide emergency medical careand then loaded them on two helicopters for what would be a ride toa hospital.   ``It's just practice,'' Tillstrom said. ``We go through the samechecklist and sequence of events we do for a landing, plus we takethe opportunity to practice emergency procedures.''   Weather forecasts in the Mojave appeared favorable for a landing,with Air Force meteorologists predicting high scattered clouds,light and variable wind, clear visibility and high temperatures inthe 60s well into the week.   Atlantis, which was launched Friday on the second post-Challengerdisaster shuttle flight, is expected to return to Kennedy SpaceCenter in Florida about five days after it lands. As usual, it willride piggyback aboard a modified Boeing 747 jet.</TEXT></DOC>
