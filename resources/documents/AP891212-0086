North told acourt today he is having difficulty separating his own experiencesin the Iran-Contra scandal from the testimony that ex-nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter gave Congress under immunity fromprosecution.   At a pre-trial hearing in the criminal case against Poindexter,North said Poindexter's five-day appearance on Capitol Hill in July1987 constituted some of the most ``powerful'' testimony of thecongressional hearings into the scandal and that he watched itclosely.   ``I read the transcript'' of Poindexter's testimony, said North,who Iran-Contra prosecutors want to use as a government witness inPoindexter's trial.   Under a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, the government may make nouse of a defendant's testimony that was compelled under a limitedgrant of immunity from prosecution. That includes testimony givenby other witnesses who may have been influenced by the immunizedstatements.   Today's hearing was called so that U.S. District Judge HaroldGreene can determine whether North was tainted by Poindexter'stestimony.   The former National Security Council aide, returning to thecourthouse where he was convicted of three felonies, initiallyinvoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination whencalled to the witness stand.   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh then obtainedfrom Greene an order compelling North to testify in exchange for apromise not to prosecute him for his statements, as long as hetells the truth.   North said he was unable to recall crucial details thatprosecutors want to focus on in their case against Poindexter.   He said he was unable to remember telling Poindexter about falsestatements in letters to Congress denying that North was assistingthe Contra rebels in Nicaragua when such aid was banned by law.   ``Did you have discussions with Admiral Poindexter before theletter was sent ... about the false nature of the response?'' askedIran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb.   ``I don't recall,'' North replied.   Poindexter faces trial Jan. 22 on criminal charges of conspiracyand two counts each of obstructing Congress and making falsestatements in connection with Iran-Contra.   Poindexter told Congress that he made no effort to prevent Northfrom destroying a notebook containing information about a November1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.   Poindexter also testified that he withheld information fromCongress on National Security Council activities to aid the Contrasin order to avoid publicity and more restrictive legislation. In1985 and 1986, Congress banned military aid to the rebel force byU.S. intelligence agencies.   The former national security adviser is accused of falselytelling Congress that no one in the U.S. government knew until 1986that the 1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawks. He also is accusedof falsely denying to Congress that North and the NSC staff didn'tsolicit funds or offer tactical advice to the Contras.   North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstructionof Congress, accepting an illegal gratuity and of destroyinggovernment documents.   He was sentenced July 5 to 1,200 hours of community service anda $150,000 fine. North is appealing the convictions and the finewhile serving the community service in an anti-drug program.   On Monday, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh disclosed thatPresident Bush had turned aside Walsh's request for a face-to-facemeeting with the president.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that thedecision against a meeting with Walsh ``was the recommendation ofcounsel (White House counsel Boyden Gray), which the presidentaccepted and agrees with. We should not be involved in the legalprocess and the court system.''   Fitzwater said the cases themselves and legal ramifications``are subjects that should be discussed between the attorneygeneral, who is the president's lawyer, and the independentcounsel.''   ``On substance, our responsiblity is to protect classifiedinformation an to protect methods and sources and so forth that arepart ofthat and we feel we have to meet that responsiblity and havedone so,'' Fitzwater said.   In a report to Congress, the Iran-Contra prosecutor revealedthat he wrote Bush on Oct. 19, saying that the administration wasengaging in ``interference'' by invoking national security concernsin the case against a former CIA station chief, Joseph Fernandez.   ``Without your help the rule of law will be subordinated to theintelligence effort,'' wrote Walsh. ``The tail has begun to wag thedog.'' </TEXT></DOC>
