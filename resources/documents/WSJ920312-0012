However, he fails to mention the duty ofthe press to report honestly and accurately. In fact, Mr.Daremblum describes events in a misleading and insidiousmanner.   It is ludicrous to associate former Costa Rican PresidentOscar Arias with narco-related activities. Costa Rica'speople are well aware that the Arias administrationefficiently combated narco-trafficking by expanding andstrongly enforcing anti-narcotics legislation.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Daremblum suggests that Mr. Arias's appearance beforethe legislative commission investigating narco-traffickingwas an extraordinary event, when in fact appearances beforesuch commissions are common in Costa Rica's democraticsystem. The statements by Mr. Arias and Costa Rica's currentpresident, Rafael Angel Calderon, are only two of many thecommission has received since its establishment in 1988,during Mr. Arias's term in office. Moreover, anyone canobtain a detailed transcript of the proceedings.   Foreign citizens often contribute to Latin Americanpolitical activities. In fact, private contributions topolitical parties, both from national and internationalsources, are legal in Costa Rica and have always beenaccepted in good faith when no reason has existed to questionthe moral integrity of the contributor or the legality of thefunds.   In the 1985 campaign, both Messrs. Calderon and Ariasreceived financial support from foreign sources. The financecommittee of the Arias campaign was always aware that itscontributors had never faced civil or criminal charges fornarco-related activities. The legislative commissionconfirmed this fact through statements from Interpol and theU.S. Justice Department.   Mr. Daremblum once again misguides the reader when hestates that Costa Rican businessman Ricardo Alem had a&quot;worrisome background&quot; in 1985, during the Arias electoralcampaign, and in January 1987, when he was appointed adirector of the Central American Bank of EconomicIntegration's governing board. In November 1987, when theArias administration first received information that Mr. Alemwas making substantial bank deposits, it immediately demandedhis resignation. This occurred almost one year before Mr.Alem was detained by Costa Rican authorities in 1988, whilePresident Arias was still in office.   The altered videotape used in the commission's hearing,and so malignantly referred to by Mr. Daremblum to establisha supposed link between President Arias and Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, actually corresponds to Mr. Arias's March19, 1986, visit to the traditional David City Fair.President-elect Arias had been invited to this event byPanamanian President Erick Arturo del Valle, and wasaccompanied by various members of his future cabinet, electedcongressmen, Costa Rican government officials andrepresentatives of the press.   In 1986, no member of the Panamanian RevolutionaryDemocratic Party (PRD) was accused of any misconduct, and thegovernment of Panama enjoyed full international recognition.However, during the past electoral campaign of 1989-1990, theCosta Rican press widely publicized the testimony of JoseBlandon, a former Panamanian diplomat to the U.S. Mr. Blandontestified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee about the PRD'scontributions to major Costa Rican parties during the 1985campaign. Mr. Arias always admitted having received suchcontributions.   Rodrigo Madrigal Montealegre   Professor   Political Sciences Department   University of Costa Rica   San Jose, Costa Rica</TEXT></DOC>
