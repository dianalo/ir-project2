The institute said in a report the state petroleum monopoly Pemexwill have to cut down on exports and increase current provenreserves by at least 12.5 billion barrels during the next 11 yearsjust to keep up with growing domestic demand.   Mexico's total energy consumption is currently equivalent to2.325 million barrels of crude oil daily, 80 percent of which ismade up of petroleum and the rest is generated by hydroelectricplants, according to the report.   This could go up to the equivalent of 3.7 million barrels dailyby the year 2000 and to 5.9 million barrels by the year 2010, theinstitute said.   The country's proven oil reserves currently stand at about 72billion barrels of crude. It produces 2.5 million barrels daily andsells 1.325 million barrrels, mostly to the United States, making itthe world's sixth largest exporter.</TEXT></DOC>
