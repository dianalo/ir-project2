The problems at Sprint, which actually posted strongoperating profit gains for the quarter and the year,underscored the marketing advantages enjoyed by Sprint rivalsAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCI CommunicationsCorp. While those companies reported gains in traffic volumein the fourth quarter from the third, United said Sprint'straffic volume actually fell by 0.5%.</LP><TEXT>   United Telecom Chairman William Esrey said that Sprint'sfirst-quarter earnings are likely to be hurt by higherselling expenses related to new marketing programs. &quot;We'renot at all happy with our (performance) in the residentialand small business market, (where) we've been experiencingdeclining market share,&quot; he said. &quot;Investment will comefirst; the payoff comes second.&quot;   United Telecom's net income grew to $98.1 million, or 45cents a share, from $70.8 million, or 33 cents a share, inthe year-earlier period. Revenue rose 2.3% to $2.2 billionfrom $2.15 billion.   For the year, the Westwood, Kan., company's earningsclimbed 19% to $367.5 million, or $1.68 a share, from $308.7million, or $1.43 a share, in 1990. However, 1990 profit wasreduced by a charge of $72 million, or 18 cents a share.Without that charge, 1990 net would have been $380 million,or more than 3% higher than United Telecom's 1991 earnings.Revenue in 1991 increased 5.2% to $8.78 billion from $8.35billion.   At Sprint, fourth-quarter revenue was practicallyunchanged at $1.34 billion. And Sprint's $80 million inoperating profit, although better than the $51 million in1990's fourth quarter, was below the third quarter's $90million.   For the year, Sprint's operating profit almost doubled to$295 million from $148 million in 1990. But that gainreflected the $72 million charge, which if excluded would cutSprint's profit growth to 34%. Revenue rose 6.5% to $5.39billion from $5.06 billion -- or a little better than thelong-distance industry's growth rate.   &quot;We said in late 1990 that we'd shift our emphasis toimproving margins and we did that,&quot; said Mr. Esrey. &quot;You haveto look below the surface.&quot;   &quot;Sprint is dead in the water, they're just not in theballgame&quot; compared with other carriers, said Gregory Sawers,telecommunications analyst at Sanford Bernstein andamp; Co. Henoted that Sprint's rate of growth from quarter to quarterhad declined through most of 1991. That's because &quot;ATandamp;T andMCI have trained their sights on Sprint customers and Sprintis losing share,&quot; added Robert B. Morris III, an analyst atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The poor economy has &quot;exposed theirweaknesses,&quot; he said.   United Telecom's local phone business fared better.Operating profit grew 18.8% in the quarter to $164 millionwhile revenue rose 5% to $719 million. Growth in new phonelines was 3.4% for the year. Profits from United Telecom'sother businesses, including directories, rose 6.3% to $17million in the quarter while revenue fell 2.4% to $195.8million.   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, UnitedTelecom's shares were quoted at $22.75, down $1.25.</TEXT></DOC>
