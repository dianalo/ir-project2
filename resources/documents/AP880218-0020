(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Stories abound that prostitutesfrequently visit ice fishing houses on Mille Lacs Lake, where asmany as 10,000 men gather on winter weekends, but authorities saythey may just be fish stories.   ``Personally, I've never run across the hooks, but I rememberthey were supposed to be working the lake back in the '60s,'' saidJerry Anderson, a fishing guide on the large central Minnesota lakewhose shoreline includes this town.   ``At least it makes a nice story. January and February can be areal boring time of year up here,'' he said.   But Jim Forbord, a state conservation officer who has worked thelake for nine years, said he wouldn't be surprised if truth isfound in one of two theories: Prostitutes peddle their waresfishhouse door to fishhouse door, or they do business in their ownfishhouse.   ``When you check houses you run into everything under the sun,''he said. ``You don't know if they're girlfriends, boyfriends, wivesor what. Sometimes I have to let them pull on a blanket before Icome in.''   Authorities say no arrests or prosecutions on prostitutioncharges have been made in any of the three counties that includeparts of the lake.   Last fall, however, an Aitkin County sheriff's deputyinvestigated a report that two local women were operating asprostitutes on the southeast shore, said Sheriff Bill Sobey. Thereport seemed credible, but there wasn't enough evidence to make anarrest, he said.   ``I used to always figure it was just talk,'' Sobey said. ``I'venever had a fishhouse myself, so I've never had a chance to findout.''   He believes authorities would know if prostitutes were active inthe area. ``You'd hear something. People talk,'' he said.   Crow Wing County Attorney Stephen Rathke said, ``I'd heard of itfor years and I guess I've always assumed it was true because it'sso logical. You know, literally thousands of men in these littlefish houses.''   This winter, there are nearly 4,000 fish houses on the lake,giving the frozen lake a bigger population than any of the citieson its shore.   ``You've got to realize you get a real rowdy crew out there,''said Anderson. ``There's gambling, seeing who can drink the most.Maybe that's how the stories start.''   Forbord has his own theory about the stories: ``Fishermen liketo talk a pretty good brag. When you spend all weekend staring at abobber, you start thinking about something else to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
