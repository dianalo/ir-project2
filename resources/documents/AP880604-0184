The Mail on Sunday said the hostages, including nine Americansand three Britons, were taken there during recent fighting in thearea between gunmen of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization andShiite Amal militiamen.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed holding the captives.   The Mail on Sunday attributed its report to Amal officers it didnot identify.   In other developments:   _ London's Guardian newspaper said the United States is holdingtalks with Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and directly with Iranianrepresentatives in Geneva in another effort to gain the release ofthe hostages. It based its report on information from unidentifiedpolitical sources in Beirut.   _ The British Foreign Office said Saturday it has proposed payingIran the equivalent of more than $3.2 million as compensation in asettlement over damages to British diplomatic buildings in Iran andIran's Embassy in London.   A Foreign Office spokesman, who was not identified in line withgovernment practice, said the proposal is to be discussed at ameeting in London starting Wednesday but the talks will not coverthe question of the British hostages in Lebanon.   Of the nine American captives, Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, has been held the longest.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Many previous published reports on where the hostages were beingheld and about talks to gain their release turned out to beunfounded.   The Mail on Sunday said the captives are being guarded at theschool by high ranking Hezbollah officers supervised by IranianRevolutionary Guards.   It said Amal militiamen have infiltrated Hezbollah and quoted oneAmal fighter as describing the school where it said the hostages areheld.   The newspaper said militiaman Abu Abass was interrogated byHezbollah members at the building, the former Azariyeh primaryschool.   Reporters in Beirut said they knew of an Azariyeh primary schoollocated in the southern suburbs of Beirut but they did not how it isbeing used.   The newspaper quoted Abass as saying, ``The tunnels andpassageways have recently been excavated and a ventilation systemhas been installed. The whole area has been partitioned into tinycells.''   Abass also said a doctor occasionally goes to the school,accompanied by guards.   The Mail on Sunday quoted other Amal officers as saying: ``Weknow they (the hostages) are there and that they are alive. But anyattempt to take them by force will only result in bloodshed.''   The dim front-page photo showed what appeared to be part of aone-story building with sandbags at strategic points.   In its article, the Guardian said the purported talks in Lebanonand Geneva were not expected to produce quick results for theAmerican hostages, but to ``accelerate'' as the Americanpresidential elections approach in November.   It said the United States is thought to be seeking a ``packagedeal'' that also would involve Church of England envoy Terry Waitewho was in Lebanon trying to arrange the release of the foreignhostages when he disappeared on Jan. 20, 1987.   The Foreign Office spokesman said the British proposal onsettlement of damages to diplomatic buildings was first made in May1987. Britain has said repeatedly that it will make no deals to gainthe release of the hostages.   The spokesman said the Iranian representatives at Wednesday'smeeting will only be considering the questions of damage to Iran'sEmbassy at London's Princes Gate, which caught fire when Britishcommandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege, and damage toBritish diplomatic offices in Tehran and elsewhere in Iran.   British government buildings and the British Embassy were damagedby mobs in 1978, 1979, and 1980.   ``We want compensation for the damage to our property in Iran andwe want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the PrincesGate property, which is a health hazard and an eyesore,'' thespokesman said.   He said under the proposal, Britain would pay Iran about 1.8million pounds ($3.24 million) and Iran would pay Britain aboutabout 900,000 pounds ($1.62 million).   A series of diplomatic explusions has left just one Britishofficial in Tehran and one Iranian official in London.</TEXT></DOC>
