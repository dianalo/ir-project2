So now what?   Many Wall Street analysts believe that the trend towardlower interest rates will continue. And for the bond market,that means the party isn't over just yet.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There is no reason in the world why bond yields can't golower&quot; and prices higher, said Donald Fine, chief marketanalyst at Chase Securities Inc., a unit of Chase ManhattanBank. &quot;Bond yields may not go down in a straight line, butthere will be continued improvement.&quot;   Like many analysts, Mr. Fine notes that the economy isgrowing very slowly, money-supply growth is slipping andinflation doesn't appear threatening -- factors that justifyfurther reductions in interest rates.   On Friday, the Federal Reserve lowered the discount rate,the rate at which the Fed lends to financial institutions, by1/2 percentage point to 5%, the lowest level since February1973. The Fed also cut the federal funds rate, the rate whichbanks charge each other for overnight loans, by 1/4percentage point to 5 1/4%. By reducing the key rates, theFed is trying to stimulate business activity and assure thatthe economy does not fall back into a recession.   In response to the Fed's move, major commercial bankslowered their prime lending rate 1/2 percentage point to 8%.Bond yields declined on Thursday in anticipation of the Fed'smove, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond decliningto 7.92%, the lowest level in nearly two years. Althoughyields on the benchmark bond rose slightly to 7.93% onFriday, traders said the reversal was due to profit-taking.Sentiment, they said, remains extraordinarily bullish.   Many economists on Wall Street believe it will take evenlower long-term rates to get the economy back on solidfooting. They point out that while short-term interest rateshave fallen sharply, long-term rates have not. The federalfunds rate, for example, is now two percentage points lowerthan where it stood at the start of the year. But the yieldon the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond is just 1/4 percentagepoint lower than in early January. And movements in long-termrates such as mortgages and some corporate lending rates,which are influenced by long-term Treasury yields, have moreeffect on the economy than do short-term rates.   The latest cut in the discount and federal funds rateswill not &quot;provide much immediate relief for the Americaneconomy,&quot; said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody'sInvestors Service Inc., the credit rating concern thatmonitors corporate credit quality. &quot;Many companies arestruggling with an unexpected slowdown in sales that shouldsignificantly depress third-quarter profits,&quot; he said.   Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial marketsresearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Inc., also has anegative outlook for the economy. &quot;The risk of a double-diprecession has increased enormously,&quot; he said. &quot;I expect theFed to deal with this weakness by lowering interest ratesfurther to encourage capital investment and {stimulate} thehousing sector,&quot; he said. (A double dip recession occurs whenthe economy briefly climbs out of recession but then fallsback again.)   That's the kind of gloomy talk that inspires bondinvestors. As long as inflation remains under control, a weakeconomy and lower interest rates are bullish for bonds.   &quot;The bond rally is far from over,&quot; said Philip Braverman,senior vice president at DKB Securities Corp., a unit ofDai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. &quot;Expect bond yields to reach 7 1/2%to 7 3/4% over the near term, and 7% or below over the nexttwelve months,&quot; he said.   To profit from this expected trend, many analystsrecommend that investors extend out on the yield curve bybuying intermediate-term and long-term bonds. Thesesecurities, which mature in five years or longer, have muchhigher yields than short-term securities and offer thepotential of strong price appreciation if the bond rallypicks up steam. Many analysts seem to prefer seven-yearTreasury notes, which they said should provide the bestperformance in the weeks ahead.   The bond market's yield curve remains very &quot;steep,&quot;meaning there is a wide spread between the yields onshort-term and long-term bonds, with yields highest on thelonger end of the curve. In the Treasury market, for example,the yields rise from 5.3% on three-month bills to 6.15% ontwo-year notes, and from 7.4% on seven-year notes to 7.9% on30-year bonds.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The Fed's move to reduce short-term interest rates igniteda strong rally during early trading. But the rally faded dueto profit-taking, causing prices to end moderately lower.   The market's bellwether security, the 8.125% 30-yearTreasury bond, ended more than 1/8-point lower, a loss ofmore than $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Theissue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of itsprice, rose to 7.93% from 7.92% on Thursday. The price of thebenchmark bond was quoted late Friday at 102 1/32, comparedwith 102 7/32 late Thursday.   In early trading, bond prices rose as much as 1/4 pointafter the government reported that retail sales fell 0.7% inAugust, a sharper decline than many economists expected.   In a separate report, the Labor Department said theconsumer price index rose 0.2% in August, less than expected.However, the index excluding food and energy was up 0.4%. Thestronger-than-expected showing in the &quot;core&quot; index causedmarket participants to flinch, but closer examinationrelieved some of that anxiety.   The 1.2% rise in apparel, which contributed 0.1 percentagepoint to the core increase, was largely due to the earlyintroduction of fall and winter clothing lines, a phenomenonthat the seasonal adjustment factors don't adequately accountfor.   In addition, the 1.2% rise in tuition costs was taken as asign of a weak economy because it means that stateuniversities, strapped for cash because of budget cuts, arebeing forced to raise tuition fees.   Profit-taking kicked in a few hours after the economicdata were released and gained momentum later in the morning.   In the corporate bond market, Viacom International Inc.became the latest company to take to the junk-bond marketwhen it offered $200 million of high-risk, high-yield bonds.The 10-year senior subordinated notes were priced at par toyield 10.25% through underwriters at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. AGoldman spokesman said that the Viacom deal wasoversubscribed.   Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. underwrote $347 millionof debt that was backed by student loans. The firm said thetransaction was the first asset-backed offering to usestudent loans as collateral.</TEXT></DOC>
