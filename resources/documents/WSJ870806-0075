Administration officials say they will talk less about what they are doing militarily and let European and Arab friends take more responsibility for diplomatic initiatives aimed at ending the Iran-Iraq war. They are taking the lower-key approach because of growing worries about Iranian-sponsored terrorism and concerns that Tehran will reject any diplomatic solution that is too closely connected to Washington. They also hope the recent Iranian-inspired riots in Mecca will rally the Arab world to take a stronger stand against Tehran.    &quot;Without a strong push from the U.S., we didn't think things would get done, but now we think that it isn't necessary to have quite so high a profile,&quot; said an administration official. &quot;We want to reduce our exposure.&quot;    This official believes that due to the Iraqi strike on the USS Stark, the growing congressional debate and concentration by the news media on U.S. military moves in the region, Washington's involvement in the Persian Gulf has attracted too much attention. He said the U.S. has therefore put Iran in a position where it has to strike at the U.S. as a matter of national prestige.    Administration officials are concerned by intelligence reports that suggest Iran is thinking about organizing terrorist strikes against American, West European and Arab targets. The administration has alerted embassies and military bases of an increased threat. Administration officials say intelligence also shows that Iran has laid the groundwork for terrorism in the U.S.    Although officials won't provide details, they say some inconclusive intelligence even points to growing collaboration between Iran and Libya in terrorist planning.    The U.S. may have difficulty lowering the profile of its Persian Gulf flotilla. The Navy is busy augmenting its forces to cope with a heavier Iranian threat than it expected.    In addition to stepped-up efforts against mines, the Navy is sending special warfare teams to join the crews of oil tankers in case Iranian terrorists try to board the vessels. Meanwhile, specially equipped helicopters will routinely accompany convoys to protect against any explosive-laden speedboats skimming their way toward any U.S.-flag vessels.    But while the Gulf force itself is growing, the U.S. is becoming more secretive about its movements. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger emphasized this week that the U.S. would operate its convoys on an unannounced schedule, in which any delays can't be interpreted as Iranian victories.    Yet the Iranians almost appear to be goading the U.S. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mohzen Rezaie, commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, as saying anti-ship and antiaircraft missiles were ready for use against any target in the Persian Gulf. He said the Silkworm anti-ship missiles would be locked on targets but wouldn't be fired &quot;except for an untoward incident instigated by an enemy,&quot; according to the news agency.    A State Department official said the Iranian announcement is part of a propaganda effort to show America &quot;is impotent in the face of Iranian threats.&quot; He said that if the missiles are &quot;locked on&quot; targets -- the electronic step that proceeds firing -- American ships will first warn the Iranians, then fire if no action is taken to &quot;lock off&quot; the missiles.    In the hope of reducing the threat of Iranian attack, the administration continues to lobby Iraq to maintain its undeclared cease-fire in the Gulf tanker war. Iran has said it would strike only if provoked by Iraq. </TEXT></DOC>
