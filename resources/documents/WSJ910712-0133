Some years ago the late Reagan-era CIA director turned upto give an exclusive to Bob Woodward. This followed a 1980sighting in Europe, where he is said to have persuadedIranians to delay freeing the hostages and so defeat JimmyCarter.</LP><TEXT>   His next other-worldly appearance was supposed to comeMonday, with the Senate intelligence committee trying to holdRobert Gates, President Bush's nominee as CIA director andMr. Casey's former CIA deputy, responsible for the secretsMr. Casey took to his grave. But politics has delayed thehearing, so he could haunt Washington all summer. Mr. Gatesmay see his nomination reduced to a Senate remake of &quot;Nightof the Living Dead.&quot;   If this seems too mocking, consider Congress's poltergeistpolitics: Instead of looking at the intelligence failures ofthe present, it prefers to stir up the Iran-Contra past.Instead of asking why the CIA pooh-poohed Saddam Hussein'snuclear capabilities only a year ago, Democrats and even someRepublicans want to follow independent counsel LawrenceWalsh's trail of CIA &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Who says Washington isn'tafraid of ghosts?   Certainly the Senate intelligence committee seems afraid;it even jumps at shadows. Mr. Walsh has cast another one bygetting a former CIA operative, Alan Fiers, to cop a plea inreturn for cooperating. Mr. Fiers is said by Mr. Walsh'sleakers to implicate higher-ups in a &quot;cover-up.&quot; This meansthey may have lied to Congress. These CIA men in turn mightor might not have told Mr. Gates about Iran-Contra, thoughMr. Gates has said he was out of the loop.   The senators, fearful of being blamed for missing somedetail, have decided they can't move without first&quot;answering&quot; all questions. This could mean waiting untilSeptember. Mr. Gates would face a Hobson's choice: He couldwithdraw. Or for two months he could twist slowly, slowly inthe breeze of accusation blowing from Judge Walsh, who isdesperately trying to revive his reputation after some fiveyears and $35 million of fruitless investigation. Thus does aspecial prosecutor, accountable to nothing but hisconscience, damage an elected president and throw a wrench indemocracy's gears.   Mr. Gates deserves better, because there is no publicevidence he ever knew about Ollie North's far-flungoperations. Mr. Gates stands accused, instead, of a sin ofomission: He somehow should have known more, and should haveacted upon the hints and snippets he did hear.   This is a novel standard of accountability, and one thatclearly doesn't apply to Congress. Surely Rep. Lee Hamilton,House intelligence committee chairman in that era, had alsoheard rumors about Ollie and the Contras? Should he too havedone more? Is every CIA officer supposed to gamble his careeron whistleblowing to Congress, no matter how sketchy hisknowledge?   Oklahoma Democrat David Boren is a fair-minded chairmanwho respects Mr. Gates and doesn't want a partisan fight.That isn't true of everyone. Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaumis a notorious political spear-thrower. More surprising isthe evident hostility of Bill Bradley, the New Jerseyliberal.   A couple of years ago Mr. Bradley tried to wrest theintelligence chair from Mr. Boren, who had to call in GeorgiaSen. Sam Nunn's big artillery to prevail. Mr. Bradley takes amore aggressive view of congressional intelligence oversight,and Mr. Gates is known to believe his primary allegiance isto the executive. Mr. Bradley made his point in a 1987hearing:                                                                                                          Mr. Gates: I do not believe there are any {intelligence}findings that we do not have or that are not in thepossession of this committee.   Sen. Bradley: As director of central intelligence, whatwould you do if you found one?   Mr. Gates: Well, the first thing I would do would be tohop in the car and come up here.   Sen. Bradley: Well, you're learning, Mr. Gates.                                                                                                          If Mr. Bradley ever realizes his presidential ambitions,he may regret helping to make Congress a co-manager of U.S.intelligence policy.   It's not as if there aren't enough other intelligenceissues to ask Mr. Gates about. Why did it take the U.S. somefive years to discover that China is helping Algeria build anuclear reactor? In a future of proliferating weapons, thiscould be a catastrophic oversight. Or where was the CIAduring the 1980s as a money-laundering bank, thesoon-to-be-notorious Bank of Credit and CommerceInternational, bought political influence in Washington?   Mr. Gates is as well qualified as anyone to adapt U.S.spookdom to these new demands. He's used intelligence as apolicy maker. He's analyzed it for 20 years at CIA. He's abureaucratic survivor, but he's shown independence, onceinducing former secretary of state George Shultz to demandthat Ronald Reagan fire him.   But such things are not as glamorous as ghosts andconspiracies. They will not attract TV cameras. They will notexpose a popular president to weeks of sniping, inflict apolitical defeat by toppling his nominee, or enhancecongressional power. Most Americans may be bored to tearswith Iran-Contra, but Washington remains fascinated by thepower of the dead.</TEXT></DOC>
