it sells for $100, featuresinstant self- configuration, and supports EMS 4.0 or 3.2 and all MS-DOS kit.andM;-  o  -andM;Xerox Corp demonstrated a Presentation Manager version of theandM;Ventura Publisher desktop publishing system at the Comdex/Spring show.andM;-  o  -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co has announced ME10d, a high-end softwareandM;package for mechanical design and drafting that runs on IBM and Compaqpersonal computers, in addition to its own HP Vectra PC, the first time thatHewlett has offered its CAD software on competitive hardware and through itsUS dealer network - and McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing andamp; Engineering SystemsCo, St Louis, is to be a value-added reseller of Hewlett's electroniccomputer-aided engineering and design software; ME10d is a full- functionMS-DOS version of the company's Unix software, which has been sold on HP9000industrial workstations since 1985; the MS- DOS version costs $6,500.andM;-  o  -andM;And Hewlett-Packard Ltd has launched an interface kit, ModelandM;17305A, which will enable the HP PaintJet printer to work withQuickDraw-based Apple Computer Macintosh software: when teamed with theinterface the printer can support 256 colours on the Macintosh II and eightcolours on the Macintosh SE and Plus; the kit consists of operating diskswhich contain a driver and fonts, and the former converts QuickDraw commandsto Hewlett Packard's printer-control language - the interface will cost #97while the PaintJet printer costs #1,000.andM;-  o  -andM;Eastman Kodak Co has launched the 150 plus enhanced version of itsandM;portable printer, with improved quality for text and graphics, 20% fasteroutput and the ability to print on plain paper: the battery-powered ink-jetprinter weighs 3.1 lbs excluding batteries and measures 2&quot; high by 6.5&quot; deepby 10.8&quot; wide - roughly the size of a standard office dictionary, and handlessingle-sheet paper or continuous-feed computer paper at up to 180 chps indraft mode; available next month, it is $500 with serial interface, $520parallel interface.andM;-  o  -andM;Vision Computer Products Ltd of Reading, Berkshire has entered theandM;end-user market with three versions of its Vision SQ range which has 44Mb ofremovable storage as well as a 40Mb hard-disk drive: the three versions arethe SQ-286/10 with 640K RAM, the SQ-286/20 with 2M RAM and the SQ-386/16 alsowith 2M RAM - the SQ-286/10 costs #2,700 and the SQ-286/20 and SQ-386/10 cost#3,275 and #3,600.andM;-  o  -andM;Cadnetix Inc is touting a lower cost version of its Sun-3/60 basedandM;CDX-56000SP printed circuit board layout workstation, previously offered onlywith the Cadnetix Graphics Accelerator: the CDX-5600 PCB CAD workstation has4Mb memory, 141Mb disk, and can be upgraded to the CDX-56000SP - no prices.andM;-  o  -andM;L M Ericsson Telefon AB has orders totalling $2.2m for cellularandM;radio equipment in Illinois and Indiana and describes them as another step inits continuing efforts to create a regional network in the Great Lakes area:in Indiana, it installed systems in South Bend and Elkhart for CenturyCommunications Corp, and in Illinois, has cut in a system for CrowleyCellular Development Corp, based in Bloomington.andM;-  o  -andM;The Santa Cruz Operation Inc has delayed the release of its latestandM;version of Unix until June: SCO Unix (previously Xenix) Release 3.2 has beenon beta test since February, and was due for general release in March - thedelay is said to be due to additional testing of the new features, whichinclude full compliance with the Posix standard, and C2 security features.andM;-  o  -andM;Meanwhile ATandamp;T Co says it has kept its promise to release earlyandM;code of Unix System 4.0 to members of  Unix International Inc by March 31.andM;-  o  -andM;Ahead of Hewlett-Packard's proposed acquisition of Apollo ComputerandM;Inc, Apollo is estimated to have 84,000, workstations installed, Hewlett49,025, so the two together would have 133,000 - still behind SunMicrosystems's estimated 150,000.andM;-  o  -andM;Electronic Data Systems Corp came away from the Fairfax CountandM;Court in Virginia very happy last week after it was granted a permanentinjunction against Ross Perot, its founder and former chairman, and to drivehome the point, said it intended to pursue further legal action against someformer EDS executives who left the company to join Perot's new firm: theinjunction prevents Perot from engaging in, or even &quot;contemplating&quot; anyfor-profit business before December 1 this year, enjoins him from&quot;soliciting, negotiating for, entering into, or performing any contract orother business relationship&quot; before that dat that &quot;contemplates or calls forany profitable return at any point in time,&quot; and also entered a finaljudgement rejecting Perot's contention that he had special rights to hire EDSemployees indefinitely - he may only hire those who were working for EDSbefore December 1 1986, and may hire no-one after December 1 1991; thequestion of whether Perot has violated an earlier court order not to competeexcept on a not-for-profit basis will be decided later.andM;-  o  -andM;Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, BMW, is to buy $150m-a-year, 1,150andM;employee Kontron Elektronik GmbH of Eching, Munich from F Hoffman-La Roche andamp;Co, on undisclosed terms.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM Espana is to invest $21.3m in adapting the infrastructure atandM;its Valencia plant to take on production of the 9370 processor: training ofstaff is already well under way and the Spanish plant will take over totalproduction from the Italian Santa Palomba plant (CI No 1,126) in June; whenthe 9370 production is ramped up, the factory at Valencia will supply theentire European market with two of the company's three 370-architecturemainframe lines - the 4381 and 9370.andM;-  o  -andM;Siemens AG last week tried to allay fears that Plessey Co Plc'sandM;chip business would become no more than a branch office of its own merchantsemiconductor business - but all the quotations reported in the FinancialTimes left the opposite impression to the one intended, implying that most ofthe innovative work that Plessey has done over the past three or four years -that led to contracts such as the one for the applications-specific chips forATE Corp's wristwatch data receivers - will be abandoned and that thebusiness will narrowly focus on the needs of GEC and Siemens for customcircuits, that applications-specific circuits only &quot;might&quot; continue to bePlessey's main province, and that its pioneering work on Gallium Arsenide -and the new plant in Devon, might be abandoned.andM;-  o  -andM;IBM will now bundle Above Software Inc's Above Disc software withandM;with every AT extended memory board it sells in Europe, and will recommendand promote Above Disc to dealers.andM;-  o  -andM;Expanding on GEC Plc's arrangements with General Electric Co (CIandM;No 1,156), the evident difficulty that most would-be partner companies havein reaching definitive agreement with GEC mean that the ventures are lesscomprehensive than those envisaged in the original announcement at the end oflast year - in particular, the 25%-75% joint venture on medical electronicsin Europe is abandoned, and GE simply buys GEC's UK sales and service networkfor X-ray, nuclear magnetic resonance and other medical products, which hasannual sales of about #20m; GE's European appliance business is not now goinginto the 50-50 electrical appliances joint venture, for which GE pays GEC#325m; and GE is taking only a 10% stake in the GEC-CGE-Alsthom joint ventureand will not now put its turbine technology into the firm; the GEC electricalplugs and switches business in Belgium and GE's similar business in Italywill be merged as was originally planned.andM;-  o  -andM;In the context of the experimental machine Intel Corp has beenandM;commissioned to build out of thousands of 80860 chips with a designperformance of 128GFLOPS, a battlefield analogy can clarify the differencebetween such a machine and Cray Research Inc's forthcoming Cray-3: you canwire together a dozen mines in a flowerbed in your back garden, set them alloff and you'll get a loud bang and a shower of earth; you can seed the wholeof the back garden with mines, trigger them all off together and you'll get avery loud bang indeed, and bury the all neighbours' gardens with earth - butyou still won't have created even the tiniest nuclear weapon.andM;-  o  -andM;PacifiCorp Capital Inc's government contracting unit in Reston,andM;Virginia is protesting to the General Services Administration Board ofContract Appeals a tender put out by the Navy Post- graduate School inMonterey, California for two mainframes worth $12m to $14m on the groundsthat the tender was drafted so that only IBM could win the contract, and thatthe school had received, and been rapped for soliciting, a $4,000 donationfrom IBM.andM;-  o  -andM;Cray Research Inc has a $24.9m order from Electricite de FranceandM;for a Cray Y-MP8-432 system and a Cray Y-MP4-232 system, for installation ata research base in Clamart, France in the fourth quarter replacing anX-MP-216 and a X-MP-28andM;-  o  -andM;Xerox Corp has teamed with Novell Inc to introduce a cheaperandM;configuration for network users of the Xerox Ventura Publisher family byintegrating the thing with Novell's NetWare, and the two will explore otheropportunities for co-operation; Xerox also unveiled Ventura Publisher:2.03-Pak Net Workstation, three serial-numbered 2.0 base product boot disks at$1,000, reduc-ing the per-workstation cost by $1,700 over the threeindividual copies of Ventura - from end-April.andM;-  o  -andM;NCR Ltd is terribly proud of its new automatic teller machinesandM;with colour graphics screens - 5070 lobby, 5084 through-the-wall and 5085full-function - made in Dundee and have found favour ;with the ClydesdaleBank: what would anyone want colour for?
