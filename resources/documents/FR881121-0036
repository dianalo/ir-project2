Testing under these rules must beconducted prior to employment/use, periodically, based on reasonable cause,and random selection and is the responsibility of motor carriers. Post-accidenttesting must also be performed and is the responsibility of the driver.Generally, drivers of commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weightrating (GVWR) over 26,000 pounds, vehicles transporting hazardous materialswhich require to be placarded, and certain buses are covered by this rule.The overall goal of testing is to ensure a drug-free transportation environmentwhich, in turn, would reduce accidents and casualties in motor carrieroperations. This rule is necessary to prohibit a driver from driving whilethat driver has a prohibited drug in his or her system or if that driverhas used drugs as evidenced by a drug test showing the presence of drugsor drug metabolites. The rule is intended to ensure a drug-free motor carrierworkforce and to eliminate drug use and abuse in the motor carrier industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Effective Date: This final rule is effective on December21, 1988.The drug testing requirements must be in place no later than December 21,1989, for motor carriers with 50 or more ``drivers subject to testing.''By December 21, 1990, all other motor carriers and drivers must be includedin a drug test program which meets this rule. ``Drivers subject to testing''is defined as: (1) employee drivers, and (2) contract drivers under contractfor a total of 90 days or more in any 365-day period. Only the ``driverssubject to testing'' are required to be tested under a program implementedby large motor carriers by December 21, 1989.

These questionswere: 1. Should the FHWA mandate urine drug screening (preemployment and biennial)for all interstate commerce drivers?2. Should the FHWA only state it permits urine drug screening in the regulation,leaving the decision to the motor carrier and the examining physician whetherto perform the test?3. Whether urine drug screening is mandated or optional, should the urinedrug screening, where positive, be automatically subjected to more specificand sensitive tests for further confirmation?4. Should the list of prohibited drugs, as now named, be changed to prohibituse of all drugs in the Schedules of Controlled Substances (SCS), SchedulesI through V, 21 CFR Part 1308? If the SCS is adopted in its entirety, shoulda provision be added that specifically addresses instances of drivers usingSCS drugs under doctor's orders? The FHWA also published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) (BMCS DocketNo. MC-120, Notice No. 86-3; 51 FR 17572) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on the same date as the ANPRM (May 13, 1986).The NPRM sought comments on the qualification and disqualification of drivers,background investigation and inquiries into the drivers' driving records,written examinations, and road tests. With regard to the qualificationof drivers, the NPRM sought comments on a proposal to amend the FederalMotor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to include a drug testing, standardfor drivers of certain hazardous materials-laden vehicles. Comments werealso sought on whether the proposed drug testing plan should mandated orbe a recommended industry practice. On June 14, 1988, the FHWA published, in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> an NPRM proposing drug testing for commercialmotor vehicle drivers who operate in interstate commerce (53 FR 22268).This NPRM addresed the issues contained in both earlier rulemaking actions.The FHWA also held a series of public hearings on the proposed regulations.These hearings were held on July 12, 1988, in Cleveland, Ohio; July 25,1988, in Dallas, Texas; August 4, 1988, in Los Angeles, California; andAugust 9, 1988, in Washington, D.C. The proceedings of all the hearingswere recorded by a court reporter. The transcript of each hearing and anystatements or other material submitted to the hearing panel during thehearings have been placed in the public docket. This material also hasbeen carefully reviewed during the development of this final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Current Rules</ITAG>The FHWA has a very strong anti-drug program in place to combat drug use,primarily drug-related impairment while driving, in the motor carrier industry.The following is a description of current rules pertaining to the use ofdrugs by drivers of commercial motor vehicles being operated in interstatecommerce.Under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, 49 U.S.C. App. 2707,the FHWA has established a regulation to disqualify drivers who operatemotor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. (<T4>Federal Register </T4>Volume 53, No. 140, July 21, 1988) These Federaldisqualifications apply to intrastate drivers, as well as those operatingvehicles in interstate commerce. The regulation disqualifies a driver for1 year from driving a commercial motor vehicle in intrastate or interstatecommerce if found to have committed a first violation of driving a commercialmotor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.If such a driver was transporting hazardous materials cargo, the disqualificationperiod is 3 years. A second offense will result in a lifetime ban fromdriving a commercial motor vehicle unless the Secretary, by regulation,reduces the penalty to no less than 10 years.Also, under subtitle T of title I of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-570, section 1971, 100 Stat. 3207-59), it is a Federal crime forthe operator of a common carrier (i.e., rail carrier, a sleeping car carrier,a bus transporting passengers in interstate commerce, a water common carrier,an air common carrier) to operate under the influence of alcohol or a controlledsubstance. The maximum penalties, upon conviction, are 5 years imprisonmentand a $10,000 fine. This Federal law is codified at 18 U.S.C.A. section342 (West Supp. 1987).The FHWA has adopted regulations which prohibit the use, by a driver, ofa Schedule I drug or other substance, an amphetamine, a narcotic, or anyother habit-forming drug (49 CFR 391.41(b)(12) (1987)). A driver who usessuch a drug is not qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle in interstatecommerce (49 CFR 391.11(b)(6)(1987)). Unqualified persons who operate incommercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce are subject to civil andcriminal penalties (49 U.S.C. 521(b) (1982 andamp; Supp. III 1985)).The FHWA has issued specific regulations prohibiting the operation of acommercial motor vehicle when drugs are involved. This rule provides thatno driver shall be on duty and possess, be under the influence of, or usea Schedule I drug or other substance, an amphetamine, a narcotic, or anyother substance, to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safelyoperating a commercial motor vehicle (49 CFR 392.4(a) (1987)). This provisiondoes not apply to the possession or use of a drug administered by or underthe instructions of a physician who has advised the driver that the drugwill not affect the driver's ability to safely operate the vehicle (49CFR 392.4(c)). Also, this section does not prohibit the ``possession''of a drug which is manifested and transported as part of the shipment (49CFR 392.4(d)).Under 49 CFR 391.15, upon a conviction for driving under the influenceof a prohibited drug, the driver is disqualified for at least 1 year andup to 3 years depending on previous convictions.On October 4, 1988, the FHWA published a final rule required by the CommercialMotor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 pertaining to alcohol use by commercialdrivers. That rule which became effective October 27, 1988, reduces theblood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a driver canbe disqualified for operating a commercial motor vheicle under the influenceof alcohol. The rule establishes 0.04 percent as the BAC level to be used.States will be required to adopt and enforce this BAC level in order tocomply with the provision of the 1986 Act in order to avoid the loss ofFederal-Aid Highway funds. The disqualification provisions are enforceablefrom a Federal perspective effective October 27, 1988.This final drug testing rule complements these rules by requiring drugtesting by certain motor carriers. The existing rules generally addressimpairment due to drug use and resulting possible disqualification. Thisfinal rule generally addresses drug use and the determination that a driveris medically unqualified to drive.<ITAG tagnum="84">Jurisdiction</ITAG>Authority pertaining to motor carrier safety has been delegated to theFHWA at 49 U.S.C. 104 (1982 and Supp. III 1985) and 49 CFR 1.48 (1986).Under 49 U.S.C. 3102 (1982 andamp; Supp. III 1985), the FHWA may prescriberequirements for the qualifications and maximum hours of service of employeesand the safety of operation and equipment of motor carriers. For purposesof this section, motor carriers include for-hire motor carriers of passengersor property and private motor carriers of property operating in interstatecommerce. Motor vehicles subject to this regulatory authority are not limitedby size or weight. Under this authority, the FHWA has established the FMCSRs,49 CFR Parts 350-399.Section 206 of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (Act), 49 App. U.S.C.2505 (Supp. III 1985), directs that Federal safety standards be establishedfor motor vehicles that, at a minimum, ensure that_(a) Commercial motor vehicles are safely maintained, equipped, loaded,and operated;(b) The responsibilities imposed upon operators of commercial motor vehiclesdo not impair their ability to operate such vehicles safely;(c) The physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles isadequate to enable them to operate such vehicles safely; and(d) The operation of commercial motor vehicles does not have deleteriouseffects on the physical condition of such operators.This regulatory authority is applicable to for-hire and private motor carriersoperating commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce. A commercialmotor vehicle is defined in the 1984 Act as a vehicle used in interstatecommerce if the vehicle_(a) Has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 or more pounds;(b) Is designed to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver;or(c) Is used to transport hazardous materials in a quantity requiring thevehicle to be placarded under the Hazardous Materials Regulations, 49 CFRParts 171-179 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="84">Policy Statement</ITAG>It is the policy of the FHWA that drivers on the highways of our Nationshould be free of drugs. To detect and deter the use of drugs by bus andtruck drivers, this rule requires motor carriers to establish a programof four types of driver testing for the use of controlled substances: Pre-employment,periodic (biennial), reasonable cause, and random testing. In addition,this rule requires drivers to ensure that they are tested for drug useafter a reportable accident. The testing procedures will protect individualprivacy, ensure accountability and integrity of specimens, require confirmationof all positive screening tests, mandate the use of laboratories operatingwithin the guidelines established by 49 CFR Part 40, provide confidentialityfor test results and medical histories, and ensure nondiscriminatory testingmethods. The FHWA proposes to require all motor carriers subject to theserules to establish effective drug use prevention programs for drivers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Goals of Testing</ITAG>The overall goal of the required testing is to ensure a drug-free transportationenvironment which, in turn, will reduce accidents and casualties in motorcarrier operations.Under this rule, a driver may not use controlled substances on or off duty.In this rule, the terms ``controlled substances'' and ``drugs'' are synonymous.If controlled substance use is detected, an individual is unqualified todrive a commercial motor vehicle involved in interstate commerce. A drivercould not be hired or used if he/she has a confirmed positive drug testas a result of a pre-employment, periodic, reasonable cause, post-accidentor random test. In all cases of a positive test, the driver is medicallyunqualified until such time as the driver no longer uses controlled substances,tests negative for controlled substances, and is medically recertified.Drug testing and sanctions for use will help discourage substance use andreduce absenteeism, accidents, health care costs, and other drug-relatedproblems. It will act as a deterrent to those individuals who might betempted to try drugs for the first time or who currently use drugs. Finally,drug testing will protect the health and safety of the employees of motorcarriers and other users of the highway system through the early identificationand referral for treatment of workers with drug use problems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>This section discusses the major comments and FHWA's response, includingrevisions to the NPRM. Generally these comments, while attributed to certaincommenters, reflect the views of many others and address the major issuesidentified by the commenters to the NPRM.The FHWA has reformatted the final rule by amending Part 391, Qualificationsof Drivers, instead of adding a new part to the FMCSRs. This is being doneto streamline the FMCSRs and to clarify that this final rule generallyapplies to driver qualifications. This change is not substantive. The subpartsincluded in the NPRM have been deleted as unnecessary and a new SubpartH, Controlled Substance Testing, has been added to Part 391. To aid thereader in understanding this change, the following chart of NPRM sectionsand corresponding final rule sections is included:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>NPRM section</H1><H1>Final rule section</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">382.101<D>391.81.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.103<D>391.83.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.105<D>391.85.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.107<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.109<D>391.87.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Not included<D>391.89.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.111<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Not included<D>391.93.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.201<D>391.95.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.203<D>391.97.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.301<D>391.113.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.303<D>391.115.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.305<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.307<D>394.7, 394.9, and 394.20.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.309<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.311<D>391.117.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.401<D>391.99.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.403<D>391.101.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.501<D>391.103.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.503<D>391.105.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.505<D>391.107.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.601<D>391.109.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.603<D>391.111.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.701<D>391.119.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.703<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.705<D>Deleted.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">382.707<D>391.121.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Not included<D>391.123.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">General Overview of Comments</ITAG>The FHWA received approximately 145 comments to the docket in responseto the NPRM. In addition, 43 persons/organizations presented testimonyat the four public hearings. During the public hearings, the Administratorof the FHWA, the hearing official for each of the hearings, requested furtherinformation from several individuals who presented statements at the hearings.The FHWA carefully considered all comments that were submitted to the docketincluding those received after September 12, 1988, the closing date ofthe comment period, as well as all testimony presented at the hearingsor submitted as requested by the Administrator at the hearings.The breakdown, by type of commenter, is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="14">Motor carriers: 42</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Farmer organizations: 7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Associations: 39</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Individuals: 28</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Governmental agencies: 8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Unions: 6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Miscellaneous: 8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Medical: 5</ITAG>Many of the associations were represented at several of the hearings andalso submitted comments to the docket and several commenters submittedmore than one comment. The majority of the individuals who testified orsubmitted comments, and who were not affiliated with an organization, werecommercial motor vehicle drivers.In general, the commenters support the FHWA's efforts to achieve a drug-freemotor carrier workforce. There were, however, many differences of opinionregarding the method of achieving that goal. The primary differences centeredaround the random testing proposal and the proposal to mandate driver rehabilitationand subsequent employment reinstatement (included in 3 of the 4 rehabilitationoptions proposed in the NPRM). To a lesser extent, the post-accident andreasonable cause testing proposals also received a substantial number ofcomments.Many of the commenters were concerned about the practical issues in implementingthe rule, such as costs, equity, participation and enforcement. Commenterswere also concerned about the legality of the proposal, especially theconstitutionality of random drug testing. The following section discusseseach of those concerns.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Issues</ITAG>Constitutional Objections to Drug TestingThe FHWA recognizes that there are legitimate and significant constitutionalconcerns surrounding drug testing in general and random drug testing asa specific component of drug testing. The FHWA acknowledges the currentwide-scale litigation and apparent disparate judicial opinions on drugtesting programs. Although the state of the case law is still evolvingin rapid fashion and the Supreme Court has not resolved many of the relevantand complex issues, the FHWA is confident that testing of employees underthis rule will withstand judicial scrutiny on constitutional grounds.Of particular concern to the commenters was the relevance of the FourthAmendment to drug testing. The principles of the Fourth Amendment to theU.S. Constitution are paramount in scrutinizing the fundamental legalityof many drug testing programs. The Fourth Amendment applies to ``searches''conducted or mandated by the government (i.e., ``State action'') and protectsindividuals against ``unreasonable searches and seizures.'' Action by aprivate party does not constitute State or Federal action unless thereexists a close nexus between the State and the action in question. <T3>See Jackson</T3> v. <T3>Metropolitan Edison</T3>, 419 U.S. 345 (1974); <T3>Moose Lodge No. 107 </T3>v. <T3>Irvis</T3>, 407 U.S. 163 (1972).Because drug testing programs required under the final rule are imposedby the government, two collateral issues arise concerning whether the proposedurine tests under these programs constitute a search or a seizure and,if so, is the search or seizure unreasonable within the meaning of theFourth Amendment. Although most courts to address the issue to date haveruled that toxicological testing of employees for the purpose of determiningfitness for duty is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,the issue is not entirely settled. <T3>See Wyman </T3>v. <T3>James,</T3> 400 U.S. 309, 317-338 (1971) (government welfare caseworker's``home visit'' as a precondition for assistance payments is not a FourthAmendment search). <T3>See also Lovvorn </T3>v. <T3>City of Chattanooga, </T3>846 F.2d 1539, 1553-54 (6th Cir. 1988) (Guy,R., dissenting) vacated and rehearing en banc Glantco (6th Cir. 1988);<T3>National Treasury Employees Union </T3>v. <T3>von Raab,</T3> 808 F.2d 1057, 1060, 1062 (5th Cir. 1987) (Higginbotham,J., concurring). Cf. <T3>Mack </T3>v. <T3>United States, F.B.I., </T3>814 F.2d 120, 125 n.2 (2d Cir. 1987).Also assuming, <T3>arguendo</T3>, that urine tests of personnel for prohibited substancesare ``searches'' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, it is clearthat while searches ordinarily must be conducted pursuant to a warrantissued on probable cause grounds, such a requirement is not always necessary.<T3>Almeida-SancheandCx.174;1z </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>413 U.S. 266, 277 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring).Where, for example, ``* * *  the burden of obtaining a warrant is likelyto frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search * * *,'' the SupremeCourt has routinely held that a warrant is not required by the Fourth Amendment(citing <T3>Camera </T3>v. <T3>Municipal Court,</T3> 387 U.S. 523, 533 (1967). <T3>See e.g., Griffin </T3>v. <T3>Wisconsin, </T3>107 S.Ct. 3163 (1987) (plurality opinion); <T3>New Jersey </T3>v. <T3>T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325, 340 (1985). The Supreme Court has likewisefound that the probable cause standard is inappropriate where it woulddefeat the purpose that the search is designed to achieve. <T3>See e.g., New Jersey </T3>v.<T3> T.L.O., </T3>469 U.S. 325, 340-342; <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Martinez-Fuerte, </T3>428 U.S. 543, 560-561 (1976) (whie some quantumof individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to constitutionalsearch or seizure[,] * * * the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreduciblerequirement of such suspicion'').Rather, ``[t]he fundamental command of the Fourth Amendment is that searchesand seizures be reasonable * * *.'' <T3>New Jersey </T3>v. <T3>T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325, 340. In determining the reasonableness ofa search, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of thefacts particular to the search while acknowledging that the test of reasonableness``* * * is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.''<T3>Bell </T3>v. <T3>Wolfish, </T3>441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In analyzing a drug testingprogram, ``* * * what is reasonable depends on the context within whicha search takes place.'' <T3>New Jersey </T3>v. <T3>T.L.O.,</T3> 469 U.S. 325, 337.In scrutinizing whether a particular search comports with the Fourth Amendment,courts have adopted a balancing test. In general, to support a claim thata search of an individual or the individual's property is reasonable, thegovernment must demonstrate that, on balance, the public's legitimate interestin conducting the search outweighs the individual's legitimate expectationof privacy. <T3>See e.g., United States </T3>v. <T3>Montoya de Hernandez,</T3> 473 U.S. 531, 537 (1985); <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Villamonte-Marquez, </T3>462 U.S. 579, 588 (1983); <T3>Delaware </T3>v. <T3>Prouse, </T3>440 U.S. 648, 654 (1979). Thus, the courts must considerthe scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted,the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.''<T3>Bell </T3>v. <T3>Wolfish,</T3> 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979).Thus far, a number of courts have held or suggested in <T3>dicta</T3> that testing upon reasonable suspicion alone may be inadequate.Reasonable suspicion testing allows inquiry only after a problem manifestsitself at work. <T3>See, Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1279 </T3>v.<T3> Cambria County Transit Authority,</T3> No. 88-796 (W.D. Pa. July 19,1988). Furthermore, these courts have allowed drug and alcohol testingin the context of a pre-employment physical or routine health examination.<T3>See, e.g., Combria County Transit Authority </T3>(drug and alcoholtesting during annual physical examinations does not violate employee rightsunder the fourth amendment; individualized reasonable suspicion not required);<T3>Wrightsell </T3>v.<T3> City of Chicago,</T3> 678 F. Supp. 727 (N.D. III. 1988) (drug testingof police officers as part of routine, reasonably required, employment-relatedmedical examination is permissible where there is clear nexus between testand employer's legitimate safety concern): <T3>McDonnell </T3>v.<T3> Hunter,</T3> 612 F. Supp. 1122, 1130 n. 6 (S.D. Iowa 1985) (FourthAmendment does not preclude taking body fluid specimen as part of pre-employmentphysical or as part of routine periodic physical examination), <T3>aff'd as modified,</T3> 809 F.2d 1302 (8th Cir. 1987); <T3>Lovvorn </T3>v.<T3> City of Chattanooga,</T3> 647 F. Supp. 875 n. 7 (E.D. Tenn 1986) (noconstitutional difficulty with regularly conducted physicals, even if theyinvolve urinalysis for drugs provided they are not used as subterfuge toconduct unreasonable search and seizure). Moreover, as the court in <T3>Cambria County Transit Authority</T3> held, such testing serves thelaudable goal of fostering a drug free and sober workforce as well as flushingout those employees with serious drug problems.  Viewed in this light, the clear public interest in assuring that commercialmotor vehicle drivers perform their duties free of prohibited substancesprovides justification for testing and its limited intrusion on privacyexpectations of these individuals. The drug problem in society in generaland the probability of drug use in the interstate trucking and bus industrieswere discussed in the preamble of the NPRM. The impairing effects of drugsand the substantial risks to public safety posed by drivers who use drugsunderlie the compelling governmental interest in the promulgate of thisrule.  It is important to note that the drug testing requirements of the finalrule are limited in scope and involve a minimal intrusion or privacy. Asthe Supreme Court has indicated, where searches are undertaken in situationswhere individualized suspicion is lacking, other safeguards must be reliedupon to ensure that the discretion of the party conducting the search isproperly defined and the scope of the search is limited. <T3>See Delaware </T3>v.<T3> Prouse,</T3> 440 U.S. 648, 654-655; <T3>New York </T3>v.<T3> Burger,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 2636 (1987). The drug testing requirementsof the final rule place significant constraints on a motor carrier's discretionin conducting drug testing. For example, the requirement for random drugtesting calls for selection of an employee to be tested in a scientificallyacceptable manner, such as by use of a computer-based random number generator.Requirements for testing based on reasonable cause or post-accident testingare also severely circumscribed in order to limit an employer's discretionin administering these tests to employees.  The actual testing procedures that each motor carrier is required to implementunder this final rule are narrowly tailored to respect a driver's reasonableexpectations of privacy. 49 CFR Part 40 governing collection of urine samples,as referenced in the final rule, are carefully designed to preserve privacywhile protecting the integrity of the sample. The final rule contains anumber of important safeguards, including privacy during collection undermost types of tests, stringent laboratory safeguards, and provisions forchallenging the test results. Other employee drug testing programs incorporatingthe collection and testing procedures of the HHS Guidelines have been upheldagainst constitutional challenge. <T3>See American Federation of Government Employees </T3>v<T3> Dole,</T3> 670 F. Supp. 445 (D.D.C. 1987), <T3>appeal filed,</T3> No. 87-5417 (D.C. Cir.

Equally significant is the fact that urine drug testing of sensitive safety-and security-related employees is to be conducted in the ``context'' ofthe employment relationship. As the Supreme Court has noted, ``[t]he operationalrealities of the workplace * * * may make <T3>some</T3> employees' expectation of privacy unreasonable.'' <T3>O'Connor </T3>v.<T3> Ortega,</T3> 107 S.Ct. 1492 (1987). This is particularly importantin circumstances where the employee works in an industry in which an employee'sactivities are subject to extensive regulation. Thus, persons who workin such ``closely regulated'' industries have a ``reduced expectation ofprivacy'' [<T3>New York </T3>v.<T3> Burger,</T3> 107 S.Ct 2636 (1987)] and, ``in effect consent[ ] tothe restrictions placed upon them.'' [<T3>Almeida-Sanchez </T3>v.<T3> United States,</T3> 413 U.S. at 271]. For these reasons, two Federalcourts of appeals have upheld urinalysis testing, in the absence of particularizedsuspicion, in industries where pervasive regulation has reduced an employee'sexpectation of privacy. <T3>See Rushton </T3>v.<T3> Nebraska Public Power Dist.,</T3> 844 F.2d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 1988)(nuclear plant operators); <T3>Shoemaker </T3>v.<T3> Handel,</T3> 795 F.2d 1136, 1142 (3rd Cir.), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 479 U.S. 986 (1986) (jockeys); <T3>Policemen's Benevolent Ass'n of New Jersey, Local 318 </T3>v.<T3> Township of Washington,</T3> 850 F.2d 133 (3d Cir. 1988) (police officers). The FHWA recognizes that a number of Federal and State courts have rejectedgovernment-mandated drug testing programs on Fourth Amendment grounds.However, even courts striking down drug testing programs have recognizedthat drug testing is appropriate in other contexts. <T3>See e.g., Lovvorn </T3>v.<T3> City of Chattanooga,</T3> 846 F.2d 1539, 1533-54 (6th Cir. 1988) (Martin,J.) vacated and regarding en banc granted (6th Cir.

Memorandum opinion at 2).  The FHWA also is aware of the recent Ninth Circuit decision that held thatthe Federal Railroad Administration's mandatory blood and urine tests aftercertain accidents, incidents, or rule violations are unconstitutional becausethe rules do not require a showing of ``particularized suspicion'' of drugor alcohol impairment prior to testing. <T3>Railway Labor Executives' Association </T3>v.<T3> Burnley,</T3> 839 F.2d 575 (9th Cir. 1988), <T3> cert. granted,</T3> 108 S.Ct 2033 (1988).

Decisions in these case may not be forthcoming untilthe Spring of 1989. Numerous commenters urge that FHWA should delay a decisionon a final drug rule until these cases are resolved. The FHWA disagrees. The DOT believes that FHWA's anti-drug program and similar drug testingregimens proposed by other administrations within the Department will beruled constitutional. The critical public safety need for properly administereddrug testing to ensure that employees in the transportation industry arefree from drugs while performing certain sensitive safety- and security-relatedfunctions outweighs the practical considerations which would delay rulemakingso that it could be tailored to any guidance that may be offered by theSupreme Court when the pending cases are ultimately decided. Such a delaywould unnecessarily defer the adoption of this important safety rule wellbeyond that needed to allow reasonable time for implementation.  Pre-Employment Testing  The majority of the commenters supported the proposal, without reservation,to require motor carriers to ensure that driver-applicants are chemicallytested for evidence of the use of controlled substances.<T3>Comment</T3>: Scope of Requirement. The National Private Trucking Association(NPTA) supports the proposed requirements for pre-employment testing bycarriers, while expressing two concerns. The first concern deals with thescope of the requirement. The NPTA contends that pre-employment testingshould be required only for those applicants the motor carrier intendsto hire. It indicates that the time and costs associated with testing everyapplicant could be immense. Under 49 CFR Part 40 all positive initial screeningswould have to be confirmed by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)test. Because the proposed rule is silent on the matter of which driverapplicants carriers must specifically test, the NPTA commented that therule should be amended for clarification purposes. The NPTA recommendsthat the final rule expressly limit its scope to those applicants the carrierintends to hire.<T3>FHWA Response</T3>: The FHWA agrees with the NPTA proposal. Accordingly,andSection; 391.103 (proposed andSection; 382.501) has been changed to be moreexplicit that only those persons the motor carrier intends to hire mustbe tested for drugs prior to driving for the motor carrier. The order inwhich drug testing is performed along with the other application proceduresis at the discretion of the motor carrier.<T3>Comment</T3>: Requiring Confirmation Tests. The second concern theNPTA has relates to the costs associated with the GC/MS testing. The NPTAis opposed to requiring a second, confirmatory test for job applicantswho test initially positive if the final rule would impose the responsibilityof paying for the confirmatory test upon the carrier. The NPTA contendsthat in the pre-employment setting, carriers should be provided with asmuch discretion as possible concerning who they want to employ. The NPTA,therefore, recommends that the proposed rule be amended to give carriersthe option of whether to obtain a confirmatory test of any driver applicantwho initially tests positive, or, in the alternative, the rule should makeclear that the determination of who bears the cost of a confirmatory testhas been left to the carrier to decide.zx<T3>FHWA Response</T3>: The FHWA recognizes that there is the possibilitythat a false positive could result from the initial, screening test. Withouta confirmatory test, the driver-applicant could be wrongfully identifiedas a drug user. The FHWA is committed to following 49 CFR Part 40, includingthe requirement that a confirmation test be performed on every positivescreen test. This requirement will ensure that persons are not wrongfullyidentified as drug users based solely on the results of the less vigorousscreen test.The FHWA is sympathetic to the concern raised by the NPTA regarding theadditional costs of the GC/MS tests if they are performed on individualswho are in fact using drugs. However, the FHWA believes the intention ofthe motor carrier to employ a person, including the performance of a drugtest, must ensure that those identified as drug users are tested throughthe most rigorous methods acceptable.The FHWA, through this rule, does not intend to dictate who a motor carriermust hire. The requirement for pre-employment drug testing is to determinewhether a person is qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle. If amotor carrier intends to hire a person to drive, the results of the screentest or subsequent confirmatory test must be negative.<T3>Comment</T3>: Pre-employment vs. Prequalification. The American TruckingAssociations (ATA) also supports the FHWA proposal for pre-employment testingof driver-applicants through analysis of a urine specimen. The ATA suggeststhat this test should be referred to in the rule as ``Prequalification''or perhaps as ``Preuse'' testing. The ATA agrees with the proposal thata driver who is regularly used by a motor carrier and has been tested negativefor drug use, could be used temporarily by another motor carrier withoutan additional drug test, provided that the driver meets the other requirementsof the FMCSRs. The ATA believes that the FHWA should recognize that motorcarriers who lease drivers take exception to the term ``pre-employmenttesting'' because drivers used by them are not actually ``employed.'' Ifthere is any indication that they treat their drivers as employees ratherthan independent contractors, they will have problems of non-compliancewith various government requirements that are applicable to use of employeesbut not to use of independent contractors.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>This requirement is intended to ensure that beforea driver is used by a motor carrier, the motor carrier assures itself thatthe driver is free from drugs. Within this context, the FHWA envisionsthat there may be many instances (e.g., a person driving for a motor carrierfor the first time) where ``pre-employment'' and ``periodic'' drug testswould be combined to determine if a person is qualified to drive. In suchsituations, the ``pre-employment'' test should be considered as the initial``periodic test.'' Therefore, the FHWA agrees with the concept as suggestedby the ATA, but to reduce confusion, has decided to retain the term ``pre-employment.''Section 391.103 (proposed andSection; 382.501) has been rewritten to clarifythat the term ``pre-employment'' testing encompasses testing of personsa motor carrier intends to hire or use. <T3>Comment: </T3>Reporting of Test Results. Greyhound Lines (Greyhound)strongly supports pre-employment testing of all applicants considered foremployment. With notice to potential applicants that they will be requiredto submit to a drug test, Greyhound is finding that 20 to 30 percent ofthe drug test requests are positive. Based upon this continuing evidence,it believes that pre-employment drug screening is essential to the driverselection process. However, Greyhound does not support the proposed requirementthat drug test results should be reported to all applicants. Greyhoundindicated that between 1987 and 1988 more than 5000 applicants nationwidewere processed. To require notification would create a significant burdenon its field organization without an identified benefit. <T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA continues to believe that in order forthese requirements to be fair to all affected parties, the results of thetest must be made available to those driver-applicants requesting the information.The FHWA has revised andSection; 391.87 (proposed andSection; 382.109) to reflectthat the motor carrier must notify drivers of the test results (eitherpositive or negative by drug) and must make this information availableto those driver applicants who request it within 60 days from the datethe driver applicant was notified of not being hired. The period of 60days was chosen as a reasonable time for the driver applicant to contactthe motor carrier. <T3>Comment:</T3> Testing by Others. Consolidated Freightways (CF) indicatesit has always supported a mandatory pre-employment testing of drivers andagrees that the testing should be part of the DOT physical examinationthat determines qualification to drive on this country's highways. Sincethe inception of CF's drug screening program in November 1985, it has testedover 8000 applicants. The percentage of positive results returned in thepre-employment testing has decreased from 9.1% in 1986 to 8.0% in 1987and to 7.6% in 1988 (through June). The Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) believes thatthe best system for testing owner-operators would be a certified testingprogram in which the owner-operator could choose to have a drug test conductedon himself/herself. The owner-operator would be issued a certificationthat he/she had completed a drug test within whatever period is required.This owner-operator could present this certification to a motor carrierwhich could then use the owner-operator without further drug testing. <T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA anticipates that such procedures as describedby the OOIDA, or modifications thereof, could be used to meet these aswell as the other testing requirements. However, the FHWA continues tobelieve that it is incumbent on the motor carrier to ensure that all driversit uses, whether they be employees or not, be free from drugs. Section391.103 (proposed andSection; 382.501) has been modified to allow drug testingprograms by entities other than those under the direct control of motorcarriers, provided the motor carrier assures itself that the program conformsto this rule. The information required to be obtained by the motor carrieris specified in andSection; 391.103 (proposed andSection; 382.501). The FHWAemphasizes that this provision does not relieve the motor carrier of anyresponsibilities under this rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Periodic Testing </ITAG>There was nearly unanimous support for the FHWA's proposal that drug testing,through the collection of a urine sample, be made a requirement of thebiennial medical examination required under 49 CFR 391.11(b)(6). Many ofthe commenters believe that periodic drug testing serves as a continuingdeterrent for those who do not use drugs and as a continuing means of detectingdrug use by casual users as well as by those who are dependent upon drugs.As motor carriers became aware of the drug abuse problem, many motor carriershave implemented drug screening programs as part of the periodic medicalexamination required by the FMCSRs. The findings of those programs confirmthe benefits of drug testing prior to using a driver and of periodic drugscreening. The ATA commented that a laboratory which performs drug screensfor several major carriers indicated that it has found that up to 5 percentof drug screens completed for reexaminations show positive for drug use.This has occurred even where carriers have given advance notice that adrug screen will be performed. This percentage of ``hits'' seems, to theATA, to justify continuation of periodic drug testing. The InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) has 4 years of experience with periodictesting under the National Master Freight Agreement. The IBT supports periodictesting and is convinced from its local unions' experiences under the NMFAthat periodic testing does pose a significant deterrent to drug use. In the preamble to the NPRM, the FHWA requested comments on whether theperiodic test should be a one-time requirement. Since the test was ``scheduled,''the effectiveness in identifying drug users was questioned. The NPTA expresseda view shared by many others that it is too early to tell whether periodictesting should ``be a part of all future drug programs, or * * * phasedout after several years when the other forms of testing are establishedand working smoothly.'' The NPTA recommends that the final rule incorporatea sunset provision of 3 to 5 years which would ensure that FHWA reconsiderthe effectiveness of, and therefore the continued need for, the periodictesting requirement. The California Highway Patrol (CHP) believes that while scheduled periodictesting may not be a significant deterrent to occasional drug use, it willidentify chronic substance abusers. The CHP also contends that periodictesting also reinforces driver awareness of the motor carriers' and thepublic's commitment to drug-free driving . CHP notes that periodic testingwould be very cost effective, since it would be administered in conjunctionwith a routine medical examination.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA agrees with the majority of comments thatperiodic drug testing should be included in the driver's biennial physical.The final rule includes an amendment to andSection; 391.41(b)(12) to requirea drug test and to establish that a driver is unqualified if testing positive.Section 391.105 (proposed as andSection; 382.503) has been revised to makeit clear that a driver is required to submit a specimen for drug testingduring the first medical examination of that driver during the calendaryear after implementation of the drug testing program. This revision alsostates that a motor carrier may discontinue periodic testing after thefirst 2 years the motor carrier has implemented its random testing programaccording to the implementation schedule, and therefore, is testing 50percent of covered employees under its random drug testing program.The FHWA is revising 49 CFR 391.41(b)(12) to indicate that the drug useprohibition included in the driver qualification criteria is to be basedin part on the testing requirements of this final rule. There is nothingto prohibit other procedures to be used to ensure that this requirementis met in addition to the requirements of this rule.Reasonable Cause TestingThe FHWA currently prohibits motor carriers from allowing a driver to operatea motor vehicle if the driver's ability or alertness is impaired as a resultof fatigue, illness, or any other cause (49 CFR 392.3). In addition, 49CFR 391.11(b)(6) prohibits a motor carrier from permitting a person todrive unless that person is qualified which includes the drug use prohibitionrequirement contained in andSection; 391.41(b)(12).<T3>Comment: </T3>Definition of ``reasonable cause''. Many of the commenterssupported the reasonable cause proposal in concept but questioned whattypes of actions constitute reasonable cause. As proposed in the NPRM,``reasonable cause'' was defined as ``the operator has violated a FederalMotor Carrier Safety Regulation or a State or local traffic law that couldreasonably lead to, or has resulted in, serious injury or death; and thatthe motor carrier believes that the actions or appearance or conduct ofthe driver on duty, as defined in andSection; 395.2 of this subchapter, areindicative of the use of a controlled substance. The conduct must be witnessedand documented by at least two employees, one of whom is in a supervisorycapacity.''The commenters contended that the definition is too restrictive and verydifficult to implement. They took exception with the portion of the definitionthat referred only to a serious violation without any observation of thedriver's behavior by the motor carrier.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA agrees and therefore has revised the definitionof ``reasonable cause'' to limit it to observable actions that indicatethe use of a controlled substance. The criterion regarding the commissionof a violation of the FMCSRs is deleted. The FHWA believes that drug useshould be identified before an action is committed that may injure someoneor damage property. Also, in many circumstances, a driver may violate theFMCSRs without representatives of the motor carrier being present, makingthe proposed definition of ``reasonable cause'' ineffective.<T3>Comment: </T3>Possible Driver Harassment. Commenters, mostly thoserepresenting drivers, including owner-operators, were concerned that therequirement for reasonable cause testing does not become a means for driverharassment or discrimination.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>Because of this concern, the regulatory languageof the definition of ``reasonable cause'' has been changed to require thatthe supervisor must receive training regarding the circumstances and evidencenecessary to make the determination. The training for supervisors is tobe an element of the motor carrier's anti-drug program. The definitionhas been further changed to specify that the written documentation shallbe signed and produced within 24 hours or before the results of the testsare released, whichever is the earlier.In response to the comments raised about the problems regarding the availabilityof two persons to make a determination that a person should be tested forreasonable cause, the FHWA has revised the final rule. A motor carriermay initiate reasonable cause testing based on the observation and documentationof two supervisors or company officials trained in the detection of druguse symptoms if available. If only one supervisor is available only onemay be used.The FWHA believes that these provisions are adequate to ensure that therequirement for reasonable cause testing is not used for driver harassment.Post-accident TestingPost-accident testing is considered to be a necessary part of a drug preventionprogram. In addition, the test results will provide a valuable source ofinformation about the relationship of controlled substance use and motorcarrier accidents. Such data will be useful in identifying problems andestablishing effective countermeasures.The FHWA originally proposed mandatory testing for operators of commercialmotor vehicles involved in fatal accidents. Commenters raised several areasof concern. One concern was that only motor carrier drivers would be tested,although it is probably more likely that drivers of other vehicles, especiallyprivate automobiles and light trucks, might be impaired by drugs. Testingonly the motor carrier driver would be inequitable.Another concern raised was that motor carrier drivers might be tested inaccidents in which there is no evidence of their negligence. Without suchevidence, many commenters stated such a requirement would be an infringementon the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution regarding unreasonable searchand seizure.The National Transportation Safety Board strongly supported the post-accidenttesting proposal and recommended that alcohol be included. It further recommendedthat the time limit for the collection of a sample be set at a maximumof four hours, not the 12 hours as proposed in the NPRM. Other commentersalso supported the post accident testing requirement but with some of theconcerns noted earlier.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA agrees that other drivers involved inan accident might fail drug tests, but the FHWA does not have jurisdictionto require them to be tested. The FHWA, however, will work with the States,particularly the State enforcement agencies involved in the Motor CarrierSafety Assistance Program (MCSAP), to encourage the testing of all driversinvolved in an accident with a commercial motor vehicle where drugs aresuspected.While the FHWA believes that these concerns have merit, they should notbe used as a reason for eliminating the requirement for drug testing ofcommercial motor vehicle drivers after a reportable accident. The FHWAdoes recognize the logistical problems raised by several commenters regardingthe notification of motor carriers of an accident which, under the NPRM,would require a drug test.Therefore, the FHWA is requiring that the driver be responsible for ensuringthat a urine sample is taken, a drug test performed in accordance with49 CFR Part 40, and that the results be reported to the motor carrier afterall reportable accidents involving the driver. The FHWA believes that thedriver is in the best possible position to ensure that a drug test is performed.The requirement to accomplish this should not depend upon whether the local/Statepolicy agency or others request that such a specimen shall be provided.If the driver is too seriously injured to provide a urine specimen, therules shall require that the individual provide the necessary authorizationfor the obtaining of hospital reports or other documents that would indicatewhether there were any drugs in the driver's system.A reportable accident is defined in Part 394.3 as an accident which resultsin death of a human being or bodily injury to a person who, as a resultof the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the sceneof the accident; or total damage to all property aggregating $4,400 ormore based upon actual costs or reliable estimates.The FHWA is also interested in obtaining additional drug-use informationrelated to accidents. Under the final rule, an employee is subject to post-accidenttesting as soon as possible after the accident but in no case later than32 hours after the accident. Selection of this time period comports withthe Department of Transportation's post-accident testing program for DOTemployees, which provides a maximum of 8 hours to determine if an employeeis required to be tested and an additional 24 hours to obtain the samplefor testing. The FHWA is also requiring that motor carriers notify theFHWA, as part of the accident reporting requirements of 49 CFR Part 394,Notification and Reporting of Accidents, if a drug test (of any body fluid)was performed and the results of such test. Section 391.87 (proposed andSection;382.109)and Part 394 have been revised to add this provision to this rule.The FHWA believes this provision will provide the much needed informationregarding the relationship between drug use and accidents. As noted bymany commenters, mostly motor carriers and the NTSB, the practical issueof requiring a motor carrier to perform a drug test on a driver involvedin an accident away from the motor carrier's place of business would bevery difficult. The motor carrier may not be made aware of the accidentuntil several hours after the accident. The final rule expands the proposedrequirements by requiring a drug test for all reportable accidents. Thisrevision should increase information about drug-related accidents fromthat proposed in the NPRM.The National Governor's Association is conducting a research study on possibleimprovements in truck and bus accident reporting. As part of this study,it will be conducting pilot projects in several States to test a new accidentreporting form, reporting criteria and procedures. Based on the resultsof this study, the FHWA may further modify the accident reporting requirementsand procedures now contained in Part 394.Random TestingThe NPRM proposed that motor carriers establish anti-drug programs thatinclude random testing at a testing rate up to 125 percent. The FHWA askedhow such a testing program would work for smaller motor carriers and owner-operatorswho are not motor carriers.The majority of the commenters addressed the random testing element. Theyidentified several concerns with the concept of random testing. Of concernto many, were the legal issues. The FHWA is addressing to these concernsin another section of this preamble.The NPRM provided several suggestions on how drivers and motor carrierscould comply with the testing requirements (especially the random testingelement) in the rule. These suggestions were:1. Form consortiums made up of owner-operators and small carriers thatwould develop a centrally administered random testing program.2. Form consortiums, and hire a contractor to develop and implement a randomtesting program.3. Contract separately with an outside company that would setup these services.4. Have existing industry-related groups (e.g., trade associations) setupdrug programs in which small entities could participate.5. Arrange to be included as a part of a larger company's drug testingprogram.The ATA stated in its comments that the FHWA cannot have an effective randomdrug testing program if it mandates that motor carriers must do such testing.The ATA outlines two basic problems (1) 71% of the motor carriers haveonly one vehicle, and most of the others have less than six vehicles. Itis impossible for an owner-operator to test himself/herself randomly. (2)Drivers usually operate 100,000 miles a year. They are away from home mostof the time driving, loading and unloading, and waiting for loads and arenot readily available for random drug testing.The ATA believes that in the trucking industry, random testing is possibleonly through roadside random drug testing. The ATA contends that roadsidetesting, conducted by State enforcement officers participating in the MCSAPprogram, overcomes the trucking industry problems of carrier size and driveravailability. It overcomes the potential of management failure to havea random drug testing program and the potential for driver failure to obeyan order to be tested in a timely fashion after being notified that he/shehas been selected for random testing.The ATA further contends that a roadside program would create the crediblethreat that any driver, at any time, might be tested. A roadside test findingof positive drug use would result in disqualification of a driver for 1year for the first offense and lifetime for a second offense. This tougherpenalty would be a much stronger deterrent than the finding of ``unqualified''and a short layoff that would result from a similar test result if theFHWA mandates that motor carriers must conduct the random drug test program.The ATA believes that the FHWA has the legal authority under the MCSAPprogram, to require States to conduct random drug testing programs as acondition of receiving MCSAP funds. To do this, the ATA believes, the FHWAwould merely have to amend the FMCSRs to establish guidelines to be usedin conducting random drug testing and amend the MCSAP requirements in 49CFR Part 350 to specify a level of random testing required to receive MCSAPfunds. Upon receipt of a positive test result, the State agency would notifythe driver, the motor carrier, and the FHWA. The FHWA would obtain a copyof the test results and issue a letter of disqualification to the driver,with a copy to the Commercial Driver License Information System, the Stateof licensure, and the motor carrier. The FHWA would maintain a permanentrecord of drivers disqualified for 1 year and for those disqualified permanently.The ATA believes that consortiums, contractors, associations, and otherthird party organizations will be available to help motor carriers withtheir drug testing programs and that this will be a benefit to the carriersand to the FHWA drug abatement objectives, with the exception of randomdrug testing. The ATA does not believe that permitting third parties toset up and maintain drug testing programs would solve the trucking industryproblem of effective mandatory random drug testing by motor carriers. Thefact that third party programs are available does not mean that motor carrierswould make use of them.Many small carriers are located far from third party testing services andthe problem of driver availability for random testing will still existwith third party programs. Third party programs would not result in effectivesanctions for drivers with positive test results, comparable to the toughsanctions that would be imposed for positive test results through roadsidedrug testing.The ATA also indicated that the testing rate should be initiated at a targetrate of 10% and apply only to those drivers of commercial motor vehiclesof more than 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating (GVRW). The ATAbelieves that using the 26,000 pound threshold is consistent with the commercialdriver license program and will focus on those drivers who travel longerdistances and may be more tempted to use drugs because of being away fromhome for long periods. There is no deterrent from drug use for driversif the only penalty is a short time off until they can get a ``clean''test, as would be the case if the random testing program is made the responsibilityof motor carriers.The ATA agrees, however, that management must be allowed its own prerogativesfor disciplining a driver who has a positive test result, over and abovethe penalties mandated by Congress and the FHWA. To as great an extentas possible, the ATA asserts, the FHWA requirements should avoid preemptionof management programs established individually by motor carriers or throughcollective bargaining agreements.The ATA also supports a suggestion the FHWA included in the NPRM to providefor a revision of the sampling rates based upon success of the mandatoryrandom drug testing program. The ATA stated that success can be measuredbest through a roadside program of mandatory random drug testing, ratherthan requiring motor carriers to perform random testing.The National Private Trucking Association (NPTA) supports random testing,even if it is required to be performed by the motor carrier. In supportingrandom testing by carriers, however, NPTA noted that a legitimate distinctiondoes exist between the typical private carriage operation and the typicalfor-hire operation of a considerably large segment of the trucking industry,i.e., the truckload (TL) segment. That distinction concerns the use ofowner-operators. While the NPTA has expressed its fundamental support forcarrier-performed random testing, NPTA also believes the program wouldbe more effective, both from a practical standpoint and from a constitutionalstandpoint, if random tests were to be conducted by law enforcement personnelin conjunction with their roadside inspections. The NPTA urged the FHWAto give serious consideration to that approach as an alternative to carrierconducted random testing. The NPTA believes the final rule should requirethat the annual sampling rate for random testing be no less than 50%.The IBT stated that it is adamantly opposed to random drug testing. TheIBT views it as ``an affront to the human rights and personal dignity ofits members who may be subjected to it.'' The IBT contends that the goalfor a drug free transportation industry can be reached through the useof less intrusive forms of drug testing, such as reasonable cause and periodicphysical examinations, which do not suffer from the same constitutionalinfirmities inherent in random testing. The IBT disagrees with the FHWA'sstated belief that ``an employer-sponsored program is the most effectiveform of random testing.'' In fact, the IBT does not believe that employer-sponsoredrandom testing is feasible at all in the trucking industry. About 90% ofthe ``employers'' in trucking are either owner-operators or companies sosmall that a truly random program as the FHWA envisions is simply not workable.In the remaining small percentage of motor carriers, which will benefitleast from any government imposed drug testing program, practical and logisticalproblems will make it very difficult, and much more expensive than theFHWA foresees, to implement coherent random testing programs. The IBT indicated that none of the five options posed by the FHWA are reallyviable for random testing of owner-operators. Even supposing that voluntarilyconsortia could be established for random testing, there would be no wayto prevent a driver from simply withdrawing when his/her number came up.There could be no enforcement by the consortium if a driver did test positive.The communications system and network of collection sites that would beneeded to service such a consortium would have to be very expensive. The American Bus Association supports a random drug testing including the125% annual sampling rate since it led to such effective deterrence inthe results published by the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard.Greyhound Lines implemented its drug testing program in 1978 and supportsthe Department's initiative in the proposed rulemaking to require mandatorydrug testing of all heavy duty commercial motor vehicle drivers. Greyhoundis considering a random drug testing program that would annually test 75percent of its drivers and plans to adjust that percentage based upon findingsnationally and regionally as necessary. Greyhound indicated that it hasa significant problem concerning structuring a random testing program thatwould not adversely affect locations with 10 or fewer drivers. Greyhoundbelieves the final regulation should give motor carriers the flexibilityto adjust the percentage of drivers to be tested. Under this proposal,if a high percentage of ``positives'' were found from random tests conducted,then the percentage of tests would be increased until a deterrent effectis noted. The OOIDA is opposed to any form of random testing, whether by motor carriersor by Federal or State officials. The OOIDA believes that random testingis an embarrassment to those individuals who are innocent, and states thatit plans to challenge, in the courts, any final rule that includes provisionsrequiring random testing for commercial motor vehicle drivers. Other commenters support the concept of a random testing pilot programto evaluate the drug problem in the trucking industry and recommend appropriatesteps after evaluation of the program. Many commenters believe there isinsufficient evidence that random drug testing will serve as a deterrentto drug usage. <T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA continues to believe that random testingcan be an extremely effective method for decreasing drug use among commercialmotor vehicle drivers because abstinence from use is the only way to preparefor an unannounced test. The success of random drug screening has beendemonstrated in various programs. The United States Coast Guard implementeda random testing program for its uniformed personnel which led to a 75percent decrease in drug use over a 5-year period. The Department of Defensehas a random testing program which has resulted in a drop from 27 percentuse-rate in 1980 to 8.9 percent in 1985. The FHWA believes that random roadside drug testing at appropriate testinglevels would be a very effective deterrent to the use of drugs by commercialmotor vehicle drivers. The FHWA does not believe, however, that it canmandate such a program for State initiated enforcement. Unfortunately,the FHWA does not believe that this approach, as suggested by ATA and manyother commenters, is a viable option at this time. The FHWA believes, however, that an employer-sponsored program can includean effective form of random testing. As noted in the NPRM, the FHWA continuesto be concerned that the programs that will be established in responseto this final rule are fair and equitable to all motor carriers and drivers.The type of operation should not be used as an excuse to evade subjectingdrivers to random testing. The FHWA calls upon the industry to work togetherto ensure that drivers who use drugs and drive in interstate commerce areidentified and banned from driving until they are drug free. Only througha cooperative effort using the general framework established by this finalrule will this be achieved. Since the majority of the comments were opposed to random testing, informationon the specifics of such a program were not forthcoming. As noted in theNPRM, the FHWA is concerned about the rate of testing that would providean adequate level of deterrence. The ATA suggests that the initial ratebe set at 10% while the ABA believes the 125% rate should be used. TheNTSB suggested that a level closer to the upper limit should be chosen.The FHWA has decided that a minimum testing rate of 50% is to be used.Such a level will provide a base line to make adjustments as necessarybased on evidence of use at this rate. At this time, the FHWA believesthat a 50 percent minimum testing rate will provide a sufficient deterrentto drug use. This rate is also consistent with the random testing programcurrently applicable to civilian employees of the U.S. Department of Transportationoccupying sensitive safety and security-related positions. Those driverswho attempt to falsify their medical qualifications (by not admitting totesting positive and thereby being unqualified to drive) will be identified.Implied Consent and WaiversThe FHWA has deleted proposed andSection;andSection; 382.107 and 382.111 whichaddress waivers and implied consent. These sections are being deleted asunnecessary and/or redundant. Section 206(f) of the Motor Carrier SafetyAct of 1984 provides the Secretary with authority to waive, in whole orpart, any rules issued under the authority of this Act. This rule is beingissued under that authority. The FHWA believes an implied consent provisionis not needed in this rule since the requirements are to determine if adriver is qualified to drive in interstate commerce. Implementation ScheduleThis rule is effective December 21, 1988. A new andSection; 391.93, Implementation schedule, establishes a timetablefor implementing testing programs (pre-employment, periodic, reasonablecause, and post-accident) based on the number of drivers under the motorcarrier's control. Motor carriers with 50 or more ``drivers subject totesting'' are required to initiate a drug testing program by December 21,1989, for those drivers only. Other motor carriers will be required toinitiate a drug test for other drivers by December 21, 1990. ``Driverssubject to testing'' is defined as employee drivers and leased driverswho are leased for 90 days or more in a 365-day period. Motor carriersusing less than 50 drivers subject to testing are required to initiatea drug testing program by December 21, 1990.The threshold of 50 drivers subject to testing was chosen by the FHWA asthe level that would provide for an adequate selection pool for randomtesting. It would also provide, along with the other drug testing requirements,a sufficient number of tests to enable a basis for determining drug usewithin the motor carrier's driver work force. The number of tests requiredmay also enable the motor carrier to realize lower costs per test thusminimizing the economic impact of the rule. The FHWA is allowing for the additional year to initiate a drug testingelement to the drug testing programs for smaller motor carriers and motorcarriers using drivers for short time periods to allow them adequate timeto establish workable, equitable, and effective mechanisms to perform drugtesting, especially random testing. A minimum phase in schedule is also established for random testing in andSection;391.93. Commencing with the implementation date, motor carriers are requiredto perform random testing at a minimum as follows: (1) The random drugtesting is spread reasonably through the 12-month period; (2) The lasttest collection during the year is conducted at an annualized rate of 50percent; and (3) the total number of tests conducted during the 12 monthsis equal to at least 25 percent of the covered population. For some motor carriers, particularly those with a large number of driverssubject to drug testing, it may be a substantial burden to move from nodrug testing directly to a 50 percent random testing rate. If requiredto have tested 50 percent of all covered drivers by the end of the firstyear, motor carriers might have to test at rates far above a 50 percentrate toward the end of the year, to make up for lower rates at the beginning.Employers should be permitted to start out at a lower testing rate andwork up to 50 percent as experience is gained and the testing procedurebecomes administratively more routine. We do not want to create a situationwhich might lead to mistakes by requiring initial testing at too high arate.The final rule therefore provides an implementation procedure that wouldallow motor carriers to phase in random drug testing during the first 12months in which tests are conducted. Motor carriers would not be requiredto reach an annualized rate of 50 percent until the last test collection.The tests would have to be spaced reasonably through the year to permitthe motor carrier to phase in to the 50 percent rate, and the total numberof tests conducted would have to be equal to at least 25 percent of thedrivers subject to testing.Suppose, for example, that a motor carrier has 1,000 drivers subject totesting. At a 50 percent annual rate, 500 tests would have to be conductedduring a year. Under the phase in, however, the motor carrier could conductonly a few drug tests at the beginning of the program and then graduallyincrease the number of tests until, by the end of the year, the annualizedrate of 50 percent was achieved. Thus, if the motor carrier's drug testingplan contemplated administering random tests on 12 occasions during theyear, the motor carrier would need to administer at least 42 tests (500divided by 12) on the last occasion, but could administer fewer tests untilthen. Overall, the motor carrier would have to conduct at least 250 randomtests the first year. In subsequent years, the 50 percent rate would bemaintained. As noted in the NPRM, the FHWA envisions that many of the small motor carriersand owner-operators will form consortiums and other cooperatives to meetthe requirements of this rule. The FHWA encourages this and intends topromote such consortiums. The arrangements agreed to by these drivers andcarriers will be tailored to their specific operations and characteristics.The FHWA welcomes any type of arrangement as long as it complies with therequirements of this rule. An example of such an arrangement would be a consortium of owner-operatorshiring a contractor to administer their drug testing program (pre-use andrandom testing elements of the program). The contractor would be responsiblefor notifying the drivers selected for random testing, ensuring that thetest collection site, chain of custody procedures, and testing laboratoryall comply with 49 CFR Part 40. Furthermore, the contractor would alsoobtain the medical review officer who would be responsible for interpretingthe results, including verification of positive tests and notifying thedriver and/or motor carrier of the results of the tests. The consortium would also serve as the repository of all summary informationregarding the ``makeup'' of the random test. Information regarding thenumber of tests performed and the results of the tests as well as the randomselection procedures would provide objective and credible data to substantiatean effective and equitable testing program. As noted in the comments, many owner-operators operating under short termtrip-lease arrangements are not aware of their destinations sufficientlyin advance to ensure that their location at any given time would be knownto others. Often these operations consist of delivering a load in one cityunder a trip-lease agreement for a motor carrier, then calling a brokeror another motor carrier to obtain another load, in many cases, to a destinationother than the originating city. The FHWA recognizes such operations anddoes not intend, by this rule, to alter such arrangements. It is incumbenton the motor carrier entering into a trip-lease arrangement with the owner-operatorto have drug testing program to ensure that the driver is not using drugs.With regard to the example cited above, the FHWA envisions that the motorcarrier would verify that the owner operator is participating in a bonafide drug testing program through a consortium and verify that the driveris not currently unqualified because of testing positive for drug use bycontacting the consortium prior to entering into a lease agreement withthe driver. The motor carrier has the option of subjecting these drivers to a randomtest under the motor carrier sponsored program. The rule allows motor carriersto accept bona fide consortium drug testing program in lieu of their carrier-basedprogram. The above example illustrates the potential for cooperation betwen motorcarriers and owner-operators participating in a consortium. The motor carrierwould be relying on the consortium to perform the pre-employment and randomtesting for potential drivers, thereby complying with the testing requirementswith little impact on their operations. At the same time, drivers who areselected for testing under the consortium's random selection process couldbe notified through the motor carrier when the carrier calls the consortiumto verify the drivers participation. Those drivers not using drugs wouldbe subject to minimal delays in obtaining loads due to these requirements.If a motor carrier uses the same driver on a number of different trip contracts,the motor carrier would only have to check once every 6-month period onthat driver. Those drivers who attempt to falsify their medical qualifications(by not admitting to testing positive and thereby being unqualified todrive) should be identified by this process. Conflict with Foreign LawsThe FHWA has determined not to make the rule applicable in any situationwhere compliance would violate the domestic laws or policies of anothercountry. In addition, because of the potential confusion that may existinvolving application of this rule in situations where compliance couldviolate foreign laws or policies. The FHWA has determined not to make therule applicable, until January 1, 1990, in any situation where a foreigngovernment contends that compliance with our rule raises questions of compatibilitywith its domestic laws or policies. During the next year, the Departmentof Transportation and other U.S. government officials will be working closelywith representatives of foreign governments with the goal of reaching apermanent resolution to any conflict between our rule and foreign lawsand policies. The U.S. and Canadian Governments have already establisheda bilateral working group in an attempt to achieve this objective. TheFHWA believes that considerable progress has already been made and furthermeetings will be held in the near future. While the FHWA believes thatthis can be a model for addressing the concerns of other countries, itis not intended to be the exclusive means. The FHWA Administrator may delaythe effective date further under this section, if such delay is necessaryto permit consultation with any foreign governments to be successfullycompleted. It is the FHWA's intention to issue a notice, no later than December 1,1989, that would make any necessary amendments to the rule as a resultof discussions with foreign governments. Shortly after their issuance,any such notices will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. While the FHWA recognizes that any decisionnot to apply this rule to foreign citizens has the potential to createsome anomalous conditions in competitive situations, it is the intentionof the U.S. government to make every effort to resolve potential conflictswith foreign governments in a manner that accommodates their concerns whileensuring the necessary level of safety by those that the FHWA regulates.Prescription Medication A driver would be allowed to use a controlled substance (except for methadone)when taken as prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner who is familiarwith the driver's medical history and assigned duties. Under andSection;391.97 (proposed andSection; 382.203) Prescribed drugs, a driver would havean affirmative defense to an allegation that he/she unlawfully used a controlledsubstance. The driver would have to prove, through clear and convincingevidence, that his/her use of the controlled substance was as prescribedby the licensed medical practitioner. The motor carrier, MRO, and the driver would have flexibility in applyingthis provision. For example, when a driver tests positive for the use ofcontrolled substances, a driver has the burden of proof to document theuse was lawful. The motor carrier and the MRO may accept the affirmativedefense and allow the driver to continue to operate, or request the opinionof another physician. The MRO may provide an opportunity for a driver todiscuss a positive test result and clarify if a prescribed medication wasinvolved. If the motor carrier elects the latter option and a medical disputefollows, the motor carrier or the driver has the option of bringing thequestion of the driver's qualification to the Office of Motor Carriersfor resolution through 49 CFR 391.47, Resolution of conflict of medicalevaluation. The FHWA views use of andSection; 391.47 as a last resort, however, and believesthat the motor carrier, the licensed physician, and the driver can bestresolve disputes regarding a positive test result due to the use of prescribedcontrolled substances. The final decision should be based on whether thereis evidence of abuse of the medication or whether the controlled substancecauses the driver to be a risk while operating a commercial motor vehicle.The FHWA currently prohibits the use of methadone by interstate commercedrivers. Docket comments to the ANPRM of May 13, 1986, from the Legal ActionCenter of New York requested that we allow drivers in interstate commerceto use prescribed methadone. The Center stated that a driver on a methadonemaintenance program is a safe driver even though he/she is taking an addictivecontrolled substance. Section 391.97(b) (proposed andSection; 382.203(b)) provides that nothingin this rule restricts a motor carrier from requiring a driver to notifythe motor carrier of therapeutic drug use before driving. The ATA believes that the FHWA should require a driver who is using prescriptionmedication to notify the motor carrier before driving a commercial motorvehicle. The motor carrier should have the option of using a driver, dependingupon the recommendation of a medical doctor, because there are many prescriptiondrugs that are subject to abuse by drivers. There are also drugs that haveside effect which may adversely affect a driver's ability to safely operatea commercial vehicle. The ATA believes that owner-operators and casualdrivers should be required to give advance notification of prescriptiondrug use to motor carriers prior to leasing or working for such carriers.The ATA believes that any driver who is not employed by a motor carrier,or who is a motor carrier and who is using prescription medication shouldbe required to carry a letter from the doctor who prescribed the medicationcertifying that its use is not subject to abuse and that it does not haveside effects which will adversely affect driving ability. If the foregoingprocedures are adhered to, a driver should be able to use them as an affirmativedefense against a positive drug test. The ATA continues to oppose the useof methadone by drivers and recommends that the FHWA should continue itsprohibition against methadone usage. The IBT commented that the discussion under prescription medication mightlead many drivers and motor carriers to the erroneous conclusion that the``defense'' that a positive drug test was caused by prescription medicationwill normally involve the motor carrier. In fact, the usual circumstancewill be that the motor carrier's only involvement will be through the MedicalReview Officer (MRO). Under 49 CFR Part 40, the section dealing with reviewfor prescription medication states, ``If the Medical Review Officer determinesthere is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test result,he or she shall determine that the result is consistent with legal druguse and take no further action.'' Hence, the IBT believes that the questionof prescription medication is one that should, in most cases, be resolvedbetween the driver and his MRO, without company officials with personnel,labor relations, or operations responsibilities ever becoming aware ofit. Only if and when the driver challenges the MRO's decision and resortseither to the andSection; 391.47 appeals process or to a contractual grievanceprocedure will nonmedical personnel have occasion to find out about themedication ``defense.'' The NPTA supports the FHWA's proposal to give drivers the opportunity toassert their bona fide use of prescription drugs as an affirmative defense.The FHWA also agree with the concern raised in the preamble about the possibleabuse of prescription drugs. The FHWA, therefore, supports requiring driversto ``demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence'' that the driver'suse of a controlled substance was prescribed by a licensed physician ``whois familiar with the driver's medical history and assigned duties.'' TheFHWA also supports amending the proposed rule to require that, as a preconditionto asserting this defense, drivers give motor carriers advance notice oftheir use of any prescription drug before driving. At the same time, theNPTA also recognizes that there may be instances where providing advancenotice may not always be possible. They recommend that the final rule shouldalso make clear that if a driver fails to provide the carrier with therequired notice, but later meets the requisite evidentiary burden, thedecision on whether to discipline the driver is entirely the motor carrier's.<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> The FHWA is sympathetic to the concerns raisedby these commenters on this issue, but believes that andSection; 391.97 (proposedandSection; 382.203) as proposed in the NPRM is satisfactory. An MRO shouldmake a determination if there was a legitimate explanation for a positivetest result and that the result is consistent with legal drug use and thatno further action is necessary. Most cases could then be resolved betweenthe driver and the MRO. Motor carriers, at their option, may require driversto provide notice that they are using prescription drugs prior to drivingand/or testing.Who Is To Be TestedIt continues to be the FHWA's belief that the driver is the most criticalindividual involved in ensuring the safe operation of a commercial motorvehicle. The driver is responsible for ensuring the vehicle is in safeoperating condition prior to its operation, during its operation, and afterhe/she has finished operating the vehicle. It is believed that a persontested positive for the use of a controlled substance would be less likelyto ensure that the vehicle is in safe operating condition at any giventime during which the driver is on duty.Other occupations within the motor carrier industry, most notably mechanics(i.e., mechanics, mechanic helpers, tire changers, etc.) are not coveredby this rule due to the difficulty in identifying those persons, especiallythose who do not work for a motor carrier. The FHWA believes it would bevery difficult to identify and test, in a credible manner, all the individualswho maintain and/or repair commercial motor vehicles. This final rule,however, does not prohibit motor carriers from including their mechanicsor other employees in the program.The FHWA proposed using one of two definitions to regulate motor carriersand drivers. The first was based on the definition of ``commercial motorvehicle'' contained in the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 and the applicabilityprovisions specified in 49 CFR 390.3, General Applicability. The FHWA publisheda final rule regarding the general provisions of the FMCSRs on May 19,1988 (53 FR 18042). This definition uses a gross vehicle weight ratingor a gross vehicle combination weight rating criterion of 10,001 poundsor more. Both definitions also include vehicles designed to transport 16or more persons and all vehicles transporting placardable quantities ofhazardous materials. The second definition is based on the Commercial MotorVehicle Safety Act of 1986 which defines ``commercial motor vehicle'' asa motor vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 pounds ormore. Section 390.3, General applicability, specifies which entities aresubject to FMCSRs and which entities and operations are exempt from theFMCSRs. Generally, the FMCSRs are applicable to all employees and employerswho transport property or passengers in interstate commerce. The exceptionsto this general applicability are:(1) All school bus operations as defined in andSection; 390.5;(2) Transportation performed by the Federal Government, a State, or anypolitical subdivision of a State, or an agency established under a compactbetween States that has been approved by the Congress of the United States.(3) The occasional transportation of personal property by individuals notfor compensation nor in the furtherance of a commercial enterprise;(4) The transportation of human corpses or sick and injured persons;(5) The operation of fire trucks and rescue vehicles while involved inemergency and related operations;(6) Any ``exempt intracity zone'' operation, as defined in andSection; 390.5,if a State has adopted and enforces State laws and regulations, compatiblewith the rules in this subchapter, applicable to such intracity zone operation;and(7) The private transportation of passengers. In addition, the rules inPart 391 (Qualifications of Drivers) of the FMCSRs generally do not applyto a farm vehicle driver. The farm driver exemptions found in 391.2 and391.67 have been in effect since December 22, 1971, and were issued tomeet specific, unique transportation needs of the country's farm community.Several commenters were confused as to the exact applicability of the rule.While the preamble indicated that the rule would only apply to those driversand motor carriers that were subject to the FMCSRs, the proposed regulatorylanguage did not make this distinction. Proposed andSection; 382.103 statedthe proposed rule would apply to <T3>all</T3> motor carriers and drivers operating in interstate commerce.Farmer-related organizations, while supporting the NPRM, recommended thatfarmers be excluded from the requirements. The commenters were generallysupportive of the use of the term ``commercial motor vehicle'' as it isused in andSection; 390.5 of the FMCSRs (i.e., 10,001 pounds or more). TheATA recommends that the 26,000 pound GVWR threshold be used.<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> The intent of the NPRM, though not explicitly statedin the regulatory language, was to have these drug testing requirementsapply to motor carriers and drivers who are currently subject to the physicalqualifications requirements of 49 CFR 391.11(b)(6). Since this rule onlyaddresses qualification standards (as opposed to disqualification standards),only those drivers who are required to be physically qualified to driveare to be subject to this rule. Section 391.83 (proposed andSection; 382.103)has been changed to reflect this intent. The rules in this Subpart willapply to any person who operates a commercial motor vehicle, as definedin 49 CFR 390.5 (except the vehicle size criterion is 26,001 pounds GVWR,instead of 10,001 pounds), in interstate commerce that is subject to thedriver qualifications of andSection; 391.11(b)(6). All drivers and motorcarriers exempted under 49 CFR 390.3 (which becomes effective November15, 1988) and andSection; 391.2 are not subject to this rule.The implementation of this Subpart is a significant undertaking for themotor carrier industry. The industry will need to expend a high level ofadministrative and financial resources to complete the task. The FHWA believesthat the initial implementation of this rule should concentrate, as inthe Commercial Driver's License Program, to drivers of vehicles which couldresult in the greatest benefits. Since the fatality rate for vehicles above26,000 pounds is significantly greater than vehicles between 10,000 and26,000 pounds, the FHWA has applied these rules at this time to vehicleswith a GVWR of 26,001 pounds and above. In addition to the improved administrativecosts and improved benefit/cost ratio, limitation to the heavy vehicleswill also reduce the demand to create consortiums to facilitate the needsof the anti-drug programs for small carriers.The smaller vehicles are also typically dispatched and return to a motorcarrier's place of business on a daily basis. Unlike most long distance,heavy truck drivers, the operators of smaller vehicles are under the supervisionand observation of the employer to a larger degree. Accordingly, the FHWAbelieves that the drug detection training provided to motor carrier dispatchersand supervisors will carry over to drivers of smaller vehicles.The FHWA notes that it is developing an NPRM pertaining to the privatetransportation of passengers in interstate commerce. When that rule becomesfinal, certain drivers of such vehicles would be subject to the drug testingrules. Similarly, the intracity exempt (commercial) zones will be eliminatedshortly because of legislation expected to be signed by the President anddrivers in those zones will be covered by this rule.This rule is not applicable with respect to any person for whom compliancewith this part would violate the domestic laws or policies of another country.See discussion under section titled, Conflict with Foreign Laws.Effect on the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance ProgramAs noted earlier, this final rule is codified in Part 391, Qualificationsof Drivers as opposed a separate section (Part 382) as proposed in theNPRM. The FHWA does not intend that this revision affect intrastate motorcarrier operations in anyway or Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Programfunding for any State. This is consistent with the proposed applicabilitysection (andSection; 382.103) which stated, ``This part applies to motorcarriers and drivers operating in interstate commerce.''The FHWA intends, however, to investigate in a separate notice of proposedrulemaking, the inclusion of intrastate drivers of large trucks and othervehicles in this rule.Action on Receipt of Positive Drug TestThe IBT believes that much of the FHWA's discussion in the preamble tothe NPRM under this heading, including virtually everything described inthe first paragraph_except for the last sentence about taking ``appropriatepersonnel action''_falls within the purview of the MRO under 49 CFR Part40. This is one of the many specifics that the FHWA incorporates by referencewith its repeated requirement in Subparts C, D, E, and F of the NPRM thata motor carrier shall require its drug testing program to conform with49 CFR Part 40. The IBT stated that the FHWA should take care not to leavea contrary impression with readers of the final rule.<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> The FHWA agrees with the IBT comment and affirmativelyexcludes that discussion from this final rule.Notification of Test Results and Recordkeeping<T3>Notification: </T3>Many of the commenters opposed the proposed requirementthat a motor carrier must notify a driver-applicant of the results of acontrolled substance test. Their rationale was that since such a largenumber of driver-applicants would be given a ``pre-employment'' test, itwould be unduly burdensome to impose such a requirement on the industry.<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA believes these concerns are valid ones.However, we believe that the driver-applicant has the right to know theresults of such a test if the driver-applicant requests such informationwithin a reasonable period of time. Therefore, the FHWA will not requirea motor carrier to make known the results of a ``pre-employment'' drugtest unless the driver-applicant requests such results within 60 days ofbeing notified of the disposition of the employment application. Conversely,the results of all other drug tests must be made known to a motor carrieremployee any time the test results are ``positive.'' The employee mustbe informed that the test indicated ``positive'' results and what drug(s)was discovered.<T3>Record Retention: </T3>The FHWA had proposed that controlled substancetest results be retained in the driver's qualification file for a periodof 3 years. Most motor carrier commenters agreed with the proposal andarticulated the belief that a motor carrier will establish procedures tosafeguard against unauthorized release much the same as has been done forthe protection of other personnel records. The ATA generally agreed withthe retention period but contended that the results of a controlled substancetest should be retained for a longer period of time when the test resultedin a driver disqualification for a period of 1 year or permanently. TheIBT also agreed with the retention period and went farther when it stated:``This regulation should further stipulate that the only test results inthose files must be whether the outcome was reported `negative' or `positive'by the [medical review officer] MRO. Negative test results should onlybe maintained on file for a period of 12 months. Underlying laboratoryreports and other confidential medical information may only be retainedin the MRO's files, in keeping with 2.8 of the HHS Guidelines.''<T3>FHWA Response: </T3>The FHWA believes that the test results of anycontrolled substance test should be kept confidential. To accomplish this,the motor carrier is required to retain, in the driver's qualificationfile, such information that will indicate only the following:(1) The employee submitted to a controlled substance test.(2) The date of such test.(3) The identity of the person or entity performing the test and who isthe custodian of the detailed test results.(4) Whether the test finding was ``positive'' or ``negative.''The medical review officer (MRO) who is an agent for the motor carrieris required to be the sole custodian of the individual test results. Webelieve these retention requirements along with the access requirementsdiscussed below will ensure the confidentiality desired.<T3>Comment: </T3>Access to Individual Test Records or Test Findings. TheATA expressed concern about subsequent or prospective motor carriers beingallowed access to information about controlled substance test results.It stated: ``Subsequent or prospective motor carriers must be allowed accessto information about drug test results and about disqualification for druguse or this whole program has little meaning. If a driver knows that subsequentusers of his/her services will not be told about positive drug tests anddisqualifications then the deterrent value of the tests is lost. The druguser will be able to hop from one job to another with little concern aboutthe drug use being detected by future users of his/her service.''The IBT, on the other hand, believes that ``a testing employer [under]no circumstances should be permitted to release test results to a subsequentor prospective employer.'' The IBT continued by stating: ``The resultswill be of very little value to a future employer. If the testing employerhas continuously employed an individual for a period of time, it can beinferred that the individual tested negative during that time. If the individualhas tested positive and successfully gone through rehabilitation, thatis information the prospective employer should not use in making an employmentdecision. If the individual was discharged on the basis of a positive test,that will become immediately apparent to the prospective employer. Furthermore,the pre-employment-employment drug test renders past drug test historyof little value.''<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> As stated above, the FHWA believes that the testresults of any controlled substance test should be kept confidential. Therefore,andSection; 391.89 prohibits a MRO from releasing the confidential informationin the MRO's possession to anyone without first obtaining written authorizationfrom the affected person who was previously tested.<T3>Comment: </T3>Maintenance of Summary Data. Measuring the effectivenessof the controlled substance testing program is essential to the successof any drug test program. The IBT asserts that the best answer lies inthe collection of aggregate data, primarily from testing laboratories.In the interest of reducing the reporting burden, the IBT suggested collectingthe desired data from the testing laboratories in lieu of the motor carrier.It suggested that the FHWA require monthly statistical reports to be filedby the testing laboratories since monthly statistical summaries are alreadyrequired by the Department of Health and Human Services for evaluatingthe Federal government's drug testing program.<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> The FHWA agrees that the collection and evaluationof statistical data is of prime importance. However, such a requirementas that proposed by the IBT could place an unnecessary burden on the testinglaboratories and could require additional government expense that cannotbe cost justified at this time. In an effort to ensure that the statisticaldata is available when needed, andSection; 391.87 requires that each motorcarrier or consortium collect and retain specific information in its files.The FHWA plans to statistically sample the available information to evaluatethe effectiveness of the program. Additionally, the information collectedby individual motor carriers will be reviewed whenever a compliance reviewis performed by the agency's field staff.HHS GuidelinesIn the notice of proposed rulemaking for the rule, the FHWA proposed thatall drug testing take place in accordance with the Mandatory Guidelinesfor Federal Drug Testing Programs of the Department of Health and HumanServices (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988). These guidelines describe the collectionand testing procedures applicable to all drug testing in the Federal government,and they include safeguards for the accuracy and privacy of testing.The Department of Transportation has determined that certain modificationsof the HHS Guidelines are appropriate in the context of this and otherDOT operating administration drug-free workplace regulations. The resultis that the Office of the Secretary in the Department of Transportationis publishing elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4> an Interim Final Rule With Request for Commentsentitled, <T3>Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs</T3>,that codifies the Department of Health and Human Service Guidelines fordrug testing at 49 CFR Part 40. This new part sets forth requirements forsuch things as specimen collection procedures, laboratory procedures, qualityassurance and certification procedures. The rule will provide further guidanceon how this rule shall be implemented. These DOT Procedures are intendedto preserve, to the greatest extent practicable, the important safeguardsprovided by the HHS Guidelines.Some of the modifications to the HHS Guidelines are editorial in nature(for example, references to responsibilities of ``agencies'' are changedto references to ``employers''). Other modifications are intended to takeinto account differences in the situations of Federal agencies and DOTregulated industries. For example, in testing at remote sites, DOT requiredindustries may find it necessary to conduct some kinds of testing in medicalfacilities or through use of mobile units, rather than the more permanentcollection sites contemplated by the HHS Guidelines. It may not be practicablefor regulated parties to maintain on-site permanent log books. Consequently,the DOT Procedures permit alternative collection and recordkeeping proceduresin these circumstances.During the comment period on this drug-free workplace program rule andthose proposed by other operating administrations, comments were receivedconcerning the HHS Guidelines. These comments will be incorporated in thedocket for the Office of the Secretary (OST) interim final rule creating49 CFR Part 40. The OST will respond to those comments, as well as commentsreceived during the comment period for Part 40, in its notice followingthe end of that comment period.The FHWA acknowledges the comments regarding testing for drugs which HHShas not established cutoff levels and which are not included in the bimonthlychallenge test samples which are a very important part of the HHS laboratorycertification program. However, the FHWA believes that testing for the5 classes of drugs (marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), andamphetamines) should be incorporated in the testing requirements for preemployment,periodic, post-accident, and random. However, the FHWA believes that testingconducted under ``reasonable cause'' should involve only those controlledsubstances as addressed in 49 CFR Part 40.Section 391.81(b) of this regulation provides that a motor carrier maytest the sample obtained under this rule only for the drugs required orspecifically authorized to be tested under this rule. That is, a motorcarrier must test the sample for the five major drugs listed in andSection;391.81(b). Only if, in the context of reasonable cause testing, the FederalHighway Administrator authorizes testing for additional Drug X under 49CFR Part 40 (an approval which would be granted only after consultationwith the Department of Health and Human Services, and only on the basisof an HHS-established testing protocol and positive threshold) may themotor carrier also test the sample for that drug.Absent such an approval, if the motor carrier wants to test, in addition,for Drug Y, the motor carrier must obtain a second sample from the driver.The obtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of thissubpart. The motor carrier must base its request for the second sampleon whatever other legal authority is available, since the motor carriercannot rely on this rule as the basis for the request.Employee Assistance Programs and RehabilitationIn the NPRM the FHWA had proposed several alternatives for employee assistanceprograms and rehabilitation. Under the first three options, an employeewould have been entitled to enter a rehabilitation program, under circumstanceswhich varied by option, and the employer would have been required to holdthe employee's position open while the employee underwent rehabilitation.The FHWA was encouraged to note that many of the commenters indicated thatas part of their current drug testing programs they provide the opportunityfor rehabilitation for their drivers. While the FHWA realizes that thepractice of providing rehabilitation or drug testing is not universal inthe motor carrier industry, the experiences of those who do provide rehabilitationand drug testing indicate that it is feasible.While the majority of the commenters supported rehabilitation programsfor drug users, there was a divergence of views on the criteria for providingrehabilitation and who should assume the costs of such a program. Relatedto the issue of rehabilitation was the provision that a driver be providedwith employment reinstatement rights at the completion of a rehabilitationprogram and a negative test for controlled substances. Technical concerns,such as assurances that the driver is in fact rehabilitated, the lengthof a rehabilitation program and the procedures to assure that the formerdrug using driver continues to abstain from drug use once he/she completesa rehabilitation program, were raised by the commenters.Those commenters representing motor carriers were in favor of leaving thedecision to provide rehabilitation and reemployment rights to management-labornegotiations. These commenters also noted that they do not believe thatthe FHWA has the legal authority to require motor carriers to pay for rehabilitationprograms for persons who the motor carrier decides should not be commercialmotor vehicle drivers.Those commenters representing drivers were in favor of motor carrier sponsoredrehabilitation programs. They noted that those drivers found to be usingdrugs and not rehabilitated would not leave the motor carrier industrybut would seek employment with another motor carrier. They believe thatthis would just transfer the drug problem within society, not reduce it,as they contend is the overall goal of the FHWA's anti-drug rulemaking.<T3>FHWA Response:</T3> While the FHWA recognizes the significance of thearguments raised in defense of broad rehabilitation opportunities and jobsecurity for employees who use drugs, it is important to emphasize thatthe FHWA's primary duty is to consider the adverse safety consequencessurrounding the issue of drug use within the motor carrier industry. TheFHWA has decided that motor carriers will not be required, by this rule,to offer an opportunity for rehabilitation or to provide job security todrivers who fail a drug test, who use drugs on the job, or who voluntarilycome forward and request rehabilitation.It is understood that broad rehabilitation opportunities and job securityfor employees, without regard to the manner of detection of drug use, mayhelp those drivers who are unable to help themselves. However, the FHWAbelieves that the comprehensive testing program of commercial motor vehicledrivers combined with an employee assistance program to educate and trainall personnel, is the most effective approach to promote safety and willreduce drug use in the motor carrier industry.Moreover, the FHWA encourages motor carriers and consortiums to developtheir own policies regarding rehabilitation. This rule neither prohibitsa motor carrier from assigning a driver to a nondriving duty nor requiresthe driver to use vacation time, sick leave or leave without pay in orderto accommodate that person's rehabilitation activities. Issues such astermination, reassignment, hiring of temporary drivers to fill a position,or policies regarding a driver's absence from a position are, the FHWAbelieves, issues that are appropriately the subject of labor-managementnegotiations and are not issues to be addressed in this rulemaking action.The FHWA investigated rehabilitation programs and found that the leasttime that it would take to complete a rehabilitation program would be 28days. It would probably take an additional 14 days to enroll an individualin such a program. This would have requried an employer to keep an employee'sposition available for a minimum of 42 days for a rehabilitation program.Thorough rehabilitation programs which ended an employee's dependence ondrugs could take much longer. There did not seem to be a means to implementmandatory rehabilitation without the FHWA being involved in the day-to-daymanagement of the motor carrier. Rehabilitation rights also diluted thedeterrent effect of the proposed regulations.A driver with a drug problem must never be permitted to function in a positionwhere his/her actions could affect the safe operation of a commercial motorvehicle. Consequently, rehabilitation and employment rights for employeeswill not be mandated. In all cases, of course, employers would be freeto offer rehabilitation. This provides the most flexibility to labor andmanagement to determine the need for and shape of any rehabilitation program.It also provides a deterrent to drug use and thus, may yield large benefitswith low costs.We note that under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, driversare disqualified for 1 year if they are convicted of operating a motorvehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. However, the issue ofbeing under the influence of a drug is different from simply having drugsin one's system. It is to the latter, stricter standard that this ruleis addressed.The FHWA is concerned about follow-up testing of drivers who have completedrehabilitation after testing positive in a random test. The FHWA believesthat motor carriers should have wide latitude in postrehabilitation testing,permitting the motor carrier to vary the frequency and duration of suchtesting on a case-by-case basis. Recommendations on an adequate periodof follow-up random testing vary from 1 to 3 years. Some information revealsthat 3 to 4 tests per year may be sufficient. Continuing treating and follow-uptesting of employees returned to driving are important measures from thepoint of view of the recovering substance abuser and the public safety.Although this rule does not require that persons testing positive be affordedthe opportunity for rehabilitation, it is inevitable that many will beoffered that opportunity, particularly many testing positive for the firsttime. The knowledge that a follow-up test may be required can assist therecovering driver and offer important assurance from the point of viewof the public safety. The final rule provides that, after returning towork, a recovering driver must continue in any program of after-care requiredby the EAP counselor and be subject to follow-up testing for not longerthan 60 months after return to duty.An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is designed to help employees solveproblems and provide motor carriers with a method for dealing with driverproblems, such as drugs. An EAP may include the following components:(a) Employee policy and procedures on drug use based on a motor carrier'sunique needs, organizational structure, and goals and resources;(b) Employee communications that include ongoing printed educational materialsdirected at both drivers and family members;(c) Training of supervisors; and (d) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the EAP.The FHWA has determined that properly managed EAPs benefit both the motorcarrier and the driver. All motor carriers shall develop EAPs for theiremployees. Each EAP is required to have an educational component whichwould minimally have display and distribution of informational material;display and distribution of a community-service hot-line telephone numberfor driver assistance (if one is available); and display and distributionof the company policy regarding drug use by drivers. Additionally, eachEAP of a motor carrier would be required to provide training for driversand supervisory personnel. The training would minimally require the followingelements: The effects and consequences of drug use on personal health,safety, and work environment; the manifestations and behavioral causesthat may indicate drug use and abuse; and documentation of training givento drivers and motor carrier's supervisory personnel. An EAP training programfor drivers and supervisory personnel would consist of at least 60 minutestraining for every driver and supervisor.Motor carriers will be required to appoint or designate a Medical ReviewOfficer (MRO). The MRO will perform several functions, including reviewof the results of the motor carrier's drug testing program; interpretationof each confirmed positive test result; provide an opportunity for a driverto discuss a positive test result with the MRO; and evaluation of an individualin conjunction with a rehabilitation program, if the motor carrier voluntarilyimplements one. This rule requires that an MRO be a licensed doctor ofmedicine or osteopathy. The MRO could be a currently employed company physicianor could be a private physician who performs MRO service for the motorcarrier on a contractual basis.The FHWA recognizes that not all motor carriers have the fiscal resourcesto implement a ``company'' EAP. However, a motor carrier has a responsibility,both to its drivers and the public, to provide an environment where safetyis not jeopardized by drug use. It is suggested that a motor carrier provideEAP services through one of the following means:(a) Motor carrier operated EAP;(b) Contractor/consortium arrangement;(c) Arrangements with local community service organizations; or(d) Other workable alternatives which provide an equivalent level of service.The FHWA believes that a long-term, will-run EAP will pay for itself overtime in lower costs for health care, absenteeism, accidents, and workercompensation. A large motor carrier may find that an internal program utilizingthe services of fellow drivers is most economical as well as effective.Some motor carriers may have access to programs run by community serviceagencies which are made available at little or no cost. Labor unions mayalso provide programs. Counseling services may also be available as partof a driver's medical insurance plan. Companies should investigate thefacilities and services available to them and their drivers and the benefitof establishing internal programs consistent with the size and scope oftheir operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Economic Analysis</ITAG>This is a summary of the industry cost impact and benefit evaluation forthe regulatory changes implemented in this rulemaking on drug testing programsfor commercial motor vehicle operators. Testing under these rules wouldbe conducted prior to employment, periodically, randomly, after a reportableaccident and upon reasonable cause.The rules are needed to prohibit absolutely the presence of a prohibiteddrug in a driver's system at any time. The rules are intended to ensurea drug-free highway environment and to eliminate drug abuse in the commercialmotor carrier industry.The assumptions and cost factors used in preparing the economic impactestimates of the changes have been developed by the FHWA. Cost data werefurnished by motor carriers, motor carrier industry associations, drugtesting laboratories, and trade publications. These estimates of cost impactinclude revisions based on public comment and other information that becameavailable.This rule will affect up to approximately 200,000 interstate motor carriersand about 3 million commercial motor vehicle drivers. These entities willincur additional costs because they will be required to comply with theproposed antidrug programs specified in this rule.The FHWA believes that three major benefits will accrue from this rulemaking.First, there will be benefits due to the prevention of fatalities, personalinjuries, and property loss resulting from accidents attributed to neglector error on the part of commercial motor vehicle operators whose judgmentor motor skills were impaired by the use of illicit substances.Second, benefits will accrue to motor carriers and drivers from the reductionin pilferage, absenteeism, medical and insurance costs, and improved generalsafety and productivity in the work place.Third, the reduction of drug abuse in a vital and socially important industrysuch as the commercial motor carrier industry would represent a broad publicbenefit.Those commenting on the economic analysis of the NPRM generally indicatedthat the unit costs assumed by the FHWA were too low and that not all thecosts were analyzed. In addition, the IBT questioned the basis for someof the assumptions used in the analysis. The FHWA has revised the analysisto include additional administrative costs (from $10 to $35) in responseto the comments that the costs associated with the MRO to review positivetest results and the recordkeeping costs were not included. The FHWA alsoraised the unit costs of the screen and confirmation test from $15 to $25and from $25 to $35, respectively.The NPRM included analyses of random testing rates of 12.5% and 125%. Asnoted in this rule, the FHWA is requiring a testing rate of 50% phasedin over a two year period. The deterrent rates have been adjusted to reflectthis testing rate. This analysis uses deterrent rates of 50 and 70 percent.The implementation schedule included in this rule is not reflected in thisanalysis.Based on the revisions noted above, as well as the 26,001 pound GVWR threshold,the FHWA estimated that the costs (net present value) associated with thisrule using option 4 proposed in the NPRM is $1.77 billion and the benefitis $8.14 billion for a benefit/cost ratio of 4.60.This cost-benefit analysis did not attempt to estimate the benefits ofincreased productivity, lower worker's compensation claims, and reducedinsurance rates that a drug-free driver work force would provide to theiremployers and society-at-large. It is reasonable to assume that addingthe value of these more pervasive benefits to the annual cost savings ofavoided accidents would significantly offset some of the costs of a drugtesting program for interstate or foreign commercial motor vehicle operators.Because the impact of this proposal will result in an annual effect onthe economy of over $100 million, the FHWA has determined that this documentis a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to Executive Order12498, this rulemaking action has been included on the Regulatory Programfor significant rulemaking actions. A regulatory evaluation and regulatoryflexibility analysis have been prepared and are available for review inthe public docket.The impacts of this proposed regulation on small entities are discussedin the regulatory flexibility analysis. A significant part of the motorcarrier industry and other employers covered by the Act are made up ofsmall firms, from one-person, one-truck operations of some owner-operators,to the thousands of small fleet operators throughout the country. For thisreason, the benefit and cost considerations described in the regulatoryevaluation/regulatory flexibility analysis as applicable to employers andthe motor carrier industry in general, are equally applicable to the smallentity component of the industry.The FHWA estimates that this final rule will increase the information collectionand paperwork requirements for motor carriers. In anticipation of this,the FHWA has submitted, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ina revision to their revised fiscal year 1988 information collection budget,an estimate of the burden hours associated with this rule. FHWA will submitfor OMB approval any information collection requirements. Comments on thepaperwork burdens should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget,Attention of Mr. Gary Waxman.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>In the NPRM, the FHWA asserted that, ``Nothing in this document directlypreempts any State law or regulation.'' 53 FR 22282. This statement wasbased on incomplete information. As stated further in the NPRM, ``The FMCSRsestablish minimum safety regulations which, at the present time, may besupplemented by the States, <T3>except for the adoption of inconsistent regulations.'' Id. </T3>(emphasissupplied).As pointed out by some commenters, several States have recently adoptedlaws or regulations which limit the ability of employers to drug test employees.The FHWA is aware that at least nine States and the City of San Franciscohave adopted laws or ordinances which prohibit certain forms of testingor otherwise limit the ability of employers to conduct employee drug testing.These laws, regulations, or ordinances, to the extent that they would precludemotor carriers from complying with the requirements of the FMCSRs, as amendedby this final rule, are preempted by these Federal regulations.Federal regulations have the same preemptive effect as Federal statutes.<T3>Wood v. General Motors Corp., </T3>673 F. Supp. 1108, 1113 (D. Mass.1987), <T3>citing Fidelity Federal Savings andamp; Loan Ass'n v. De La Cuesta, </T3>458U.S. 141, 153, 102 S. Ct. 3014, 3022 (1982). Federal preemption of Statelaws and regulations may take place in several ways. (For an excellentdiscussion of preemption see <T3>Wood v. General Motors Corp., supra, </T3>at 1112). In our view, theFederal laws under which the FMCSRs were originally issued (now codifiedat 49 U.S.C. 3102) and recently repromulgated (49 U.S.C. 2505), while notoccupying the field of interstate motor carrier safety so as to totallydisplace State regulation (<T3>but see, </T3>49 U.S.C. app. 2507, Review and Preemption of State Regulations),clearly establish, at a minimum, that State laws or regulations which actuallyconflict with Federal law are preempted. <T3>See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </T3>464 U.S. 238, 249, 104 S. Ct.615, 621 (1984).The FHWA and its predecessor, the Interstate Commerce Commission, havelong believed that the FMCSRs preempt inconsistent State laws and regulations,to the extent that such State laws or regulations conflict with the Federalregulations. <T3>See, e.g., Buck v. California, </T3>343 U.S. 99, 101-102, 72 S. Ct.502, 504 (1952). Accordingly, the FMCSRs have long provided that, ``Exceptas otherwise specifically indicated, Parts 390 through 397 of this subchapterare not intended to preclude States or subdivisions thereof from establishingor enforcing State or local laws relating to safety, <T3>the compliance with which would not prevent full compliance with theseregulations by the person subject thereto.'' </T3>49 CFR 390.30 (1987)(supplied). As part of its repromulgation of the FMCSRs, the FHWA recentlyissued a final rule to, among other things, renumber this section and amendit by striking the reference therein to ``Parts 390 through 397'' and bysubstituting therefor ``subchapter B.'' 53 FR 18042, 18055 (to be codifiedat 49 CFR 390.9 (effective November 15, 1988)). This change recognizesthat other Parts of title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations have beenissued under the authority of the Federal motor carrier safety laws referredto above, and with the same preemptive effect. The drug testing provisionsadopted today are incorporated in Subchapter B of title 49 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, and have the same preemptive effect.The ATA made two recommendations with respect to this preemption issue.First, it recommended that the agency amend proposed andSection; 382.101(b)to expressly provide that ``No State may adopt, maintain or enforce anylaw or regulation which actually conflicts with or stands as an obstacleto the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of the regulationsof this part.'' ATA comments of September 12, 1988, at 60. The FHWA declinesto accept this recommendation because it believes it to be unnecessaryfor two reasons. First, the agency believes it is unnecessary at this timeto affirmatively declare that no State may adopt such a law or regulation.States which have adopted these provisions have done so with more thanmotor carriers in mind. Accordingly, to the extent their laws apply toothers not covered by these rules, they remain unaffected by these rules.Second, the FHWA further believes that its preemption conclusion outlinedabove is expressly stated in Part 390 of the FMCSRs as discussed above,and that it is not necessary to restate this conclusion. We believe thatthe amendments made today coupled with the amendments which are effectiveon November 15, 1988, make this more clear than was the case at the timeof the NPRM. This rule does not in any way preempt State or local law enforcementofficials from requesting urine or blood samples from commercial motorvehicle drivers.The second recommendation made by the ATA was to revise proposed andSection;382.101(c) to specifically allow motor carriers to adopt more stringentregulations. The FHWA believes that this change is unnecessary since andSection;391.1(b) of the FMCSRs already states that nothing in these regulationsprevents a motor carrier from imposing more stringent or additional qualificationrequirements and examinations. 49 CFR 391.1(b) (1987). On May 19, 1988,the FHWA published a final rule that becomes effective on November 15,1988, and which would strike andSection; 391.1(b) and, in its place, adopta new andSection; 390.3(d) which provides that, ``Nothing in Subchapter Bof this chapter shall be construed to prohibit an employer from requiringand enforcing more stringent believes that this would permit motor carriersto impose reasonable additional qualification requirements and examinationsfor their drivers.The FHWA has carefully assessed this rule under the principles and criteriaof the President's Executive Order on Federalism (E.O. 12612, October 28,1987). For the reasons stated above and in the preamble to the NPRM, theFHWA believes that the problem of drug abuse, as it affects motor carriersafety, is one of national scope justifying Federal action. The agencybelieves that the limited preemptive effect of its adoption of this rule,as discussed above, is in strict adherence to constitutional principlesand expressly supported by statutory authority. Section 206 of the MotorCarrier Safety Act of 1984 expressly directs that ``minimum Federal safetystandards for commercial motor vehicles * * * (be established to) * * *ensure that_* * * commercial motor vehicles are safely maintained, equipped,loaded, and operated, * * * (and) the physical condition of operators ofcommercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate such vehiclessafely * * *.'' 49 U.S.C. app. 2505(a). Thus, the FHWA concludes that thisstatute expressly authorizes the issuance of preemptive regulations. TheFHWA further believes that the preemption which will occur is the minimumnecessary to ensure the achievement of a primary objective of the MotorCarrier Safety Act of 1984, <T3>i.e., </T3>to promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 391 and 394</ITAG>Controlled substances, Highways and roads, Highway safety, Motor carriers,Motor vehicle safety.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on November 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
