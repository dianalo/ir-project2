Self-healing systems are designed to ensure continuity ofservice in case of fire, earthquake or other disruption.Using loops of optical-fiber cable with huge capacity, theyare aimed at major corporations, government agencies andlong-distance carriers that need to move large amounts ofvoice and data traffic.</LP><TEXT>   U S West's plan underscores a new industry priority foremergency-recovery systems. Stakes have escalated since afire gutted an Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building inHinsdale, Ill., in June 1988, knocking out service to 35,000customers. A few months ago, a long-distance network collapseat American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. heightened the sense ofurgency.   Illinois Bell's parent, Ameritech, announced plans lastmonth to invest about $100 million over the next two years tobuild self-healing networks in seven of its major markets.ATandamp;T, meanwhile, is spending aggressively to strengthen thedigital &quot;backup&quot; of its network.   U S West's plans call for building separate fiber systemsto serve about 200 large office buildings and work complexesin Minneapolis-St. Paul; Denver; Portland, Ore.; Seattle; andPhoenix, Ariz. The undertaking represents the Denver-basedcompany's largest product announcement since the breakup ofthe Bell system in 1984.   &quot;This is really our bread-and-butter business. Ourcustomers can't afford even one minute of downtime,&quot; said BobHawk, president of the carrier and information providerdivision of U S West's telephone unit.   Mr. Hawk said plans call for laying a total of more than180 miles of fiber-optic cable to provide &quot;alternate-routeprotection&quot; in the five cities. Guarantees of uninterruptedphone service will be offered: If any outage occurs, thecustomer would receive one month of free service from U SWest, Mr. Hawk said.   For a single circuit with five miles of alternate-routeprotection, U S West proposes to charge about $626 a month.More elaborate circuitry designed to serve multiple locationsas a private network is likely to cost $25,000 to $46,000 amonth or more.   For example, International Business Machines Corp. hashired U S West to install a private version of theself-healing network at IBM's world-wide computer network hubin Boulder, Colo. The Boulder center links about 250,000computer terminals.   The structure of self-healing networks differssignificantly from that of the regular phone network. In aregular network, central offices are generally linkedsinglefile, like a string of beads. In such an arrangement,any major problem along the cable or in a central office caninterrupt telephone service down the line.   At the time of the Hinsdale fire, for instance, theAmeritech unit's switching station was equipped to shiftautomatically only 25% of its load to other hubs. Althoughrepair crews worked around the clock, service to someIllinois customers couldn't be restored for a couple ofweeks.   In contrast, the self-healing network links centraloffices with optical-fiber cable in loops, or rings. Centraloffices are equipped with a special switch that duplicatessignals and sends them simultaneously in opposite directions,ensuring that at least one arrives -- even during adisruption at a point along the ring.</TEXT></DOC>
