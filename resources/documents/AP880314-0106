Subsequent studies have failed to confirm that 2,4-D causescancer, despite a 1986 finding by the National Cancer Institutethat Kansas wheat farmers who mixed their own 2,4-D more than 20times a year stood an eight-fold greater chance of developing acancer of the lymphatic system called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, anagency spokesman said.   The study said home and garden users were not exposed to enough2,4-D to cause concern.   Sold under dozens of trade names, 2,4-D _ short fordichlorophenoxyacetic acid _ is believed the fourth most widelyused pesticide in the nation, with more than 39 million pounds ofactive ingredient sold in 1985.   The great bulk of that is believed to be used for broadleaf weedcontrol in wheat fields, though 2,4-D also is widely used onhighway rights of way, on lawns and in forests.   Despite EPA's decision, Chemlawn Inc., a major lawn carecompany, will not restore 2,4-D to its products until a specialNational Cancer Institute study of its employees _ of whom perhaps3,000 used 2,4-D on 80 or so occasions per year _ is completed,said spokesman Steve Hardymon in Columbus, Ohio.   Hardymon said EPA ``probably is right.''   But Diane Baxter, staff scientist for the National CoalitionAgainst the Misuse of Pesticides, said of the decision, ``I thinkit's outrageous.''   EPA, she said, appeared to have given great weight to animalstudies showing no cancer-causing potential by 2,4-D.   ``We only do animal studies when we don't have human studies,''but in this case a good study of humans _ the Kansas farmers _ wasdisregarded, she said.   Another chemically related herbicide, 2,4,5-T, ``was bannedmostly because of birth defects (among humans) in the PacificNorthwest ... and that (study) is not anywhere near as hard torefute as the study NCI did.''   EPA spokesman Al Heier, confirming trade press reports of theagency's decision, said Friday, ``It was a tough call.''   In addition to the animal studies that failed to show an effect,``I think there are quite a few (human) epidemiology studies'' thatalso fail to confirm the cancer-causing ability of 2,4-D.   Chemlawn says it knows of at least five human studies that showno cancer effect from 2,4-D. The company did not detail those, buta pair of studies of farm and forest workers in New Zealand isfrequently cited.   The first study found elevated incidence of non-Hodgkinslymphoma and another cancer called multiple myeloma, but did notexamine exposure to pesticides. The second study, however, found noexcess risk of cancer as a result of exposure to chemicals of the2,4-D class.   The herbicide 2,4-D aroused suspicion because it can becontaminated with small amounts of chemicals related to thedioxins, though there are no U.S. reports, and only one abroad, ofcontamination with the most toxic form of dioxin. That form ofdioxin is the most powerful cancer-causing agent ever tested in thelaboratory.   The contaminants of 2,4-D generally have only about 1 percent ofthe cancer-causing power of the most toxic dioxin.</TEXT></DOC>
