He has taught us that appeasing dictatorsdoesn't work, and now he's teaching us the folly of&quot;inspections&quot; to &quot;safeguard&quot; against proliferating nuclearweapons.   We can only imagine what Saddam must think as he watchesthe Inspector Clouseaus of the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) scour his country for atomic-bomb material theyhad assured the world only months ago he did not have. Whatstrange rituals these Westerners have. In a scene right outof the Pink Panther movies, the hapless inspectors first hadto watch outside a fence while Iraqis loaded trucks andescaped from one nuclear site.</LP><TEXT>   Now that they've been let in after President Bushthreatened the use of force, Saddam is dribbling out secretslike the Vietnamese disclose MIA remains, a little at a time.He's finally disclosed that his scientists had reprocessedspent nuclear fuel to make weapons-grade plutonium.   The IAEA claims to be shocked. &quot;This is a very seriousmatter,&quot; said Robert Gallucci, a U.N. inspector. &quot;Thefacility was under safeguards, but the activity was notreported.&quot; The Iraqis now say they began trying to enrichuranium as early as 1984, using at least four differentmethods.   They claim they never made enough for a weapon, but eventhe IAEA isn't as gullible as it used to be. &quot;There have beenoccasions when people have simply refused to answer directlya question or have not answered with what are full and frankresponses,&quot; said David Kay, the leader of the latest U.N.inspection team, last Friday. Saddam will probably continueto disclose just enough details to deter a U.S. air strike,and sooner or later the IAEA will declare itself satisfied.Then we're all supposed to be reassured.   Merely recounting this charade shows how much it violatescommon sense. We don't mean to be too hard on the IAEA, whichcan inspect only what it knows to exist. But that very factargues for a complete rethinking of the uses of inspectionsand safeguards. The point isn't merely that the Saddams ofthe world have been deceiving us; we've also been deceivingourselves.   Especially about what kinds of material are trulysafeguardable. Some things are simply too dangerous forsafeguards -- for example, large nuclear reactors or researchreactors. The Iraqis managed to make plutonium using both a&quot;safeguarded&quot; large reactor and &quot;safeguarded&quot; uranium; theystill weren't caught. IAEA &quot;safeguards&quot; succeeded only inmaking Iraq's dangerous behavior seem legitimate and harderto detect.   Yet, incredibly, the U.S. is now spending scarcediplomatic capital trying to persuade North Korea to open itsnuclear reactors to inspection. Apparently the StateDepartment thinks Kim Il Sung and his terrorist comrades aremore honest than Saddam. If Kim were smart, he'd invite inthe IAEA in return for loans from Japan and an end to theU.S. trade embargo. He'd still be able to keep hisreprocessed uranium. The fact is that it is remarkably easyfor dictators to develop nuclear weapons, as George Melloandescribes on the page opposite this morning (see &quot;GlobalView: How Do We Cope With Basement-Built Atom Bombs?&quot; -- Aug.12, 1991).   We'd argue that some regimes are too dangerous even fortechnology that might be safeguardable. Countries like Iraqand North Korea claim to want reactors for &quot;peaceful&quot;purposes, but both have plenty of other energy resources. Thepresumption about dictators must be that they havedictatorial designs; they should be denied even the mostbasic nuclear technology.   The U.S. also wants to enlist the world in a newchemical-weapons ban to be monitored by, yes, inspections.But inspectors can't be sure they're finding all of Iraq'schemical weapons even now that they have virtually free runof the country. No other nation will let inspectors havenearly as much access. Only an Inspector Clouseau couldbelieve a chemical ban will ever be verifiable.   It's also clear that U.S. intelligence will need a majorreorganization focusing on proliferation. In a sense, U.S.intelligence toward the Third World today is about where itwas in 1947 toward the Soviet Union. Only recently our spookswere startled to discover that Algeria is building a nuclearreactor with China's help. They still aren't sure what sizethe reactor is, though it's been under construction foryears.   Toward Iraq, the U.S. practiced the ultimatenon-proliferation policy, which was Operation Desert Storm.Since this is so expensive, it'd help if we prevented theproliferation in the first place. We can start byunderstanding that some safeguards just aren't safe.</TEXT></DOC>
