I am not sure that is correct,'' theambassador, Allan Ramsay, said in a radio interview from Beirut onthe British Broadcasting Corp.   ``I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by someleading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong termsthat there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is verymuch a crime against Islam,'' he said.   But, Ramsay warned, ``I do not want to raise release hopes and Ido not want to sound over-optimistic.''   The Iranian spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, onFeb. 14 called for Rushdie's execution for writing ``The SatanicVerses,'' which Moslems say blasphemes Islam. The Indian-bornauthor, now a British citizen, has been in hiding under police guardsince then.   The 46-member Organization of Islamic Conference this week calledRushdie an apostate, which under Islamic law is punishable by death,and demanded that the book be banned.   Asked about the release hopes for British hostages, Ramsay said:``We have been at great pains to stress that one need not affect theother _ that the hostage issue is essentially a humanitarian issue.''   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held inLebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists, including Anglicanchurch envoy Terry Waite, British journalist John McCarthy andteacher Brian Keenan, who has dual British and Irish citizenship.   American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest held of the 15 hostages. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Ramsay also played down suggestions that a car bomb blast Fridayabout 50 yards from the British Embassy in east Beirut was intendedfor the embassy. ``We had some windows blown out and one or twoother bits knocked off _ nothing very serious,'' he said.   The explosion, which killed 15 people, was the worst in the areaof the embassy for some time, he said. He said he was unaware of anyincreased hostility to Britons in Beirut since the Rushdie affair.</TEXT></DOC>
