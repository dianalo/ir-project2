 Early models scanned images at 16 levelsof gray and were built for the IBM PC's serial port.andP;  This required Mac usersto attach a sluggish serial-to-SCSI converter box to such scanners.andO;More-recent entries have been built for the Mac's SCSI port and scan at muchhigher resolutions.andM;We took a look at a couple of products in the midrange scanner market, theMicrotek MSF-300QS and the Data Copy 730GS.andP;  Both come from companiesexperienced in the scanner field and both are quite sophisticated.andP;  These twodevices produce 64-level, gray-scale scans at 300 dpi (up to 450 dpi for theData Copy) and include many features that are becoming standard in the Macscanner market.andM;Scanner primer.andP;  The latest Macintosh scanners typically include direct atSCSI hookup.andP;  The difference in total scanning time between direct SCSI andserial-to-SCSI connection is significant.andP;  What once required minutes isaccomplished in seconds.andP;  After you scan in, review and adjust your image ahalf-dozen times, the savings can be measured in hours.andP;  Both the Microtekand Data Copy scanners reviewed here have direct SCSI connectors.andM;Scanner software has also improved as manufacturers write applications anddrivers that more fully utilize the Macintosh interface.andP;  As often as not,older scanners came with software ported directly from the MS-DOS world thattypically allowed little manipulation of images after scanning.andP;  Theapplications included with both the Data Copy and the Microtek scanners allowimage editing.andP;  While the software may raise the price of the machine, imageediting is absolutely necessary for good scan results.andM;Most gray-scale scanners can also can images as line art or halftones.andP;  Theseformats use only black and white to produce an image.andP;  Technical drawings andtext fall into the line art category.andP;  Halftone scans vary the density of theblack pixels to simulate levels of gray, so any gray-scale image can also bescanned as a halftone.andP;  These formats use less memory than true gray-scalescans.andM;True grays are accomplished at a more basic level by assigning more than onebit of information to each pixel.andP;  Sixty-four levels of gray require six bitsper pixel.andP;  It pays to think ahead about which of the three formats -- lineart, halftone or gray scale -- best suits a particular job because as thelevels of gray multiply, memory becomes critical.andM;Savings grays.andP;  Only a certain number of gray values can be simulated bymodern black-and-white printing techniques.andP;  This number is certainly higherthan the 16 levels available on earlier desktop scanners.andP;  On the other hand,256 levels of gray may be overkill for the relatively low-quality printingtechniques used by most desktop publishers.andM;Compared with a traditional photographic halftone, raw scanner output doesn'tquite measure up.andP;  However, photo images must pass through several stepsbefore they end up in a magazine or newsletter.andP;  In the process, subtledistinctions are often lost.andP;  To readers, there may be no noticeabledifference between the traditional halftone and the computer-produced one.andO;Since the number of gray scales a scanner produces is directly proportionalto its price, consider the print quality of your ultimate output beforemaking a buying decision.andM;Another important consideration in buying a scanner is hard disk space.andO;While a full-page halftone or line art illustration takes a mere 200 Kbytes,a full-page scan with 64-levels of gray can occupy more than 8 Mybtes of harddisk space.andP;  You may need to purchase more storage along with a scanner.andM;Microtek MSF-300QS.andP;  The Microtek scanner is simple to set up and operate.andO;You simply plug the machine in and plug the accompanying SCSI cable into theMac.andP;  The cable comes with a terminator attached--a nice touch.andP;  A longerSCSI cable would have been nice, too; 18 inches greatly restricts yourplacement options.andM;The Microtek is bundled with two related applications, Digital Darkroom (seeMacWEEK, Sept. 27, 1988) and SuperPaint 2.0, both from Silicon Beach Softwareof San Diego.andM;The Digital Darkroom package includes two ways to scan images: a specialsoftware plug-in module and a desk accessory scanning utility.andP;  With themodule placed in Digital Darkroom's &quot;pouch&quot; folder, you can control thescanner directly from the application.andP;  The image area, resolution and scalefactor can be entered, and the resulting scan produces a Digital Darkroomfile.andP;  Digital Darkroom has many powerful and unique image-enhancingfeatures, and its inclusion with the Microtek scanner improves the value ofthe overall package significant.andP;  A driver for Letraset's Image Studio willbe bundled with the scanner soon.andM;The only fly in the ointment is that if an image is too large for availableRAM, it cannot be scanned at all using the plug-in module because the DigitalDarkroom scanning software doesn't support virtual memory.andP;  Therefore, a300-dpi, letter-size scan could not be input directly, since it would requiremore than 8 Mbytes of RAM (the Macintosh's current limit on System-accessiblememory).andM;The Microtek desk accessory, however, does allow images too large to fit intoRAM to be scanned to disk.andP;  It is a nice utility that allows the scanner tobe operated from within any application.andP;  A scan may be set as line art of orhalftone.andP;  While these images are not brought into Digital Darkroom directly,they can be saved as tag image file format (TIFF) files and imported intoDigital Darkroom, Super Paint 2.0 and almost any page-layout program.andM;A selection of 12 halftone options are available in the DA.andP;  Some options aredesigned to reproduce the original picture as accurately as possible; othersallow for special effects such as posterization.andM;Both the Microtek and Data Copy software too often force you to selectdiscrete values when they should permit any value within a given range.andP;  Forinstance, the brightness and contrast settings can be selected from a pop-upmenu, with each option a few percentage points different from the previousone.andP;  A more accurate and convenient approach would be to type in specificvalues or set them with sliding scales like those found in Apple's AppleScansoftware (see MacWEEK, Oct. 4, 1988).andM;Data Copy 730GS.andP;  The Data Copy scanner is one of the smallest and lightestof the page-size, flatbed scanners.andP;  Its low profile and small size make ittruly portable.andP;  The Data Copy also comes with a SCSI cable that is more than4 feet long.andM;The Data Copy is a simple to set up as the Microtek; you just attach thecable and load the software.andP;  Only one piece of software, MacImage 2.1, issupplied with the scanner, but its degree of sophistication is amazing.andP;  Forthose interested in the maximum number of tweakable options, MacImage is themost complete scanner control package available for the Mac.andM;For the less stout of heart, MacImage has a short menu option that containshalf a dozen predefined scan settings.andP;  These were all quite good andproduced fine scans.andP;  But it's the advanced program capabilities that willdelight the scanning aficionado.andM;MacImage's multiple features allow you to customize your image in hundreds ofways.andP;  Every setting has at least three options.andP;  Of course, you can set thescanning type including two &quot;HyperCard&quot; formats, which are misleadinglylabeled Line Art and GrayView even though they simply create 72-dpi ditheredhalftones.andM;The Data Copy can scan at variable resolutions up to 450 dpi, and, accordingto the company, this maximum is the true hardware resolution rather thansimply 300 dpi with digital extrapolation.andP;  At 450 dpi, though, memorymanagement becomes critical.andP;  One page-size image can weigh in at more than10 Mbytes.andM;If none of the given settings quite satisfies, the View Edit command, whichappears in several places throughout the program, allows an even greaterdegree of customization.andP;  For example, the Mode option specifies the numberof bits per pixel saved by the scanner, and the remaining options define thespecial formations of bits that will define each pixel.andP;  The separatepatterns can be viewed, and if a particular pattern isn't right, it can beedited by displaying it as a matrix of numbers.andP;  The numbers and the patternthey define can then be changed and saved to reflect any desired halftone.andM;Users may also change such complex variables as the gamma of the outputimage.andP;  The gamma is the relationship between gray levels in the scannedimage and gray levels output to paper.andP;  A linear gamma curve means that thegrays print exactly as they were scanned in.andP;  A logarithmic gamma curveshifts the grays toward lighter tones, making the printed image lighter thanthe original.andP;  The gamma may be displayed as bands of grays, as numericinformation or as a linear graph.andP;  The graph may be redrawn by hand, creatingcustom special effects, and numbers can be changed in the numeric graph tocreate more-precise effects.andP;  In an exacting production environment, thespecificity of MacImage is a real boon.andM;One problem with Data Copy's otherwise excellent software is that you can'tsimply drag the mouse to select the area of the page to be scanned.andP;  Thereare several predefined options, from full letter size down to 2 inches by 4.5inches.andP;  To get a custom size, however, you must choose the Frame command.andO;Most other scanner packages are more intuitive.andM;Several custom saving and printing options complement the scanning options.andO;A file format is provided for almost any application that might be using theimage, including bit-map, PICT, TIFF, RIFF, SuperPaint and PageMaker 1.2'sspecial Foto format.andP;  Printing options are provided for the number of linesper inch, screen angle and resolution of final output.andP;  A separate printingoption allows output to be optimized for the LaserWriter, LaserWriter II orLinotronic.andM;Conclusions.andP;  With software keyed to the same settings, the two scannersproduced virtually identical quality scans.andP;  Neither was difficult to set upor to operate; both were quick.andP;  The Data Copy's smaller footprint, muchlighter weight and long SCSI cable make it easier to handle on a crowdeddesktop.andP;  It also can scan at a greater resolution.andP;  But in manycircumstances the difference between 300 dpi and 450 dpi is not critical orapparent.andP;  Both scanners will do a good job for most desktop publishers.andM;Since he hardware produces similar results, the software is a more importantcriterion in deciding between these two scanners.andP;  Microtek's bundling ofboth SuperPaint and Digital Darkroom make it an excellent value for those whodo not already have those or similar products and who want to expand theirsoftware library.andP;  For newcomers to scanning, the microtek MSF-300QS totalpackage can't be beat.andP;  The software provided with the Data Copy 730GS isalso first-rate, but is clearly slanted toward heavy-duty scanner users whoneed special effects.andP;  For them, the Data Copy is the better choice.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
