And they don't like it one bit. The ancient cells arecrowded. Almost all the defendants reportedly are ill, withcomplaints that range from hypertension and diabetes tostrokes. Former Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov complainsabout the tea. And former KGB chief Vadim Kruychkov doesn'tlike the food.</LP><TEXT>   The wife of former Parliament head Anatoly Lukyanov thinksher husband is given junk food as punishment for notcooperating with the investigation. Now in the prisonhospital, he has trouble moving his left arm and leg.   In the old days, such humiliation would have receivedlittle sympathy -- and even less publicity. Prison sufferingwould have been swiftly followed by quick secret trials andexecution, or life imprisonment in a far-off labor camp. Butin the new Soviet Union -- or whatever it will be called --the accused coup plotters are quickly becoming a litmus ofjust how democratic and civilized the new government can be.   Amid calls for Russian republic President Boris Yeltsinand his co-rulers to bring about the &quot;velvet revolution,&quot;newspaper editorials have asked for leniency so that newgovernment officials won't come off like Bolsheviks orStalinists. Investigators and defense attorneys alike callnews conferences and provide interviews to give a fullairing.   The defense contends that the charges of treason againstthe 14 imprisoned officials are unfounded. They assert thattheir brief seizure of power was intended to protect thecountry against aspiring capitalists, and wasn't aimed atthose who wanted to maintain socialism. In the Soviet Union,treason carries the death penalty.   &quot;We hope that even in this country, it is possible to havea fair trial,&quot; pleaded Alexei Gofstein, one of the attorneysrepresenting Mr. Lukyanov, at a news conference yesterday.&quot;Ask to visit the jail and see the conditions there, you willhave less of a smile,&quot; he told reporters, adding: &quot;We willinsist on an open trial.&quot;   Henry Reznik, the lawyer for Yuri Plekhanov, the60-year-old former chief of the KGB guard, says in aninterview: &quot;In the old days, the court was just a decoration.We shall see now.&quot;   There is some irony in seeking democractic human rightsfor those who allegedly would have deprived the Soviet Unionof the many freedoms it had achieved under Mr. Gorbachev.Vasily Vlashikin, a legal expert at the U.S.A.-CanadaInstitute who helped write many of the reforms, has no lovefor the defendants, whom he calls &quot;those bastards.&quot; But evenso, he says, &quot;these trials will test publicly the changes tothe legal system made under Gorbachev.&quot;   One of the most important new statutes, he says, grantedjudges and lawyers new powers to prevent court-tampering andthe well-known system of &quot;telephone justice,&quot; where verdictsusually were arranged over the telephone. Only 18 months ago,contempt of court became a punishable offense, giving impetusto the rise of an independent judiciary and bar.   In addition, the justice system is now carefully watchedby what Mr. Vlashikin of the U.S.A.-Canada Institute hopes issomething approaching a completely free press. Publicopinion, too, demands openness, he says.   But he warns against too much optimism. The Soviet system,he says, still has too many flaws and even the changesamounted to &quot;three steps forward and two backward.&quot; He adds:&quot;Judging by American standards, any trial in the Soviet Unionwould be considered a kangaroo court because of things thatcan't be comprehended by the mentality of American judges,lawyers and the public at large.&quot;   Indeed, the fate of the defense lawyers hangs precariouslyon the winds of change. In many respects, they aren't off toa good start. Though the new law permits defendants to berepresented by an attorney from the moment they are arrested-- previously they couldn't be represented until theinvestigation was completed -- the lawyers for the coupdefendants complain that the press was able to interview thedefendants before they (the lawyers) were. They also assertthat they aren't privy to the facts of the investigationgarnered by the Russian prosecutor's office.   Alexsei Gologanov, who represents Mr. Pavlov, says hisclient's cell was searched and the handwritten notes of hisconversations with his lawyers had been confiscated. Theywere returned five days later. The lawyers also say theirtelephones may be tapped.   The Russian prosecutor, Valentin Stepankov, a 40-year-oldunknown appointed to his post last February, is also creatingsuspicion. The defense lawyers contend that he has beenleaking details of the investigation to the press. Andbecause Mr. Stepankov has complained that his telephones weretapped during the coup attempt, the defense believes he, too,was a victim and isn't objective enough to be the prosecutor.   Mr. Stepankov, at a recent news conference of his own,promised a fair and objective investigation and trial.   Separately, Mr. Stepankov appears to be seeking financialgain from the case; his office demands from members of theWestern press a $250 fee for interviews. The money, Mr.Stepankov says, will be used to buy badly needed supplies forhis staff.   It isn't known yet what kind of court will try the allegedconspirators. Mr. Vlashikin says Soviet procedural law wouldrequire a military tribunal, as more than one defendant has amilitary rank. Some attorneys wonder if the cases are headedto such a court because they are being required to havesecurity clearance in order to review the investigation,indicating military secrets are at stake. If the trials gobefore a military tribunal, they would probably be closed,removing any hope of a public airing.   But the matter may be open to negotiation, Mr. Vlashikinbelieves. He says that after the investigation, which isexpected to last two or three months, indictments will behanded up. Then the courts will decide where to hold thetrials. It could then go to the courts of the Russianfederation or those of the Soviet Union, as yet intact underthe reorganized government.</TEXT></DOC>
