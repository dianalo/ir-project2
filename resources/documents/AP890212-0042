(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   High-altitude winds forced apostponement Sunday of the launch the Air Force's new Delta 2 spacerocket with an advanced navigation satellite.   The postponement was announced just 13 minutes before the plannedliftoff after balloon data showed that shear winds several milesabove the launch pad were too high for the rocket to pass throughsafely.   ``We have scrubbed the launch of the Navstar mission because ofthe upper level wind conditions,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Forcelaunch commentator reported. Wind velocities were not reported.   The launch was rescheduled for 1:30 p.m. Tuesday.   Rand said a two-day delay was needed to provide rest for thelaunch team.   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 is to carry into space a $65million Navstar satellite that will enable NATO military users suchas ships, planes, trucks and tanks to locate their positions within50 feet. The accuracy for civilian users will be 300 feet.   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which haslogged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first ofthree new space boosters the Air Force ordered built to carrynational security payloads after the space shuttle Challengerexplosion in 1986.   The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Titan 34D rocket, alsoafter a 1986 failure, has left the Pentagon with a backlog of about40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation and other militarysatellites to be launched.   The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month,with the Atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch.   The Navstar satellite, orbiting 11,000 miles up, is to join sevenearlier model Navstars already on patrol. The Air Force goal is aconstellation of 21 of the upgraded payloads in orbit by 1992 toprovide total global coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
