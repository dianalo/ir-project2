Calculation of systems, containing coolants,separators, pumps, thermal power sources is provided. Heat exchange withouter space is estimated. Calculation of the regimes under system normaloperation and in emergency conditions including cases of arbitrary circuitemergency breaks is ensured. Software facilitating modification of theinvestigated system including its expansion at conservation of earlierformed data is provided. The results of the calculation of this processafter break of one of the loops of natural circulation of a two-loopsystem are presented. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
