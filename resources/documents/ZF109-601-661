(ASPG), Naples, Fla.andP;  &quot;Despitethat fact, they know they want it for their data centers.&quot;andP;  ASPG offers aDasd volume pooling product named Dasdtrak.andM;ACHIEVING SMS WITHOUT IBMandM;With or without IBM's DFSMS, many companies understand the concepts and haveachieved a system managed storage methodology suitable for theirenvironments.andM;&quot;We perform automatic backup and recovery using Innovation's [Innovation DataProcessing, based in Little Falls, N.J.] product line,&quot; said Honda Byhat,assistant vice president of System Software at Norex Leasing, an equipmentleasing firm in Burlington, Ontario.andP;  &quot;We utilize CA-Top Secret [fromComputer Associates International, Inc., Garden City, N.Y.,] to control dataset allocations on our production, test and system software Dasd.&quot;andM;Byhat and Norex Leasing are aware of the other available software solutions,but feel it is unnecessary to implement the IBM solution in the near future.andM;&quot;If and when we move in that direction,&quot; he said, &quot;we will continue to usethe Innovation products that are already in place.andP;  Even today though, we'vebeen able to provide a form of system managed storage.andP;  Obviously it's not aselegant but it controls and performs the required allocations, which is thewhole purpose of the methodology anyway.&quot;andM;Richard C. Turnbull, a systems programmer at Meridian Mutual Insurance inIndianapolis, agrees with Byhat: &quot;We've found that Dasdtrak [from ASPG]provides a very inexpensive method to implementing an SMS environment.&quot;andM;Meridian Mutual Insurance has not eliminated the possibility of implementingIBM's methodology.andP;  &quot;We'd continue to use Dasdtrak even with IBM.andP;  We'd turnoff Dasdtrak's pooling, but would continue to use the allocation limiting andreporting.andP;  We're more interested in limiting data set allocations than inpooling.&quot;andM;Turnbull added: &quot;We're not going to IBM's SMS right now because of the highercost involved with the process.andP;  Also, we think that Dasdtrak can go beyondvolume-level pooling.andP;  When we go to 3390s, we can provide partial volumepooling.&quot;andM;&quot;The people who have successfully implemented system managed storage haveplanned their migration,&quot; said Judy Johnson, manager of the IBM StorageManagement Center, Storage Systems Products Division, San Jose, Calif.andP;  &quot;Thechallenges of the migration were nontechnical.&quot;andM;&quot;The SMS approach, regardless of the products employed, is strategic insteadof tactical,&quot; said Rick Leopoldi, a senior consultant with Amdahl Corp.'sprofessional service department, Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  &quot;A proper plan isrequired from senior management.andP;  SMS requires its parameters.andP;  Theimplementation team requires a vast knowledge of the user data.andP;  It requiresthe knowledge of the people at the heart of the data.&quot;andM;Storage administration groups tend to exist solely in larger organizations.andO;In midsize to smaller companies, storage administration is often performed ona part-time basis.andM;&quot;SMS requires that operations personnel talk to the applications areas,&quot; saidGlen McDermed, program director of Enterprise Storage Strategies at theGartner Group, Santa Clara, Calif.andP;  &quot;Traditionally, that's not where theirstrength lies.andP;  Also, there often isn't enough people to dedicate to theeffort because of the multitude of tasks.andP;  It is a change in the way of doingbusiness for an MVS environment.&quot;andM;The effect of IBM's direction on current offerings from independent suppliersis continually debated.andM;&quot;There is no competition with DFP [IBM's Data Facility Product],&quot; addedMcDermed.andP;  &quot;Backup, recovery, reporting and other functions will remain anopen field.andP;  Yet, with the future moving in the direction of common storage,allocation management products could be exposed.&quot;andP;  (DFP occupies half thelines of code in MVS/XA.andP;  This component, along with the RACF, DFDSS, DFHSMand DFSORT components, comprise DFSMS, according to Xephon.)andM;Most software suppliers position themselves as complementary to IBM's DFSMS,and competitive with one or more of its related modules.andM;Sterling Software announced an architecture called Corporate StorageManagement in October 1988.andP;  This is intended to be a comprehensive solutionfor MVS users.andP;  The Storage Automation Management System (Sams) product wasannounced in February 1990; general availability was scheduled for September.andM;BUILDING ON IBM FOUNDATIONandM;&quot;Our initiative builds on the IBM underlying software.andP;  We accept IBM's pieceof this thing without any question,&quot; said Werner Frank, president of theseven-division Systems Software Group of Sterling Software, Canoga Park,Calif.andP;  &quot;Sams is an attempt to bring our existing client base up to speed andmove them in the direction of workstations,&quot; said Frank.andM;Sams includes the Automatic Initiation Manager (AIM) and View, a PC-basedgraphics-oriented user interface.andP;  Sterling's current storage managementproducts, DMS/OS and VAM, are included within Sams.andP;  According to a GartnerGroup report issued in March, &quot;AIM has significant structure andintelligence.andP;  The auditing-logging component attacks significant DFSMSweaknesses.&quot;andM;Sterling users can migrate to IBM components when they choose.andM;Phase two of Sams is being developed in a project code-named Eagle.andP;  Theproject mission is to take Sams into an object-oriented, realtime,multiplatform environment, where all the connectivity is from a workstation.andO;The platforms being addressed include IBM MVS and VM mainframes, DigitalEquipment VAX/VMS machines and IBM OS/2 machines.andP;  Availability is scheduledfor late 1991.andM;&quot;The first deliverable from Eagle will be announced in the next calendaryear,&quot; said Maria Smith, president of the Systems Software Marketing Divisionof Sterling.andM;LOCK ON TAPEandM;As ESA and DFSMS turn their attention to lower levels of the storagehierarchy--Dasd and tape--suppliers of tape management software will bewatching.andM;Because of its virtual lock in tape management software, Computer Associateshas been more than aware of the impact on 3420/3480 processing and has takensteps to introduce its CA-1 and CA-TLMS products to the system managedstorage arena.andP;  Similar to Sterling's Sams strategy, CA has incorporatedunder the CA-ASM umbrella a variety of automated storage management productsthat interface and communicate with one another.andM;&quot;We're not concerned about the next phase of IBM's plan,&quot; said CA's Sherman.andO;&quot;We're aware that tape management is such an integral part of the operatingsystem.andP;  Right now, we're in beta test with an NAS-compliant tape managementsystem for the VAX.andP;  [NAS is Digital Equipment Corporation's NetworkApplication Support.]  With CA-ASM2 and the VAX development, not only are wemultimedia, but we're also multiplatform.&quot;andM;IBM's Johnson said, &quot;There is some commonality between the MVS and VMoperating systems.andP;  And there is a strong desire to move system managedstorage beyond IBM platforms.&quot;andM;As independent software vendors open the architecture between their productsand provide interfaces between their own product lines, much concern has beenraised about IBM performing the same function.andM;System managed storage is driven by the DFP program, where both complementaryand competitive products interface.andP;  IBM has committed to retaining an openarchitecture for DFSMS, but many vendors are concerned about the literaldefinition of &quot;open architecture&quot; and microcode movement.andM;&quot;IBM's external products will use the interfaces internal to the operatingsystem,&quot; said Meehan of Innovation.andP;  &quot;There could be problems for some peopleif the microcode and the interfaces move further into the operating system.&quot;andM;&quot;There is some resentment toward IBM in the user community,&quot; said Prettymanof Empact.andP;  &quot;Some people feel that IBM is painting them into a corner by notoffering alternatives.&quot;andP;  According to Sterling's Wall, &quot;IBM must be carefulnot to impose a lot of restrictions that many data centers would not findacceptable.&quot;andM;INDEPENDENTS AT A DISADVANTAGEandM;Because IBM controls all the code, and because DFP knows no competitor,independent software vendors may be placed at a disadvantage.andP;  Additionally,some in the industry fear that IBM will redefine &quot;open architecture&quot; to meetits own requirements and provide a single, common external interface whilemoving more microcode into the operating system.andP;  Many feel that movement inthis direction may eventually cause the independent products to look andoperate identically, thereby removing all software options except for two:the IBM method and the non-IBM (but IBM-controlled) method.andM;&quot;IBM is big and controls software to a major degree,&quot; said Leopoldi atAmdahl.andP;  &quot;Sometimes it can have a myopic view of its software and theindustry.&quot;andM;In its report, the Gartner Group said, &quot;We continue to see no indication ofany IBM intent or capability of locking out third parties.&quot;andM;Courtney is a freelance writer and software consultant based in Bushkill, Pa.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
