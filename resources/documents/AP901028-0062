Or maybe bullies were your nightmare, orHalloween ghosts and goblins.   Today's children have the same fears - spiders and snakes, largegreen monsters and ``the dark.'' But they don't have to face thosedemons alone.   ``Not So Scary Things'' is a board game that guides childrenthrough the worst visions of their fears, debunking myths andallowing them to gain some mastery over life.   The game, available in some speciality stores and catalogs, isfor children ages 4-8 and their parents. It forces young players toimitate the objects of their nightmares and helps parents rememberchildhood perils.   The game ``mirrors the way children learn how to handle theirfears,'' said Dr. Neil Izenberg, a pediatrician and co-creator.``Imitate it, learn about it, then master it.''   As important as the child's reaction is parent participation.   ``We see parents who inadvertently frighten children becausethey don't have the same fears,'' said D'Arcy Lyness, a childpsychologist who created the game with Izenberg. She used theexample of a parent who takes a child to see a scary movie. ``Weforget what it feels like.''   Lisa Johnson, 28, of Philadelphia says she's played the gamewith her three children several times. ``They really get into it -the play-acting, jumping around and stuff,'' she said.   Her 6-year-old son, Derrick, used to cry and scream duringthunderstorms until he played the game. ``Derrick now knows whatlightning is,'' she said. ``Now it doesn't bother him.''   In the game, players move up Mount Courage along a path dottedby ``scary'' spots and ``courage'' spots.   When players land on a scary spot, they must pick a card, whichmay tell them to ``do a snake dance,'' ``make a loud thundernoise,'' or ``stomp like a monster.'' Similarly, a player landingon a courage spot must pick a card that might instruct: ``Show howto look a bully straight in the eye.''   The game's scary things are monsters, darkness, snakes,lightning and thunder, bullies and meanies, and spiders - fearschildren normally face while growing up, Lyness said.   Izenberg and Lyness spent 2{ years developing the game, runningideas past teachers, parents and children and getting help fromIzenberg's brother, also a doctor.   Recently, a group of children played the game at Albert EinsteinMedical Center in Philadelphia, where Izenberg and Lyness work.   Matthew Litman landed on a scary spot in the monster section.   Told to ``make a scary, monster face,'' the 6-year-old duckedunder the table, then popped up with his face scrunched togetherand his fingers pulling his eyelids up to his forehead, to the gleeof his playmates.   Later, he landed on a courage spot and was told to name threefamous monsters. ``Frankenstein, the mummy and the wolfman,'' heanswered after some thought.   Matthew said he was once scared by a neighborhood boy who wore amonster mask. Now, he knows that monsters are just kids ``dressedup scary.''</TEXT></DOC>
