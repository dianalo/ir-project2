Woolworth Co.'s stock soared almost $9 a share yesterday as takeover fever gripped yet another retailer.    A partnership led by Dart Group Corp.'s chairman, Herbert Haft, filed last month for federal clearance to buy as much as 15% of the retailer's 64.3 million shares outstanding, Woolworth disclosed yesterday.    Woolworth has an indicated market value of $3.48 billion based on yesterday's closing price of $54.125, which was up $8.875 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Woolworth said the board adopted a now common &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan to deter a coercive takeover. But Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said the anti-takeover measure &quot;is not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company on terms that are favorable and fair to all shareholders.&quot;    Whether the Haft family, which controls Dart Group, will try to acquire New York-based Woolworth is unclear.    A spokesman for the Haft partnership, which owns less than 5% of Woolworth, declined to comment on whether the March 18 filing under federal antitrust law foreshadowed a takeover attempt, friendly or hostile. The spokesman also declined to comment on whether the Hafts have discussed their plans with Woolworth management.    Analysts and takeover specialists questioned, however, the Hafts' resolve to win a war for the company should they launch a bid. In February, Dart lost its $1.03 billion bid to buy Stop andamp; Shop Cos. when the Boston supermarket chain agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. for $1.23 billion.    &quot;It's always unclear&quot; what the Hafts' plans are, said Eliot H. Benson, analyst with Ferris andamp; Co. in Washington. But the Hafts' interest in Woolworth continues &quot;their great desire to own a major retailer,&quot; the analyst added.    Woolworth would indeed be a prize. Analysts have applauded the company's move away from discount and variety stores after a restructuring that began in 1982, when it closed its Woolco stores. Since then, it has renovated about a third of its 1,140 variety stores and has won praise for its operation of more than 5,000 specialty outlets.    But analysts say that Woolworth isn't the most likely takeover candidate for the Hafts or another retailing suitor because the company -- despite being undervalued -- is well managed.    &quot;It's hard to see what (other retailers) could bring to the table,&quot; said Robert Buchanan, senior retail analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. He added that he didn't know of any retailers who might be interested in acquiring Woolworth.    Robert Raiff, analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., New York, said that &quot;Woolworth is probably worth at least $84 a share,&quot; citing its strong cash flow, stable fundamentals and attractive properties.    In the year ended Jan. 31, Woolworth's net income grew 17% to $251 million, or $3.81 a share, on sales of $7.13 billion. In the fiscal year, the retailer bought back 1.8 million shares for $65 million. The company's debt as a percentge of total capital is about 12%, analysts say.    Landover, Md.-based Dart, which the Hafts control, operates Trak Auto Corp. and Crown Books Corp., two discount retailing chains, as well as a financial-services subsidiary.    The family has been trying for about three years to boost its stature by jumping into a bigger retailing arena. Since 1985, however, the Hafts have been spurned by at least six major companies, including Safeway Stores Inc., Beatrice Cos., Supermarkets General Corp. and Dayton Hudson Corp.    Because of the Hafts' repeated failures to land their targets -- and because of the huge profits they have reaped by selling back their stakes in Safeway, Supermarkets General and others -- many investors and analysts have come to question whether they actually want to win a bidding war and acquire a company.    Wall Street sources have said, however, that the family still has about $400 million cash for acquisitions and could borrow additional funds.    ---                      Dart's Targets   Feb. 1985 -- May Department Stores. The Hafts buy a smallstake in the retailer, which they later sell.   May 1985 -- Jack Eckerd. The Hafts' Dart Group Corp. buysa 5% stake in this drugstore chain. A month later Jack Eckerdbuys it back.   Nov. 1985 -- Beatrice. Dart makes a last-minute $5.9 billion bid for the company, but loses to a $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out proposal from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   June 1986 -- Safeway Stores. Dart offers $3.9 billion forthe company, but is beaten by a $4.2 billion LBO arranged by KKR.   March 1987 -- Supermarkets General. Dart offers $1.7 billion for the company which escapes by going private in a $1.8 billion LBO arranged by Merrill Lynch.   Sept. 1987 -- Dayton Hudson. Dart accumulates 4.6 millionshares and bids $6.3 billion for the rest. But the retailer resists, and the October stock market crash halves the value of the Hafts' holdings. The shares are sold for a $67 millionloss.   Jan. 1988 -- Stop andamp; Shop. Dart puts the supermarket chain inplay with its tender offer, but KKR arranges a $1.23 billion LBO.   April 1988 -- F.W. Woolworth Co. The retailer discloses that a partnership led by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft filed for federal clearance to purchase up to 15% of its 64.3 million shares outstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
