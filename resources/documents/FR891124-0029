These regulations presently permit restrictionson title which limit the sale, lease or occupancy of a dwelling to personsbased on age, including prohibitions against the permanent occupancy ofthe dwelling by children. The regulations were designed to enable olderveterans to purchase homes in retirement communities containing restrictionson the age of persons who could own and/or occupy dwellings in the community.Under these regulations, the Secretary reserved the right to reject anysuch restriction if its operation would work an undue hardship upon theowner in the case of sudden, unforeseen events or be likely to result inan increased risk of default.Under the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Public Law 100-430, approvedSeptember 13, 1988, it is unlawful to discriminate in residential realestate transactions against any person because of handicap or familialstatus. However, the law provides an exception for certain age restrictedcommunities which meet the definition provided in the law for ``housingfor older persons.'' That definition is now contained in section 807 ofthe Fair Housing Act, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, PublicLaw 90-284, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq, as amended by Public Law 100-430. ``Housingfor older persons'' is essentially defined as including housing providedunder a Federal or State program specifically designed to assist elderlypersons and housing intended for and solely occupied by persons 62 yearsof age or older. It is also defined to include housing intended and operatedfor occupancy by at least one person 55 or older per unit, provided thereare significant facilities and services specifically designed for olderpersons, and at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at leastone person 55 years of age or older.VA proposes to amend andSection;andSection; 36.4253(b)(7) and 36.4350(b)(5)(iv)(B)to provide that age restrictions will be considered acceptable limitationson the veteran's estate in the property only if they are acceptable underthe provisions of the Fair Housing Act. This will assure that VA's homeloan program conforms to the requirements of the law.The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendmentswill not, if promulgated, have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C. 601-612. These proposed regulations simply conform VA regulationsto the requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b),these regulations are exempt from the initial and final regulatory analysisrequirements of sections 603 and 604.The Secretary hereby determines that these proposed regulations do notcontain a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation.They will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;cause a major increase in cost or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; orhave other significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Numbers are 64.114 and 64.119.These amendments are promulgated under authority granted the Secretaryby 38 U.S.C. 210(c), 1803(c)(1) and 1812(g).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 36:</ITAG>Condominium, Handicapped, Housing loan program-housing and community development,Manufactured Homes, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: October 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
