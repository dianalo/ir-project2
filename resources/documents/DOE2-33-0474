The nodules included four cavernous hemangiomas,four hepatocellular carcinomas, one metastatic tumor, and two regenerativenodules in cirrhotic livers. When the relevant part of the liver wascompressed during US observation, the echogenicity was reduced only inthe case of cavernous hemangioma. This phenomenon is considered to beunique to cavernous hemangioma.</TEXT></DOC>
