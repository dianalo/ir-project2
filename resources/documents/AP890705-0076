(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Louisiana Legislature, whereanti-abortion sentiment is overwhelming, went into special sessionWednesday, but abortion failed to make the agenda because of thestate's financial problems.   Gov. Buddy Roemer refused to amend his instructions for thesix-day tax session to include abortion in light of Monday's U.S.Supreme Court decision that allows states to place more restrictionson abortions.   He said there was too little time to deal with the subject butsaid he wants legislative committees to look at possible revision ofthe state's laws.   In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez said Wednesday he will call aspecial legislative session to consider legislation furtherrestricting abortions.   Louisiana's anti-abortion forces are so strong that the state isexpected to be among the first to tackle new abortion legislation.   Rep. Alphonse Jackson, a Democrat and a pro-choice leader,predicted that anti-abortion forces will be able to pass anythingthey want.   ``There is no question that the pro-life forces are in charge ofthis Legislature,'' Jackson said. ``They will prevail.''   Louisiana has laws similar to the ones in Missouri that theSupreme Court upheld on Monday, blocking the use of state money orfaciliites for abortions.   Unlike Missouri's laws, however, the ones in Louisiana remainedin effect during the challenge in Washington, so no abortions wereperformed at the state's charity hospitals or by state employees.   Since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling legalizingabortions, Louisiana has passed stacks of restrictive legislation,but only one other law has stood the constitutional test. Itrequires that parents be notified if their children try to obtainabortions.   Louisiana also passed a provision that all pre-1973 laws, makingabortions criminal, go back on the books if the Supreme Court everreverses Roe v. Wade.   Jackson, chairman of the House committee that would hear abortionbills, said the abortion issue cannot come up until the 1990 regularsession unless the governor calls another special session.   ``There are no plans for that,'' said P.J. Mills, the governor'schief of staff. ``He would do so if there was a public necessity.''</TEXT></DOC>
