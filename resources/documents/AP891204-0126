Along with Central America, the rivalry of the two superpowernavies, especially in the Mediterranean, surfaced as the mostpublicly divisive issue to confront President Bush and Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their storm-buffetted sessions.   Bush ruled out any immediate progress.   ``The chairman raised the question of naval arms control and Iwas not particularly positive in responding,'' Bush told aconcluding joint news conference with Gorbachev. ``We still havedifferences with the Soviet Union. He knows it and I know it.''   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney put it even more bluntly.``Naval forces are absolutely crucial to the United States,'' hesaid in a Sunday interview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''   ``We are a major maritime power. Our ability to reinforce ourallies in Europe is tied to our naval forces and we're notinterested in limitations on those forces,'' Cheney said.   A setting for fierce battles since the birth of Westerncivilization, the Mediterranean since World War II has seen manyengagements and confrontations among the 17 bordering nations andoutside powers like the United States and the Soviet Union.   The U.S. 6th Fleet, whose flagship the USS Belknap was Bush'shome for the summit, keeps 30 ships, 100 aircraft and 20,000 troopsat sea, operating under NATO direction in case of conflict.   Most of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid _ Egypt,Israel, Turkey and Greece _ border the Mediterranean. The UnitedStates keeps bases in four Mediterranean countries.   The United States has flown over the Mediterranean to bombLibya, shipped Marines through it to Lebanon, and interceptedairliners and ships carrying terrorists above and through itswaters.   The Soviet Union, on the other hand, has been steadilydecreasing its Mediterranean fleet to 30 or 40 vessels since 1985.Still, it regularly steams through the Turkish Straits with its twoguided-missile cruisers with nuclear capabilities.   One of them, the Slava, was anchored in Marsaxlokk Bay here forthe summit. Storm conditions prevented it from hosting Saturday'ssummit talk between the two leaders, as originally planned.   In the Black Sea, the Soviets are building the first helicoptercarrier of its class, the Tblisi. It is expected to sail throughthe straits into the sea sometime in 1990.   Those straits accommodate the flow of more than 50 percent ofthe Soviet Union's sea-carried Soviet exports and imports,according to U.S. estimates.   And Soviet Navy ships have been docking more regularly atTartus, Syria and even in Libya recently _ heightening U.S. concern.   Before arriving in Malta, Gorbachev used a state dinner in Italyto revive his year-old proposal for a nuclear-free Mediterranean.   His plan would establish a ceiling for naval forces of bothnations and their eventual withdrawal from the Mediterranean. Thiswould be accompanied by a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans.   Bush dismissed the proposal again by replying that armsreductions in the Mediterranean _ and specifically Italy _ couldonly take place if a global treaty were reached on conventionalweapons reductions in Europe.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Moscowwas likely to continue substantial financing for its submarineoperations to counter U.S. submarine-launched cruise missiles,which have a servicing base on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia.   ``The Southern flank is the weakest part of our alliance,'' saysProfessor Enrico Jacchia, director or Strategic Studies at Rome'sFree University. ``It is less important from the point of view ofthe concentration of Eastern and Western military forces, but it iscertainly more vulnerable.''   ``The United States and the Soviet Union, whether they like itor not, have a major role to fill in this area for a long time inthe foreseeable future,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
