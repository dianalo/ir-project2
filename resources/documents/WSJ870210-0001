GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST LATAMAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser and an important figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, was hospitalized after taking a Valium overdose, which police called an attempted suicide.    Detective Dan Waring of the Montgomery County Police Department said the rescue squad called to McFarlane's Maryland home yesterday morning told police that Mr. McFarlane had taken 20 to 30 Valium capsules. Mr. Waring said that, based on the amount of pills taken, the police department considers the incident an attempted suicide.    It is understood that Mr. McFarlane, 49 years old, recently has had back problems; Valium, a tranquilizer, frequently is prescribed for such an ailment. According to associates, the former national security adviser also has been under enormous stress since the disclosures late last year that the White House secretly sold arms to Iran in exchange for some American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian radical groups. Some of the proceeds from the sales apparently were diverted to Nicaragua's anti-Sandinista rebels, known as the Contras.    Mr. McFarlane has testified about his role in the controversy before several congressional committees, and he is expected to face further questioning.    A spokesman for Bethesda Naval Hospital said that Mr. McFarlane was admitted at about 8 a.m. yesterday, and that his condition yesterday afternoon was listed as &quot;good.&quot;    Late last night, a hospital spokesman wouldn't comment on the police report.    Mr. McFarlane's testimony before Congress on the Iran affair has been contradicted by other witnesses and by some White House documents. For example, Mr. McFarlane testified that President Reagan approved the sale of arms to Iran in August 1985. However, White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan told congressional committees that Israel shipped TOW antitank missiles to Iran in September 1985 without the president's knowledge or approval.    In another discrepancy, the former national security adviser initially claimed that reports that he carried a Bible and a cake to Iran on a secret mission in May were incorrect. He later said that his group did carry the cake on the mission.    Mr. McFarlane left the government in December 1985 and has testified that he didn't have any direct knowledge about the plan to funnel profits from the Iran shipments to the Contras.    Mr. McFarlane said he first learned of the Contra connection during the May trip to Tehran from Lt. Col. Oliver North, a former subordinate at the National Security Council who was fired in November for his role in the affair. Mr. McFarlane said he didn't notify White House officials of the disclosure. </TEXT></DOC>
