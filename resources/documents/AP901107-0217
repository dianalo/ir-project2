Walesa has also said he will step down if he wins Poland's firstpopular presidential election on Nov. 25. His main opponent is hisformer adviser, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.   Walesa told Solidarity's National Commission, meeting at itsGdansk headquarters, that the union will have to battle the newgovernment to protect its interests and he does not want to beaccused of seeking revenge.   ``The union will have to wage a fight and I do not want to leadthis fight so that people will not say that I am taking revenge,''he said.   Walesa was an unemployed electrician, fired for his politicalactivism, when he took charge of a shipyard strike that led toSolidarity's creation in August 1980. He has been chairman of theEast bloc's first independent trade union ever since.   Walesa is considered to be the front-runner in the six-waypresidential contest. If no candidate wins a majority, the top twovote-getters will compete in a Dec. 9 runoff.   Meanwhile, a government investigation into the former Communistregime's attempts to thwart Solidarity has uncovered a plot tokidnap Walesa and raid the Gdansk shipyard during the 1980 strikes.   The probe also found evidence that the Communist government hadbeen preparing for martial law as early as fall 1980, more than ayear before the crackdown. In October 1980, a list of activists tobe interned was prepared, including all the leaders of thethen-opposition, investigators said.   The secret police considered sending ``a police commando group''to Gdansk to kidnap Walesa and strike committee members on Aug. 27,1980, and bring them to Warsaw, Interior Ministry spokesmanWojciech Wroblewski said Tuesday.   The next step would have been to pacify Gdansk and the other twoBaltic port cities where the nationwide unrest was centered, hesaid.   The plan was dropped, and Walesa signed historic agreements withCommunist authorities four days later, legalizing the East bloc'sfirst independent trade union on Aug. 31, 1980.   The report from the Interior Ministry, now under the leadershipof a civilian for the first time in five decades, confirmed longcirculated rumors concerning attempts to suppress Solidarity.   Since the creation of the Solidarity-led government last year,the Interior Ministry has been overhauled. The secret police havebeen disbanded.</TEXT></DOC>
