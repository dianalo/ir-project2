The giant Swiss bank said it suspended Jay Buck, managingdirector and head of fixed-income operations. It also saidthat Lawrence Fell, fixed-income sales manager, will beleaving the firm. In addition, some lower-ranking staffmembers will be required to take courses dealing withcompliance with securities regulations. All are employed byUBS Securities Inc., the bank's U.S. securities subsidiary.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We had a clear violation of law and a clear potential fortarnishing the reputation of UBS; those who did it havesuffered the consequences,&quot; said Pierre de Weck, chiefexecutive officer of UBS's North America Group, at aninternal bank meeting, according to a spokesman. He addedthat Mr. de Weck emphasized that &quot;UBS will act only accordingto the highest standards of conduct&quot; to &quot;protect itsreputation, which is one of the most important assets of anyfinancial institution.&quot;   UBS named Michael Snow, a senior vice president in chargeof the bank's North American treasury operations and a memberof its regional management team, to succeed Mr. Buck. Thefinal disposition of Mr. Buck's case is still pending. A bankspokesman said Mr. Buck wouldn't be returning to his formerposition.   Kevin Cronin, who has held several senior sales managementpositions at UBS in the U.S. and abroad, was named head offixed-income sales. Both his and Mr. Snow's appointments areeffective immediately.   According to UBS employees, Mr. Fell and some other staffmembers arranged for investors to purchase Citicorp StandardCredit Card Master Trust I securities with the understandingthat UBS would repurchase them at a predetermined price.Along with Citicorp's Citibank unit, UBS was a lead managerof the $1.41 billion, mid-August underwriting, whichconsisted of fixed-income securities backed by Citibankcredit card receivables.   &quot;Parking&quot; of securities to create a transaction that isn'treal can be a violation of U.S. securities law.   The motive behind the UBS transaction, said UBS employees,was to ensure that the Citicorp securities were sold to atleast 100 unrelated investors, the minimum needed to qualifythem as eligible investments for U.S. pension funds under theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act. While Mr. Buck isn'tbelieved to have participated in the transaction, UBSemployees said he was aware of it. Neither he nor Mr. Fellcould be reached for comment.   A bank executive said that UBS discovered the allegedviolations in late August and quickly notified the New YorkStock Exchange and Federal Reserve Bank of New York. &quot;Therewas no financial damage to either the firm or any of itsclients,&quot; said the bank spokesman.   Securities lawyers pointed out that damages aren't aprerequisite for either Securities and Exchange Commission orBig Board action. They also said the Swiss bank could bepenalized for not adequately supervising its staff.   Still, &quot;if the firm takes prompt action, as seems to bethe case here, then the individuals would become the maintargets of any investigation,&quot; said Thomas A. Russo, apartner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft.   The alleged purpose of the transaction turned out to be apointless exercise. UBS already had the minimum 100 investorsneeded to satisfy ERISA rules, according to a bank executive.&quot;It was a tragedy&quot; for the people involved, he said, &quot;becausethey had the investor names they needed, but they didn'tknow it.&quot; He said that was because initial buyers of thesecurities had sold them &quot;downstream&quot; to others, and allpurchasers count towards the 100 minimum.</TEXT></DOC>
