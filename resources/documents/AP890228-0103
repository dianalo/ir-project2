After three hours of testimony before skeptical members of theHouse telecommunications and finance subcommittee, FCC chairmanDennis Patrick said the agency will vote on the ``rate cap'' planfor interstate services on March 16. He said it would go into effectJuly 1 if approved unless it is blocked by Congress.   Although committee members agreed ATandamp;T's rate structure should bechanged, several complained about the FCC plan and one said it couldmake the company ``an enormous profit-making machine.''   Patrick had postponed the FCC vote from Jan. 30 because of thecongressional concern, but he said he would not delay it further.   ``The questions asked by the committee were questions that havealready been discussed,'' he said after the hearing. ``We've madeseveral changes to satisfy their concerns and we'll continue todiscuss them. But the commission will consider the pricing matter onthe 16th.''   The proposal would change the two decades-old ``rate of return''regulation that allows American Telephone andamp; Telegraph certainspecified profits beyond its costs.   The new plan _ what Patrick called ``incentive regulation'' _would place a cap on what ATandamp;T could charge customers but wouldallow the telecommunications giant to keep any funds after costs asprofit. The plan did not make it through Congress last year, butPatrick is moving the changes through the commission byadministrative action.   Patrick's plan to press forward leaves Congress under a tightdeadline to act on the complex matter if opponents are to come upwith an alternative. And subcommittee chairman Edward Markey,D-Mass., said, ``At this point we don't have a consensus.''   Patrick told the subcommittee the change would spur efficiencyand ATandamp;T's ability to modernize and develop new communicationstechnology ``to the benefit of consumers in both the short and longrun.''   He said an FCC analysis showed the change would save customers$900 million over four years, with $700 million of the savings goingto residential customers.   But consumer groups contend the incentive would actually be forATandamp;T to seek higher-volume corporate business while raising ratesfor consumers.   Patrick outlined provisions that would limit ATandamp;T's ability toraise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look atother safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions``remain within the zone of reasonableness.''   But Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said that despite ``making a movein the right direction,'' the FCC had not done enough to protectconsumers.   ``I think they should not go ahead with the vote ... in view ofthe bipartisan concerns the committee has,'' Boucher said. ``I'd saywe would have price caps in due course. But under this plan, ATandamp;Tcould be an enormous profit machine.''   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, suggested the FCC consider requiringthat consumers share half of all the profits above a certain level,a proposal Patrick said the commission would discuss.   Under the plan Patrick outlined at the hearing, ATandamp;T would haveto cut overall prices by 3 percent over four years.   The plan would also divide ATandamp;T's services into three ``baskets''_ one group including residential and small business customers, forexample _ and allow only certain price increases or decreases foreach service.</TEXT></DOC>
