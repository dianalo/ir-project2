Although not a direct participant in the war between Iraq andIran, the United States sent warships to ensure freedom of shippingin the gulf. The Navy found itself committed to its biggest,costliest mission since Vietnam and by some measures since World WarI.   Between July 24, 1987 _ when the Kuwaiti supertanker Bridgetonstruck a mine while under U.S. escort _ and the Iraq-Iran cease-fireon Aug. 20, 1988, Navy ships and aircraft engaged in more than adozen armed clashes with Iranian forces and encounters with Iraqiwarplanes.   Officers say the gulf experience, which included the first combatuse of many computer and weapons systems, could lead to many changesin operating procedures, shipboard equipment and even a revivedemphasis on survivability in warship design.   It also is prompting a serious look at more subtle questions suchas stress. Sailors in the gulf were living under a constant state ofhigh alert and performing the technical tasks of missile warfare.Officers often had only seconds to make major decisions.   Official concern about stress was given special impetus by theJuly 3 disaster in which the missile cruiser USS Vincennes mistookan Iranian jetliner for a military attack plane and shot it down,killing all 290 aboard.   U.S. investigators said the pressure of first-time combat causedVincennes radar operators to misinterpret crucial computer data, andrecommended that stress and the ``human factor'' be studied forfuture training purposes.   Although investigators said the ship's ``Aegis'' radar-weaponssystem worked as intended, the system is being modified to feed moreprecise information on aircraft threats.   The Navy also has made or is planning changes in shipboardemergency procedures, damage control and fire-fighting methods as aresult of the near-sinking of the missile frigates USS Stark and USSSamuel B. Roberts.   Thirty-seven crewmen were killed on the Stark when it was hit bytwo Iraqi missiles on May 17, 1987, and 10 Roberts' crewmen werehurt when it was almost ripped in half by an Iranian mine last April14.   The gulf inspired the Navy's first use of computer systems totrain officers and crews for a specific combat zone. The computerssimulated gulf geography and tactical situations, with tapes ofactual radio traffic for added realism.   The United States had kept a small flotilla in the gulf since1949 but it quadrupled after President Reagan agreed in mid-1987 toreflag and escort Kuwaiti oil tankers menaced by Iran, whichconsidered Kuwait an Iraq ally.   The buildup ultimately reached more than 30 warships in theregion, spurring similar moves by five West European governments.   Gen. George B. Crist, head of U.S. Central Command and architectof the operation, said the 600-mile-long gulf, crowded with ships,oil rigs and besieged by warring neighbors, was a ``learningexperience'' for the Navy, whose strategies are built on long-rangeocean warfare.   ``It was a real do-it-yourself, come-as-you-are operation,'' saidCrist, whose Florida-based command controls U.S. military activitiesin the Middle East. ``There were no books, no doctrine.''   The Navy, for example, had not run an ocean convoy since WorldWar II, and the only officers trained for the task were civilianreservists.   Teachers, accountants and merchant mariners were recalled toactive duty as liaison officers aboard the Kuwaiti tankers.   Improvising for ``guerrilla warfare at sea,'' Crist hiredtugboats as temporary mine sweepers and leased two huge barges asfloating combat bases after Arab states rejected U.S. pleas to usetheir territory.   He said the barges, an idea borrowed from Vietnam where Americanforces patrolled from bases in enemy-held areas, showed it waspossible to range far afield ``without a tremendous baseinfrastructure ... and still project our power.''   U.S. officers say the ``mobile sea bases'' were instrumental indiscouraging Iranian shipping raids in the northern gulf for sevenmonths before the cease-fire. Their secret, night-flying Armyhelicopters also caught an Iranian minelayer, proving that Tehranwas mining gulf sea lanes.   Navy ships, built to fight submarines and aircraft, wereill-equipped to combat Iran's armed speedboats and Chinese-madeSilkworm missiles, considered the main threats to U.S. convoys.   Gulf-bound warships soon were being fitted with new firepower _machine guns, a laser-sighted Army tank cannon, and the radar-guidedPhalanx Gatling gun that hurls a storm of shells at incomingmissiles.   Even before the July 3 Airbus tragedy, some U.S. officers hadcriticized the choice of the billion-dollar Vincennes as being toomuch ship for the gulf. Aides say, however, that Crist stands by thedecision, which was aimed at countering an Iranian missile threat.   Some other ideas fizzled or never got started.   Navy helicopter mine sweepers toiled six months in the gulf'sgrueling heat and dust without finding a mine. Vietnam-era riverpatrol boats proved useless. Officials twice considered andabandoned the idea of calling in the U.S. Coast Guard.   Five dolphins trained in a top-secret Navy project to guardagainst underwater sabotage were sent to the gulf, but returned homeafter one died from a virus.   Crist said one of his biggest problems was a command structure inwhich the Navy's gulf commander answered to him, while some carriergroups in the Arabian Sea remained under Pacific fleet jurisdiction.   To solve the command split, Crist created a unified Joint TaskForce Middle East, directly under his headquarters.   He said that decision could serve as a model for avoiding futureinterservice rivalries in time of crisis.   ``If you look at it, this low intensity (warfare) is probablywhere we're going to be for a long time, and commanders have to beable to `think joint,' worry about the best the services can makeavailable, not the parochialism,'' Crist said.</TEXT></DOC>
