The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 299.63points, or 0.81 percent, ending at 37,173.70. It had lost 95.04points Friday.   The dollar closed at 143.22 yen, down 0.75 yen from Friday'sclose of 143.97 yen. It opened at 143.07 yen and ranged between142.85 yen and 143.23 yen.   Traders said the dollar opened sharply lower here as it wasbuffeted by a worse-than-expected showing of the U.S. grossnational product. It moved narrowly afterwards as market playersmade position adjustments, they said.   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday that the nation'sgross national product grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.   Some market analysts predicted that the U.S. Federal ReserveBoard would ease its monetary policy to counter the nation'sfaltering economy.   ``The market this week will try to see how far the dollar can godown,'' said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New JapanSecurities, Co. in Tokyo.   ``But the dollar already fell almost 3 yen from the 146 yenlevel last week, it is unlikely to fall further so quickly,'' hesaid, adding that the market is watching what U.S. Fed chairmanAlan Greenspan says in speeches scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.   On the stock market, the index rose as market players werereassured by the yen's strength and was also helped by index-linkedbuyings by speculative investors, dealers said.   But trading was inactive amid uncertainties over the directionof U.S. monetary policy, in addition to the major election hereexpected next month, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Co.   ``The Nikkei rose, but market players were just not in a mood toinvest,'' he said on condition of anonymity.   He added that the volume was unusually small for the first dayof February contracts. In stock trading, monthly contracts startfour days prior to the calender month.   ``The market has cooled down, and it won't change unless thesenegative factors disappear one by one,'' the dealer said.</TEXT></DOC>
