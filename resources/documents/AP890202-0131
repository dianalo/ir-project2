(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Runaway railroad cars derailed and explodedearly today, knocking out power to 37,000 people in and aroundHelena and forcing the evacuation of thousands in wind chills of 70degrees below zero.   There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48 a.m.explosion, which rocked houses up to three miles away, overturnedautomobiles and shattered windows in a nearby college and homes,officials said.   The explosion occurred in an open area near three major powerlines, and authorities believed at least one had been severed.Electricity was restored to all but half the city within 10 minutes.   ``It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said Ed Schild,undersheriff for Lewis and Clark County.   Firefighters fought a blaze near a railroad tanker containinghydrogen peroxide, which threatened to set off a second explosion,police Capt. Bud Carbis said. The fire flared up and spread to aboxcar containing plastic pipe, releasing hydrochloride gas, whichCarbis described as ``very noxious.''   Authorities urged ``everybody in town to stay inside,'' Carbissaid. Emergency workers were pulled back from the scene because ofthe gas and one paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhalingfumes, he said. Firefighters wore respirators.   Snow fell as firefighters poured water on the flames.Temperatures of 29 degrees below zero combined with winds to producewind chills of 70 below, the National Weather Service said.   About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students atCarroll College, were evacauted from a square-mile area around theblast zone, officials said. Evacuees went to churches, the HelenaCivic Center, the National Guard armory and schools, which werealready closed by the cold snap.   The blast initially knocked out power to all of the statecapital, which has about 27,000 people, and the surrounding HelenaValley, population 10,000.   ``Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said Mayor RussellRitter, who is also head of development for Carroll. ``There arechunks of rail cars blown from 300 yards away all over campus.''   Virtually all the windows at the college were smashed and stonetrim was knocked off the physical education building, Ritter said.   The explosion came after Montana Rail Link freight cars brokeloose near the Continental Divide while engines were being switchedon Burlington Northern tracks, railroad officials said. The carsrolled nine miles east and downhill into Helena, where they struck alocomotive and exploded, said Rail Link spokesman Terry Toppins.   ``I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said MikeMcNellis, who was aboard the locomotive struck by the runaway cars.   About 20 cars derailed, said Mike Lemm of Montana Rail Link. Oneof the cars contained hydrogen peroxide, another held alcohol andthe third was carrying an unknown liquid, according to the stateDisaster and Emergency Services Division.   Hydrogen peroxide is a corrosive and dangerous chemical, Toppinssaid.   The explosion occurred in an open area directly north of thecollege and between the city dump and city golf course.   ``If it wasn't for that golf course and the (adjacent) baseballdiamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said Lewis and ClarkCounty Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly. ``That really saved our bacon.''   About 300 Carroll College students and nearby residents milledabout the main floor of the National Guard armory, about half a mileacross an empty field from the college.   Students generally joked and laughed or dozed in groups, butolder people were somber.   ``It's funny to see what some people brought with 'em,'' saidAlex Lobdell, editor of the campus newspaper. ``There was a lot ofmakeup. One girl had her fishtank. And lots of people _ Helenapeople, not students _ brought their dogs. No cats, just dogs.''   The only injury reported at the college was a girl who suffered aminor cut on her arm, said Jeff Baker, vice president for academicaffairs.</TEXT></DOC>
