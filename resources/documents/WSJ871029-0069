Rose ViolatedBank-Loan Rules,Ethics Panel Says---By Brooks JacksonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rep. Charles Rose violated House rules by concealing several large bank loans totaling $101,496, the House Ethics Committee charged.    The panel also said the veteran North Carolina Democrat improperly borrowed $63,995 from his re-election committee, violating rules forbidding the personal use of campaign funds.    Rep. Rose will have a chance to defend himself at a hearing. Then the committee will vote on whether to send his case to the full House. It could recommend punishment -- including censure, reprimand or a fine. Rep. Rose said, &quot;I am confident that the committee will agree with me that no violations of House rules have occurred.&quot;    The charges come more than a year after the North Carolina Republican Party filed a complaint attacking Rep. Rose's campaign-fund borrowings. Based mostly on public records, the GOP alleged that Rep. Rose used some of the campaign money variously to make a deposit on some waterfront land and to purchase a jeep. Rep. Rose hasn't disputed that the money went into his personal bank account, but has claimed that his campaign owed him reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses from past campaigns.    The Ethics Committee's investigation, which didn't begin until June 17, uncovered more than the campaign loans, however. The panel said in its statement of alleged violations that Rep. Rose failed to make required disclosure of nine loans from six financial institutions, some as large as $20,000. Federal officials are required to disclose any debts exceeding $10,000. The committee said Mr. Rose's disclosure forms were deficient for each of the five years ending in 1985.    The panel also said it uncovered a separate alleged campaign-fund violation by Rep. Rose, accusing him of pledging a $75,000 certificate of deposit from his campaign committee as security on a personal loan from a North Carolina bank.    Rep. Rose repaid the loans to his campaign committee. The Ethics Committee didn't say whether the other borrowings had been repaid.    In a separate action, the panel said it was opening a preliminary inquiry into alleged payroll abuses by Fofo Sunia, a Democrat who is a nonvoting delegate to the House from American Samoa.    Earlier this week, the panel released a report formally &quot;reproving&quot; Rep. Richard Stallings (D., Idaho) for borrowing $4,800 in campaign funds to buy a used car for combined personal and campaign use, and for lending $1,000 in campaign funds to an aide. Rep. Stallings said he had been told by the Federal Election Commission that the loans were legal, but the Ethics Committee ruled that they violated House rules. Both loans were repaid. </TEXT></DOC>
