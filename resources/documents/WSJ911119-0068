The impact of the verdict in favor of Kent manufacturerLorillard Inc. is expected to be limited, however, becausethe jury found only that there was insufficient evidence thatthe plaintiff, Peter Ierardi, had smoked Kents during therelevant period.</LP><TEXT>   Having voted against the plaintiff on that thresholdquestion, the jurors never decided the broader issue: whetherasbestos used in Kent's &quot;Micronite&quot; filter during the 1950scould be linked to Mr. Ierardi's mesothelioma, a rare andusually fatal form of lung cancer believed to be causedsolely by exposure to asbestos.   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia by Mr.Ierardi and his wife, Angela, was the first to blame asmoking-related illness specifically on asbestos in a filter,rather than on the more general and inherent dangers usuallyattributed to smoking. Because Mr. Ierardi's suit involvedonly one brand of cigarettes manufactured for a short periodof time, tobacco-liability experts didn't expect that averdict against Lorillard would affect litigation againstother manufacturers.   But the case was viewed as important to other potentialplaintiffs who smoked Kents between 1952 and May 1956, whenLorillard, now a unit of Loews Corp., marketed Kents as saferthan other cigarettes because of its Micronite filters. &quot;It'sfrustrating when you put on what was apparently a very strongcase and the jury trips up on the question of whether theplaintiff actually smoked the cigarettes,&quot; said RichardDaynard, chairman of the Tobacco Products Liability Project,in Boston.   At the trial, defense lawyers for Lorillard, headed byDavid K. Hardy of the Kansas City firm Shook, Hardy andamp; Bacon,picked apart earlier testimony by Mr. Ierardi about when hesmoked Kents, thereby casting doubt on whether he smoked themwhen asbestos was used in the filters.   Mr. Ierardi, 56 years old, had said that he switched toKents in 1953 after smoking Kool cigarettes. But Mr. Hardyproduced a retired sales director for Kool's manufacturer whotestified that Kools didn't come on the market until 1956,thereby making Mr. Ierardi's account &quot;a chronologicalimpossibility,&quot; said Mr. Hardy.   Mr. Hardy maintained that the jury, at least four of whomwere cigarette smokers, was also favorably impressed byLorillard's second defense: that the amount of asbestos inthe Micronite filters was too insignificant to be linked tomesothelioma. Mr. Hardy and lawyers for maker of the filters,Hollingsworth andamp; Vose in East Walpole, Mass., interviewed theeight jurors for about an hour after the verdict yesterday.   &quot;We were very encouraged by what we heard,&quot; said Mr.Hardy. &quot;We think the second defense will prevail in thefuture.&quot;   Mr. Ierardi's lawyer, Daniel G. Childs of the Philadelphialaw firm Johnson andamp; Childs, is representing a half dozen otherplaintiffs who smoked Kents in lawsuits against Lorillard andHollingsworth andamp; Vose. He couldn't be reached for comment.   The tobacco industry has won most smoking-related lawsuitsagainst tobacco manufacturers to date, but dozens of suitsare pending. Most plaintiffs have blamed manufacturers forfailing to warn of the more inherent dangers associated withsmoking, particularly heart disease and lung cancer. But thefuture of those suits depends on the outcome of a casecurrently before the U.S. Supreme Court. The unresolved legalissue is whether federally mandated warnings on cigarettepacks that have appeared since 1966 effectively bar peoplewho smoked after that date from filing suits. The court isexpected to hear arguments in January.   ---   JUDGE ALLOWS PSYCHIATRIST to withdraw guilty plea insecurities-fraud case.   U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum also is reconsideringwhether to throw out the charges against him. Thepsychiatrist, Robert H. Willis, was accused of illegallytrading on inside information he obtained from patient JoanWeill, the wife of financier Sanford I. Weill, about Mr.Weill's business plans.   Mr. Willis pleaded guilty in June 1990 to securities fraudfor buying BankAmerica Corp. stock in early 1986 afterlearning from Mrs. Weill that her husband was seeking tobecome BankAmerica's chief executive officer. Mr. Willis, 52years old, of Tenafly, N.J., was scheduled to be sentencedtoday.   But in the wake of an appeals-court decision last monththat also involved the passing on of inside information by afamily member, Mr. Willis's attorneys claim that the caseshould be thrown out. In that decision, the Second U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the securities-fraudconvictions of broker Robert Chestman, although it upheld Mr.Chestman's conviction for insider-trading.   The Chestman opinion held that someone who trades on aninside stock tip can't be liable for securities fraud if theperson who gave him the tip didn't violate a fiduciary dutyin divulging the information. The court indicated thatwhether the tipper had a fiduciary duty to keep the secrethas to be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending insuch factors as whether the tipper regularly shared businesssecrets with the source of the information and whether therewas an explicit agreement to keep information confidential.   In a court filing, Mr. Willis's attorneys said that theindictment against Mr. Willis &quot;fails to allege facts to showthat Mr. and Mrs. Weill have a relationship which couldqualify under Chestman as a fiduciary or other similarrelationship.&quot;   &quot;In light of Chestman, what is charged is not a crime,&quot;said Lawrence Hirsh, Mr. Willis's attorney, of the New Yorklaw firm Spengler Carlson Gubar Brodsky andamp; Frischling.   In a court filing, the defense attorneys said, &quot;AlthoughWillis may arguably have breached some medical or ethicalduty he owed to Joan Weill when he disclosed what she toldhim, which we deny, his conduct doesn't constitute aviolation of {the securities-fraud law} as that provision hasbeen construed by the Second Circuit in Chestman.&quot;   The U.S. attorney's office maintains that the Chestmandecision doesn't require that the case be dropped. JudgeCedarbaum addressed many of the arguments now being made bythe Willis attorneys when she rejected a motion to dismissthe case in May 1990.   The motion to dismiss the criminal case won't affect Mr.Willis's settlement of a related civil suit brought by theSecurities and Exchange Commission. In settling that suit,Mr. Willis agreed to turn over $136,580 in penalties andalleged illegal profit; he neither admitted nor denied anywrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
