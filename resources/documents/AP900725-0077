The Aspen Institute on Global Change, co-sponsored by the AmwayCorp. of Ada, Mich., the United Nations Environment Program and theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, will bring leadingscientists together each summer in Aspen, Colo., to trade ideas.   ``This is not just another think-tank,'' Denver said at a newsconference, adding that saving the global environment is ``the mostimportant task that faces the human race at this time.''   Denver said an education and outreach program would try tobridge the gap between researchers and people who want to beinvolved in local environmental action.   William Nicholson, Amway's chief operating officer, said thedirect marketing company has committed $500,000 to the instituteover the next five years.   Rick Chappell, associate director of science at NASA's MarshallSpace Flight Center, said NASA contributed $40,000.   Chappell said that a possible project would enlist large numbersof students and others in simple environmental tests at points onEarth also being monitored from space as a way to check theaccuracy of satellite measurements of Earth conditions.   ``It would be the ultimate field trip for the kids,'' Chappellsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
