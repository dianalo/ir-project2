There are wider human and global interests thatshould not be ignored. The Soviet challenge can and must be met withoutthreatening first use of nuclear weapons or proceeding to develop further,even more destabilizing weapons systems. To remove the madness we donot have to trust the Soviet Union (nor they us), but we do require apolitical climate that challenges the entrenched positions of nuclearmilitarists on both sides. Such a challenge on the American side willalmost certainly have to be preceded by a powerful grassroots movementoutside the formal framework of politics; on the Soviet side the challengewill have to be mounted by a faction of the Politburo and then win widersupport throughout the command structure of the topheavy Soviet bureaucracy.In the end, more than challenging nuclearism is required. It will benecessary to work toward the adoption of new conceptions and structuresof security that rest on a mutal disarming process. Such a process cannotoccur unless realism can be divorced from nuclearism.</TEXT></DOC>
