(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Georgia's Republican convention adjourned inchaos Saturday after supporters of Pat Robertson shouted downspeakers and promised to hold their own meeting to pick delegatesto the GOP National Convention.   ``The business of this convention cannot proceed,'' said JohnStuckey, chairman of the state Republican Party. ``The 18 delegatesat large cannot be elected.''   Several hundred of the state delegates left the Albany CivicCenter after Stuckey's announcement, which he based on therecommendation of the credentials committee. About 750 statedelegates remained for the dissidents' convention.   Party dissidents quickly took control of the convention hall andselected   18 delegates, and then considered a party platform and debatedchanges to party rules.   Supporters of the television evangelist, who suspended his bidfor the Republican nomination last week, marched through theconvention hall and shouted down speakers on Friday. They won acourt order Saturday ordering the admission of delegates previouslydenied because of missed deadlines for filing paperwork.   Party leaders had disqualified more than 900 delegates to thestate convention, claiming they were chosen in improperly conducteddistrict conventions. Many of them were Robertson backers.   Stuckey said the several court orders issued in the delegatebattle made it impossible to conduct business in an orderly fashion.   He did not say how the party would select the 18 delegates, butsaid the 30 national delegates already named at districtconventions would meet at a local hotel to choose a nationalcommitteeman and a national committeewoman _ steps that were to betaken at the state convention.   All 48 delegates must vote for George Bush because of the vicepresident's victory in the state's presidential primary, butRobertson backers have pushed to win spots in the delegation toinfluence the party platform and the selection of a vicepresidential nominee.</TEXT></DOC>
