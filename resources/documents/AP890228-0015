(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Discovery could be ready forlaunch as early as next week, but a high-priority military rocketliftoff could bump the shuttle flight at least two days, officialssaid.   A decision on a shuttle launch date will be made Friday at theconclusion of a flight readiness review.   On Monday, Thomas Utsman, deputy director of the Kennedy SpaceCenter, said the center was ready for the Discovery flight, but hisstatement did not give a launch date.   Other officials said the launch target date of March 9 has notchanged.   Sources, however, said the Air Force has scheduled a militarylaunch about that time and that it would have priority over ashuttle launch for national security reasons.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration relies heavilyon Air Force tracking facilities for a shuttle flight. Air Forceofficials reportedly told space agency officials Monday they couldnot support a Discovery launch before March 11, later if themilitary launch is delayed on a day-by-day basis.   The nature of the military launch was not disclosed, but thereare two flights being readied: the first submarine launch of the newTrident 2 intercontinental range missile and a Delta rocket carryinga payload for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,''missile defense system.   The conflict will have to be resolved at the Thursday-Fridayflight readiness review, during which top-level NASA managers willexamine all aspects of the shuttle mission.   The Discovery launch had been scheduled for Feb. 23, but waspostponed after two tiny cracks were discovered in an oxygenturbopump in one of Atlantis' main engines following a flight bythat shuttle in December.   Because Discovery's three turbopumps went through the samemanufacturing process, NASA decided to replace them, delaying themission.   Five astronauts, commanded by veteran shuttle flier Mike Coats,are to deploy a large communications satellite and conduct medicaland technological experiments during Discovery's planned five daysin orbit.</TEXT></DOC>
