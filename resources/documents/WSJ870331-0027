Under a three-point plan announced yesterday by President Jose Sarney, companies that increase exports of manufactured goods by 10% from the previous year will be entitled to tax incentives on imports of production equipment. The plan also specifies that importers will no longer be obliged to obtain medium- to long-term financing to buy imports. Finally, companies will be allowed to use dollars without declaring their origin as risk capital when setting up new industrial plants.    Exporters said, however, that a large-scale devaluation of the cruzado will be necessary to increase exports. One exporter said that the cruzado is 25% overvalued. The dollar is officially priced at 22 cruzados.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said the new measures should help Brazil achieve its revised 1987 target of an $8 billion trade surplus, but said he had no plans for an early resumption of interest payments on $67 billion of foreign debt, suspended last month.    Brazil last week asked its foreign bank creditors for a 60-day extension on $15 billion in short-term trade credits and interbank deposits, which fall due today. That money includes $10 billion of trade credits and $5 billion of money-market deposits.    Details of the new plan were still being completed. But it appeared that businesses would be encouraged to use foreign exchange deposited in other countries to finance imports used in production.    &quot;We're going to dynamize our foreign trade, but not at the cost of an economic recession or misery, because the foreign debt must be paid with (economic) development and not through hunger,&quot; President Sarney said.    Last month, Brazil suspended interest payments on about two-thirds of its $108 billion of foreign debt. It said falling trade earnings left insufficient dollars to pay the 1987 interest bill, estimated at $8.3 billion.    Under current regulations, the central bank allocates Brazil's dwindling supply of hard currency to importers, but in recent months there have been insufficient dollars even for essentials. Businessmen complain factories are running slow for lack of parts.    Mr. Funaro said it is possible he will make a formal proposal for long-term renegotiation of Brazil's debt at the Washington meeting of the International Monetary Fund, which starts April 8.    Brazil will resume paying interest only when bankers agree to a multi-year debt restructuring that allows sufficient money to invest and keep the economy growing, Mr. Funaro said. </TEXT></DOC>
