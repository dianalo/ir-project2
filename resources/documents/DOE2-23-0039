Thevariation of track diameter with etching time has been studied and thetotal etchable range for different heavy ions in this detector has beenfound. The energy loss rate, dE/dX and range of these heavy ions in thisdetector have been computed theoretically using the methods given by:(i) S Mukherjee and A.K. Nayak (1979) and (ii) E.V. Benton and R.P. Henke(1969). A comparison has been made with the experimental results. (author).12 refs., 3 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
