Hahn said thatby filing the petitions on Dec. 31, more than $5 million in state taxes couldbe saved by avoiding a change in tax laws for newly incorporated cities. Theregistrar of voters randomly checked 5 percent of the names on the petitionsto see if any were not valid. According to state law, Hahn has 15 days tosupplement the list for any of the signatures that were disqualified.;    Hahnsaid she has about 20 volunteers working to get more signatures and hasalready collected an additional 500 signatures.;    &quot;We had 314 duplicatesignatures. Some people may forget they already signed the petition. Somepeople may be trying to sabotage our efforts,&quot; she said.;    Those supportingincorporation point to the need for autonomy over such key local matters aszoning, housing and city planning, as well as to combat expansion by Dublinand Pleasanton.;    A feasibility study released last summer said thecommunity could govern itself without a tax increase -- provided AlamedaCounty continues subsidizing fire protection. The county subsidizes about $4million of the fire district's $6 million budget. Even the most ardentincorporation supporters say that without the subsidy, they would not supportmaking Castro Valley the county's 15th city.;    But members of the countyboard of supervisors have said that as a city, Castro Valley would be expectedto pick up the fire protection tab. However, supervisors Mary King and EdCampbell, who were the most vocal regarding the fire protection issue,endorsed negotiations between the county and community to find an alternativeplan for funding the fire district so that Castro Valley residents would notbe overburdened if it incorporates.;    Castro Valley -- one of the largestunincorporated areas in the county and the state -- has been debating whetherto become a city since World War II. The last vote to incorporate CastroValley was 35 years ago, and it was defeated overwhelmingly.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FERNANDO QUINTERO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  425  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
