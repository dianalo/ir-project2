 Ofcourse, the truth is somewhere in between.andP;  Realizing the tremendouspotential for expert-system technology in mainstream business computingrequires a successful implementation strategy.andP;  I'd like to describe my viewson expert-system deployment strategies and relate my experience as the&quot;champion&quot; of this technology in a large telecommunications company.andM;One of the baby bells created from the divestiture of ATandamp;T, Southwestern BellTelephone Co. is a multibillion-dollar organization providingtelecommunication services in five states: Missouri, Arkansas, Texas,Oklahoma, and Kansas.andP;  The company has a remarkably democraticinfrastructure.andP;  On paper, it's a very tight hierarchical organization; inpractice, individual managers have quite a bit of flexibility in thesystem-mechanization processes they choose to implement.andP;  Technical managersand professionals in the company don't usually feel threatened by innovation,and many of them constantly try new things and bring new methods into thecompany.andM;While this management style may seem heretical to fundamentalists, it's a bigplus for technology infusion into a company, It fosters a style of change Ilike to call &quot;percolative&quot; -innovative practices and new ideas arecontinually germinating at lower levels throughout the company.andP;  Astutemiddle and senior management need only direct and apply the ideas fruitfully.andO;I was fortunate to get involved in AI, and expert systems in particular, inthis organizational climate.andP;  For me, the challenge was not to create aclimate for change, but to set some of the directions of the change and thestage for its future solid growth.andM;ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIESandM;Before a change as important as expert-systems technology can be managed anddirected, you need a strategy.andP;  Expert-system deployment strategies are bestunderstood as three models: strategic, &quot;AI soup,&quot; and infusion.andM;Strategic AI means using expert-system technology in one very focusedapplication and committing all your AI resources to it.andP;  While this strategyis quite tempting for its easy management and potentially large payoff, it isrisky.andP;  For every big, successful project such as DEC's XCON, severalprojects fail.andP;  However, this strategy was often successful in cases wherethe problem the expert system solved was unsolvable before, the project hadtremendous financial backing, and the payoff was a major strategic benefit tothe company.andM;AI soup is a term I coined to describe what too many organizations do withexpert systems: put significant resources-both hardware and software-into aroomful of people, stir it up, and hope something edible results.andP;  Thisstrategy rarely works.andP;  Lots of time and money are wasted, to say nothing ofthe bad feelings senior managers often develop toward expert systems whensuch a strategy fails to produce any significant return on the investment.andM;Infusion is my term for getting expert-system technology accepted into themainstream MIS organization as a systems-development tool that can and shouldbe integrated with other tools already in place, recognizing that expertsystems are especially good for certain potential mechanization tasks (orautomation, or whatever your company wants to call it).andP;  This strategy hasthe most potential for successful expert-system deployment.andM;EXPERT-SYSTEM JOURNAL: 1986-1989andM;The chronological experiences with expert systems that occurred in my companyfollow.andP;  I can't reveal proprietary information and will have to be sketchyin some places, but I'll try to give you an interisting, candid portrayal ofour expert-systems infusion strategy.andP;  My conclusion: a strategy to infuseexpert-system technology into your organization is probably the best one.andM;PHASE 1: AWARENESSandM;August 1986--The company embarked on a program to improve its awareness ofcertain technologies by assigning certain managers to be key technologytrackers.andP;  I was assigned the responsibility for AI.andP;  This move was the firstformal one committing resources to AI technology in the company.andM;September 1986-I prepared a 23-page white paper on AI and its potential inthe telecommunications business; the paper was published internally inDecember 1986.andM;October 1986-I networked with other companies in the area involved with AI,attended a local university's AI seminar, and joined a SIGART group.andM;November 1986-Purposely starting small and with an already established baseof users in the company, we procured and evaluated several PC-basedexpert-system shells including IBI's Level5 (then Insight 2+), Paperback'sVP-Expert, Arity's Arity Expert and Texas Instrument's PC Easy.andM;December 1986-Management gave substantial latitude in direction to thetechnology trackers, so I formulated a one-year plan.andP;  Consequently,management gave me approval to commit most of my time to championing AI andeducating the company's managers on expert systems.andP;  (Don't wait fordirection, set your own!)andM;January 1987-Expert-system technology was formally delineated as one of 50key technologies that the corporate MIS group planned to track, and my whitepaper on AI was distributed at the assistant vice-president level.andM;February 1987-I completed a bibliography on AI and expert systems withrecommendations on technical content and readability (invaluable for the nexttwo years).andP;  I also built a database of AI products in the marketplace.andP;  Thisdatabase was useful when managers challenged the merits of one expert-systemtool vs.andP;  another.andP;  It's no longer current or necessary, but the lesson is:be prepared technically.andP;  A PC-based demonstration application in Level5 wasdeveloped for seminars and presentations.andM;March 1987-I presented the first of many half-day internal seminars on AIfocusing on expert systems as a worthwhile technology and the applicable useof PC-based shells in the company.andM;June 1987-Temporarily assigned to the microcomputer support group, I learnedenough about their operations to design an expert system that could performmicrocomputer problem diagnostics.andM;August 1987-I attended the AAAI meeting, looked closely at several PC-basedshells, determined that you could wait forever for the perfect shell, anddecided to go with one choice immediately.andP;  (We were at the point where weneeded to legitimate expert-system shells by declaring one a standard: picksomething and run with it.)andM;September 1987-Level5 became a company standard, meaning we would support andrecommend it as the best choice for PC-based expert-system development.andM;PHASE 2: EARLY IMPLEMENTATIONandM;November 1987-While attending the first meeting of the Level5 national usersgroup, I met Ed Mahler of DuPont and discussed deployment strategies withhim.andP;  A major-application support group member was assigned part-timeresponsibility for expert-system development and began to work on an advisersystem for database access.andP;  Meanwhile, an MIS database expert presented apaper at GUIDE on his expert system for diagnosing database problems.andM;December 1987-The software portion of the microcomputer diagnosticapplication was completed and used in several demos but never deployedbecause it didn't have enough value for an already technically astute staff.andM;February 1988-One of our mainframe data centers wanted to developexpert-system aids, so we decided to deploy the applications under IBM MVSand procure our first mainframe expert-system tool.andP;  We deployed the systemon mainframes because the intended users had 3270 terminals and wereunfamiliar with PCs and the data center was spread over several floors in onebuilding.andM;March 1988-The company deployed a major expert-system application that washard-coded in C under UNIX, returning substantial savings.andP;  I wrote a paperon the microcomputer diagnostic expert-system design, emphasizing itsfeasibility for similar projects in other operations.andM;April 1988-I started a campaign to deliver knowledge about AI to interestedmanagers via E-mail notes and distribution of important technical literatureand demonstration materials to key managers interested or involved in AI.andP;  Ialso championed the formation of an AI steering committee that would preventduplicate software research and trials, promote expert systems in thecompany, coordinate expert-system activities across departments, and get moresynergy between those managers in the company currently involved inexpert-system projects.andP;  Mahler often talks about the usefulness of tappinginto the &quot;old boy&quot; network.andP;  This campaign was my means of doing so since Iwasn't an &quot;old boy&quot; in the company.andP;  The lesson here: it's important in thisphase to get a broader buy-in of the technology to prepare for the acceptancephase.)andM;May 1988-Four applications were deployed with the mainframe tool we wereusing, but we needed a more robust expert-system shell; our tool was awkwardand inadequate.andM;June 88-As part of our organization's end-user computing road show, I visitedfive company regional operations to talk about expert systems.andP;  To get the AIsteering committee up to speed quickly, I dragged them to a DCI seminar onexpert-system tools.andP;  (Get your early supporters trained fast.)andM;I initiated a series of 30 expert-systems presentations, ranging from talksto management groups (for example, internal auditors), divisional staffmeetings, publicized technical update sessions with open attendance, openforum bag-lunch discussions, and specific middle- and upper-managementgatherings, even speaking at a group Christmas party.andM;July 1988-The AI steering committee selected two final candidates for amainframe expert-system product; committee members visited the two vendorsand talked with several of their customers.andM;August 1988-We began the trial of a new mainframe shell and 12 people weretrained to use it.andP;  We also began development on a major mainframe productionexpert-system application.andM;October 1988-We began a column in our quarterly Business Computing Journalentitled &quot;AI News&quot; that focused on AI activity throughout the company.andM;November 1988-Up to this point all the Level5 users were self-taught, so webegan our own two-day Level5 classes.andP;  (We weren't happy with thevendor-supplied training and never found any outside training that suited ourneeds.) Coincidentally, I became an officer in Level5's national user group,Users.prl.andP;  (These groups are an excellent way to get people more attuned tothe technology's best uses and to make contacts with other companies doingexpert-system work.)andM;December 1988-We purchased Aion Corp.'s ADS, the mainframe expert-system toolwe had been evaluating.andP;  One of the mainframe application programming groupsdeveloped a sales and use tax system with the tool.andP;  We had originallyplanned to trial two mainframe products, but the first one met all ourrequirements and we purchased it.andM;PHASE 3: ACCEPTANCEandM;January 1989-The company's information-systems plan for the future waspublished; &quot;Maximize Operational Effectiveness To Be The Best-CostProvider-Implement Expert Systems&quot; was one of the key issues.andP;  The company'sposition was the strongest one yet on expert-system technology.andP;  We produceda video on expert systems to illustrate the use of the technology tononcomputer-literate managers.andM;February 1989-We developed a series of internal courses on Aion Corp.'s ADS,and our internal training organization took over the Leve]5 training-animportant step toward the next phase, intensification.andM;March 1989-We converted all our mainframe (mostly advisory) expert-systemapplications to our new expert-system product.andP;  Ed Feigenbaum's The Rise OfThe Expert Company was published and I distributed numerous copies to seniorMIS managers.andP;  I worked with the assistant vice-president for corporatemethods to explore hypertext and expert systems for corporate-methods workgroups.andP;  Around this time the interest in the video I was producing went fromapproval to anticipation.andM;April 1989-We began planning to develop a series of point-of-sale expertsystems for account executives marketing telecommunication services.andM;May 1989-The company's first knowledge-engineering class was held using anoutside consultant.andP;  Another mainframe application group proposed building anintelligent query optimizer for front-ending all our databases queries; theproposer had attended a Level5 class and realized what could be done with thetechnology.andP;  (At this point, we had three very large applications onedeployed, one in coding, and one in the design phase.)andM;June 1989-With about 30 expert-system applications in various stages andsizes, we decided to establish a group to aid other groups in launchingexpert-system applications.andP;  I promoted neural networks, completed a whitepaper, and made a presentation on the subject.andP;  I also made a presentation toa mainframe application programming group responsible for a major&quot;mission-critical&quot; system on the possibility of using embedded expert systemsto replace spaghetti assembly-code programs.andM;PHASE 4: INTENSIFICATIONandM;July 1989-We designed a complete series of knowledge-based systems courses: atwo-day introduction, two-day PC-tool, five-day mainframe tool, and four-dayknowledge-based systems design class.andP;  The systems design course includedknowledge engineering, acquisition, encoding, inferencing strategies, andintegration issues.andM;August 1989-Our first attempts to use an expert-system shell to replace anassembler batch program in a strategic application failed; performance wastoo slow to make the time window for the processing.andP;  (We didn't kill theproject but did defer it until the available mainframe tools become moreefficient.) The company's first neural-network production application wascompleted.andM;September 1989-We launched an intensive campaign to train dozens of MISmanagers in expert-system technology with the goal of getting the technologyaccepted in the company as regular tools.andP;  In addition to having developed afull expert-system curriculum in-house, we set up AI coordinators in all ourmajor application programming groups and in local user computing supportgroups.andM;October 1989-The first knowledge-based systems design class convened.andP;  Thiscourse was developed to provide the knowledge-engineering, acquisition, andintegration skills necessary to ensure infusion of expert-system technologyinto the mainstream MIS world.andM;November 1989-Management approved a prototype of the strategic application tofront-end all database queries with an expert system for SQL and systemresource optimization.andP;  I published a paper on the results of the earlyLevel5 classes.andM;December 1989-We began educating people on the boundaries and integrationissues between CASE and AI and the use of relational databases and expertsystems.andM;FOUR PHASES OF INFUSIONandM;As you can see from this chronology, it can take a long time for a largeorganization to assimilate major software-capability changes.andP;  However, wehad purposely decided that we wanted to implement the technology using aninfusion strategy because we wanted broad acceptance of it in the long run.andM;This process had distinct phases.andP;  First, the awareness phase from Oct. 1986to Sept. 1987: while apparently not much happened, this period may be themost critical because it's here that the direction for an expert-systemdeployment strategy is likely to be set.andP;  Too many companies have failed inthis phase either by funding the technology too rapidly (creating an AI soupstrategy by accident) or by totally focusing on one strategic application.andO;You should think about other important developments in software methodologiesin your company.andP;  How have structured design, joint-application design, CASE,relational databases, and other software technologies been implemented inyour company? What worked and what didn't? Revolutions don't occur in oneday-significant awareness of the concept exists before the revolution begins.andM;The second phase, early implementation, began in Nov. 1987 when individualswith my help or on their own) deployed successful applications.andP;  By May 1988we had about eight expert-system applications in various stages.andP;  By thephase's end in Dec. 1989, we had about 16 applications in various stages withexpert-system tools and technical support installed in all three tiers (PCs,minicomputers, and mainframes).andM;In the third phase of our infusion strategy, acceptance, the technology movedfrom being just another new technology to one of legitimate value-more thantwo years after we started.andP;  Managers at all levels had learned enough aboutexpert-systems technology to promote it properly.andP;  We had reached enoughmanagers (who learned about the technology from various sources) toconstitute a critical mass of enthusiasts and applications.andP;  Even a handfulof applications will suffice for this goal since many managers werecontinually encountering reports about these same applications.andP;  This phasewas driven by success stories, a broad range of middle-management support,and a proliferation of trade articles about expert systems.andM;The fourth and last stage, intensification, started in July 1989.andP;  For anorganization to reach this stage, expert-system technology must move into themainstream thinking (or corporate culture) of the organization.andP;  Thismigration will never happen without an infusion strategy; the necessary levelof support and funding will not occur simply because of some special AI groupor because a subgroup happened to complete one or two successful strategicapplications.andM;At this stage we started thinking more about leverage.andP;  Instead of helpingout expert-system initiators with any apparently suitable applications, weare now attempting to solicit more application proposals and support onlythose projects with the bigger payoffs.andP;  We are also exploring embeddingexpert-system functionality into traditional batch mainframe applicationswhere rule-based code has some documentation and ease of coding benefits.andM;THE END RESULTSandM;I can't tell you how much we saved thus far, but I know it is well beyondwhat we have expended in resources.andP;  Some applications in development willpay off a hundredfold.andP;  The company has hundreds of people trained in expertsystems-not as knowledge engineers but as knowledgeable managers who knowwhen and where to exploit this technology.andP;  We have a supportive andknowledgeable senior management.andP;  Expert-system technology doesn't have to besold here anymore; it's more a question of using it in the right places atthe right times.andM;Following a strategy to infuse this technology into your organization isvastly more fruitful than other methods.andP;  It takes more time, but theinvested resources will pay off in the organization's expert-systemdeployment success and for your credibility.andM;Tom Helton is a systems consultant at Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., St.andO;Louis, Mo., where he specializes in software technologies including AI,groupware, and object-oriented programming systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
