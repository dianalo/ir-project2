Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed report on the arbitrage business, including the profits of major firms and the total compensation for each firm's top five officers.    In a letter to SEC Chairman John Shad, Sen. Proxmire said that the increase in takeover activity may stem &quot;in no small part&quot; from arbitragers' efforts to launch takeover bids &quot;to generate more profit opportunities.&quot;    &quot;Last year, almost one major corporation a week was 'put in play,'&quot; Sen. Proxmire asserted. &quot;And at the heart of the hostile corporate takeover process has been the risk arbitrager.&quot;    The Banking Committee is examining whether investment bankers and arbitragers, who speculate in takeover stocks, promote corporate raids and whether they have become dependent on takeover activity for their &quot;current prosperity,&quot; Sen. Proxmire told Mr. Shad.    The recent arrests indicate that arbitragers are &quot;systematically involved in corporate takeover abuses,&quot; Sen. Proxmire said. Those arrested are: Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs and Co.; Richard Wigton, arbitrage chief at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., and Timothy Tabor, a former Kidder arbitrager and until recently head of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s arbitrage department. All three are free on bail.    Mr. Proxmire already has asked the SEC for summaries of all enforcement actions over the past five years against the 10 Wall Street firms most active in mergers and acquisitions and against their employees. The Congressional Research Service, meanwhile, is gathering data on how much investment bankers earned from hostile takeovers in the past two years.    In his Feb. 17 letter to Mr. Shad, Mr. Proxmire asked for a listing of all major risk arbitragers, their affiliations, their business volumes and profit levels for the past three years. He also asked the SEC staff to estimate the arbitragers' share of Wall Street's profits from takeovers.    In addition, the agency was asked to describe how the SEC, stock exchanges and Wall Street firms monitor risk-arbitrage operations and to assess the legal liability of any firm that fails to adequately supervise those operations.    At a hearing tomorrow, 16 chief executive officers, many of whom have been besieged by raiders, will appear before the Banking Committee to testify on purported takeover abuses and recommend changes in the tender-offer process. Sen. Proxmire is intent on building a bipartisan consensus for measures to dampen the takeover frenzy, according to aides. </TEXT></DOC>
