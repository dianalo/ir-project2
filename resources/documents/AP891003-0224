But, Jacobs said: ``I have every reason to believe that HongKong will come out of recent events fitter and more vigorous thanbefore. Ours is a city of survivors well used to living on theedge.''   Thousands of Hong Kong residents have sought to leave thecapitalist territory adjoining southern China since the violentmilitary suppression of a student-led democracy drive three monthsago in Beijing. By some estimates, emigration will rise 25 percentnext year to 55,000.   The Chinese Communist government's handling of the crackdownsuggested to many would-be Hong Kong emigrants that it will violatean agreement to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist way of life for 50years beyond the takeover in 1997.   The rising number of people seeking sanctuary abroad hasdepressed Hong Kong stocks and property values, caused a``brain-drain'' in many industries and raised pressure on Britainto provide refuge for those who want to leave.   Moreover, unease about Hong Kong's future has spread increasingdoubts about the territory's role as one of the most dynamic andproductive economic centers of Asia.   As part of his argument to dispel these doubts, Jacobs carried alist of 20 major international investments in Hong Kong since thecrackdown in Tiananmen Square.   Among them are a $667 million Citicorp loan for a high-riseoffice complex in which the U.S. bank will retain a 10 percentstake; a $1.34 billion loan from a consortium of banks to financeexpansion of Hong Kong's container port; a commitment from WaltDisney to base its Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong; and anagreement by Mobil Corp. to double its oil-terminal capacity there.   ``What has been the effect on our economy of the recent eventsin China and in particular Tiananmen Square? Surprisingly perhaps,the answer is not very great,'' Jacobs said.   He said although the emigration of talented professionals wasregrettable, ``there can be absolutely no question of our impedingtheir departure in any way whatsoever. What we have to do is toprovide the right sort of environment to persuade people to stay oreven to encourage them to return.''   The finance official was in the United States for talks withinternational bankers and business executives. American companieshistorically have been the biggest foreign investors in Hong Kongand their role there is deemed crucial for the territory to thrive.</TEXT></DOC>
