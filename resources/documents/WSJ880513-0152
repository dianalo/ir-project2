The patent was issued yesterday to Harvard University for the protein Cambridge Bioscience is using to develop the blood tests.    The patent covers a purified form of gp61, a protein found on the surface of the HTLV-1 virus. The virus is thought to cause cancers of certain blood cells and of the lymph glands. The cancers are rare in the U.S., but antibodies to the virus are found in an estimated 0.10% of the nation's donated blood, indicating the donors are infected with the virus, the company said. The cancers associated with the virus are &quot;endemic&quot; in Japan, the Caribbean and Africa, it added.    The protein was identified by a team led by Myron Essex, a scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health. The biotechnology concern said that it has genetically engineered certain fragments of the protein for use in an experimental blood test to detect antibodies to the virus. The company hopes to begin clinical trials with the blood test later this year.    The Food and Drug Administration hasn't yet approved any tests for screening blood for the virus, the company added.    Cambridge Bioscience stock rose 12.5 cents to close at $12.25 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
