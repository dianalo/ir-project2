Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., spoke out at a hearing focusing on theAdvanced Technology Program at the Commerce Department's NationalInstitute of Technology and Standards.   The program is designed to coordinate development ofemerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; fosterindustry, government and university partnerships, and monitorcooperation between federal and regional agencies.   But no money was allotted for the program in the fiscal 1989 or1990 budgets.   Walgren said that when the trade bill, of which the program is apart, became law last year, ``we had high hopes that finally ... wecan move ahead and provide the same kind of support to Americancompanies that is provided to science-based commercial activities inthe countries which are our greatest competitors.''   He asserted that ``if we do not modernize our thinking about therole of government and provide the American private sector with theresources they need to compete against the kind of competition whichis coming from overseas, we will, I'm afraid, miss out on the vastpayoffs which these technologies promise.''   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said ``the jury is still out''regarding what attitude the new administration will take toward theAdvanced Technology Program and other civilian high-technologyinitiatives.   ``Until we have a national science adviser and the president getshis team in place, we might suspend judgment, at least criticaljudgment,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
