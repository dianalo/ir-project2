To be good at enforcement, the IRS is learning, it must be good at economics, sociology, and curious facts. It hired University of Illinois researchers to study tipping habits of 13,000 households in 1986 to help judge the extent of waiters' unreported income. One finding: People ate least often in restaurants with Italian cuisine (2.5% of the time), but tipped the highest there -- 15.8%. Other tip averages: seafood, 14.1%; Mexican, 14.8%; Chinese, 15%; general menu (58% of the meals), 15.2%.    Between 1983 and 1986, as tastes shifted more to fast food, people ate less often in tipping-type restaurants, but the average tip overall rose to 15.1% from 14.6%. Yet there was quite a spread: For 30% of the meals, diners left tips exceeding 18%; 9% of the time, the tips fell under 10%. Tip rates generally were highest in the Northeast and lowest in the interior states.    But even the lowest averages, the IRS learned, were well above the 8% minimum that tax law requires restaurants to report for their employees.    CAN COMPUTERS GUIDE IRS phone aides to correct answers for taxpayers?    The 5,000 &quot;assistors&quot; answered 13.5 million phoned requests for help on tax law in 1988, with mixed results; the General Accounting Office figures 36% of the replies were wrong. IRS computer experts are working on two projects to help assistors do the job better and easier. One would eliminate the need to search thousands of pages of reference works by hand; it uses key words to retrieve information from data bases for display on computer screens. The other would radically change the method of determining what information is needed; potentially, it is far more effective -- and harder and costlier to develop. With a series of questions and responses displayed on a screen, the &quot;expert system&quot; would lead the assistor through an inquiry designed to discover a caller's real problem and the right solution. The IRS Boston district is to test the system in 1990.    AN INSURANCE TRUST'S estate-tax exemption survives an untimely death.    You can ease taxes on estates exceeding $1 million with an irrevocable trust; if it owns the life-insurance policy and satisfies other terms, the proceeds fall outside the taxable estate. But beware of complexities. One: The IRS argues that an insured person who dies within three years after a policy is bought remains its owner, making proceeds taxable. Now a Tax Court ruling for the estate of Eddie L. Headrick provides vital clarification, says adviser Sam Radin of National Madison Group, New York.    Headrick, a Cleveland, Tenn., lawyer, died in an auto accident in 1982, less than three years after a trust he created bought a $375,000 policy on his life; he had given the trust cash to pay the premiums. But Chief Judge Nims, with 17 concurrences, found that Headrick never had any ownership right to the policy; so the court upheld exemption from estate tax for the proceeds.    The trust worked because it was the original buyer of the policy and didn't hold policies that Headrick had owned and transferred to it, Radin says.    FOREIGN CORPORATIONS and individuals doing business in the U.S., but not resident here, must file returns by new deadlines or lose otherwise allowable deductions and credits, under proposed IRS rules. The cost may be severe for concerns that don't realize they must file returns, says Eli Fink of Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sells, CPAs.    AND YOU THOUGHT? Individual taxpayers spent less time working on 1987 returns -- 1.6 billion hours -- than they did on 1986 returns -- 1.7 billion hours, IRS researchers say. They credit tax revision's effects on deductions and other matters.    AFTER THE BALL, rental tuxedos have an economic life of only about two years, Treasury analysts tell Congress in their first required review of depreciable-asset lives. The rental finery now is part of an asset class assigned a life of nine years.    HOLDING BACK REFUNDS to pay non-tax debts is a job the IRS dislikes.    At agencies' requests, the IRS must withhold refunds and forward them to offset overdue family-support payments or non-tax federal debts, such as student loans. But the IRS worries that these offset programs may have long-term adverse effects on voluntary tax compliance. Its researchers studied what taxpayers did in years after their refunds were withheld for other debts. Now the researchers offer data suggesting that non-tax offsets lead to tax delinquencies.    First, agencies began giving debtors notice in 1985 that they could lose their tax refunds; that year, 47% of child-support delinquents didn't file returns, up from 27% in 1981. Then, the IRS found, 23% to 27% of all delinquents who lost refunds in 1985 either filed no returns in 1986 or filed returns showing tax due without paying all that they owed; such behavior was shown by only 11% to 12% of a control group of taxpayers who weren't subject to offsets.    The data imply that many delinquents start piling overdue taxes on top of other debts, the IRS says.    BRIEFS: Catherine J. Hill of Long Beach, Calif., who repudiated a settlement in Tax Court, must not only pay the agreed sum, the court says; she also must pay damages of $2,000 for frivolous arguments. . . . The IRS billed $8.2 million in added taxes to 26,000 taxpayers who failed to file Form 8283 for non-cash charitable gifts exceeding $500 in 1985; the assessments were 26 times the cost of the enforcement. </TEXT></DOC>
