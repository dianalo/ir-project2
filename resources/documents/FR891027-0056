Disposal began at the site in 1982. Pursuantto the lawsuit Town of Huntington, et al. v. Marsh, the United States DistrictCourt, Eastern District of New York found the 1982 FEIS deficient in itsdiscussion of the nature, quantities, and cumulative effects of disposalfrom site use. The Court also found that in accordance with a 1980 amendment(33 U.S.C. Sec. 1416(f)) to the Ocean Dumping Act (ODA) the FEIS shouldhave specifically applied the site selection criteria of the ODA (33 U.S.C.Sec. 1412) and Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR part 228) to this CleanWater Act site selection. the Court has ordered NED to Supplement the 1982FEIS to remedy these deficiencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Thomas J.
