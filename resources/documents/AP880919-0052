In a farewell speech at Maputo's airport before flying to Rome,the pontiff said southern Africa is a region ``where woefulviolations of human rights persist.''   He said each person should enjoy ``fundamental rights, withoutany restrictions or limitations justified by racial segregation orsocial discrimination.''   Officials of Mozambique's Marxist government, who previouslyhave denounced local Roman Catholic bishops for urging negotiationswith guerrillas, said the pope's visit would improve church-staterelations.   But activist clergymen from South Africa said the pontiff shouldhave spoken out more forcefully against their white-minoritygovernment's policies of apartheid, under which 26 million blackshave no say in national affairs.   The pope has ``given the South African government more comfortthan it deserved,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of theWorld Alliance of Reformed Churches.   He spoke at a news conference after he and other Protestantclergy from South Africa attended a papal Mass and joinedMozambican church leaders at a meeting with John Paul.   The pontiff began his trip in Zimbabwe. He also visitedBotswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and made a brief, unscheduled stopin South Africa when his plane was diverted in bad weather.   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was apropaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complainedabout the omission of their country from the official itinerary.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha greeted the pope,ordered a security force escort for a motorcade to Lesotho andlater boasted about South Africa's hospitality.   ``Anyone who enters into dialogue with the South Africangovernment must be aware that they are going to use you for theirown purposes,'' said Boesak.   One of Boesak's colleagues, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said thepope had met with officials who ``hurt us and cause us pain'' andhad been escorted by ``people who torture us.''   Chikane is secretary-general of the South African Council ofChurches, which is leading a civil disobedience campaignchallenging emergency regulations and apartheid laws.   John Paul spoke out several times during his trip against racialinjustice. He also condemned all types of violence and suggested hewas unenthusiastic about confrontational anti-apartheid strategiessuch as sanctions and election boycotts.   In Mozambique, the pope urged both sides in the country's11-year civil war to cease fighting and proposed a wordwide effortto rebuild the country.   ``With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' hesaid, urging Mozambicans to follow ``the path of dialogue andreconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood amongbrothers.''   The government, despite its opposition to negotiations,responded mildly.   Jose Luis Cabaco, a Foreign Affairs Department official, saidthe pope's appeal conformed with a government offer of amnesty torebels who surrender.   Cabaco also said the papal visit ``brought the government andthe church into joint committees where we had to look each other inthe eyes and talk, something we had not been doing.''   Civil war has left about 6 million of Mozambique's 14.5 millionpeople in need of foreign food aid.   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from theinternational community,'' the pope said. ``Let me stress theurgency of this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacificationand immediate aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
