Charles Rose, D-N.C., after concluding he improperlyborrowed funds from his campaign and then failed to publicly reportthe transactions.   Finding ``clear and convincing evidence'' of House rulesviolations, the committee also said Rose wrongly pledged acertificate of deposit from his campaign as collateral on apersonal loan; and failed to report liabilities to financialinstitutions on his financial reports, filed publicly by alllawmakers.   The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of OfficialConduct, wrote Rose that his behavior was ``deserving ofreproach.'' But the committee concluded there should be nopunishment by the full House because the eight-term lawmaker hastried to rectify his mistakes.   ``The committee recognizes and takes into consideration the factthat all funds borrowed were replaced in full without theinsistence of this committee, and that this action was taken by youprior to this committee beginning a preliminary inquiry,'' Rose wastold in the letter, signed by panel Chairman Julian C. Dixon,D-Calif., and ranking Republican Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina.   ``Furthermore, the committee recognizes that the campaigncertificate of deposit in question is no longer encumbered, due torestrictions placed on it in connection with your personalfinancial dealings.''   Rose said he was ``very happy that the committee found that nofurther action was warranted, other than the letter to me.'' Hesaid he did not expect the situation to hamper his futurere-election bids, and that the committee's decision not to taketougher action demonstrated it considered his mistakes technical innature.   ``I'm happy that it's behind me, I'm satisfied with the resultand I'm glad I can move on to total concentration on what thepeople elected me to do,'' he said in an interview. ``My head ishigh.''   A House rule restricts the use of campaign funds to bona fidecampaign purposes. The committee called the requirement ``crucialto maintaining public confidence in the fund-raising systemgoverning House members.   ``The use of your campaign funds, as alleged and proved, isentirely inconsistent with this principle,'' the committee lettersaid.   The panel said the personal benefit Rose received in eachinstance of borrowing, and the lower interest rate received fromuse of the certificate of deposit, ``are the kinds of abuses''House rules were designed to prevent.   ``For this reason, the committee instructs that you refrain fromany future campaign borrowings and-or use of campaign assets ascollateral,'' the committee said.   Rose said he was disappointed the committee did not accept hiscontention that money he took from his campaign amounted torepayment of loans. He said he apologized for signing his name tothe certificate of deposit, contending he hadn't known doing soviolated House rules.   Rose, 48, was first elected to the House in 1972. The stateRepublican Party first raised allegations about Rose's finances in1986. But Rose easily won election to an eighth term in the House,where he is chairman of the Agriculture subcommittee on tobacco andpeanuts.   ``I rather expect that the Republicans will be angry that thecommittee gave me the lightest possible action they can give,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
