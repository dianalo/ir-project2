He saidprevious contracts have been ratified with majorities as small as51 percent.   The contract, approved Wednesday, covers 66,000 hourly andsalaried workers in 15 states and mirrors job-protecting pactssigned last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. NoChrysler signing date had been set.   The Big Three contracts prevent layoffs except when productionis cut because of slow sales, forbid plant closings not announcedbefore the talks began and make it harder for companies to transferwork to outside companies or foreign countries.   The Chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lump-sum bonusesin 1989 and 1990, a $1,000 signing bonus and, for the first time,profit-sharing according to the formula that has generatedthousands of dollars for Ford workers.   Chrysler union worker's base wage is now $14.43 an hour; thecontract does not provide for a raise in base pay but does providefor cost of living adjustments.   But unlike the Ford and GM contracts, the Chrysler pact preventsexecutives from receiving bonuses in years when the profit-sharingformula generates no payout for workers.   The contract replaces a three-year agreement that would havehave expired Sept. 14.   Stepp said Chrysler workers are more militant than workers at GMand Ford and ``they're angry with (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacoccaand his high salary. They're really angry with Chrysler's attemptto transfer the K-car to Mexico.''   Iacocca earned $17.9 million in 1987, most of it by exercisingpreviously granted stock options. The figure came out the day afterthe April 18 opening of early negotiations.   Two days later, Chrysler confirmed it planned to halt U.S.production of its venerable front-wheel-drive K-car and supply U.S.buyers from a plant in Toluca, Mexico.   Both issues nearly derailed negotiations until Iacocca announcedChrysler would keep K-car production in Detroit through the end ofthe year.   Stepp said workers probably were disappointed with the $1,000signing bonus because they received $2,120 for signing a three-yearcontract in 1985.   The contract was rejected at several large locals, including theDetroit K-car plant, union officials said.   But at Chrysler's 3,500-worker Warren Truck plant, it wasapproved by 65 percent of those voting, said Local 140 PresidentGil Wojcik.   Two former American Motors Corp. locals in Wisconsin alsoapproved separate pacts Wednesday reached during the nationalcontract talks. Chrysler bought AMC in August. The pacts includespecial payments to workers at former AMC plants in Milwaukee andKenosha that Chrysler says it will close.   The Chrysler contract also protects 2,200 workers at fourclosing Acustar Inc. plants from layoff. Acustar is Chrysler'sparts subsidiary. When the plants close, workers will be paid theirregular wages and placed in a job bank for future hire by Chrysler.</TEXT></DOC>
