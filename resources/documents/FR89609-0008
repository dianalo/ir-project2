Subsequently,Airbus requested a change to the A320 type design to include non-traditionalcomputerized Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance presentation features.The Model A320 series airplane is a short to medium-range, twin-turbofan,transport category airplane with a seating capacity of 120 to 179 passengers,a maximum takeoff weight of 158,730 pounds, and a maximum operating altitudeof 39,000 feet.The manufacturer proposes to eliminate the traditional AFM takeoff performancecharts and replace them with reference to a computer program, or programs,and corresponding data files which would yield the same information. Thecomputer program proposal is ground-based and not related to onboard processingor uplinking. If the proposal is adopted, existing relevant regulations,e.g., andSection; 25.1587(b) of the FAR, would not provide adequate standards,since the required takeoff performance information would not be in a directlyusable form in the AFM itself.Under the provisions of andSection; 21.101 of the FAR, Airbus Industrie mustshow that the Model A320, as modified to incorporate the computerized AFM,continues to meet the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporatedby reference in Type Certificate A28NM, or the applicable regulations ineffect on the date of application for the change. The regulations incorporatedby reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``originaltype certification basis.'' The certification basis for the A320 consistsof Part 25 of the FAR, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through 25-56, andSpecial Conditions 25-ANM-23.If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations(i.e., Part 25 as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate standardsfor the Model A320 because of a novel or unusual AFM feature, special conditionsare prescribed under the provisions of andSection; 21.16 to establish a levelof AFM preparation and usage equivalent to that established in the regulations.Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with andSection;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by andSection;andSection;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis inaccordance with andSection; 21.17(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Novel or Unusual AFM Presentation Features</ITAG>The Model A320 series airplane will incorporate the following novel orunusual AFM features:Even though operators of large transport category airplanes have used performanceanalyses programs to determine regulatory compliant performance, the approvedAFM charts have been available to represent the official minimum certifiedperformance level of the airplane, as required by regulation. The currentprocess includes engineering review and approval of the charts themselvesas part of the type certification process. The availability of the chartsto airplane operators and FAA operations personnel for establishing theacceptability of alternate ground-based computer performance analyses hasapparently been a satisfactory means of providing information concerningthe minimum performance level of the airplane.Airbus Industrie proposes elimination of the takeoff performance chartswithin the AFM, and instead proposes to show compliance with the intentof the applicable requirements of Part 25 concerning the AFM by cross-referencing(in the AFM) to equivalent results via certified performance computer programsand data files. Airbus Industrie states that, in fact, the results wouldbe the exact digital images of the otherwise-provided AFM chart. The operatorscould generate equivalent ``AFM charts'' with appropriate interpolation/readingprograms, in addition to running analysis or gross weight optimizationprograms.Airbus Industrie intends at this time to still provide traditional enrouteclimb (driftdown) and landing performance charts in the AFM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>In current operational practice, neither flightcrews nor dispatchers usethe AFM on a day-to-day basis for determining limiting takeoff weights,field lengths, and speeds. Airline operations departments routinely reformatAFM source data into more usable schemes for specific airports, runways,etc. AFM charts are reviewed for accuracy and completeness, as part ofthe normal type certification process, prior to TC issuance. These dataform the master source of performance data which are used by all partiesto validate other data presentations. Federal Aviation Administration AFMmaster book libraries have been available to the public and other governmentagencies, such as NTSB and airport operators; therefore, the equivalentof current operational practice must continue if charts are to be removedfrom the A320 AFM.Applicants who plan to implement computer programs and data files as areplacement for the performance charts in the AFM are expected to obtainapproval from the FAA using the following process:a. All initial-release, individual takeoff performance entities (for aparticular airplane/engine combination) must be produced for the FAA inhard copy chart form (or table if appropriate) and included in a report.The report must be FAA approved prior to the AFM initial release in question,and will be used internally by the FAA to establish overall acceptabilityof the computerized presentation. This report will not be included in theFAA AFM ``master book,'' nor will it be included as part of the publicrecord. The ``master book'' level of performance will be that which resultsfrom execution of the program and data files located in the AFM. Subsequentperformance changes (e.g. same engine, but new rating) need not be producedin chart form, but the FAA certification office must have the capabilityto read and list the computerized performance modules referenced as AFMperformance.b. The report with hard-copy performance must have organization and identifiersto clearly relate specific charts to the performance determination process.c. The report should present performance data with the same completeness,clarity, and legibility as typical AFM charts. Graphical presentation ofperformance data is the preferred format. Tabular presentations shouldbe limited to simple relationships that do not require visualization topresent relationships, trends, or important variations in parameters.d. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that the FAA certificationoffice is provided with the equipment specification to use the computerfiles and any required initial instruction on use of the computer program.e. The applicant's total performance presentation to the air carrier mustbe such to allow that carrier to comply with andSection;andSection; 91.183(a)(5)and 121.141.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Notice of Proposed Special Conditions No. SC-89-1-NM for the Airbus IndustrieModel A320 airplane was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 10, 1989 (54 FR 10163). The followingcomments were received.One commenter points out that in the background paragraph, the statementis made that ``under the provisions of paragraph 21.101 of the FAR, AirbusIndustrie must show that the Model A320, as modified to incorporate thecomputer program * * *.'' This commenter states that since the AFM hasno interface with the airplane, the statement should read, ``* * * theA320 AFM, as modified to incorporate the computer program * * *.'' Althoughthe AFM may not be a physical part of the airplane, it is an integral partof the type design of the Model A320. Since it is the type design of theModel A320 that is being modified, and not the AFM per se, the commenter'sproposed change is inappropriate.Two commenters express concern over various items in paragraph a. of thediscussion. Both commenters question the FAA's intent as to which mediumwould constitute the AFM ``master book'' and suggest a partial rewordingfor purposes of clarification. The FAA agrees with these commenters. Accordingly,paragraph a. has been rewritten to reflect use of the electronic mediumas the ``master book,'' and its inclusion in the public record.One commenter notes the statement concerning tabular presentation of thedata is vague and should be clarified. The FAA agrees, and this statementhas been deleted from paragraph a., rewritten, and moved to paragraph c.where it is more appropriately located.One commenter suggests paragraph a. of the discussion be revised to allowmicrofiche and microfilm as acceptable forms of hard copy on the groundsthat tabular data could be voluminous. The FAA disagrees. Hard copy chartsare only required for the initial release AFM for a particular airplane/enginecombination. Volume is not a consideration.One commenter suggests deletion of the last sentence of paragraph a. whichstates the FAA must have the capability to read and list program performancemodules. This commenter believes that allowing access would also allowmodification of the data, which would contradict the requirements of SpecialCondition 2j. The FAA disagrees. The terminology ``performance modules,''as used in this document, refers to a data base extraction of performanceinformation for a specific configuration (flaps, gear, etc.), and not thedata base itself. The FAA shares this commenter's concern for program security,but in this case the referenced statement applies only to the ability toprint information from the associated files, rather than attempt alteration.Another commenter suggests paragraph d. of the discussion be revised tospecify inclusion of the program, and material related to its use, in theFAA approved AFM master book. The FAA agrees with identifying the computerprogram as the source of master book performance and has incorporated thisdefinition in paragraph a. of the discussion.One commenter suggests the addition of a reference to andSection; 25.1583(h)of the FAR to Special Condition 2 to cross-reference additional performancerequirements that presently exist in paper AFMs. The FAA agrees, and thisreference has been added.One commenter suggest the deletion of Special Condition 2b as it is irrelevant.The FAA disagrees. The intent of this special condition is to establishequivalency of electronic and paper AFM presentation media. If, for example,interpolation intervals were large, or computed field lengths were roundedoff to the nearest 100 feet, program differences could be generated thatwould be outside the accuracy available with the paper AFM. This specialcondition assures that consideration will be given to maintaining the samelevel of accuracy and resolution presently available with paper presentations,and avoiding a degradation in result quality.The same commenter suggests the deletion of Special Condition 2c, whichrequires two-way interrogation capability, as it is not a regulatory requirement.The FAA disagrees. This is an accepted capability in paper AFMs and wouldresult in degradation of capability if it did not exist in the electronicpresentation. Again, maintaining equivalence with the established utilityof existing paper AFMs is the issue.One commenter suggests clarification of Special Condition 2f by addingthe words ``approved limits of validity of performance data.'' The FAAconcurs, and this change has been incorporated.Another commenter suggests deletion of the requirement in Special Condition2i that certain performance information be hard copy only. The FAA disagrees.Certain information (as listed) must remain accessible in hard copy formin the AFM. This does not prevent the ultimate digitization of these chartsfor operational use, but the FAA does not want the AFM to be devoid ofthese charts as a result of computerization.Two commenters express concern over wording in Special Condition 2j. Onecommenter suggests changing ``protected'' to ``adequately protected,''and the other commented on the general inability to make any software 100percent secure. The FAA does not agree with the addition of ``adequately,''as this makes the requirement vague and subjective. The FAA does agreewith the concern that 100 percent security is unrealistic, but assumesthat alteration protection will be provided to the maximum extent possible.An evaluation of program security will be made as part of the AFM approvalprocess, and an assessment of its acceptability, or any required changes,will be made at that time.One commenter suggests a revision to Special Condition 21 to add a referenceto the computer hardware type. The FAA agrees, and has modified the wordingaccordingly.Under standard practice, the effective date of these final special conditionswould be 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; however, as Airbus plans delivery of the subjectairplane as configured to a U.S. operator in late May, the FAA finds thatgood cause exists to make these special conditions effective upon issuance.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> This action affects only certain novel or unusualAFM features on one model series of airplanes. It is not a rule of generalapplicability, and it affects only the manufacturer who applied to theFAA for approval of these features on the airplane.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Parts 21 and 25</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Special Conditions</ITAG>Accordingly, the following special conditions are issued as part of thetype certification basis for the Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplane.1.

In lieuof the AFM performance charts provided to comply with andSection;andSection;25.1583(h) and 25.1587(b) of the FAR, the following special conditionsapply:a. The system must provide the performance information which is requiredto be provided by the applicable provisions of Part 25 of the FAR concerningthe content of Airplane Flight Manuals.b. Interpolation, reading intervals, or round-off conditions must not resultin any more significant variation than for current chart reading.c.

Approved data must be clearly marked and segregated from unapproved(e.g., advisory) data.f. Improper extrapolations or solutions outside of approved limits of validityof performance data must be precluded. A note must be added to the AFMperformance section, where reference is made to computerized performance,to read essentially as follows: ``The various gross weight, operational,and environmental limitations provided in the limitations section of theAFM take precedence over what otherwise may be listed as approved performanceresults from the computerized output.''g. Program performance output must be compatible with Configuration DeviationList (CDL) or Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) applications.h. Suitable program usage documentation must be available to all users,including FAA certification and operations personnel.i. Special performance charts such as thrust setting, stall speeds, stabilizertrim setting, and position error corrections must not be included in thecomputer-for-chart replacement process.j. The program must be protected from inadvertent alteration, or deliberatealteration outside of an FAA-approved revision process.k. All computerized performance software programs must be properly identifiedby a reference number which must be revised for each change in the data.l. The program documentation must also identify the computer operatingsystem and type of computer hardware for which the software is intended.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Seattle, Washington, on May 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Leroy A.
