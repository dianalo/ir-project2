Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BTI FGRP STPL Y EUROP MDEST LABOR </CO><IN> INS TNM FND </IN><TEXT>   B.A.T Industries PLC is showing the world why the giant U.S. insurance industry, with $350 billion in annual revenue, has remained virtually immune to the epidemic of hostile takeover bids that has swept the nation in the past decade.    The reason is state regulation. To buy shares in its $4.5 billion hostile tender offer for Farmers Group Inc., the nation's third-largest auto and homeowner insurer, London-based B.A.T needs approval from insurance regulators in nine states. That's because Farmers has insurance units with headquarters in those states, and state laws require advance permission to buy a stake of 10% or more in the parent of any insurer.    So top executives of B.A.T, a tobacco, retailing and financial services giant, have been going hat in hand to places such as Boise, Idaho, to seek regulators' blessing for their bid.    In the process, B.A.T's executives have been grilled about such diverse subjects as the company's research into the potential health hazards of cigarette smoking and its operations in South Africa, as well as its plans for operating Los Angeles-based Farmers.    B.A.T executives say they weren't surprised by most of the obstacles that Farmers has thrown in their path, although they still hope Farmers will stop fighting and negotiate a friendly transaction.    If B.A.T's bid succeeds, it is likely to encourage other acquirers to mount hostile bids for other U.S. insurers.    But B.A.T learned painfully last week how arcane insurance laws can trip up a hostile bid when California's insurance commissioner rejected B.A.T's application based on a law banning government-owned insurance companies from operating in the state.    B.A.T has about 1.5 billion shares outstanding, which are traded on exchanges in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, and denies that it is in any sense government-owned. But the governments of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait each own less than 1% of B.A.T's shares, and various government employee pension funds in the United Kingdom own less than 2% each. Citing those holdings, which total more than 10% of B.A.T's shares, Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie ruled late Friday against B.A.T.    B.A.T says it will challenge Mrs. Gillespie's ruling in court, and hopes to prevail within several weeks. But attorneys for Farmers contend that appeals on the issue could take as long as a year. Investors certainly viewed the ruling as a big setback for B.A.T's $63-a-share bid, sending Farmers shares down $5.25 to $56.75 in national over-the-counter trading of more than two million shares Monday. Yesterday, Farmers shares gained 25 cents to close at $57, on volume of more than 1.4 million shares.    The long and increasingly bitter struggle shows why so few hostile bids involving insurance companies are attempted, according to lawyers, investment bankers and industry consultants.    &quot;There's no question that {the state regulatory system} does have a deterrent effect,&quot; says Bruce Bunner, a former California insurance commissioner who is a partner in the auditing and consulting firm of Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. &quot;I'm sure that some of my actions deterred companies from using hostile bids.&quot;    Mr. Bunner notes that regulators' powers are intended to protect policyholders. But he concedes that some company managements, when fighting a takeover, use those laws intended to protect policyholders to protect their own interests. &quot;They're going to play up the policyholder issues to preclude {a takeover} from happening,&quot; he says. &quot;All you have to do is have an insurance company sitting there {as a subsidiary} to avoid a takeover.&quot;    Farmers is the only major insurance company that has become the object of a hostile takeover bid in recent years, lawyers and investment bankers say. Currently, St. Paul Cos. of St. Paul, Minn., is resisting a bid by New York-based Alleghany Corp., a title insurance and steel company, but Alleghany is only seeking to raise its stake to 20% from 8.4%.    Insurance regulators sometimes have become involved in bids for companies whose primary businesses were in other fields, but which owned at least one insurance unit. The most celebrated example was the 1984 bid by Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, for Continental Group, a paper and packaging company that owned a life insurer based in Virginia.    Continental brought out details of Sir James's personal life at the Virginia hearings, including a tale of how he once commuted by speedboat between his wife and his mistress, whom he had lodged in separate vacation homes on the Mediterranean. The Virginia insurance commissioner didn't stop Sir James, but he was outbid by Kiewit-Murdoch Investment Corp.    The battle between B.A.T and Farmers also highlights the insurance industry's protection against takeovers at a time when takeover barriers in other fields, such as broadcasting and banking, are falling. The Federal Reserve Board, for example, which was once thought to frown on hostile bids, recently approved a hostile bid by Bank of New York Co. for Irving Bank Corp.    And other suitors interested in bidding for U.S. insurance companies are closely watching the B.A.T-Farmers struggle, according to an insurance lawyer currently working for B.A.T.    &quot;Our firm has talked to other companies, and we understand that several other bids may be in the wings,&quot; says James R. Woods, a partner with the New York-based law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby andamp; MacRae, which has a large insurance practice. &quot;This is the test case,&quot; he says. He wouldn't indentify the potential suitors or their targets, but said they all would be &quot;very large transactions.&quot;    Andrew Bogen, a lawyer for Farmers with the Los Angeles-based firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher, suggests one of Farmers's strategies when he says, &quot;In a hostile transaction, you've got one party seeing to it that every possible objection is brought forward, whereas in a friendly transaction, you have both sides saying it's a great deal.&quot;    That was one of B.A.T's problems in dealing with the California law barring government ownership of insurers. In other recent cases, Mr. Woods says, companies whose shares are owned by government pension funds have been allowed to acquire California insurance units without objection. The reason, apparently, is that the insurance department says it doesn't investigate each case in detail, but simply asks the company to declare that it isn't government-owned.    In B.A.T's case, Farmers challenged its statement that it isn't government-owned, and hired a British firm that specializes in digging out information about shareholders of U.K. companies.    Henry F. Frigon, president of B.A.T's U.S. unit, Batus Inc., said the delay because of the California ruling is &quot;troublesome&quot; and wasn't expected. &quot;Am I discouraged? Yes, but not enough to change our strategy one iota,&quot; he said. Mr. Frigon also said B.A.T expected that Farmers would bring up the issues of South Africa and tobacco -- Farmers pioneered certain kinds of non-smoking discounts -- but says, &quot;we didn't anticipate that they would dwell on them and distort them as they have.&quot;    Mrs. Gillespie, the California insurance commissioner, ruled against Farmers' objections to B.A.T based on its tobacco business and its South African operations. However, Farmers's attorneys were allowed to grill B.A.T Deputy Chairman Brian P. Garraway about B.A.T's smoking research.    Mr. Garraway testified that he wasn't familiar with the details of the research, or the opinion of a former B.A.T scientist that smoking increases the incidence of lung cancer.    Mr. Garraway also testified that B.A.T didn't instruct employees not to fly on Air Canada after the airline banned smoking on all flights. Later, B.A.T attorneys were forced to admit that B.A.T had recommended a policy of avoiding Air Canada if possible.    Farmers also has received letters or resolutions of support for its fight from Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), the Los Angeles City Council, several California legislators, and the Ohio House of Representatives.    B.A.T, for its part, attacked Farmers's outside directors for their lack of insurance industry experience before joining the company's board. B.A.T also noted that Farmers's general counsel, who is also a director, previously worked for a now-insolvent insurer.    Frequently, B.A.T is reminded that it needs approval from all nine states, no matter how small the Farmers unit in an individual state may be. The Kansas Insurance Commissioner, who regulates companies with 2.9% of Farmers' premium revenue, threatened to hold up B.A.T's solicitation of proxies for a non-binding resolution supporting its bid because it appeared to be a technical violation of Kansas law.    B.A.T negotiated a settlement that allowed it to proceed with proxy solicitations, but its proposal -- asking Farmers to reconsider its refusal to negotiate -- failed by a small margin to gain the majority of shares present at Farmers's annual meeting.    ---                       B.A.T's Applications    Status of applications to acquire Farmers Group    Arizona -- Approved    California -- Denied    Idaho -- Hearings held, no decision yet    Illinois -- Hearings held, no decision yet    Kansas -- Hearings to begin July 6    Ohio -- Hearings to begin June 27    Oregon -- Hearings held, no decision yet    Texas -- Hearings not yet scheduled    Washington -- Hearings to begin July 18</TEXT></DOC>
