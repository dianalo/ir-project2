TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The army twice blocked journalists from meetingPalestinians, and a leading Palestinian activist called the actionssigns that Israel is losing its battle against the 21-month-olduprising.   Also Tuesday, debate intensified in Prime Minister YitzhakShamir's coalition government over whether to accept Egypt's offerto arrange peace talks. Israel's two main parties headed for apossible showdown at an inner Cabinet meeting Thursday.   The army on Tuesday barred Palestinian activists from holding anews conference in predominantly Arab east Jerusalem and halted aU.N.-sponsored press tour of Palestinian refugee camps in theoccupied West Bank.   Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini told reporters at a policebarricade that by banning the news conference Israel was showingthat it is failing in efforts to quell the uprising against Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``We believe that we can win and what you are seeing now it isthe signs of the beginning of the end of the occupation,'' he said.   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek complained about the closure onIsrael radio, saying: ``They did not ask us, did not inform us ofthe reasons ... I think this arrangement is wrong and I plan toclarify that with the chief of command. The question is whether itcould be justified by security reasons, because it's becoming aroutine and this is not good.''   Police showed reporters an order issued by Maj. Gen. YitzhakMordechai of the army's central command declaring the scene of anews conference a ``closed military area.''   The news conference had been called to protest an army crackdownon the Christian town of Beit Sahour, which has mounted a civildisobedience campaign, refusing to pay taxes and boycotting Israeliproducts.   Olivier Rafowitz, a spokesman for the army-run West Bankgovernment, said the army would this week begin auctioning goodsconfiscated in tax raids on Beit Sahour. About $500,000 worth oftelevisions, cars and furniture have reportedly been seized.   About 45 foreign reporters and photographers traveling in a U.N.bus were turned back by the army at a West Bank checkpoint whilehundreds of private vehicles were allowed to pass, including thoseof Jewish settlers carrying weapons.   A statement issued by the army spokesman's office in Tel Avivcriticized the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for failing tocoordinate the visit in advance and said the army feared thepresence of journalists would incite violence.   More than 580 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiersand Israeli civilians during the uprising. Forty Israelis have beenslain. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabsas suspected collaborators.   Differences in the coalition Cabinet focus on Shamir'sobjections to a Palestinian delegation for peace talks that wouldinclude deported pro-Palestine Liberation Organization activists.   The talks would be over holding elections in the occupiedterritories.   The United States and Israel's left-leaning Labor Party favorthe proposed Cairo talks. But Shamir's Likud bloc fears that anymeeting with the expatriate Palestinians would be seen as implicitrecognition of PLO demands for the right of 5 million Palestiniansto return to land that is now part of Israel.   Yossi Ben-Aharon, a Shamir aide, suggested a compromise may bepossible under which Egypt, Israel and the United States wouldconvene for exploratory talks on the composition of a Palestiniandelegation.   President Bush on Monday told Shamir that he was willing to tryto arrange a summit with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.</TEXT></DOC>
