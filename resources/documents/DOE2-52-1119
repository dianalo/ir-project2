<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-1119 </DOCNO><TEXT>The second Born approximation for charge exchange with correct boundaryconditions is formulated for completely stripped projectiles impingingon hydrogenlike atomic systems. The theory employs the free-particleGreen's function G/sup +//sub /0 as an intermediate propagator. The usualchannel states are distorted by appropriate inclusion of the logarithmicCoulomb phase factors which are consistent with the perturbation potentials.The present method is computationally very attractive. In particular,the transition amplitude for a general homonuclear case was obtainedas a combination of two-dimensional integrals with smooth integrands.In an illustrative computation, good agreement is found between the proposedsecond Born approximation and the recent experimental differential cross-sectionsof Martin et al. and Vogt et al. on the most fundamental proton-atomichydrogen charge exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
