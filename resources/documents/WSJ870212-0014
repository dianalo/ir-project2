The missiles would be kept on six or seven of the bases, and in a crisis would travel around the U.S. rail system, evading enemy attack. Currently, MX missiles are being deployed in underground silos in the Rocky Mountain area. An earlier plan called for building a special rail system for the missiles.    The new plan, which awaits congressional approval, would require environmental impact statements for each of the bases under study. All of the bases currently are used for some part of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.    The Air Force hopes to choose sites in late 1988 or early 1989. The Air Force bases being studied are: Blytheville and Little Rock in Arkansas, Grand Forks and Minot in North Dakota, Whiteman in Missouri, Barksdale in Louisiana, Dyess in Texas, Fairchild in Washington, Malmstrom in Montana and Wurtsmith in Michigan.    As previously announced, Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming would serve as the main operating base for the rail-car missiles. </TEXT></DOC>
