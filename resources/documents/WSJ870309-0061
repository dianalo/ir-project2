Dennis Gorski, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, confirmed rumors that the real estate magnate made a bid for all of Resorts' 752,297 Class B shares outstanding. He declined to disclose terms. Mr. Trump, who was said to be traveling, couldn't be reached for comment.    A source close to Mr. Trump said, however, the offer was equal to Pratt's $135-a-share bid for the Class B shares.    Although Mr. Trump's offer matches the offer Pratt has had on the table since December, his prospects for prevailing seem much brighter than those of the Dallas-based casino operator, which has been rebuffed several times.    And unlike Pratt, which would have to borrow heavily for its takeover bid, Mr. Trump has large amounts of cash. As previously reported, he was expected to turn his attention to Resorts, based in Atlantic City, N.J.    The source close to Mr. Trump said the developer received encouragement from executors of the estate of Resorts founder James M. Crosby, who died last April. The estate holds 340,783 Class B shares, or a 48% voting stake. Resorts has about 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding, but each Class B share carries 100 times the voting power of a Class A share. The Class B shares represent about 93% of the voting power in the company.    Resorts Class B shares closed Friday at $123, up $1, and Class A shares closed at $56.25, down 37.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. Based on the closing prices, the company has an indicated value of about $422 million.    Mr. Trump recently sold back a 9.9% stake in Bally Manufacturing Corp. Mr. Trump, who recently threatened to take over the Chicago-based casino and entertainment company, was paid $62.6 million, or $24.08 a share, for 2.6 million of his 3.1 million Bally shares. He was given rights to sell the remaining shares to the company at $33 each.    Gerald Dickler, an attorney for the estate, wouldn't confirm or deny reports of Mr. Trump's bid for Resorts Class B shares. An analyst said the Crosby estate courted Mr. Trump in an effort to foil Pratt's bid. Indeed, Resorts' president and chief executive officer, I.G. Davis Jr., discussed a sale of the company with Mr. Trump during a ski outing in late February, according to an industry source.    Resorts representatives haven't met with Jack E. Pratt Sr., chairman of Pratt, to discuss a sale, despite his repeated overtures.    Pratt launched a tender offer last December for all Resorts Class B shares after being rebuffed repeatedly by the estate. As of January, 50,500 shares had been tendered.    While Class A holders aren't included in Mr. Trump's bid, many of them have said that they believe Mr. Trump could increase the value of their holdings by developing Resorts' real estate interests. With the Pratt offer, many Class A holders fear that Pratt could drain assets by awarding itself a huge management fee to help pay for the transaction.    If Mr. Trump is successful, the transaction would give him four casinos in Atlantic City. Resorts owns Resorts I and the Taj Mahal, which is under construction and is being billed as the world's largest casino. It also would give him Resorts' lucrative casino operations in the Bahamas and large holdings of undeveloped land there and in Atlantic City.    The estate was receptive to Mr. Trump's offer partly because he promised to complete the Taj Mahal on time and on budget, according to the source close to the developer. The Taj Mahal project has been plagued by delays and severe cost overruns. It initially was expected to cost about $185 million but now is expected to cost more than $525 million.    Because New Jersey law doesn't allow an operator to own more than three casinos, Mr. Trump could run into problems. He already owns Trump's and Trump's Castle in Atlantic City.    But several sources said that rather than selling one casino, Mr. Trump could meet terms of the rule by closing the casino in Resorts I and converting the facility into a hotel that would serve the mammoth casino in the Taj Mahal. Current plans call for Resorts I and the Taj Mahal to be connected by a skywalk. </TEXT></DOC>
