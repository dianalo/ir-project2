(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Air Force crews responding to the collapseof an MX missile in an underground silo last summer were concernedthat the rocket could have accidentally ignited, according to areport published Sunday.   Ignition inside silo Q-10 at F.E. Warren Air Force Base couldhave strewn highly radioactive plutonium around the site nearGuernsey, the Casper Star-Tribune said in a report based on the AirForce's final accident report, which the newspaper obtained througha Freedom of Information request.   Lt. Col. Charles R. Banta was quoted in the accident report assaying work crews worried that the rocket's solid fuel might havebeen cracked by the collapse.   ``If you have cracked propellant and you start moving it, youcan get friction within the crack and there was concern that itcould cause ignition,'' he said.   ``It (the missile's condition) was an unknown. We were operatingunder the (rocket maker Morton) Thiokol premise that said it wasrelatively stable; if you don't move too fast and don't put a lotof energy into the system, nothing will happen,'' said Banta.   Air Force officials declined comment when contacted by thenewspaper, saying the report spoke for itself.   The missile, capable of delivering 10 nuclear warheads, slidroughly 6 inches down in its silo sometime between last June 12 andJune 15 when part of the rocket's aft skirt collapsed.   During the incident the missile gave a ``missile away'' signal,but Air Force officials in their initial report attributed that tothe rocket's umbilical cord breaking away when the weapon settledto the base of its silo.   The Washington Post reported in January that the accident ledthe Air Force to take the heavy warheads off that missile and fourothers from the same production batch that had a common problem.The newspaper said the action ws taken to relieve weight on themissile until the problem could be solved.   Investigation determined that the collapsed missile's fuel didnot crack. In addition, the severing of the umbilical cord meantthere was no direct electrical connection and a grounding system toprotect the missile from static electricity was intact, thenewspaper said.   The Air Force placed odds of an accidental ignition at less thanone chance in 10 million.   An outside military authority, retired Navy Capt. James T. Bush,told the Star-Tribune the ignition danger was much higher, butadmitted he had no involvement with the MX missile. He is associatedirector of the Center for Defense Information in Washington.   Bush said the greatest danger of an accidental ignition of thesolid rocket fuel is the heat it would create inside the sealedsilo.   ``This fire would cook off or explode the HE (high explosive)component of the warhead,'' he said. ``You then have a highexplosive yield which would possibly blow open the missile hatchand distribute radioactive material for some unknown distance. Thatwould be very bad.''</TEXT></DOC>
