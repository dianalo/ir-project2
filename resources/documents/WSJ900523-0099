Boesky, whose cooperation led to the government'ssweeping insider-trading investigation, finally made hisdebut as a witness yesterday, testifying that he made illegalarrangements to sell securities to John A. Mulheren Jr.   Mr. Boesky avoided making eye contact with Mr. Mulherenand seemed impatient and sometimes even angered by ques-tions asked of him by assistant U.S. Attorney E. ScottGilbert and Mr. Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio. Mr. Boesky,once Wall Street's best-known stock speculator, wascooperating with the government as part of his 1986insider-trading plea agreement.</LP><TEXT>   Neatly dressed in a dark grey suit and white shirt, Mr.Boesky appeared gaunt and older than his 53 years. Shortlybefore his release from prison earlier this year, Mr. Boeskywas photographed with long grey hair and a beard. Butyesterday, his hair was cropped short and he wasclean-shaven.   Under direct examination by Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Boesky toldof receiving inside information on various stock transactionsfrom investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, bothof whom have pleaded guilty to felonies relating tosecurities fraud. Mr. Boesky, who spoke of agreeing to payfor this information, said he often gave that information toMr. Mulheren in 1985, although he said Mr. Mulheren never had&quot;knowledge of my source.&quot; Nor did Mr. Boesky ever tell Mr.Mulheren that his information was obtained illegally, Mr.Boesky testified.   Based on the inside information Mr. Boesky provided him,Mr. Mulheren bought stocks in companies that were takeovertargets, Mr. Boesky said. Mr. Boesky said he also advised Mr.Mulheren when to sell stock. Mr. Boesky said he illegallysold stock in Unocal Corp. to Mr. Mulheren to evade taxes andlater illegally agreed to buy back the shares and cover Mr.Mulheren for any losses his securities firm might suffer onthe stock.   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. He isnot charged with insider trading. The charges, broughtagainst Mr. Mulheren last year, were based largely oninformation provided by Mr. Boesky.   Mr. Boesky, who spoke in a firm voice, said he was once aclose friend of the 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren, whom he hasknown for about a decade. Mr. Mulheren once served asco-trustee of the trust Mr. Boesky established for hischildren. But after Mr. Boesky agreed to plead guilty in 1986to a single felony count and to pay $100 million in fines andcooperate with the government, he implicated Mr. Mulheren.Mr. Boesky was recently released from prison after servingmost of a three-year term.   In response to questions from Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Boesky saidhe is currently employed as a consultant to a company, whichhe didn't identify. Mr. Boesky said he advises that companyon &quot;different sorts of business planning that the company isundertaking.&quot;   At times, Mr. Boesky seemed to want to take charge of thequestioning. When a juror complained that she couldn't hearMr. Boesky, he instructed Mr. Gilbert to repeat the question,a task usually undertaken by the judge.   When asked by Mr. Puccio about certain records kept by hisbrokerage firm, Seemala Corp., Mr. Boesky refused to answerquestions. &quot;When were these records kept?&quot; Mr. Puccioinquired. &quot;You'd have to ask the keeper,&quot; Mr. Boeskyresponded. &quot;Were these records retained by your company?&quot; Mr.Puccio asked. &quot;You'd have to talk to the retainer aboutthat,&quot; Mr. Boesky said.   In an interview, Mr. Mulheren described Mr. Boesky'stestimony yesterday as &quot;pretty boring.&quot; He said: &quot;When youhear my testimony, you'll realize he wasn't much of afriend.&quot; But Mr. Mulheren said that if Mr. Boesky'sperformance as a government witness doesn't improve, Mr.Mulheren may not have to testify at all.   Mr. Boesky testified that his securities firm, Seemala,violated the net capital requirements of the New York StockExchange by having too little capital between June andOctober of 1985. But Mr. Boesky said he never worried muchabout the violations because he always believed that hisaccountants were underestimating the firm's capital position,a practice referred to by Boesky employees as the &quot;fudgefactor.&quot;   Mr. Boesky said that Stephen Conway, the president of hisholding company, warned in a June 1985 memo that Mr. Boeskywas &quot;on a self-destruct course.&quot; Mr. Boesky said Mr. Conwaytold him he was seriously below capital requirements and thathis business strategy was &quot;reckless.&quot;   The net capital violations are important because thegovernment has alleged that Mr. Mulheren manipulated theprice of Gulf andamp; Western Inc. shares and &quot;parked&quot; stock forMr. Boesky to help Mr. Boesky defeat net capitalrequirements. Parking occurs when an investor sellssecurities with the understanding that they will berepurchased, usually at a prearranged time and price.   Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the government has led toguilty pleas by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., former Drexeljunk bond wizard Michael Milken, Mr. Siegel, a formerinvestment banker at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. and Boyd Jefferies,former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc., among others. Mr.Mulheren is the only individual implicated by Mr. Boesky whohas chosen to fight the charges against him in court.   ---   VERMONT CAN'T FORCE appointed judges to retire at age 70,court rules.   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said appointedjudges, like most other employees, are protected underfederal age-discrimination law. The appeals court panelrejected Vermont's arguments that the judges were &quot;appointeeson the policy-making level&quot; and thus exempted from the law.The court also rejected Vermont's claims that theage-discrimination law violated constitutional protection ofstate sovereignty.   The appeals court said, &quot;We conclude that the language andstructure of the definition of `employee' {in theage-discrimination law} suggest that Congress meant thepolicy-maker category to comprise only policy makers workingclosely with the elected official.&quot;   The decision, however, is at odds with rulings in similarcases by two other federal appeals courts, each of whichfound that Congress intended for appointed judges not to becovered by the law.   William B. Gray, an attorney for the state of Vermont,said a decision on whether to seek U.S. Supreme Court reviewof the decision probably won't be made for several weeks.   ---   LITERARY AGENCY is formed by Boston law firm.
