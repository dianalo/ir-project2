Using cost models developedduring the study, an evaluation was made of the cost impacts of contractingout 5 to 20% of the existing services of 19 medium and large transitagencies, and all service of 3 small agencies. The evaluation determinedthat large agencies would save 2 to 49% of the costs of the contractedservice, with a mean savings of 28%, and that medium size agencies wouldsave up to 31% of the cost of service they contracted, with a mean savingsof 14%. No cost savings were indicated for some small and medium agencies.A separate analysis of potential cost savings, using a statistical modeldeveloped from data supplied by agencies which currently contract forfixed-route bus service, predicted that agencies of 100 or more vehicleswould save 26 percent of the cost of contracted services.</TEXT></DOC>
