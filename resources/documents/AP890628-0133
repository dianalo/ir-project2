The federal court jury deliberated for 12 days before finding thedefendants guilty of narcotics trafficking, pornography, auto theft,loan sharking and extortion.   Among the murder victims were witnesses and intermediaries forFlorida drug dealers. One victim was dismembered and his body partsleft in a garbage bag behind a store in Queens.   It was one of the longest trials in federal history. Testimonycame from more than 200 witnesses who described 17 murders and othercriminal acts.   The case, which dates back to a 1984 indictment, is one of thelast trials stemming from a series of widely publicized, mob-relatedprosecutions brought by then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani.   The original 78-count indictment charged that Paul Castellanoheaded a racketeering enterprise, the Gambino family, named forone-time reputed mob leader Don Carlo Gambino. It is one of fivemajor organized crime families in the city.   U.S. District Judge Keven T. Duffy, who originally had the case,broke it up in 1985 with the first trial focusing on a ring thatallegedly stole hundreds of cars in New York.   Before the conclusion of that case, Castellano was gunned downoutside a mid-Manhattan restaurant in December 1985. Eventually sixof the eight defendants remaining in that trial were convicted ofvarious charges.   Among the prosecution witnesses in this latest trial were VitoArena, a hitman-turned-informer who admitted his part in fourslayings, and Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone, a one-time enforcerfor the Westies, a predominantly Irish gang on Manhattan's West Side.   Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of the prosecutionwitnesses. One attorney said they were ``the worst collection ofpeople that has ever come into one criminal trial.''   The seven convicted defendants are Anthony Senter, 34; RonaldUstica, 44; Sol Hellman, 63; Joseph Testa, 34; Salvatore Mangialino,52; Douglas Rega, 39; and Carlo Profeta, whose age was unavailable.   Prosecutors alleged that the crew was headed by Roy DeMeo, whowas killed by gang members in a power struggle in 1983.   Another key defendant, Anthony Gaggi, died of natural causesduring the case. Gaggi was identified as a captain of the Gambinofamily who was a close adviser to Castellano.</TEXT></DOC>
