Subroto, Indonesia's former energy minister, made no statementon his arrival Wednesday. He was met at Baghdad Airport by OilMinister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi.   On Tuesday, Subroto met separately with Iranian President AliKhamenei and Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh seeking to persuadethem to allow Iraq a production quota of 2.39 million barrels aday, the same as Iran.   But there was no word on whether the Iranians agreed to anincrease in Iraq's present quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.   Iraq has refused to abide by its quota, insisting on parity withits gulf foe, Iran. The two countries recently began talks onpossibly ending the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.   Iraq is pumping an estimated 2.5 million barrels a day,worsening the over-production problem by some of OPEC's 13 memberstates.   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil publicationbased in Cyprus, reported this week that OPEC's production inAugust stood at 20 million barrels a day, or 3.5 million barrels aday over the overall production ceiling. This was seen as a keyfactor in declining oil prices.   Since he assumed his post June 1, the secretary-general has beentrying to find a practical formula that would curb the surplus andstabilize oil prices.   He has visited Venezuela, Equador, Saudi Arabia, Mexico andKuwait and succeeded in persuading Venezuela to drop its vetoagainst giving Iraq a quota equal to that of Iran.   Some OPEC members have opposed raising a member's quota becauseit increases production and further weakens prices.   Iran has been the only member opposing an increase of Iraq'squota.</TEXT></DOC>
