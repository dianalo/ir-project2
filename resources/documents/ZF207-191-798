(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By David StromandM;and Jane MorrisseyandM;ROSEVILLE, Minn.andP;  -- One of the first commercial applications of SQL Serverwas put into production last month on a network of only a few workstations,running prerelease OS/2 software and without a user interface.andP;  Despite thesehumble beginnings, the application probably saved airline passengers anaggregate $40,000 during its first week on line.andM;The new application, called Fare Assurance, is an adjunct to the System Oneairline-reservation system sold to travel agents by System One Corp., a TexasAir Corp. subsidiary.andP;  The new OS/2-based service, which went on line inMarch, requires no additional hardware for subscribers of System One, thethird-largest computerized travel-reservation system in operation, System Oneofficials said.andM;Fare Assurance uses the Microsoft/Sybase/Ashton-Tate SQL Serverdatabase-management and expert-system techniques to calculate the best farebetween two or more cities, based on specific criteria, such as restrictionsdictated by corporate travel  policies.andM;The software finds a lower fare than that generated by the mainframe-basedSystem One service for about 20 percent of the requests processed, with theaverage savings around $100 per fare, said Douglas Fogwell, senior directorof marketing services for System One Airplan Services, the division thatdeveloped the SQL Server application.andM;Engineers from Airplan Services looked at a variety of operating systems andhardware platforms to run their Fare Assurance software.andP;  They evaluated Unixon Digital Equipment Corp. minicomputers and using the System One's existingIBM mainframes.andP;  Developers said they were convinced that the advantages ofOS/2 server-based applications outweighed the risks of running prereleaseoperating-system software.andM;''We liked [Microsoft's] Named Pipes and were impressed with OS/2'smultithreaded capabilities,'' said Bruce Keller, a senior staff member ofAirplan Services, based here.andP;  Initially the group was ''dead set against''OS/2 in favor of Unix, he added, but it concluded that OS/2 and Unix weretechnologically even and OS/2 was more politically acceptable due to theIBM-heavy System One environment.andP;  ''We went with SQL Server because as longas we were going with Microsoft on OS/2 and LAN Manager, we might as well getSQL Server as part of the package.''andM;System One officials claim that Fare Assurance has several advantages overcompeting systems, including those offered by industry leaders AmericanAirlines Inc. and United Airlines Inc. With some systems, travel agentsmanually check for alternative fares by keying multiple queries into theirreservation system.andP;  Fare-checking services from other airlines such asUnited's Covia Corp. subsidiary automate some of this dirty work.andP;  However,these products are neither as sophisticated nor as flexible as FareAssurance, Fogwell said.andM;For example, Fare Assurance's corporate-policy guidelines allow for moreexhaustive alternative-itinerary searches due to the breadth of queries thatan agent can enter into categories such as acceptable cancellation fees andtime windows, he said.andM;Because of this extensive search, the software performs its analysis duringan overnight batch run at Airplan's offices.andP;  Thus, agents must wait at leasta day to find out what alternatives Fare Assurance has discovered, unlike thesame-day fare-checking services from all three top reservations systems.andM;The current offerings lack Fare Assurance's prime advantage, however, SystemOne officials maintain.andP;  The application can be programmed to check fares androuting periodically to ensure that no better fares become available in thedays leading up to the flight, they said.andP;  Typically, airlines change over100,000 fares each day and adjust discount seating frequently for eachflight.andM;Fare Assurance is the first major reservation system to offer farerechecking, Fogwell said, although third-party suppliers such as CompuCheckCorp. do provide this feature.andM;Savings can be significant.andP;  For example, during an actual production runobserved by PC Week, the software cut the potential cost of a Dallas-Houstonround-trip flight in half by using a combination of Delta Airlines Inc. andAmerican flights.andM;Ironically, the traveler had originally requested a round trip on ContinentalAirlines Corp., one of the airlines owned by Texas Air.andM;''Our system is impartial,'' said Mark Ahlstrom, general manager of AirplanServices.andM;Alstrom acknowledged that most airlines may not appreciate what FareAssurance contributes to -- or takes away from -- their bottom lines.andM;''It's in the best interests of corporations, but will harm the financialstructure of airlines,'' he said, referring to losses incurred by rebookingclients into cheaper seats.andP;  ''A lot of airlines would not like this to goon.''andM;Fare Assurance already has begun to pay off for some travel agents, however.andO;British Oxygen Corp., an industrial gas and health-care maintenance providerin Murray Hill, N.J., chose Revere Travel in nearby Lawrenceville because theagency offered Fare Assurance, according to officials at both companies.andP;  Theaccount was large enough that Revere opened a new branch office to serveBritish Oxygen exclusively.andM;''[Fare Assurance is] the first product I've seen that allows us to monitor a[request] until the time of departure,'' said Pam Koles, the travel-servicemanager for British Oxygen.andP;  ''My traveler is always assured of the lowestfare possible, which means a tremendous cost savings to my corporation.''andM;The service is offered at a fixed $50 one-time licensing fee per agency, withadditional prorated fees for the number of requests processed per month andthe number of users.andP;  For example, a typical monthly charge for 100 recordsprocessed per month for an agency of five users would be $100.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
