In a recent Gallup poll, twice as many Americans (58%) considered Japan to be &quot;the world's leading economic power&quot; as the U.S. When asked to assess the outlook for each country in the year 2000, a plurality of respondents continued to rate Japan ahead of the U.S., although the margin fell.    Among most U.S. Japanologists, there is even greater certainty. Their prevailing view is that the Japanese economy will continue to move forward, smoothly and successfully, outdistancing the U.S. and Western Europe in the process.    The American business community's views are more ambivalent, although many in financial circles express similar judgments. After all, the Japanese corporations listed on the Tokyo Exchange are worth, at current prices, 50% more than all of the U.S. corporations carried on the New York Stock Exchange.    There are, however, numerous reasons for disbelieving the consensus view. The Japanese economy faces several significant risks in the years ahead -- risks that add up to a likely prospect of relative decline in Japan's position in the world economy during the next decade.    One risk is that the Tokyo stock market may crash in the next few years, perhaps by even more than the 20% drop of the New York exchange in October 1987. The Nikkei index, now in the 34,000 range, has risen eightfold in the past decade, compared to a rise of less than 40% of that amount in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during the same period. Price-earnings ratios on the Tokyo market stand at about 55 to 1, compared to about 12 to 1, on the New York market.    But Tokyo's prices rest on a fragile foundation, because they are based on unsustainably high real estate values in the area environing Tokyo and other major cities. Many Japanese corporations hold large amounts of urban land. The extraordinary inflation of land prices in recent years -- Tokyo real estate has shot up by 200% since 1986 -- has inflated their balance sheets and therefore their stock prices.    Unfortunately for those firms' long-term prospects, the land scarcity is contrived, rather than real, a result of zoning restrictions originally intended to protect farmland from commercial development as part of the Japanese government's program to boost domestic rice production and achieve &quot;food security.&quot; But as the Japanese middle class becomes increasingly politically restive, a reaction already evident in the Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in the recent Upper House elections, those zoning restrictions are likely to be revised. When that happens, urban land values will begin to dip, the balance sheets of land-holding companies will sag, and the Nikkei index and price-earnings ratios are likely to tumble.    The gradual decline of Japan's legendary saving rate is the second major reason economic clouds may darken the rising sun. In the period from 1979 to 1984, Japan's private saving rate (household saving plus corporate saving as a ratio to private national income) exceeded that of the U.S. by nearly 11 percentage points -- 21.4% as against 10.6% -- and exceeded the OECD average by nearly 7%. These large margins have fueled Japan's export-led growth by financing its investment in advanced technology at home, its accumulation of enormous assets abroad -- including over $400 billion in the U.S. -- and its present position as the principal source of capital in global financial markets.    This advantage may not last much longer. According to a meticulous recent study by Professor Charles Horioka of Osaka University, two-thirds of the difference between the Japanese and U.S. savings rates can be explained by demographic factors: a lower ratio both of the aged (over 64) and of the young (under 19) to the working-age population. Since these two nonworking age cohorts are generally dissavers, their relative absence from the Japanese population has tended to boost aggregate saving rates.    But Japan is aging. The ratio of the aged to the working-age population is expected to rise from an average of 15% in the 1975-84 period to 27% by the year 2000. The ratio of the non-working young will be even lower than it is now, but the young's numbers will not shrink fast enough to compensate for the proliferation of the old. These demographic changes should produce a net lowering of the aggregate Japanese saving rate of 8.3% by the end of the century. The U.S. rate should stay the same or even rise over those years.    Compounding the powerful effects of changing demographics, Japanese consumption propensities are also likely to rise across all segments of the population as they become increasingly familiar with higher living standards in the U.S. and Western Europe. So the Japan of the 21st century may be expected to assume the role of a mature creditor country, importing more than it is exporting, and earning more from its foreign asset holdings than it is investing abroad to add to them.    Finally, the deep-seated mercantilist orientation of the Japanese economy will probably be buffeted by two strong forces in the international trade arena: formal and informal protectionism in the U.S. and European markets as well as the displacement of Japanese consumer durable products by competing lines from South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Indeed, the prospective liberalization of Japanese trade policy is more likely to accelerate penetration of the Japanese market by exports from these East Asian economies than by those from the U.S. and Western Europe.    Of course, the clouds over Japan's economic future may disperse. Yet pessimism is at least as plausible as optimism. While pessimistic forecasts of the relative economic decline of the U.S. have been widespread in recent years, in fact this scenario is more likely for Japan.    ---   Mr. Wolf directs RAND Corporation research in international economics and is dean of the RAND Graduate School. </TEXT></DOC>
