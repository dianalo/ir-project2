Eddie Hatcher, 31, was arrested by FBI agents Friday on a warrantfor unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for his role in takinghostages at a North Carolina newspaper last year, said FBI spokesmanChuck Latting. He was arrested immediately after leaving theconsulate.   Hatcher had gone to the Soviet consulate to seek asylum andprotest alleged inequities in the U.S. justice system, saidBernadette Sambrano, a friend who accompanied him. Soviet officialsasked him to leave after about three hours, said Sambrano, a memberof the International Indian Treaty Council.   Consulate press attache Sergei Aivazian declined comment.   Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, 20, held up to 20 people hostage inthe offices of The Robesonian newspaper for 10 hours on Feb. 1,1988. The two Tuscarora Indians said they wanted to draw attentionto their claims that law enforcement officials were involved in drugtrafficking and other corruption.   The siege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to investigate theircharges. A task force found no evidence to support the claims, andMartin later said they were based on ``rumor and gossip.''   In October, a federal jury acquitted both men on federalhostage-taking and firearms charges after a three-week trial. But aRobeson County grand jury indicted the two men on kidnapping chargesin December.   Hatcher was arrested in Pembroke, but Jacobs fled the state andsought sanctuary at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse,N.Y.   Hatcher fled to the same reservation after his $25,000 bond wasposted by the National Council of Churches. He later left New Yorkand sought refuge on the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho. Hedisappeared several weeks ago after being taken into tribal custody.   ``The state of N.C. and the government of the United States hasmade every vindictive attempt to destroy my life, my family and mypeople,'' Hatcher said in a handwritten statement sent out of theSoviet consulate. ``They will not cease until they have accomplishedthis.   ``I see no hope in the American government, nor do I seefairness.''   Jacobs was arrested in New York after leaving the reservation anda state judge is considering whether he should be extradited toNorth Carolina.   Harris Tabac, an attorney representing Hatcher, said the decisionto retry Hatcher on state charges was a ``boldly illegal move'' by a``brutally racist county.''   ``In our attitude, the trial already occurred and we won,'' hesaid.   Tabac said he will ask for court hearings to argue that Hatcherwould be risking his life by returning to North Carolina and has nochance of getting a fair trial there.   Earlier, in a telephone call from the consulate to The AssociatedPress bureau in Raleigh, N.C., Hatcher said, ``I'm tired of beingpersecuted for winning the federal case.''</TEXT></DOC>
