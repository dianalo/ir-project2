Notice that when you prss theP key, the letter P appears on the edit line of the control panel.andP;  Also, theReady mode indicator in the top-right corner of the display changes to revealthat you're entering a label.andP;  Whenever you start a cell entry by typing aletter, 1-2-3 assumes that you're entering a label.andM;Finish typing the word Pencils, then press Return.andP;  The word Pencils appearsin cell A4, and 1-2-3 returns to Ready mode.andP;  As long as the cell pointerresides in a cell, 1-2-3 displays the cell's contents in the top-left cornerof the display.andP;  Whem you look there now, the current cell address appears,followed by a colon, an apostrophe, and the word Pencils.andM;You didn't type an apostrophe when you entered Pencils, yet 1-2-3 shows anapostrophe as part of the cell's contents.andP;  The apostrophe is a label-prefixcharacter.andM;To contrast the label entry with a numeric entry, move the cell pointer tocell B4 and enter the number shown in the worksheet figure.andP;  Notice that whenyou type the number's first digit, 1-2-3 recognizes that you're typing avalue and changes the mode indicator accordingly.andP;  1-2-3 accepts the entry asyou type it; no label prefix appears after the current-cell indicator in thecontrol panel.andM;Here's the simple rule: 1-2-3 stores numbers exactly as you enter them, butevery worksheet label begins with a label prefix.andP;  The prefix doesn'tactually appear in the spreadsheet, but it is an integral part of a cell'scontents.andP;  In most cases, 1-2-3 inserts a label prefix automatically when youstart typing a label.andP;  But you can start any label entry by typing the prefixcharacter yourself.andM;To see how this works, move the cell pointer to cell A5 and type anapostrophe.andP;  Be sure to select the apostrophe that shares a key with thequotation mark.andP;  Now type the word Binders and press return.andP;  The labelappears in the cell, as shown in our worksheet.andP;  In the control panel, 1-2-3displays the entry preceded by a label prefix.andM;Move the cell pointer to cell A6 and enter the label Notepads, then move thepointer to cell A7 and enter Erasers.andP;  You decide in each case whether youwish to type the label prefix before typing the rest of the label.andM;WHY PREFIXES?andM;The most important use for label prefixes is in determining how 1-2-3positions a label in its cell.andP;  The apostrophe label prefix that 1-2-3automatically supplies when you create a label indicates that the lableshould appear left-aligned, that is, begin at the left edge of the cell.andM;There are two other prefix characters that control a label's alignment.andP;  Thequotation-mark label prefix right-aligns a label; the caret (*) centers alabel in the cell.andM;Move the cell pointer to cell A9 and type a quotation mark, then type Totalsand press Return.andP;  This new entry isn't flush left with the previous entries.andO;It aligns with the right side of the cell.andP;  And you can see in the controlpanel that 1-2-3 did not insert an apostrophe before the entry.andP;  By startingthe entry with a valid label prefix, you override the default, or built-in,prefix.andM;The entries in cells B3 and C3 are centered.andP;  Move the cell pointer to cellB3 and type a caret (it shares a key with the 6 on the top row of yourkeyboard), then type Jan and press Return.andP;  Move the pointer to cell B4 andenter * Feb.andP;  Then, so that your worksheet matches ours, enter the remainderof the values in columns B and C.andM;Your simple practice worksheet is almost complete.andP;  Before you enter theworksheet's title, there's another label prefix that you'll find useful inalmost every spreadsheet you create.andP;  The backslash (\) prefix characterindicates to 1-2-3 that whatever characters follow should appear across theentire width of the cell.andM;We've used the backslash label prefix to create the dividing lines in cellsB8 and C8.andP;  To do this, move the cell pointer to cell B8 and type abackslash.andP;  Note that this is not the slash that appears on the same key asthe question mark.andP;  Then type a single minus sign, which shares a key withthe underline, and press Return.andM;In the control panel, 1-2-3 displays the cell's contents as you entered them:a backslash followed by a minus sign.andP;  However, in cell B8 the entry appearsas nine minus signs.andP;  Move the cell pointer to cell C8 and enter a backslashand a minus sign the same way.andM;1-2-3 can repeat any character or characters across the width of a cell.andO;You'll probably use the minus sign and the equal sign most often, butexperiment on your own with other characters and see how the backslash canreduce your efforts in enhancing a worksheet's appearance.andM;Now, what about that title at the top of the worksheet?andP;  Each label we'veentered so far has nine or fewer characters.andP;  The title in row 1 of ourillustration has 26 (even the space between two words counts as a character).andM;To create the title, enter the complete phrase in cell A1: Move the cellpointer to cell A1 by pressing the Home key, Type Monthly Revenue by Product,and press Return.andM;Even though the entire lable resides in cell A1, 1-2-3 displays the extracharacters overlapping cells B1 and C1.andP;  There are no characters in cells B1and C1.andP;  You can prove this by moving the cell pointer to the right andobserving the current-cell indicator in the control panel.andM;If you were to make an entry in cell B1, 1-2-3 no longer would display all ofthe labe in cell A1.andP;  If you haven't done so, move the pointer to cell B1.andO;Then enter the number 8.andP;  Suddenly cell A1 appears to contain only the labelMonthly.andP;  R. Cell A1 still contains the entire label as you entered it, but1-2-3 assumes that you want to see the information stored in cell B1.andP;  In asense, the contents of cell B1 cover the balance of the label in cell A1.andO;You can uncover cell A1's label by erasing cell B1--a task that we'll leavefor a future discussion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
