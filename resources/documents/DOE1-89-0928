<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0928 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process for producing tungsten heavy alloy billets is described comprising:(a) forming a uniform blend of elemental powders to form tungsten alloyshaving a tungsten content of equal to or less than about 91% by weightand wherein the particle size of the tungsten is no less than about 2micrometers in diameter; (b) uniformly packing the powder blend intoa container, the container being made of material having thermal expansionsimilar to the powder blend; (c) sintering the powder blend in a hydrogenatmosphere at a temperature sufficient to impart strength to the powderand to reduce oxides and remove volatile impurities from the powder withoutsignificant densification in the powder; and (d) solid state sinteringthe resulting strengthened powder in a reducing atmosphere at a sufficienttemperature to densify the powder to at least about 90% of the theoreticaldensity but at a temperature below the liquid phase sintering temperatureof the powder blend to form the billet.</TEXT></DOC>
