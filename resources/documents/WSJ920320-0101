Quite appropriately and quitecourageously, you not only challenged Congress to pass yourproposals but gave the institution a specific deadline --March 20. It is now clear that Congress will not approve yourproposals, but instead will send you a bill that is whollyinadequate -- a bill we urge you to veto.   In that same State of the Union address, you stated thatif Congress does not approve your proposals by March 20, &quot;thebattle is joined.&quot; We urge you to fulfill that promise bytaking unilateral action to address the economy and improvethe effectiveness and accountability of government ingeneral. We have outlined a series of such initiatives. Weurge you to give them careful consideration and commenceappropriate action immediately following Friday's deadline.   To decrease tax rates on capital and to stimulateinvestment, we urge you to:   1. Direct the secretary of treasury to index capital gainsand depreciation for inflation. For both capital gains anddepreciation, the &quot;cost basis&quot; is determined not inlegislation but in regulation. The secretary of treasurycould cut tax rates on capital simply by defining the costbasis as the original cost adjusted for inflation. This notonly would promote economic growth but would end the practiceof requiring people to pay taxes on phony gains attributableto inflation.   To reduce the regulatory drag on the economy, we urge youto:   2. Establish a regulatory budget and cap it. One recentstudy estimates the annual cost of federal regulation to be$400 billion. At least until economic growth is restored, theregulatory drag should not be allowed to increase. Thus, weurge you to direct all agencies to submit their regulatoryproposals and then approve them only when accompanied byinitiatives to reduce the overall cost of regulation by alike amount.   We suggest that you ask the vice president to administerthis regulatory budget program through his Council onCompetitiveness and through the Office of Management andBudget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Toaccomplish this initiative we suggest that you extend the90-day regulatory review process and moratorium announced inJanuary (including the targeting of existing rules forreview) and request the so-called independent agencies toabide by regulatory Executive Orders.   We also urge you to address the immense bottleneck in ourfinancial institutions. At present, monetary policy to enableor promote long-term growth is hampered severely by unusuallystringent capital requirements for banks and savings andloans.   3. Direct the Comptroller of the Currency, the FederalReserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporationto liberalize capital requirements by adopting the &quot;Baselstandards.&quot; Following Congress's failure to make fundamentalreforms in the deposit insurance system, the financialregulators adopted a too-stringent set of capitalrequirements, the result being that banks and Sandamp;Ls are unableto expand the supply of credit at an appropriate rate. AsMartin Feldstein pointed out recently, adopting theinternationally recognized Basel standards &quot;would increasebank lending, stimulate recovery, and help to provide fundsfor sustained expansion.&quot;   Although the effect on the economy would not be asimmediate or as direct as in the case of the initiativeslisted above, we urge you to endeavor to control the overalllevel of government spending and eliminate waste.Specifically, we urge you to:   4. Take initiatives to reduce the level of federalspending. We urge you to submit a series of rescissions toCongress to eliminate low-priority spending in currentappropriations and then work to obtain discharge petitions toforce up-or-down votes. We also urge you to announce yourintention to veto any appropriations that increase spendingby more than the rate of inflation. Even without changes inthe tax code, every dollar saved is a dollar that must not beborrowed and on which interest need not be paid.   5. Direct all agencies not to spend funds in a mannerinconsistent with presidential policy unless mandated by law.It is clear that appropriations report language does not meetthe presentment clause of the Constitution and therefore doesnot constitute law. Far and away, the most detailed spendingdirections are found in the committee reports that accompanyappropriations bills, not the actual bills that are passed byCongress and signed into law. It is by such means that most&quot;pork&quot; enters the budget. Thus, we urge you to directagencies not to spend appropriated monies for low-priorityprograms at the expense of more appropriate projects.   We urge you to consider additional items to improve thefunctioning of the economy and of government itself. Theseinclude:   (a) directing the secretary of treasury to issue bondsindexed for inflation (to minimize interest cost to thegovernment and to lower interest rates in the economy),   (b) directing the secretary of commerce to minimizeunwarranted affirmative findings under the antidumpingstatutes (to reduce costs to consumers),   (c) directing the secretary of agriculture to implementthe agricultural marketing order program so as to minimizerestraints on the supply of foodstuffs (to reduce costs toconsumers),   (d) directing the secretary of labor to inform workers oftheir rights under the Beck decision (to increase workertake-home pay) and to revise definitions of &quot;prevailingrates&quot; under the Davis-Bacon law (to reduce governmentconstruction costs),   (e) implementing productivity improvement goals for eachfederal agency, instructing agency heads to reduce personnel,and privatizing additional programs (to reduce costs andimprove services),   (f) directing agencies to grant appropriate waivers tostate governments with respect to Medicaid and other supportprograms (to improve coverage and lower costs), and   (g) enforcing Executive Order 12606 requiring agencies toassess the impact of their regulations on the family.   Mr. President, the events over the past several monthshave demonstrated the existence of an additional problem ofenormous proportions: the lack of accountability in Congress.Voters may decide on the qualifications of individualcandidates, but their ability to affect the accountability ofthe institution as a whole is indirect at best. Therefore, webelieve you should:   1. Submit omnibus legislation to apply all laws toCongress. Probably more than any other single initiative,making Congress live by the laws it applies to everyone elsewould increase the institution's accountability. Suchlegislation would include not only well-publicized items suchas race and sex discrimination, but laws and regulationsrelating to ethics and conflicts of interest that now applyto persons in the executive branch.   2. Submit a recession to reduce appropriations for thelegislative branch. A major reason for the lack ofaccountability in Congress is that over the past two decadesthe institution has grown in topsy-turvy fashion. It is nowrife with warring factions, politicized staff, enormous wasteand little regard for the taxpayer. Cutting legislativeappropriations would focus the minds of congressmen more onthe responsibilities, rather than the accouterments, ofoffice.   We note with approval the news that the U.S. Attorney forthe District of Columbia is investigating reports ofcongressional malfeasance. If violations of law areuncovered, we believe those responsible should be prosecutedin the same manner as they would be if they did not holdpositions of privilege and power.   Mr. President, we respectfully urge you to take quick,decisive action following March 20 to revitalize the economyand secure accountability in Congress.
