Testscompleted to date include whole-animal acute toxicity and in vitro mutagenicityassays of various SRC-I/TSL products, intermediate streams, and wastes.Several whole-animal carcinogenicity assays are still in progress. Invitro mutagenicity assays showed that SRC-I/TSL waste materials thatmight enter the environment were nonmutagenic, but as expected, someliquid products showed mutagenicity, which was related to boiling point,similar to other coal liquids. Unexpectedly, aqueous suspensions of solidSRC-I/TSL products were also mutagenic. Most products and intermediatestreams had low acute toxicity, but some materials, especially low- andmedium-boiling-range liquids, were skin and eye irritants, possibly reflectingtheir high phenolic content. Test results indicate the need to protectworkers from exposure to many SRC-I/TSL materials, including some thoughtto be of little hazard. If the SRC-I/TSL process is demonstrated on acommercial scale, health-protection plans will have to be modified, especiallyto minimize emissions of SRC-I/TSL dust.</TEXT></DOC>
