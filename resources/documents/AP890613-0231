(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of miners today defied aback-to-work order and joined thousands of fellow United MineWorkers across West Virginia in the second day of a sympathy strike.   The miners walked out Monday in a show of support for 1,600 UMWmembers on strike against Pittston Coal Group in Virginia and WestVirginia since April.   ``They're going to try to shut down all the union and non-unionmines by the end of next week,'' said Dave Evans, a strikingPittston miner. ``You'll see a nationwide and Canadian strike _whatever it takes to get this settled.''   An industry official today said the walkout appeared to beconfined to southern West Virginia's UMW District 17 _ the union'slargest, with 8,000 members.   Consolidation Coal Co. said 250 of its 4,000 employees stayed offthe job today despite a back-to-work order issued by a federal judgeon Monday. The company had argued that its workers were barred bycontract from striking.   ``As of this morning the court order has been ignored,'' saidConsolidated spokesman Paul Kvederis. He had no other word on whatthe company planned to do.   Top union leaders did not immediately return calls today. UMWleaders have insisted the strike was spontaneous and not sanctionedby the union.   Under their 1988 contract, the miners can take a 10-day``memorial period'' and walk off the job to air grievances, but theymust give notice beforehand. None of the coal companies struckMonday said they were informed.   The president of the West Virginia Coal Association estimated10,000 miners refused to show up for work Monday.   The number of mines or mining companies affected by the walkoutwas not immediately available.   Monay's wildcat action was in support of the 2-month-old walkoutUMW against Pittston. Many miners say a Pittston victory might set aprecedent that could reverse gains made by unions early this century.   The Pittston miners have been working without a contract for 14months. They went on strike over wages, benefits and workingconditions.   Over the course of the Pittston walkout, more than 2,200 miners,retirees and their spouses have been arrested for civil disobediencesuch as blocking coal trucks.   A state judge in Virginia has jailed three union leaders andfined the union $3 million for disobeying an order limiting picketsat Pittston.   ``Whatever it's gonna take to get the court systems to drop thefines and get our fellas out of jail in Virginia, that's how longit'll last,'' said Perry Harvey, a UMW field representative in Logan.</TEXT></DOC>
