It is known that U.S. oil production has declined since the precipitous fall in the price of oil, and imports of crude oil and refined products have risen. By the 1990s, the U.S. will be importing 50% of its oil requirements without exporting Alaskan crude oil. For every barrel of crude oil exported, a barrel of foreign oil must be imported. Under the scenario outlined in the article, considerably more than 50% of our oil requirements will have to be imported.    To state that the U.S. would produce 500,000 barrels a day more crude oil, should Alaskan crude oil be allowed to be exported, is ludicrous. There is no financial incentive to explore or drill for oil resulting from the export of Alaskan crude oil. Most of the transportation savings achieved through the use of foreign flagships to export Alaskan crude oil would accrue to the state of Alaska in the form of higher taxes paid by producers.    Once we agree to export our oil, we will have to live with that commitment, even in times of crisis. It is naive to think that the U.S., once it agrees to supply crude oil to the Pacific-rim countries, would be able to withdraw its oil from a trading partner in the event of an oil crisis. Once the precedent is set that we are exporting Alaskan crude oil, it will be very difficult, diplomatically, to change course.    The argument that Alaskan crude oil that is piped through the Trans-Panama pipeline is equally vulnerable to a supply cutoff, as is Middle East oil, is not realistic. There are sufficient U.S. flagships to bypass the use of the Trans-Panama pipeline and to utilize the Panama Canal, which the U.S. certainly would keep open as an international waterway. Up until 1983, prior to the construction of the Trans-Panama pipeline, the U.S. merchant fleet had moved upward of 650,000 barrels a day of Alaskan crude oil through the Panama Canal without difficulty and would be able to do so again should the Trans-Panama pipeline be shut down.    Not only would the export of Alaskan crude oil increase our dependence on foreign oil, but also it would do irreparable harm to our U.S. merchant fleet. More than $1 billion was invested by shipping companies and oil companies to build a tanker fleet to service the Alaska trade. Such investments would be damaged severely should export of Alaskan crude oil be allowed. To rely on foreign flag vessels in times of national emergency is very shortsighted. Typically, during international crises ships become scarce.    A strong U.S. merchant fleet is absolutely vital to the national security of our country, and to thrust it aside in such a cavalier manner is not very prudent. The gain for a foreign oil company and the state of Alaska does not justify the negative effect the export of Alaskan crude oil would have on our country.    Richard C.
