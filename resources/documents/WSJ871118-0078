But in one case involving Bankers Trust Co., even that may not be enough.    For Bankers Trust, this particular loan -- $2.5 million to a local steel mill -- represents just 0.0095% of the bank's $26.3 billion loan portfolio. But for Liberty, a town of 10,000 ravaged by last year's oil-price bust, a dispute over the loan could doom its hopes for economic recovery. At the heart of the matter is Bankers Trust's refusal so far to accept a bankruptcy-case settlement of 100 cents on the dollar-plus interest and fees.    &quot;I don't understand it,&quot; says Paul Henry, a local banker.    How the town and the bank reached this peculiar impasse is a story of bankruptcy proceedings, bailouts and breakneck negotiations -- of an oil-supply company that went bust, suddenly encountered a boom and now threatens to go bust again. Among its characters is a Venezuelan businessman whose offer to buy and resurrect the mill hinges on the bank's decision.    &quot;There's only one deal sitting on the table, and if that deal doesn't go through, the plant has to revert to liquidation,&quot; says Mayor C. Scott Parker. &quot;The impact to the area economy would be just devastating.&quot;    But the bank's collateral on the loan is plant machinery that is valued at $5 million, twice as much as the loan itself. Bankers Trust says a liquidation would effectively guarantee full return of its money, so its fiduciary duty won't permit it to take any risk on any settlement, no matter how small.    The last chapter may be written this week in a bankruptcy court in Houston, as both sides try to come to terms before a supplier takes back critical raw materials -- but that is jumping the gun. Like all the most vivid tales of economic misfortune in oil-busted Texas, the story of Liberty's battle against Bankers Trust has its roots in 1986, when oil prices plummeted below $10 a barrel.    In April of that year, National Pipe andamp; Tube Co. of Liberty was driven into the arms of the bankruptcy court. At one time the state-of-the-art, oil-pipe mill -- built in 1976 -- employed 880 workers, equal to nearly a tenth of Liberty's population, which now numbers about 10,000. The plant hung on with a work force of 90 until September, when the half-mile-long factory on the 160-acre site was shuttered.    But not for good -- or so everyone thought. In the meantime came an investor group led by Venezuelan businessman John Castellvi, who had conceived a plan to pay off all creditors as part of a plan eventually to acquire the mill. The Venezuelan's timing was perfect: so much pipe-making equipment had been wiped out elsewhere because of the oil bust that demand was surging for the very products manufactured here, particularly as the oil industry began its nascent recovery.    Suddenly, hope sprang eternal. Coils of raw steel were ordered. Laid-off workers quit looking for jobs elsewhere. A dozen employees began donating their time to keep the plant in tip-top shape for the longawaited day of its reopening. James Amy, for instance, has been coming in to run the generators periodically.    &quot;It's kind of like a stadium before anybody gets there,&quot; he says while walking through the cavernous plant full of echoes and idle equipment. But, he adds, &quot;people are ready to perform.&quot;    So, too, were most of the creditors in the plant's Chapter 11 case: National Steel Corp., with its $7.1 million note; the local school district, which all along did everything possible to cooperate; 350 sundry suppliers, and others -- all readily agreed to sign off on the Chapter 11 plan.    Not Bankers Trust, however.    &quot;The offers have not been in a form which has been satisfactory to us,&quot; says Richard Solar, chairman of Bankers Trust's BT Commercial Corp. unit, which extended the loan. &quot;The amount,&quot; he adds, &quot;has always been satisfactory.&quot;    First, the Castellvi group, which formed National Pipe andamp; Tube Holdings Co. to acquire the plant, offered to pay 100 cents on the dollar. Despite the assurances from the group's lenders, Bankers Trust felt it still faced risks greater than in liquidating the plant: Under certain circumstances, if the takeover group itself wound up in bankruptcy proceedings, the bank reasoned, the payment to Bankers Trust could be reversed in those possible bankruptcy proceedings.    Later, the group sought to provide funds to the mill itself, which would in turn pay Bankers Trust. The bank objected on technical grounds: It says that offer didn't include the normal 10-day waiting period to give other parties time to object.    Third, the group offered to have two guarantors of the Bankers Trust loan, who are shareholders of the mill, pay Bankers Trust themselves. The bank says there was a risk there, too, because one of the holders was involved in separate litigation that could have driven him into personal bankruptcy, again posing the potential for later reversal of Bankers Trust's payment.    Townspeople and some others suspect the rejections lie more in the fact that the bank's loan happens to be over-collateralized -- particularly now that the machinery is in short supply, and therefore more valuable. &quot;Everybody got rattled when the bank wouldn't take its payment,&quot; says Adam Chaumont, whose father owns several businesses in Liberty. &quot;The plant must be worth more than the bank turned down.&quot;    Bankers Trust strongly denies it sought a liquidation or could have gained more from an asset sale than from a negotiated payment. &quot;We have not wanted this delay. There's no hidden agenda,&quot; Mr. Solar says. He adds that if the plant were liquidated, the bank couldn't receive any more than the $2.5 million, and that any other money would go to other creditors.    &quot;Customarily, when you get paid off on a situation in bankruptcy, you get paid off in such a method that you have no ongoing risk,&quot; Mr. Solar says.    In a town this size, the plant's business is everybody's business, because it once was the largest private employer. And the town is rallying. From Friday to Sunday, local businesses collected 6,000 signatures on petitions seeking to save the plant.    Now that he's got the signatures, however, Mayor Parker isn't quite sure what to do with them, but is considering taking the two-inch stack to Bankers Trust headquarters in New York -- as a statement of sorts, he explains.    While many people in Liberty signed the petition, some aren't so sure it will have any effect. &quot;Those people in New York don't care if we live or die,&quot; says M.J. Somers, manager of Voygt's five-and-dime store on Main Street.    The plant's survival also depends heavily on its major supplier, Ferrostaal Metals Corp., the U.S. unit of a major West German steel trader. The company has agreed to hold a 12,700-ton order of steel for the plant another week pending the negotiations with Bankers Trust. But the supplier has been getting edgy because of all the delays. &quot;Had we known it was going to take that long, we probably wouldn't have been that lenient,&quot; a Ferrostaal spokesman says.    But if an agreement isn't reached shortly, &quot;Ferrostaal will resell the steel and we will be unable to reopen our plant,&quot; says Maximo A. Tejeda, president of National Pipe.    But a payment agreement suitable to both the Castellvi group and Bankers Trust could be reached shortly, both sides indicated late yesterday, and a motion could be filed in bankruptcy court as early as this week. &quot;We are negotiating in good faith to enable him to buy the company within the next 10 days,&quot; Bankers Trust's Mr. Solar says. But Mr. Castellvi cautions, &quot;I'm a bit skeptical because we've been down this route before.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
