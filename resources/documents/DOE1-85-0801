The underlyingobjective is a methodology for representing atmospheric motion in appliedair-pollution models that permits explicit treatment of the uncertaintyinherent in the specification of atmospheric states. The nature of thisuncertainty is illustrated by showing that a set of discrete meteorologicalobservations made at a given moment in time and the diagnostic equationsof fluid motion together define a manifold in function space each pointof which is a possible description of the state of the atmosphere atthe moment the observations were made. It is argued that hypotheses canbe adduced regarding the liklihood that individual points on the manifolddescribe the atmospheric state at the time of the observations; but that,contrary to common practice, adequate information does not exist to allowone to state with certainty that a specific function is the correct description.The paper shows that dynamic programming is ideally suited to findingthese sequences which constitute the desired ensemble of wind specificationsin space and time.</TEXT></DOC>
