But the government program baffles some of the inmates and theirlawyers. They complain that the parole policy is incoherent andinconsistent, quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundredswith sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparentreason.   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1,093detainees have been freed since the uprisings, compared with 92released in the six months preceding the riots. INS officials denythe uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy.   In all, since the riots ended in early December, 2,224 Cubanshave been recommended for release and 1,208 have been deemed unfitfor the streets, said Duke Austin, spokesman for the INS inWashington. Twenty-four detainees have been marked for deportation,and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by May31.   U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III promised the full reviewsas part of an agreement that ended the riots, in which one Atlantadetainee was killed and several others were injured. None of thehostages was injured.   The 2,400 men in detention at Atlanta and Oakdale last fall hadcommitted crimes after arriving in this country from the Cuban portof Mariel in 1980, when Fidel Castro allowed 125,000 Cubans toleave.   At the time of the riots, however, the detainees had servedtheir sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest ofthe INS.   Some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four yearswhen they learned that the State Department and Cuba hadreactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of ``excludable''immigrants.   The Oakdale center erupted in flames on Nov. 21; the Atlantaprison fell to the Cubans two days later. The Justice Departmentwould later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant four-hournotice given prison officials by the State Department.   The Louisiana siege ended after eight days, but Atlanta'suprising went on until Dec. 4, becoming one of the longest infederal prison history. Damage at the two prisons was estimated at$64 million.   The prisons were shut down, and the detainees, some of whominsisted they would rather die than return to Cuba, were scatteredto prisons across the country. Since then, most of have been heldin ``lockdown'' status, confined to special seclusion areas 23hours a day.   ``They just sit in those cells, waiting and getting depressed,''said Linda Serrano of Atlanta, whose common-law husband, ManuelCasalis Noy, was approved for parole in November but has yet to bereleased.   Despite the release statistics, some advocates for the detainees_ including Bishop Augustin Roman of Miami, who helped end thesieges _ maintain the government has not completely lived up to itspromise.   ``The detainees aren't being given full reviews, they're justbeing interviewed. What's more, the government doesn't even make anofficial record of these panel reviews, something you must have ifthere is to be an effective appeal process,'' said Karen Ellingson,a Legal Aid attorney in Minneapolis who has sat in on more than 70interviews conducted by the 20 two-person INS review teams.   The pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots, detaineeadvocates say.   Late last month, U.S. Justice Department spokesman PatrickKorten said the accelerated, post-riot releases reflected a moreliberal parole policy. However, Craig Raynsford, associate counselat INS, said, ``I assure you these people are not being morefavorably treated because they rioted.''   He said the number of parolees has risen sharply because thereview procedure implemented last June was slow and laborious, andonly recently began to bring about large numbers of releases.   ``There's a cumulative effect at work here,'' he said. ``Ourparole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent, the same asit was before the riots.''   Gary LeShaw, an attorney who works with the Atlanta-basedCoalition to Support Cuban Detainees, said his office is stillswamped with calls for help. More than 1,100 men approved forrelease remain in prison ``for one reason or another, such as ashortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors,'' he said.   Supporters of the detainees note that, prior to the riots, allbut about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses. SinceDecember, hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to theirfamilies and sponsors.   ``Some detainees are being released right away, almost pushedout onto the street, while others, including some who have goodprison records and committed far less serious crimes, remain behindbars for months,'' said LeShaw. ``Nobody seems to know what's goingon.''   Although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach,Raynsford said all look for the same thing in makingrecommendations: ``Whether the detainee is presently non-violentand likely to stay that way, whether he is likely to present athreat to the community, and whether he is likely to violate hisparole.''   He also noted that a special appeals tier had been created fordetainees who are turned down for parole. Even those who have beenscheduled for ``repatriation'' to Cuba can appeal.   ``But these are just paper appeals,'' said Ms. Ellingson. ``Youdon't get to face your accusers. Besides, it's just another case ofthe INS, which has been responsible for the incarceration of thedetainees, acting as their judge and jury.''   She gave a recent experience as an example of why the process isso frustrating:   ``Officials of Dismas House, a non-profit facility in KansasCity, recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved forparole. The halfway house took 18 of them and left the othersstranded in prison, not even knowing why they weren't selected,much less when they would be released.''   Asked why, the director of Dismas House, the Rev. EverettThornton, said he had room for only 18 detainees. ``We try and lookfor motivation, that's the most important thing,'' he said.   But Ms. Ellingson said other factors are involved, such as adetainee's appearance and his ability to speak English, ``thingsthat really shouldn't matter that much.''   Even some detainees who have been released question the fairnessof the INS process. One of them is Mario Ochoa of Brooklyn, who wasreleased in March, just three weeks after his panel hearing.   ``I think I was released so quick because my wife went toWashington several times and talked to congressmen and reportersabout my case; she really worked hard for me,'' said Ochoa, whofinished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadlyweapon with intent to use it.   ``But,'' he added, ``I'm one of the lucky ones. There are othersstill in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimesthan I did. I really can't figure out what's going on.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Strat Douthat is the AP Southeast regionalreporter, based in Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
