The technique revealed which variant of a particular gene eachof six people had, by analysis of a single hair each person hadshed, the scientists wrote in the British journal Nature.   John Hicks, deputy assistant director of the FBI laboratory inWashington, D.C., called the work ``very exciting.''   The technique cannot yet prove that a hair came from aparticular person, but in combination with other evidence itsresult can be seen as ``very, very significant,'' he said.   Further refinements may let it make identifications with morecertainty,   The work was conducted by Russell Higuchi and Henry Erlich ofthe Cetus Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., and George Sensabaugh andCecilia von Beroldingen of the University of California, Berkeley.   It focuses on DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, which forms tinythread-like structures called chromosomes in every cell of thebody. DNA consists of sequences of chemicals. Some sequences formgenes, which control the activities of a cell.   Details of DNA sequences vary from person to person, andresearchers have exploited that fact to help solve crimes bystudying such ``DNA fingerprints.''   In February, for example, a Florida jury convicted a 24-year-oldman of rape after testimony that his DNA matched that found insemen left by the rapist.   Hair that has been ripped from the body, as in a struggle, oftencontains enough living tissue in its root area for conventional DNAanalysis.   But more often, police recover hair that has simply fallen off aperson at the crime scene, and that hair contains far less DNA,experts say.   The California researchers overcame that problem by using alaboratory technique called polymerase chain reaction that created100 billion copies of a particular portion of DNA.   The ability to analyze a single hair is important, said Hicks,because that is typically all that is available at crime scenes. Inaddition, multiple hairs from a crime scene may have come fromdifferent people, said forensic hair expert Skip Palenik at McCroneAssociates in Chicago.   At present, a shed hair is examined microscopically for itsphysical appearance, Palenik said. But because different people canhave similar-looking hairs, the new DNA technique ``represents avery important first step'' toward firm identification of peoplefrom a shed hair, he said.   In the study, the researchers reported using a test to determinewhich of 21 versions of the ``DQ alpha'' gene is present in anindividual. The gene plays a role in the disease-fighting immunesystem.   In tests of six people, the researchers reported, a single shedhair correctly indicated which version of the gene each person had.   More recent tests show success rates of 40 to 70 percent,Higuchi said in a telephone interview, adding that researchers planto try an improved testing procedure.   He said the next step is testing for more geneticcharacteristics, to allow greater certainty in linking a hair to aparticular person. If the hair and a person share characteristicsthat fewer than one in 1,000 people possess, that would greatlyhelp in making the link in court, he said.   Standard DNA fingerprint techniques offer more definitivematches, with the chance of two people sharing the same DNAcharacteristics described as one in several billion.   Hicks said that with further development, the new techniquecould well ``approach the fingerprint-type identifying capability.That's what we'd be looking for down the road.''</TEXT></DOC>
