The nationwide chain has a policy that all employees must becleanshaven, but no Maryland health law prohibits food serviceemployees from having beards.   The June 28 commission complaint said that Prabhjot S. Kohli, ofCatonsville, was refused employment when he applied for a job asmanager of a Domino's store in December 1987.   Herb James, personnel director of LOOC Inc., the Domino'sfranchise that interviewed Kohli, said the complaint was ``a slapin the face to us when we are desperately trying to work things outwith this individual.''   James, quoted in Saturday's Baltimore Sun, said Kohli knew thedress code and policies when he interviewed for the job and that healso was unwilling to work the weekend and night hours required. Hesaid other company jobs that did not involve contact with thepublic were available, but Kohli refused to consider them.   Kohli, now an engineer with the State Highway Administration,said he applied for the advertised position of senior managerbecause he had 18 years' experience as a salesman. He said he wasnot interested in the other jobs.   In its complaint, filed with the state administrative hearingexaminer, the Human Relations Commission asked that Domino's payKohli for two years of lost earnings and that he be hired as aDomino's manager. The examiner's office will hold a public hearinglater.   A week ago, the commission won a case that ordered theUniversity of Maryland to reinstate and pay back pay to a campuspoliceman who refused to shave his beard because of a skincondition.   That case, decided by a state administrative law judge, involvedcharges of racial discrimination because the skin condition,pseudofolliculitis bearbae, usually afflicts black men. Men withthe ailment suffer scarring and lesions when they shave.</TEXT></DOC>
