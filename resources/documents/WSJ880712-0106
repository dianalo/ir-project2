Whatever the court's decision, some shareholders are going to be disappointed.    At issue is Macmillan's plan to split the publishing and information services company into two publicly held concerns, while at the same time paying shareholders a special $52.35-a-share dividend. Macmillan has valued its plan at $64.15 a share.    Challenging the plan is Robert M. Bass Group, which made a $73-a-share, or $1.9 billion, offer for the company. Bass Group contends the Macmillan plan would transfer control of the company to Macmillan senior executives for a lower price than Bass Group is willing to pay.    Macmillan analysts are split over the value of the company, with estimates ranging from $70 a share to as high as $95 a share. But most acknowledge that in an industry that in recent years has been overrun by wealthy European investors, neither Bass Group's nor Macmillan's offer is the best holders could have hoped for.    &quot;Both sides are trying to steal the company,&quot; said Bert L. Boksen, chief investment officer of Raymond James andamp; Associates. &quot;If Macmillan or Bass succeeded in getting the company in the low 70s, that would be the lowest valuation in any recent publishing acquisition. It would be a disappointment to people who know the industry.&quot;    Mr. Boksen said that from a shareholder's perspective, he is rooting against the Macmillan plan, hoping a loss will force the company to seek a third party willing to pay a higher price. &quot;So far, no one has stepped to the plate willing to pay full value for the company,&quot; he said.    During a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court two weeks ago, a Bass Group analyst was quoted by Macmillan lawyers as having valued the company in the high 90s. A later cash-flow valuation by the same Bass analyst estimated the company's worth at $92 a share, still well above Bass Group's $73-a-share bid. Macmillan lawyers claimed Bass Group's bid would keep shareholders from realizing the true value of their holdings.    But Bruce Thorp, a media analyst at Provident National Bank who estimates Macmillan's value at about $85 a share, said shareholders should take the highest cash payment and forget about the stock in the two spinoff companies Macmillan has proposed. &quot;Those two companies will be so highly leveraged, I would be afraid to put a very high value on those shares,&quot; Mr. Thorp said. &quot;I think the best thing would be to get the cash now and put it elsewhere.&quot;    Wayne Johnson, an analyst at H.G. Wellington andamp; Co., agreed. &quot;Both of those companies would have so much debt that chances of having operating earnings for the next several years would be slim,&quot; he said.    J. Kendrick Noble Jr., an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said different kinds of shareholders might want different outcomes. While arbitragers and institutional investors might prefer the Bass proposal for the immediate cash, long-term individual investors might prefer Macmillan's restructuring because of tax consequences. If Macmillan succeeds, Mr. Noble said, &quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock price driven down by the arbitragers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
