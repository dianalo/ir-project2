The justices today were to hear arguments challengingCalifornia's taxation of books, tapes and other merchandise sold bythe Louisiana-based Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.   Backing California in the dispute are two organizations notusually allied in court _ the American Civil Liberties Union andthe National Conference of State Legislatures.   California court rulings forced Swaggart's ministry to pay thestate $183,000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981.   But lawyers for Swaggart's organization say the California tax,as applied, violates religious freedom and due process and undulyinterferes with interstate commerce.   After hearing from both sides today, the nation's highest courtis expected to announce its decision by July.   The disputed state sales and use tax is imposed on ``retailers''for the privilege of selling personal property in California, andon the consumption of products within the state.   The tax was imposed on sales by the Swaggart ministry duringcrusades in California and sales made through the mail.   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Baton Rouge, La.,to California consumers totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandiseat California crusades totaled $240,000.   Swaggart's lawyers are relying heavily on a 1943 high courtruling that overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses whoviolated a city ordinance requiring all people engaged indoor-to-door canvassing to get a license and pay a fee.   The Jehovah's Witnesses were distributing religious literature,and the 1943 ruling said, ``This form of religious activityoccupies the same high estate under the (Constitution's) FirstAmendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from thepulpits.''   But a California appeals court ruled that ``nondiscriminatory''taxes levied on sales _ including sales by religious groups _ areconstitutional. The California Supreme Court refused to reviewSwaggart's appeal from that ruling.   Numerous organizations have filed ``friend of the court'' briefsin the case.   Defending the state tax, lawyers for the ACLU said theconstitutional guarantee of religious freedom ``does not mandate areligious exemption from a neutral, nondiscriminatory tax on salesof tangible property.''   Providing such an exemption, the ACLU brief contended, wouldviolate the constitutionally required separation of church andstate.   But lawyers for the National Council of Churches, representingmost Protestant denominations among its members, called theCalifornia tax ``a serious threat ... a tax on the dissemination ofreligious messages, and thus a forbidden tax on the exercise ofreligion.''   A similar brief submitted by the International Society forKrishna Consciousness said that group has paid, under protest,nearly $300,000 in taxes to California for sales of religiousliterature by its members.   Under the Hare Krishna ritual of Sankirtan, members are requiredto distribute such literature and solicit money from the public tosupport the religion.   Lawyers for a coalition of evangelical ministries argued that ifthe California tax is upheld ``the door will be wide open for over7,000 taxing jurisdictions to impose a similar burden on nationalreligious ministries.''   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,88-1374.</TEXT></DOC>
