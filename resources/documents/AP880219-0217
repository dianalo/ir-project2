Democratic National ChairmanPaul Kirk told his squabbling presidential candidates to cool it.   The Democratic candidates save Sen. Albert Gore Jr. debated inSt. Paul, Minn., ahead of the South Dakota primary and Minnesotacaucuses, while the Republicans debated over a debate that dwindledto just two candidates.   Rep. Richard Gephardt and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakisdrew fire from their Democratic presidential rivals in thefree-wheeling debate that indicated their status following wins inIowa and New Hampshire.   At the Republican debate in Dallas, reduced to a one-on-oneevent by the refusal of Dole and Pat Robertson to participate, bothBush and Rep. Jack Kemp said they regretted the boycott and said itwould hurt their opponents.   Bush and Kemp clashed bitterly over nuclear defense strategy, asBush asserted the New York congressman won't understand war until``you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''   In Oklahoma City earlier, Bush suggested that Dole was broodingover New Hampshire.   ``You learn that the rodeo is full of hard encounters with theground and you learn to pick yourself up and dust yourself off andget back on the horse again,'' Bush said.   ``So you don't get angry and bitter when you get defeated. Youpick yourself back up and get back on the horse and go on and winthe next election.''   But in Lexington, Ky., Dole shrugged off Bush.   ``We're ready to go. We're ready for the next round in SouthDakota and Minnesota and we'll see who wins those two. We'll seewho's dispirited Wednesday morning next week,'' he said.   With only a few days to go, a Bush aide said the campaign was``pulling out'' of South Dakota.   ``We're going to concentrate our resources on the South. AndDole got an enormous bump from Iowa,'' said the aide, who did notwant to be identified.   Gore skipped the Democratic debate to make a money run toCalifornia, where he took a question about which of his rivals wereDemocratic deadwood.   ``Mike Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Dick Gephardt _ all threerepresent an old approach that has been associated with losing fourout of the last five elections,'' he said.   And rival Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois reversed his earlierstatement that he could not continue his campaign unless he woneither South Dakota or Minnesota next week.   ``I'm in this race until Atlanta,'' Simon said first in SiouxFalls, S.D., then in Minneapolis. ``And we're going to begin withthe strongest show of support we can muster from committedDemocrats in South Dakota and Minnesota who seek a fundamentalchange in America's direction.''   After watching Republican bickering from afar, Kirk wrote a``Dear Candidate'' letter that said, ``I simply want to urge allour candidates to resist any ... kind of negative personal attacksthat smack of desperation and do nothing to enhance the opportunityfor a Democratic victory in November.'' The letter was writtenThursday _ just hours before the Democratic candidates fought outtheir Dallas debate.   With the letter in the mail, longshot candidate Gary Hart madeit clear he hopes for a brokered convention, which would be Kirk'sworst nightmare.   ``It will be for the convention to decide,'' Hart said inMinneapolis. ``There is the chance now, for the first time in 30 or40 years, for a convention to decide this nomination.''   The Democrats focused on Midwestern voters, hoping that goodshowings in Tuesday's South Dakota primary or Minnesota caucuseswould serve as an image and momentum booster.   Jesse Jackson drew hoots from the crowd during the Democraticdebate when he asked Gephardt if he was ``proud of your vote forthe Reagan tax cut in 1981.''   The Missouri congressman defended his overall tax voting record,saying most of that tax cut ``went to ordinary people.''   ``That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis,'' Jacksonsaid.   Dukakis, the winner of the New Hampshire primary, complainedthat ``my name was taken in vain'' by Hart, who demanded to knowwhy Dukakis had not followed his example and released a budgetproposal.   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is becausethey don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced abudget,'' retorted Dukakis.   On the Republican side, Friday night's Dallas debate dwindled toa cozy twosome between Bush and Kemp. The Bush campaign consideredstanding up the Dallas crowd but decided to go through with it. Forhis part, Kemp openly relished the opportunity of a one-on-one withBush.   ``They couldn't get me out of here with a crowbar,'' he said.   In an exchange over the intermediate-range nuclear forces treatyand other arms issues, Bush pointed out that Kemp opposes the INFtreaty and said it would be wrong to support ``prematuredevelopment'' of a defense shield. ``I want to reach out for peace,and I'm sorry, but I think it is good to be doing that,'' Bush said.   Kemp told Bush, ``you have yet to mention how important it isfor this country to stand up for something other than peace.''   The vice president shot back: ``I was in combat (during WorldWar II). I don't think you know what it is until you've seen yourfellow man drop dead.''   Dole, campaigning in Tampa, Fla., denied he had collaboratedwith Robertson to boycott the Dallas debate. Dole said he didn'twant to be part of a Bush ``pep rally'' in a state where the vicepresident once lived and was elected tothe U.S. House.   Bush, on the campaign trail in Oklahoma City, denied Dole'sassertion that the Dallas event would be stacked against Dolebecause more tickets were given to Bush supporters.   In Nevada, Bush took the lead in a presidential straw polltallied in the early morning hours, with 27 percent of the vote.   But Robertson backers claimed a delegate victory by combiningundecided ballots (23 percent) and votes for their candidate (15percent).   Dole had 22 percent and Kemp was the choice of 13 percent.   Steve Wark, Robertson coordinator in Nevada, claimed most of theundecided votes, saying they were cast by Robertson supporters aspart of a strategy to keep Bush and Dole guessing until upcomingcounty conventions.</TEXT></DOC>
