Investors, particularly foreign investors such as the Japanesewho are avid buyers of federal debt issued by the Treasury, havebeen wondering whether Fed members, all appointees of PresidentReagan, are willing to mete out the potentially painful medicineneeded to cool an overheating economy.   ``Now they should know,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fedmember who is now chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation of America.   On Tuesday, the board voted 6-0 to hike the discount rate, thefee it charges for short-term loans to member banks, from 6.0percent to 6.5 percent. Analysts said a variety of other interestrates, including those on home mortgages, auto loans and creditcards, are likely to climb in response.   Changing the discount rate is the most dramatic move in theFederal Reserve's arsenal for controlling the nation's money supply.   Since early March, the board has made a series of less overttightening moves, pushing up the federal funds rate _ the interestbanks charge each other for overnight loans _ by more than apercentage point to 7.75 percent.   Many analysts, noting that GOP chances of keeping control of theWhite House are better if people are feeling prosperous, hadexpected the Fed to continue nudging up the federal funds rate asnecessary while avoiding the abrupt action of raising the discountrate until after the elections.   Ironically, economists' expectations may have played a role inprompting the Fed to suprise them by acting sooner, Gramley said.   ``Those sorts of comments ... certainly have not gone unnoticedat the Federal Reserve,'' he said. ``It's not a situation they canafford to take lightly. They need to convince markets that they'reoperating with the long-term health of the economy in mind. Theyare sending that signal with what they did.''   The board, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects theintent of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures.''   Although inflation of consumer prices for the first six monthsof the year was, at 4.4 percent, the same as last year, there aresigns of trouble ahead.   Unemployment, at 5.4 percent last month, is near its 14-yearlow. Also, factories straining to meet both domestic and foreigndemand are operating at their highest capacity levels in eightyears.   The worry is that the scarcity of labor will push up wage rates.It is also that the growth in jobs, by putting money in people'spockets, will keep consumer demand high at the same time thatfactories are trying to produce more goods for export to meetoverseas demand fueled by the devalued dollar.   The Fed's move is aimed at curbing this ``demand-pull''inflation, the kind of price and wage increases that occur whenthere aren't enough goods to go around or enough workers to performneeded services.   But the cure has its cost: consumers will have to pay more tofinance home, auto and other purchases. And, as they slow theirbuying, fewer new jobs will be created.   People with loan payments pegged to interest rate fluctuations,such as adjustable rate mortgages and home equity loans, will beamong the first to feel the effects. As their loan payments rise,they'll have less money to pay for other goods and services.   ``I think the Fed proved beyond any reasonable doubt that itdoes have a backbone and that it is willing to fight inflation evenin an election year,'' said David Jones, an economist with AubreyG. Lanston andamp; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.   But, tightening the money supply now, Jones argued, could beboth good politics and good economics. Moving now, rather than nextweek, avoids imposing bad news on the Republican NationalConvention in New Orleans. And, moving now may avoid a morewrenching action later.   ``If they had not done it now, they may have been forced totighten right in the teeth of an election,'' Jones said. ``Thetiming is just about right. We may now at least have a shot at asoft landing, which is the way we can have sustainednon-inflationary growth.''   Tuesday's discount rate increase was the second rate hike sinceAlan Greenspan became Fed chairman a year ago. In September thecentral bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, thefirst increase in three years.   Last year's increase was seen by analysts as Greenspan'sattempt, a month after succeeding the respected Paul Volcker, toestablish his inflation-fighting credentials. But, some latercriticized it as one of the factors precipitating the October stockmarket crash.</TEXT></DOC>
