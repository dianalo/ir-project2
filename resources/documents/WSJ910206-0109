One governor and mayor after anotherhas come forward recently to issue doleful accounts of largeand unwieldy government structures crumbling for lack ofadequate revenue support from taxpayers. While thesetragedies unfold, it might be instructive to turn to onestate that's too young to be falling apart, that is thrivingeconomically and that now is tempted by the siren song ofbigger government and higher taxes.   It's Nevada, of course, the fastest-growing state in thecountry, now home to 1.3 million people clustered amidcountless square miles of federally owned desert. Many of thenewcomers are attracted by inexpensive living. That includesthe absence of income taxes, and other such advantages overneighboring states.</LP><TEXT>   But with growth have come apparently enlarged expectationsof the public sector. If a recession is avoided and revenuescontinue going up 19% in the next budget cycle, Democrat Gov.Bob Miller still expects to fall more than $100 million shortof his spending plan. He wants a 1% payroll levy, which,according to a silly line in his latest state-of-the-statespeech, &quot;is a tax paid fully by businesses, not by individualemployees.&quot; Of course, it will be paid like an income tax bythe workers, only in the form of reduced compensation. That'show labor markets work.   The schools lobby set this in motion by demanding more.State employees want a raise too. But Mr. Miller's scheme isencountering opposition in the legislature, which seemsinclined to turn to the golden goose of gaming. The casinosalready bear a significant part of Nevada's tax load.   A young, developing state has a particular opportunity toprovide services differently, through privatization, vouchersand choice, before an entrenched government-union apparatusmakes such a course more difficult. Regrettably, Nevada seemsheaded down the familiar path. Growth in population andpersonal income will never seem to provide sufficient publicrevenues, so rates will go up and new levies will be added.Then, if one day growth ends and a touch of decline sets in,the public sector will say its burdens are greater than ever,that the state has many &quot;needs&quot; and new taxes will bedemanded from a diminishing base.   That's been the Permanent Taxation Cycle across the UnitedStates, interrupted only when popular tax revolts knock thepoliticians and bureaucrats for a temporary loop. Otherwise,it's like extended play at one of Nevada's black-jack tables-- you can expect to lose.</TEXT></DOC>
