And as it does, the importance of the &quot;farm issue&quot; in next month's Iowa caucuses is melting away like snow in a January thaw. That issue seems unlikely to have more than a diffuse, muted impact --ironic as it may seem in a rural state whose economy still pivots on agriculture.    The old Farm Crisis, the stuff of magazine covers and Hollywood movies, has become the Farm Problem: still serious, probably chronic, but with less power to inflame emotions and motivate caucusgoers. Iowa's rural economy remains on a heart-lung machine, dependent upon record subsidies from Washington. But as long as Washington keeps pumping in those subsidies, the situation will remain stabilized, even improving a bit.    That is &quot;Iowa's big secret,&quot; says Des Moines Register editor James P. Gannon. &quot;Yes, yes, I know: It is practically un-American to say, right out loud, that the farm crisis is over,&quot; Mr. Gannon wrote after hints of a rural turnaround began to come in last year. &quot;But it is.&quot;    Listen to realtor Patrick Corkrean, across the street from the wedding-cake courthouse of 1876, and you can almost see the farm issue receding.    &quot;Farmers are spending money again,&quot; concludes Mr. Corkrean, who's also the Madison County Democratic chairman. A big reason: federal programs like the Conservation Reserve, which pays them to idle crop land. Last year, when the program offered bonuses for signing long-term contracts, a few area farmers reaped windfalls of $10,000 or more. &quot;It was a real sweet deal,&quot; says Mr. Corkrean.    Or drop in at Toad's Place, a cafe in Greenfield, in neighboring Adair County. Most any morning, you can find two groups there, taking coffee around their separate tables. They are the Sweats (who claim to be the harder-working) and the Never-Sweats. Among the Sweats and Never-Sweats it is possible to find support for candidates as far apart as George Bush and Jesse Jackson. What is almost impossible to find --even in a county one Sweat describes as &quot;the ruralist of the rural&quot; --is a voter who seems motivated primarily by the farm issue.    &quot;There are so many other things that are important too,&quot; says Richard Kuhl, a Sweat and a county supervisor. &quot;How a person handles himself. How you think he'd do.&quot;    The comment seems typical of Iowa's mood a month before the Feb. 8 caucuses. Last month the Register spent about 10 full columns to summarize the farm program of each presidential candidate. Two weeks later, the big spread had yet to generate its first letter to the editor. Iowans were far more likely to write about Gary Hart and Donna Rice.    &quot;Issues aren't moving people this year,&quot; concludes Rep. David Nagle, a former state Democratic chairman. &quot;Character and competence are moving people.&quot;    The rural Iowa landscape, black and olive drab in the slanting winter sunlight, remains pockmarked with signs of financial distress. Most small towns, unlike beautifully refurbished Winterset, look threadbare and rundown. Statewide, roughly one-third of all Iowa farmers are thought to remain in precarious financial shape.    Candidates still feel compelled to stress rural issues on swings through this state --whether they're in the mood or not. &quot;I ain't going to milk no cow in the mornin',&quot; Jesse Jackson protested to staffers on a visit to his state headquarters in Greenfield last year. Yet a photograph records that, at the crack of dawn the next day, Mr. Jackson was gingerly seating himself beneath the udder of a Holstein cow.    But the reality is that the candidates' audience is badly fragmented this year.    Economically, rural Iowa remains &quot;a land divided,&quot; says Rep. Nagle. Even as the financially strong are getting stronger, the weak are barely holding their own. Thus, each candidate tends to zero in on a piece of the whole: GOP candidates Robert Dole and George Bush work the prosperous; Democratic candidates like Richard Gephardt and Paul Simon concentrate on the merely distressed; Jesse Jackson claims the downright despairing.    But it's a lead-pipe cinch that most farmers won't participate in the caucuses at all. An Iowa League of Rural Voters poll suggests that 25% of Iowa farmers may take part, though this may be optimistic. When the same poll asked which party was doing the better job of handling the rural problem, the winner, at 53%, was &quot;neither.&quot;    The subdued rural mood seems particularly striking when viewed from this part of southwestern Iowa. For the little hamlet of Orient, southwest of here, was the birthplace of Henry A. Wallace, an architect of the modern agricultural program and, more than that, an authentic voice of rural protest. Part politician and part mystic, Mr. Wallace bolted the GOP to become Franklin D. Roosevelt's agriculture secretary and later vice president --then bolted the Democrats to lead a third-party candidacy in 1948.    Today, Iowa honors Henry Wallace with a granite marker in a wind-whipped little park in the cornfields. But interviews on the neighboring farmsteads find few traces of the Wallace indignation --or, for that matter, anybody who intends to participate in the coming caucuses.    &quot;I don't go in much for politics. Just never got started,&quot; explains Roy Murray, a laconic 70-year-old in Big Smith overalls.    &quot;I don't think the farmer will have much impact on any of them (the candidates) anyway,&quot; shrugs Dale Pals, huddled in his hooded sweatshirt as hogs snort and snuffle in the background.    He's probably right. The rural vote is a minority vote, even in farm states like Iowa. And the political reality may be that what farmers already have --the flawed but generous 1985 farm act --is about as good as they're likely to get. &quot;Budget pressures tend to set current policy in cement,&quot; observes Eugene Moos, agriculture adviser to House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).    There is an uneasy sense hereabouts that Washington budget cutters could turn in earnest to the 1985 act once the November elections are safely past. &quot;In fact, this cannot go on,&quot; worries Steven Niblo, a Winterset farmer. &quot;The taxpayer won't put up with it.&quot;    But for the moment, the act and its subsidies have brought a measure of relief to a rural economy that has known only pain for most of this decade. And Mr. Niblo, for all his concern about what the next administration may do, doesn't intend to participate in the caucuses next month.    &quot;Nobody's come forward yet,&quot; he says of the confusing candidate field. &quot;We don't have a leader.&quot;    ---                  Sign of a Rural Turnaround    Estimated Iowa Farmland Values, per acre:    1983                     $1,691    1984                     $1,357    1985                       $948    1986                       $787    1987                       $875    Real estate debt, Iowa farms and households    Dec. 31, 1982             $9.0 billion    Dec. 31, 1983              9.1 billion    Dec. 31, 1984              8.8 billion    Dec. 31, 1985              8.1 billion    Dec. 31, 1986              7.2 billion    Sources: Iowa State University economics department; U.S. Department of Agriculture</TEXT></DOC>
