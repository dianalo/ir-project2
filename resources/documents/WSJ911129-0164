(FDC)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)</GV><RE>DELAWARE (DE)NORTH AMERICA (NME)NEW YORK (NY)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The banking bill passed by Congress willbolster the deposit insurance fund, tighten bank regulation,slightly trim the scope of federal deposit insurance and givethe Federal Reserve Board new authority to regulate foreignbanks in the U.S.   Congress refused to adopt Bush administration proposals toallow banks to establish branches nationwide, affiliate withcommercial companies or expand their ability to sellinsurance and securities. President Bush is expected to signthe bill, but the administration intends to continue fightingfor these changes.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Congress stripped from the bill acontroversial measure to impose a floating cap on credit-cardinterest rates.   Here are highlights of the legislation:   -- FDIC Funding. The bill bolsters the shrinking bankdeposit insurance fund with $70 billion in borrowingauthority. It increases to $30 billion from $5 billion theamount the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. can borrow fromthe Treasury to cover the costs of bank failures. The loans,plus interest, would be repaid by premiums that banks pay ondomestic deposits over the next 15 years.   In addition, the bill allows the FDIC to borrow forworking-capital needs. The money -- about $45 billion -- andinterest would be repaid as the FDIC sells the assets offailed banks.   -- Bank Regulation. The bill establishes a new regulatoryregime by firmly linking supervision to bank capital.Regulators must set five capital levels for banks andthrifts, ranging from well-capitalized to criticallyundercapitalized. Regulatory action would be mandatory ascapital fell. This corrective-action regime must be in placea year after the law is enacted.   In addition, regulators must draft a new set ofnon-capital measures of bank safety, such as underwritingstandards and minimum earnings levels, to take effect Dec. 1,1993. The legislation also requires regulators to performannual, on-site bank examinations; place limits onreal-estate lending by banks; and tighten auditingrequirements.   -- Deposit Insurance. The bill reduces the scope offederal deposit insurance. The most significant change wouldend the so-called too big to fail doctrine, under which thegovernment protects all deposits, even those beyond the$100,000 insurance limit, in most banks. The FDIC's currentability to reimburse uninsured deposits -- those over$100,000 and foreign deposits -- would be sharply limitedafter 1994. The Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep banksalive with extended loans from its discount window also wouldbe restricted, starting two years from enactment.   In addition, only the best-capitalized banks would be ableto offer insured brokered deposits -- large certificates ofdeposit sold through brokerage firms -- or to insure accountsestablished under employee pension plans.   In an attempt to give banks an incentive to follow saferpractices, the bill instructs the FDIC to change the way itassesses banks for deposit insurance, moving from flatpremiums to fees that require banks engaging in riskypractices to pay higher premiums than conservatively managedbanks. The new system must be in place by Jan. 1, 1994.   -- Foreign Banks. In response to the problems with Bank ofCredit andamp; Commerce International, the legislation would givethe Federal Reserve new authority to police foreign bankoperations in the U.S.   -- Securities Provisions. The legislation for the firsttime explicitly gives brokerage firms access to FederalReserve discount window loans in times of financial crisis.Currently, the Fed provides emergency liquidity to WallStreet through banks, but Morgan, Stanley andamp; Co. and Goldman,Sachs andamp; Co. argued that direct borrowing would make emergencycredit lines more secure.   Another provision would protect plaintiffs' rights toproceed with billions of dollars of securities fraud suitsfiled before the Supreme Court's June decision in the Lampfcase, which changed the statute of limitations.   -- Miscellaneous Provisions. The measure protects therights of Citicorp and Bankers Trust Co. to underwriteinsurance in Delaware but bars other bank affiliates fromunderwriting.   The bill relaxes the &quot;qualified thrift lender test&quot; forthrifts by allowing them to invest more of their assetsoutside of housing-related areas.</TEXT></DOC>
