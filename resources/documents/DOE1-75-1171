Theangiographic features were many medullary veins draining into a singlelarge vein. CT scans revealed that each draining vein was linearly enhanced.On the other hand, the T/sub 2/-weighted images of the MRI demonstrateda draining vein as a low-signal intensity in all 4 lesions and the venousangioma as a high-signal intensity in one lesion. To demonstrate thesedraining veins, the sagittal view of the MRI was found to be very useful.</TEXT></DOC>
