Perkins gave his first news conference in 2{ years in SouthAfrica just before boarding a plane to the United States, where heis expected to become director-general of the Foreign Service.   ``The most encouraging (thing) has been to see the reaction ofthe black majority to the efforts of the government to stifle overtunhappiness with the status quo,'' he said.   ``While the government has been fairly successful in many caseswith the state of emergency, I think the black majority seem evenmore determined, even stronger in making a difference.''   The 60-year-old Louisiana native said he was most disappointedby ``the continued existence of the state of emergency, the banningof 17 organizations a couple of years ago and the inclination toarrest a lot of people and detain them without charge.''   Perkins consistently has criticized such practices. He alsoattended political trials and protest services and traveledextensively, visiting some of the poorest and most militant blackcommunities. However, he made only a handful of public speeches anduntil last week gave no news interviews.   ``The United States should be, and intends to remain, engaged inSouth Africa,'' Perkins said. ``We must steadfastly manifest whatwe believe in as a nation so that our message is heard andunderstood all over South Africa, in every village and in everytownship.   ``We do not wish to impose an ideology, but we do want toexpress our belief in human rights, the rule of law, equal justiceunder law, and equal participation in government under aconstitution which has been decided by representatives of amajority of South Africans.''   His departure comes as the U.S. government prepares for a visitfrom National Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated the nextpresident of South Africa, and just after a meeting betweenPresident Bush and clergymen who favor more economic sanctions topressure Pretoria to end apartheid.   Sanctions have been a major issue during Perkins'ambassadorship, which started a month after Congress imposed tradeembargoes in 1986. Since then an argument has raged in South Africaand the United States about whether such sanctions hurt the blackmajority by weakening the economy or help them by forcing reforms.   ``The purpose of that act was to ensure that (African NationalCongress leader) Nelson Mandela was freed, that politicalorganizations were unbanned and that free political dialoguehappened in the country, among others,'' said Perkins, who refusedto give his personal view on the issue.   ``Mandela has not been released, and the ANC is still banned andon top of that several other organizations have been banned. If youlook at it in those terms, it's easy to say sanctions have not beeneffective,'' he said.   However, he said Americans who push for sanctions ``look uponthem as a tool which will remind the people in political power that(they have) to make some changes before they are looked upon asresponsible members of the Western world of nations.''   He said South Africa is changing ``to a different kind ofcountry, to one where the majority population will have a decisivesay in how they are governed.''   ``I am encouraged,'' he said, ``but I would say, as an outsideobserver, the road is still a pretty long one to travel.''</TEXT></DOC>
