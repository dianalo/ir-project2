He received the maximum penalty under West German law.   The three-judge District Court convicted the Lebanese ShiiteMoslem for his role in the 17-day hijacking of 39 Americans and thebrutal beating and shooting of Robert Dean Stethem of Waldorf, Md.Stethem's body was tossed from the plane onto the tarmac at BeirutAirport.   In a statement following the sentencing, Stethem's parents saidHamadi should have received the death penalty, which is not allowedunder West German law. They also warned against any political dealsthat might free him early.   Hamadi, 24, admitted to taking part in the hijacking of Flight847 from Athens to Rome but denied killing Stethem.   He looked straight ahead impassively as Chief Judge HeinerMueckenberger read the verdict to a packed courtroom insideFrankfurt's fortress-like Preungesheim prison.   Mueckenberger said the court found Hamadi guilty of ``jointparticipation in murder.'' By law, a defendant taking part in aserious crime may be convicted of murder even if he does notactually kill the victim.   ``He was an active member of Hezbollah,'' the judge said,referring to the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems believed holdingforeign hostages in Lebanon.   The court also found Hamadi guilty on three counts ofhostage-taking and inflicting grevious bodily harm, and two countsof smuggling explosives into West Germany.   Hamadi testified that the hijacking was intended to force therelease of Lebanese Moslems imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after theordeal, Israel released about 700 such prisoners.   Dozens of former passengers said Hamadi was one of two hijackerswho brutally beat Stethem. He claimed his accomplice, who remainsat large, pulled the trigger. Court records identified theaccomplice as Hassan Ezzeddine.   Mueckenberger said that while the court could not determinewhether Hamadi murdered Stethem, ``the defendant played an activerole in preparing and carrying it out.''   After sentencing, Hamadi hung his head, then stared straightahead.   Later, Stethem's father, Richard Stethem, his wife Patricia athis side, read a statement to reporters, breaking the silence theymaintained throughout the trial. They attended all 65 sessions.   ``Our family maintains Mohammed Ali Hamadi deserves punishmentmore severe than life imprisonment,'' Richard Stethem said. He alsowarned against a ``possible political commutation of his sentencein the future.''   ``Any commutation of Hamadi's sentence would be a pure mockeryof justice,'' Stethem said.   Last week, Frankfurt lawyer Rainer Hamm said the Stethems wereconcerned that kidnappings or other types of ``blackmail'' mightlead West German authorities to release Hamadi early. Hammrepresented the American co-prosecutors.   Peter Korneck, a trial prosecutor, said Hamadi could first applyfor parole in 15 years but that he would have to meet numerousconditions to be granted freedom.   Security outside the courtroom was tighter than it had been formuch of the 10-month trial, in which more than three dozenAmericans including pilots and passengers testified.   During the hijacking, Flight 847 was forced to fly three timesto Beirut and twice to Algiers, Algeria. Stethem was killed whenthe plane landed the second time in Beirut on June 15, 1985.   Another Navy diver, Clinton Suggs of Elkhart, Ind., andpassenger Kurt Carlson of Rockford, Ill., were among the mostviciously beaten.   The Hamadi case strained relations between the United States andWest Germany after Hamadi's arrest. Bonn denied a U.S. extraditionrequest after two West German businessmen were kidnapped in Beirut.   The two were taken hostage within a week of Hamadi's arrest atFrankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, when customs officials foundliquid explosives in his luggage.   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, was convicted of mastermindingthe kidnappings to force Mohammed's release. He was sentenced to 13years in prison by a Duesseldorf court.   The West German hostages, Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes, werereleased in September 1987 and September 1988, respectively.   The Hamadi trial began on July 5. Officials spent $6.3 millionto convert the dining hall at Preungesheim prison into ahigh-security courtroom with an elaborate intercom system anddouble glass walls to separate spectators from the courtroom.   Those entering the courtroom were repeatedly searched, anddozens of armed police, some mounted on horses and others carryingsubmachine guns, patrolled the area.</TEXT></DOC>
