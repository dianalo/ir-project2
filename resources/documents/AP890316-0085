Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., today formally tookhimself out of the race for the No. 2 leadership job among HouseRepublicans, but another GOP member vowed to nominate Rep. HenryHyde of Illinois for the job and make it a three-way contest.   Lewis, who as chairman of the House Republican Conference nowholds the third-ranking job in the GOP hierarchy, made no formalendorsement when he announced his decision at a news conference.   But he described the job of Republican whip, which is beingvacated by Rep. Dick Cheney so he can become President Bush'ssecretary of defense, as one that demands an ability to reach out toRepublicans of all ideologies and to Democrats as well.   That description seemed to point to Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill.,the current deputy whip and longtime inside legislative tacticianwho is running for the job with the quiet support of Minority LeaderRobert Michel.   Lewis characterized the other candidate, Rep. Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia, as a talented and energetic lawmaker but one whose talentsmight be best suited to helping run the GOP political campaignapparatus.   At the end of Lewis' news conference Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,made a surprise appearance to tell reporters that he would nominateHyde, a conservative House veteran, for the post ``whether some likeit or not.''   Hyde had decided a day earlier not to make the race, but Solomonsaid that decision was the result of pressure from the Illinoisdelegation, which didn't want Madigan's support to be diluted.   Solomon said Hyde should be the heir-apparent to Michel, who isexpected to retire in the next few years, and should therefore beinstalled now as whip.   Both Gingrich and Madigan, who have been soliciting support sinceCheney was nominated last Friday, claimed to have majority supportamong the 174-member House Republican Conference.   The contest was seen largely as one of style, and to some extentone of generations and ideology.   Gingrich, a six-term lawmaker best known for his attacks on HouseSpeaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was generally favored by conservativecolleagues who believe the party's current leadership is toounwilling to do high-profile warfare with the ruling Democrats.   Madigan was seen by many as someone who has paid his dues as thesenior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee and as aninside player on various GOP legislative initiatives.   Leadership sources said soon after Madigan announced last Fridaythat he planned to make the whip's race, Michel voiced his supportand has been quietly campaigning for his Illinois colleague, who iscloser to his style.</TEXT></DOC>
