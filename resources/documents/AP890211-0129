The Foreign Affairs Department, in a statement, said it had notreceived a copy of the full, 45-page Vatican document releasedearlier in the day, but was issuing a preliminary response based onnews reports.   ``On the basis of what is known to us, (the document)misrepresents South African government policy, clearly restated bythe newly elected leader of the governing party in his firstparliamentary statement in that capacity last week,'' the departmentsaid.   It referred to Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, recently electedto replace ailing President P.W. Botha as leader of the NationalParty.   In a speech Wednesday, de Klerk called for an end towhite-minority domination and racial prejudice, although hereaffirmed the government's commitment to segregation and made nomention of establishing black voting rights.   The Vatican document called apartheid ``institutionalized racism... justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons fromEuropean stock over those of African or Indian origin.   ``Today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form'' ofracism, the document said. ``Change is absolutely necessary andurgent.''   French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, head of the Vatican commissionthat prepared the document, said he went last year to South Africa,where 5 million whites hold political power while 26 million blackshave no vote in national affairs.   The Foreign Affairs Department, without mentioning Etchegaray,said the government ``finds it regrettable that a statement has beenmade on such a complex and difficult issue without the Vaticanleadership having been to South Africa to assess for themselves thesituation here.   ``The department nevertheless appreciates the report'scondemnation of violence and its advocacy of communication andconsultation as a method of resolving problems,'' the governmentadded.   The Vatican document, entitled ``The Church and Racism: Towards AMore Fraternal Society,'' said racism should be combatted throughnonviolent means.   ``The application of legislative, disciplinary and administrativemeasures, or even appropriate external pressure, can be timely ...but without ... going so far as to replace violently one unjustsituation with another injustice,'' it said.   Pope John Paul II has said conditions are not ripe for a papalvisit to South Africa, although his plane was forced to land therebecause of bad weather during a trip to other southern Africannations last year. There have been unconfirmed reports in SouthAfrica that the pope might visit in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
