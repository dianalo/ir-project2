Background </ITAG>On December 31, 1984, the White House Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy issued in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>a ``Proposal for a Coordinated Framework forRegulation of Biotechnology'' (49 FR 50880, December 31, 1984). In thatproposal, EPA stated that the definition of ``chemical substance'' undersection 3(2) of TSCA includes all microorganisms except those excludedfrom TSCA jurisdiction (i.e., those microorganisms manufactured, processedor distributed in commerce for use as pesticides, foods, food additives,drugs, cosmetics, or other related items are excluded). After reviewing comments on the 1984 Proposal, EPA issued in 1986, as partof the ``Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology'' (51 FR23313, June 26, 1986), a ``Statement of Policy'' describing how EPA wasaddressing certain microbial products of biotechnology under TSCA. In the1986 Policy, EPA interpreted the new chemical substance premanufacturenotification (PMN) provisions of TSCA section 5 to cover new (inter-generic)microorganisms used for commercial purposes. This interpretation becameeffective immediately. EPA also requested voluntary submission of otherinformation until final rules were in place, and described its intentionsto develop, under TSCA, a significant new use rule for pathogenic microorganisms;a rule modifying the PMN research and development exemption so that smallscale field testing of microorganisms for TSCA purposes is subject to PMN;a section 8(a) reporting rule for other microorganisms prior to releasein the environment; and section 5(h)(4) exemptions as appropriate.In developing a regulatory framework to implement the 1986 policy statement,EPA received advice and a ``concept paper'' from other federal agencies,as well as unsolicited suggestions from some nongovernmental organizations.EPA discussed proposals with the interagency biotechnology Science CoordinatingCommittee (BSCC) and received its comments. On December 21, 1988, EPA conveneda public meeting of the Subcommittee on the Proposed Biotechnology Ruleunder TSCA of the EPA Biotechnology Science Advisory Committee (BSAC),EPA's independent science advisory group. A draft proposed rule was providedto the Subcommittee. This group was asked to examine scientific issuesassociated with EPA's approach, as well as the utility of using groupsof independent experts to determine whether research and development (Randamp;D)proposals should be exempt from the premanufacture notification requirementsof section 5 of TSCA. Several members of the public requested and receivedpermission to address the Subcommittee. Included among the commenters wasthe Chairperson of the BSCC who described inter-agency discussions overthe proposed TSCA rulemaking.A number of basic issues have arisen during the course of the developmentof a proposed rule which EPA has concluded need to be addressed beforea specific rule is developed and proposed.These include:1. What should be the scope of the microorganisms subject to EPA's review?2. What should be the scope of EPA's review of Randamp;D activities involvingrelease of microorganisms to the environment?3. Since TSCA only allows EPA to review those microorganisms developedfor ``commercial purposes'', how broadly or narrowly should EPA define``commercial purposes'' in the context of research conducted at educationaland research facilities?4. If the definitions of ``release to the environment'' and ``containedfacility'' are to be used to determine whether there is EPA review of specificuses of microorganisms, how should these terms be defined? To what extentshould EPA rely on the definition of ``contained facility'' found in theguidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)?5. To what extent should EPA establish independent expert review groups(i.e., Environmental Biosafety Committees (EBCs)), similar to the NIH InstitutionalBiosafety Committees (IBCs), to assist in the review of potential environmentalreleases of microorganisms? What should be the scope of review by thosegroups?To aid EPA in addressing these issues, this notice requests comment onthem from all interested persons. For commenters who wish additional informationconcerning the background for these issues, materials in the public docketare available on request from the address in <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.</T2> These include: letters from otherFederal agencies commenting on the draft approach, the recommendationsof the BSAC Subcommittee on the Proposed Biotechnology Rule under TSCAfollowing their December 21, 1988 meeting, the draft proposed rule theydiscussed at that meeting, and the comments of the members of the publicand the BSCC chairperson at the BSAC Subcommittee meeting.
