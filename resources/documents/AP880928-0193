Rakowski announced on the evening television news he would meetThursday with officials of the government-sanctioned trade unionalliance OPZZ, which had demanded the resignation of the previousgovernment.   He told a Polish television interviewer he would also meet with``other people. But you'll learn about that tomorrow.''   The activities of Rakowski, the former party propaganda chief,dominated the report of the state-run news agency PAP, and the TVnews devoted 10 minutes of its half-hour program to him.   Parliament on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved Rakowski, 61, ahard-line opponent of the banned trade union Solidarity, asPoland's ninth prime minister since World War II.   The government led by Zbigniew Messner resigned Sept. 19following fierce criticism of its failure to achieve economicreform.   Rakowski met with the leaders of the communist-allied Peasants'Party and the Democratic Party to start building a new Cabinet.   In his acceptance speech to Parliament, Rakowski had asked fortwo weeks to form a government of people with ``reformistattitudes'' to broaden the base of the communist-dominatedgovernment.   The veteran party journalist received the Soviet AmbassadorVladimir Brovikov and departing Italian Ambassador Paolo Galli, PAPsaid.   Rakowski also presented awards for achievements in the housingindustry, saying his government's success would depend on whetherit could improve the housing situation, PAP said.   Poles can wait up to 30 years to obtain an apartment, and thehousing shortage is a major source of public discontent.   As prime minister, Rakowski faces tremendous economicchallenges. Authorities concede that confidence in the governmenthas eroded significantly due to the failure of the economic reformto produce results.   Inflation is running at 60 percent annually, consumer goods arein short supply and workers are restless after staging two waves ofpunishing strikes in the worst labor strife in seven years.   The turmoil ended Sept. 3 when the authorities promisedSolidarity leader Lech Walesa that talks would be held to considerthe union's future.   Solidarity, which was the Soviet bloc's only recognizedindependent trade movement, was suppressed when Poland declaredmartial law in 1981 and banned the following year.</TEXT></DOC>
