(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Virginia's securities division saidFriday it will use subpoena powers if necessary to force Wall Streetbrokers to reveal how much in commissions they made from a statefund that lost an estimated $212 million in 1987.   In addition, the state is asking the Securities and ExchangeCommission to investigate possible wrongdoing in the case, statesecurities chief Jack Hall said.   ``We mean to look closely at the relationship between the brokersand the people who conducted the transactions. There were atremendous number of trades conducted and a large amount ofcommissions generated,'' Hall said. ``I'm going to attempt to findout how much in the way of commissions were generated.''   Hall said he has forwarded to the SEC substantial amounts ofmaterial concerning the losses in the consolidated investment fundin April, May and June 1987.   By Dec. 31, 1987, the fund had $1.78 billion, but it hadundergone sales during the year of $80.5 billion. Treasurer A. JamesManchin said his office did not keep a record of the commissionsmade by the 42 brokerage firms handling transactions during thatperiod.   State Republican Party Chairman Edgar ``Hike'' Heiskell suggestedon Dec. 20 that the U.S. attorney's office investigate whether thefund was being ``churned,'' a brokerage term used to describemassive purchases and sales that produce no profit for theportfolio, but handsome commissions for brokers. Churning is illegal.   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey has confirmed his office is involvedin the investigation.   Hall said his office began calling brokerage houses Friday totell them he wants the information.   Hall said he will follow his initial telephone call with aletter, asking each broker to send the commission information withinfive to 10 days.   ```We're going to demand they be forthcoming on alltransactions,'' Hall said.   Hall said the SEC is reviewing material he sent to the office todetermine ``whether federal securities laws have been violated.''   The independent auditing firm Touche Ross andamp; Co., which initiallyuncovered the losses in November, is expected to make its finalreport public in mid-January. The Legislature's Commission onSpecial Investigations also is investigating the losses.</TEXT></DOC>
