It iswasteful and inefficient.''   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea andJapan have been using drift-nets in the northern Pacific Ocean tocatch squid since the early 1980s. The nets are up to 35 miles longand can cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean.   U.S. fishermen charge the nets snare North American salmon andthe illegal catches have already impacted fish runs in Alaska,Washington state and Oregon.   As the episode in the north Pacific Ocean hundreds of milessouthwest of the Aleutian Islands unfolded over the past week,Secretary of State James Baker III and Deputy Secretary of StateLawrence Eagleburger were involved in an effort to convince theTaiwanese government to allow crewmen from the cutter Jarvis toboard the Cyi Yang No. 1.   The Coast Guard was also exploring less diplomatic ways ofhalting the vessel which was believed fleeing toward Taiwan afterabandoning its drift-nets. Those methods involve spraying waterdown its smokestack, entangling its propellors or, as a lastresort, firing warning shots.   Late Wednesday, the Taiwanese government decided to allow theboarding, which took place without incident. But a representativeof the Taiwanese government made clear the granting of permissionto board would not be considered a precedent.   The Jarvis was escorting the Taiwanese ship back to the areawhere the incident began and U.S. aircraft were searching for theabandoned drift-nets. The Coast Guard is looking for any evidencethat the nets from the Cyi Yang No. 1 had caught salmon.   Northwest lawmakers have accused the drift-net fleets of``stealing'' an estimated 10,000 metric tons of salmon worth anestimated $21 million annually.   The illegally caught fish are then ``laundered'' through fishprocessors in Southeast Asia, where they are canned or frozen andsold on international markets in direct competition with U.S. fishproducts, the lawmakers have said.   Environmentalists also claim the nets are responsible for thedeaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marinelife.   Drift-net fishing has been limited to areas well away from themigration routes of salmon.   The Cyi Yang No. 1 was first spotted 450 miles outside the legalfishing zone and in waters where the Taiwanese government itselfhas banned driftnetting.   The first contact between the two vessels came early Sunday whenthe Cyi Yang No. 1 warned the Jarvis, about five miles away, thatit had drift-nets in the water.   When the Jarvis identified itself as a U.S. vessel, theTaiwanese ship cut its nets and fled. The Jarvis then beganshadowing the Cyi Yang No. 1, at times only several hundred feetaway, as the diplomatic negotiations began in Washington.   The boarding took place almost 700 miles away from where theincident began.   Since Congress enacted a law in late 1987, the State Departmenthas been trying to negotiate drift-net monitoring and enforcementagreements with Japan, Tawian and South Korea.   If such agreements are not reached by June 29, the president canthen impose trade restrictions on the imports of fish products fromthose countries.   Last year, the United States imported $502 million worth ofedible and such no-edible fisheries products as pearls from Japan,$282 million from South Korea and $445 million from Taiwan.   Talks with the Japanese earlier this month broke off and Wolfesaid that while some progress has been made, ``it's not enough atthis point.''   Wolfe said that the Taiwanese and Koreans have been essentially``stonewalling'' efforts by the U.S. to negotiate an agreement,though Wolfe is headed to Korea next week and expects talks withthe Taiwanese to resume later this spring.</TEXT></DOC>
