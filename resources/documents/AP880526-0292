Japanese and U.S. officials signed an accord Wednesday inWashington that provides for increased U.S. penetration of theconstruction market here, smoothing over a 2-year-old dispute.   ``We strongly hope that the office of the U.S. TradeRepresentative will immediately reverse its decision to name Japanas one of those countries that should be subject to exclusion''from U.S. government-funded construction projects, said HajimeSako, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors,in a statement.   Taichiro Kumagai, chairman of the Japan Civil EngineeringContractors' Association, urged the Japanese government in aseparate statement to internationalize Japan's contract biddingprocess ``with a long-term perspective,'' Kyodo News Servicereported. Among the U.S. complaints was that bid-rigging was common.   Kumagai also said U.S. construction companies should compete onan equal footing with their Japanese counterparts if the Americanconstruction industry is aggressive enough, Kyodo reported.   Sako is chairman of Taisei Corp. and Kumagai is president ofKumagai Gumi Co. Ltd. Both are among Japan's largest generalcontractors.   The Washington accord provides for Japan to encourage foreignparticipation in major public works projects financed by theJapanese government and other projects carried out by Japanesecompanies with funding from both the central and local governments.   The U.S. government had threatened to invoke legislationallowing retaliatory trade moves against Japan for what Washingtonperceived as an unfairly closed construction market.</TEXT></DOC>
