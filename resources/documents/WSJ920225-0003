The investigation is inaddition to the previously disclosed audit by the CustomsService. Last September, Millfeld took a $1.6 million chargeto cover a payment to customs after its own internal auditdetermined it had underpaid duties on imports since 1986.That prompted the customs audit.   At the time, Barry Feldstein, president and chiefexecutive officer, agreed to indemnify the company for allcustoms duties owed as a result of the audit.   Millfeld said yesterday that it is cooperating in bothinvestigations. If customs finds that significantly moreduties are owed and interest and penalties are assessed, thecompany might not have money to pay, and Mr. Feldstein maynot be able to fully indemnify, Millfeld warned.   Mr. Feldstein has been suspended pending the outcome ofthe investigation. Neil Cole, president and chief executiveof New Retail Concepts Inc., was named interim president andchief executive. Mr. Cole also becomes a director.   Millfeld officials couldn't immediately be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
