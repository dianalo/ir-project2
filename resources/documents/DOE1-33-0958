A similar pattern of tissue iron accumulation occurs in humanswith hereditary hemochromatosis. In both disorders, there is a decreaseplasma concentration of apotransferrin. To test the hypothesis that nontransferrin-boundiron exists and is clear by the parenchymal tissues, the tissue distributionof {sup 59}Fe was studied in animals lacking apotransferrin. Two groupsof animals were used: normal rats and mice whose transferrin had beensaturated by an intravenous injection of nonradiolabeled iron, and micewith congential hypotransferrinemia. In control animals, injected {sup59}Fe was found primarily in the bone marrow and spleen. In the transferriniron-saturated animals, injected {sup 59}Fe accumulated in the liverand pancreas. Gastrointestinally absorbed iron in hypotransferrinemicor transferrin iron-saturated mice was deposited in the liver. This indicatesthat newly absorbed iron is released from mucosal cells not bound totransferrin. Clearance studies demonstrated that transferrin-bound {sup59}Fe was removed from the circulation of rats with a half-time of 50min. In transferrin iron-saturated animals, injected {sup 59}Fe was removedwith a half-time of andless;30 s. Analysis of the distribution of {sup 59}Fein serum samples by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated thepresence of {sup 59}Fe not bound to transferrin. These results demonstratethe existence of and uptake system for non-transferrin-bound iron. Theseobservations support the hypothesis that parenchymal iron overload isconsequence of reduced concentrations of apotransferrin.</TEXT></DOC>
