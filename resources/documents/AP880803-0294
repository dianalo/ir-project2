On other markets, crop futures were mixed; energy prices fell;precious metals were higher; livestock and meat were mixed; andstock-index futures advanced.   Coffee prices had fallen in five of the six previous tradingsessions and ``had just gotten entirely too cheap,'' said BertRuiz, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.   The recent selloff was triggered by speculation that disputesamong the producer and consumer nations in the International CoffeeOrganization could lead to the collapse of the agreement governingtrade quotas.   Ruiz said such talk ``wasn't really rational'' since thesix-year ICO agreement does not expire until Sept. 30, 1989.Differences among ICO members are expected to be aired at an ICOcouncil meeting next month.   Coffee futures also got a boost from the trade bill that washeaded toward President Reagan's desk Wednesday, Ruiz said. Thebill contained a provision to fund customs enforcement of a rulethat all coffee imported by the United States must carry an ICOstamp.   The contract for September delivery of coffee settled 9.37 centshigher at $1.1820 a pound.   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the ChicagoBoard of Trade as predictions of rain offset the impact of thecrop-wilting heat hovering over the Farm Belt.   Wheat finished higher, soybeans were mixed and corn and oatsclosed mostly lower.   Analysts said crop conditions had deteriorated in the intense,dry heat of the past four days, but mixed weather forecasts madetraders unwilling to bet heavily on declining crop yields andhigher prices.   ``I can find you any forecast you want, from a good rain outlookover the next 24 to 48 hours to a poor rain outlook,'' said TedMao, grain specialist in New York with Sheason Lehman Hutton Inc.   ``It's all a matter of individual meteorologists'interpretations of computer models,'' he said.   After the close, the National Weather Service issued asix-to-10-day forecast calling for very hot, mostly dry conditionsin the Midwest during the five days beginning next Tuesday.   Wheat prices advanced on news that China had purchased 500,000metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat, analysts said. TheAgriculture Department announced another 500,000-ton Chinese wheatpurchase after the close.   Wheat settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher with September at $3.80{a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with Septemberat $2.97{ a bushel; oats were 5\ cents to 7 cents lower withSeptember at $2.83{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 6{cents higher with August at $8.35{ a bushel.   Energy futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange,with products outpacing crude oil in a volatile session marked bythe market's attention to OPEC developments.   Prices surged at midday in anticipation of a bullishannouncement from the OPEC pricing committee meeting in Lausanne,Switzerland.   But when the meeting ended, OPEC Secretary-General Subrotoannounced no new plans to lower crude oil production and raisepricers, and futures prices plunged.   ``The market just tanked and buyers were running and hiding,''said Peter Beutel, an analyst in New York with Elders Futures Inc.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 29 cents to 36 centslower with September at $15.26 a barrel; heating oil was 1.24 centsto 1.42 cents lower with September at 42.96 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was 1.20 cents to 2.65 cents lower with Septemberat 45.21 cents a gallon.

Cattle and frozen pork belly futures advanced on mostlytechnical factors while hogs futures prices fell due toheavier-than-expected cash sales and expectations that producerswould continue to move hogs to market despite the extreme heat,analysts said.   Live cattle were .35 cent to .80 cent higher with August at65.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to 1.25 centhigher with August at 78.47 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to.35 cent lower with August at 45.17 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were unchanged to 1.32 cents higher with August at 33.47cents a pound.
