These standards and criteria (S/C) would provide the DOEInspection and Evaluation (I and E) teams with the guidance needed toassess the security posture of DOE's nuclear and other important facilities.The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was designated the lead managementorganization for the structuring, administration, and execution of theoverall task force effort and appointed the Executive Secretary. TheOffice of Security Evaluations (OSE) became the responsible DOE organization,and its Director assumed the role of Chairman of the Task Force ExecutiveCommittee. At its peak, the Task Force consisted of approximately 200people who were considered to be experts in eight major topical areas.The composition of the experts was almost evenly divided between DOEand contractor employees. The collective wisdom of these experts wasused in a consensus process to develop the S/C that are now publishedin draft form. These S/C have been used in more than ten inspectionssince May 1986 with much success. This paper discusses the process usedto achieve the desired end result and the significance of the Task Force'saccomplishments.</TEXT></DOC>
