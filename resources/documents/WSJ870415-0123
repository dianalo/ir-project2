Starting in 1987, the law curbs exploitation of kids' low tax rates: Unearned income above $1,000 of a child under 14 is taxed at the parents' top rate. They can save for college and shave tax by shifting income to kids, but the planning is tricky. Two University of Louisville accounting professors are computing the ideal amounts and timing of parental gifts. At an 8% return, they say, gifts to a child of $12,490 at its birth, $3,453 on its 12th birthday, and $20,000 each on its 13th and 14th -- a total of $55,943 -- will raise $100,000 for it by age 18.    Richard Coppage and Sidney Baxendale say this optimum plan costs $5,629 less in income tax than if the income were taxed to the parents and amasses $9,458 more for the child. To avoid gift tax, each parent gives $10,000 a year at most. The plan uses law effective in 1988, assumes top rates of 15% for the child and 28% for the parents, and delays gifts to use the child's rate at age 14 while still reaching $100,000 by 18.    The parents take an exemption for the child; it gets no exemption but uses a $500 standard deduction.    PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS face a thorough study of administrative expenses.    The 1984 tax act directed the IRS to require private foundations to file more-detailed reports on expenses; it also directed the IRS to study expenses and report to Congress by Jan. 1, 1988. One purpose is to see how much money actually reaches charitable beneficiaries. The due date has been put off to Jan. 1, 1990; but now the IRS is starting intensive audits of the 1985 returns of 800 exempt private foundations and 100 nonexempt charitable trusts.    &quot;Highly trained examiners&quot; with &quot;a high degree of taxpayer-relations skills&quot; are to be used. They are to test and document items thoroughly, especially pay and &quot;compensation expenses&quot; -- such as travel, bargain-rate loans, and rent-free use of space -- for highly placed and well paid people. &quot;Documentation of abusive situations may appear&quot; in the report and the Congressional Record, the study manual notes.    MUTUAL-FUND INVESTORS get a new benefit for capital-gain dividends.    In the past, interest costs of borrowing to invest could be deducted to the extent of net investment income plus $10,000. Starting in 1987, the new law phases out the $10,000 allowance over five years and lowers the ceiling to net investment income alone. But it eases the crunch by expanding investment income to include long-term capital gains. That is important to mutual-fund holders who get capital-gain dividends apart from ordinary-income dividends, notes Robert Willens of Peat Marwick Main, CPAs.    A 1980 court decision determined that a mutual fund's capital-gain dividends were long-term gains; thus, they couldn't be included with ordinary dividends in investment income. The new law in effect nullifies that decision, Willens says, and lets mutual-fund holders offset investment-interest costs against capital-gain dividends.    Excess investment-interest costs can be carried forward to future years when there is net investment income.    TODAY'S THE DAY, and not for the teddy bears' picnic. Don't panic: You may send in Form 4868 today and get an automatic return-filing extension to Aug. 15, but you must estimate and pay today any tax due for 1986. States' rules for extensions vary and should be checked. Note: A payment to an individual retirement account counts for 1986 if postmarked by midnight today.    GOLD GLITTERS at market, not face, value, the Tax Court said. So John H. Lary Jr. of Huntsville, Ala., must report as gross receipts the market value of gold and silver coins received as payments in his business, Precious Objects; he may not take losses based on their face value.    DEMOTED, DEPRIVED of duties, paid to do nothing, a department head believed he was a victim of religious bias. He sued his employer and won in a federal court, but lost on appeal. In private ruling 8712009, the IRS says his legal costs are deductible as arising from his trade or business.    IT LOOKS LIKE a building, it tastes like a building, but is it a building?    The investment credit was repealed in 1986; cases like this may be a reason why. The credit was meant to stimulate spending on equipment, not buildings or structural components. Loda Poultry Co. processes and distributes chicken and meats in Illinois. In 1980, it bought a $147,180 prefabricated &quot;asset&quot; comprising five refrigerated chambers, plus $45,561 of cooling equipment, and took credits for it all. Wait, said the IRS, this is a building; if not, we have plenty of other reasons to deny credits.    The asset &quot;looked like a building&quot; to Tax Court Special Judge Panuthos, who dissected the case; but he agreed that parts legally didn't function as one: A chamber used to store &quot;fungible commodities&quot; (poultry) processed by Loda qualified for the credit. Yet a processing chamber and a loading area provided &quot;working space&quot; and functioned as a building; they didn't qualify, nor did two chambers where items processed by others were stored.    The cooling equipment was disqualified as structural components.    BRIEFS: The average worker in 1987 must toil two hours and 43 minutes of his eight-hour day to pay federal, state, and local taxes, four minutes more than in 1986, the Tax Foundation estimates. . . . The IRS has updated and reissued &quot;Self-Employment Retirement Plans,&quot; Publication 560. </TEXT></DOC>
