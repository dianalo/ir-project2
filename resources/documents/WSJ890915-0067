The Louisiana law, which withstood attack on state constitutional grounds, sets a $100,000 limit on recoveries against doctors and hospitals. Victims can recover as much as $400,000 more from a state-run insurance fund.    Designed to provide supplemental compensation for more seriously injured victims, the insurance fund is made up of surcharges the state collects on insurance premiums paid by doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers.    The Louisiana court ruled that the $400,000 cap on payments from the insurance fund is valid under the state constitution. The initial $100,000 ceiling on awards wasn't at issue in the case. The court rejected arguments that the limit on awards unfairly discriminates between less seriously injured victims, who can be fully compensated within the cap, and those for whom the limit is insufficient.    State legislatures in recent years have adopted various medical-malpractice caps in response to heavy lobbying by the medical and insurance industries. The Louisiana decision noted that courts in four states -- Indiana, California, Nebraska and Virginia -- have upheld such laws. Six states have declared them unconstitutional: Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Texas.    &quot;This is indeed a vexing and difficult issue, as witness the disparate results reached in other states,&quot; the Louisiana court said.    Such cases have been decided under federal and state constitutions and usually turn on issues of equal protection and due process. The U.S. Supreme Court so far has declined to review lower court decisions on malpractice caps, but many legal experts say the high court will have to rule on the question at some point. &quot;Because so many states are wrestling with this issue, the court eventually is going to have to consider it,&quot; says Michael E. Tigar, a University of Texas law professor.    ---   FINLEY, KUMBLE CREDITORS balk at trustee's legal bill.    The creditors committee in the bankruptcy case of the defunct law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine, Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey is grumbling over a $4 million bill from the lawyers handling the reorganization.    The bill, submitted by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy for work performed between January and June of this year, came as a big surprise, said Albert Togut, counsel for the 11-member creditors committee and a partner at the New York law firm of Togut, Segal andamp; Segal.    &quot;Until now, the firm was paid about $1 million for three months' worth of work,&quot; he said.    Mr. Togut stressed that the group's objection to the bill doesn't reflect dissatisfaction with the work of the bankruptcy trustee, Francis Musselman, a Milbank Tweed partner.    However, the creditors are concerned that the trustee's efforts to collect receivables and liquidated assets in the January-to-June period resulted in a cash gain of only $1.6 million, after fees were subtracted. So far the committee hasn't filed a formal objection with the bankruptcy court.    Mr. Musselman said that collections picked up in the past several weeks but that the rate of collections really shouldn't be the issue.    &quot;It's bizarre for them to think that Milbank should work 33,000 or so hours and not get compensated for it,&quot; Mr. Musselman said.    ---   THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION expands its minority-counsel project.    The Minority Counsel Demonstration Program, designed to promote client relationships between minority-run law firms and large corporations, has added 28 minority firms to its roster of participants.    The program currently includes 49 minority law firms, 53 corporations and about 20 major corporate law firms. When the project was launched in May 1988, 21 minority firms and 10 corporations were involved, as well as a handful of majority firms.    The program encourages large corporations to hire minority firms, which are typically smaller than the firms the companies usually retain. &quot;The goal is to demonstrate that minority firms are capable of handling sophisticated, complex legal matters,&quot; said an ABA spokeswoman. She said the program also &quot;encourages major firms to use minority lawyers in visible ways and give them client responsibility.&quot;    Corporations in the program include: Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., Allstate Life Insurance Co., Bristol-Myers Co., Coca-Cola Company, Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., Ford Motor Co., and Chrysler Corp.    According to the ABA spokeswoman, some corporations are following the example of General Motors Corp., which wrote to more than 900 law firms it uses requesting that minority lawyers be assigned to the company's work.    ---THE BANKRUPTCY GROUP at Willkie Farr andamp; Gallagher, New York, added Barry Seidel, formerly of Levin andamp; Weintraub andamp; Crames, as a partner. The group, headed by Myron Trepper, was formed less than three years ago and now has more than 15 lawyers. &quot;We think it's going to be a very large segment of Wall Street law-firm business, and we are building the group accordingly, and that's why we made this move,&quot; said Robert B. Hodes, the firm's co-chairman.    ---   THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FIRM of Beveridge andamp; Diamond opened a San Francisco office to tap the big California market for environmental work on behalf of companies and local governments. The Washington, D.C., firm, has 60 lawyers nationwide.    ---   PAUL A. BILZERIAN'S SENTENCING has been delayed for a second time because of scheduling difficulties. Federal Judge Robert Ward moved the sentencing date for the corporate investor, scheduled for today, to Sept. 27. Last June, Mr. Bilzerian, the former chairman of Singer Co., was convicted of nine counts of market-related crimes, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud, and filing false disclosure statements to the SEC. </TEXT></DOC>
