Though private forecasters remain skeptical, administration and congressional budget forecasters agree that the fiscal 1987 deficit may be lower than the approximately $173 billion projected in January. April tax receipts bulged, while outlays -- particularly non-defense -- are slightly below target.    But projections for fiscal 1988-92 look worse because of rising interest rates, lower-than-expected economic growth and corporate tax receipts, and passage of the highway and clean-water bills. A Congressional Budget Office official says those factors could add $10 billion to $20 billion a year to CBO projections of deficits ranging from $169 billion in 1988 to $85 billion in 1992.    An OMB internal analysis shows even more extra red ink, an official says.    U.S. OBJECTIONS to a Central American peace plan make progress unlikely.    Through its Salvadoran and Honduran allies, the U.S. balks at the Costa Rican proposal for a simultaneous cease-fire, amnesty for rebels and a start to peace talks. The administration sees such a plan as unenforceable but strives to make its objections look reasonable, fearing that a perception it is blocking peace will harm its already shaky prospects for more Contra aid this fall.    GOP conservatives like Sen. Hatch claim the Iran-Contra hearings actually raise public support for the Contras, but polls refute this. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows 54% of Americans disapprove of Reagan's support of the rebels -- virtually unchanged over the past six months. &quot;At home, it is not a popular issue,&quot; says House Minority Leader Michel, a Contra-aid backer.    DOLE EDGES away from Reagan as he readies his presidential bid.    White House aides are peeved at the Senate GOP leader for breaking with the president on sensitive issues. He criticizes the White House on the Navy's Persian Gulf role, speaks out against mandatory AIDS testing while Reagan moves closer to backing it for some, and helps hold up confirmation of the ambassador to Mozambique as a protest against State Department policy.    Administration aides suspect Dole is trying to distance himself from Reagan now that the president appears weakened. Dole seems increasingly preoccupied with his presidential ambitions. He discusses with zest his upcoming primary fights with Bush and looks forward to Congress's slower summer schedule, giving him more time to campaign.    But he worries that Meese's mounting legal problems could be yet another GOP albatross next year.    NIXON PLANS to contribute to the Nicaraguan rebels, he says in a letter to the bishop who delivered an anti-Contra eulogy at former CIA chief Casey's funeral. The former president also sends the clergyman a copy of his recent pro-Contra speech to newspaper publishers.    RELATIONS COOL between the formerly cozy Home Loan Bank Board and U.S. League of Savings Institutions. The trade group claims the board depletes its resources to justify more congressional aid for its battered insurance fund, and may sue in an $800 million dispute over premiums. The league also fears new board members will be much more deregulation-minded.    CONSERVATIVE TILT? By a margin of 53% to 38%, likely voters in the latest Journal/NBC poll would be more worried by a president who goes too far in increasing domestic spending than by one who goes too far in cutting it back. And by a 51%-42% margin, they would worry more about someone too eager for arms control than about someone who might not do enough.    THE PENTAGON HOPES that recent Persian Gulf violence will help it water down legislation taking away much of its control over sensitive exports to non-Soviet bloc countries. &quot;This bill would give the Commerce Department full control over exports to Iran and Iraq,&quot; argues one Defense official. The agencies already battle over a proposed sale of computers to Iran.    LABOR SEEKS to maximize campaign clout, though an endorsement is unlikely.    No candidate seems likely to get the two-thirds approval needed from the AFL-CIO for a pre-convention endorsement. Instead, its executive council is likely in August to cut loose individual unions to endorse candidates on their own -- a step that could help them get as many delegates as possible to the Democratic convention. Some may jointly back several acceptable candidates.    In Iowa, where the caucus system gives disproportionate power to unions, Gephardt makes inroads with auto workers and the building trades. Government workers seem receptive to both Biden and Dukakis, with electrical workers leaning toward Dukakis. Teachers so far remain neutral.    &quot;This is the most tentative election we've ever been in,&quot; says an American Federation of Teachers official.    MINOR MEMOS: University of California political scientist Raymond Wolfinger complains that some of his students are so ill-informed they think Fawn Hall is the campus agriculture building. . . . At a stop at a biotechnology firm, Bush splices a gene and is awarded a &quot;certificate of splicemanship.&quot; . . . Another new Nixon? Missouri Democratic state legislator Jay Nixon -- no relation -- mulls a race against GOP Sen. Danforth next year. </TEXT></DOC>
