Yet in choosing this undynamic duo primary voters were not unconditionally embracing the principle of tedium; these two uninspiring candidates emerged from an unprecedentedly uninspiring field.    With the exception of celebrity populist Jesse Jackson, the sardonic Bob Dole and the frolicsome Gary Hart, the defeated candidates had little more to offer in the way of personal magnetism than Messrs. Bush and Dukakis. Basically, they broke down into three groups: the well-groomed (Kemp, Gore, Gephart, Robertson), the nerdish (Simon, du Pont), and the unfathomable (Babbitt, Haig). Any way you look at it, this was no Spuds MacKenzie crowd.    But for those who are concerned about the erosion of our bedrock values -- one of which is an abiding looniness -- the season has produced a bevy of minor candidates who are not dull, gray, interchangeable. They may yet have their day in the sun.    This invigorating information comes to us from &quot;Minor Presidential Candidates and Parties of 1988&quot; (McFarland andamp; Co., Box 611, Jefferson, N.C. 28640, 228 pages, $19.95), compiled by Glenn Day. Using the Federal Election Commission Address List of Presidential Candidates and other resources, Mr. Day wrote letters to each of the 200-plus candidates, asking them to discuss their philosophies.    About 60 of the candidates responded, including the usual cryptofascists, save-the-whalers, Bible-thumpers and commie-nukers who turn up every four years. Far more interesting are the doomed but refreshing candidacies of such individuals as Roy James Clenendan, whose platform evinces a decidedly bracing orthodontic slant. Specifically, the native of Parma, Ohio, calls for &quot;income tax audits of many dentists&quot; and demands that &quot;dentists advertise price of fillings and dentures.&quot; He also would force doctors to &quot;take correspondence courses on drugs and their side effects.&quot; On a reassuring note, he tells voters that if elected he would be purely a &quot;figurehead president,&quot; who would delegate all responsibility to others. Now that would make a change.    Roger Lee Huddleston believes that urban children would be safer if the U.S. positioned huge blimps above our cities. He also says blimps could &quot;help in the future to provide air traffic ways to work and back for helocopters (electric steam) work transportation&quot; (sic). And in a nation where sloth, greed and lust often are cited as portents of moral decline, Mr. Huddleston is the first candidate to address the issue of rampant pettifoggery.    &quot;Pettifoggery seems to be prevalent in this country,&quot; declares the Hot Springs, Ark., man. &quot;Action should be taken to insure against pettifoggery of image or vocal introduction to honest citizens and loyal subjects of this country, which concern the national defense, rather than a practice session for unleadership-like influences.&quot; He'll get no argument from me.    Another interesting candidacy is that of Michael J. Frei, of Oscoda, Mich., who claims to have been run out of the Air Force by a ring of treasonous, gay aviators. Mr. Frei, whose slogan is &quot;Get Straight by '88,&quot; shares the moral high ground with Larry Joe Buffington, who is concerned about &quot;nudity in our dress styles,&quot; and perhaps with Dr. Isabell Masters, whose cryptic campaign button reads: &quot;Integrated Biscuits, '88.&quot;    Speaking of slogans, those signs reading &quot;John 3:16&quot; that always pop up on TV screens during football games are the work of William King, who drives all around the U.S. attending sporting events where he can practice his bizarre form of TV evangelism. Guess who's running for president on the slogan: &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life&quot;?    Though John L. LeMen's 21-point platform includes support for a &quot;strong military at a $4.95 hammer&quot; and &quot;automatic eye care, O.D. and M.D.,&quot; his most appealing plank is No. 20, which reads: &quot;Open for suggestions.&quot; William J. DuPont, citing eerie similarities between his life and John Kennedy's, would pick up the fallen torch by repealing the 55-m.p.h. laws. Targeting the UFO vote, Kip Lee would invite extraterrestrials to appear before Congress and &quot;explain what they can do for us as a team.&quot; Mr. Lee seems unaware that extraterrestrials already regularly testify before Congress. And most of them have some affiliation with Harvard.    A somewhat discordant note is registered by Ary Dov Rosenbaum, who is running as a protest candidate, noting, &quot;I didn't take any trips with Donna Rice and I didn't steal speeches from past candidates.&quot; Just 15 years of age, Ary is too young to be president and almost certainly too young to take trips with Ms. Rice. But as any writer will tell you, you're never too young to start stealing other people's material.    Of all the candidates, the most memorable is Robert Eugene Cotner, who demands listing in the Guinness Book of World Records because he is &quot;the only person to start his campaign three different times from inside a prison.&quot; Making no effort to conceal his true motives, Mr. Cotner says he is the only candidate to &quot;take applications for a wife as part of his campaign.&quot; Pat Paulsen, you have not lived in vain. Neither have you, Glenn Day.    ---   Mr. Queenan is a writer for Barron's. </TEXT></DOC>
