Under the pact, Cray, based in Eagan, Minn., willguarantee that it will support the data storage and retrievalsystem in its current and future computers. In the next fiveyears, Mr. Rasch said, E-Systems sees a $2 billion market forsuch mass storage systems. About 30% to 40% of that marketrepresents Cray users, he said.   The mass storage systems use robotics to provide rapidaccess to data stored in huge disk and tape libraries, makingthem ideal for supercomputers that need massive amounts ofdata.   E-Systems has an existing joint marketing pact with ConvexComputer Corp. of Dallas, a maker of mini-supercomputers.</TEXT></DOC>
