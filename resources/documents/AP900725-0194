Kazuo Wada got the green, wallet-sized card this spring when heand his Yaohan International, a $1.6 billion retailing giant, movedits headquarters from Japan to the British crown colony.   ``The possibility of success for business is far greater thanthe risks,'' Wada said in explaining why he moved to Hong Kongduring the jittery runup to 1997, when the colony reverts toChinese rule.   Despite the anxiety of residents about the future, Wada and manyother foreigners are betting Hong Kong will continue to be a goodplace to do business.   ``I think people generally feel Hong Kong will remain a goingconcern,'' said John T. Kamm, president of the American Chamber ofCommerce. ``For businessmen, it's paradise.''   Some aspects of paradise are a corporate tax rate of only 16.5percent, one of the world's most advanced infrastructures, acentral location in Asia and a laissez-faire government attitude.   Businessmen believe Hong Kong is the prime base for businesswith China, which has promised the territory can keep itscapitalist system for at least 50 years.   They point to China's decision to let dissident astrophysicistFang Lizhi leave the country after a year in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing, and to the soaring Hong Kong stock market.   Overseas investors acknowledge that, because they areforeigners, they can bail out if the business climate deteriorates.Hong Kong residents who lack the escape route a foreign passportprovides are much less sanguine.   Yaohan's splashy arrival underlined the continued strongpresence of Japanese companies in Hong Kong retailing.   An estimated 40 percent of the colony's department storebusiness is controlled by Japanese companies, which entered themarket as early as 30 years ago. Yaohan alone plans to increase itsnumber of Hong Kong stores from three to five by 1991.   Japanese banks and financial institutions are establishing localbranches and individual investors have been buying real estate,said Shigetu Suda, senior manager at Nomura Research Institute HongKong Ltd.   For the fiscal year ending in March, Japanese investment wasabout $1.9 billion, up 14.2 percent from the previous year despiteChina's brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in 1989,according to Japanese government figures. Six years ago, annualinvestment was about $400 million.   The other major foreign investor, besides China, is the UnitedStates, with an estimated total of $6 billion to $7 billion in thecolony.   Citibank is investing at least $150 million in a building thatwill house much of its local operation. Americans with less capitalare opening restaurants and other businesses.   Although Kamm believes the crackdown in China has had littleeffect on foreign investors in Hong Kong, there are indications ofcaution. The number of U.S.-owned factories has increased onlyslightly and membership in the American Chamber of Commerce hasfallen slightly.   More than half the 49 multinational companies responding to asurvey this year by the consulting firm Business International saidmoving their offices out of the colony was a possibility.   Rising costs and staff availability were primary concerns, butuncertainty about 1997 ``obviously was a consideration,'' BusinessInternational said.   Observers say much foreign investment could be withdrawn quicklyin a crisis, and risk analyst Robert Broadfoot noted that Japaneseinvestment throughout Asia grew much faster last year than it didin Hong Kong.   He dismisses claims that the importance China attaches to thehuge foreign economic presence is the best guarantee for HongKong's 5.7 million people of a stable and prosperous future.   ``You cannot have an economic guarantee,'' he said. ``One doesnot exist. China is motivated first, second and third by politicalconsiderations.''   Wada, the Yaohan chairman, remains confident. When asked wherehe expected to be in 10 years, he flashed a broad, infectious smileand said: ``Because Hong Kong will belong to China, I should sayHong Kong AND China.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday Aug 1</NOTE></DOC>
