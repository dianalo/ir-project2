A State Department official said Monday that Assistant SecretaryRichard W. Murphy raised the issue with the defense minister ofQatar last weekend at a meeting in the Persian Gulf sheikdom'scapital of Doha.   Murphy, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern andSouth Asian Affairs, demanded the Stingers be returned to theUnited States, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   ``They have them. They got them from some place and we want themback,'' the official said.   Murphy also reiterated the United States' demand for access tothe missiles to determine through their serial numbers who had soldthem to Qatar, the department official said.   The United States prohibits other governments in its Stingercontracts from transferring the weapons to a third party.   The New York Times reported today that the defense minister,Crown Prince Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, rejected Murphy's demandson the grounds that Qatar needed the missiles to defend itselfagainst threats to its security.   The United States learned Qatar had Stinger missiles in March,when U.S. Embassy officials in Bahrain noticed one in a militaryparade in Qatar. When confronted, officials in Doha admitted theyhad secretly bought 12 missiles, but refused to identify thesource, according to the Times.   In May, Murphy said the highly accurate, shoulder-fired rocketsmay have been passed to Qatar by Iran, which in turn obtained themfrom the U.S.-supplied Afghan rebels.   Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved languageto prohibit any military dealings with Qatar until the Stingerswere returned. State department officials told the Times the UnitedStates has no plans to recall its ambassador over the disagreement.   Qatar does not buy any weapons nor does it receive any militaryor economic aid from Washington, but it has traditionally soughtgood relations with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
