(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevslowly may be winning converts to his policy of glasnost, oropenness, but whether the word merits inclusion in a U.S. dictionaryremains under debate.   The honor likely to be accorded such all-American terms as``televangelist'' and ``computer virus'' in upcoming Merriam-Websterdictionaries has so far been denied the word describing Gorbachev'sreforms.   ``It is still most often found in either italics or quotes and tous that means it has not been completely Americanized,'' said JamesG. Lowe, senior editor at Springfield-based G.C. Merriam Inc. ``Whenreporters and writers start using it without explaining what itmeans it will be ready for consideration for the dictionary.''   The term ``computer virus'' came into wide use too late for thisyear's book, but it is an almost sure bet for inclusion in the nextaddendum to the company's unabridged dictionary, Lowe said, thanksto a graduate student who this autumn unleashed a ``virus'' thatclogged university and military computers and exposed thevulnerability of computer banks to infection.   ``Televangelist,'' ``colorization,'' as used to describe thetinting of old black-and-white films, and ``zap,'' when used todescribe what happens to a television commercial when a viewerswitches to another channel by remote control, are also likelycandidates for the unabridged dictionary, he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Monday was a holiday within a holiday formany parents who had the day off but sent their children back toschool.   The federal and state New Year's Day holiday was observed by manyschool systems, but it was back to the books for students in publicschools here.   ``I don't want to go,'' said Joe Alexander, 14, as he boarded aschool bus bound for Attucks Junior High. ``It's not fair for us togo on a federal holiday.''   A lot of students _ and parents _ apparently had the sameopinion, as the absentee rate shot up to near 40 percent at someschools. Overall, attendance was termed ``fair'' by officials.   Frank Tout, principal at Howe High School, estimated that between60 percent and 65 percent of the school's 1,609 students were inclass.   Although Christmas vacation started earlier at city schools thanat other school systems, another day off would have been nice, moststudents agreed.   ``I don't like it,'' said Jesse Harper, 12, another Attucksstudent. ``My dad is staying home today and I wanted to stay withhim.''   But some were more than ready to return.   ``I wanted to go to school today,'' said Missy Frazier, 14, aneighth-grader at Attucks. ``I get bored at home.''</TEXT></DOC>
