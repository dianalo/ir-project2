Bennett promised senators Wednesdayto shun the role of a mere figurehead in the national drug-fightingjob to which President Bush has nominated him.   However, commenting at his confirmation hearing, Bennettsidestepped questions on a substantive issue _ legislation to banmilitary-style assault rifles sometimes used by drug pushers.   ``Why would you take this job to be a figurehead?'' Bennett askedthe Senate Judiciary Committee. ``The pay is not so good; the hoursare horrible and the subject matter is depressing.''   Lawmakers questioned the former secretary of education closely onwhether as head of the government's war on drug abuse he would bewilling and able to engage in vigorous political infighting withCabinet secretaries who might be protective of their own power andprerogatives.   He promised that he would speak out within administrationcouncils.   ``I don't think lack of candor has been my problem,'' theoutspoken Bennett told the hearing, drawing laughter from theaudience.   The tone was more somber, however, when Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., asked Bennett if he would support legislation that wouldoutlaw semiautomatic weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis favored by drugpushers.   Kennedy also quoted a 1988 memo in which Bennett had proposedconsidering efforts to outlaw ``automatic'' and certain otherweapons.   The current dispute in Congress is over semiautomatic weapons. Itis still possible for private individuals to own fully automaticweapons but only after meeting an array of difficult-to-fulfillrequirements.   ``What logical or reasonable way is there for a citizen to own anAK-47?'' Kennedy asked Bennett.   ``That's a good question,'' Bennett replied.   ``I'm waiting for an answer,'' Kennedy said.   ``I'll give you one in six months,'' Bennett said.   Bennett also told lawmakers there can be no quick victory in thewar against narcotics.   ``It will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around,'' hesaid.   Opening the hearing, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen.Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he understood that it would take time toget the job done and that there would be some failures along the way.   Biden said if Bennett used the full powers of his office tocombat drug abuse, ``we will run all the political interference youneed,'' but if the effort ran out of steam, ``then you have a criticsitting up here.''   Bennett appeared a virtual shoo-in for approval by the panel,with his sharpest critic, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., saying ``I thinkI might be the only one to vote no.'' And even he left the door opento voting in support of Bennett's nomination as director of theOffice of National Drug Policy.   The office was created under wide-ranging crime legislationapproved last fall and requires the director to draw up a nationalstrategy aimed at coordinating the war on drugs.   The opening of the hearing entailed little more than openingstatements and primarily afforded senators a chance to air theirspecial concerns as well as lap up a sizeable helping of theattention that the drug issue always provides. Sen. Alan Simpson,R-Wyo., told the panel that ``everybody likes to mess with itbecause you get seven-camera (congressional) hearings out of it.''   In two hours of welcoming remarks by about a dozen lawmakers,Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., put in a plug for a $10 billionprison-construction idea, saying rehabilitation of crime-proneaddicts was important but if they ``become career criminals, youhave to throw away the key.''   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, sponsor of a bill to outlawsale of military-style assault rifles, warned Bennett not to ignorethe tie between drug abuse and the use of semiautomatic weapons bycriminals.   The ceremonial comments dragged on so long that Sen. GordonHumphrey, R-N.H., merely inserted his statement in the record,saying, ``Two hours of welcoming remarks are about as stupefying assome drugs.''   Simon said he remained undecided about whether to support theveteran federal official as drug czar, saying he had once voted withenthusiasm to confirm Bennett as head of the National Endowment forthe Humanities.   ``I was less enthusiastic at the end of your term,'' Simon said.   ``If we were to elect a national gadfly on the drug issue, youwould get my vote very quickly,'' Simon said. ``The more troublingquestion is whether you can be an effective administrator.''   Simon said he also was disappointed by Bennett's performance assecretary of education.   ``I want from your office not a blizzard of press releases,''Simon said. ``I want a solid job on what is really a massive problemin our society.''   Humphrey said Bennett's habit of using his Cabinet post as a``bully pulpit'' to crusade for upgrading education might bedescribed ``as the activities of a gadfly, a term which I don'tshare, but nonetheless it has importance.'' He hailed the nominee's``solid record of accomplishment.''</TEXT></DOC>
