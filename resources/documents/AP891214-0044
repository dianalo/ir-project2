In a three-pronged attack launched shortly before midnightTuesday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam surrounded theeastern coastal town of 60,000 people and clashed with the TamilNational Army.   The Tigers seized control of the town and drove out the NationalArmy members who had been based in Batticaloa. Witnesses and SriLankan officials said most of the dead were National Army members.   India sent peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka two years ago tohelp end an insurgency by Tamil separatists. The Sri Lankangovernment claims Indian troops, who left the Batticaloa area lastmonth, created the Tamil National Army to fight the Tigers.   India denies the allegations and Sri Lanka has outlawed theNational Army.   At Batticaloa's General Hospital today, blood trickled out of adrain from the mortuary and ran into a small concrete trench. Agroup of somber women entered the building and screamed as theyrecognized the bodies of loved ones.   Military officials said 130 Tamils were killed.   Nearly all the casualties were purportedly killed aftersurrendering to the Tamil Tigers, relatives and hospital officialssaid.   ``Everyone was shot at very close range,'' said one man who saidhe saw 42 bodies. He said all but four had their hands tied behindtheir backs.   According to an account pieced together from witnesses,relatives and hospital employees, at least 50 members of theNational Army had surrendered to the Tigers, who then disarmed themand bound their hands.   ``What happened was they surrendered but one of them pulled agun and shot a Tiger. The Tigers just went wild,'' said one man whoasked not to be identified further.   Outside the Batticaloa mortuary, weeping women who had justidentified the bodies of sons and husbands said they were stillglad the Tigers had ousted the Tamil National Army because now thefighting would end.   The women said their sons, many of them high school students,had been forcibly recruited by the Tamil National Army. Otherresidents and police gave the same story.   Tamil Tigers say they want an independent nation because ofdiscrimination against the Tamil minority by the Sinhalese, whoaccount for about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people andcontrol the government and military.   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's population. Sinhaleseare mainly Buddhists and Tamils are mostly Hindus.   At least 17,000 people have died in Sri Lanka in the past sixyears in the Tamil separatist rebellion and a backlash by militantSinhalese upset with concessions made to the Tamils.   The National Army is comprised of members of former rebel groupsthat agreed to end their secessionist war and accepted anIndia-mediated peace agreement with the government in July 1987.   But the most powerful of the four rebel groups, the Tigers,reneged on the agreement and began attacking Indian peacekeepingsoldiers sent in to enforce the accord.   Hospital officials said about 50 bodies had been brought to thehospital but they were arriving so fast the officials were unableto keep the records exact. The small mortuary overflowed withbodies and the smell of death wafted out of the door and into thehot morning sun.   ``The freezer has not been working for the last few years,''said a nurse.   Asked if this was the worst single killing in Batticaloa, heshook his head and said ``there has been so many.''   Residents said Sri Lankan troops stayed indoors during Tuesday'sand Wednesday's violence.   In Colombo, a Sri Lankan military official confirmed thefighting and said government troops did not get involved.   ``We do not want to be accused of using our largelySinhalese-dominated armed forces to fight the Tamils,'' said theofficial, speaking on condition anonymity.   India withdrew its troops from Batticaloa under a phased pulloutprogram. India has agreed to withdraw the remaining 22,000 soldiersfrom Sri Lanka by Dec. 31.   In June, the Tigers agreed to cease attacks on government troopsafter negotiations with President Ranasinghe Premadasa and othersenior officials.</TEXT></DOC>
