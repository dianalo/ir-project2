(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An autopsy Wednesday failed to pinpoint whatkilled a boy who collapsed while riding the Z-Force roller coasterat the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park.   William D. ``Brett'' Pope, 11, of Talladega, Ala., was pronounceddead Tuesday night about an hour after being taken off the ride,which makes six sharp, corkscrew dives.   The ride, which was shut down immediately, will remain closeduntil park and state officials finish an investigation, said SixFlags spokesman Bob Maxwell.   ``The ride appears to be operating perfectly, but we won't takeany chances,'' Maxwell said.   A preliminary autopsy by the Cobb County medical examiner'soffice failed to find a cause of death, said medical examiner'sspokeswoman Sally Lummus.   Doctors were still piecing together the child's medical history,the spokeswoman said. Once that is completed, the body will be sentto the state crime lab for further analysis, she said.   Six Flags spokesman Bob Maxwell said the boy appeared fine whenhe boarded the ride with his family at 9:40 p.m., but wasunconscious when the ride ended minutes later.   Maxwell said park personnel used cardiopulmonary resuscitationuntil an ambulance arrived to take the boy to HCA Parkway MedicalCenter, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.   Hospital spokeswoman Mimi Salkin said the child showed no outwardsigns of injury.   The roller coaster carries a warning that pregnant women andpeople with heart or back problems shouldn't ride.   Maxwell said the operators of the ride and other passengers werebeing interviewed to determine if anything unusual occurred, but noother injuries were reported.   He said the boy's shoulder harness and lap belt were in placewhen the ride ended.   Pope, the son of Ron and Sandra Pope of Talladega, had justcompleted the fifth grade, relatives said. His parents declined totalk about his death.</TEXT></DOC>
