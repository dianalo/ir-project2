In a Wall Street Journal survey of 214 early-reporting companies, earnings from operations in the second quarter of 3.75 billion Canadian dollars (US$3.11 billion) were up 30% from a year earlier and up 17% from the first quarter. For the six months, operating earnings of C$6.95 billion were up 31% from 1987.    Economists generally see the Canadian economy growing about 3.5% this year and about 2.5% to 3% in 1989. That's sufficient growth to sustain corporate profits at healthy levels.    In the second quarter, metals prices continued the sharp upward move that began in the 1987 fourth quarter. For 22 mining companies, earnings rose 187% to C$675.6 million for the second quarter from a year ago and were up 260% to C$1.13 billion for the six months.    Results were even better for the 16 base-metal miners in the group, as their second-quarter profits jumped 221% from a year ago to C$612.6 million. Rising demand and low inventories of many metals, especially nickel and aluminum, were the primary reasons for the price increases. Inco Ltd., the Western world's biggest nickel miner, posted second-quarter net of US$181.4 million, a huge gain from US$13.8 million a year earlier. Falconbridge Ltd., a nickel and copper concern, recorded a second-quarter profit of C$95 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of C$17.8 million.    Hank Reimer, a mining analyst with Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon andamp; Co., said London Metal Exchange spot nickel prices averaged US$7.65 a pound in the latest quarter, up from $1.93 a pound in the year-earlier period. Over the same time, the average aluminum price rose to $1.39 from 65 cents a pound.    &quot;The mining industry is at or near capacity levels and there isn't a lot of new capacity coming on stream&quot; in the next few years, he said. This lack of new supply bodes well for metals prices in the near term, he added. With even a modest growth in demand, metal prices will stay firm and earnings in the mining industry should do &quot;very well&quot; again in 1989, he said.    In the forest-products sector, earnings for 17 concerns rose 32% to C$420 million for the quarter from a year earlier and were up 37% to C$811.9 million for the first half. Second-quarter profits were up just 7% from the first quarter but the industry has now marked its 11th consecutive quarter of higher year-to-year profits.    The continuing rise in the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, to about 81 cents (U.S.) in the second quarter from 75 cents a year earlier, is of particular concern to both the metals and forest products industries as their products are priced in U.S. dollars.    In contrast to the mining and forest industries, earnings for 18 oil and natural gas concerns fell 12% to C$432.5 million for the quarter and were off 16% to C$843.4 million for the first half. Overproduction by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and lower demand have combined to keep oil prices and profits flat.    Typical of the group was Imperial Oil Ltd., 70% -- owned by Exxon Corp. Its second-quarter net fell 13% to C$168 million. Shell Canada Ltd., 79% -- owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, bucked the general trend as its earnings rose 66% to C$106 million for the quarter. An outstanding performance from its petrochemicals division was the main reason for the gain.    Some 72 companies in the manufacturing sector posted a second-quarter earnings gain of 31% to C$925.1 million. Most of the gains came from the industrial-products component, with quarterly profits rising 45% for the second quarter and 48% for the first half. Alcan Aluminium Ltd. posted second-quarter profit of US$243 million, more than double the US$104 million of a year earlier.    Manufacturers of consumer products had a disappointing performance, posting an earnings gain for the quarter of just 2% to C$235.8 million. First-half earnings were up just 1% to C$409.6 million. </TEXT></DOC>
