It was the second weekend of protests at the Carmelite convent,but there was no repeat of the July 14 incident in which anAmerican rabbi and six students were dragged away by conventconstruction workers after occupying the grounds for five hours.   Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Authority Sunday issued a protestto Poland over the presence of the cloister.   The convent was founded in 1984 in a former Nazi warehouse a fewfeet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp,where an estimated 4 million people _ including 2.5 million Jews _were put to death during World War II.   The cloister's lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle,is a former gravel pit where prisoners were gunned down by Naziexecutioners in 1940 and 1941.   ``We have nothing against the Carmelites, but we are againstthem praying at this place,'' said Borem Laurent, a Brusselsresident and chairman of the Union of Jewish students of Belgium.   The group also included students from Holland, Switzerland andEngland.   The 107 demonstrators, organized by the European Union of JewishStudents, sat for 20 minutes about 15 feet outside the convent gate.   Several hundred area residents, including couples with children,stood nearby, saying they came to ``defend'' the convent.   ``It is as though really they don't want to understand,''Bernard Suchecky said of the Poles watching the protest. ``I don'tunderstand the obstinacy of marking every square inch with across.''   Yitzhak Arad of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Authority said inJerusalem: ``The event in which Jews were attacked at the Auschwitzcamp could have been avoided if the church authorities concernedwith the matter fulfilled their promise in time.''   Arad, in a cable to Wladyslaw Loranc, Poland's minister ofreligious affairs, appealed for a ``speedy transfer of the conventfrom the Auschwitz extermination camp in order to avoid suchsorrowful cases in which either side is not interested.''   An agreement signed in Geneva in 1987 set a Feb. 22 deadline formoving the nuns to a planned interfaith center away from the deathcamp. The deadline passed, and construction on the new interfaithcenter had not started.   On Friday, the state-run Polish news agency reported that landnearly 2,000 feet from the Auschwitz fence was purchased for thecenter this month and that construction will begin next year.   ``The nuns don't pray just for Poles here, they pray for allpeople who perished here,'' one member of the spectating crowd toldthe demonstrators.   Another yelled out, ``They'll demand that the pope be removedtoo before long!''   When the students left, the nuns unlocked their gate to let outseveral people. As a nun approached the fence, a woman outside toldher: ``Just call us again if someone else bothers you and we willcome back to defend you.''   The nun would not answer reporters' questions.</TEXT></DOC>
