<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-34-0851 </DOCNO><TEXT>The process of acid deposition encompasses both the wet and dry depositionof acid substances. Acid deposition may take the form of rain, snow,hail or other wet precipitation, or as dust, impacted fine particulateaerosol, or absorption of gas. Sulphur and nitrogen oxides are the precursorsof acid deposition. The resulting pollutant mix consists both of theoxides of sulphur and nitrogen and their transformation products, includingsuphuric acid and nitric acid aerosols, ammonium sulphates, ozone, andsmall particulate matter, a large portion of which falls in the inhalablerange. The potential health effects of acid deposition may be eitherdirect or indirect. Studies are described that were conducted to assessthe direct health effects due to long-range transported pollutants. Theywere designed to investigate the feasibility of conducting future large-scaleepidemiological studies and to provide functional experimental modelsto evaluate both chronic and acute health responses to long-range transportedpollutants. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
