It apparently doesn't matter that the entrepreneurs are black, in a city with a black mayor and a stated policy of encouraging minority-owned businesses. It's more that this is the tightly sealed world of cable television.    With a handful of exceptions, the roughly 9,000 cable franchises in the U.S. are monopolies, granted by local governments to a favored company, one usually partly owned by politically well-connected people. Governments pass out such monopolies and fiercely defend them, yet don't regulate prices charged to customers. The &quot;franchise fees&quot; that local governments charge cable operators rise with the revenues, and total hundreds of millions of dollars annually.    But the winds of competition are rustling in the cable business. Two or three dozen communities now allow second cable companies to compete, estimates John Mansell, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm. Public unhappiness over service and rising prices is fueling the push for competition. Just last week, the General Accounting Office released a study saying rates charged by cable operators for basic service jumped 29% between December 1986 and October 1988.    Preferred Communications Inc. has a suit pending in federal district court here aimed at forcing the city to grant it a franchise. Preferred is owned by a group of local, mostly black investors, headed by two brothers, Clinton and Carl Galloway. A win by Preferred could make it easier for competitors to get in the door nationwide.    Nationally, the status quo is a recipe for bad government and bad cable service, critics contend. &quot;It is one of the most corrupt processes imaginable,&quot; says Sol Schildhause, former chief of the cable-TV branch of the Federal Communications Commission and now a private attorney whose firm represents Preferred in its suit.    Defenders argue that cable television is one of those businesses, like a utility, that works best as a monopoly. Given the expense and street disruption required to lay cable to every home in an area, putting in more than one system is simply a waste of resources and an annoyance for residents in the area, they say.    Operators argue that in some places competition was tried, but it failed, leaving a monopoly anyway. &quot;It's simply not viable to have two franchises in one area,&quot; says Marc Nathanson, chairman of Los Angeles-based Falcon Cable TV, which operates cable franchises nationwide.    Nor is price regulation necessary, cable operators say, because cable prices are held down by competition with regular, free broadcasters and other media. Recent price surges were simply a &quot;catch-up&quot; for prior years when cable rates were regulated and artificially depressed, operators contend.    In Vidalia, Ga., John Collins and his Southland Cablevision Inc. are going head to head with a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., the biggest cable operator in the U.S. Since Southland was launched in March 1988, it has taken about 2,000 of TCI's 4,800 cable customers, according to Mr. Collins, a former building contractor. TCI says the number is lower than that, but won't be more specific.    Faced with a rival, TCI has slashed prices. Mr. Collins says he meets those cuts in the parts of his service where he can afford to and resorts to guerrilla tactics when he can't cut prices. After a recent 37% price cut by TCI on basic monthly service, Mr. Collins trumpeted his competitor's action in newspaper ads that ran in Georgia cities where TCI has cable monopolies and didn't cut prices. &quot;That should get them a few phone calls,&quot; Mr. Collins says.    TCI says it has received some calls because of the advertisements but doesn't expect any lasting damage. The cable giant also vows to do all it can, within the law, to beat competitors. And, a spokesman adds, &quot;We expect to see more competition from the Collinses of the world.&quot;    Would-be competitors hope that's the case, but headway has been slow, especially in the courts.    The Galloways, for instance, have been trying for nearly a decade to get a franchise to serve the Watts district of Los Angeles and other parts of the city's largely black south-central area. Their suit, which is already six years old, was originally dismissed. Today, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of reinstating the case, the brothers are still waiting for the judge in the case to set a trial date. &quot;I sometimes think it would be easier to get a trial in Russia,&quot; says Clinton Galloway, president and chief executive officer of Preferred Communications.    Los Angeles city officials say competition hasn't worked in other cities and won't work here. With streets torn up to install lines, &quot;there is a lot of disruption from building a second cable system,&quot; says Ed Perez, the assistant city attorney handling the Preferred suit.    The Galloway side argues that the city allows other private interests, from skyscraper construction to movie making, to inconvenience citizens in the pursuit of profit. And as for economic viability, they want the marketplace to be the arbiter.    The Galloways, not surprisingly, say their real mistake was not playing politics with the powers that be. In the late 1970s when the city invited interested parties to compete for the south-central franchise, the Galloways formed an investment group and submitted a bid. But from early on there was city hall pressure to drop that bid and &quot;get on the team,&quot; recalls Clinton Galloway. The &quot;team,&quot; he says, included friends and political allies of some of the black city council members and Mayor Tom Bradley. At one point, the mayor himself held a private meeting with the Galloways and the others to urge such a combination.    The Galloways declined. &quot;We wanted to run our own cable company,&quot; says Clinton Galloway.    Later, in a deposition as part of the suit, Mr. Bradley testified that he was merely trying to &quot;enhance&quot; the chances of the franchise going to a black-owned firm.    In fact, the city council and mayor awarded the franchise to a white-controlled company named A Community Cable Entertainment/Services System Inc., and known as Access. Kaufman andamp; Broad Inc., the big Los Angeles-based homebuilder, originally owned 80% of Access; that stake is now held by Continental Cablevision, a big Boston-based cable operator. (Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper, formerly owned a 17% stake in Continental.) The remaining 20% of Access went to many of the same parties that had been proposed as partners to the Galloways.    Mr. Perez, the assistant city attorney, says there isn't any evidence of improper political influence in all this. &quot;But is the appearance bad? Yes, the appearance is bad,&quot; he concedes.    Nor are appearances helped by two memos from Channing Johnson, one of the leading minority shareholders, to a top Bradley aide. One says that &quot;appropriate political support&quot; might be needed in negotiating details of the deal with Kaufman andamp; Broad. The other memo notes that the distribution of some of the shares had to pass muster with a senior city councilman.    The Galloways insist the city simply never looked for improprieties, even though some seemed obvious candidates for review. For instance, Mr. Johnson, before becoming a minority shareholder was a city council aide who actually helped set up the south-central franchise. He then quit his city job and lobbied hard to get a piece of the franchise, despite a municipal ordinance that bars former city employees from certain types of lobbying activities.    Mr. Johnson denies any wrongdoing. The district attorney's office conducted an investigation that consisted of trying to interview Mr. Johnson and his former city council boss. When both refused to talk, the investigation was closed, according to a district attorney's report on the matter that the Galloways obtained.    Mr. Perez, the city official, says he hasn't closely examined the Johnson case, but in similar conflict-of-interest situations the city has interpreted the ordinance to apply only to a former official when he is representing another party. If he is also representing himself as a part owner, it's legal, says Mr. Perez, though he clearly isn't completely comfortable with that interpretation. &quot;It's a loophole you could drive a Mack truck through,&quot; he says.    ---@ Cable Television's Growing Reach @ As cable becomes widespread ... @ Households with basic cable available 86% @ Households taking basic cable 52% @ Households not taking basic cable 34% @ Households with no basic cable available 14% @ Users pay more for the service @ AVERAGE CABLE REVENUE @ MONTHLY PRICE FROM BASIC @ OF BASIC CABLE SERVICES @ (In dollars) (In millions of dollars) @ 1980 $7.85 $1,648.5 @ 1981 8.14 2,100.1 @ 1982 8.46 2,678.6 @ 1983 8.76 3,101.0 @ 1984 9.20 3,632.2 @ 1985 10.25 4,366.5 @ 1986 11.09 5,083.7 @ 1987 13.27 6,552.7 @ 1988 14.40 7,724.7 @ Source: Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., Cable TV Investor </TEXT></DOC>
