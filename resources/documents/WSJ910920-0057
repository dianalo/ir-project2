For $150 million, GEgot a controlling stake in Tungsram Ltd., a dimminglight-bulb maker with 7% of the European market, an assemblyline that broke one of every four bulbs and bookkeepers whodid their accounting with pencils.   It also got Karoly Vigh.</LP><TEXT>   A Tungsram employee for three decades and a Communist fortwo, Mr. Vigh was a classic product of a state-run enterprisewheezing away behind the Iron Curtain. Although he was atop-level manager, he had been discouraged from makingdecisions on his own. Compliance, not initiative, had carriedMr. Vigh up the socialist ladder. He didn't speak a syllableof English and wouldn't have understood the words and phrasesof capitalism even if he did.   GE put him to work as a technical director in thepreviously neglected environmental division. There, as washis custom, Mr. Vigh waited for instructions from the centralplanners. When none came, he went about his job in the onlyway he knew how.   &quot;I wanted to tell my boss everything I was doing and findout his opinion of everything,&quot; says Mr. Vigh, 51, speakingthrough an interpreter. &quot;What I found out is that my bossdoesn't want to know everything I'm doing. He tells me, `If Ihave to make all your decisions for you, one of us isn'tnecessary.'&quot;   As he recalls his introduction to the American way, Mr.Vigh's eyes widen with wonder, as if, after all these months,he still doesn't get it. &quot;So much freedom, so muchresponsibility,&quot; he marvels. &quot;We're not used to this.&quot;   GE's experience with Mr. Vigh -- and 18,000 othersimilarly bewildered employees -- has been a clash ofcorporate cultures unknown in American merger-and-acquisitionexperience. Multinational corporations are by now accustomedto inferior telephone systems, antiquated factories,incomprehensible bureaucracies and the occasional revolution.But in Eastern Europe, there are riddles unfathomable to eventhe most world-wise executives. For here, where bothworkplaces and work forces have been warped by 40 years ofcommunism, an acquisition involves taking over not only afailing company but a failed way of life as well.   And as GE has discovered at Tungsram, a sprawling complexof brick buildings straight out of the early days of theindustrial revolution, retooling factories is far easier thanretooling minds.   &quot;In making lamps, there's a great deal in common betweenhow it is done in the U.S. and how it is done in Hungary,&quot;says David Gadra, one of GE's American managers here. &quot;Buthow a company is run, how people are managed, arefundamentally different. The schools haven't prepared peoplehere for a demand-based economy. For 40 years they have beenliving in one economic system, and now everything theylearned is changing.&quot;   Mr. Gadra, who has been directing the technology switchfrom pencils to computers, wrestles daily with one of themost vexing puzzles confronting Western managers in EasternEurope: &quot;How,&quot; he wonders, &quot;do you communicate the importanceof 100% quality to people who have been accustomed tostanding in line and buying whatever is available at whateverquality?&quot;   After pouring $50 million of capital investment intoTungsram since its acquisition, GE has learned that moneyalone isn't the answer. Much more valuable, it has found, ispatience, and plenty of it.   Thus, every morning Mr. Gadra gathers hisinformation-systems managers to see what can be learned fromthe problems of the previous 24 hours. &quot;What I often get isan eloquent, detailed description of what went wrong and whatthe current situation is, but an absolute silence about aplan to go forward to solve it,&quot; he says. &quot;Day in and dayout, you go back to the fundamentals. You keep reinforcing,reinforcing. As in athletics, you keep raising the bar ofexpectations. Some days you go out and see you can't evenmatch yesterday. So you go back again to the fundamentals.&quot;   As GE tries to bring capitalism to light, Tungsram hasbeen turned into a corporate kindergarten. There are&quot;business made easy&quot; courses, where everyone, from janitorsto executives, learns that &quot;profit&quot; isn't a dirty word. Thereare sensitivity classes, which teach that it is all right tocriticize. There is a weekly newsletter that has replaced thehomilies of Lenin with those of Lombardi. The message &quot;Wewant to win, not just exist,&quot; constantly assaults the mindsof people who were once led to believe that just showing upfor work was achievement enough.   &quot;They are very simple things, but we need to learn them,&quot;says Erzsebet Badonfai, a 25-year-old fund manager in thefinance department. She has just completed amanagement-training course, which includes helping ablindfolded partner construct a tower with building blocks.&quot;I dared to speak and say my opinions to others,&quot; she says,amazed at herself, &quot;even if they weren't compliments.&quot;   Tungsram, which was founded in 1896, was once one of theproudest of Hungarian institutions. In the early part of thiscentury, Tungsram pioneered the use of tungsten filament, thekey element in a light bulb, and was on the cutting edge ofhigh technology of the day. Then came the Nazi invasion andan exodus of Tungsram's Jewish scientists. Many otherscientists cleared out of the country after World War II whenthe Communists took control and applied a Stalinist rigidityto commercial scientific work. In the next four decades,innovation was trampled in the manic drive to meet theproduction quotas of the central plan. New investment wasneglected, modernization ignored. Still, thanks to thequality of its bulbs and its low labor costs, Tungsrammanaged to hold about 7% of the Western European lightingmarket, generating revenues of $300 million annually for thecentral-government treasury.   It was this market share that attracted GE, which had onlya token presence in Europe. The Americans immediately set outto boost productivity in factories where the technology wasgenerally 15 years behind what GE uses in the U.S. Teams ofmanagers from Budapest and Cleveland, where GE Lighting isbased, crisscrossed the Atlantic to compare notes. One visitto Tungsram by an American production team yielded a list of112 projects to cut costs and improve efficiency. Soon, ajoint Budapest-U.S. venture will begin producing a newcompact fluorescent bulb here.   The overhaul of Tungsram's quaint record-keeping systemhasn't been so smooth. The introduction of an integrateddata-communications network, capable of linking all ofTungsram's operations locally and throughout Europe, has beendelayed for a couple of years by a Hungarian phone system onwhich calling Cleveland is often easier than calling theother side of Budapest.   By the end of the year, GE plans to have 500 individualpersonal computers on desks around Tungsram. But theiroperations remain limited as the users must learn not onlyhow to computerize the accounts but also how to do theaccounts, Western-style. And there is only so much thatcomputers can do in Hungary: For instance, they can automatethe payroll, but human hands are still needed to stuffenvelopes with cash because personal banking services arerare.   However, while most of GE's capital investment has beenspent on clearing away the mess of communism from theworkplace, much of its time has been invested on cleansingminds.   &quot;I think we've caught the worker's fancy,&quot; says GeorgeVarga, a GE veteran now in charge of Tungsram. &quot;These peoplehave really been treated like trash the past 40 years.&quot; Toremove this legacy, he doesn't so much manage; he nurtures.   If anyone should appreciate this challenge, it is Mr.Varga, who was born in Budapest and 19 years later was a lawstudent at the vortex of the anti-Communist uprising in 1956.After Soviet tanks crushed the rebellion, Mr. Varga fled tothe West, crawling under barbed wire into Austria whileevading, ironically, Tungsram-made searchlights sweeping theborder. Since 1970, when those who fled were offered ageneral amnesty, he has regularly returned to visit hisfamily.   But even Mr. Varga didn't recognize the full effect of thepost-1956 years on the country he had left behind until hepicked up the reins of Tungsram.   &quot;I was hoping that I would come home and find an exuberantnation, which I didn't find,&quot; says Mr. Varga, now 55 yearsold. &quot;The mental attitudes still disturb me. Rather thancan-do, it's a can't-do attitude. I understand the damage ofthe last 40 years, how they heard everything, all thepromises, and nothing ever works. So I can see how they say,`Well, let's wait and see.' But I would wish they would besomewhat more aggressively positive.&quot;   He even found doubters at his old family home in Budapest,where his mother spiced his homecoming meals with a heapingdose of skepticism.   &quot;Well, how are things in the company?&quot; the mother wouldask, ladling out the soup.   &quot;Things are doing fine,&quot; the son would reply.   &quot;What do you know?&quot; the mother would shoot back, lookingat her son.   Mr. Varga chuckles wearily as he recounts theconversation. &quot;We'd go through the same ceremony every time,&quot;he says. &quot;It's so characteristic of the attitude here.&quot;   Now, if his mother asks, Mr. Varga can point to someresults. Production at Tungsram has risen about 30% at thesame time the bloated work force has been reduced 30%. Whilethe restructuring costs and capital expenditures (which mustbe immediately written off under Hungarian accountingregulations) resulted in Tungsram's posting an $18 millionlocal loss last year, sales rose to about $400 million, up byabout a third since 1989, the year before GE took over.Frustration and reward are running about even, but by themeasurements of Eastern Europe, that is success.   &quot;In the back of our minds, there was always a fear ofimpending catastrophe, that we would wake up one day and seethat it's not going to work,&quot; says Mr. Gadra. &quot;But every daythe great fear of the unknown is slowly being worked away.&quot;   Even Mr. Vigh is becoming more comfortable. After a recenttrip to see the operations in Cleveland, he came back almosta new man, less bewildered, no longer afraid of the new ways.   &quot;Think of a hungry person,&quot; he says, his eyes wideningagain, &quot;who has had a feast laid before him.&quot;   ---   Mr. Thurow, a Wall Street Journal reporter based inVienna, covers Central Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
