(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Managing Computer SecurityandM;A midst a lip-service overload about PC proliferation and computer security,few empirical studies have been made of computer fraud, crime, and abuse,computer security control and audit, and the cost of security.andP;  The fewstudies that have been performed have not compared the way firms actuallymanage their computer security with the way they admit they should.andM;Recently, we surveyed the Fortune 500 firms to gain insight into the natureof various elements of computer security management.andP;  An attempt was made toinvestigate relationships between the prevailing computer security problemsand the size of a company's information systems facilities, as measured bythe number of MIS employees and the annual budget of the MIS department.andM;The surveys were mailed to computer security officers or MIS managers of allthe Fortune 500 companies.andP;  The questionnaire inquired about various aspectsof computer security.andP;  Within six weeks, 88 out of 500 surveys were returned,and 86 were deemed usable.andP;  The response rate (17.2%) appeared reasonable inlight of the sensitive nature of the topic.andM;The median number of employees in the surveyed MIS departments was found tobe approximately 150 people.andP;  The median annual MIS budget of the respondingcompanies was estimated to be approximately $20 million.andP;  More than half ofthe respondents allocate less than 0.5% of this to computer security; about athird allocate between 0.5% and 1.0%; and the remaining companies allocateover 1.0%.andM;For questions of policy direction, standards and procedures, and areas ofresponsibility, the surveyed firms usually have comprehensive guidelines inplace.andP;  More than three quarters of the firms have documented emergency,backup, and recovery plans.andP;  However, approximately one third of the firmsnever test these plans, nor do they reevaluate security programs at specifiedintervals.andM;Policies are generally formulated by consultation between the MIS manager andtop management.andP;  Before computer security policies can be adopted, finalapproval must be obtained from senior management.andP;  This involvement in bothpolicy formulation and approval can be viewed as a definite sign that topmanagement provides a high level of support to the computer security program.andM;Personnel Security WeakandM;Personnel security programs were found to be weak: companies do not generallydo a good job of checking up on employees once they have begun to performtheir duties.andP;  In particular, firms do not:andM;* use attitude surveys to monitor the level of employee morale;andM;* consider an employee's level of security consciousness during his/herperformance assessment;andM;* use job rotation as a means of evaluating an employee's security-relatedbehaviors;andM;* use the regular vacation of a key employee to perform a mini-audit of thatemployee's work; andandM;* identify employees whose particular responsibilities make them potentialsecurity risks.andM;To understand why firms have not adopted these measures, it is instructive toexamine the relationship between employees and the personnel department.andP;  Atthe pre-employment stage, background investigations and reference checks ofprospective employees are performed as a matter of course; pre-employmentagreements are signed with new employees; and new employees are formallynotified of their security responsibilities.andP;  This interaction facilitatesthe personnel security program.andP;  During the post-employment stage there isagain a substantial amount of contact between personnel officers anddeparting employees.andP;  However, during the employment stage of the employmentcycle, the survey shows that most elements of the personnel security programare neglected by the majority of firms.andM;Security training is another weak area in the personnel security program,with 52% of firms making no provision for any form of employee securitytraining.andM;Slightly more than half of the firms have developed asset-threatinventories--inventories that address what safeguards will protect theirassets against predetermined threats.andP;  The most commonly used measures thatfirms employ to rank identified threats are expected loss, frequency ofoccurrence, hours of downtime, and dollars of damage.andM;The rest of the firms neither perform any risk assessment of security threatsnor do they formally identify and evaluate their computer assets.andP;  Subjectivemethods of risk assessment are more widely employed in identifying assets andevaluating potential threats than such quantitative methods as the Delphitechnique or Threat Model (an analysis tool for identifying security threatsthat is based on cause and effect relationships).andP;  As one of the respondentscommented, &quot;Risk analysis need not be performed to know that softwaresecurity systems are required.andP;  In fact, such analysis only prove what isalready known and, thus, amount to wasted time and effort.&quot;andM;Security Officers' ViewsandM;Although there is a general congruence between how firms manage computersecurity and how their security officers feel computer security should bemanaged, some differences were reported.andP;  Particularly in the area ofpersonnel security, the respondents felt that their firms are failing in twoimportant areas: providing some form of security training for MIS employeesand identifying employees whose particular responsibilities make thempotential security risks.andM;In addition, there are a series of minor differences between the views ofsecurity officers and the firms' practices in the area of asset-threatinventory.andP;  Most of these differences relate to either the formality of theanalysis and control procedures or the importance of applying certainsecurity programs.andP;  For the most part, the firms use subjective estimatesmade by people who are familiar with the assets, while security officersprefer using estimates based on the cost created if the asset wereunavailable for a specified time period.andM;Overall, security officers feel that still more can be done to enhance thelevel of computer security within their firms, and they recommend applyingmore formal analysis and control procedures to security programs, as well asincreasing the frequency of certain security procedures.andM;The problems that have affected the largest number of firms are summarizedand shown in &quot;Problems Affecting computer Security.&quot;andP;  The costliest areutilities failures, according to 36% of the firms; compliance failure, in 33%of the firms; and improper guidance, in 21% of the firms.andP;  These findingssuggest that the often publicized threats such as computer hackers and otherwhite collar criminals have had either little or no effect on the majority offirms, or are not being reported.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
