President Bush renewed the battle on Monday with a new set offigures indicating a capital gains reduction would never reduce taxcollections.   ``We see no negative effect in any year,'' a senior TreasuryDepartment official told reporters. The new estimates are based onprojections that a larger number of taxpayers would sell assets inresponse to the lower tax rate, the official said.   The administration predicted cutting taxes on capital gains _profits from the sale of real estate, stock and other investments _would actually increase tax collections in each of the next fiveyears by a total of $12.5 billion.   Bush's somewhat different proposal last year would have raised$16 billion by Treasury estimates over the first five years, lost$20 billion over the next three and then begun producing revenueagain. Congressional analysts predicted small revenue increases inthe first two years followed by declines in each successive year.   Bush says a capital gains reduction is needed to spur investmentin job creation and make the United States more competitive withforeign countries. He also called for a new tax break to encourageindividual saving.   Under those two major revenue proposals:   _When fully effective in 1992, 30 percent of capital gains fromproperty owned three years or longer would be exempt from tax; 20percent from assets owned two years, and 10 percent from propertyowned at least one year. Most property, including real estate andtimber but not collectibles, would qualify.   _Retroactive to Jan. 1, a couple whose income is $120,000 orless could set aside up to $5,000 a year in a ``family savingsaccount'' and interest earned would be tax-exempt if the account isheld for at least seven years. Deposits of up to $2,500 a yearwould be allowed single people with income under $60,000. Thedeposits would not be tax deductible.   Democratic leaders say a capital gains cut would begin undoingthe landmark 1986 tax overhaul, which taxed gains at the same ratesthat apply to other income, and 80 percent of the benefits would goto those with incomes of $100,000 a year.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., revived thefairness argument Monday. ``At a time when President Bush wants tocut the capital gains tax for the wealthy and maintain punishinglyhigh Social Security taxes on everyone else, I question whether hispriorities are right for the times,'' he said.   The president took note of a well-publicized proposal by Sen.Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would cut Social Securitytaxes to stop the government from using surplus Social Securityrevenues to pay for other programs. Bush declined to endorse such areduction; instead, he proposed that once the federal budget isbalanced, Social Security surpluses be used to retire governmentdebt.   Bush's budget recommends $15.7 billion in tax increases, but nogeneral boost in income taxes, and a $5.6 billion increase in userand service fees.   The president proposed $1.8 billion in tax reductions inaddition to the capital gains cut, including a new credit of up to$1,000 a year for each child under age 4 in low-income families.   Among other revenue proposals, the budget would:   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long distancetelephone service, which is due to expire Dec. 31.   _Raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets to 10 percent.   _More than triple the fee on waterway shippers, to 0.125 percentof cargo value.   _Require the 3.8 million state and local government workers whoare not covered by a retirement plan to pay Social Security taxes.Also, state and local workers hired before April 1, 1986, would berequired to pay the 1.45 percent Medicare tax that most suchemployees already pay.</TEXT></DOC>
