The North also accused the South of deliberately increasingtensions after the Olympic Games.   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the ``gravemilitary provocation'' occurred in the eastern portion of the DMZat about 1:20 p.m.   ``Today they fired several pinpoint shots at our side's postfrom an artillery piece which they had carried into the DMZ bystealth,'' said the English-language report monitored in Toyko.
