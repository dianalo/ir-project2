The Act calls for the Secretaryof Commerce, with the assistance of other Federal agencies to assemble,in one location, those economic, demographic, social, and other statisticsof the United States and other countries that are of use to policymakersand analysts concerned with international economics and trade. The NTDBwill also include information of greatest interest to U.S. businesses engagedin export-related activities and to Federal and State agencies that promoteexports. The NTDB is to be operational within two years of the enactmentof the Act (i.e., August 23, 1990). <ITAG tagnum="84">Interagency Trade Data Advisory Committee </ITAG>Some of the U.S. information called for in the IEDS and the EPDS is producedby the Department of Commerce. However, a significant portion is producedby other government agencies. The Act stipulates that each agency shallprovide data considered necessary to the operation of the data bank. Inaddition, some of the data to be included in the IEDS may be derived fromforeign sources such as foreign government agencies or international organizations.The Act establishes the Interagency Trade Data Advisory Committee (ITDAC)to be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. The ITDAC will consist of:<ITAG tagnum="14">The United States Trade Representative, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of Agriculture, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of Defense, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of Commerce, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of Labor, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of Treasury, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Secretary of State, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The Chairman of the International Trade Commission, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The President of the Export-Import Bank, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">The President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">or their designees, and </ITAG>Such other members as may be appointed by the President from full-timeofficers or employees of the Federal Government. The Secretary of Commerce will seek the advice of the Committee on theestablishment, structure, contents, and operation of the NTDB as appropriatewith the goals of assuring timely and accurate collection of the informationand providing efficient access to the data by the private sector and governmentofficials. The ITDAC will be a standing committee that will provide ongoingconsultation and guidance to the Secretary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Notice by the Interagency Trade Data Advisory Committee</ITAG>This notice on the NTDB was reviewed by the Interagency Trade Data AdvisoryCommittee and the Committee was asked for its advice in correspondenceand in a formal meeting. The first draft of the notice was circulated tothe member agencies on March 17, 1989 and representatives of the memberagencies were briefed on the draft on March 20, 1989. Comments were receivedand changes made to the draft. The second draft was circulated to the memberagencies of the Committee on April 21, 1989. At the meeting of the InteragencyTrade Data Advisory Committee on May 3, 1989, representatives were briefedon the draft notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Content </ITAG>A determination has not yet been made as to the specific data entitiesto be included in the data bank. However, the language of the Act providesclear guidance on the general types of information to be included. Theagencies of the Federal government and especially those represented onthe Interagency Trade Data Advisory Committee will be asked to determinethose data entities that are prepared or estimated by them that shouldbe included in the EPDS or the IEDS. The Secretary of Commerce, with theadvice of the ITDAC, will request additional data entities if they aredetermined to be useful in carrying out the purposes of the Act or maydelete data items not determined to be useful. The resulting list of data entities, determined by the Secretary with theadvice of the Committee, will constitute the initial desired content ofthe data bank. Data entities may be added or deleted later as circumstanceschange or experience suggests improvement. The actual content of the databank when it is made available to the public will, however, be determinedin part by the resources and budget for the purpose of the NTDB that areavailable to the Secretary and to the Federal agencies supplying the data.Data determined to be useful, but not available initially, will be includedas resources and budget permit. <T3>International Economic Data System: </T3>The IEDS will contain currentand historical statistics for the United States and other countries withwhich we have ``important'' economic relations and which are determinedto be useful for policymakers and analysts concerned with internationaleconomics and trade. Among the statistics specifically cited as examplesof data to be included in the IEDS are the following: <ITAG tagnum="26">Imports and exports: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Aggregate statistics </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Industry specific statistics </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Product-specific statistics </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Market penetration statistics </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Foreign destinations for exports </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">International service transactions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">International capital markets </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Interest rates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Exchange rates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Foreign direct investment in United States </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">International labor market </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Wage rates by industry </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Unemployment rates </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Labor productivity </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Policies affecting trade </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Trade barriers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Export financing policies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Imports/exports by States </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Destination </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Origin </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">``Any other economic and trade data collected by the Federal Governmentthat the Secretary determines to be useful in carrying out the purposesof this subtitle.'' </ITAG><T3>Export Promotion Data System: </T3>The EPDS will contain informationof greatest interest to U.S. firms engaged in export-related activitiesand to Federal and State agencies that promote exports. The Act calls forthe system to ``monitor, organize, and disseminate'' information on thefollowing: <ITAG tagnum="26">Business opportunities in foreign countries </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Industry sectors in foreign countries with high export potential including:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Size of market, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Distribution of products, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Competition, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Significant applicable laws, regulations, specifications, and standards,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Appropriate government officials, trade associations and other contactpoints </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Foreign countries generally such as: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Economic conditions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Common business practices </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Significant trade barriers and tariffs, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Other significant laws and regulations regarding imports, licensing,patents, etc., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Export financing information, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Transactions involving barter and countertrade, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">``Any other similar information, that the Secretary determines tobe useful in carrying out the purposes of this subtitle.'' </ITAG>The Act specifically excludes data which are prohibited from disclosureto the public by other laws or are authorized to be withheld under provisionof law. Also, it may not contain classified information. Finally, withthe exception of section 5408 which calls for an expansion in the collectionof information on service sector transactions, the Act does not grant authorityto collect any new information from individuals or entities outside theFederal government. <ITAG tagnum="84">Users </ITAG>The Act directs Commerce to make the information available to: <ITAG tagnum="25">U.S. Government policymakers, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U.S. business firms, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U.S. workers, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U.S. industry associations, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U.S. agricultural interests, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">State and local economic development agencies; and other interestedU.S. persons who could benefit from such information. </ITAG>The Act further directs Commerce to consult regularly with representativesof the private sector and officials of State and local governments on theadequacy of trade information and seek recommendations on how the informationcan be made more accessible, understandable, and relevant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Operation and Dissemination</ITAG>The Act requires that Commerce manage the data base by utilizing appropriatedata retrieval systems to monitor, organize, analyze, and disseminate theinformation found in the data bank and to use the most effective meansto make the information available to a wide range of potential users rangingfrom individual citizens to government officials. Operation of the database should facilitate dissemination through nonprofit organizations withsignificant outreach programs.The Act further directs that information systems created by the NTDB shouldnot unnecessarily duplicate existing systems available from other U.S.Government agencies or the private sector and that Commerce provide reasonablepublic services and access (including electronic access) to any informationmaintained as part of the data base.Dissemination of the NTDB is to be facilitated through public/private partnershipswith the information community (State and local governments, nonprofitorganizations, libraries, and information vendors) to provide multipleoutlets for obtaining the information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Operation of the NTDB</ITAG>The Department of Commerce will establish, on a government computer systemor on a private computer system under contract, the National Trade DataBank. The system will be comprised of 1) all information to be containedin the Export Promotion Data System and the International Economic DataSystem, 2) computer programs and related software necessary to establish,operate, update, and maintain the information contained in the EPDS andIEDS, 3) software and related information necessary to maintain and ensurethe security of the information found in the data bank, and 4) the programsand related software necesssary to disseminate the NTDB information toits intended audience through a network of government, nonprofit, and privateinformation distributors. Management and operation of this system willbe in accord with OMB Circular A-130, Management of Information Resources,internal Department of Commerce administrative orders, and other applicableinformation processing standards that may apply as determined by the Department'sOffice of Information Resources Management.The NTDB will be operated as an information warehouse. Statistics and otherdata will be supplied by Federal Government agencies and other organizationsin bulk electronic form using magnetic tape, diskette, or telecommunicationsas the means to transfer the information from agency internal files tothe NTDB. Information in the system will be updated on a regular ongoingbasis at the same time it is made available to the public through othermeans. While the information will be stored in a Commerce-operated databank,\1\<NOTE/> supplier agencies will retain ownership and maintain controlof their respective data in the data bank. They will be solely responsiblefor updating, correcting, and verifying their data in the data bank. TheNTDB ``manager'' will not be authorized to change, correct, or delete anysubstantive data item from the data bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Some historical data may be stored off-line.The NTDB is not designed to replace existing dissemination programs ofsupplier agencies. Many individuals and organizations have already establishedmeans to obtain certain trade related information from these agencies.Access channels currently in place should not be disrupted due to the establishmentof the NTDB unless the supplier agency elects to change its disseminationprogram. The NTDB will offer an additional outlet for supplier agencies'information.In addition to the basic statistical data and reports, other informationwill be included in a data ``dictionary'' for each entity in the IEDS andEPDS. This will include such items as (examples are shown in parenthesis):program (U.S. Balance of Payments), agency/organization (BEA, U.S. Departmentof Commerce), contact (name of individual responsible for information),telephone number, update schedule (Mid-month in March, June, September,and December), creation and/or expiration date (3/3/88), time period covered(1968 to present for most series), periodicity/seasonality (Annual andquarterly, seasonally adjusted and unadjusted), basis of classification(SIC, TSUSA, etc.), description of data methods, caveats, coverage, andreferences to other sources of information. The ``data dictionary'' willbe used both for internal NTDB operations and will be disseminated in electronicand paper form so that users will be able to determine what is in the databank.To the extent possible, computer programs required by the NTDB will takeadvantage of off-the-shelf software to minimize system development costsand expected future maintenance expenditures. The system will be builtusing data management software that features a structured query language(SQL). The implementation will be designed to allow for expansion of thecontent of the data bank with a minimum of reprogramming effort.Trade-related information now available from supplier agencies is structuredin a wide variety of formats. By contrast, data for both the IEDS and theEPDS will be supplied and maintained in a limited set of standard formats.This will enable the data bank to accommodate as much of the supplied informationas possible without specialized programming, provide enough flexibilityto enable the data bank to dynamically change without major reprogrammingefforts, and, be logically coherent to users.<ITAG tagnum="84">Forms of Dissemination</ITAG>Information will be distributed to end users via government, nonprofit,and private distributors to take advantage of existing information disseminationnetworks. ``Retail'' distributors are expected to include State developmentagencies, nonprofit organizations, Federal depository libraries, the NationalTechnical Information Service, the Government Printing Office, privatesector information vendors, and Department of Commerce Field Offices.Information from the data bank will be transferred in ``bulk'' to the retaildistributors; i.e., only whole categories of information will be shipped(e.g., an update of all of BEA's international transactions), not singlerequests (e.g., exports of industrial supplies and materials excludingpetroleum in 1986). Distributors, in turn, may repackage the information,provide value-added services and/or proprietary information, and redistributethe information to their respective constituents.There will be three forms of media used to provide information. The primarymedium for distribution of NTDB information will be the compact disk-readonly memory (CD-ROM). This technology provides the capability to distributein electronic format vast amounts of information at an extremely low costrelative to other technologies (printed or electronic). Monthly NTDB CD-ROMswill be produced that contain the entire data bank,\2\<NOTE/> including all information updated during the month. Usersmay obtain the CD-ROMs individually or through a subscription service whichwill provide new CD-ROMs each month; they will be distributed by the GovernmentPrinting Office and/or the National Technical Information Service. Theywill also be distributed through the GPO Federal Depository Library program.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Some historical data may be made available on separateCD-ROMS that are updated annually or less frequently as required.The CD-ROMs will be prepared to conform with ISO-9660 standards to ensurecompatibility with existing CD-ROM readers and software. Information onthe CD-ROMs will be structured on the disk to afford maximum usabilityby a wide a variety of computer and computer operating systems. Along withthe CD-ROM, Commerce will distribute software to perform rudimentary search,reporting, and extraction functions. No specialized programs to performmore sophisticated searches or numeric manipulation are planned. Softwarewill not be written on the CD-ROM; it will be distributed using floppydiskettes containing the proper program for the computer system specifiedby the purchaser. Current plans call for software to be developed for theApple MacintoshTM and IBM PCTM (or compatible) families of computers. Programsfor other computer operating systems will be provided as demand warrantsand as CD-ROM technology is made available to these systems.Using the CD-ROM medium for distribution will not be appropriate for asmall subset of NTDB information. This constitutes information that isperishable in nature; it loses its value quickly and must be accessed assoon as possible after it is made available to the public. For example,Commerce's International Trade Administration and the Department of Agricultureissue daily trade opportunities (TOPS), which are leads to help U.S. businessesexport their goods and services to foreign countries. TOPS leads are usuallyvery time sensitive, often requiring submission of bids within 30 to 60days of the date the TOPS notice is filed. Information on the CD-ROM willbe at least 30 and possibly 60 days old by the time it is available toend users. Consequently, a second component of the NTDB distribution servicewill be an electronic bulletin board or similar computer service that willenable NTDB end users to directly access time sensitive information. Thebulletin board will not contain other, less time sensitive informationthat is normally distributed on the CD-ROM.The third form of distribution will be via magnetic tape(s), which willcontain the same information provided on the CD-ROM.These three forms of distribution_CD-ROM, bulletin board, and magnetictape_constitute what Commerce defines as the ``standard'' NTDB service.It provides all the information found in the NTDB to as wide an audienceas possible and at the lowest possible prices. The standard service isexpected to meet the needs of the average NTDB user.In addition to the standard service, Commerce will offer a higher ``premium''level of service to users that require NTDB information (perishable ornot) as soon as it is made available to the public. The distinction betweenthe premium service and the standard service is one of timeliness and cost,not content; i.e., users of the premium service will obtain the same informationcontent distributed via the standard service but will receive it in a moretimely manner. Users of the premium service will be charged the full directcost of providing this information to them which is expected to be higherthan the cost of obtaining the NTDB using the standard service. Specificpremium service costs which may be recovered through user fees are outlinedin OMB Circular A-130 and the Department of Commerce Draft DepartmentalAdministrative Order on Electronic Dissemination of Information.The premium service will provide users with direct electronic access tothe NTDB. This may be accomplished via standard asynchronous telecommunicationsor via specialized high-speed data links. The exact type of telecommunicationsservice offered will depend on the capabilities of the computer site selectedto house the NTDB operations. However, the premium service will not allowselective query and access to the data bank. Rather, it will provide amechanism to transfer updated information in bulk from the NTDB computersystem to the premium user's computer system.An example may clarify the premium service concept. One type of premiumservice user is expected to be an information vendor that will obtain NTDBinformation, add value to it, and resell the information to its clients.The initial distribution of NTDB information to this user will probablybe via magnetic tape. Thereafter, the user will establish communicationsperiodically with the NTDB computer to obtain more recent information.NTDB software will determine what information was updated since the userlast obtained data and transmit all of it to the user's computer.Depending on the time and frequency with which the user obtains information,the update could range from a few numbers or reports to millions of piecesof information.Finally, Commerce proposes a third level of NTDB service_NTDB authorizeddistributors_whereby Commerce and interested distributors enter into acontractual arrangement for distribution of the NTDB. Commerce wishes toencourage, through this service, the development of private value addedprograms and services which will make information contained in the NTDBmore useful to a wider spectrum of users. It is also intended to providea measure of quality control by providing a mechanism to insure the completeness,accuracy, timeliness, and documentation of the data made available to thepublic. In general, authorized distributors agree to meet certain standardsin return for the use of the NTDB logo and trademark and customer referralby the Department of Commerce. Any organization may become an authorizeddistributor.Specific contractual arrangements have not been developed. However, proposedrules specify that authorized distributors will:Make the entire NTDB available to all requestors, not just the most profitablesegments of the data bank.Update their copy of the data bank daily using the NTDB premium serviceor at a frequency commensurate with the distributor's form of dissemination,e.g., a distributor packaging NTDB information and using a CD-ROM as thedistribution medium must obtain the most recent information prior to masteringthe disc.Clearly identify the source of each data item they distribute.Pass along standard descriptive information about the data including anycaveats about use of the data.Pay an annual fee to the Department of Commerce to defray its costs ofadministering the service.Provide a feedback mechanism to enable Commerce to learn of errors in theinformation, suggestions for improvement to the content or organizationof the NTDB, usage of the information, etc.No restrictions are placed on how the information is organized, the mediumused to distribute it, or what, if any, ancillary value added servicesaccompany the information. No restrictions will be placed on charges tousers of these services; they will be expected to vary depending on theextent of specialized services accompanying the information.In return, the Department will:Conduct a modest news release and publicity campaign about the NTDB thatemphasizes the contents of the data bank and includes phrases such as ``Seeyour authorized NTDB distributor.''Provide a list of authorized distributors to the public.Provide an ``NTDB assistance phone line''. Staff will provide basic informationon the data bank and offer to send a list of distributors. A list of callersexpressing a wish to be contacted by distributors will be provided to authorizeddistributors.It is important to emphasize that redistribution of information in theNTDB is not restricted to authorized distributors. Commerce cannot norwill it attempt to prevent users of the standard or premium services fromredistributing the non-copyrighted information in any manner they see fit.However, the authorized distributor service is planned to provide qualitycontrol and provide attractive market opportunities to a large number ofinformation distributors.With very few exceptions, none of the information in the NTDB is copyrighted.If copyrighted information is included in the data bank, special permissionto redistribute it may need to the obtained from the copyright holder.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of User Access Options</ITAG>The three levels of service proposed provide users of the NTDB with a numberof choices for receiving information. In sum, the standard service offersaccess to all data the lowest possible prices; the premium service offersaccess with more frequent updates and faster delivery at higher but stillreasonable prices; the authorized distributor service offers the prospectthat non-Federal sources will provide value added services and analysisat commensurate rates.<ITAG tagnum="84">Developer's Toolkit</ITAG>The Department of Commerce wishes to encourage the development of ancillarycomputer programs, analytical tools, and other related data by non-Federalsources to assure the widest and most effective use of information foundin the National Trade Data Bank. To meet this objective, the Departmentwill prepare and issue to all interested parties a Developer's Toolkitwhich will provide sufficient information about the content and structureof the NTDB to enable businesses and individuals to design and preparethese tools. Information to be included in the toolkit will include:<ITAG tagnum="24">File structure and organization of the CD-ROM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">File structure and organization of the distribution tape</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">File structure and organization of information distributed online</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">The data dictionary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Data bank update schedule</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Suggested applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">Sample data files</ITAG>Tentative plans call for the Developer's Toolkit to be available by December31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Resource and Budget Constraints</ITAG>The Department of Commerce supports the NTDB is doing everything possible,within the tight limits of the Department's budget, to get the system intooperation by the August 1990 date set by the Trade Act. The NTDB is anadvanced and complex information distribution system requiring time andsubstantial development and data conversion costs to the Department ofCommerce and the other Federal Agencies supplying data. Nothing in thisnotice should be construed to guarantee that the NTDB will be completewith all described features in August 1990. The NTDB is expected to evolveand improve after its initial release; features described in this noticebut not initially available will be added as resource and budget availabilitypermit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>The Department of Commerce invites the public to comment on the proposedpreliminary implementation plan within 30 days of this notice. In particular,the Department of Commerce solicits views by the public on:1. The proposal to have three levels of service_standard, premium, andauthorized distributor service.2. The proposed rules for the authorized distributor service.3. The specific contents of the international economic data system andthe export promotion data system.4. Specific telecommunications requirements for access to the premium service.Recommendations received may be incorporated into planning for the contentand organization of the data bank. At its option, the Department of Commercemay elect to distribute recommendations (without attribution) as part ofthe NTDB Developer's Toolkit in order to provide further guidance to softwarewriters designing programs to enhance the value of information in the NTDB.Additional <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices about the National Trade Data Bank maybe issued as plans are further developed covering the content of the databank, the authorized distributors service, and proposed user charges. Personsinterested in receiving these and other public correspondence concerningthe NTDB directly may have their name added to the NTDB mailing list bycontacting John E. Cremeans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Mark W.
