For many Third World nations, troubled by fragile economies andsubstandard agricultural sectors, the greenhouse effect's globalwarming will have grave consequences, environmental experts warnedhere recently at an international conference on the greenhouseeffect.   While industrialized countries have the scientific potential tofind technological solutions to the problem and the money to payfor them, most developing nations are unable to cope with it.   ``Unfortunately, they do not have the means,'' said Celso Roque,head of the Philippine delegation to the 68-nation conference.   Some experts believe global warming, which amounted to a1.5-degree (Fahrenheit) rise in the average worldwide temperatureover the past century, is caused mainly by the carbon dioxideemissions from power plants, factories and cars in theindustrialized world.   At the Noordwijk conference, delegates adopted a resolutioncalling for stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions ``as soon aspossible.''   But the two largest industrialized nations, the United Statesand Japan, refused to commit themselves to the year 2000 as thedate by which stabilization should be implemented.   Many scientists predict that if the emissions _ and those ofother gases associated with the greenhouse effect _ continue, thepace of global warming could increase four to sevenfold in the nextcentury.   ``I predict the Third World will be hardest hit by such a risein temperatures,'' said the American environmentalist Dan Becker ofthe Washington-based Sierra Club.   ``Think of their current unstable food situation _ it can onlyget worse as their agricultural sectors collapse underenvironmental pressure,'' Becker told a reporter outside theconference room.   Many experts, among them Kenya's Othieno, believe the greenhouseeffect will ultimately lead to a vast increase in desert areas.   Some experts also predict that low-lying coastal and deltanations such as Bangladesh could be inundated as the sea levelrises as a result of the melting polar ice caps.   ``We may suppose that the absence of rains, and theunpredictable character of the weather in general, are initialsigns of the greenhouse effect,'' said Othieno, a staff member of aNairobi-based environmentalist group called Energy and EnvironmentOrganization.   Roque of the Philippines painted a gloomy picture of a ThirdWorld hit by droughts precipitated by the greenhouse effect.   ``Crop lands will turn into deserts, there will be more forestfires. ... Hydroelectric dams and irrigation systems will berendered useless,'' Roque told delegates.   Continued global warming could result in an ominous change inthe oceans, he said. ``Ocean currents will be modified withunpredictable consequences for world fisheries.''   Many conference officials from developing nations said theindustrialized world, where 65 percent of all greenhouse-relatedemissions originate, should take the lead in reversing the trend.   ``The incessant large-scale burning of non-renewable fossilfuels in the North is ecologically disgraceful,'' Roque said.   Delegates here also agreed to set up a fund to help developingnations cope not only with the consequences of climate change, butalso with one of its major causes _ destruction of tropical rainforests.   ``We must protect the scant natural resources we have in theThird World,'' Othieno said.   That involves more than just conservation, for there are alsopressing social and economic dimensions, Roque noted.   ``Population growth drives the impoverished landless peasantsinto forest lands, where they slash and burn the forests to eke outa living,'' he said.   ``The pressure to generate foreign exchange for the heavy debtpayments and the political necessity of providing employmentjustify commercial logging.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs, Nov. 16</NOTE></DOC>
