The accusation was made in a clandestine television broadcast byAdela de Giroldi, the wife of Maj. Moises Giroldi.   The broadcast was transmitted for 25 minutes on channel 12, achannel unused by any of the five television stations in Panama.   Sunday morning various radio broadcasts were interrupted byclandestine signals telling listeners to watch channel 12.   Mrs. Giroldi fled to Miami as did some relatives of other rebels.   ``I feel proud of my husband and that he died with honor,'' Mrs.Giroldi said.   ``They lined up my husband and the others to kill them in coldblood because they surrendered, and without any thought they weremurdered. To those they don't like, death. To those they like,death. And to those they don't understand, death.''   ``Gen. Noriega is capable of any madness, of anything,'' shesaid.   Twenty-seven officers were arrested after the Oct. 3 revoltagainst Noriega, who controls the government as the head ofPanama's Defense Forces. Eight rebel soldiers were killed whenNoriega loyalists crushed the attempted coup.   The government has denied earlier reports that some of therebels officers were executed after surrendering.   Mrs. Giroldi said of Noriega, ``He is not in a condition to runthe country or the Defense Forces. There are still good and honestofficers who could command the Defense Forces well.''   She said Noriega is ``not fighting for nationalism, he'sfighting for his own territory, his survival.''   Noriega has shuffled leadership posts in the Defense Forces.Some officers close to him were involved in the uprising. Noriegahas accused the United States of trying to infiltrate the military,encouraging young officers to overthrow the general.   Washington has been putting pressure on Noriega to resign sincehe was indicted on drug charges last year by two grand juries inFlorida. Noriega has said the accusations are false and were madeby the United States as an excuse to abrogate the Panama CanalTreaties. The treaties turn control of the waterway over to Panamabefore the end of the century.   There was no indication where the signal on channel 12 came fromor who was responsibile. The government did not comment on thebroadcast.   Kurt Frederick Muse, a 39-year-old U.S. citizen, was arrested inApril and accused of making clandestine broadcasts. Panama accusedthe U.S. government of giving Muse the equipment necessary for theoperation.   It was not known if Muse is still in custody.</TEXT></DOC>
