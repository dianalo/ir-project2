Relevant publications were identifiedthrough detailed searches of national and international electronic databasesand through our personal knowledge of the subject. Publications werenumbered and key worded, and referenced in an electronic data-retrievalsystem that permits quick access through computerized searches on publicationnumber, authors, key words, title, year, and journal name. Photocopiesof all publications contained in the database are maintained in a filethat is numerically arranged by citation number. This report of the databaseis provided as a useful reference and overview. It should be emphasizedthat the database will grow as new citations are added to it. With thatin mind, we arranged this report in order of ascending citation numberso that follow-up reports will simply extend this document. The databasecite 1212 publications. Publications are from 119 different scientificjournals, 27 of these journals are cited at least 5 times. It also containsreference to 42 books and published symposia, and 129 reports. Informationrelevant to radiation biological dosimetry and risk assessment is widelydistributed among the scientific literature, although a few journalsclearly dominate. The four journals publishing the largest number ofrelevant papers are Health Physics, Mutation Research, Radiation Research,and International Journal of Radiation Biology. Publications in HealthPhysics make up almost 10% of the current database.</TEXT></DOC>
