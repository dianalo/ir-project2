At least 600 people climbed on top of their homes to escape thesurging waters of the River Gumti, which tore a 100-foot-wide holein the embankment at Debidar village on Saturday, officials at theFlood Forecasting Center said.   The river, fed by incessant rains and a swollen Brahmaputra Riverthat feeds it, flooded Debidar and nine other villages in Comilladistrict, 55 miles east of Dhaka, said an official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   He said more than 500 people had fled their homes in panic andtaken shelter in a school.   Rescue workers were trying to close the breach and remove themarooned people from the roofs, he said.   The Flood Forecasting Center said other tributaries of theBrahmaputra and Ganges, which crisscross Bangladesh, were steadilyrising. At least 10 areas in northern and eastern Bangladesh werelikely to be inundated by Monday if the rivers continued to rise,the center said.   The two rivers originate in neigboring India. The Brahmaputrapasses through the eastern Indian state of Assam before flowingthrough Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal.   Officials in Bangladesh said the flood destroyed about 15,000acres of paddy, the main food crop of the impoverished nation.   Bangladesh, a low lying delta of 110 million people, alternatesbetween floods and drought. Two months ago, a drought destroyedalmost half the 5 million tons of paddy that was ready for harvest.   Last year, three fourths of the country was inundated duringfloods that killed at least 1,400 people and left 2.3 millionhomeless.</TEXT></DOC>
