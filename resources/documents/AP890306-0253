Meanwhile, worried commuters nationwide breathed sighs of reliefafter a federal judge blocked sympathy walkouts by railroad workersand striking Eastern Machinists called off plans to picket about adozen commuter rail stations.   The Eastern strike began Saturday with a walkout by 8,500mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew over demands for wageconcessions. Most of Eastern's pilots and flight attendants havehonored picket lines, virtually shutting down the carrier.   Only about 9 percent of Eastern's 1,000 daily flights took offSunday, according to Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.   The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of Eastern'susual 100,000 daily passengers at airports nationwide and have leftother airlines scrambling to accommodate those travelers.   Pan American World Airways said its already-busy shuttle doubledits normal rush hour schedule from Washington, New York and Bostontoday.   The shuttle, which usually flies once an hour from each city,planned to fly every half hour today, except for the slow hoursbetween 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.   She said Pan Am also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planesfor 150-seat Boeing 727s on some flights between New York and Boston.   The airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000passengers on the shuttle over the weekend, also with a doubledschedule. It expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekdaynorm, Hanlon said.   Eastern's sister company, Houston-based Continental Airlines,which is also owned by Texas Air Corp., has ``added some extrasections to already existing flights where there has been marketdemand, primarily Newark. N.J., to Florida,'' according to spokesmanArt Kent.   Kent said that pickets have not gone up against Continental andthat the strike was not having any effect on its operations.   In Dallas, Greyhound Lines Inc. said extra buses were standing byat several East Coast cities today prepared for heavier-than-usualtraffic.   Greyhound said it added 200 buses and 32 express routesconnecting New York, Boston, Providence, R.I., Washington, andPhiladelphia in anticipation of a heavier demand for bus travel.   ``We're not like airlines. We don't sell out of seats,'' saidspokeswoman Elizabeth Hale. ``We just keep adding buses and sendingthem out.''   Hale said Greyhound ``should be able to maintain on-timeexpectations, ... now that the commuter rails are open.''   On Sunday, U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson signed atemporary restraining order in New York blocking rail workers fromsympathy strikes to support striking Eastern employees.   The machinists had planned to mount secondary picket lines atcommuter railroads today and rail union leaders had said they wouldhonor them.   The machinists promised to file an emergency appeal today.   Patterson's order will last until 3 p.m. Wednesday, when he willconduct a hearing to determine if he should issue a temporaryinjunction.</TEXT></DOC>
