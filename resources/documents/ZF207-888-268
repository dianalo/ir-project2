Anderson credits her success as manager of the Ada 9X Project toher organizational skills and strong professional network.andM;&quot;I define precisely what I want and pick the very best people.andP;  I trust theirjudgment to determine how the job will get done,&quot; said Anderson, who has beenchief of the Computer Technology Section at the Air Force Base, Fla., since1982.andP;  She was appointed Ada 9X project manager in 1988.andM;As section chief, Anderson is responsible for developing software andhardware for the Air Force's conventional munitions.andP;  She played a major rolein Common Ada Missile Packages (CAMP), the Defense Department's first projectdemonstrating Ada software reusability.andM;CAMP has 450 software components for tactical missile systems.andP;  Because someof the code is generally applicable, NASA and the Federal AviationAdministration are considering its use, she said.andM;The Ada 9X Project, which is revising the Ada military standard, requires agreat deal of national and international coordination.andP;  Besides overseeingrevisions, Anderson must work for approvals from the American NationalStandards Institute, DOD, the International Standards Organization and theNational Institute of Standards and Technology.andP;  The project, begun inOctober 1983, is scheduled to be complete by April 1993.andM;&quot;I work 100 percent on one project and 50 percent more on others,&quot; Andersonsaid, admitting she is a workaholic who puts in nights and weekends.andM;Anderson speaks to groups about twice a month on the project's progress.andP;  Sheattended SigAda in Canada last August and Ada Europe in Madrid last June.andM;&quot;I do a lot of reading and writing on airplanes,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;I try to keepmy priorities.andP;  It's always a balancing act.andP;  My only marching order was toget the language revised.andP;  I sculpted the entire architecture of theproject.&quot;andM;Because Anderson has no extra staff to carry out the revision, sheestablished several support groups, including a government advisory group of22 senior managers from civilian and military agencies and a 30-member teamof technical reviewers from the United States, France, Germany and Sweden.andO;They communicate over Arpanet.andM;&quot;I've been around a long time and have credibility, so it was easy toidentify the people I wanted,&quot; Anderson said.andP;  &quot;It's gratifying to see somany government people united on a common goal.andP;  It's the best thing I couldhave done.andP;  I need that networking support.&quot;andM;In a commitment to openness, she submits quarterly progress reports and hasset up a toll-free electronic bulletin board in the United States withannouncements and revision requests.andM;&quot;The biggest obstacle to software reuse is a lack of software components,&quot;Anderson said.andP;  &quot;If government helps fund the start-up cost, corporationswill develop more software.andP;  It's very important to keep the multistandardstatus of Ada.andP;  That is a benefit in tool development and will increase usageworldwide.&quot;andM;Anderson said her election to the board of directors of the AmericanInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) marks the first time aperson with a computer background was elected.andM;Anderson is senior editor of an AIAA Progress Series Book on aerospacesoftware engineering, to be published next spring.andP;  She said she hopes to setup an AIAA-sponsored scholarship in software engineering with the bookproceeds.andM;In 1988 Anderson won the Air Force Systems Command Technical QuarterlyAchievement Award and was the Air Force Armament Division General Manager ofthe Quarter.andP;  In 1987 she was chosen Engineer of the Year.andM;Anderson BEgan her DOD career in 1969 as a mathematician at the NavalOceanographic Office in Suitland, Md.andM;She spent three years as a computer scientist with System Development Corp.andO;at the Air Force Space Defense Center in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., beforereturning to government in 1973 as a mathematician at the Air Force AvionicsLaboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
