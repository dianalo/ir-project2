The ratings concern cited the city's improved financial outlook and a more manageable debt burden. Ratings on Chicago's general obligation bonds were lowered to triple-B-plus in 1983 because of the city's weakened financial condition. Sandamp;P said the city has improved its position through the reduction and projected elimination of an unreserved fund balance deficit, cost cutting and increased revenue. Ronald D. Picur, Chicago comptroller, said this was the first bond upgrade for the city since 1963.    ---   DIAMOND-BATHURST INC. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating of the company's subordinated notes due 1995 to single-B-2 from Ba-2. Diamond-Bathurst, based in Malvern, Pa., makes glass containers. Moody's said it lowered the rating because of &quot;heightened competition from better-positioned participants in the mature glass container segment of the container and packaging industry.&quot; About $80 million of debt is affected. Moody's said Diamond-Bathurst should benefit from increased production, upgraded quality control and plant closings. However, Moody's said it doesn't expect profit margins and asset returns to improve over the next three to five years. Moreover, the ratings concern said Diamond-Bathurst's narrow product line limits its involvement in more value-added forms of packaging, such as plastics. Officials of Diamond-Bathurst weren't available to comment.    ---   LEASEWAY TRANSPORTATION CORP. -- Sandamp;P lowered its rating on this Cleveland-based trucking company's senior debt to single-B-plus from single-A, affecting about $50 million in collateral trust notes. Sandamp;P withdrew its A-1 rating on Leaseway Finance Corp.'s commercial paper since the program is being discontinued. Sandamp;P removed both issues from CreditWatch, where they were placed Nov. 17 following a leveraged buyout offer from an investment group organized by Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. and senior managment. Leaseway expects to complete the buyout this month. The rating concern also assigned a single-B-minus rating to a proposed issue of $192.5 million of subordinated notes, due 2002. Moody's said the leveraged buyout offer will cause &quot;significant deterioration in the firm's balance sheet.&quot; Leaseway said it considered the ratings fair. </TEXT></DOC>
