 There are documents initially created by the Comptroller ofthe Currency, Administrator of National Banks, and then adopted by theFederal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).andM;The FFIEC consists of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, NationalCredit Union Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of theCurrency.andP;  The FFIEC provides regulatory review of a majority of thefinancial institutions in the US.andP;  Many state bank regulators have alsoadopted these regulations as the basis for their examinations.andM;Banking Circular 226: End-User Computing.andP;  This document, designated BC-226and published on January 25, 1988, describes the risks associated withend-user computing operations and stresses the need for sound controlpractices for information-processing activities in decentralizeddata-processing environments.andM;The circular acknowledges that microcomputers have in recent years becomemore prominent in business environments, where they are used not just as wordprocessors or intelligent terminals but as &quot;powerful stand-alone&quot; computers.andO;Information processing has evolved, then, well beyond the traditional centralenvironment to encompass distributed or decentralized operations.andP;  Theregulation recognizes the benefits of decentralized data processing, butstates the need to implement control procedures previously limited to centraloperations.andM;The concern of the regulators is that the deployment of newinformation-delivery and processing networks has outpaced the implementationof controls for these systems.andP;  As a result, the risks that have beenaddressed on mainframe systems have not been addressed on decentralizedsystems.andP;  Some of the risks identified in the publication are:andM;* incorrect management decisions;andM;* improper disclosure of information;andM;* fraud;andM;* financial loss;andM;* competitive disadvantage;andM;* legal or regulatory problems.andM;The circular encourages management to evaluate the risks associated with itsend-user computing networks and other forms of distributed computeroperations and to incorporate into the overall corporate information-securitypolicy those control practices and responsibilities that address thefollowing subjects:andM;* management controls;andM;* data security;andM;* documentation;andM;* data/file storage and backup;andM;* systems and data integrity;andM;* contingency plans;andM;* training.andM;The circular also requires that responsibilities for the acquisition,implementation, and support of such end-user networks and systems be clearlydefined.andP;  The circular states: &quot;It is the responsibility of the Board ofDirectors to ensure that appropriate corporate policies, which identifymanagement responsibilities and control practices for all areas ofinformation-processing activities, has been established.&quot;andM;Banking Circular 229: Information Security.andP;  Published May 31, 1988, BC-229alerts the management of national banks to the importance of informationsecurity.andP;  It addresses the need to protect all types of information,particularly that which is produced, stored, and transmitted by computer.andM;The circular recognizes that most bank information is created by or directlylinked to computer processing.andP;  It further recognizes that information,regardless of its source, can be a valuable asset to the bank and thataccuracy and confidentiality are essential to the business.andP;  Information mustbe protected, the circular states, from abuses such as inadvertent orintentional misuse, disclosure, fraud, and error, and that informationsystems, including both the data and the software that creates and stores thedata, must be secure.andP;  The circular characterizes the volume of informationand method of its transmission, and recognizes that the information isaccessible by many users, both internal and external.andM;BC-229 goes on to declare that controls must exist to minimize thevulnerability of all information and to provide necessary security.andP;  Of thevarious processes available to strengthen information security, &quot;the mostbasic are sound management policies for internal control&quot;.andP;  The circularlists the following as objectives of security controls:andM;* to ensure the integrity and accuracy of management information systems;andM;* to prevent unauthorized alteration during data creation, transfer, andstorage;andM;* to maintain confidentiality;andM;* to restrict physical access;andM;* to authenticate user access;andM;* to verify accuracy of processing during input and output;andM;* to maintain backup and recovery capabilities;andM;* to provide environmental protection against information damage ordestruction.andM;The circular states that computer hardware and software technologies can helpprotect information resources and that security features usually areavailable at each level of computer sophistication.andP;  &quot;Regardless of thecontrols adopted&quot;, the document states, &quot;they should apply to informationproduced and stored by both automated and manual methods&quot;.andM;The policy of the circular is presented in this language: &quot;The Board ofDirectors should require that information security policies exist throughoutthe bank corporation.andP;  These policies must be in writing and communicated toall personnel and other authorized users of bank information systems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
