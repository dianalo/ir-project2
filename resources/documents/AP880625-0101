U.S. District Judge William L. Standish on Friday said he foundno clear proof that the Association of Flight Attendants encouragedthe boycott, which stranded 11,000 passengers during the MemorialDay weekend. He denied the airline's request for a preliminaryinjunction, for lack of firm evidence against the union.   Still, Standish said, he has a ``strong suspicion'' of unioninvolvement. If the job action continues, he said, he would grant arequest for an immediate hearing to reconsider his decision.   The airline said it lost an estimated $1.1 million as a resultof having to cancel 179 flights because of inadequate staffingduring the three-day holiday.   ``We are pleased that the court put the Association of FlightAttendants on notice,'' said airline spokesman David Shipley. ``Asa result, we expect no future scheduled disruptions.''   Under their union contract, flight attendants can be ordered tofly only 85 hours per month. Attendants can turn down assignmentsafter they have reached 85 hours in a month. USAir relies onattendants to volunteer for overtime to keep planes in the air onthe waning days of each month.   Dee Maki, chief union representative for the Pittsburgh-basedflight attendants group, said she has ``no idea'' if the protestwill end.   But she said only some of the attendants who refused to workduring the Memorial Day holiday were protesting stalled labornegotiations. Many simply wanted the holiday off, she said.   Ms. Maki said flight attendants were elated at the judge'sdecision. ``They can't believe USAir filed the lawsuit,'' she said.   She noted that the Independence Day holiday weekend occurs atthe beginning of the month so flight attendants will not be workingon overtime and therefore cannot turn down assignments.   USAir brought the suit last week amid stalled contractnegotiations with the 1,000 flight attendants of Pacific SouthwestAirlines, which merged with USAir in April.   Federal law forbids airline workers to launch job actions orstrikes before mediation and arbitration procedures are exhausted.</TEXT></DOC>
