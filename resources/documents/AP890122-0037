Thornburgh said the ``beefed-up'' federal role would include newtask forces established specifically to focus on ``fraud and insiderdealing in both the securities and commodities markets.''   Thornburgh, interviewed on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,''declined to be specific about a current investigation of the world'stwo largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and theChicago Mercantile Exchange. But he indicated authorities werepreparing to submit evidence to a grand jury.   ``Obviously, I can't discuss in detail what's a pendinginvestigation,'' Thornburgh said. ``I don't want to, obviously, makeany predictions. But the investigation is far-reaching, it issignificant. ... We will be gathering and submitting evidence to seeif violations of the federal criminal laws have occurred.''   Asked when such a review might take place, Thornburgh said: ``Youcan never put a timetable on that, I'm afraid.''   The FBI reportedly has been investigating alleged fraud bytraders at the Chicago exchanges for the past two years. Theinvestigation centers on allegations investors were cheated out ofmillions of dollars and reportedly has included the use of wiretapsto record conversations with traders suspected of fraud.   While avoiding specifics about the Chicago case, Thornburghpromised an expanded federal role in such investigations.   ``We'll be announcing soon a much beefed-up operation in thisregard because it's basically a pro-consumer initiative,''Thornburgh said. ``People who trade on these markets are entitled totheir integrity.''   He was not specific about the composition or duties of theplanned task forces or about when the announcement of theirestablishment would be made.   Word of the Chicago investigation surfaced the same week that thefederal prosecutor widely associated with insider-tradinginvestigations on Wall Street, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani,announced he was resigning.   President Bush will appoint a successor. New York Republican Sen.Alfonse M. D'Amato has recommended criminal defense attorney OttoObermaier, despite objections from Giuliani. Presidentstraditionally accept the recommendation of the senior state senatorfrom their party.   Giuliani's objections stem from Obermaier's representation ofseveral firms that are or have been targets of insider-tradinginvestigations.   ``Those are choices that are made by the president and they wouldbe made only after careful scrutiny of the individual'squalifications to serve and carry out the president's agenda,''Thornburgh said when asked whether Bush would accept D'Amato'srecommendation.</TEXT></DOC>
