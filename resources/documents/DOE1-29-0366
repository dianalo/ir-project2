Apreliminary report is given on a study of 14 of these sites from whichdetectors have already been processed. Using nuclear track detectorsreturned after having been placed in the soil, water, external and internalair of each site for four seasons, the results yielded a high level of388 Bq/m{sup 3} (interior air) in one earthwall house. When comparedto the lowest level of 19 Bq/m{sup 3} measured in this study in standardabove-ground cavity-brick-wall house, a 20-fold increase in alpha radiationactivity is apparent. The average activity in lithotecture was foundto be 91 Bq/m{sup 3} which is approximately 30% higher than that of terratecture.Responses on medical history in relation to lung cancer, period of occupancyand smoking habits were sought. At this stage, results are inconclusiveand no correlations have been established. 15 references.</TEXT></DOC>
