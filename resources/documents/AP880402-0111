REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The daring prison escape of theleader of the August coup attempt raised new doubts about militaryleadership under President Corazon Aquino's government.   The flight Saturday of former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan, with 14 prison guards from an elite navy unit, came fourdays after the military boasted of the arrest of seven topcommunist rebels.   ``How was it possible, because he was on a ship and underguard?'' Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said of the escape. ``How could ithappen?''   Honasan, 39, served as security chief when Enrile, now anopposition leader, was minister of defense.   Before dawn Saturday, Honasan fled the prison ship where he hadbeen held since his capture in December. The 14 officers from thenavy's special warfare unit were supposed to be guarding him, butthey fled with him.   Honasan and the guards escaped under gunfire from other guardsand reached shore in two rubber dinghies a few hundred yards fromnavy headquarters.   In what may be worse for the military's image, spokesman Col.Oscar Florendo acknowledged the armed forces learned last week of apossible escape attempt and had doubled the guard force on theship. The dinghies had come with the increased security.   Mrs. Aquino announced Saturday that the vessel's commander, Lt.Cmdr. Fred Tuvilla, had been arrested and may face court-martialfor negligence.   She also threatened to punish any soldiers who help Honasan. Heand other military dissidents were responsible for six major coupplots against her government.   Florendo said Honasan was apt to try to organize new plotsagainst the government and to divide the 160,000-member military.The charismatic former colonel remains widely admired in themilitary even though he was dismissed after his Aug. 28 coupattempt left at least 53 people dead.   His escape was widely reported Saturday in the Filipino media,which normally curtail operations on Easter weekend. Scores ofcallers to Manila radio stations questioned how Honasan could haveescaped without the help of the guards.   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa told reportersSaturday he accepted responsibility for the escape but would letMrs. Aquino decide whether he should be relieved.   ``Somehow, in one way or another, I bear responsibility forensuring that our detainees are secured and procedures arefollowed,'' he said.   Last month, the congressional Commission on Appointmentsapproved de Villa's nomination as chief of staff.   The move came despite opposition from some congressmen who feltthe former Constabulary commander should have retired instead.Critics said extending his tour of duty limited promotion ofyounger officers and smacked of practices under ousted PresidentFerdinand Marcos.   The escape also raised doubts whether the congressionalcommission would approve the recent nomination of Adm. CarlitoCunanan, former chief of the Coast Guard, as navy commander.   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthey already had misgivings about Cunanan because of the CoastGuard's inept handling of rescue efforts in a December collision ofa Filipino passenger ship and oil tanker that killed 3,000 people.   The escape took place as the military was enjoying new prestigefor Tuesday's arrest of seven leading communists, including RomuloKintanar, commander of the rebel New People's Army.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos had said the arrests showed thatthe military had overcome past divisions and could now acteffectively.   But on Saturday, he called the escape ``disturbing news.''   De Villa said the search for Honasan, moreover, would divertmilitary resources from the fight against the rebels.   One Filipino politician also worried about the internationalimpact of Honasan's escape. Sen. John Osmena said it was bound totarnish the government's image abroad and raise more doubts aboutthe stability of the Aquino administration.</TEXT></DOC>
