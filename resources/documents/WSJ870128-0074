SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   The Ivan Boesky case intrudes like an unwelcome guest on the courtship ritual between this year's graduating M.B.A.s and recruiters from Wall Street. But not enough to cast a pall on the event.    Despite the notoriety of the Boesky and Dennis Levine insider-trading cases, recruiting at business schools this year is business as usual. Investment bankers say they plan to hire as many graduates from the top business schools as they did in 1986, if not more. And students are eager to accept their offers.    &quot;I don't know of one single student who because of the scandal has decided not to go&quot; into investment banking, says Sally Lannin, acting director of the M.B.A. career center at Stanford University.    If anything, students seem to regard the Boesky affair as an aberration. And that attitude worries some business educators. Although the current scandals seem to provide vivid enough examples of the consequences of excess and unethical behavior, it is unclear what lessons -- if any -- business students have learned.    &quot;The belief that the current scandal represents a few bad apples ignores the seductive culture of wealth and power that feeds ever-rising expectations,&quot; says Kirk O. Hanson, a professor at Stanford who teaches business ethics. &quot;The challenge that every M.B.A. faces is how to balance that drive for money and power with the drives to be a family person and to serve the community.&quot;    Achieving that balance may be difficult. While 87% of students in a recent survey at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business said they believe insider-trading is common in the industry, more than half still hoped to pursue a career in finance.    &quot;Our students are concerned but not to the extent that they'd want to go into another field,&quot; explains Gordon Soenksen, the associate dean at the school.    That's good news for the big investment banking firms. Last year, such firms won nearly a third of the graduating M.B.A.s from Harvard and Columbia and about 20% of the classes at Stanford, Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.    The median salary last year for Harvard and Stanford M.B.A.s was about $49,000, and placement directors say that could rise as high as $59,000 this year. Bonuses can double the total compensation. But the firms insist that the price is worth it. &quot;We're competing for the cream of the M.B.A. crop,&quot; Frederick Joseph, chief executive officer of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a firm now under investigation in connection with the Boesky affair, said recently. &quot;You've got to have that top slice of . . . intellectual power.&quot;    Such students certainly aren't ignorant of Wall Street's problems; placement officers say the stiff actions taken against Mr. Boesky, Mr. Levine and others have prompted students to reflect a little harder on the personal risks and pressures involved in investment banking.    &quot;My friends and I talk about it constantly,&quot; says Ann O'Connor, a 23-year-old student at the University of Chicago. &quot;People from good business schools, if they're honest with themselves, will be concerned about the scandals. I am.&quot;    That concern, however, hasn't kept Ms. O'Connor from accepting a job on Wall Street -- with the international equity group at Morgan Stanley. &quot;There are so many good and talented people on Wall Street that I refuse to write it off,&quot; she says.    Yet, while the Boesky affair hasn't caused students to shun the industry as a whole, any firms that become directly implicated in the scandal may suffer. &quot;I know that students with job opportunities are sitting back a bit and giving it a month to see what the fallout will be,&quot; says Ms. Lannin, the Stanford placement director.    The continuing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation on insider trading does appear to be slightly affecting Drexel Burnham's recruiting efforts. The SEC hasn't accused Drexel or any of its current employees of wrongdoing, but it has subpoenaed trading records and a number of its officials, including junk-bond wizard Michael Milken.    &quot;A lot of my classmates are really wary of going to Drexel,&quot; says Mark H. Rachesky, a 27-year-old student at Stanford, who abandoned a career in medicine to enter investment banking. &quot;So much of their profits depend on high-yield growth, and that depends on Milken, and nobody knows what will happen to Milken.&quot;    Mr. Milken wasn't available for comment. Drexel executives, who have consistently said they know nothing to suggest that Mr. Milken or other Drexel employees have done anything wrong, fear that publicity over the Boesky scandal has scared away some of the most desirable applicants. The publicity &quot;is screening out the people who are curious but not serious,&quot; says Paul M. Higbee, the firm's managing director who is coordinating recruiting for the corporate finance department.    Still, Drexel won't have a hard time filling its openings. Mr. Higbee estimates that he and his associates have selected 400 people to interview at 11 schools for the 25 jobs they are offering. Last year, the firm interviewed 300 people at nine schools for the same number of jobs.    Students and educators say the continued interest in Drexel and other firms stems from what Wall Street offers. Investment banking is &quot;hot now because it's perceived as the place where you can make a lot of money quickly and where young M.B.A.s can be movers and shakers,&quot; says Stanford's Prof. Hanson. &quot;This combines those age-old drives for money and power.&quot;    But some educators fear that those drives aren't sufficiently critiqued in business schools -- particularly in light of the current trading scandals. As a result, some students appear to have, at best, a confusing set of ethical standards.    In the Fuqua survey, for example, most students condemned Mr. Boesky as a crook who got carried away by greed and deserved to be punished for his misdeeds. Indeed, 67% felt that the $100 million penalty that Mr. Boesky paid to the SEC was too small.    Nevertheless, 44% of those same students said they would buy stock on a tip that a company was going to be acquired. And while 89% of the Fuqua students thought it was unethical to omit vital information from a government environmental report, they split 50-50 over whether price-fixing between competitors was wrong.    Prof. Hanson thinks ignorance or inexperience, rather than a propensity for wrongdoing, probably accounts for some such views. Many students, he says, really don't know what is or isn't ethical behavior in the business world. And, he adds ruefully, business schools &quot;have not included in our courses all the subtleties of insider trading. Maybe we should.&quot;    This past fall, Stanford added a seminar on ethics as part of its orientation program for new students. Prof. Hanson says the school hopes that the seminar will &quot;legitimize open discussions of ethics, which can try to overcome the perception that money and power are the sole motivations in the business culture.&quot;    It may take more than seminars, however. In the Fuqua survey, 61% of students said they were doubtful that business schools could teach ethical behavior. </TEXT></DOC>
