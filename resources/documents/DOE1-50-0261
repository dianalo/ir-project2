The studyrevealed that the reduced tin content dit not affect the mechanical propertiesas the reduced tin leads to formation of fine precipitates. The mechanicalproperties were also not altered drastically with the low level of ironand chromium concentrations studied. Cold work and {alpha}-annealingafter {beta}-quenching resulted in the growth and redistribution of secondphase particles. Metallographic studies showed that particle distributionwas not uniform. A TEM investigation of the alloys has also been undertakento study the details of microstructure developed during various heat-treatedconditions. It has been found that the {beta}-quenched samples exhibitthe most uniform microstructure consisting of acicular alpha phase withlath boundary enriched by solute element and fine intermetallic particleformation. The observed microstructural features together with the mechanicalproperties data have been compared with the available mechanical propertiescum microstructure of Zircaloy. (orig./IHOE).</TEXT></DOC>
