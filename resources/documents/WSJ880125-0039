Jeffrey Reiss, president of New York-based Request, said his company will go ahead with expansion plans with capital supplied by a new equity investor, E.M. Warburg Pincus andamp; Co. Mr. Reiss declined to disclose the amount of Warburg's investment, other than to say it will be &quot;several million dollars.&quot; The venture capital firm couldn't be reached for comment. Viacom declined comment.    Mr. Reiss said his company couldn't come to terms with Viacom over a merger with Viewer's Choice. Like Request, Viewer's Choice acts as a distributor of movies and other programs to cable systems equipped with technology for selling individual programs and events to subscribers on a one-time basis.    Although pay-per-view is still a relatively small business, many in the cable industry expect revenue from such programming to increase substantially over the next few years. </TEXT></DOC>
