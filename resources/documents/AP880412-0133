U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy said Monday the EnvironmentalProtection Agency violated federal law in registering strychninefor above-ground pest control.   The ruling affects 62 species and subspecies of animals that areprotected under federal law, including grizzly bears, salt marshharvest mice, Canada geese, wolves, owls, hawks, California condorsand bald and golden eagles.   ``It is the most broad-ranging opinion ever issued under theEndangered Species Act, both in the number of different animals itprotects and the fact that it protects them almost across theentire United States,'' said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer for threeenvironmental groups that filed suit.   Murphy said federal regulations require strychnine-laced baitsbe set so that only targeted animals are likly to eat the poison.   However, she noted, ``Strychnine is non-selective. It killsanything which ingests a lethal dose. Mortality can occur to both`target' and `non-target' species.''   Up to 500,000 pounds of strychnine-laced bait is used annuallyto kill pests such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, meadow miceand nuisance birds that eat farm crops, according to courtdocuments. The poison is used mainly in the West, but also in someEastern states.   Murphy said her injunction will remain in effect indefinitelyunless the EPA can demonstrate how it might allow use of the poisonand still prevent the incidental deaths of protected wildlife.   Murphy said the EPA violated the Endangered Species Act, theMigratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle ProtectionAct in registering strychnine.   The decision did not specify geographical limits for the ban,but said the poison cannot be used anywhere it would threaten anprotected wildlife. Some protected species, such as Canada geese,cover wide areas in their annual migrations.   Charles Shochey, a Justice Department lawyer who represented theEPA in the case, said Monday that he had not seen Murphy's decisionand could not comment.   The lawsuit was filed against the EPA in August 1986 by theSierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, and Friends of Animals andTheir Environment.   The American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents more than3 million farmers and ranchers, joined the case in support of theEPA.   The environmentalists said that at least 24 states reportedposioning of protected wildlife that had either eatenstrychnine-laced bait or the remains of other animals exposed tothe bait.   Documents given Murphy showed five condors, six peregrinefalcons, 15 golden eagles, 31 bald eagles and 724 other birds andmammals had died after eating the bait.   In Minnesota, there were documented reports of deaths fromstrychnine poisoning from 1978 to 1983 involving mallard ducks,snowy owls, a redtailed hawk, a gyrfalcon and a bald eagle, theenvironmental groups said.</TEXT></DOC>
