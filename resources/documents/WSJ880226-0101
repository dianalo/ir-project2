Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN WNEWS GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, parent of a deeply troubled major thrift, said one of its directors resigned abruptly because he disagreed with an order by federal regulators to trim the company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio by $2.5 billion.    The resignation is a sign of increasing tensions between Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. and its regulator, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Financial Corp. said J. Ralph Stone, 74 years old, resigned Feb. 11 as a director of the company and its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit, the nation's second-largest thrift in terms of assets.    In the SEC filing, Financial Corp. said Mr. Stone's resignation followed an order on Feb. 4 by the Bank Board that the company reduce its mortgage-backed securities portfolio by about 14% and use the proceeds to pay down its $14 billion in short-term secured loans from Wall Street firms. The portfolio was valued at $18.24 billion as of Dec. 31.    &quot;Mr. Stone disagreed with acceding to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's directive and resigned for this reason,&quot; Financial Corp. said in the SEC filing. &quot;He did not submit a letter of resignation.&quot; The company said it doesn't intend to fill Mr. Stone's posts immediately.    In an interview, Mr. Stone said, &quot;I don't need to be a puppet director for anyone, and so I resigned.&quot; Mr. Stone said that by ordering the sale of securities, the Bank Board &quot;eliminated the possibility that the company could operate at a profit in 1988.&quot;    Mr. Stone said the $2.5 billion portfolio reduction will eliminate about $30 million a year of net interest income.    Mr. Stone was named a director of Financial Corp. in 1984, when the Bank Board ousted former Chairman Charles W. Knapp and named William J. Popejoy, a veteran California thrift executive, as his successor.    Mr. Popejoy and Financial Corp. had enjoyed relatively good relations with former Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray, who had picked Mr. Popejoy to run the company.    Mr. Gray also approved Mr. Popejoy's strategy of trying to generate operating profit by boosting the size of the company's mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The strategy was criticized by some thrift executives and consultants, however, because it increased the potential losses to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. if the company had to be bailed out while interest rates were rising. Rising rates depress the value of mortgage-backed securities, which generally pay fixed interest rates.    In recent weeks, Mr. Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, and fellow Bank Board member Roger Martin, have repudiated the growth strategy by ordering the portfolio reduction. Since the Feb. 4 order, Financial Corp. has sold about $1.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities.    The sales reduce the risk to the FSLIC, but will reduce Financial Corp.'s revenue. Mr. Popejoy has said he disagrees with the Bank Board's order to reduce the portfolio. He declined to comment on whether other directors are considering resigning. </TEXT></DOC>
