Few directors can claim a track recordas successful as Lean's (a record that includes two best-director AcademyAwards for films that won a total of 28 Oscars). Fewer still can claim a bodyof work so unflaggingly intelligent and meticulously crafted.;    But the factthat most of Lean's films are available on video is a mixed blessing at best.While every one of the pictures below ranks high on the &quot;must see&quot; list oftrue film lovers, Lean's works since 1957 are so expansive, so sweeping, sograndly scaled that they achingly emphasize the main drawback of home video:We watch these films on a tiny TV set, rather than on the huge theatricalscreen for which they were intended. Can one be overwhelmed by the scope andgrandeur of Lawrence's Arabia, or by the vast landscapes of Zhivago's Russia,when seen on a 27-inch TV screen? Simply, no.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LEAN'S LEGACY MIXED BLESSING IN ITS BIG WAYSOME OF DIRECTOR'S WORK OUTGROWS SCOPE OFVCR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Apel, Mercury News video columnist, hosts KTEH-TV's science-fiction programson Sunday nights.  </MEMO><TEXT>     With this caveat, we present our fat primer of Lean films. To view thefinal five, might I suggest finding a friend with a large-screen,surround-sound TV, or perhaps writing the Camera One and Camera 3 people tosuggest a Lean retrospective or festival at their beautifully renovated TowneTheater? (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is scheduled there in June.) To see these epicsin any other way is to emaciate them and destroy their potent emotionalimpact.;     (box) &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942; Embassy). Intensely patrioticand compassionate statement about war, co-directed by itswriter-producer-star, Noel Coward.;     (box) &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945; IDK).Noel Coward's romantic comedy became a vehicle for  Rex Harrison, as a manhaunted by the ghost of his first wife, who is intent on breaking up hissecond marriage.;     (box) &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945; Paramount). Classicfive-hanky romance about two ordinary people in war-torn England who enterinto a poignant and ultimately doomed affair.;     (box) &quot;Great Expectations&quot;(1946; Paramount) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948; Discount). Two superb Dickensadaptations, both starring Alec Guinness.;     (box) &quot;Hobson's Choice&quot; (1954;HBO). Charles Laughton is brilliant in this period comedy about a domineeringfather running roughshod over his daughters' love lives.;     (box)&quot;Summertime&quot; (1955; Embassy). Another romantic idyll; Katharine Hepburn playsa spinster who falls in love in Venice.;     (box) &quot;The Bridge on the RiverKwai&quot; (1957; RCA/Columbia). British POWs are forced into slave labor in Burmato build a railroad trestle vital to Japanese supply lines in thisunforgettable epic of courage and obsession, which won many Oscars, includingbest picture, director and actor (Alec Guinness).;     (box) &quot;Lawrence ofArabia&quot; (1962; RCA/Columbia). Lean turned the fascinating saga of enigmaticEnglish soldier T.E. Lawrence into an archetypal epic: intelligent, grandiose,breathtaking and spellbinding. Oscars for best picture, direction, photographyand music. A must for the big-screen treatment; do not attempt to watch thison video.;     (box) &quot;Dr. Zhivago&quot; (1965; MGM/UA).

Sprawling but overlongromantic melodrama, full of spectacular pastoral scenery of Ireland.;    (box) &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1984; RCA/Columbia; PG). Fourteen years after thecritical failure &quot;Ryan's Daughter,&quot; Lean emerged to display his mastery of themedium in this multi-leveled, lushly photographed tale of cultural clashesbetween the British and &quot;the mysterious East.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  D.
