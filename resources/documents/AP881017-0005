Polls show the left-of-center Labor Party might lose half itsArab support, partly because Labor's No. 2 man, Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin, is held responsible for the harsh crackdown on thePalestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Labor and the right-wing Likud bloc headed by Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir are running neck-to-neck and a drop in Arab supportfor Labor could hand the Nov. 1 election to Likud.   ``Are you going to vote for us?'' a shirt-sleaved Peres,surrounded by a dozen security men, asked a resident Monday duringa walking tour of Shfaram, a northern Israeli town of 26,000.   The man did not answer, and instead told Peres the town neededbetter roads. Responded Peres: ``If we get enough votes, we'll getthe Finance Ministry, and then we can do it.''   In an attempt at conviviality, Peres greeted a woman with theArabic phrase ``sabah ilher,'' but after being told he had said``good morning'' instead of the intended ``good evening,'' Peresstuck to Hebrew.   Most Shfaram residents stayed indoors or watched from theirbalconies as Peres and a few dozen party activists walked throughthe town which in 1984 gave half its votes to the Communist Party.   During a reception at the home of local Labor Party leaderKhalil Mishal, Peres was handed flowers by Mishal's daughter whowore a Hebrew sticker reading ``I'm also for Labor.''   Mishal had invited about 150 Arab notables who shook hands withPeres and provided the backdrop for brief welcoming speeches.   At a later rally, Peres urged Israeli Arabs not to ``waste''their votes on the communists or the Progressive List for Peace.Both are pro-PLO and unacceptable to Labor as coalition partners.   ``If this time, there is no peace, it will be the fault of theIsraeli Arabs. If you waste your votes, nothing is going tohappen,'' Peres told about 500 people who listened in silence andapplauded briefly and politely at the end.   About 330,000 of Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens are eligible tovote this year, and could control 14 seats in the 120-memberParliament. In 1984, one in four Arabs voted Labor, giving theparty the three seats that provided its 44-41 advantage over Likud.   But this year, support for Labor is slipping, mainly because ofgrowing Israeli Arab identification with the 10-month-old uprisingthat has claimed at least 299 Palestinian and six Israeli lives.Analysts say Labor could lose 1.5 seats in the Arab sector.   ``Many people don't want to vote for Labor because of what Rabinis doing in the occupied territories,'' said a 37-year-oldcarpenter in the Arab town of Nazareth near Shfaram. The man, whosaid he supported Labor in 1984, spoke on condition of anonymity.   Asked whether Rabin was a liability for Labor's Arab campaign,Peres was evasive. ``I think they (Arab voters) must understand thesituation as it is, and I hope they will change their minds,'' hetold The Associated Press in Shfaram.   But Communist Party activists in Shfaram were optimistic thatthe revolt against Israeli occupation would boost their chances.   ``We'll get more votes because of the uprising,'' said localparty leader Sagir Moussa, 39, as he and other activists handed outleaflets saying ``Yes to a Palestinian state'' and ``Long live theuprising.''   His party might gain one seat this year, bringing its total tofive, according to recent polls Labor has conducted among Arabvoters. The polls were cited by the Jerusalem Post newsaper.   According to the polls, the Progressive List for Peace wouldmaintain its strength with two seats, while Labor would win 1.5seats. Six other parties, including the Likud, would share theremaining four seats, an unidentified Labor official told thenewspaper Monday.   A 26-year-old Shfaram resident, who would only give his firstname, Ahmed, said he was not convinced by Peres' speech. He alsocriticized Peres for promising true equality, better schools andmore jobs for Israeli Arabs if Labor is elected.   ``Every four years they discover that we exist,'' said Ahmed, ahairdresser. ``They make promises, but nothing changes.''</TEXT></DOC>
