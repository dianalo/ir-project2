The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it has been concerned about the effectiveness of job-safety efforts in California since Gov. George Deukmejian announced in February that the program would end June 30. The governor's proposed budget action has been contested in the state Legislature and in court, OSHA said.    California is one of 23 states with its own job-safety and health program. Federal law requires that these states' regulations and enforcement be at least as effective as OSHA's.    OSHA said that on July 1 it will resume &quot;concurrent&quot; federal enforcement in California. That means the agency will directly enforce its regulations in the state regardless of whether any state program is still in effect. </TEXT></DOC>
