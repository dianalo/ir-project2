New York Gov. Mario Cuomo introduced legislation that he saidwould outlaw flag burning without a constitutional amendment, whiletwo people in Florida were arrested in separate flag destructionsand an Arkansas judge was asked to block a flag burning.   The unfurling of flag issues comes two weeks after the U.S.Supreme Court overturned a man's conviction in Texas, ruling thatburning the flag as a protest was protected by the Constitution'sfreedom of speech guarantee.   In Austin, Texas, state Sen. Craig Washington sought to block aresolution that asks members of Congress to support a constitutionalamendment making flag burning not a protected right of the FirstAmendment.   He began his stalling tactics at 1:25 p.m. Thursday and ended itat 1:40 a.m. CDT today.   ``I was prepared to go the rest of the night,'' Washington said.``I don't think I could have gone much longer than noon.''   It was unclear whether Senate leaders would bring up theresolution later today.   Washington, who opposes flag burning, said the issue isprotection of the First Amendment and nothing else.   ``The Constitution has earned the right to be saluted,'' he said.   Washington also said the resolution had no purpose.   ``It is utterly without substance, it is nothing more than asymbolic occasion for us to tell our constituencies and the worldhow we feel about this issue,'' he said.   The effects of the hours of talking seemed to get to Washington.   At one point, he rubbed his head and said, ``I'm starting to geta little stir crazy.''   Later, Rep. Senfronia Thompson got on her knees and massaged hislegs.   Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance, a likely Republican candidatefor Texas governor in 1990, said Washington was out of line.   ``The people of this state don't want the U.S. flag burned, andCraig Washington should be able to understand that,'' Hance said.   The resolution passed the Texas House last week, when membersstood and recited the pledge of allegiance, and an early test votein the Senate was 23-2 in support.   Elsewhere, Cuomo's legislative proposal would make the simple actof burning a flag other than for legal disposal purposes illegal andpunishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.   Cuomo said his bill would not violate the First Amendment'sfreedom of speech guarantees because it deletes ``any reference toconduct that has a communicative or expressive impact on others.''   The New York Democrat said the proposal was preferable toPresident Bush's call for a constitutional amendment becauseprotection for the flag could be provided much faster. The governoralso said ``tampering'' with the First Amendment would establish adangerous precedent.   In Florida, 19-year-old Robert Rase of Jacksonville was chargedwith grand theft for allegedly stealing a 20-foot-by-38-foot flagoutside a complex that houses the FBI and Secret Service. DetectiveRobert Bogers said Rase cut up the flag, attached the blue fieldwith stars to his bedroom ceiling, and covered a sofa with thestripes.   In Gainsville, Fla., art student Terry Towery, 25, was releasedfrom jail Wednesday after his arrest for burning a U.S. flag alongwith paintings and other art objects in a Tuesday night theatricalperformance he said was in honor of free speech.   Police said they arrested Towery because he violated the city'sburning ordinance. He faces a misdemeanor charge of making a bonfirewithout a permit and within 150 feet of a building.   In another case, Arkansas Secretary of State Bill McCuen askedPulaski County Chancellor Judge Lee Munson to block a flag burningscheduled for Sunday by Robert ``Say'' McIntosh at the stateCapitol. McCuen's petition contended that earlier attempts byMcIntosh to burn a U.S. flag resulted in damage and endangeredpeople.   On Monday, Munson declined to block the burning.</TEXT></DOC>
