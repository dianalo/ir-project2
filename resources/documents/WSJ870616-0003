Separately, in an unrelated effort to clear the way for a proposed public offering of some of its other units, Beatrice offered to pay its bondholders more money for proposed changes in their bond covenants.    Beatrice said its Arrowhead Drinking Water Co., based in Monterey Park, Calif., is the nation's leading processor and distributor of bottled water. Its products sell under the Arrowhead, Ozarka and Great Bear brand names.    The companies wouldn't disclose the value of the transaction or Arrowhead's sales or earnings. Emanuel Goldman, analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Franciso, estimated Arrowhead's annual sales at slightly more than $200 million.    &quot;It's a big deal for Perrier,&quot; said Mr. Goldman, adding that the bottled-water business generates annual U.S. sales of about $1.5 billion and is growing at a 10% annual clip.    A Perrier spokeswoman said completion of the sale, subject to compliance with regulatory requirements, is expected in about 60 days. In addition to Perrier mineral water, Perrier of America's brands include Poland Spring and Calistoga.    Since being taken private in April 1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout, Beatrice has rapidly reduced its debt by selling various units. Last month, it said it plans an initial public offering for its remaining non-food businesses and some of its smaller specialty-food lines.    A spokesman for Beatrice said the company is revising a solicitation statement to bondholders in which it asks them to relax some restrictive covenants. Among other things, the spokesman said, the revised statement calls for increasing the amount bondholders would receive for their consent to the changes.    Their approval is needed for the public offering to go through. Some bondholders had complained that the previous $2.50 offer for each $1,000 face amount of securities was too low. The new solicitation increases that offer to $12.50 for the company's 11% senior 10-year notes and $10 for three other issues, the 12 1/2% 12-year senior subordinated debentures due 1998, 12 3/4% 15-year subordinated debentures due 2001 and 15-year floating rate debentures due to 2001. </TEXT></DOC>
