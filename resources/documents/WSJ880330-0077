But with the approach of 1997, when China regains sovereignty over Hong Kong, another exodus has started.    The exodus is most pronounced among middle-class managers and skilled professionals worried that Beijing might renege on its promise to maintain Hong Kong's freedoms and exuberant capitalism for 50 years after 1997. Businessmen say a brain drain is sapping the best and brightest local employees.    Lame-duck British officials are trying to minimize the extent of the departures, arguing that emigration from crowded Hong Kong isn't a new phenomenon. They claim that many people return after obtaining a foreign passport -- suggesting confidence in the colony's economy, if not in its political outlook. Officials estimate the net annual outflow at 18,000 to 20,000.    &quot;The level of emigration has been much the same as it is now for more than 20 years,&quot; Sir David Wilson, Hong Kong's governor, has said.    But mounting evidence indicates otherwise. Hong Kong residents seeking to emigrate must obtain a &quot;certificate of no criminal record&quot; that foreign governments require before they will issue an immigration visa. Last year police issued a record 52,000 certificates, almost 50% more than in 1986 and more than double the annual average of 21,000 in 1982-85.    Because the Hong Kong government doesn't compile emigration statistics, the number of police certificates issued provides the best indication of how many people are trying to leave the colony. The sharp increase is mirrored by a rise in migrant visas issued to Hong Kong residents by Canada and Australia, the destinations of most emigrants.    On a rainy day, a cross section of Hong Kong streams into the small Royal Hong Kong Police office adjacent to a local immigation office by Victoria Park to apply for their certificates. Whole families take their turn at the fingerprint counter. Despite expressions of hope for brighter prospects and security abroad, when asked why they are leaving, one after another replies: 1997.    A well-dressed couple, wiping fingerprint ink from their hands, say they are going to the U.S. to join the husband's father. The husband says he is a banker. &quot;I'm not worried about 1997 for myself,&quot; the man says. &quot;It's for my children.&quot;    A young woman says she is joining her husband in Canada. He was a banker in Hong Kong, but now he is working in a Toronto bookstore. Why did he give up a better job here? &quot;He's worried about 1997.&quot;    It is a rare company that hasn't lost managers and professional staff since the 1984 Sino-British declaration that set 1997 as the date for China to regain sovereignty. Departures accelerated last year and haven't abated, businessmen say.    Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp., the colony's largest bank, says 56, or 8%, of its 670 locally employed executives emigrated in 1987. That is almost triple the number in 1986. &quot;This wasn't an issue before 1986,&quot; a spokesman says. &quot;We've been a cradle-to-grave company. We don't have a reputation for losing people.&quot;    Pandamp;E Risk Consultancy Ltd. forecasts that 50,000 people a year will leave over the next decade, or almost 10% of the population. Most are heading for Canada, Australia and the U.S.    In 1987, Canada issued 22,000 migrant visas to Hong Kong citizens, more than double the 1986 number. Officials caution, however, that part of the increase came from pent-up demand after Canada last year reopened a skilled-worker immigration category that had been closed for four years. About 500,000 Chinese, mostly of Hong Kong origin, already live in Canada. Toronto is expected to displace New York soon as the city with the largest Chinese population in North America.    Australia expects to issue 8,500 visas to Hong Kong residents during the year ending June 30, up 60% for the 12 months.    An even larger number of people is asking how they can leave. Each business day, the Canadian Commission in Hong Kong gives out about 400 migrant-visa applications. The Australian Consulate distributes 200 a day and says it receives about 13,000 related inquiries a month.    Large countries with sparse populations, Canada and Australia encourage immigration of skilled and entrepreneurial people. The U.S., on the other hand, has an immigration quota system determined mainly by kinship. About 7,400 U.S. visas went to Hong Kong residents in 1987, about the same as the two previous years. But the U.S. Senate and House have passed bills to reduce the large family-migrant backlog while opening a new category for entrepreneurs willing to invest $1 million in a business with at least 10 employees.    The Hong Kong Institute of Personnel Management asked major companies to track emigration since the signing of the Sino-British agreement in 1984. The survey will be published next month, but a preliminary reading shows &quot;a very visible growth in emigration, with high impact in managerial levels, where it hurts most,&quot; says Patrick Maule, institute president. Contrary to government claims that many people are returning once they obtain passports, Mr. Maule says the survey shows only one person returning to work in Hong Kong for every 10 leaving.    Lack of confidence in the future feeds the exodus, says Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at Chinese University. Hopes were high after the signing of the Sino-British agreement that Hong Kong might be able to maintain its promised &quot;high degree of autonomy&quot; after 1997, he says. But these hopes have been eroded by China's objections to democratic reform in the colony ahead of 1997 and by Britain's backpedaling from widely expected reforms, Mr. Cheng contends.    He says Hong Kong people &quot;know that democracy simply isn't on. The choice now is to emigrate or, if they can't, stay quiet and keep their fingers crossed.&quot;    Beijing's spokesmen in Hong Kong take note of the increasing emigration but suggest there is little they can do beyond emphasizing they mean to keep their promise of &quot;one country, two systems&quot; for administering the territory.    Xu Jiatun, head of China's offical Xinhua news agency and Beijing's chief unofficial representative in Hong Kong, recently attributed middle-class unease to the fact that many residents, or their parents, fled China during the civil war that led to the 1949 Communist victory or during subsequent mass political campaigns. &quot;They have a disbelief of the Communist Party, and this is only natural,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
