But inside Loop 820 that circlesFort Worth, his home district, it's business as usual.   Aides in Wright's Texas office aren't hearing complaints aboutthe congressman, they say, just the usual requests fromconstituents seeking help with Social Security checks or a passport.   And local Republican leaders say the charges alone won't hurtthe powerful Democrat.   ``Where there's a lot of smoke you ought to at least look forthe fire, but I don't think the smoke is going to cause himproblems,'' said Jim Ryan, GOP chairman in Tarrant County.   Ryan said the ethics investigation ``may plow him under, orvindicate him and make him a hero.''   The House Ethics Committee voted unanimously Friday toinvestigate charges lodged by Wright's political enemy, Rep. NewtGingrich, R-Ga., and Common Cause, a non-profit group that monitorsgovernment ethics.   They allege that Wright lobbied on behalf of oil interests in acase in which he had a financial stake, that he received unusuallyhigh royalties for a book he wrote that was published in 1985 by alongtime associate and campaign contractor, that he used a CapitolHill staffer and office funds to help draft the book, and that heused a Fort Worth condominium, owned by the family of a businesspartner, without having to pay a monthly rent.   Larry Shannon, who directs Wright's district office, saidThursday the office has received 12 telephone calls in the past twoweeks concerning the salvo of charges fired Gingrich.   Of those 12, two were negative, while the rest were encouraging,similar to comments Shannon said he received while making rounds inthe conservative 12th District that stretches over the northerntwo-thirds of Tarrant County.   The district, about 30 miles west of Dallas, is known for itsrowdy frontier image, exemplified by its Fort Worth Stockyardstourist attraction.   But the city's collar has whitened with high-technologyindustries such as Tandy Corp., Bell Helicopter and GeneralDynamics.   Local Democrats say their Republican counterparts have little tocomplain about because Wright has been an effective congressman forthe district.   Since his arrival in Congress in 1955, Wright has been aprodigious provider of federal dollars for Fort Worth, especiallyin the form of defense contracts, and he has one of the mostpolitically safe districts in the nation. He faces no Republicanopponent in the November election.   ``He is a supporter of his friends, even his Republicanfriends,'' said Frank Barron, a longtime Tarrant County Democrat.   Wright and other Democrats say the charges are part of a GOPplot to embarrass Wright and the party before the DemocraticNational Convention next month in Atlanta and to take pressure offVice President George Bush and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.Wright has been named chairman of the convention.   Shannon said that when he was eating at a restaurant a manapproached him and said: ``They're picking on that boy of ours upthere, aren't they? You tell them to leave him alone.''   Recently, constituent John Ridgeway went to Wright's Fort Worthoffice to see if the staff could help him find a certain kind ofgovernment stamp for his son's stamp collection. Ridgeway, 39, saidthe ethics charges don't bother him.   ``I read the newspapers every day, but the fact is I don't thinkwe could have a better person up there. He's done a lot for thearea,'' he said.   Ridgeway dismissed the ethics charges as based on politics.``Every four years someone up there has to start slinging mud,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
