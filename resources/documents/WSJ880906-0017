The latest data hint that the economy is finally beginning to cool off.    Businesses are hiring fewer workers. Retailers are reporting sluggish sales. Corporate purchasing managers say the economy is growing with less vigor. The housing industry faces its worst year since the 1982 recession.    &quot;It really is going according to the game plan,&quot; one Fed official said. &quot;We aren't killing growth. We're slowing it down so inflation isn't so much of a danger.&quot;    Stock and bond markets, at least, seemed to agree Friday. Stocks soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 52.28 to 2054.59, its fourth biggest advance this year and the largest since May 31. The bond market staged its strongest rally in more than seven months, as 30-year Treasury bond yields fell to 9.05% from 9.30% the day before.    At about the end of March, the Fed decided the economy was growing so rapidly that it presented a threat of accelerated price and wage inflation. Since then, the Fed has nudged short-term interest rates up about 1 1/2 percentage points, hoping to head off the inflation threat without provoking a recession.    For months, the persistent strength of the economy led many economists and investment managers to predict further interest-rate increases.    Some still do. William H. Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., foresees three to six more months of gradually rising rates before the economy slows.    Lyle Gramley, a former Fed member and now chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, agrees. &quot;The economy has probably as much momentum now as it did before the stock market crash, and {long-term} interest rates aren't as high now as they were then,&quot; he said.    Some forecasters expect third-quarter economic growth to match the 3.3% annual rate of the second quarter, well above the Fed's target of 2% to 2.5%. Exports and business capital spending are still growing smartly.    But if recent signs of slower economic growth are confirmed in coming weeks, the Fed is likely to let interest rates level off.    The government's report Friday that the unemployment rate rose and payroll growth was slower in August than in earlier months is &quot;a welcome sign to the monetary policy makers,&quot; said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. &quot;There is every reason for them to hold to stable monetary policy now,&quot; he said.    Samuel Kahan of Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago said, &quot;Any pressure {on the Fed} to raise rates will be put on hold.&quot;    Even before the Labor Department report, new Fed member John LaWare said in an interview: &quot;We are beginning to see slightly mixed signals. Housing starts are down a little bit. New orders are down a little bit. These are the kind of things that lead you to believe that things are slowing down.&quot; Mr. LaWare added, however, &quot;I'm not yet able to discern a trend.&quot;    There are economists who doubt the Fed can slow the economy sufficiently through modest increases in interest rates. &quot;It usually turns out -- and is likely to again -- that small, gradual increases don't accomplish the job of slowing the economy,&quot; Albert Wojnilower of First Boston Corp. said.    And both inside and outside the Fed, many argue that it takes greater swings in interest rates to slow the economy than it did a decade ago. &quot;The impact {of higher rates} is more gradual. Maybe that's healthier,&quot; said Martha Seger, the Fed member who has been the most reluctant to raise rates.    The housing industry isn't as sensitive to interest rates as it was a decade or two ago, when Fed actions could quickly shut off mortgage lending by thrift institutions. Adjustable-rate mortgages also mean that some people are willing to buy houses when rates are high, knowing they won't be saddled with the high rates forever.    On the other hand, homeowners and other consumers may be squeezed a little more when rates rise. Payments on adjustable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and some credit cards rise as interest rates go up, leaving households with less to spend on other things -- although at the same time, households with variable-rate investments such as money market funds benefit from higher rates.    Some corporate economists expect businesses to continue to invest heavily in plant and equipment even if financing costs increase. &quot;One reason that works so much in favor of capital spending, and makes interest rates something companies are willing to shrug off, is the potential of exports,&quot; said Walter Joelson, chief economist for General Electric Co. &quot;This international dimension is a force that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago.&quot;    That's good news for the Fed, which would prefer to slow the economy without a substantial impact on business investment. &quot;If you had your druthers,&quot; said Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, &quot;you would desire to have business spending for capital investment continue, because it should lay the foundation for future growth in productivity and output.    &quot;One of the things that we were hoping was that in the period ahead you'd see most of the source of strength in the economy coming from exports. The best thing would be for the other sectors to grow less rapidly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
