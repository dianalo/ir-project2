Asian countries lead the list of 34 nations that U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, in a recent report, said have erectedsubstantial trade barriers against U.S. products.   The report was the first step in naming countries Washingtonwill target for intensive negotiations aimed at eliminating thetrade barriers. A decision on the final list is expected May 30.   Japan headed the list of alleged trade offenders, followed bySouth Korea, Taiwan, India and Malaysia. Other Asian countriesnamed in the report included China, Indonesia, Pakistan, thePhilippines and Thailand.   For decades, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan relied on exports tothe United States to fuel their growth into industrial powerhouses.If they do not reciprocate by opening their markets to U.S.-madegoods, under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act they face possibleretaliation in the form of up to 100 percent tariffs on selectedimports.   The United States either must increase exports to Asia or slashits imports from the region in order to substantially cut its tradedeficit.   Over two-thirds of the $137.34 billion U.S. trade deficit in1988 was with Asian countries. Acccording to U.S. figures,America's largest trade imbalance was a $55.4 billion deficit withJapan.   The U.S. trade representative's report singles out 32 Japanesebarriers to foreign imports, including rice, supercomputers,semiconductors, telecommunications and tobacco.   Japanese officials have responded to the new trade law bythreating to challenge U.S. sanctions under the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade, the international trade body.   Japan ``can never accept unilateral actions of the U.S.'' andwould seek mediation under GATT, Japanese economic counselorNobutoshi Akao said.   Tokyo stopped short of such action in 1987 when then-PresidentReagan ordered $300 million in annual U.S. penalties againstJapanese electronics products for alleged violation of a 1986agreement on semiconductor trade. Part of the sanctions have sincebeen lifted.   Many Japanese feel their country has done a lot to open itsmarkets to foreign products and that the United States has nottried hard enough to sell high-quality products in Japan.   Some Japanese officials also are angered by U.S. handling of arecent agreement to jointly produce Japan's next fighter jet. U.S.congressmen demanded a renegotiation of the pact, charging Tokyowas using it to acquire U.S. technology, even though it had hopedto develop the plane alone.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a press briefingThursday that listing Japan as a serious free trade violator couldprovoke a strong emotional reaction among the Japanese.   In some Asian nations, there was little or no public response tothe USTR report, but the reaction in Taiwan and South Korea wasbitter.   Fearing a strong anti-American backlash, South Korea dispatchedtop economic officials to Washington for talks about alleged tradebarriers on agricultural products, telecommunications, governmentprocurement and financial services.   South Korea agreed on a new set of import liberalizationmeasures that officials hoped would prevent penalty sanctions. Theagreement did not include farm imports.   U.S. retaliation would be seen by the public as ``too harsh,''said Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho. ``I'm sure it would be addingto instability from which the Korean government is alreadysuffering.''   There have been sporadic violent clashes between police andfarmers in Korea in recent years as the government gradually openedits markets to imports of wine, cigarettes, beef and otherproducts. Anti-American sentiment has grown, fueled by adissident-led campaign against U.S. trade pressure.   Seoul also has threatened to file complaints with GATT and hasrefused further devaluation of its currency, the won. A weaker wonmakes South Korean products less competitive in overseas markets.   The United States has accused South Korea and Taiwan ofmanipulating their exchange rates to boost their trade surpluses,although U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said earlier thismonth that Taiwan has made progress in that area.   The USTR report charges Taiwan with unfair import licensing,farm subsidies and ineffective protection of intellectual propertyrights.   Taiwanese officials responded they had done much to liberalizethe local market and narrow the nation's trade gap with the UnitedStates.   ``It is extremely unfair to include us in the report,'' saidVincent Siew, vice chairman of the government's Council forEconomic Planning and Development.   In March, Taiwan presented a four-year timetable for reducingits U.S. trade surplus by at least 10 percent annually. The surplustotaled $10.4 billion last year, down 35 percent from 1987.   In April, Taiwan announced tariff cuts on hundreds of items andsaid it would revise laws on insurance and banking and crack downon pirate videos. It has refused, however, to further open itsagricultural market, saying it must protect local farmers.   India, charged with unfair import policies, export subsidies andpoor protection of intellectual property rights, countered bysaying the U.S. threats violate GATT rules.   Commerce Minister Dinesh Singh called the 1988 Trade Act unfairand said India would pursue the issue to protect its interests.   Thailand and Malaysia also objected to the threat of U.S. tradesanctions.   Bangkok, which enjoyed a $1.4 billion surplus with the UnitedStates in 1988, is under fire for inadequate protection of U.S.pharmaceutical patents. It asked for more time to deal with theproblem and in turn accused Washington of unfair farm subsidies.   A Foreign Ministry official who demanded anonymity said Thailandhad its own complaints against U.S. agriculture subsidies. TheAmericans ``are subsidizing their 11,000 rice farmers by up to $1billion a year, whereas Thailand has millions of rice farmers whoare very poor and cannot sell their rice because of subsidies,'' hesaid.   In Malaysia, the pro-government New Straits Times alsocriticized the U.S. accusations of unfair trade barriers inagricultural products, especially palm oil, Malaysia's main exportto the United States.   Malaysia posted a $1.7 billion trade surplus with the UnitedStates last year.</TEXT></DOC>
