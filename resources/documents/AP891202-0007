Pete Wilson.   The guests at the Century Plaza Hotel on Wednesday night wereall abuzz over Reagan's undyed gray hair.   ``The Prez looks like a Supreme Court justice all of a sudden _very distinguished,'' said Joyce Valdez, the GOP fund-raiser whoput together the event, which was attended by 700 people and raised$700,000 for Wilson's campaign. Actors Sylvester Stallone andCharlton Heston also attended.   Wilson fell out of favor with Reagan in 1976, when he backedGerald R. Ford at the GOP presidential primary. But there were nohard feelings Wednesday.   ``Pete's not one for raising taxes,'' Reagan said to the roarsof the crowd, ``unlike the Democrats, who look at your paychecksthe way Colonel Sanders looks at chickens.''</TEXT><DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Judge Joseph Wapner, who has dispensed hisown brand of justice on ``The People's Court'' for nine years, saidthe syndicated television show has helped viewers make sense of thecourt system.   The program set off a flurry of small claims cases when it beganairing in 1981. But that was the show's intent, Wapner said Fridayin an address to the eighth biennial Bench-Bar-News Mediaconference.   Before ``The People's Court,'' many people didn't know there wasa small claims court, where to find it or how to use it, he said.   ``We're trying to educate people. Judges should try to demystifythe judicial system,'' he said.   Wapner, 69, explains every decision after he rules on a case. Hesaid the same practice should be followed by most judges.   ``The litigants are entitled to know why you're deciding thecase the way you are,'' he said. ``Those three steps to the benchdon't make you a god. You're appointed, but not annointed.''   Wapner, who has been nominated for four Emmys, turned toelectronic justice after retiring from the bench in 1979 afterserving 20 years as a judge in the Municipal and Superior courts ofLos Angeles.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Roseanne Barr isn't exactly petite, but aSaturday morning cartoon based on her character has tentativelybeen titled ``Little Roseanne.''
