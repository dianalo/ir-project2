Reproducible single waves with constant limitingcurrents over a potential range of 0.5 volt were obtained after the sampleswere electrochemically treated: anodic polarization at 2.0 V vs. SCEand subsequent cathodic reduction. The number of electrons transferredin the oxygen reduction reaction was calculated to be 2.3. The surfaceof the glassy carbon was examined by XPS at different stages of the electrochemicaltreatment. After the anodic treatment, the ratio of O/C was 0.42. Thepredominant oxygen species were carbonyl groups. Following reduction,the surface had an O/C ratio of 0.24 with the oxygen distributed betweenphenolic and carboxylic groups.</TEXT></DOC>
