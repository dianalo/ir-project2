MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The political turmoil in South Korea hasn't hurt the nation's vibrant economy, but it is starting to worry domestic and foreign executives.    &quot;It's having zero impact on the economy,&quot; says the manager of a U.S. bank here. &quot;There's so much resilience, so much momentum in the economy right now, that it would take one heck of a major demonstration or one terribly serious level of insurrection to stop it. Martial law might do it, but even that would take a period of months to hurt the economy.&quot;    Bankers and Trade Ministry officials confirm that exports haven't dropped noticeably since the street violence began on June 10. Nor has there been a slowdown in the opening of letters of credit, which reflect advance orders.    Executives also say the turmoil hasn't substantially disrupted day-to-day business. But with the international media sending out images of tear-gassed citizens and policemen set afire, there is concern that foreigners may come to regard Korea as a bad place to work or invest.    &quot;I wake up every morning lately and ask myself whether this is going to be the day I have to begin thinking seriously about our continued presence in Korea,&quot; says a foreign sales agent. &quot;So far, I haven't had to face that. But the situation is such that it could come at any time.&quot;    Still, a Western banker here notes that Japanese executives, who are the biggest investors in Korea and usually the most skittish about political problems, are still rushing to put money into the country.    In the U.S., most executives and Asia experts contacted say they see no reason for alarm. They view Korea's strife as a flare-up in a family squabble that will ease. Few companies in the U.S. are even worried enough to draw up contingency plans to handle a halt in Korean exports.    But some experts in the U.S. argue that companies should be worried more and that the protest in Korea is deeper and fundamentally different from past strife and will worsen. &quot;There's going to be more violence and a lot more bloodshed,&quot; says Thomas P. Crowley, who was a Korea-based executive for General Electric Co.    Mr. Crowley, who does consulting work on Asia for U.S. companies, sees major differences from past Korean protests: escalating violence against the police, emerging support of the protests by the middle class, rising resentment of the military, and an increasingly strident anti-American element. &quot;If there's more violence, we {Americans} are going to be blamed for it,&quot; he says.    The Korean economy, powered by the export sector, has seemed immune to the turmoil. &quot;Manufacturers have so many orders already in the pipeline,&quot; says another U.S. bank manager in Seoul. &quot;So many {foreign} businessmen are still in town, as far as I know.&quot; He says that &quot;some of our people have had trouble getting flights in and out of the country, but the business flow continues uninterrupted.&quot;    Nevertheless, exporters are among the most nervous executives here. &quot;Given the fact that this is a heavily export-oriented economy, what is of particular concern is if buyers start worrying that delivery time may be extended or that there might be interruptions in the flow of goods because of the civil unrest,&quot; says a third American banker here.    June is a busy time for sportswear production as companies gear up for the back-to-school season. Reebok International Ltd. of Canton, Mass., gets about 90% of its supply of sneakers from Korea, while Beaverton, Ore.-based Nike Inc. obtains between 30% and 40%, according to industry experts. A spokesman for Reebok said the company hasn't had any problems in Korea stemming from the disturbances, and a Nike spokesman said the company is receiving reports of business as usual there.    West German-owned Adidas USA gets less than 10% of its sportswear from South Korea, and thus is more concerned with its role as the &quot;official outfitter&quot; for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. But it is confident the games won't be jeopardized. Says a spokesman: &quot;We feel the Koreans will be able to get it under control.&quot;    Sales and marketing executives for leading Korean electronics makers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Corp. say there haven't been any order cancellations, as happened during previous bouts of Korean instability. But they and other executives acknowledge that news reports of the crisis have set off a flurry of phone calls from customers and head offices asking if deliveries are affected. Some new customers, they say, have delayed signing up.    Says Lee Jun Ho, president of Lucky-Goldstar International Corp., one of Korea's biggest trading houses: &quot;At the moment, there isn't much impact on our actual business performance.&quot; But &quot;my customers and I are very worried that if this crisis should continue, it will eventually have a negative impact on the economy and the business climate.&quot;    Nam Duck Woo, chairman of the Korea Traders Association, concedes that the violence and uncertainty make for &quot;a very unfavorable condition for the business community.&quot; But &quot;in a sense, domestic business leaders and our longtime foreign business leaders have become somewhat immune to these kinds of disturbances. So buyers are still coming, and the export performance is, as usual, very rapid.&quot;    A U.S. banker acknowledges a deepening concern that the political crisis might drag on: &quot;If there's a quick surgical thing that resolves the problem in the next three or four weeks, there may not be much effect on the long-term business environment. But if it takes longer, the business environment will suffer.&quot;    Securities analysts, usually the business group most sensitive to political instability, are divided on how investment has been affected. &quot;The political situation here usually doesn't have any influence on the stock market at all,&quot; says Han Kyung Soo, an analyst for Daewoo Securities Co. &quot;We have had political turmoil for 25 years.&quot;    Others are bullish. &quot;Now is a great time to buy,&quot; says Bae Kye Doo, general manager of Dongsuh Investment and Research Institute's investment-advisory department. &quot;In the next two or three weeks there will be a major breakthrough and the stock market will shoot up.&quot;    But foreign analysts are skittish. They see the political crisis as the worst since the assassination of President Park Chung Hee in 1979. &quot;If you are in New York or London, looking at the Korean investment funds, things look pretty bad,&quot; says George Long, Seoul representative of W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd.    Others note that convertible bonds issued by three top Korean companies last year have been falling. &quot;There's no reason other than the political situation that they should have fallen,&quot; says one British securities dealer here. &quot;They should have gone up.&quot;    &quot;We're on the leading edge of a possible revolution,&quot; says the president of a European pharmaceuticals company that has been considering expanding its operations here. &quot;Which way it goes will almost certainly determine the future desirability of investing in this country.&quot;    ---   Dennis Kneale in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
