Massey Coal Co. a four-year labor dispute marked by lawsuits and violent clashes.    The agreement calls for Massey to pay about $2.4 million in settlements and back wages to 92 strikers it had fired. Settlements will include some back pay and a new job, or severance pay.    For its part, the UMW agreed to pay undisclosed sums for damages caused by strikers. The union also will pay undisclosed sums as a compromise to a judgment against the union involving a 1981 dispute with Massey's Marrowbone Development Corp. The original judgment specified that the union pay $7 million.    The settlement was welcomed as a chance to end years of disputes, not as a victory for either side. &quot;This settlement is a compromise and underscores the fact that in a dispute of this magnitude, there are no clear winners,&quot; said Richard L. Trumka, the union's president. Paul Barbery, counsel for Massey in Richmond, Va., said the company is happy with the settlement.    Troubles between the union and Massey began in 1984 when the UMW argued that Massey's mines should be considered a single company and follow one union contract. Massey maintained the company would not negotiate on behalf of its subsidiaries. The National Labor Relations Board upheld the UMW's position.    The strikers involved with the settlement have the right to refuse the offer and pursue their cases individually before the NLRB, the union said.    The settlement also includes new collective bargaining agreements for union-represented employees at Massey operations, located primarily in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky.    The UMW's selective strikes against Massey and all remaining lawsuits and charges pending before the NLRB will be dropped, the union said. </TEXT></DOC>
