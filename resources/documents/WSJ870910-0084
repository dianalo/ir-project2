But a thin, bearded man called Henry still doesn't understand why.    &quot;My God,&quot; he cries, &quot;what did we ever do to the government to deserve this?&quot;    In Mogopa, Henry was a farmer, raising all manner of crops. Here, he is a scavenger, combing the surrounding countryside for discarded bottles that can be redeemed for a couple of cents each. He has tried to cultivate the tiny plot of land surrounding the tin shack that serves as a house for his family, but the land is hard and barren. &quot;This is a desert,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't even grow a flower. If you want one, you have to buy it.&quot;    In Mogopa, Henry was happy and prosperous; the government and its apartheid policies didn't concern him much. But standing here, in work boots that have no laces and hardly any soles, he is an angry young man, an enemy of apartheid. After years of plotting, he and his people are determined to return to Mogopa, unless the men in Pretoria can come up with a suitable alternative site, where flowers and corn grow and cattle can graze.    &quot;We may die trying, but we want to go back to Mogopa, or to a land we can call our own,&quot; says Henry, who is 34 years old. &quot;We're not troublemakers. The people of Mogopa are peaceful. But when you get hit and hit and hit, you eventually hit back.&quot;    Beginning today, the people of Mogopa will tear down their shacks and pack their belongings and move to another dusty town called Onderstepoort, west of Bethanie. There -- where they will at least have clean water and slightly better housing -- they will wait for three months, giving the government one last chance to avoid a fight before they move to Mogopa. The government has promised a solution by the end of November.    The alienation of the 3,000 displaced people of Mogopa is a classic South African story of how contentment turns to rage and how enemies are made of friends. It is also an illustration of how the anger and frustration of South Africa's disenfranchised blacks spread from the violent and politicized urban townships to the most meek and isolated rural villages.    The people of Mogopa are a religious lot -- there were four churches in their village -- who believe it is best to turn the other cheek. The older members of the community have been taught to treat the white man with deference, and they still call unfamiliar whites &quot;master&quot; and &quot;madam.&quot; The younger ones share little of the political fire burning within their black-township counterparts, who are bent on seizing power from the white government.    Yet, in their own way, the people of Mogopa are as radical as the townships' stone-throwing youths. The Mogopas, as they are known, aren't concerned with power; they just want to live the way they did, and to be left alone. Their mission to correct the wrongs of apartheid is imbued with a Messianic zeal.    &quot;The Israelites of old wandered for many years before Moses led them to the Promised Land,&quot; says Daniel Moloatsi, who is 57. &quot;It is the same for the people of Mogopa.&quot;    To the Mogopas, their home was a land of milk and honey. Mogopa, which was bought and settled by black farm laborers in 1912 (blacks could own land then), was on the windy plains about 15 miles north of the conservative white rural town of Ventersdorp. Mr. Moloatsi remembers the peach tree that flowered in his yard and the cattle that grazed in the fields. Matthew Kgatitsoe, 65, recalls the fat of the land and the close community life.    &quot;We had everything we needed,&quot; says Mr. Kgatitsoe. &quot;We had corn and vegetables and milk, and the cattle were so fat. We built our own schools and churches and shops. We didn't ask the government for anything. We were happy by ourselves.&quot;    This happiness came to an abrupt halt on Valentine's Day, 1984. The government had declared the community a &quot;black spot&quot; in the white farming area and, according to the tenets of grand apartheid, wanted the residents to move to Bophuthatswana, one of the newly created black tribal homelands. Bulldozers tore down the buildings of Mogopa and trucks hauled the people away. At first they were taken to a place called Pachsdraai, where the community headman had settled. Some of the people stayed there, but most left for Bethanie to get away from their leader, who they felt had sold out to the government.    Today, searching for Mogopa is like hunting for a lost civilization. Steers graze on the tall yellow grass where the town used to stand. Piles of brick and stone mark the ruins of the buildings. About all that remains is the cemetery, where the Mogopas still bury their dead.    The international outcry over the demolition of Mogopa, and a South African appeals-court decision saying it was invalid, has saved several other black communities from suffering the same fate. Although the government continues to occasionally remove blacks from their homes in the name of &quot;orderly urbanization,&quot; Mogopa was the last established town to be totally demolished.    This is little consolation to the Mogopa people. In Bethanie, they have been turned into squatters, living in houses made from the corrugated steel and wood they brought with them from Mogopa. Newspaper is used both to insulate the shacks and to roll cigarettes. The drinking water isn't purified. The old people have been unable to get their pensions. The children play in dirt yards scattered with broken glass and chicken droppings. The men have been unable to find work.    What's worse, the community has been split. Most of the families live in Bethanie, but, because of a lack of space, others have settled several miles away in the towns of Berseba and Modikwe. Several of the men, including Mr. Kgatitsoe, have moved to Soweto, the big black township near Johannesburg, in search of jobs.    &quot;We're tired of living like this,&quot; says Mr. Kgatitsoe. &quot;We are farmers. We are a community.&quot; At least by moving temporarily to Onderstepoort, he says, the Mogopa people will be back together again, making it easier to carry on the fight to return to Mogopa or some other place where they can have their own land.    Henry, however, wants to head straight back to Mogopa. &quot;Whenever they tell us 'you don't go to Mogopa,' I feel like I've lost my wind,&quot; he says, slumping over. &quot;I have a bad feeling about this new place, too. It is time to go home.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
