The previous national day was Aug. 23, commemorating the date in1944 when Romania broke its alliance with the Axis and sided withthe Allies in World War II. The alliance with the Soviet Unionpaved the way for 45 years of communist domination of this country.   Dec. 1 marks the 1918 union of Transylvania with the otherprovinces comprising present-day Romania _ Wallachia and Moldavia.   The proposal must also pass a vote in the House of Deputies,which is scheduled to debate the issue Wednesday. The Senate votewas seen, however, as ensuring its final passage.   The choice of a date not directly related to last December'srevolution that toppled the communist dictatorship reflects populardisagreement over which date is most important _ Dec. 16-17, whenriots in the western city of Timisoara began the uprising, or theoverthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22.   ``Neither (possible date) can give people the right to cancelDec. 1,'' said Sen. Dan Iosif of the ruling National SalvationFront. ``Communists alone dared to cancel it. Let's hope no one isever so bold as to do it again.''   But Laura Anton, 23, reflected the opinion of some moreconcerned with recent events than the country's history: ``I do notthink it is fair that the national day be Dec. 1, since it meansnothing to us,'' she insisted. ``It should be either Dec. 22 or atleast Dec. 17.''</TEXT></DOC>
