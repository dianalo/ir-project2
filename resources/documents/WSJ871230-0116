Christensen was unfairly critical of licensed adoption agencies, saying that birth mothers avoid agencies because of red tape, delay, embarrassing interviews and foster-care placement of their babies. I cannot imagine what agencies could be charged with such practices today. This is certainly not true of state-licensed private adoption agencies and Spence-Chapin in New York City, where birth parents see one worker who is a qualified professional. The service is given immediately upon request, without delay; and the infants, if adoption is the birth parents' plan, are placed directly into waiting adoptive homes.    Unlike the service to adoptive parents given by attorneys, private agencies assist adoptive parents through the adoption process and the child is supervised in the home for six months until the adoption is finalized. The interests of all parties are protected in agency adoption.    As for his reference to the Steinberg case and cheering independent adoptions, the issue is not whether children are better off in independent adoptions than raised by single parents, but how well off they are in independent adoptions compared with licensed agency adoptions. When birth parents transfer their rights, they expect loving care and protection for their infants. A licensed adoption agency is best suited to provide this child-welfare service.    Jane D.
