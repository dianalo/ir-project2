U.S. companies &quot;are wrestling with the fact that thecenter of Europe has probably shifted,&quot; says James Searing,director of international business services for financialservices firm Ernst andamp; Young. Growth in some of Europe'sup-and-coming regions has left most U.S. companies&quot;under-represented on the continent. Their market share isn'twhat it could be,&quot; says Mr. Searing.</LP><TEXT>   A recent Ernst andamp; Young study of 64 regions of the EC, onfactors ranging from taxes to energy and labor costs, pointsto superior manufacturing sites in Ireland, Spain andPortugal; better research and development, or Randamp;D, centers insouthern France; and advantages of locating Europeanheadquarters in the Benelux countries.   &quot;The key point is the diversity of Europe,&quot; saysJean-Claude Goldenstein, senior manager of EC advisoryservices for New York-based Ernst andamp; Young. &quot;There's no singleanswer.&quot;   To take advantage of what is to become the largest singlemarket in the world after 1992, Nalco Chemical Co., forexample, based in Naperville, Ill., has tentative plans toconsolidate its European operations in the Netherlands inearly 1994.   Nalco, which employs 1,300 on the continent and hasEuropean sales currently totaling around $350 million, willmove its European headquarters from Paris to Leiden, theNetherlands, and establish a central Randamp;D facility there.   In choosing Leiden, Nalco considered key factors thatwould attract executives and scientists from a variety ofnations, such as ease of transportation, affordable housingand good schools, says Dave Jackson, executive vice presidentof Nalco's international operations.   That English is widely spoken in the Netherlands &quot;is aplus&quot; for Nalco, says Mr. Jackson.   Ernst andamp; Young's study also ranked southern France high asa location for Randamp;D centers. Ernst andamp; Young's Mr. Searing sayshe sees potential for the Nice-Cannes area to develop into aEuropean version of California's Silicon Valley.   &quot;It has a good airport and railway already in place fortourists, so why not use it for Randamp;D,&quot; says Mr. Searing,adding that southern France is also far less expensive thanGermany for the purpose.   VLSI Technology Inc., a San Jose, Calif., software designand engineering company, already has an Randamp;D facility insouthern France, keeping company with corporate giants suchas Dow Chemical, NCR and Digital Equipment.   VLSI's four-year-old, 50-employee facility inSophia-Antipolis, is the sole Randamp;D center for the company inEurope, where its 1990 net revenue totaled $73.3 million.   &quot;The international airport of Nice was very suitable forus,&quot; says Yves Saboret, VLSI's director of European productdevelopment.   An additional attraction, Mr. Saboret says, was thatFrench law doesn't require foreign companies to employ acertain number of locals. About half of VLSI's softwaredesigners and engineers in France are expatriates, he says.   During the past 10 years local authorities in the Nicearea have deliberately steered economic growth toward thehightech Randamp;D sector, attracting businesses that would notdamage the environment nor require large amounts of space,says Laurent Claude, deputy director of thegovernment-sponsored Invest in France agency in New York.   Sophia-Antipolis, he says, is the heart of southernFrance's Randamp;D corridor. At the end of 1990, 30 U.S. companiesoperated there compared with eight in 1985. A recent decisionby Next Inc. -- the brainchild of Apple Computer Inc.'sco-founder Steven Jobs -- to center its European operationsin Sophia-Antipolis is a &quot;symbolic victory,&quot; Mr. Claude says.   Another twist to the Ernst andamp; Young study was its highranking of Ireland, Spain and Portugal as better locationsfor manufacturing facilities than the United Kingdom for manycompanies.   These countries rate high for their large pool of low-costlabor as well as attractive financial incentives offered bythe governments. Also, as poorer members of the EC, mostregions in Spain and Portugal qualify for sizable ECdevelopment grants.   Ford Motor Co., which still has a formidable manufacturingpresence in the U.K., regards the Iberian peninsula as itsfastest growing production area, says John Gardiner, managerof government affairs for Ford's British arm.   In July, Ford and Volkswagen AG jointly signed a contractwith the Portuguese government to establish a $2.8-billionluxury-van factory south of Lisbon, making it the largestforeign investment in Portugal.   The deal, which is expected to create 5,000 jobs startingin 1994, contains a government incentive package thatincludes a direct grant of $560 million and up to $52 millionin tax exemptions on sales over five years.   Ireland may not have a central location or roads andrailways that link it to the continent, but it boasts ayoung, well-educated, English-speaking workforce, and a 10%ceiling on most corporate taxes.   Ireland aims for a niche in manufacturing high-tech,electronic and software products, Irish Minister for Industryand Commerce Desmond O'Malley says.   More than half of Ireland's 3.6-million population areunder age 28 and one-third are currently enrolled infull-time education. Because of Ireland's relativegeographical isolation, it can't compete with areas on thecontinent better suited for high-volume manufacturing inheavy industry.   Instead, Ireland focuses on manufacturing for &quot;high-value&quot;products in which &quot;a matter of hours difference for deliveryof these products is not a factor,&quot; says Mr. O'Malley.   Stratus Computer Inc., which has a plant outside Dublinwhere it makes computers used in automatic teller machinesand airline reservation systems, ships some of thesecomputers to Asia, says Stratus's treasurer, Mike McConnell.About half of the Marlborough, Mass., company's $450 millionannual revenue comes from sales overseas.   Prior to deciding two years ago to establish its120-employee plant in Irelandits only manufacturing facilityin EuropeStratus had also considered sites in England andScotland, says Mr. McConnell.   &quot;Since we had never expanded outside the U.S. before, wethought an English-language country would be easier for us,&quot;says Mr. McConnell, adding that a highly skilled and reliablework force was also a critical factor.   The Irish government's guarantee of a 10% ceiling oncorporate tax until at least the year 2010 clinched Stratus'sdecision in favor of Ireland over the U.K., says Mr.McConnell.   Non-tax financial incentives offered to the company by theU.K. and Ireland were essentially equal, he says, but Stratuswould have faced a corporate tax rate of about 35% if it hadchosen a U.K. site.</TEXT></DOC>
