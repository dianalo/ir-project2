It was never my intention that they should shy away fromtopics.&quot;;    He said administrators had been concerned about the quality ofthe newspaper. But he said it may have suffered because Hannigan had so manystudents -- 40 -- in one class. The assistant will help &quot;polish writing andreporting,&quot; he said.;    The school principal had told Hannigan two weeks agothat he no longer would serve as adviser, though he still would teach Englishand video production. At the time, Hannigan claimed he was removed because hehad taught students to be aggressive and hard-hitting reporters, resulting inmany unfavorable articles that may have tarnished the school's image. But hesaid Tuesday he believes the latest assurances from administrators that storycontent was not a factor in the decision to remove him.;    But student CindyHuang, who will be the Courier's editor-in-chief next year, was moreskeptical.;    &quot;I'm glad they came to an agreement and we'll get Mr. Hanniganback,&quot; she said. &quot;But I think the real reason is they were a little afraid ofall the publicity and all the controversy. They wanted to settle this before aprotest could happen.&quot;;    The student journalists said the newspaper cameunder fire for several stories, including one about allegedly riggedstudent-body elections; one about signs on campus during the Persian Gulf warthat said &quot;America, love it or leave it;&quot; and an editorial saying black peopleshould rediscover their African roots.;    But Superintendent Emanuele said hehas defended the newspaper's right to publish sensitive articles and evenspoke out at a school board meeting last spring in support of the youngjournalists after several students and parents complained about the editorialon black culture.;    &quot;I have always supported their First Amendment rights topublish stories that came under attack,&quot; Emanuele said Monday. &quot;I'm sayingcategorically that our role is to protect the paper's right to printcontroversial stuff. Why would that story (about rigged elections) upset us?So it occurred and the student body did something about it. That's a veryappropriate story.&quot;;    Hannigan, who formerly worked for the Daily Review ofHayward and the Argus of Fremont, has been the Courier adviser since 1986.;   The Courier has won several awards at the Ohlone College annual high schooljournalism conference, including second place for general excellence in 1988and third place last year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RENEE KOURY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910724  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  538  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 24, 199100206260,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
