The kineticone-dimensional analysis of the ICRF wave is coupled with the anisotropicFokker-Planck equation and the one-dimensional transport code. Spatialtransport coefficients are inferred from those of the drift wave modeland a phenomenological internal disruption is introduced. Calculatedpower deposition profiles agree well with experimental results. Degradationof confinement with increasing heating power, profile modification dueto the off-axis heating and heat pulse propagation after the internaldisruption are well reproduced by our simulation model.</TEXT></DOC>
