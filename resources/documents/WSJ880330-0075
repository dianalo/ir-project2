U.S. District Court Judge Barrington D. Parker in Washington, D.C., late yesterday also temporarily blocked Eastern from using any planes for training of replacement pilots. The judge's order lasts until a trial is held on the union's request for a permanent injunction.    The order dashed plans, at least temporarily, for Eastern to hire Orion Air, a unit of Primark Corp., as well as other contract carriers, to provide replacement crews. Eastern planned to use the outside crews to fly Eastern planes if the Air Line Pilots Association decided to honor picket lines in a looming strike by the International Association of Machinists.    Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., has sought substantial pay cuts from employees since Texas Air acquired it in 1986. The company is currently in mediation with the machinists on their work contract, which became amendable Dec. 31. If the mediator declares an impasse, the union would be free to strike after 30 days, and the company would be free to impose its own contract terms.    Judge Parker ruled that Eastern's contract with its pilots bars the carrier from engaging non-Eastern pilots to fly or train on Eastern aircraft, and that Eastern doesn't have an unrestricted right to pursue pre-strike preparations.    &quot;The practical effect of the order is that it puts a hold on Eastern's plans to establish a 'back up' airline operation in the event of a strike,&quot; the pilots union said in a statement. Added James L. Linsey, a New York lawyer for the pilots, &quot;We're very, very pleased with the judge's ruling, and we look forward to Eastern compliance.&quot;    Eastern hadn't received a copy of the order late yesterday and couldn't immediately comment on the decision.    But Eastern, which once seemed to hold all the cards in the labor negotiations, appears to be running out of aces. Texas Air officials had assumed when they acquired Eastern that if they couldn't extract labor cost savings at the bargaining table, then it could transfer assets away from the carrier, or, if a walkout occurred, it could replace strikers with low-cost employees, much as it did in 1983 when its Continental employees went on strike.    Earlier this month, another federal court ruled that Eastern couldn't transfer its East Coast shuttle operations to a newly formed unit of Texas Air. The ruling is being appealed under an expedited process. </TEXT></DOC>
