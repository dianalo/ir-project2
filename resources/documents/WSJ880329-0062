Staying Healthy   AMERICANS ARE thought to be more knowledgeable than ever about what constitutes healthy behavior. But when individual preventative measures are looked at, it turns out that the number of people actually taking steps to stay healthy varies widely.    A recently published survey of 34,000 households by the National Center for Health Statistics shows, for example, that while 85% of U.S. adults have had their blood pressure checked in the past year, only about half of adult women have had a Pap smear or a breast exam. The use of seat belts in autos is increasing -- but not as much as safety officials would like. About one-third of adults now use a seat belt all or most of the time while driving. A 1980 survey found that only 20% of drivers used belts.    Only 30% of adults said they smoked cigarettes, down from 38% in 1970. And among women smokers who had become pregnant, 21% said they had quit and 36% said they had cut back.    Although the survey found that nearly one-quarter of all adults were more than 20% above the desirable weight for their height, more than half of those people said they were currently trying to lose weight.    One way they may be slimming down is through exercise. Four out of 10 adults reported exercising or playing sports regularly, and 28% said they were very physically active in the preceding two weeks.    ---                       Weighty Matters   Percentage of adults who are 20% or more above their desirable weight:    Men                                           26%    Women                                         22%    Married men                                   30%    Married women                                 22%    Formerly married men                          21%    Formerly married women                        28%   Source: National Center for Health Statistics   Entering an Era   Of Marital Stability?   HIGH DIVORCE rates may be giving way to a period of marital stability. The number of divorces peaked at 1.21 million in 1981 after more than two decades of rapid increase. By 1987 the figure had fallen slightly to 1.16 million. The divorce rate has also declined slightly since peaking in 1979.   According to a report by the American Council of Life Insurance, divorce rates are highest among couples in their twenties. Nearly one-third of all divorces involve couples 20 to 29 years old even though they represent only 14% of all married couples. Thus, as the baby boom moves out of this age group, it seems likely that both the number of divorces and the overall divorce rate will continue to fall.   Who has the highest probability of being divorced? Women age 35 to 39, according to the study. Nearly one-third of their first marriages have already ended in divorce, and the report suggests that the proportion divorcing could eventually exceed one-half.   Conversely, remarriage rates for these women are declining. According to this study for the insurance industry, nearly 70% of women age 35 to 39 in 1975 had remarried after their divorce. By 1985 the figure was down to 63%.   Difficulty in Caring   For the 'Oldest Old'   THE FASTEST growing age group in the nation is the same one on which the federal government spends the most money.   The number of people age 80 and older is currently growing five times faster than the total population and is expected to about double in size in 20 years. The primary reason for this rapid growth is increased life expectancy. A study of the nation's &quot;oldest old&quot; by Cynthia Taeuber of the Census Bureau and Ira Rosenwaike of the University of Pennsylvania shows that in 1950, only 12% of people age 65 could expect to live to 90. Today, more than 25% of 65-year-olds can expect to live that long.   In fiscal 1984, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the U.S. spent $51 billion on people age 80 and older, according to the Census Bureau. That works out to more than $8,500 a person. Taking into account increases in federal outlays since then, the government today is probably spending more than $10,000 per person per year.   In the future, however, this group may become even more dependent on the government.   That's because the average income for this age group is very low, and, soon, there will be fewer sons and daughters to care for them. The last census found that three-quarters of the population age 80 and older had annual incomes under $6,000. But at that time there were 3.65 people age 60 to 69 for every person 80 or older. By the year 2000 there will be fewer than two people in their sixties for every person 80 or older.   Assuming that annual federal expenditures per person for the oldest old could even be held constant at $10,000, the total federal budget for this group in 12 years -- the fiscal year 2000 -- will be about $100 billion. In fact, it will probably be much larger.</TEXT></DOC>
