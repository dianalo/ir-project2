Beggs, the former top administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, says he woke up often last year with the despairing sense that he was living out a Kafkaesque nightmare.    Under indictment for bilking the military of $3.2 million while serving as executive vice president of General Dynamics Corp., Mr. Beggs says neither he nor his lawyers could convince Justice Department prosecutors that he hadn't done anything wrong. &quot;You cannot comprehend the feeling of frustration I had at not being able to bring this thing to a head,&quot; he says.    The bad dream ended this summer. In a highly embarrassing reversal, government prosecutors announced in June that they were dropping all charges in a case that they once trumpeted as a clear example of a defense contractor &quot;pillaging the U.S. Treasury.&quot; The U.S. government had charged St. Louis-based General Dynamics, Mr. Beggs and three other executives with fraud in connection with a contract to build the Divad anti-aircraft gun.    The bizarre case may haunt prosecutors for years to come. Despite an improved record in pressing fraud cases against defense contractors, some Justice Department officials believe the Beggs affair could set a bad precedent in the agency's pursuit of other cases. In the past, some high-ranking law enforcement officials had warned that such fraud cases were a &quot;can of worms&quot; and impossible to win. Now, says one Justice Department official, &quot;we definitely know there is reason for caution.&quot;    The collapse of the General Dynamics's case also came at a time when the Justice Department was catching flak for abandoning other headline defense fraud cases. Those included closing a three-year investigation of questionable cost overruns in General Dynamics' submarine contracts and declining to prosecute Pratt andamp; Whitney Aircraft Group for $22 million in allegedly improper billings. All three cases are the subject of Congressional inquiries, and the Justice Department is conducting an internal review to determine what may have gone wrong.    The episode also illustrates the difficulty of fathoming the arcane workings of the military-industrial complex. Before bringing the case against Mr. Beggs and General Dynamics, Justice Department investigators had to review more than five million separate documents. Even then, prosecutors missed seeing 84 boxes of papers that later contributed to the destruction of their case.    The very complexity of such cases is raising questions in Washington about the ability of either the Justice Department or the military to serve as a watchdog. &quot;We may be finding that defense fraud is almost the perfect crime -- with the taxpayer as victim,&quot; says Rep. Ronald Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.    The prosecution's efforts were also hampered by the need for special security clearances to review classified documents -- which prosecutors sometimes didn't have -- and by the Divad contract itself, which numbered thousands of pages. The biggest obstacle, however, became apparent only as the case wore on: the inability of military procurement officials to decipher the meaning of the very contract that they had helped write.    Early on, a detailed report by the Defense Contract Audit Agency described the Divad agreement as a &quot;fixed price&quot; contract -- one of 96 different types used in acquiring military hardware. Although that interpretation was soundly affirmed by two project managers who were directly involved in the Divad program, another group of military experts later testified that the contract fell into a completely different category. And even when the type of the contract was finally resolved, military experts still couldn't fully agree on all the specifics of what it meant.    Such bickering gave General Dynamics the perfect opening to argue that if the contract was too complicated to figure out, how could it be held accountable for any mistakes it might have made.    &quot;We looked like fools,&quot; confides one member of the prosecuting team.    The weapons program covered under the contract also had a checkered history. In 1978, the Army picked General Dynamics and Ford Motor Co. for a competition that involved building prototypes for a new anti-aircraft gun called Divad, for Division Air Defense. The Army guaranteed each company $39 million for the test models. Ford eventually won the multibillion-dollar contract to produce the gun, but the Army later scrapped the project because the gun didn't work.    Five years later, Defense Department accountants finished working through a backlog of other matters and finally began to review General Dynamics's books for the Divad program. Their audit turned up a number of apparent irregularities, which they found disturbing enough to refer directly to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.    In broad terms, the Defense Contract Audit Agency reported that its review uncovered evidence that General Dynamics, faced with $13 million in cost overruns on the Divad project, may have illegally tried to recover some of its losses by billing the government on other accounts. The agency found, for instance, that company employees specifically assigned to the Divad program had charged all of their labor and travel costs during a four-month period in 1980 to a non-Divad account. Other company expense reports had been &quot;altered&quot; to tap non-Divad accounts, the audit found.    The military audit agency concluded that &quot;significant mischarging of costs&quot; had occurred. The Justice Department later concluded that about $7.5 million had been improperly billed, although actual losses to the government were $3.2 million.    Prosecutors leapt on the case. Anxious to answer critics who were accusing it of doing a bad job prosecuting defense fraud cases, the Justice Department's special contract fraud unit began intensively reviewing literally millions of documents connected with the Divad program. Some of the department's best attorneys were assigned to the case, including Randy I. Bellows, the chief trial attorney, who had just completed a successful prosecution of Justice's biggest maritime insurance fraud case. In Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, with an impressive record prosecuting white-collar crime, joined the case.    The prosecutor's research turned up further evidence that appeared to support the Defense Department's initial findings. In one memo, a General Dynamics accounting officer warned Mr. Beggs that some work that was being charged to a research and development account &quot;should properly come under&quot; the Divad contract.    The investigators also uncovered evidence that General Dynamics's own accounting of the program was different from what was being reported to the government. On its internal accounts, the company showed a cost overrun on the Divad program, but its financial reports to the military showed the program was within its budget. In one instance, a senior General Dynamics billing clerk had attached a note to an internal budget document stating that the contract was going to run over budget &quot;and we cannot and do not want this to show on our progress payments&quot; from the military.    Armed with such evidence, the Justice Department persuaded a Los Angeles grand jury to return a seven-count indictment against General Dynamics and four of its executives. The indictment charged the defendants with one count of conspiracy to defraud the government and six counts of making false statements to the Defense Department.    By this time, the number of people involved in the case could have staffed a small corporation. In addition to the Justice Department fraud team, the investigation involved dozens of officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Naval Investigative Service, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Army Criminal Investigative Division.    Mr. Beggs's nightmare began in September 1985 when, without warning, two FBI agents walked into his executive office at NASA and handed him a letter informing him that he was the subject of the grand jury investigation. &quot;I was shocked,&quot; he says. &quot;I had never before in my life been involved in a legal proceeding.&quot; As time wore on, Mr. Beggs quit his job at NASA and took a course in the study of gems to help take his mind off the case. One of his five children, his daughter Kathleen, was a recent law school graduate and began working full time on the case to help clear her father's name.    In response to the government's charges, General Dynamics hired a crack team of lawyers, including former U.S. Attorney Thomas Sullivan of Chicago's Jenner andamp; Block and James G. Gallagher, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in defense-contact law. Mr. Beggs went to the law firm of Williams andamp; Connolly in Washington and hired Vincent Fuller, noted for his defense of would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley Jr.    The defense argued that the company's billing charges on the Divad program were within Defense Department regulations and that the prosecution had misunderstood an extremely complicated contract. Rather than proceed with a court trial, however, the defense team concocted a strategy that stunned many criminal lawyers.    It asked the federal district court judge hearing the case to invoke a legal principle called primary jurisdiction and to move the case from federal court to a Defense Department agency. The prosecution howled that such a ruling would effectively deprive the prosecution of its right to a trial of the criminal issues involved in the case.    Nevertheless, General Dynamics won a partial victory: Although Judge Ferdinand Fernandez refused to relinquish jurisdiction, he agreed to defer certain interpretations of the Divad contract to the military.    The resulting eight-month delay was devastating to the prosecution team -- much of which was dismantled by the Justice Department while awaiting resolution of the administrative issues. Randy Bellows, for instance, left to become an aide in the Iran-Contra investigation.    Meanwhile, the prosecution's case had already begun to unravel. In depositions, military procurement experts had begun disagreeing with each other over the nature of the Divad contract. Finally, the Justice Department found a top procurement official who was involved in the original writing of the contract. Edward Miller, assistant Army secretary for material acquisitions, told the investigators that the contract wasn't a &quot;fixed price&quot; agreement as had been asserted in the indictment. Instead, he said, the contract was a &quot;hybrid&quot; that combined features of a fixed price contract with something else called a &quot;best efforts&quot; contract.    The distinction made a huge difference. Although it was clearly against government regulations for General Dynamics to tap other government accounts in a fixed price contract, such a step was permissible in certain circumstances under the hybrid contract.    Mr. Miller's testimony meant that the prosecution had built its entire case on a fundamental misunderstanding. And even if it had other incriminating evidence -- such as the internal General Dynamics memos that raised questions of impropriety -- the defense could be expected to make the most out of the Justice Department's embarrassing predicament.    An internal Justice Department review led to a recommendation by nine out of the 10 lawyers involved that the case be dropped. When Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns was briefed about the decision, he reacted by saying, &quot;how horrible.&quot;    Assistant Attorney General William Weld later told a news conference that the case was dropped because the &quot;theory on which the indictment was based was factually wrong.&quot; He added, &quot;I'm very unhappy with the result.&quot;    Worried about offending its biggest customer, General Dynamics refrained from any substantive comment on the outcome of the case. Mr. Beggs, however, blasted the Justice Department. Among other things, he said that if the case hadn't been brought he would have been able to stay on as the top official of NASA, and would have been present at the launch of the space shuttle Challenger to render his own decision on whether to proceed despite the cold weather, which was cited as a factor in the explosion of the shuttle.    ---                        The Divad Case   January 1978 -- General Dynamics and Ford each get a $39million contract for a prototype of an anti-aircraft gun.
