But its employees are balking at the $43 million inproposed concessions, say representatives of the carrier'sfive unions, citing deep givebacks they've accepted in recentyears.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They've got to be kidding,&quot; said Brian Moreau, who headsthe International Union of Flight Attendants.   The stalemate could threaten the reorganization of Pan AmCorp., the once-powerful airline holding company that hasoperated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection sinceJanuary.   Late last week, Pan Am submitted to the federal bankruptcycourt a detailed account of its plan to start fresh as a new,smaller airline based in Miami. But that plan, which isscheduled to be confirmed on Dec. 3, is contingent upon PanAm's ability to first get fresh labor pacts from itsemployees, the airline said.   To that end, Pan Am's new president, Russell Ray, summonedlabor leaders to New York Friday. The meeting at the Pan AmBuilding, which the carrier intends to vacate on Nov. 30,started off quietly and cordially, but labor leaders becameangry and abruptly left the session when concessions werementioned.   Among components of the proposed give-back package is anagreement to subcontract union-covered work out to Delta AirLines Inc. Delta, which has agreed to purchase many Pan Amassets, will also own 45% of the new, reorganized Pan Am. PanAm management also is asking employees to accept wage freezesand cuts in health and severance benefits.   Given the nature of the carrier's ultimatum, union leadersmay find themselves powerless. If the airline is to survive,&quot;some of these are must items,&quot; concedes George Miranda, whorepresents Pan Am's International Brotherhood of Teamstersmembers. Moreover, union strength at Pan Am is diminishing,as many members and even some union leaders have joined theranks of Delta, as part of that carrier's purchase agreement.   Should the approximately 7,500 employees remaining withthe new Pan Am operation fail to reach contract agreements,it could be left to federal bankruptcy Judge CorneliusBlackshear to bring the sides together to assure that Pan Amsurvives.   Before the carrier emerges from bankruptcy, all five ofits unions must reach new agreements, and each agreement willrequire approval from Pan Am's unsecured creditors and fromDelta.   &quot;If they don't get new agreements, then there's not goingto be a new company,&quot; said a Pan Am spokesman.   The Air Line Pilots Association, the Flight EngineersInternational Association, and the Transport Workers Unionare all already working under expired contracts. TheInternational Union of Flight Attendants has a contract thatwas scheduled to remain in effect until next March, and theInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters has a contract thatwas to be effective until February 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
