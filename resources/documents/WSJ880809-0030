Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MIN PCS PET CMD </IN><TEXT>   Most corn, soybean and oat futures prices dropped their maximum daily limits in the wake of heavier-than-expected rains and forecasts for cooler temperatures and more rain.    While meteorologists are divided over the prospects for rain in the next few weeks, most had expected dry weather over the weekend. But a storm-blocking high pressure system didn't strengthen as much as expected, and sections of Iowa and Minnesota received as much as an inch of rain Sunday. The storm system is expected to travel across the central Corn Belt today, then weaken.    Private meteorologists said the unexpected rain doesn't signal a permanent break in the drought pattern. The jet stream, a pathway for storms, remains stalled over Canada, much farther north than usual. As a result, steady widespread rains over the Midwest are unlikely.    What's more, temperatures in the Midwest are expected to soar much above normal again by next week and put additional stress on crops. &quot;There isn't any sign of a drought breaker,&quot; said Joel Myers, president of Accu-Weather Inc., State College, Pa.    Nevertheless, the price of the soybean contract for November delivery fell 30 cents a bushel to settle at $8.59 a bushel. The corn contract for December delivery dropped 10 cents a bushel to settle at $3.045 a bushel. Wheat futures-prices slipped.    After the close of trading yesterday, the National Weather Service's six-to-10 day forecast called for normal rainfall over much of the Midwest next week, and below-normal precipitation over the southern plains states.    Analysts said futures prices fell sharply yesterday, in part because trading volume was light. Many investors are moving to the sidelines in anticipation of a report by the Agriculture Department on crop conditions, slated for release Thursday.    Traders expect the field survey to show sharp declines in the potential harvest of the corn and soybean crop. However, they are unsure whether the department will predict the level of damage seen by many private crop forecasters.    Several Midwest states reported after the close of trading yesterday that crop conditions continued to deteriorate during last week's heat wave. Illinois officials said 47% of the state's corn crop was in poor condition last Friday, compared with 42% July 29.    In Iowa, 10% of the soybean crop was in good shape Friday, compared with 23% July 29 and 57% a year earlier. While the condition of the Indiana corn crop stabilized somewhat last week, that state's soybean crop worsened.    The market shrugged off rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying roughly one million metric tons of soybean meal from South America. &quot;Everyone is preoccupied with the Thursday crop report,&quot; an analyst said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ENERGY: Oil prices soared on expectations that the end to the Iran-Iraq war would allow the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to put internal dissension to rest and renew efforts to cut back on oil production. As a result of the cease-fire, which will become effective Aug. 20, industry traders and brokers expect that Iraq will honor the quota it has flouted since 1986 and that other OPEC members will again comply with production limits. However, the oil-price increase of almost $1 -- in thin volume, during the past two trading days -- was seen as &quot;too much too fast,&quot; one trader said. &quot;There wasn't a lot of new buying during the afternoon,&quot; added Stephen Piasio, first vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international energy department. &quot;The price and pace of buying will likely ebb&quot; during the next few days.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell under the influence of a stronger dollar and weaker grain prices. Prices ended near their lows of the day, as they were hit by heavy selling toward the close. September delivery silver fell 17.50 cents an ounce to $6.7150, while December gold declined $1.80 to $440.80. October platinum was down $19.10 an ounce to $519.90. Conflicting reports on whether the Peruvian miners' strike would continue were a minor factor, according to analysts. According to a wire service report during the session, Peruvian miners were considering ending their three week-old strike. Peru's prime minister was quoted as asking the miners to end the strike and promising that they would get wage rises pegged at the inflation rate, as well as the right to retire at age 50. After trading ended, another report quoted a miners' spokesman as saying the strike would continue and that the government's promises on wage rises and retirement should be made law, analysts said.    COPPER: Futures prices slumped on selling prompted by rising supplies and slower seasonal demand. September delivery copper declined 2.20 cents a pound to 92 cents. In addition to the conflicting wire reports on whether Peruvian miners were about to end their strike, one analyst said the market moved more on the fact that supplies were outpacing consumption. John Gross, president of J.E. Gross andamp; Associates, Inc., New York-based metals industry consultants, cited American Bureau of Metal statistics figures showing that production from January through April rose 114,188 tons or 21% from a year earlier, to 655,441 tons. But U.S. consumption during the first four months of 1988 rose only 1.8% from the 1987 period, to 821,110 tons, he said. Of more immediate impact, Mr. Gross noted, London Metal Exchange stocks last week rose 725 tons to 120,700 tons. Warehouse stocks there had been expected to remain unchanged or to drop a little and the increase created some pressure on prices, he said. Copper inventories at both London Metal Exchange and New York's Commodity Exchange have been rising for some time, Mr. Gross said. As of Friday, he said, stocks at both exchanges combined amounted to 157,611 tons, compared with a total of 88,294 tons, a gain of 69,317 tons since the end of May. </TEXT></DOC>
