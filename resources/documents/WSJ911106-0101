But Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the SenateBanking Committee, expressed doubts that Congress wouldeventually adopt legislation that does much more thanreplenish the bank deposit insurance fund and tighten bankregulation. &quot;We're going to end up with a narrow bill&quot; thatis stripped of Bush administration proposals to allow banksinto the securities business and to expand insurance sales,the Utah senator predicted.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's not my choice; that's the political reality&quot;following Monday night's 324-89 House vote to defeat thebroad banking bill, Mr. Garn said.   The House Banking Committee plans to meet this morning toproduce a narrow bill that augments the bank depositinsurance fund, gives regulators new powers to imposecorrective measures -- such as dividend suspensions -- onweak banks, and seeks to end the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.'s ability to reimburse uninsured depositors starting in1995.   The House killed the sweeping bill after theadministration, the American Bankers Association and severallarge banks said it imposed too many restrictions on bankentry into the insurance and securities businesses. WhenRepublicans turned against the bill, Democrats refused totake responsibility for a bill that included a $70 billionrescue plan for the FDIC.   The Senate, which had hoped to start voting on a broadbanking bill this week, will probably postpone taking it upuntil next week so that negotiators can work with theTreasury and the banking, insurance and securities industriesto find a compromise that strengthens the chances of passage.&quot;I want to study the aftermath of the vote in the House,&quot;said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D.,Mich.).   In February, the Bush administration proposed acomprehensive bank-law modernization plan that recapitalizedthe bank insurance fund, tightened bank regulation, limiteddeposit insurance coverage, allowed banks to branchnationwide, expanded bank powers to enter the securities,insurance and mutual fund businesses, and allowed commercialand industrial firms to purchase banks. During the summer,banking committees in both the House and the Senate approvedbills that kept many of these proposals alive.   But the span of the proposals provoked a major turf fightamong the banking, insurance and securities industries thathelped kill the bill in the House. Yesterday, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady met with Senate Republicans in aneffort to try to keep the reform plans alive.   Treasury officials were working with members of the HouseBanking Committee in hopes of finding a way to revive ameasure that would allow banks to set up interstate branchingnetworks -- a move that could produce substantial costsavings for large, multistate holding companies, such asBankAmerica Corp., Citicorp and NCNB Corp.   Although House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez(D., Texas) wants to quickly send a bank insurance fundrecapitalization and bank regulation plan back to the House,he is likely to face pressure today to add branch banking tothe narrow bill.   The Senate Banking Committee endorsed its version of thebanking bill on a 12-9 vote, with both Democrats andRepublicans opposing the measure. Because the close,contentious vote gives the bill little momentum on the floor,Sen. Riegle and others would like to compromise on parts ofthe legislation in order to build support for the bill.Current negotiations focus on three areas -- securities,insurance and interstate branching.   Separately, the administration aggressively lobbiedmembers of the Senate Banking Committee to line up votes forthe confirmation of Robert Clarke for a second term asComptroller of the Currency. The panel will vote today. Inrecent days, President Bush himself has been campaigning forMr. Clarke, who faces significant opposition. Sen. Riegle hascharged Mr. Clarke, the chief regulator of national banks,with being too lax, while other senators claim that he hascontributed to the credit crunch by being too tough on banks.   ---   Greg Hitt contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
