Gorbachev today metwith East German leader Erich Honecker, a day after encouraging thehard-line government in East Berlin to work with ``all forces insociety.''   Gorbachev was in East Berlin during the country's 40thanniversary celebrations, which have been overshadowed by theexodus of nearly 50,000 refugees who fled to the West in search ofgreater freedom and opportunity.   In a brief dispatch, the state-run news agency ADN said the twoleaders had started their meeting but did not describe thesubstance of the talks.   In a formal address the night before, Gorbachev said: ``There isno doubt that the Socialist Unity Party (East German CommunistParty) has the intellectual potential, rich experience andpolitical authority to cooperate with all forces in society toanswer the questions placed on today's agenda.''   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper in West Germany said Fridaythat Gorbachev planned to encourage Honecker to make severalchanges, including easing travel restrictions for East Germans andallowing greater freedom of expression. Honecker has been unwillingto implement the economic and political reforms now under way inthe Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.   For the third straight day, East Germany today barred Westerntourists from entering Communist East Berlin, also erecting threebarriers at the crossing called Checkpoint Charlie by the Westernallies.   The 6-foot-tall barriers were set up overnight on the EastGerman side of the checkpoint. They apparently are designed to stopprotests similar to those Aug. 13, the anniversary of the start ofconstruction of the Berlin Wall, when demonstrators tried to liedown on the dividing line between the two sectors and hurledobjects at East German border police.   ``East Germany apparently fears that regime-critics coming fromWest Germany could disturb the 40th anniversary celebrations,''said West Germany's ARD television.   The Soviet leader, who was to return home later today, washailed by youths who shouted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as he stood besideHonecker during a three-hour Communist youth parade.   Many have said democratic change might stem the westward flow ofEast German youth and avoid divisions among the East bloc nations.   East Germany's leaders wanted the anniversary to portray theircountry as a socialist success.   ``All of our energy and loyalty to the German DemocraticRepublic,'' read one of the parade banners. But the exodus ofthousands of its citizens to the West from embassies inCzechoslovakia and Poland, and violent clashes between East Germansand police have focused world attention on the country's turmoil.   To squelch any possible protests during the anniversary, theCommunist leadership stepped up security nationwide.   Church sources today said police arrested eight members of thecountry's leading opposition group, New Forum.   Unconfirmed reports said the government was mounting barbed wirefences on the border with neighboring Poland and Czechoslovakia,which East German refugees used as stepping stones to the West.   West Germany's ZDF television said a caller from East Germanysaid Friday barbed wire was being strung along the frontier withCzechoslovakia. The newspaper Die Welt said East German authoritieswere preparing to build fences along the Polish border.   As anniversary festivities were about to begin in East GermanyFriday, a train carrying more than 600 disgruntled citizens rolledinto West Germany from Warsaw. The same number crossed into Austriafrom Hungary early today.   Thousands more traveled to the West earlier in the week aboardother trains after East Germany, in what seemed an attempt topolish its image, set free refuge-seekers camping at West Germanembassies in Prague and Warsaw.   In a formal address late Friday before the East Germanleadership, Gorbachev said the East German Communist Party canmanage the country's own affairs.   ``We have heard demands such as the U.S.S.R. should take downthe Berlin Wall and then people could believe in its (the Soviets')peaceful aims,'' said Gorbachev. ``Our Western partners shouldunderstand that questions regarding the GDR (East Germany) are notsolved in Moscow but in Berlin.''   But without being specific, Gorbachev also called on theauthoritarian leadership to reach out to all elements in society.   ``There is no doubt that (East Germany's Communist Party) hasthe intellectual potential, rich experience and political authorityto cooperate with all forces in society to answer the questionsplaced on today's agenda,'' he said.   The Soviet leader defended Moscow's reforms.   In his own address, Honecker, the 77-year-old East German leaderwho has run the country for more than 18 years, reaffirmed thecountry's hard line and condemned what he said were internationalefforts aimed at the ``destabilization of socialism.''</TEXT></DOC>
