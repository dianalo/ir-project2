($145), ForeCalc ($149), and TrendSetter Expert ($149) createforecasts based on data stored in 1-2-3 or Symphony worksheets.andP;  All threeprograms work with 1-2-3 Releases 2/2.01 and 2.2 or any release of Symphony.andO;Forecast! and ForeCalc also work with 1-2-3 Release 3.andP;  While none of theseprograms has the scope of a sophisticated statistical program, such as SPSSor ESP, each is suitable for many common business forecasting applications.andM;Choose Forecast! if you're familiar with forecasting techniques and knowwhich technique is best suited to a particular set of data.andP;  Thismacro-driven program offers the widest variety of forecasting techniques andis the only program of the three that can forecast more than one or twoseasonal cycles.andP;  If you're new to forecasting, Forecast!'s excellent manualcan teach you a lot about applying particular forecasting techniques.andP;  Butbeware: Forecasting is often more of an art than a science, and the manual'sexplanations, while clear, are in no way a substitute for experience.andM;ForeCalc, an add-in, attempts to provide some of that experience.andP;  Itautomatically selects one of three forecasting techniques, based on thepatterns it detects in your data.andP;  The program also gives you the option toselect and combine forecasting techniques on your own.andP;  ForeCalc is also agood choice if you're not well versed in statistics and if you need to runrepeated forecasts based on the same or slightly modified data.andP;  You canautomate the program with 1-2-3 or Symphony macros.andM;TrendSetter Expert is difficult to recommend for several reasons.andP;  Itincludes the fewest forecasting techniques of the three programs.andP;  While itsselection of forecasting techniques is entirely automatic, this ease-of-usestrategy can backfire on you.andP;  If, for example, the program selects atechnique that doesn't fit your data well, you can't try another that mightfit better.andP;  It's an add-in, but it also requires a 110Kterminate-and-stay-resident program that you can't load or unload withoutrestarting 1-2-3 or Symphony.andP;  And TrendSetter Expert ran as much as fourtimes slower than ForeCalc in my tests.andM;TechniquesandM;Business data--sales history, cash flow, profitability--can exhibit differentpatterns over time.andP;  However, in many cases these patterns aren't obviouseven to a trained eye.andP;  To generate a forecast based on this type of data,the three programs use a statistical technique called exponential smoothing.andM;Exponential smoothing uncovers underlying patterns by eliminating randomfluctuations in your data.andP;  This technique is suitable for making short-termforecasts.andP;  For example, from two years' worth of monthly sales data,exponential smoothing can create a useful forecast for the next six months.andO;The forecast becomes less useful if it is stretched over a longer period oftime.andM;Data can exhibit a distinct pattern over time.andP;  It can move in a straightline--that is, over time it can increase or decrease by the same absoluteamount.andP;  In forecasting parlance, this type of pattern is known as a lineartrend.andP;  If data increases or decreases by a constant percentage over time, itexhibits an exponential trend.andP;  If data rises quickly at first and thengradually achieves a constant level, it exhibits an S-curve trend.andP;  Themarket penetration of a product over time--that is, from its marketintroduction to its maturity--can often exhibit an S-curve trend.andM;If your data exhibits one of these trends, a technique called trend analysis,used either by itself or in combination with exponential smoothing, can yielda more useful forecast than exponential smoothing alone.andP;  Forecast! offerslinear, exponential, and S-curve trend analysis.andP;  ForeCalc and TrendSetterExpert automatically combine linear trend analysis with exponential smoothingwhenever they detect a linear trend in data.andP;  ForeCalc also combinesexponential trend analysis with exponential smoothing, but cannot detect anexponential trend.andP;  Neither ForeCalc nor TrendSetter Expert provides S-curvetrend analysis.andM;SeasonalityandM;Financial data often exhibits another kind of pattern, one that repeatsitself from week to week or year to year.andP;  This pattern, called seasonality,can be either multiplicative or additive.andP;  To understand the differencebetween the two, suppose that last year, while selling an average of 100units per month, you sold 120 units in March and 80 units in June.andP;  This yearyou're selling an average of 200 units per month.andP;  If you sell 240 units inMarch and 160 units in June, your data exhibits multiplicative seasonality.andO;If you sell 220 units in March and 180 units in June, your data exhibitsadditive seasonality.andM;Most financial data exhibits multiplicative seasonality.andP;  However, it'sbetter to apply additive seasonality to a forecast in certain situations.andO;For example, it's best to apply additive seasonality when your historicaldata contains negative values, as is sometimes the case in a cash flow orprofit statement.andM;All three programs can detect multiplicative seasonality in data and accountfor that seasonality in the forecasts.andP;  TrendSetter Expert does thisautomatically, ForeCalc can be set to do it automatically or at your option,and Forecast! does it at your option only.andP;  Of the three, only ForeCalc letsyou apply additive seasonality to a forecast.andM;Complex ApplicationsandM;Other factors besides trends and seasonality can determine the pattern ofdata, especially over the long term.andP;  For example, suppose you're a homebuilder who needs to forecast monthly sales over the next year.andP;  In additionto accounting for patterns in your past sales data, your forecast should alsoaccount for independent factors, or variables, such as changing interestrates or growth in the gross national product.andM;Of the three programs, only Forecast! offers forecasting techniques thataccount for these independent variables.andP;  One such technique, called multipleregression analysis, expands upon the regression command in 1-2-3 andSymphony by making it easier to experiment with different mathematicalexpressions that describe the relationship between the variables and thepattern of your data.andM;Another technique available only in Forecast!, called decomposition analysis,creates a forecast that accounts for projected business cycles as well astrends and seasonality.andP;  Long-range forecasts are especially vulnerable tobusiness cycles that run their course over several years.andP;  Decompositionanalysis is most useful if you already have a forecast business cycle,because a business cycle generally doesn't follow a pattern and is difficultto forecast from scratch.andM;TestingandM;You can test a forecasting technique by using it to forecast a latter portionof your data based on a former portion.andP;  The more closely your forecast datamatches your actual data, the more confidently you can use this technique toforecast the future.andP;  The three programs in this review use a tool called aconfidence interval to help you better interpret the result of such a test.andO;If the actual data falls outside the confidence interval, the technique maynot be good for forecasting future data.andM;As mentioned, TrendSetter Expert does not let you select and test alternativeforecasting techniques.andP;  This limitation is particularly disturbing becausein one of my tests TrendSetter Expert generated much smaller confidenceintervals than the other two programs, and the actual data fell well outsidethat confidence interval (figures 1 through 3).andM;In addition to confidence intervals, Forecast! and ForeCalc generate fourother statistics to gauge how well a forecasting technique fits your data:the standard forecast error, the Durbin-Watson statistic, the adjusted[R.sup.2] statistic, and the standardized Bayes Information Criterion (BIC).andO;Both program manuals explain what these statistics mean and how you can usethem to test your forecast.andM;Tom Carlton is manager of corporate business analysis at a midwestern Fortune500 company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
