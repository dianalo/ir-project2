CESAS is to extract systematically the event sequence, thatis sequential and causal relationship between occurrences, from the eventdescription written in natural language of English. This system is designedto be based on knowledge engineering technique utilized in the fieldof natural language treatment. The analytical process in this systemconsists of following three steps: (1) To analyze each sentence syntacticallyand semantically (2) To identify sentences, clauses or phrases representingoccurrences (3) To deduce the mutual relationship between occurrences.An existing syntactic analysis approach is applied to the above (1) step.As for (2) and (3) steps, a new analytical approach has been developed.In this paper, the outlines of CESAS and the newly developed approachare described and the analytical result is shown in comparison with amanually-extracted event sequence.</TEXT></DOC>
