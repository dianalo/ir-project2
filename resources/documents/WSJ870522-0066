Meanwhile, Tokyo and Frankfurt managed to shake off Wednesday's bearishness that stemmed from Citicorp's announcement that it would add $3 billion to its loanloss reserves.    Hong Kong issues were dragged down in thin trading by weakness in the stock of the British colony's major financial institution, Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. Stocks closed lower amid concern about the Latin American debt exposure of the company's Marine Midland Banks Inc. unit. The company's stock eased 20 Hong Kong cents to 8.2 Hong Kong dollars ($1.05).    London stocks closed just above the day's lows in quiet trading, with the 100-share index down 20.3 points at 2153.7, just half a point off the session's low. The Financial Times 30-share index was down 13.1 at 1677.7.    The 100-share index fell in response to the polls in the morning, rallied in the afternoon after the New York market opened strongly then dropped back to the day's worst levels toward the end of trading.    With the June 11 general looming, Britain has been deluged with polls, and generally they have given the ruling Conservative party a sizeable lead.    Results of three polls released yesterday morning, though, put the Conservative lead over the opposition Labor Party under 10 percentage points.    One of the polls gave the Tories a lead of just 3% over Labor and, in terms of parliamentary seats, suggested no single party would have a majority. The Conservatives' lead was the slimmest since the government called the general election.    Although the poll, conducted by Harris, is based on the smallest sample of the three, it surveys more than 1,000 people and renews one-quarter of the sample each day. Wednesday's poll gave the Conservatives a six-point lead over Labor.    With the large number of polls, dealers said they weren't surprised by signs of a narrowed gap. Still, the market grew cautious, they said.    &quot;We're looking for better news on the poll situation before we decide to go up again,&quot; one said.    Bank stocks remained under pressure in the wake of Citicorp's announcement. Lloyds Bank was down 20 pence at 523 pence ($8.80), Midland Bank was down 24 at 633, Barclays was off 16 at 543, and National Westminster Bank was off 12 at 673.    Mining issues had the worst losses amid profit-taking and a drop in the gold price during the day to a little less than $470 an ounce. Consolidated Gold Fields was down 29 pence at 11.10 pounds ($18.69), and RTZ was down 30 pence at 10.88 pounds.    Rolls-Royce partly paid shares were unchanged at 144 in the second day of trading. Volume eased to 157 million shares from more than 420 million Wednesday.    Several energy issues slid lower, with British Petroleum down 6 at 336, British Gas partly paid down 2 at 107, Britoil down 4.5 at 264.5, and Shell Transportation andamp; Trading down 19 pence at 12.76 pounds.    Tokyo issues soared in light to moderate trading amid bargain-hunting after a three-day plunge in Japanese stocks.    The Nikkei stock average, which plummeted 658.28 points Wednesday in its second largest single-day point fall, rose 334.41 to 23754.01. The first section index rose 18.43 to 2073.34. Turnover in the first section came to about 750 million shares, down from 820 million shares Wednesday. Gaining issues outnumbered losers 535 to 377, while 116 issues were unchanged.    The advance, traders said, represented an expected technical rebound following three consecutive losing days, when the Nikkei toppled 1656.62 points. The leading gauge of Japanese stocks had sunk amid slumps in Japanese government and U.S. Treasury bond prices, as well as a rise in gold prices and Citicorp's news. Meanwhile, bullishness toward domestic-spending led stocks had been undercut by suggestions that government spending to stimulate the domestic economy isn't as great as many investors hoped.    Brokerage issues rebounded from losses that stemmed from rumors the government is trying to cool securities and currency speculation. Nomura was up 100 yen at 5020 yen ($35.95), and Daiwa was up 30 to 3110.    Frankfurt stocks recovered in what brokers said was a technical reaction to Wednesday's steep drop.    Banking issues recovered some of the Citicorp-related slide, with Commerzbank up 8 marks to 253 marks ($142.62), Deutsche Bank up 4 at 583.5, and Dresdner Bank up 5.5 at 320.    Among auto makers, Daimler-Benz was up 15.5 at 976, and Bayerische Motoren Werke rose 8 to 567 after it said sales rose 11% to about 6 billion marks ($3.38 billion) in the first four-and-a-half months from 5.4 billion marks a year earlier. Volkswagen rose 10.5 to 357.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                            May 20     May 19       Year    U.S. ................... 259.4      260.6     + 13.8    Britain ................ 650.7      662.7     + 30.8    Canada ................. 409.6      414.7     + 22.9    Japan ................. 1238.5     1281.2     + 31.1    France ................. 428.9      441.5     +  5.1    Germany ................ 214.4      217.2     - 17.5    Hong Kong ............. 2049.3     2048.6     + 15.2    Switzerland ............ 177.3      180.4     - 11.7    Australia .............. 345.2      340.4     + 30.8    World index ............ 455.0      462.3     + 27.5</TEXT></DOC>
