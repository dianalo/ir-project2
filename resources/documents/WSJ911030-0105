The rules, carrying out the 1990 Clean Air Act, willrequire the nation's dirtiest power plants to cut theirsulfur-dioxide emissions in half by the turn of the centuryat a cost of $4 billion to $5 billion a year.</LP><TEXT>   Electric utilities are still studying how to handle a keyfeature of the law, setting up a new market-based tradingsystem for pollution credits, which are earned fordeeper-than-required cuts in acid-rain emissions. DavidSwanson, a vice president of Edison Electric Institute, amajor utility trade group, said utilities will need furtherdetails before deciding whether to hold or sell pollutioncredits, which by EPA estimates could be valued at $500 to$750 per ton of pollution.   In its proposal, EPA rejected attempts by the EnergyDepartment to allow more utilities to qualify for a specialclean-coal technology exemption that would give them fourextra years to meet their cleanup deadline. However, in adispute that won't be resolved until final rules are issuedin May 1992, environmentalists were dismayed that the EPAfailed to be stricter on utilities' monitoring of theirsmokestack pollution.   Overall, though, controversy has been held to a minimum,largely because the EPA held unusual advisory sessions withutilities, energy concerns, environmentalists and others indrafting the rules.   Utilities, which spew out 70% of the sulfur dioxide blamedfor acid rain and which fought off acid-rain laws for morethan a decade, still contend the costs for producers andconsumers will be higher than the EPA projects. The Edisoninstitute expects 10% to 15% rate increases in severalstates, and rate boosts over 20% at 10 particularly hard-hitutilities. EPA officials call those estimates excessive.   All sides, though, agree that costs are held down by thelaw's emphasis on allowing utilities to choose for themselveshow to cut their emissions.   By 1995, 110 of the dirtiest power plants must cut theirsulfur-dioxide emissions, either by switching to lower-sulfurcoal or installing smokestack scrubbing devices. Another 700plants will also be forced to clean up by the year 2000, whenregulators will freeze the amount of sulfur dioxide that canbe emitted by utilities to 8.9 million tons a year.   EPA Administrator William Reilly said the rules, whilethey don't eliminate sulfur-dioxide emissions, will helprestore lakes, streams and forests damaged by acid rainparticles in the U.S. and Canada, and will increasevisibility.   The EPA still must propose rules for controllingutilities' nitrogen-oxide emissions, which also are blamedfor acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
