RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Companies involved in treating hazardous wastetoday lost a Supreme Court appeal aimed at forcing the government toadopt tougher environmental rules.   The court, without comment, refused to let the firms sue forstricter standards that could increase their business volume or givethem a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment companies.   The justices, instead, let stand a ruling that denies thecompanies legal standing to sue in such cases.   The case prompted an unusual alliance between business andenvironmental groups.   The appeal by the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council, representingleading treatment firms and makers of advanced technology treatmentequipment, was supported by such prominent environmental groups asthe Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation andthe Natural Resources Defense Council.   The environmental groups, noting their own limited finances andtechnical capabilities, said they welcome legal standing forindustry groups wishing to fight, for whatever motive, for a cleanerenvironment.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled against thewaste-treatment companies last October.   The appeals court said the companies generally may not challengeas too lax the rules adopted by the federal Environmental ProtectionAgency for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste.   For example, the companies sought stricter deadlines andstandards for cement kilns used to burn liquid hazardous wastes.   The Hazardous Waste Treatment Council said lax EPA regulationsreduce the market for high-tech control devices that council membersmake and use. The council also said the rules permit the use ofwaste treatment facilities inadequate to protect the environment.   The appeals court said the council may not invoke federalenvironmental law to enlist the government's support for rules thatwould enhance company profits.   Also, the appeals court said, ``A firm has no common lawinterest, much less a constitutional one, in having government drivebusiness its way or in having government force competitors' servicesto be of the same quality (and cost) as its own.''   The appeals court also said permitting companies to sue in suchcases could have unintended consequences. For example, requiringmore advanced recycling techniques, ironically, could hurt theenvironment by prompting users to substitute more harmful fuels, theappeals court said.   It said the only time the waste-treatment companies may sue forstricter rules is to protect themselves as consumers _ when theypurchase recycled oil for their own use, for example.   The case is Hazardous Waste Treatment Council vs. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 88-1532.</TEXT></DOC>
