(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rally Monday on the Yale campus by agroup of students, alumni and faculty calling themselves ``YaliesAgainst Bush'' was disrupted by a spirited contingent of Bushbackers who swarmed around speakers who took turns attacking thevice president.   As students carrying Bush-Quayle signs worked their way to thefront of the crowd, supporters of Michael Dukakis responded inkind, crowding closer and closer to the speakers until they werecompletely surrounded.   Yale police attempted in vain to get the competing camps to pullback.   About 200 people attended the rally, and the proximity of thecrowd to the speakers made it difficult to hear the speeches fromany distance.   The Bush supporters occasionally heckled but did not preventmembers of ``Yalies Against Bush,'' or John Dukakis, the Democraticpresidential candidate's son, from delivering their speeches.   When speakers finished their remarks and ``Yalies Against Bush''responded with ``Go Duke'' and other chants, the Bush supporters,some of whom remained at the back of the crowd, yelled ``Four moreyears.''</TEXT></DOC>
