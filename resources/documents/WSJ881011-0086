Though the Nasdaq Composite Index of 4,500 OTC stocks retreated for the first time in four trading sessions -- closing at 385.49, down 0.18 -- some brokerage firms said they enjoyed increased retail buying from individual investors. Part of the reason: Brokers on the holiday were able to reach potential customers at home, rather than the office, and convince them to buy stocks.    When investors are at home, &quot;there could be a little bit more time, and there could be a little more willingness&quot; to listen to a broker, said Mitch Meisler, director of marketing for Shearson Lehman Hutton's huge OTC department. Perhaps more important, said Mr. Meisler, Friday's Wall Street rally helped set a better tone to the market.    Super Rite Foods led the advancers' list by soaring 5 to 22 1/4 after the Harrisburg, Pa., food distributor said a management group will make a takeover proposal. Rite Aid Corp. said it would tender its 46.8% stake in Super Rite.    Some 96.8 million shares traded on Nasdaq, 37% off Friday's active pace but a bit busier than many recent Mondays.    Regional bank stocks and savings-and-loans that are popular with small investors came back to life, including Crestar Financial, up 3/8 to 25 1/8, and Indiana National, up 1/2 to 29, both in light trading. Among thrifts, Bay View Federal Savings andamp; Loan added 1 to 19 3/8; Benjamin Franklin Savings andamp; Loan added 1/4 to 5 5/8; Charter One Financial gained 1/4 to 9 7/8.    But Nasdaq's backbone, its big technology stocks, continued to drag the composite index down, stung by a series of disappointing earnings reports and analysts' outlooks. Apple Computer, which was spared Friday's technology-stock carnage, fell 1 1/4 to 38 1/2 on a Nasdaq-leading 2.9 million shares.    Intel, languishing at an eight-month low, fell another 1/8 to 24 3/4, while Lotus Development declined 7/8 to 15 7/8; Sun Microsystems slipped 3/8 to 29 5/8, and Microsoft was off 1/2 to 49 1/4.    Luring investors back to the market has obsessed traders. One solution comes from Patrick C. Ryan, manager of OTC trading at Johnston, Lemon andamp; Co., Washington, D.C.    Mr. Ryan's company has been trying to lure investors by emphasizing stocks in local, highly visible companies. For example, he said the company has had success in selling Citizens Bancorp of Maryland, which rose 1/2 to 26, and Hechinger Class A, which added 1/4 to 17 1/2. Citizens is a local bank holding company while Hechinger, based in Landover, Md., runs a chain of home-center stores.    &quot;The corporate identification is there,&quot; which makes it easier to get to first base with a potential investor, said Mr. Ryan.    Among other stocks, Service Merchandise rose 1 7/8 to 15 3/8, apparently on news of a $27.50-a-share buy-out offer for Best Products, another catalog and showroom merchandiser. A management group considered a Service buy-out last month, but withdrew.    Chandler Insurance rose 1 to 8 1/4 after the company was mentioned in Barron's as one of Somerset Asset Management's seven stock picks.    Werner Enterprises surged 1 1/2 to 18 1/2 after Alex. Brown andamp; Sons raised its earnings estimates for the trucking company, Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.    ---   &quot;TOP TRADERS&quot; UPDATE: How did OTC Review determine the top 10 over-the-counter traders at full-service, regional and wholesale brokerage firms, as rated by peers? That's what several callers wanted to know after this column printed the magazine's second annual survey.    Some smaller firms perceived preferential treatment for big firms that advertise in OTC Review. Others wondered just who did the voting.    OTC Review officials deny any advertising tie, noting for example that advertisers William Blair andamp; Co. and Burns, Pauli andamp; Co. were bumped off the regional list this year. Also, Troster Singer Corp. is &quot;not friendly with us,&quot; but showed up No. 2 on the wholesale list anyway, said OTC Review Editor Robert J. Flaherty.    But the magazine concedes the survey is highly subjective.    Publisher John H.W. Rhein III sent out 150 questionnaires and received back about a third. One was sent to each firm that he determined &quot;counts in the business.&quot; He picked these firms by judging how &quot;visible&quot; they are in Securities Traders' Monthly magazine.    Mr. Rhein, while defending the survey as &quot;accurate,&quot; said he had to limit who would be queried. &quot;The survey could become terribly cumbersome if you allow it to become a comprehensive study of the entire industry,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
