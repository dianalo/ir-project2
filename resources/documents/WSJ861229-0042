We all have to be joyous for Aurel Cornea, the French hostage released by Lebanese kidnappers after 202 days in captivity. In another way, though, the Yuletide release mocks peace on earth. The same kidnappers retain at least one other Frenchman and two Americans. Christmas letters were delivered from three Frenchmen held by another faction, also thought to hold two other Americans.    An airline hijacking, meanwhile, added to turmoil in the Middle East, as an Iraqi jetliner crashed in Saudi Arabia. More than 60 of the approximately 100 people on board were killed as the plane burst into flames on a small desert runway after explosions and gunfire as hijackers fought security men.    Iran denies that it was behind the hijacking, but its war with Iraq drags on. Young men on both sides just died over some islands in the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The war has already lasted for more than six years; estimates of casualties range from 300,000 to more than one million.    Meanwhile, in Moscow, a leading Kremlin foreign-policy adviser to Mikhail Gorbachev chose to offer soothing words about Afghanistan to the Washington Post's Gary Lee. On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the Soviet invasion, Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Soviet Union's International Institute for World Economics, said the Soviet Union plans to withdraw its troops from combat in Afghanistan even if the current efforts at a &quot;political solution&quot; fail. He said &quot;there will be a withdrawal in any case,&quot; and that the Afghan freedom fighters are &quot;welcome&quot; to return and &quot;help the existing government.&quot; But he cautioned that any Soviet troop withdrawal would take place only after &quot;a longer period required to stabilize the situation.&quot;    Christmas is of course observed by Christians, but nearly all of the world's religions have similar celebrations of hope and joy, similarly confounded by the persistence of turmoil and evil in the world. </TEXT></DOC>
