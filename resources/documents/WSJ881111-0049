But it said orders for its custom-integrated circuits have slowed in recent weeks.    Carmelo J. Santoro, chairman, said net income for the quarter was $3.9 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $1.5 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue jumped 47%, to $35.4 million, from $24.1 million. He attributed the increase in earnings to the flurry of new orders, which set quarterly and annual records for the company, which designs and produces custom-integrated circuits.    For the full year, Silicon Systems net more than quadrupled to $12.7 million, or $1.67 a share, compared with $2.8 million, or 41 cents a share, in fiscal 1987. Revenue for the year rose 48%, to $120.8 million from $81.8 million last year.    The outlook for Silicon Systems' fiscal first quarter is less bright because of the cyclical nature of its business, a company spokesman said. First-quarter revenue should exceed that of the previous year's quarter, he said, but may be as much as 15% lower than fourth-quarter sales. The company didn't estimate what effect the decline in revenue might have on first-quarter earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
