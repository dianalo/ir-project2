(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inmates angry over heat and crowdedconditions set fire to a county jail Sunday, destroying one wing ofthe pre-Civil War building. At least eight people were injured.   Prisoners at the Essex County Jail and House of Correctionpelted firefighters and police with cans and debris as flamespoured through the roof of the jail during the three-hour uprising.   Two prisoners tried to escape but were caught before leaving thegrounds, authorities said.   ``Cops got hit, firefighters got hit,'' Lawrence fire Lt. JamesCampbell said. ``They threw pipes _ long pipes, I don't know wherethey got them from _ bricks, bottles.''   About 100 prisoners were moved from the destroyed east wing ofthe 144-year-old jail to an outdoor recreation area, where sometried to climb fences before they were contained by a phalanx ofriot police, authorities said. Tear gas was used to subdue theinmates, authorities said.   Essex County Special Sheriff Harry Coppola said 250 inmates werebeing housed at the jail, about twice its official capacity. Thejail is not air-conditioned, and temperatures in the Boston areaSunday climbed into the 90s.   About noon, a group of inmates set a small fire in the gymnasiumthat was quickly extinguished.   But about 1 p.m., a second fire broke out that raged for 1{hours, destroying a shingled roof over the east wing of thecross-shaped, three-story granite building.   At least eight people were injured, including five inmates andone firefighter who were taken to Lawrence General Hospital and BonSecours Hospital in Methuen, authorities said. Hospital officialssaid they were being treated for smoke inhalation and cuts.   The jail predominantly houses prisoners convicted ofmisdemeanors with maximum terms of up to 2{ years, officials said.Among the inmates were 31 federal prisoners awaiting trial who arekept in the facility under contract with the federal government,Coppola said.   Inside the jail yard, about 20 inmates, many clad only inshorts, chanted ``food'' and ``unfair treatment'' to about 500spectators who filled a park adjacent to the jail in this city of60,000 located 30 miles north of Boston.   State police Trooper Charles McPhail said inmate visitationrights recently had been revoked because of unspecified problems,which may also have been a cause for the uprising.   About 300 police and firefighters from at least eight cities andtowns were called to the disturbance. The police entourage numberedmore than 200 state, county and local officers, including twosquads of helmeted riot police, authorities said.   During the blaze in the gymnasium, which was set with paper andother debris, inmates watching from their cells pelted firefighterswith cans and squirted them with shaving cream, Campbell said.   About 100 firefighters were dispatched to the jail to fight thesecond, larger fire. Riot police were called in after firefightingefforts were hampered by the hail of debris, and the blaze wasunder control about 2:30 p.m, officials said.   About 35 of the jail's 127 cells were destroyed and virtuallyall the others suffered smoke and water damage or other damage,officials said.   Michael Fair, head of the state's Department of Correction, saidhis agency was looking for a place to house 110 to 140 inmatesdisplaced by the fire. The fire ``certainly puts a tremendousstrain on an already overcrowded system,'' Fair said.   The state is planning a new facility in nearby Middleton toreplace the Lawrence jail, said state Human Services SecretaryPhilip Johnston, the state's top prison official.   The Lawrence prison, he added, ``is one of the oldest in thecountry, and it's a very bad facility. That's the reason we shouldget this going as quickly as possible.''   Prison overcrowding has been a chronic problem in Massachusettsat state and county facilities. Legislation giving the statecontrol of county facilities has been stalled in the stateLegislature for at least two years.</TEXT></DOC>
