South American nations tend to view one another with suspicion, seek commerce elsewhere, and leave their frontiers as wildernesses.    Vacuous trade associations abound, but the countries shun trade with one another. Little more than 10% of Brazil's trade is with the 10-member Latin American Integration Association, which includes six of its neighbors -- Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Paraguay and Venezuela.    A communique spoke last month of the &quot;permanent friendship&quot; between Brazil and Venezuela. But at this border post, the results of mutual disregard are clear. Although some maps say the &quot;Panamerican Highway&quot; crosses the border here, it is no highway, just a pot-holed dirt track. On the Venezuelan side, a wooden barrier blocks the track. Beside it, there's an abandoned tractor, a crumbling shack, six heavily armed soldiers and two diseased dogs.    There's also a poster of a soldier clasping a submachine gun: &quot;Bienvenido a Venezuela&quot; -- &quot;Welcome to Venezuela,&quot; it says.    That's the sort of welcome you get. Venezuelan soldiers interrogate you, make exhaustive entries in ledgers, and strew clothes across a grimy counter. Procedures take two hours or more. On a wall, the soldiers' motto is scrawled: &quot;Work, Work, Work and MORE WORK.&quot;    Getting across the border is an obstacle course few attempt. &quot;We had a judge cross the border yesterday,&quot; growls Francisco Elbo Alves, a Brazilian police officer. &quot;The Venezuelans opened his wife's case and threw her underwear all over the place. You think that's a way to improve relations?&quot;    Well, probably not. Things are poisonous at the sole official crossing point on the 1,379-mile Brazil-Venezuela frontier. Mr. Alves sends back a Venezuelan woman. &quot;They're getting tougher on the other side, so we're going to get tough,&quot; he says.    Border problems are now being discussed at a high level. Last month, a &quot;consular cooperation group&quot; was set up to accelerate border procedures, and a decision taken to pave the road linking the nearest towns on each side of the border. But ominously, a communique said this was only intended to cement &quot;the excellent atmosphere&quot; at the border. </TEXT></DOC>
