The fine against Stuart-James Co., Denver, is the largestever imposed on a member firm by the National Association ofSecurities Dealers, the self-regulatory body for theover-the-counter stock market. Also fined were Stuart-James'spresident, its head trader and a former chairman.</LP><TEXT>   The case, which the firm settled without admitting ordenying wrongdoing, comes amid growing pressure in Washingtonfor a crackdown on penny-stock frauds. The NASD said thatStuart-James marked up four low-priced stocks between 6.9%and 153% in selling them to investors.   Sarah Ackerson, chief of a Securities and ExchangeCommission unit set up to curb market manipulation, calledthe settlement a &quot;significant step&quot; in cracking down onpenny-stock fraud and in protecting investors from excessivemarkups. The settlement doesn't affect a continuing SECinvestigation of Stuart-James and its top officials, saidRobert Davenport, the SEC's regional administrator in Denver.   In settling with the NASD, Stuart-James agreed to severalremedial actions. According to the settlement, the firm will:   -- Not trade or underwrite so-called &quot;blind pool&quot; or&quot;blank check&quot; companies.   -- Send written notice to customers of the highest bid andlowest asked prices for stocks when they are traded.   -- Seek other independent dealers in underwritingsecurities.   -- Undergo surveillance of its markup practices by anindependent consultant.   One surprising part of the settlement was the disclosurethat as of last Jan. 1, Stuart-James quietly stopped makingmarkets in penny stocks that aren't traded on the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.It is still making markets in stocks on Nasdaq (these stocksare required to meet certain financial criteria).   An attorney for Stuart-James said the lost business isn'tsignificant for the firm, which he said represented only 3%of its revenue before Jan. 1.   Stuart-James attorney Peter Gadkowski conceded theregulatory scrutiny of penny-stock trading has hurt thebrokerage firm's business. The firm now has 1,000 brokers and40 branch offices, down from 1,350 brokers and 47 branchoffices two years ago, Mr. Gadkowski said. Penny stocks arethose issues generally priced under $1 a share.   However, he said in the past few years Stuart-James hasmoved to &quot;upgrade the nature of the (initial public)offerings we're doing from start-up situations to companiesmore seasoned and in need of mezzanine financing.&quot;   Mr. Gadkowski also contended that Stuart-James stoppedmaking markets in penny stocks not listed on Nasdaq becauseof a new SEC regulation cracking down on &quot;cold calls&quot; tofirst-time investors, not because of the settlement talkswith NASD, which began last fall.   But John Pinto, NASD vice president of compliance,disagreed with that interpretation. &quot;Their agreement with usis far broader&quot; than the regulation of first-time customers,said Mr. Pinto. &quot;You could be a customer for five yearsdealing with non-Nasdaq stocks,&quot; and no longer be able totrade through Stuart-James, he explained. &quot;They're out ofthat business.&quot;   The action taken against the brokerage firm's topofficials included: a $105,000 fine against James Padgett,president and sole shareholder; a $25,000 fine against StuartGraff, former chairman; and a $30,000 fine against StevenPata, head trader.   Mr. Padgett also cannot act as a supervisor over themarkup area for six months. Mr. Graff was suspended fromacting as a principal for 60 days. Mr. Pata was suspended inall capacities for 20 days.   Mr. Padgett referred calls to the attorney, Mr. Gadkowski.Messrs. Graff and Pata couldn't be reached for commentyesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
