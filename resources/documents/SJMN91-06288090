It could not be independently verified.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MUSLIM GROUP CLAIMS IT SEIZED ISRAELI SOLDIER  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     In the past, Shiite Muslim groups have always included a photograph of akidnapping victim to verify their written statements. No such photograph orwritten statement was delivered this time.;   In Jerusalem, an army spokesmansaid, &quot;We don't have any information indicating this is true. We are checkingthe report.&quot;;   Shiite Muslim groups have repeatedly demanded that Israel free300 prisoners it holds in southern Lebanon and Israel before Westerners heldhostage in Lebanon can go free. Other groups have demanded the release of8,500 Palestinians held in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.;  Israel has balked at releasing more Arab prisoners until it obtainsinformation about the fate of five Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon. Onlyone of them is believed alive.;   The first Arabic-speaking caller identifiedthe alleged kidnap victim as Yaacov Samir Yizhai and said details of how andwhere he was abducted would be revealed in later communiques.;   The callerwarned Israeli authorities that any attempt to seek out the soldier &quot;wouldreflect adversely on the safety of the prisoner.&quot;;   &quot;The motive behind hiscapture is to trade him for a number of the mujahedeen (holy warriors) held inthe enemy's jails. We shall later specify their number,&quot; the caller said andhung up.;   The caller said in introducing himself that the statement wasissued by Hezbollah-Palestine, formerly Hezbollah-Jerusalem.;   After therelease of British hostage John McCarthy in August, a group calling itselfHezbollah-Palestine said it was holding an Israeli prisoner, but the claim wasnever confirmed. It said then that factions holding Western hostages shouldrefrain from trading them until its own brethren were released.;  Hezbollah-Jerusalem had claimed responsibility for several rocket attacksearlier this year on an Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon. The namechange could reflect a split in the group, or a whim on the part of thecaller.;   Both names seem to indicate a connection to the Iranian-backedHezbollah, which is believed to be the umbrella group for the factions holdingmost of the nine Westerners missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage.;  The second caller said the Israeli was being held at one of the group's basesand also warned against any rescue attempt. He said the names of the Arabs thegroup wants released would be announced later.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Beirut, Lebanon  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911014  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  437  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 14, 199100288090,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
