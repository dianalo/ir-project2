Consolidated Rail Corp., Philadelphia, said net fell 44% to $48 million, or 69 cents a share, from $86 million, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.5% to $831 million from $788 million.    The recent quarter included a $1 million gain from real-estate sales, while the year-ago quarter included a $17 million gain from real estate. The year-earlier quarter also benefited because the company didn't incur federal income tax expenses because of net operating loss carry-forwards.    L. Stanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive officer, said that without the higher real-estate-sales gains and other factors, quarter earnings would have been &quot;comparable&quot; to year-ago results.    Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. net more than doubled to $1.64 million, or 15 cents a share, from $713,000, or seven cents a share, a year ago. The previous-year quarter would have been $8.6 million, or 89 cents a share, but for a 72-cent-a-share loss from discontinued operations and a 10-cent-a-share loss from early retirement of debentures. Revenue grew 3.2% to $122.9 million from $119.1 million.    The Kansas City, Mo., concern said the recent quarter was hurt by a $5.3 million, or 52-cent-a-share, pretax charge related to buying shares at an above-market price from Carol Management Group. Without the charge, quarter earnings would have been 67 cents a share. The company said it was also hurt by legal and consulting expenses relating to a lawsuit.    Union Pacific Corp.'s quarter net grew 13% to a record $138 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $122 million, or $1.07 a share, a year ago. Revenue at the New York firm increased 9.9% to $1.57 billion from $1.43 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Consolidated Rail closed at $29.50 a share, down 50 cents, Kansas City Southern closed at $34.625 a share, down 50 cents, and Union Pacific closed at $65, down 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
