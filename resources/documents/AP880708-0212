LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Partial results from Mexico's presidentialelection show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party winning,but with the lowest margin in its six decades of rule, sources saidFriday.   The figures from the Federal Electoral Commission, which areliable source gave The Associated Press, show presidentialcandidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari ahead with 47.4 percent of thepopular vote.   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist coalition National DemocraticFront was second with 26.7 percent, and Manuel J. Clouthier of theconservative National Action Party third with 20.7 percent.   The count is for 11.7 million of the 38 million registeredvoters, or 30.7 percent.   In addition to the presidency, 64 Senate seats and 500 in thenewly expanded Chamber of Deputies also are at stake.   The Federal Electoral Commission, which controls the vote count,released fragmentary, unofficial results early Thursday, one dayafter the nationwide elections. It said final results were notexpected until Sunday.   The leak of a vote count appeared to be made to deflect growingspeculation that the ruling party, known as the PRI, had suffered adevastating loss.   No presidential candidate since the PRI's inception in 1929 haswon with less than 70 percent of the vote.   The slow vote count also is making evident splits within theparty between the 40-year-old Salinas de Gortari and his closestassociates, known as technocrats, and the old-style politicians.   The Federal Electoral Commission is headed by Interior SecretaryManuel Bartlett, who was one of Salinas de Gortari's chief rivalsfor the PRI's presidential nomination.   Salinas de Gortari has insisted throughout the campaign that anew era of modern Mexico will be recognized in which oppositionvoices will be heard.   In issuing his proclamation of victory Thursday, Salinas deGortari said: ``It is the new political reality of the nation, andwith which we will have to coexist in a harmonious and respectfulfashion.''   The commission has warned candidates against claiming victorybefore the final tally is in.   ``No official preliminary results have been issued on thepresidential election. Consequently, claims by candidates andparties are not based on any official information,'' the commissionsaid in a brief statement Thursday night.   Bartlett first said technical difficulties with a new computersystem delayed the returns. He later blamed bad weather.   The government says the elections were peaceful and clean. PRIofficials have said charges by opposition parties that theballoting was fraudulent was simply a publicity-seeking move.   ``The Mexican political system is corrupt and lackscredibility,'' Clouthier said in announcing a protest marchSaturday afternoon in downtown Mexico City.   ``As sure as I am that I did not win the presidency, I canaffirm the electoral process was not clean,'' Gumersindo Magana,candidate of the small, conservative Mexican Democratic Party, wasquoted as saying Friday by the government newspaper El Nacional.   Political analyst Jorge Castaneda said Cardenas, who split awayfrom the PRI and ran as the candidate of the leftist coalitionNational Democratic Front, apparently did well in urban areas.   The question is ``whether the votes that come in from thecountryside will be enough to compensate for the Cardenas lead inurban Mexico,'' Castaneda said.   He defined urban as any town of at least 5,000 people,accounting for two-thirds of the 38 million registered voters.   Cardenas, Clouthier and presidential candidate Rosario Ibarra dePiedra of the tiny, radical Revolutionary Workers Party met withfederal officials Wednesday night and issued a statement accusingthe government of massive fraud.   Magana did not sign the statement but also accused thegovernment of fraud.   The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a civic watchdog group,recorded 1,100 cases of voting irregularities ranging fromballot-stuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls.   Fourteen complaints were filed with the attorney general'soffice, including falsification of electoral documents to thedisappearance of 11,000 ballots in Mexico City's 27th ElectoralDistrict and thousands more in western Michoacan state.   The PRI has controlled the presidency, congress andgubernatorial offices in all of Mexico's 31 states since itsfounding in 1929.   While claiming victory, Salinas de Gortari called the campaign``one of the most contested elections in our history and one of themost peaceful.''   He seemed to be preparing the party for what could be a pivotalmoment in PRI history _ less than overwhelming victory at alllevels.   ``The era of practically one party ends and we enter now in anew political stage in the life of the country,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
