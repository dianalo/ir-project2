Discloses'Unauthorized' MovesCaused $984,000 Loss</HL><DD> 01/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GETEE </IN><DATELINE> AMITYVILLE, N.Y.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Geotel Inc. said an investigation revealed that it sustained a loss of $984,000 as a result of &quot;unauthorized transactions&quot; by its former treasurer.    The company, a maker of video broadcast equipment, photo instruments and software, said its insurance will cover about $100,000 of the losses. Geotel also estimates that it can also recover about $250,000 in taxes paid in prior years.    The net loss of about $650,000 after the recoveries won't affect the company's current activity, the company said, but will affect its expansion and acquisition plans for the future &quot;to some extent.&quot;    The company said it became aware in early December of unauthorized transactions in its checking, loan and brokerage accounts. After it was determined that the treasurer was responsible, he was &quot;immediately terminated,&quot; the company said. A subsequent investigation conducted by Laventhol andamp; Horwath, the company's accounting firm, determined the extent of the losses.    A company spokesman said that &quot;investigations are taking place&quot; into the activities of the former treasurer, who couldn't be reached to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
