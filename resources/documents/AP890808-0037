(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire closed a section of one of thenation's busiest highway interchanges and officials tried topersuade motorists to take mass transit instead of their vehiclesto work.   ``The rest of the week is going to be a disaster,'' said DebbieLawler, spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. ``It'sgoing to take a while for people to find the best alternative routefor them, and it's going to take a while for them to be convincedto take mass transit.''   The fire that closed Interstate 78 started at about 1:30 a.m.Monday at a garbage dump owned by Hub Recycling Co. underneath the12-lane, elevated roadway, buckling steel beams. Late Monday, thefire was contained but continued to smolder.   A 1\-mile portion of the 62.2-mile roadway, which handles about100,000 vehicles a day, will probably be closed for months,authorities said.   Alternate routes linking the busy New York metropolitan areawith New Jersey suburbs and parts of Pennsylvania are limited. NewJersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean said a special panel has been convenedto study other routes.   Kean said the state was preparing to go to court to press for acleanup of the site. A Superior Court clerk said a hearing could beheld today.   The state has been trying for two years to get the court toforce Hub Recycling to remove rubbish stored under the interstate.An Essex judge last May ordered the removal of the garbage butstayed the decision on appeal from the company.   Two of Hub Recycling's owners, Michael Harvan and Richard Bassi,were convicted recently of illegal waste handling in North Bergen,the state said.   Harvan, of Clifton, and Bassi, of Morristown, were partners inBig M Trucking Co. of Clifton, which authorities said took part ina conspiracy to dump thousands of tons of construction debris atseveral North Bergen sites.   Attempts to reach the two men were unsuccessful Monday. Theirhome telephone numbers could not be obtained.   Their lawyer, Richard Roberts of Orange, did not respond tomessages left with his office.   No injuries were reported in the blaze, which occurred about twomiles from downtown Newark.Officials were uncertain how the firestarted.   Some businesses in the area evacuated workers when smoke pouredthrough cracks of up to eight inches in the highway. Environmentalofficials tested for toxic materials in the plume.   Peter Baish, area director of the U.S. Customs Service office inNewark, said he evacuated his workers about midday after smokefilled several floors housing his agency.   He said some workers were coughing and complained of eyeirritations.   The Associated Press also closed its Newark office, and movedoperations to its Trenton bureau as a precaution, said New JerseyChief of Bureau Jerry Gray.</TEXT></DOC>
