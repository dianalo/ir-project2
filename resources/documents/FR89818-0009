Background </ITAG>The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 enacts into law the recommendations ofthe Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians establishedby Congress in 1980 (Pub. L. 96-317). This bipartisan Commission was establishedto review the facts and circumstances surrounding Executive Order 9066,issued February 19, 1942, and the impact of that Executive Order on Americancitizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry; to reviewdirectives of United States military forces requiring the relocation, andin some cases, detention in internment camps of these American citizensand permanent resident aliens; and to recommend appropriate remedies. TheCommission submitted to Congress in February, 1983, a unanimous report,<T3>Personal Justice Denied, </T3>which extensively reviewed the historyand circumstances of the decisions to exclude, remove and then to detainJapanese Americans and Japanese resident aliens from the West Coast, aswell as the treatment of the Aleuts during World War II. The final partof the Commission's report, <T3>Personal Justice Denied Part 2: Recommendations, </T3>concluded thatthese events were influenced by racial prejudice, war hysteria, and a failureof political leadership, and recommended remedial action to be taken bythe Congress and the President. On August 10, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil LibertiesAct of 1988 into law. The purposes of the Act are to acknowledge and apologizefor the fundamental injustice of the evacuation, relocation, and internmentof Japanese Americans and permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry,to make restitution, and to fund a public education program to preventthe recurrence of any similar event in the future. Section 105 of the Act assigned the Attorney General the responsibilityand duties for the restitution provisions. The Attorney General delegatedthe responsibilities and duties assigned him by the Act to the AssistantAttorney General for Civil Rights, who, in turn, established the Officeof Redress Administration in the Civil Rights Division to carry out theexecution of the responsibilities and duties under the Act. The Office of Redress Administration (ORA) is charged with the responsibilityof identifying and locating persons eligible under the Act, without requiringany application for payment, within twelve months after the date of enactmentof the Act (August 10, 1988), or within twelve months after the appropriationof funds necessary to complete the identification process. To date no appropriationshave been made. It was estimated by the Commission on Wartime Relocationand Internment of Civilians that approximately 120,000 American citizensand permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry were affected by theexclusion. Of these, an estimated 60,000 individuals survive and are eligiblefor redress payment. In its efforts to identify and locate these individuals, the Office ofRedress Administration has initiated a highly publicized outreach programto the Japanese American community to encourage those persons thought tobe eligible to notify the Office with information concerning their eligibilityand current residences. On September 19, 1988, the Office of Redress Administrationannounced the establishment of a toll free telephone number and a U.S.Post Office Box designed to accommodate individuals wishing to ask questionsor volunteer information concerning their eligibility. This announcementalso was publicized in Japanese American newspapers. The Office also placedits West Coast staff in San Francisco, California, for ninety days in orderto establish close working relationships with the leaders of Japanese Americanorganizations to ensure that the Office would reach as many eligible personsas possible. Section 105 of the Act also requires the Attorney General to notify eacheligible individual in writing as to a determination of eligibility, andto authorize the payment of $20,000 to each eligible individual. Paymentwill be made in the order of the date of birth pursuant to Section 105(b).Therefore, when funds are appropriated, payment will be made to the oldesteligible individual living on the date of the enactment of the Act, August10, 1988 (or his or her statutory heirs), who has been located by the Administratorat that time. Payments will continue to be made until all eligible personshave received payment. For this purpose, the Act specifies that a totalof $1,250,000,000 is to be placed in the United States Civil LibertiesPublic Education Fund from which payments may be made. Because the Actspecifies that no more than $500,000,000 may be appropriated in any oneyear, not all payments can be made at one time. During the period of drafting the proposed regulations, many individualsand organizations in the Japanese American community contacted the CivilRights Division to ask questions and express concern regarding the determinationof eligibility. In response to these concerns the Division published aNotice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 53 FR 41252 (October 20, 1988), inviting thepublic to submit comments during the proposed regulation's drafting periodon three issues that seemed to be of major concern to the public. Theseissues pertained to the eligibility of minors who were relocated to Japanbetween December 7, 1941 and September 2, 1945, persons of Japanese ancestrysent to the United States from other American republics during World WarII as a result of international agreements, and voluntary evacuees whodid not file ``Change of Residence''cards. In response to this Notice, the Office of Redress Administration receivedone hundred forty-eight comments regarding these and other issues of eligibility,all of which have been placed for public inspection in the public readingroom of the ORA office. Some respondents were United States citizens ofJapanese ancestry who were relocated to Japan without consent as minorsduring World War II. These individuals expressed the belief that theirconstitutional rights had been violated at the time and to exclude themnow from compensation would brand them as disloyal Japanese Americans.Most other comments concerned the plight of individuals of Japanese ancestryfrom other American countries who were interned in the United States. Lettersfrom those so interned, and others who were not, generally supported compensationto these persons. Comments regarding voluntary evacuees who did not file``Change of Residence'' cards provided further evidence that verificationof the status of these individuals will need to be done on a case by casebasis in order to determine if such persons evacuated as a result of governmentaction. Finally, the Office of Redress Administration received lettersfrom Japanese American World War II veterans whose families had been evacuated.Some of these soldiers had been unable to return to unauthorized zonesto protect their property, while others had been prohibited from visitingtheir families in relocation centers. These veterans voiced the concernthat the Act might not include them as eligible. In drafting the proposed regulations, the Division read and consideredeach comment. The decisions that the Division made in response to thesecomments were made on a thorough consideration of the merits of each pointof view expressed in the comments. On June 14, 1989, the Department of Justice published a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) for the implementation of section 105 of the Civil LibertiesAct of 1988. 54 FR 25291. By July 14, 1989, the close of the comment period,the Division had received 157 comments, 146 from individuals, 9 from organizationsrepresenting the interests of Japanese Americans, and 2 from members ofCongress. Of these comments, 130 were based on two form letters supportingeligibility for three groups determined ineligible in the proposed regulation:Japanese American minors who were relocated to Japan during World War II,children of parents who had voluntarily evacuated from the excluded zones,and Latin American Japanese brought to the United States for internmentduring World War II. Thirteen other comments expressed concern that therequirements for documents for verification of identity were unduly burdensome.The Division read and analyzed each comment. In response to these commentsthe Office of Redress Administration made changes to the proposed regulationsincorporating suggestions where appropriate. However, such changes werenot made on the basis of the number of comments addressing any one pointbut on a thorough consideration of the merits of the points of view expressedin the comments. Other non-substantive changes were made in order to providefurther clarification of the implementation procedures. <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Responses to Comments and Summary of the Regulations and Revisions</ITAG>These regulations, which consist of five subparts, implement section 105of the Act. Subpart A states the purpose of the regulation and defineskey terms; subpart B lists the categories of individuals determined tobe eligible or ineligible in accordance with the statute; subpart C establishesa procedure through which the Office of Redress Administration will identifyand locate all eligible individuals; subpart D establishes the proceduresfor payment; and subpart E establishes an appeals process whereby an individualwho is determined by the Redress Administrator to be ineligible may petitionfor a reconsideration of that finding. The first issue of eligibility is concerned with the statutory thresholdrequirement that an eligible person be an individual of ``Japanese ancestry.''Records of the evacuation period indicate that there were approximately80 non-Japanese who were interned with their Japanese American spousesor children. (It is estimated that perhaps 40 such persons are still living.)The Government required these persons to sign a waiver of their rightsas non-excluded individuals in order to accompany spouses or children toassembly centers and relocation camps. These wives, husbands and parentsexecuted WPC Form PM-7, ``Request and Waiver of Non-Excluded Person,''which requested leave to accompany a member of his or her family throughall the stages of evacuation and internment as if they were persons ofJapanese ancestry. In reality these non-Japanese spouses and parents wereconfronted by a horrifying choice. They could either ``elect'' to accompanytheir spouses or children throughout the removal and internment process,or choose to be separated from them. In the event that there was no Japaneseparent or adult relative to accompany the child the Government policy wasto take the part-Japanese child and place him or her in an institutionand later transfer the child to the Children's Center under the supervisionof the War Relocation Authority at Manzanar, California. Obviously, everyhuman instinct would compel these parents to ``elect'' evacuation. Unfortunately, however, section 108(2) of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988limits the definition of an ``eligible individual'' specifically to ``anyindividual of Japanese ancestry.'' Indeed, the focus throughout the Actis on those of Japanese ancestry and the discrimination they suffered basedon their race. In light of the specificity with which Congress has spokenand its focus on the racial discrimination suffered, it must be concludedthat the statute authorizes compensation be paid only to those of Japaneseancestry, and not to those who are of non-Japanese ancestry but who werenevertheless interned. Although the phrase ``of Japanese ancestry'' in the Civil Liberties Actof 1988 cannot be interpreted in the regulation to include non-Japanesefamily members for purposes of compensation, it is undeniable that theseindividuals suffered the very injury that the Civil Liberties Act of 1988is designed to redress and compensate, and that they should be compensated.Therefore, the Department will submit legislation to the Congress to amendthe Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to render eligible those non-Japanese familymembers who suffered the effects of the government's internment policyby accompanying their spouses or children of Japanese ancestry throughthe evacuation and internment process.A second area of inquiry regarding eligibility pertains to the method ofconfinement. It is clear from the findings by the Commission on WartimeRelocation of Civilians that the evacuation, relocation or internment ofthe Japanese Americans and Japanese resident aliens was not a single uniformaction. Indeed, in section 108(2)(B)(i) (I)-(III) Congress specificallyincluded language to ensure that the Act covered individuals confined,held in custody, relocated, or ``otherwise deprived of liberty or property''as a result of any action taken by the United States or its agents solelyon the basis of Japanese ancestry during the period from December 7, 1941to June 30, 1946. Therefore, in addition to persons deprived of libertyor property solely on the basis of Japanese ancestry by placement in relocationcenters under the supervision of the Wartime Relocation Authority, or incamps under the authority of the Department of Justice or the U.S. Army,others who were deprived of liberty by other Government actions would alsobe eligible. As the discussion below illustrates, the language ``otherwisedeprived of liberty or property as a result (of government actions)'' maybe interpreted to include several categories of individuals. One exampleof a deprivation of liberty could be institutionalized persons who wereunable to evacuate from the prohibited areas and were placed in the custodyof the Wartime Relocation Authority. In addition, some individuals who were members of the U.S. Armed Forceson or before mandatory evacuation on March 31, 1942, and not dischargedfrom duty by that date, and whose domiciles were in excluded areas, couldbe determined to be eligible under section 108(2)(B)(i) as persons ``otherwisedeprived of liberty or property'' as a result of the acts enumerated insubsections (I), (II), and (III). The Western Defense Command Public ProclamationNo. 11, dated August 18, 1942, excluded all Japanese citizens and aliensfrom Military Area No. 1 and the California portion of Military Area No.2 without first securing written permission of the Western Defense Command.As a result, there were some soldiers who were unable to re-enter unauthorizedzones and safeguard their property. Such persons, as well as those whoseproperty was confiscated by the government, could be considered to havebeen ``deprived of property'' as a result of the exclusion policy. The issue concerning deprivation of property was raised in the AttorneyGeneral Adjudication for the Japanese American Evacuation Act of 1948.In <T3>Hirotoshi Oda, </T3>1 Adjudications of the Attorney General 361 (No.146-35-16597, November 5, 1954), it was held that persons of Japanese ancestrywho were members of the Armed Forces and sustained property losses as aresult of the exclusion policy were as much entitled to compensation underthe Act as if they had been evacuated to assembly centers and relocationcenters with the other members of their families. In light of the statutorylanguage of the 1988 Act and the expressed purpose of that Act, such personsmay be eligible for redress. Finally, some Japanese American soldiers were ``deprived of liberty'' byvirtue of the fact that regulations prohibited them from entering relocationcenters to visit their family members or forced Japanese American soldiersto submit to undue restrictions amounting to a deprivation of liberty priorto visiting their families. (This group could also include a small percentageof members of the United States Armed Forces of Japanese ancestry fromHawaii whose families were interned.) One respondent questioned the singlingout of the members of the military for eligibility and not other non-militarypersons of Japanese ancestry who were temporarily outside the prohibitedzone and who may also have sustained property losses as a result of exclusionpolicy. We note that the regulations specifically set forth two categoriesof eligibility for the military, andSection; 74.3 (b)(4) and (b)(5); however,the regulations also provide in andSection; 74.3(c) that other individualsmay be determined eligible under the Act on a case-by-case basis. Another major issue of eligibility concerns those persons who were notinterned but who evacuated their places of residence during the evacuation,relocation and internment period. The central question in determining eligibilityin such cases is whether the individuals concerned evacuated their placesof residence ``as a result of'' one or other of the statutorily specifiedtypes of governmental action. See section 108(2)(B). Thus, if the individualsin question were ordered by the military to evacuate an area, their evacuationwas clearly a result of a governmental action. Similarly, if they evacuatedin order to avoid internment, their evacuation resulted from governmentalaction. In contrast, if they evacuated voluntarily, not in response toany governmental order, it would seem that they are not eligible. Some individuals evacuated as a result of specific governmental or militarydirectives. President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, empowering theSecretary of War and the Military Commanders whom he might designate toprescribe military areas from which ``any and all persons may be excluded''was issued on February 19, 1942. However, even as early as December 7,1941, agents of the government were taking custody of enemy aliens, includingJapanese. On January 29, 1942, the Department of Justice announced thefirst of a series of zones prohibited to enemy aliens on the West Coast,ordering such persons not to enter or remain in such areas after February24, 1942. On February 10, 1942, the Department of Justice warned all Japanesealiens (of a total Japanese and Japanese American population of about 3,500)to evacuate Terminal Island, near Los Angeles: That evacuation took place,under orders of the Navy, on February 25, 1942. Apart from these earlyevacuations preceding Executive Order 9066, there was at least one latercase of evacuations undertaken in response to a specific military directive.On March 24, 1942, after the issuance of Executive Order 9066, but beforeevacuation from Military Area No. 1 was required by orders of the WestCoast Military Commander, persons of Japanese ancestry were ordered toevacuate Bainbridge Island, near Seattle.The statute reaches all of the above-described situations. Even assumingthat none of these evacuations ``resulted from'' Executive Order 9066,section 108(2)(B)(i)(III) declares evacuees eligible if their relocationresulted from any ``directive of the Armed Forces of the United States,or other action taken by or on behalf of the United States or its agents,representatives, officers, or employees.'' Thus, actions of the Departmentof Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Army, the Navy, orany other federal entity, to exclude, relocate or intern persons of Japanesedescent, whether taken pursuant to Executive Order 9066 or not, providethe basis for eligibility for these groups of evacuees. Another group of persons involuntarily evacuated who are deemed eligibleunder the regulations consist of those who left their places of residenceon the West Coast between March 2, 1942, the issuance of Public ProclamationNo. 1, and March 29, 1942, the date on which the Public Proclamation No.4 took effect whereby persons of Japanese ancestry were prohibited fromleaving parts of the West Coast area because the Government was preparingto forcibly relocate them later. Section 108(2)(B)(ii) of the Act definesas eligible one who ``was enrolled on the records of the United StatesGovernment during the period beginning on December 7, 1941, and endingon June 30, 1946, as being in a prohibited military zone.'' The ConferenceReport explains this language as a reference to some 4,889 Japanese Americanswho left the West Coast during the so-called ``voluntary'' phase of theGovernment's evacuation program, and who filed ``Change of Residence''cards with the Wartime Civil Control Administration: ``The conferees intendto include individuals who filed Change of Residence cards during the periodbetween the issuance of Public Proclamation No. 1, on March 2, 1942 andpublic proclamation No. 4 on March 27, 1942 as being `enrolled on the recordsof the U.S. Government.' '' While some individuals may have evacuated afterMarch 2, 1942, but not have been enrolled on such cards, they may be determinedon a case by case basis to be eligible if such persons were directly orderedby the Government to evacuate. (Clearly, any person of Japanese ancestrywho was evacuated from an excluded zone <T3>after </T3>March 29, 1942 is eligible, since such an evacuation wouldhave been a ``result'' either of Executive Order 9066 or of a militarydirective issued pursuant to it.) There remain those cases, if any, of evacuations occurring <T3>before </T3>March 2, 1942, but <T3>not </T3>in response to a governmental order directed specificallyat the evacuees. We believe that if there are any such evacuees, they cannotbe considered eligible. The Office of Redress Administration also received comments pertainingto the eligibility of certain categories of persons who were minors duringthe internment period. We received 63 comments stating that Japanese Americanchildren born after the parents had voluntarily relocated from the prohibitedzones or had departed from relocation centers or internment camps shouldbe eligible. While children born in assembly centers, relocations campsand internment camps are included as eligible for compensation, the regulationsdo not include as eligible children born after their parents had voluntarilyrelocated from prohibited military zones or from assembly centers, relocationcamps, or internment camps. One comment pointed out that children of Japanese ancestry born in internmentcamps during the internment period were not specifically listed in theregulations. Such persons were intended to be included as eligible in theproposed regulations and therefore, andSection; 74.3(b)(7) has been amendedto include as eligible children of Japanese ancestry born in the internmentcamps during the internment period in addition to those born in assemblycenters and relocation camps. A unique eligibility issue pertains to minors who were relocated to Japanduring the period beginning on December 7, 1941 and ending on September2, 1945. Records indicate that some minors who were United States citizenswere relocated with their families during this period. The Division received61 comments in support of the eligibility of these minors. However, inimplementing section 105 of the Act, the Department must follow the clearlyrestrictive language in section 108(2) that specifically excludes any individualwho during the period beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on September2, 1945, relocated to a country while the United States was at war withthat country. Consequently, the exclusionary language of the Act wouldpreclude from eligibility the minors, as well as adults, who were relocatedto Japan during that particular time period. The last major eligibility issue pertains to persons of Japanese ancestrywho were sent to the United States from other American countries for restraintand repatriation pursuant to international commitments of the United StatesGovernment for the security of the United States and its associated powers.We received 77 comments advocating that all such individuals should beeligible for redress. The plight of these persons is described in the Appendixto Part I of <T3>Personal Justice Denied. </T3>Although these individuals were evacuated,relocated or interned similarly to those of Japanese ancestry evacuatedfrom the West Coast, the statute's threshold requirement that an eligibleperson must be a citizen of the United States or a permanent resident alienexcludes most of these persons from redress payment. Records indicate thatthe people who entered the United States under these international agreementswere determined by the Department of Justice to be illegal aliens. As such,they were not lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.Consequently, the restrictive language of the Act pertaining to citizenshipstatus renders such persons ineligible. On the other hand, after WorldWar II some of the Latin American Japanese who were brought to the UnitedStates from other American republics for internment were permitted, underapplicable statutes, to apply to the Attorney General of the United Statesfor an adjustment of their immigration status; these individuals obtainedthe status of permanent resident alien extending retroactively to the internmentperiod. Such persons would meet the threshold statutory requirement underthe regulations of being permanent resident aliens during the evacuation,relocation and internment period and, as such, be eligible for compensation.In addition, children born in the United States to the Latin American Japaneseduring their internment would, by virtue of their place of birth, be UnitedStates citizens and therefore meet the threshold requirement for eligibility.While this preamble has endeavored to discuss eligibility issues of publicconcern, andSection; 74.3 of the regulations specifically sets forth thosecategories of individuals who are eligible or ineligible for compensationunder Section 105 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Verification Procedures </ITAG>The Act forbids the Government from requiring persons to file claims forredress payments, but states that the Attorney General shall locate andidentify all eligible persons by using records already in the possessionof the United States Government. However, any eligible person is free tonotify the Attorney General and advise him of the individual's claim ofeligibility. In addition to using Federal Government records, the AttorneyGeneral may use any facility or resource of any public or nonprofit organizationor any other record document or information that may be made availableto the Government. Section 74.5 describes the official and unofficial sourcesthat the Government anticipates using for identification and location ofeligible persons. Section 74.6 describes the procedures whereby the Officeshall endeavor to locate eligible individuals.All information compiled in these files is subject to the statutory mandatesof the Privacy Act. Therefore, the Civil Rights Division is prohibitedfrom using or releasing this information for purposes other than thosedescribed in the Division's Privacy Act Notice of Records Systems. 54 FR13252. After an individual is determined to be eligible, the regulations providefor a letter of notification to be sent to the individual to notify himor her of a preliminary finding of eligibility. (andSection; 74.7) Enclosedwith the letter will be a form and a request for documentation. The Divisionattached draft forms which were appended to the proposed regulations asAppendix A to Part 74. The forms are unsworn declarations under penaltyof perjury. (28 U.S.C. 1746) The purpose of these forms and the requestsfor documentation is to verify the identity of the individuals eligiblefor redress in order to prevent fraud or duplication of payments. We received 13 comments pertaining to our requests for documentation. Theseletters expressed concern that the requirements to submit <T3>original </T3>documents, particularly to document the date of birthof a candidate are unduly burdensome. In response to such comments andSection;74.7(b) has been amended to eliminate the requirement of submission ofa photo identification with the current legal name. In addition, documentationrequirements in Appendix A to Part 74 have been modified to accept certifiedcopies in lieu of original records as evidence of birth or current legalname and address. Furthermore, we have waived the documentation of dateof birth for persons whose identification has been confirmed by the SocialSecurity Administration (SSA). (We estimate that SSA has confirmed overone-third of the possible 60,000 surviving eligible persons.) Finally,ORA will establish a telephone number for persons to call for advice aboutdocumentation. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Notification and Payment </ITAG>Upon receipt of a person's unsworn declaration and documentation, the RedressAdministrator will make a final determination of eligibility for paymentand notify the individual in writing of his finding. (andSection; 74.8) Asrequired by statute, a person determined to be eligible has up to eighteenmonths after notification to accept payment. The statute states that aperson who accepts payment waives all claims against the United Statesarising from government actions described in the Act. The regulations alsoincorporate the statutory requirement that the refusal to accept paymentby a person determined to be eligible must be in writing and such refusalwill be final for that person and his or her survivors. (andSection; 74.11)After funds have been appropriated and actual payments are to be made,the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights will certify authorizationfor payment to the Assistant Attorney General for Justice Management, whowill give final authorization to the Secretary of the Treasury. (andSection;74.10) Payments will be made beginning with the oldest living eligibleperson that has been identified at the date the notice goes out, or hisor her survivors, until all eligible persons have received payment. (andSection;74.12) In accordance with the statute, the categories of survivors whocan receive redress payments are limited to spouses, children, and parents.(andSection; 74.l3) The methods for establishing proof of relationship tothe deceased eligible person are set forth in andSection; 74.14. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Appeal Procedures </ITAG>In order to fairly resolve those cases in which the Administrator makesa determination of ineligibility, the regulations have established an appealprocess. When an individual is notified in writing of the Administrator'sfinding of ineligibility and reason or reasons for the finding, the letteralso shall inform the individual that he or she may petition for a reconsiderationof the determination of ineligibility to the Assistant Attorney Generalfor Civil Rights, or the official designated by the Assistant AttorneyGeneral for Civil Rights, and that he or she has the right to submit documentationin support of his or her claim of eligibility. (andSection; 74.15) The regulationsalso provide procedures for filing a request for reconsideration. (andSection;74.16) Section 74.17 describes the appeal procedure whereby the Assistant AttorneyGeneral for Civil Rights, or the official designated to act on his behalf,reviews the determination of the Redress Administrator and any documentationsubmitted by the requester, and then notifies the requester of his or herdecision to reverse or affirm the Redress Administrator's determinationof ineligibility. The decision shall constitute the final action of theDepartment on that appeal.
