For example: the OMP steam cleaning device is an improvedversion of a known device designed to clean water walls and the OVD longrange water cleaning device is the first device of its type designedto clean water walls in boilers that burn fuels that produce a high levelof slag. Emphasis is placed on a new type of pulse chamber with a relaxationoscillation frequency of 0.02-10 Hz which works in deflagration and detonationmodes. It has saved the power plants belonging to the Ministry of Powerand plants belonging to the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy 17 millionrubles a year.</TEXT></DOC>
