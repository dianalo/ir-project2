The case involves Wanjiru Gutu, a barren widow, who 10 years agotook Mary Njeri Macharia as a ``wife'' to bear her the children shedesperately wanted.   The relationship went sour and the women have asked aWestern-style divorce court to sort out their broken marriage,including the question of alimony, child support and propertysettlement.   ``We don't have a precedent for this case,'' said Paul Mberi,Ms. Macharia's lawyer.   ``The problem we have is that our legal system as practiced inthe courts is changing to the Western legal system. But at the sametime, in the village we are living with people whose arrangementsare based on customary law concepts.''   Marriage between women is not uncommon in Kenya and neither isdivorce.   But this case is unique because the couple has turned to Westernlaws, instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal eldersdecide the issue.   Barren women, such as Ms. Gutu, often take one or more fertilewomen as ``wives'' to bear children, which the female ``husband''then claims as her own. Even married women make such arrangements,with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by hisspouse's wife.   Barren women often are ostracized in Africa, where wealth andprestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has.   Since both Ms. Macharia and Ms. Gutu were single, Ms. Machariawas entitled to choose the man to father the children.   For the surrogate mother, such an arrangement offers thesecurity of a home and income.   Ms. Macharia, in her late 20s, was a single mother of twochildren, aged 12 and 10, when she married Ms. Gutu and took hersurname. She brought them to Ms. Gutu's home and had two morechildren, now 7 and 5.   After a fierce quarrel in January 1986, Ms. Gutu chased her``wife'' from their matrimonial home in the western Kenyan town ofNakuru, according to court records.   Before turning to the Western-style courts, Ms. Macharia twicewent to a court of tribal elders, asking for alimony and childsupport or a share of Ms. Gutu's property, including a smallgrocery store.   Ms. Gutu, about 60, complained that Ms. Macharia beat her,threatened her life and stole from the business.   Both times the elders ruled that Ms. Macharia could keep thechildren but should receive nothing else.   ``This was not a hardship in the past, as the woman would goback to her father and his community, which jointly owned andshared land and resources,'' explained Gibson Kamau Kuria, aNairobi lawyer who specializes in family law.   Ms. Macharia did return to her father, a peasant farmer nearNakuru. But when she felt that she and the children were a burden,she sued her former ``husband'' for divorce in the districtmagistrate's court, again demanding alimony and child support or ashare of Ms. Gutu's property.   She filed suit in August 1986, but the case has been delayed bya backlog and is expected to be heard soon.   Ms. Gutu had told the tribal courts Ms. Macharia had no money orproperty when they married, and that the relationsip gave herstatus and a comfortable lifestyle.   Odhiambo Ochieng', Ms. Gutu's lawyer, argues in an affidavitthat because the marriage is recognized only by customary law, onlya traditional solution is possible: for Ms. Macharia to return toher father's family with nothing.   Kenya's very diversity is at the root of the now-budding legalproblems.   The East African nation's 22 million people are divided amongdozens of ethnic groups who abide by Islamic, Hindu and varioustribal customary laws in addition to the statutory Western lawsinherited from British colonizers at independence 25 years ago.   A case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer, S.M.Otieno, against his Luo clansmen in a tussle over whether the widowor the tribe should bury him. The High Court ruled that in theabsence of written law, customary law prevails.   Otieno's widow lost.   ``These problems are going to have to be tackled and will not goaway until Kenya is lived in by an overall younger and more moderngeneration,'' Ochieng' said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tue AMs, May 3</NOTE></DOC>
