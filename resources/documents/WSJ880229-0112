Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM RFD </IN><TEXT>   John W. Kluge is detouring from glitz and high tech to meat and potatoes.    The billionaire, who has a significant stake in Orion Pictures Corp. and has previously invested in the broadcasting and entertainment businesses, plans to acquire Dayton, Ohio-based Ponderosa Inc., the family steakhouse chain.    Secaucus, N.J.-based Metromedia Co., Mr. Kluge's closely held partnership, said it reached a definitive agreement to purchase Ponderosa's parent, PON Holding Corp., from New York investor Asher Edelman and companies he controls. Terms weren't disclosed.    &quot;We think Ponderosa is in a market segment where we can clearly become the leader,&quot; said Stuart Subotnick, Metromedia's executive vice president and general partner. Its customers tend to be older -- a growing population segment -- and its outlets are concentrated in the Midwest's Rust Belt, which is resurging, he said. &quot;Demographically and geographically, it sits well, and it is profitable,&quot; he said.    With annual sales of about $500 million, Ponderosa owns more than 400 steak restaurants, while franchisees own another 280; all are in the U.S. and Canada. &quot;We are looking at expansion situations on an international basis, and there are a lot of places to grow here&quot; in the U.S., Mr. Subotnick said.    Largely because of oversupply, the restaurant industry -- including fast-food outlets -- has endured several difficult years. Some operations have gone private, dodging Wall Street's criticism about disappointing earnings, while others have cut their rate of expansion, analysts say. Still others are trying to boost sales at existing outlets. And all are concentrating on marketing.    &quot;It's a lot more difficult to get the consumer's food-away-from-home dollar,&quot; said Leslie Steppel, restaurant analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. As menus differ little in mid-priced family restaurants, &quot;Marketing has become the critical variable in differentiating your product from your competitors,&quot; said Ms. Steppel.    Moreover, said Ronald Paul, an industry consultant, consumer demand is shifting to home-delivered and pick-up-and-take-out foods. With the overall industry growing at no more than 2% annually, &quot;Operators are literally scrambling for share of stomach,&quot; Mr. Paul said.    Ponderosa occupies the mid-priced family restaurant segment, which includes rival Sizzler Restaurants Inc. &quot;The two are likely neck and neck&quot; in market share, Mr. Paul said. Metromedia's Mr. Subotnick put Ponderosa's market share of the family steakhouse business at 20%. Citing Ponderosa's good locations and strong market position, Mr. Paul said, its prospects are good.    Mr. Edelman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
