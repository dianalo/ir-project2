Hussein Musawi also said the May 19 massacre of sevenPalestinian laborers by an Israeli gunman will hurt efforts to freethe six American hostages in Lebanon.   ``I believe and hope that some of the British hostages could befreed if Margaret Thatcher deported Salman Rushdie from England,''Musawi said.   Rushdie, an Indian-born naturalized Briton, was sentenced todeath by Iran's revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini, in February 1989 for allegedly blaspheming Islam in hisnovel, ``The Satanic Verses.''   ``She doesn't have to hand him over to us or send him to Iran orSyria,'' he said. ``It would be enough if she gave us proof that hehas left the country.   ``She can send him anywhere she wants,'' Musawi said from hisheadquarters in the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek in east Lebanon.   The Britons and Americans are among 16 Westerners missing inLebanon. Most are held by pro-Iranian Shiite factions. Longest-heldis Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for theAssociated Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.   Iran severed relations with Britain in February 1989 afterBritain accused the Iranians of terrorism and protested Khomeini'sdeath threat. Rushdie has been in hiding under guard ever since.   Iran and Syria helped obtain the release last month of Americanhostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed as ``goodwill gestures.''   But the Iranians have said no more Americans will be freed untilWashington makes a reciprocal gesture. President Bush has refused,citing his policy of not negotiating with terrorists and those whosupport them.   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday reiterated Iran'saccusation that the West had made no move to obtain the release of``Iranian, Lebanese and Palestinian hostages'' to reciprocate forthe release of American hostages.   Rafsanjani referred to Palestinians and Lebanese Shiite Moslemsheld by Israel and their Christian allies in southern Lebanon, andfour Iranians kidnapped and missing in the Christian enclave inLebanon in 1982.   ``I believe that the British, unlike the Americans, are nowbehaving in a positive manner that may encourage thehostage-holders to free a British hostage as a goodwill gesture,''Musawi said.   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, a pro-Syrian faction within theIranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, believed the parentmovement for the extremists holding Westerners.   He is also reputed mentor of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine, a Shiite faction that holds American educators JesseTurner and Alann Steen.   Musawi was believed to have been instrumental in securing therelease of Polhill April 22. But he urged kidnappers not to freeReed after the U.S. Congress endorsed a united Jerusalem asIsrael's capital two days later.   Musawi made his remarks as radical Iranian newspapers in Tehransaid that any British effort to restore relations with Tehran werepointless so long as Mrs. Thatcher's government defends Rushdie.   ``London's efforts are doomed if they are directed to secureSalman Rushdie's life,'' the Jomhuri Islami daily said in aneditorial.   The British captives are Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, whodisappeared Jan. 20, 1987; journalist John McCarthy, kidnappedApril 17, 1986; ex-Royal Air Force pilot Jack Mann, kidnapped May12, 1989, and writer Alec Collett, kidnapped March 25, 1985.   Musawi's remarks came a day after the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihadfor the Liberation of Palestine said it would make the UnitedStates and Israel ``pay the price'' for the killing the unarmedPalestinians by a former Israeli soldier.   ``This massacre will have a negative effect on the issue of theAmerican hostages,'' Musawi said.   ``Israelis cannot do anything without American backing. This ishow things are linked in the minds and thoughts of our people,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
