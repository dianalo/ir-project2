So powerful is this strange venture into pedagogicalnihilism that it has succeeded in the past decade inradically altering the nature of liberal education in thiscountry. As a consequence, many important fields ofhumanistic study -- not only literature, philosophy, religionand law, but Western civilization itself -- have beenrendered morally repulsive and intellectually dysfunctional.Deconstruction may not account for everything that has gonewrong in the academy today, but it nonetheless occupies acentral place in the current educational debacle.</LP><TEXT>   For this reason we have long needed a book that wouldclearly and effectively explain this catastrophic developmentto nonacademic readers -- to the parents who send their kidsto college, to the alumni who write the checks for almamater, to the people who serve on the governing boards of oureducational institutions, and to the legislators, foundationofficers and corporation executives who provide a good dealof their support. Now at last David Lehman, a well-knowncritic and poet, has given us such a book in &quot;Signs of theTimes&quot; (Poseidon, 318 pages, $21.95).   Vividly written, thoroughly researched, even-tempered andreadable in its exposition of complicated, even contradictoryideas, yet appropriately angry at the gigantic intellectualand moral fraud that has been perpetrated by the votaries ofdeconstruction, this book is about a good deal more thanacademic controversy. It is about the &quot;critical terrorism,&quot;as it has been called, that has now supplanted traditionalmodes of humanistic study in the classroom, and made itslethal effects felt in other areas of cultural life.   What makes &quot;Signs of the Times&quot; an especially compellingintroduction to deconstruction and its consequences is thedivision of the book into two parts, one historical, theother biographical, with the latter serving as a highlydramatic illustration of the ghastly ideas described in theformer. In the first part, called &quot;The Rise ofDeconstruction,&quot; Mr. Lehman traces the intellectual historyof the movement in some detail. He identifies its principalexponents and arguments, documents its main effects and thekind of opposition it has aroused, and discusses the way theword itself has prospered in the realm of popular usage.   It is in this first section, too, that Mr. Lehmanpainstakingly makes his case against deconstruction by meansof abundant example and skillful exposition, establishing thebasis for his grim conclusion that deconstructionism isindeed what the Harvard scholar Walter Jackson Bate hascalled &quot;a nihilistic view of literature, of humancommunication, and of life itself,&quot; and what Mr. Lehman goeson to describe as an assault on &quot;the legitimacy ofinstitutions and traditions, canons of taste and judgment,and received values of any kind.&quot;   That this conclusion is wholly justified is made all themore persuasive in the second part of &quot;Signs of the Times,&quot;which is called &quot;The Fall of Paul de Man.&quot; This focuses onthe biography of the Belgian-born literary critic Paul de Man(1919-83), who was probably more responsible than any othersingle figure in establishing deconstruction at the verycenter of American academic life.   Mr. Lehman calls de Man &quot;America's archdeacon ofdeconstruction.&quot; He has also been described as the&quot;godfather&quot; of the Yale &quot;Mafia,&quot; for it was owing to de Man'stenure there in the years 1970-83 that Yale became thecommand post of the entire deconstructivist movement. De Manhimself was the object of an academic cult-admired,worshipped and feared.   It therefore came as a bombshell when, in 1987, The NewYork Times reported that this paragon of &quot;intellectualhonesty,&quot; as one of his followers called him, had actuallycollaborated with the Nazis in Belgium during World War II. Aresearcher had turned up the anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi articlesthat de Man had written for the principal fascist papers inBelgium in the early 1940s, when it looked as if Hitler wasgoing to triumph. Mr. Lehman includes his own translation ofthe most notorious of these articles -- &quot;The Jews inContemporary Literature&quot; (1941) -- as an appendix to &quot;Signsof the Times.&quot;   In addition to Nazism, de Man turned out to have dabbledin swindling and bigamy. So the arch-deconstructionist whohad insisted upon the complete separation of literature fromhistory and morality, who had argued that &quot;empirical events&quot;were to be regarded as &quot;merely linguistic predicaments,&quot; hadample reason to suppress ethics, morality, religion, politicsand history as irrelevant to humanistic study. Or, as Mr.Lehman observes, &quot;he himself had everything to gain byapplying a wet sponge to the blackboard of history.&quot;   All of this would have been scandal enough for theacademic panjandrums who had worshipped at de Man's shrineand spread his gospel far and wide. But worse was to comewhen the leaders of the deconstructionist movement respondedby denying the relevance of these revelations and thenmounting a campaign of vilification against those who hadrevealed the truth about de Man's past. As Mr. Lehman writesin his last chapter, &quot;In their briefs for de Man, {thedeconstructionists} have provided a dossier of proof thatdeconstruction is not a value-free science but a program thatpromotes a reckless disregard of the truth and a propensityfor hero worship.&quot; The idol had fallen, but as Mr. Lehmanalso reminds us, his followers -- tenured, unrepentant andstill powerful -- remain in place.   ---   Mr. Kramer is the editor of the New Criterion, a monthlyreview.</TEXT></DOC>
