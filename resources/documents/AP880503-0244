International Lease Finance Corp. expects to choose next weekbetween 100 and 120 planes in an order expected to exceed $4billion. The Beverly Hills, Calif., company buys commercialaircraft to lease to airlines around the world.   Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease Finance,said quality control at Boeing is a consideration in his company'spurchase decisions. After complaints recently from Japan Air Lines,All Nippon Airways and British Airways, Boeing ``is working thoseproblems and making corrections,'' he said Monday.   An incident in which a section of fuselage ripped away last weekon a 737 flying over Hawaii also is a factor, along with economics,Udvar-Hazy said.   ``These are all factors. We are looking for the best product,the most reliable and with good economic terms,'' he said.   He said his company's board of directors plans to make adecision on the order next Tuesday. Company officials were to meetwith Boeing executives in Seattle today.   ``We like to have the most popular aircraft in the fleet, whatairlines demand and what they feel comfortable with,'' Udvar-Hazysaid.   Boeing planes being considered include the 737-500, 737-300,737-400, 757-200, 767-300ER and 747-400.   Udvar-Hazy said the leasing company also is negotiating withMcDonnell Douglas and Airbus, a European aerospace consortium.   It's a ``strong possibility'' the order will be either for allBoeing aircraft or for a split between McDonnell Douglas andAirbus, Udvar-Hazy said. He said a three-way deal is ``highlyunlikely.''   A $4 billion firm order would be larger than any in Boeinghistory. The company's largest order was for $4.1 billion worth of747-400 jumbo jets in 1986 from British Airways, but that includedoptions for 12 planes as well as 16 firm orders.   The International Lease fleet is about 70 percent Boeing, andits customers include both domestic and foreign airlines.   Neither McDonnell Douglas nor Airbus alone offers the variety ofaircraft sizes and ranges necessary to satisfy InternationalLease's airline clients, but together they could produce aselection comparable to the Boeing offering, Udvar-Hazy said.   Airbus planes being considered are the A230, A330 and A310 twinjets and the four-engine, long-range A340. St. Louis-basedMcDonnell Douglas is offering its twin-engine MD-80 and MD-90sseries, plus the proposed MD-11 wide-bodied jetliner, which has notyet flown.   Some industry analysts said they expected Boeing to get the nod.   Boeing's ability to deliver planes on time is the key factor,they said. Airbus' production capacity is nowhere near Boeing's.Last year Airbus produced 32 planes, compared with Boeing's 273.   ``With the value of the dollar where it is, I don't see how it(International Lease) can't not buy Boeing planes,'' said TomLloyd-Butler, an aerospace analyst with Montgomery Securities inSan Francisco.   ``If there is a disadvantage to splitting an order between thethree manufacturers, it's also probably true that there's noadvantage to splitting it between Airbus and McDonnell Douglas,''said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
