(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six Andean condors arenapping and munching on beef and chopped rats as they await releaseinto the wild in an experiment aimed at saving their Californiacondor cousins from extinction.   ``It will be a credit to humankind if we can preserve the animalsof the Earth, and the condor is but one animal facing direstraits,'' said Jeff Opdycke, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceofficial who toured the Andean condor release site with reportersTuesday.   Of thousands of California condors that once soared in the early1800s, only 28 of the vulture-like, carrion-eating birds remainalive. With 9-1@2-foot wingspans, they are North America's largestbird.   All the survivors are in captive breeding programs at the LosAngeles Zoo and San Diego Wild Animal Park.   In five to 10 years, after enough of them have produced offspringin captivity, some of the young birds will be re-introduced into thewild in another attempt to avoid extinction.   To learn the best way to release the California condors andassure their survival, researchers are using young Andean condorsdonated by various zoos as stand-ins for their more endangeredrelatives. One thousand to 2,000 Andean condors remain in the wildsof South America.   ``These are surrogates,'' said Joseph Dowhan, condor recoverycoordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ``We're going to testrelease techniques, release sites, and train people.''   Seven of the Andean birds will be freed in December and Januaryinto the 53,000-acre Sespe Condor Sanctuary, 50 miles northwest ofdowntown Los Angeles.   Along with up to 10 others to be freed late next year, they willbe rounded up when the $440,000 study is done in two or three years,then released permanently in their native Colombia.   About a dozen reporters were allowed to observe three of thebirds on Tuesday in a tour led by officials of the Fish and WildlifeService, the U.S. Forest Service, National Audubon Society, and LosAngeles Zoo.   The three young female condors, all about five months old andweighing 19 to 21 pounds, sat in the shade, napping in thenet-enclosed half of their 35-by-16-foot roosting box, which sitsatop sawed-off telephone poles 10 feet above the ground to protectthem from black bears and coyotes.   Biologists sneak into the cage at night to deliver meals of calfmeat, ground horse meat and chopped rats, said Mike Wallace, the LosAngeles Zoo's curator of birds.   The condors displayed Tuesday will be released in January, alongwith a fourth bird that had not yet arrived.   Scientists hope that once released, the birds will stay in thesanctuary and away from areas where wild California condors diedfrom what officials believe was lead poisoning. They were poisonedby eating the carcasses of coyotes that were trapped and shot, orthe remains of wounded deer that died after escaping hunters,scientists said.   Wallace said others probably were shot, and some may have beenkilled by colliding with power lines.   Development along California's coast and San Joaquin Valley alsogradually destroyed much condor habitat, researchers believe.   So far, only one California condor chick has been hatched incaptivity. That is the seven-month-old Moloko, who resides at theSan Diego Wild Animal Park. Dowhan hopes one to five more chickswill hatch next year.   Four of the last five wild breeding pairs of California condorsvanished in 1984-1985. In 1986, the Fish and Wildlife Service made acontroversial decision to round up the last six wild birds toprevent their demise.   So far, attempts to save the condors have cost about $20 million.</TEXT></DOC>
