Background </ITAG>EPA issued a final rule under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) and (B), publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of February 26, 1988 (53 FR 5932), that establishedhealth effects testing requirements for DGBE and DGBA. The rule requireddermal pharmacokinetics testing in rats to determine the absorption andbiotransformation of DGBE administered dermally, and the dermal absorptionof DGBA. The test standard, in 40 CFR 795.225(b)(2)(iv)(E), required thatrats be dosed once dermally, that the dosed area be occluded with an aluminumpatch, and that the dose be kept on the skin for the duration of the study(96 hours). After dosing, the animals were to be placed in metabolism cagesfor excreta collection for at least 96 hours and, if necessary, daily thereafteruntil at least 90 percent of the dose had been excreted, or until 7 daysafter dosing. The final rule required completion of this test and submissionof a final report by April 11, 1989, 12 months after the effective dateof the final rule, 40 CFR 799.1560(c)(4)(ii). Shortly after initiating the pharmacokinetics test, the test sponsor, EastmanKodak, notified EPA via its representative, the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (CMA) of technical difficulties encountered in trying to performthetest as required (Refs. 1 through 3, and 5). Specifically, Eastman Kodakcould not prevent leakage from the dosed area by using the required aluminumpatch, and a glass cell occlusion device developed by Eastman Kodak toremedy the problem could not be kept on the animals' backs for longer than24 to 48 hours. Despite several pilot studies to find an occlusion methodwhich could be maintained for 96 hours, none was found (Refs. 2, 4, 6,and 7 through 10). Therefore, on behalf of Eastman Kodak, CMA requestedmodifications of the pharmacokinetics test requirement which would deletethe requirement to use the aluminum patch, reduce the dose occlusion timefrom 96 hours to 24 hours, and extend the reporting deadline for the pharmacokineticstest to 10 months after EPA notified industry of its decision (Ref. 2).CMA also notified EPA that Eastman Kodak would add an extra group of animalsto the study so that the absorption of a neat, low dose of DGBE could becompared with the required absorption study of an aqueous low dose anda neat, high dose of DGBE (Ref. 2). EPA believed that the requested modifications were reasonable, however,it considered a 10-month extension excessive to complete the test and submitresults due to the considerable prior experience of the laboratory in attemptingto perform the test. Therefore, EPA proposed to modify the pharmacokinetics test for DGBA andDGBE and to grant an 8-month extension in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 31, 1989 (54 FR 13202). <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Comments </ITAG>Comments on the proposed modifications were submitted by CMA (Ref. 11).CMA clarified their intention, stated in aprotocol amendment, to applyDGBA neat (undiluted) to the low dose group and not an aqueous solutionas EPA thought. EPA agrees that this approach will allow better comparabilitywith the high dose group and stated this in the proposed rule. CMA also repeated its request to have 10 months to complete the test andsubmit results because an additional dose group has been added. EPA stillbelieves that even with the additional dose group 8 months is sufficienttime because certain study phases can be run concurrently and Eastman Kodakhas had considerable experience in attempting to perform this test. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Modifications </ITAG>Based on the difficulties encountered and documented by Eastman Kodak inattempting to perform the pharmacokinetics test of DGBE and DGBA as requiredby the section 4 test rule, EPA is modifying the pharmacokinetics teststandard as follows: Section 795.225(b)(2)(iv)(E) will require that the test substance be kepton the animal for 24 hours instead of 96 hours. After 24 hours, any testmaterial remaining on the skin will be washed off and the containment cellremoved. Radiolabeled material in the wash will be accounted for in thetotal recovery. Urine and feces will be collected at 8, 24, 48, 72, and96 hours after dosing, and, if necessary, daily thereafter until at least90 percent of the dose has been excreted or until 7 days after dosing,whichever occurs first. Under andSection; 795.225(b)(2)(ii)(B), EPA is eliminating the requirementto occlude the dosed area with an aluminum foil patch secured in placedwith adhesive tape. To produce better data, CMA has volunteered to test two,low doses of DGBE,one neat and one a 10 percent aqueous solution. EPA, therefore, is modifyingandSection; 795.225(b)(2)(ii)(A) accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Extensions </ITAG>Due to the need to suspend pharmacokinetics testing because of technicalproblems, EPA is modifying the reporting deadlines under andSection; 799.1560(c)(4)(ii)(A)and (B) to allow 8 months from the effective date of this amendment forthe completion of the test and submission of final results. One progressreport will be due 6 months after the effective date of the amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Analysis </ITAG>The modifications granted in this amendment will not significantly alterthe cost of testing. Thus, the economic analysis for the final test rulefor DGBE and DGBA is unchanged. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Executive Order 12291 EPA judged that the final test rule was not subject to the requirementof a Regulatory Impact Analysis under Executive Order 12291. EPA has determinedthat the modifications to the rule do not alter this determination. This amendment was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included in therulemaking record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., Pub. L. 96-354,September 19, 1980), EPA certified that the final test rule would not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. The modificationsto the final rule made in this rule do not change this determination. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements associated with this rule havebeen approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act,44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq. and have been assigned OMB control number 2070-0033.EPA has determined that this rule does not change existing recordkeepingor reporting requirements nor does it impose any additional recordkeepingor reporting requirements on the public. Send comments regarding this rule to Chief, Information Policy Branch,PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 795 and 799 </ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Laboratories,Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and Testing. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 22, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Linda F.
