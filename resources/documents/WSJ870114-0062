The conflict involved tough verification requirements the administration insists be added to the treaties. Setting out a hard-line position on arms control even as he submitted the treaties to the Senate for ratification, President Reagan attached proposed reservations that would require cumbersome new negotiations with Moscow, and then a second congressional vote, before they could take effect. The new conditions probably would kill the treaties because Moscow probably would refuse to renegotiate them.    Republican Senate staff members said the approach reflected White House disorganization. They said the administration hadn't consulted as closely as it would have in the past with leading GOP senators before Mr. Reagan sent up his request for ratification.    &quot;As bipartisan questions and comments at the hearing this morning made clear, the administration proposal is dead on arrival,&quot; said Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), the new committee chairman. He branded the administration reservations &quot;unwieldy and unworkable.&quot; He added, &quot;I'm afraid the president has been given some bad advice by some of his advisers.&quot;    Sen. Pell was seeking more limited reservations involving procedures for verifying whether each side complies with the terms of the treaties. Mr. Pell's spokesman, Frank Sieverts, said the senator's proposals, unlike those of the administration, were designed so that they automatically could become reciprocal under international treaty law if Moscow raises no objections.    The treaties, known as the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, were designed to restrict the explosive force of nuclear tests. Both the U.S. and the Soviets claim to have respected them, even though Senate efforts at ratification were suspended when relations between the two countries worsened during the Carter administration.    Mr. Reagan promised to submit the two treaties as part of a bargain struck with Capitol Hill on the eve of his summit meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Iceland last October. In return, House-Senate conferees agreed to drop several arms-control amendments, including one passed by the House that would bar all but a few nuclear tests. Mr. Reagan argued that the amendments would unwisely tie his hands in negotiating with Mr. Gorbachev.    Mr. Reagan has opposed a complete test ban on the ground it would interfere with development of his space defense, or Star Wars, system. He also contends that tests are needed to ensure the efficiency of nuclear weapons.    The U.S. plans to conduct its first nuclear test of the year Feb. 5. The Soviet Union has said it will end its 17-month moratorium on nuclear testing following the U.S. test.    The clash between the foreign relations committee and the White House preceded the opening tomorrow of new U.S.-Soviet arms talks in Geneva, Switzerland. U.S. officials anticipate the talks will bring new pressure on the White House to show flexibility on arms control because they expect Moscow's new chief negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov, to present a new Soviet initiative.    &quot;I think there is going to be another proposal, in the next couple of days, of a sweeping nature,&quot; said Edward Rowney, a senior administration arms-control adviser. He said a new Soviet proposal could include a recommendation to reduce or ban chemical weapons. U.S. officials have said that agreement on chemical weapons has been held up previously by Soviet unwillingness to agree to rigorous verification procedures.    Meanwhile, the administration is locked in another internal arms-control battle between the State Department and the Pentagon over mobile missiles.    The State Department wants American negotiators to be given authority to drop a previous U.S. proposal to ban long-range missiles. It argues that the proposed ban is inconsistent with the administration's plans to develop two new types of mobile missiles -- the Midgetman and the MX.    State Department officials said such contradictory policies hurt the administration's credibility with Congress, which generally has supported the Midgetman program. Administration officials, however, said the U.S. probably will keep the proposed ban on the table until the Soviets can demonstrate that it is possible to effectively monitor limits on such missiles.    Mr. Rowney said the earlier missile proposal &quot;was largely a tactic on our part&quot; designed to get the Soviets to agree to stricter verification. He said dropping the demand for a ban on long-range missiles, in which the Soviets enjoy superiority, would be a mistake because it would amount to granting Moscow a negotiating concession without getting anything in return. </TEXT></DOC>
