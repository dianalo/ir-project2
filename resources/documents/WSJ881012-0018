Thornton Sr., who merged his firm here with Hinshaw, Culbertson, Moelmann, Hoban andamp; Fuller of Chicago in 1986, has broken ranks and sued the firm for breach of contract and fraud.    In a suit filed in state court here, Mr. Thornton, an insurance-defense attorney, alleged that Hinshaw Culbertson induced him to merge his eight-lawyer firm with it and then squeezed him out of the practice. Such suits among lawyers, once unusual, are increasing as lawyers shift firms more often and mergers proliferate.    Hinshaw Culbertson &quot;represented that {Mr. Thornton} would get substantial new business from their in-house clients, generating substantially increased revenue. None of that was forthcoming,&quot; said Stephen N. Zack, an attorney for Mr. Thornton. &quot;They also represented that he'd be in charge of the operation, but immediately sent in people from Chicago.&quot;    In Chicago, Thomas Crisham, vice chairman of the management committee at Hinshaw Culbertson, one of the major firms in the Midwest with more than 300 attorneys, called the charges without merit and the suit &quot;factually inaccurate.&quot;    Mr. Crisham said that another partner, Ronald Kammer, was eventually named to run the office here as well as a second office opened recently in Boca Raton, but only after relations had soured. He said in other such mergers, the senior partner has remained as administrative partner.    Mr. Thornton's suit alleges that Hinshaw Culbertson violated an affiliation agreement with him and asks that the pact be rescinded and that he receive his receivables and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. It also alleges that Hinshaw Culbertson promised that Mr. Thornton's daughter, Jane Thornton Mastrucci, who was an associate, would be made partner next July, but later said she would never make partner.    Ms. Mastrucci left to join her father, who continues to practice here, but the other attorneys with Mr. Thornton's firm stayed on with Hinshaw Culbertson.    Mr. Zack said that hostilities intensified recently, and that as Hinshaw Culbertson prepared to move to new offices here last month, Mr. Thornton determined to make the break. He obtained a temporary restraining order to bar the removal of his furniture and files. He posted a security guard at the door, and each box was inspected before it left. The parties have since worked out a transition agreement and are asking clients to decide with whom they wish to stay.    &quot;We've merged with numerous firms over the years and never experienced negative fallout,&quot; Mr. Crisham said. &quot;This is unique.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
