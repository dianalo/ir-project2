The Partnership is a recently formed limited partnership organized underDelaware State law and is governed by an agreement of limited partnership(the ``Partnership Agreement''). The Partnership has elected to be a businessdevelopment company, and, therefore, will be subject to sections 55 through65 of the 1940 Act and to those sections of the 1940 Act made applicableto business development companies by section 59 thereof. The Partnershipwill terminate not later than December 31, 1998, unless extended for upto two additional two-year periods. 2. The Partnership filed a registration statement under the SecuritiesAct of 1933 on Form N-2 (File No. 33-21281) with respect to an offeringby the Partnership of up to 100,000 Units. Integrated Resources Marketing,Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integrated Resources, Inc. (``Integrated''),will act as the selling agent for the Units on a ``best efforts'' basis.3. The general partners of the Partnership (``General Partners'') initiallywill consist of four Individual General Partners (<T3>i.e., </T3>partners who are natural persons) and the Managing GeneralPartners. Applicants proposed that the Individual General Partners willbe comprised of three Independent General Partners (defined to be individualswho are natural persons and who are not ``interested persons'' of the Partnershipwithin the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) and one IndividualGeneral Partner who is an affiliated person of the Managing General Partneras defined in section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. The General Partners maydetermine to increase or to decrease the number of persons to serve asIndividual General Partners, however, they may not reduce the number ofIndividual General Partners to less than four persons. If at any time thenumber of Individual General Partners should for other reasons be lessthan four, the remaining Partners shall, within 90 days, designate oneor more successor Individual General Partners so as to restore the numberof Individual General Partners to not less than four. The Partnership Agreementfurther provides that a majority of such General Partners must be IndependentGeneral Partners. 4. The Managing General Partner, a Delaware partnership, will be responsiblefor purchasing investments for the Partnership which have been approvedby the Independent General Partners. The Managing General Partner willalso be responsible for providing various management and administrativeservices necessary for the ongoing operation of the Partnership and formanaging the Partnership's short-term money market instruments pursuantto a management agreement with the Partnership. The Managing General Partneris a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisors Act of1940 (the ```Advisers Act''). The general partners of the Managing GeneralPartner are Integrated Medical Venture Investments, Inc. (``IMVI''), awholly-owned subsidiary of Integrated, and BSW, Inc. BSW, Inc. and IMVIalso act as general partners of Integrated Medical Venture Management,a Delaware general partnership, which acts as the Managing General Partnerof MVP 1. 5. MVP 1, organized in 1987, is regulated under the 1940 Act as a businessdevelopment company. In addition, MVP 1 is the subject of an earlier exemptiveorder of the SEC (Investment Company Release No. IC-15881, July 17, 1987),which declares that the Independent General Partners of MVP 1, are notinterested persons of MVP 1 solely by reason of their being general partnersof MVP 1; and that the limited partners of MVP 1 with power to vote lessthan five percent of the outstanding shares are not affiliated personsof MVP 1 or any general partner thereof solely by reason of being a limitedpartners of MVP 1; and which permits the acquisition by MVP 1 from itsmanaging general partner or an affiliate thereof of certain initial venturecapital investments.6. The Individual General Partners solely will manage the Partnership,except in regard to those specific activities of the Partnership for whichthe Managing General Partner in its capacity as Managing General Partneror as investment adivser will be responsible. The Individual General Partnerswill provide overall guidance and supervision of Partnership operationsand will perform the same functions as directors of the corporation. TheIndependent General Partners will assume the responsibilities and obligationsimposed by the 1940 Act and the regulations thereunder or the disinteresteddirectors of a registered investment company. 6. The Limited Partners have no right to control the Partnership's business,but may exercise certain rights and powers of a Limited Partner under thePatnership Agreement, including voting rights and giving consents and approvalsprovided for in the Partnership Agreement. Limited Partners will be affordedall voting rights required by the 1940 Act. Applicants will obtain an opinionfrom the Delaware legal counsel for the Partnership that the existenceof these voting rights does not subject the Limited Partners to liabilityas General Partners under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited PartnershipAct. In addition, the Partnership Agreement obligates the General Partnersto take all action which may be necessary or appropriate to protect thelimited liability of the Limited Partners. An insurance policy to providecoverage to persons who become Limited Partners in the Partnership hasnot been obtained. Applicants state, however, that the General Partnerswill consider the possibility of obtaining errors and omissions insurancefor the Partnership. In light of the view of the staff of the SEC thatgenerous insurance coverage is appropriate in view of the special problemsof using the limited partnership form for registered investment companies,the Independent General Partners will review periodically the questionof the appropriateness of obtaining an errors and ommisions insurance policyfor the Partnership. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of section 2(a)(19)of the 1940 Act to the extent that the Independent General Partners ofthe Partnership would otherwise be deemed to be ``interested persons''of the Partnership and of the Managing General Partner solely because suchIndependent General Partners are general partners of the Partnership, andco-partners of any Managing General Partner. The Partnership has been structuredso that the Independent General Partners are the functional equivalentsof the disinterested directors of an incorporated investment company. Section2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act excludes from the definition of ``interested persons''of an investment company those individuals who would be ``interested persons''solely because they are directors of an investment company, but there isno equivalent exemption for partners of an investment company.2. In addition, the Independent General Partners of the Partnership maybe deemed to be ``interested persons'' of the Partnership by virtue oftheir service as Independent General Partners of MVP 1, insofar as MVP1 might be considered to be under ``common control'' with the Partnershipand thus, an affiliated person of the Partnership. Moreover, since MVP1 might be considered an affiliated person of the Partnership, Applicantsalso request that the Independent General Partners of MVP 1 not be deemed``interested persons'' of MVP 1 solely by virtue of serving as the IndependentGeneral Partners of the Partnership. Applicants believe that service asan Independent General Partner of the Partnership and MVP 1, a relationshipsimilar to one in which an individual serves as a director of multipleimvestment companies in the same complex, will be beneficial to the Partnershipand MVP 1.3. Applicants further request an exemption from section 2(a)(3)(D) of the1940 Act to the extent any Limited Partner owning less than 5% of the Unitsof the Partnership not be deemed an affiliated person of the Partnership,any other Limited Partner, or any of the General Partners solely by reasonof their status as Limited Partners. Since such Limited Partners have noexclusion under the 1940 Act comparable to that provided under sction 2(a)(3)of the 1940 Act to corporate shareholders with less than a 5% ownershipinterest, the requested relief will place investments in the Partnershipon a footing more equal with investments in business development companiesorganized as corporations.5. Applicants submit that exemptions from the provisions of sections 2(a)(19)and 2(a)(3)(D) are necessary and appropriate and in the public interestand consistent with the protection of investors and the purpose fairlyintended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:1. Applicants agree that the Partnership will be structured so that theIndependent General Partners of the Partnership and MVP 1, are the functionalequivalents of the non-interested directors of an incorporated investmentcompany registered under the 1940 Act.2. Under the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is authorized to makein-kind distributions of portfolio securities to its partners. Applicantsagree not to make any in-kind distributions of securities to partners ofthe Partnership until the Partnership has either obtained a ``no-action''letter from the staff of the SEC or, alternatively, has obtained an orderpursuant to Section 206A of the Advisers Act permitting such distribution.3. Applicants will obtain an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the IndependentGeneral Partners of the Partnership that the distributions and allocationsto the Managing General Partner can be paid in accordance with section205 of the Advisers Act. Applicants do not request SEC review or approvalof such opinion letter.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
