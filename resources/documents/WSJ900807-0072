The new models will be clustered at the low end of theAS/400 family, the consultants said. They will be easier touse than previous AS/400s, because IBM also plans tointroduce a new version of the minicomputer's operatingsystem.</LP><TEXT>   Since its introduction in 1988, the AS/400 has become arunaway success that contributes about $13 billion a year toIBM's revenue, producing more than $1 billion in profit,consultants said. Revenue from the product line increased 19%in 1989. In the first half of 1990, it grew at a double-digitrate again, IBM said last week, despite some analysts' fearsthat it had started to hit roadblocks.   Nonetheless, the low end of the family has consistentlyunderperformed IBM's higher-priced AS/400s. Thus, thismonth's announcement, which will include an entry-levelminicomputer priced in the $10,000 range, should cheerskeptics.   Consultants said the easy-to-use machines may help attractusers of a previous IBM minicomputer, the System/36. So far,System/36 users have resisted moving to the AS/400 becauseits operation is more complex and transferring software canbe difficult.   For these prospective customers, identified by consultantsas a potential $20 billion market, the new operating systemwill ease users through the more complex aspects of theAS/400. It also will make connecting to other computers,including non-IBM machines, easier.   For entry-level minicomputer users, IBM plans to offer anew version of its AS/Entry, a machine that uses System/36technology and is incompatible with the rest of the AS/400family. Unlike its predecessor, however, this computer looksthe same as other AS/400s, and can be upgraded to a regularAS/400 by replacing a few circuit boards.   IBM also will announce the availability of a speedy,high-capacity disk drive for all models of the AS/400. Thesenew drives will replace a slower drive that accounted for atleast $3 billion in revenue last year, said consultant DavidAndrews of ADM Inc., Cheshire, Conn.   The disk drive was announced in February for use in IBM'snew RS/6000 workstations. &quot;It's quite exciting technology,and it's very big business,&quot; said Mr. Andrews. Anothertechnological advance last seen in the RS/6000 -- thefour-megabit memory chip -- will also make its AS/400 debuton Aug. 21, he added.   An IBM spokeswoman confirmed that the Armonk, N.Y.,computer giant will make several AS/400 announcements thatwill focus on the low end &quot;in the very near future,&quot; butdeclined to give details.   In an interview last week, Robert LaBant, the new generalmanager of IBM's minicomputer operation, also refused to bespecific about the new products. But he and other IBMexecutives were unreservedly upbeat about the prospects forthe AS/400, which they said is now entering its &quot;growthphase.&quot;   &quot;We have tremendous demand,&quot; Mr. LaBant said. &quot;We're allworking overtime. . . . Demand is going to stay very high.&quot;   Mr. LaBant and the other executives sketched out animpressive first half for the AS/400, which they saidachieved double-digit growth in both revenue and units in theU.S. World-wide, the AS/400 recorded only single-digit unitgrowth, but revenue grew in double digits because sales wereskewed toward the high end. They added that in both the firstand second quarters, AS/400 shipments were&quot;supply-constrained,&quot; meaning machines weren't produced fastenough to fill orders.   Sales to sites with more than one AS/400 also have donewell, with the installed base doubling since September. Mr.LaBant said one customer -- identified by consultants asAllstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. -- isinstalling &quot;hundreds of AS/400s a month.&quot; An Allstatespokeswoman said she couldn't confirm the report.   Such numbers suggest the AS/400, which many analysts havepredicted will be outflanked by personal computers andworkstations such as the RS/6000, has a long way to go beforeit's declared dead.</TEXT></DOC>
