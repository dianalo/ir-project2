Traders blamed much of the setback on the dollar's gyrations in the foreign-exchange markets and an unexpected increase in some commodities prices. The dollar rose early in the day following a round of European interest-rate cuts but later sank amid reports that West German officials are disappointed with the recent U.S. budget deficit-cutting agreement.    &quot;The story of the day was the dollar and its quick turnaround,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;The bond market once again is tied to the dollar. When the dollar stumbled, the bond market tripped along with it.&quot;    Before the dollar began to drop, prices of some 30-year Treasury bonds were up by about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, from Monday's closing levels. However, they ended the day with declines of about 1 1/8 points, or around $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the largest one-day drop since Oct. 27, according to Peter Nicolescu, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc.    The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bonds rose to about 9%, the highest level in about three weeks and up from 8.89% Monday. But yields still are well below the 10 3/8% level that prevailed in mid-October, just before the stock market collapse of Oct. 19. The stock market's huge drop aroused fears of a recession and ignited an explosive rally in bond prices.    &quot;We've had a big rally recently, and so some kind of correction doesn't seem unusual here,&quot; said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers. &quot;I guess a lot of people think there is no hard, concrete evidence the economy is heading for a recession.&quot;    Mr. Coats said trading volume &quot;has been light all week&quot; and that dealers are &quot;trying to stay even&quot; in advance of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. &quot;I don't see the market suffering much more of a decline,&quot; he added.    West German officials are far from alone in expressing dissatisfaction with the U.S. budget accord reached last Friday between congressional and Reagan administration negotiators. Many U.S. investment managers and economists have greeted the accord with skepticism and even ridicule.    U.S. economic policy &quot;remains in a gridlock,&quot; contended H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Moseley Securities Corp. He is especially concerned about the Federal Reserve's credit policy. &quot;The Fed has reinstated the monetary freeze it imposed on the economy from April&quot; until late October, he charged. &quot;This increases the downside risk&quot; to the economy.    &quot;There is a growing realization that the easy-money kick everyone thought would bring a new milennium in the bond market has already ended, but it has ended more abruptly and violently than I thought likely,&quot; Mr. Heinemann said. &quot;I would think somehow the Fed would be able to find a happy medium between having money much too easy and much too tight.&quot;    Mr. Heinemann, in a recent report, said &quot;we doubt that the baby bull market in bonds can prosper for long.&quot; He also emphasized his concern about federal economic policies in the aftermath of the stock market collapse. &quot;In medical terms, America has had a major heart attack,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But the nation is still smoking, drinking and carrying on as if nothing had happened. It's plain that additional, far more serious warnings may be required before requisite actions can be taken.&quot;    Nonetheless, numerous analysts expect lower interest rates in coming weeks, mainly because they expect sluggish economic growth and low inflation in the aftermath of the stock market's tumultuous decline.    &quot;I think inflation over the next six months to a year is going to be very low, very quiet,&quot; said Donald Regan, the former White House chief of staff and Treasury secretary. In his weekly appearance on &quot;Before Hours,&quot; a television news program produced by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Regan predicted that inflation &quot;is not going to come roaring back like we had in the '79-'80-'81 period.&quot;    Mr. Regan also said he expects to see declines in the banking industry's prime lending rate, now 8 3/4%. The current level of the prime, or base, rate on corporate loans &quot;is ridiculous,&quot; Mr. Regan charged. &quot;The prime increases in halves and comes down in quarters. I think that it'll come down in quarters over the next several months as people see that this economy is not strong, we don't have inflation. There is no excuse for these high rates of interest.&quot;    Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover also expects lower interest rates over the next year, although he says a prime-rate cut &quot;isn't imminent.&quot; By the end of next year, he expects the prime rate to be &quot;at least one percentage point lower&quot; than it is now. He also expects a recession.    In the bond markets yesterday, the Treasury's latest 30-year issue was quoted late in the afternoon at a price of 98 20/32 to yield 9.01%. That compared with 99 25/32 late Monday.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds dropped about 13 1/2 points, its largest decline since Oct. 27 when it fell about 16 3/4 points. It closed yesterday at 1243.75 after ranging between 1243.44 and 1263.06.    The Treasury's latest 10-year notes fell to 99 22/32 late yesterday from 100 14/32 Monday, while the yield increased to 8.92% from 8.81%. But short-term interest rates were mixed.    The latest three-month Treasury bill rate rose to 5.78% bid from an average rate of 5.70% set at Monday's government auction. The latest six-month bill rate rose slightly to 6.13% bid from Monday's auction average of 6.11%. The federal funds rate, however, declined. The funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, averaged about 6 3/4% yesterday, down from Monday's average of 6.89%.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, a $100 million issue of Midlantic Corp. subordinated capital notes, due Dec. 1, 1999, was offered to investors through Morgan, Stanley andamp; Co. The 9 7/8% notes, which are noncallable, were priced yesterday at 99.818 to yield 9.901%, or 1.14 percentage points above comparable Treasury notes. The Midlantic notes are rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    In the municipal market, New York City sold $325 million of short-term notes yesterday in a two-part offering. It sold $225 million of revenue anticipation notes, or RANs, at an average net interest cost to the city of 5.85% plus $100 million of tax anticipation notes, or TANs, at an average net interest cost of 5.81%. Several underwriters late yesterday were reoffering the notes to investors at prices to yield 5.70%.    All the New York City notes are dated Dec. 3, 1987, and will come due on June 30 of next year. New York City oficials said four syndicates of underwriters won the competition for portions of the sale. A total of 11 syndicates submitted bids.    The U.S. Treasury yesterday sold about $7.51 billion of notes due in five years and two months. The average annual yield was 8.30%, down from 8.48% at the previous auction of similar notes Aug. 27. Here are details of the auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                                  5-year, 2-month    Applications                 $20,148,985,000    Accepted bids                 $7,505,335,000    Accepted at low price                    65%    Accepted noncompetitively       $291,000,000    Average price (Rate)           99.725(8.30%)    High price (Rate)              99.767(8.29%)    Low price (Rate)               99.684(8.31%)    Interest rate                         8 1/4%   The notes are dated Dec. 1 and mature Feb. 15, 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
