Wien says they may be in for a rough-and-tumble rideas the New Year begins.   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.14 to 539.84, a 0.03%gain, as volume fell to 176.8 million shares from 191.1million Tuesday. Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 1,108to 973, as 78 stocks dropped to new lows and 75 climbed tonew highs.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq index still looks dangerously overheated to Mr.Wien, although it has fallen about 3% from its all-time highof 556.17 reached last month. A 10-year chart of the indexillustrates &quot;eerie parallels&quot; with 1983, when OTC stocks lastpeaked, he says. Back then, smaller stocks rose sharply fromyear-earlier levels, only to fall steeply, Mr. Wien said inrecent comments to his clients.   With the Nasdaq Index more than 45% higher than a yearearlier, &quot;we now have a period that's comparable,&quot; he said inan interview. &quot;There may be some seeds of danger being sownhere.&quot; Mr. Wien cites another warning sign: the small-stockrally has been narrow, led by a few, larger stocks.   &quot;January will be a difficult month, and particularlydifficult for OTC stocks,&quot; Mr. Wien says. A bear sinceSeptember, he expects the Dow Jones Industrial Average tofall to 2700 in the next few months. Highflying small stocks,he adds, will fall the hardest, including somecomputer-related, biotechnology and medical stocks.   &quot;But we haven't said to bail out of OTC stocks,&quot; hequickly adds. He's advising clients to shop among stocks thathave recently drifted toward the low end of their 52-weektrading ranges, such as MCI Communications, Intel andHechinger.
