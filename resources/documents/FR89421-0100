Thestudy makes comparisons between speed distributions when a detectable radartransmission is present and when it is not. The authors of the report foundthat the data analyzed show an influence of radar detectors on trafficbehavior when radar is present. They conclude that this influence can havea negative impact on speed enforcement, but caution that definitive conclusionsabout the larger issue of the relationship between detectors and trafficsafety require resolution of serious methodological issue. The opinions,findings and recommendations contained in the report are those of the authors,V.J. Pezoldt and R.Q. Brackett, and do not necessarily represent thoseof NHTSA. Prior to the issuance of the final report, NHTSA received an inquiry aboutthis study and a request to make comments. In response to this request,agency decided to solicit comments from the general public. The commentswill become part of the public record and will assist the agency in reachinga decision on whether or not to embrace the findings of the draft report.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>23 U.S.C. 403; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: April 18, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Diane K.
