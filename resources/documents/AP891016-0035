The government freed Sisulu and seven other aging anti-apartheidleaders at dawn Sunday and the seven who belong to the AfricanNational Congress held the guerrilla movement's first newsconference in South Africa since it was banned in 1960.   ``Our determination has never been weakened by our long years ofimprisonment,'' said Sisulu, a former ANC secretary general and thecountry's best-known black leader after the still-imprisoned NelsonMandela.   Some among the hundreds of ANC supporters packing the churchhall where the news conference was held wept as the freedprisoners, raising clenched fists, led them in singing ``God BlessAfrica,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement.   Sisulu said the seven, aged 60 to 80, were confident they wouldlive to see ``a government that includes blacks ... a democraticmethod where a black man can become president, or a white man canbecome president.''   Today, newspapers across the political spectrum said the releasehad ushered in a new era that will be full of dramatic change anduncertainty.   ``The country enters a new phase in its history,'' thepro-government Citizen said in an editorial. ``But it is not goingto be an easy transition ... (and) nobody knows what kind of newcountry will emerge.''   The Sowetan, the country's largest black-oriented daily,cautioned that the freed black leaders face a daunting task: ``thatof uniting the democratic forces in this country and transformingit into a non-racial democracy.''   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, concurred.   ``This is only the start of a long and complex process,'' wroteeditor Ken Owen. ``What is said by Sisulu and his colleagues thisweek will be as important for creating a negotiating climate asPresident (F.W.) de Klerk's bold move in ordering their freedom.''   De Klerk announced the unconditional release of the eightTuesday as part of his attempt to improve conditions fornegotiating a new constitution that will extend political rights toblacks.   But he envisions some arrangement under which whites wouldretain veto power over major decisions. Under apartheid, the blackmajority has no voice in national affairs.   The releases are viewed as tacit acknowledgement by thegovernment of the ANC's influence and popularity.   Sisulu, 77, told the news conference that he had felt pressurebuilding for his release and ``that sooner or later they would haveto give in ... It was not possible to despair because the spirit ofthe people outside was too great.''   Even relatively conservative black leaders have said they willreject any negotiations with the government unless the ANC islegalized and its jailed leaders freed.   Sisulu and his colleagues said the ANC, the largest groupfighting the white-led government, will continue its militarycampaign and reject negotiations until the government legalizes it,lifts the 3-year-old state of emergency and releases all politicalprisoners.   ``If the government doesn't meet our demands, we have noalternative but to continue to fight for our freedom,'' said AndrewMlangeni, 63.   The ex-prisoners, seated in front of a large green, gold andblack ANC flag at the news conference, also said they would pressfor Mandela's release.   ``There can be no real joy about our release when we think ofthe comrades we left behind,'' Sisulu said.   Mandela, 71, is widely expected to be released in the next fewmonths. But there is speculation he does not want to go free untilthe government takes further steps to legalize ANC politicalactivity.   Five of the ANC men, including Sisulu and Mlangeni, werearrested in 1963 and sentenced to life prison terms in 1964, alongwith Mandela, for plotting anti-government sabotage.   The others freed Sunday were Elias Mostsoaledi, 65; AhmedKathrada, 60; Raymond Mhlaba, 68; Wilton Mkwayi, 67; and OscarMpetha, 80, who had been hospitalized in Cape Town and was thenation's oldest political prisoner.   The eighth man is 58-year-old Jafta Masemola of the outlawed PanAfricanist Congress, a smaller guerrilla group. He was convicted ofsabotage in 1963.   All except Mpetha had served at least 25 years.   The ANC seven spoke directly to their supporters after the newsconference. ``We are not the heroes. You are the heroes,'' saidKathrada.   At least 10,000 greeted Kathrada, an Indian, later Sunday nightwhen he arrived in the Lenasia, the main Indian township outsideJohannesburg.   The ANC leaders said they would seek passports to travel to theANC's exile headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, to consult with theircolleagues.</TEXT></DOC>
