Chairman Fred Carr, Michael R. Milken,a major accounting firm and three top rating concerns withfraud and other wrongdoing that allegedly contributed to thecollapse of Executive Life Insurance Co. in April.   First Executive, led by Mr. Carr, was part of a &quot;vastintertwined financial network&quot; of companies and otherentities controlled by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Mr.Milken, the convicted junk-bond king, the complaint filed instate court charged. Mr. Milken and others in this networkallegedly influenced or controlled the investment decisionsof First Executive's former Los Angeles-based Executive Lifeunit, including its massive purchases of high-risk,high-yield junk bonds.</LP><TEXT>   Deloitte andamp; Touche, outside auditor for both Executive Lifeand First Executive, and the insurance rating services ofA.M. Best Co., Moody's Investors Service Inc., and Standard andamp;Poor's Corp. were also charged with fraud and negligence.   The &quot;Drexel daisy chain&quot; was &quot;a mechanism used to takesavings investment from unaware people all over this nationand funnel them into the junk-bond kingdom of MichaelMilken,&quot; California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendisaid in a news conference announcing the suit, filed here.&quot;Mr. Carr was part of {the} inner circle.&quot;   Mr. Carr didn't return telephone calls to his Los Angelesoffice. First Executive, former parent of Executive Life,sought bankruptcy-law protection last May. Mr. Milken'sspokesman declined to comment. Mr. Milken, who pleaded guiltyto six securities-related crimes in 1990, is serving a10-year sentence at Federal Prison camp in Pleasanton, Calif.   An Sandamp;P spokeswoman said the New York-based rating concernhasn't seen the complaint, but that the allegations againstit are &quot;without merit.&quot; A spokesman for A.M. Best, Oldwick,N.J., &quot;categorically denied&quot; the charges.   Deloitte andamp; Touche said in a statement that it couldn'tcomment directly on the suit because the firm hasn't seen ityet. However, &quot;we know of no legitimate basis for such acomplaint against Deloitte andamp; Touche.&quot;   Moody's didn't return a phone call.   The lawsuit names six other First Executive and Drexelexecutives in addition to Mr. Carr and Mr. Milken.   According to an individual familiar with the suit, it wastimed to in part assure that Mr. Garamendi would get &quot;a seatat the table&quot; where Mr. Milken's attorneys are negotiating amassive $1.3 billion settlement of civil suits broughtagainst him and others by Drexel, investors, and thriftregulators. One of the lead law firms representing plaintiffsin the settlement, Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach,is among the firms that filed the California regulator'ssuit.   &quot;We're suing for full recovery of money lost; how much weactually get depends on how much there is,&quot; Mr. Garamendisaid at the news conference. The commissioner said he hopesto recover &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars.&quot;   Under terms of a proposed $3.55 billion purchase of thefailed insurer by a French investor group, Executive Lifepolicyholders with contracts valued above $100,000 now standto receive 72 cents on the dollar. Policyholders with smallercontracts will receive the full amount. The purchase, byAltus Finance, a subsidiary of the French bank CreditLyonnais, was approved by a state court in December and isexpected to be completed in a couple of months.   Deloitte andamp; Touche played a &quot;central role&quot; in illegal actsleading to Executive Life's demise and &quot;became the auditor ofchoice of the daisy chain,&quot; the suit said. The accountingfirm issued &quot;clean&quot; opinions of Executive Life and FirstExecutive, thus furthering the &quot;illusion&quot; that they hadsufficient financial resources to issue and/or purchaseDrexel-sponsored securities.   Deloitte responded, &quot;Executive Life's investment strategyand the details of its investment portfolio were fullydisclosed and well known to the California Department ofInsurance since Executive Life's inception.&quot;   Mr. Garamendi criticized Deloitte andamp; Touche's formerpartner in charge of the 1990 First Executive audit, WilliamL. Sanders, for giving the company a &quot;clean&quot; audit and thenjoining the company as chief financial officer. Mr. Sanders,a defendant in the suit, couldn't be reached.   Mr. Garamendi also said the rating concerns had aresponsibility to &quot;accurately portray the financialconditions of the company; we believe they did not do so, sothey like others share in the responsibility for theExecutive Life debacle.&quot;   The suit is the first filed by the California InsuranceDepartment against Mr. Carr, Deloitte andamp; Touche and the ratingagencies in connection with Executive Life's failure, adepartment spokesman said. The agency previously filedvarious allegations against Mr. Milken. Mr. Carr and otherexecutive of First Executive are also named in variousclass-action policyholder lawsuits.   Other individuals named in the regulators' California suitare Douglas F. Marcian, former manager of First Executive andExecutive Life's investment portfolio; George I. Rosenthal, aformer First Executive director; and Merle A. Horst, formerFirst Executive vice president and chief financial officer.   On the Drexel side, other named defendants were Mr.Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, a Drexel senior vicepresident, and Roy Johnson, Drexel's account executive toFirst Executive.   Mr. Rosenthal's attorney in Los Angeles, Skip Miller, saidthe charges against his client are &quot;totally without merit&quot;and are an attempt to coerce Mr. Rosenthal out of severalvaluable real-estate partnerships with Executive Life.   Mr. Marcian and Mr. Horst declined to comment. The otherdefendants couldn't be reached.</TEXT></DOC>
