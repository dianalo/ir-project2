Mrs. Whitmire and Hofheinz, who held the top city job in the mid1970s, were the most prominent contenders in the non-partisanelection that included five others on the ballot.   Also vying for the mayor's seat were Rosie Walker, 48, abusinesswoman; Greg Rosenberg, 23, a machinist running with theSocialist Party, Ted G. Walker, 54, an attorney; Shelby Oringderff,71, a retired pastor and teacher; and James Lee Kelley, 33, a realestate agent.   Polls taken in the final week before the election showed Mrs.Whitmire pulling away from Hofheinz and holding a comfortable 59percent to 15 percent lead with about 20 percent of the votersundecided.</TEXT><TEXT>   The election marked the second time Mrs. Whitmire, 43, faced aformer mayor. In 1985, she trounced Louie Welch, whose mayorallongevity record she is trying to match.   In her most recent election two years ago, Mrs. Whitmire _ anaccountant by trade and the first woman elected in a citywide racewhen she won the controller's job in 1978 _ won her fourth two-yearterm against token opposition.   Hofheinz's father was colorful Harris County Judge Roy Hofheinz,the prime mover behind building of the Houston Astrodome.   Mrs. Whitmire and Hofheinz, a 51-year-old lawyer, engaged innumerous debates throughout the campaign, with Hofheinz chargingthat the incumbent had become complacent in office, lost track offederal money, rewarded supporters with city contracts and lost thesupport of the police department.   Mrs. Whitmire accused her opponent of mudslinging and criticizedhis record as mayor.   Mrs. Whitmire took office at the height of the oil boom, butthen had to deal with declining revenues and a shattered economywhen oil prices collapsed. She touted her handling of city financesthrough the tough times and boasted that unemployment, which peakedat some 13 percent, is now around 5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
