Now, 13 years later, he's a high-priced Washington lawyer who makes a lot of money advising clients about the case.    &quot;I never in my wildest moments thought we would end up with this ongoing proceeding,&quot; Mr. Verveer says.    There's big money being made from the breakup of the phone system. While American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and its offspring have had losses of more than $1 billion on new ventures, hundreds of Washington lawyers mine the ATandamp;T case like a vein of gold. Among the most prominent prospectors are former Justice Department officials, whose new roles raise ethical questions.    The case &quot;is giving the Justice Department fits,&quot; says Jay Shaffer, a former Justice Department ethics officer.    Many people may assume that the ATandamp;T case ended in January 1984, when ATandamp;T spun off seven regional phone companies. Far from it. As part of the consent decree ordering the breakup, federal Judge Harold Greene allowed the regional phone companies to apply to the court for permission to enter new businesses and invited phone company competitors to oppose such moves.    That ruling saved a booming Washington business. In the decade before the breakup, ATandamp;T estimates that it spent $380 million in legal fees. In the three years since the breakup, according to a variety of estimates, the regional companies, their allies and opponents have probably spent $75 million for lawyers and consultants working on the decree.    There isn't any end in sight. Judge Greene is considering a Justice Department proposal to let the phone companies enter manufacturing, computerized services and long-distance. More than 100 companies and trade associations have filed comments on that plan, toting up legal fees of about $5 million. Whatever the judge decides, lawyers will prosper, arguing consent-decree issues before Judge Greene, Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory authorities.    &quot;For the legal profession, the breakup of ATandamp;T has been like receiving an unsolicited annuity,&quot; says Kenneth Robinson, a Commerce Department telecommunications official. Says David Sather, counsel for U S West Inc., a regional phone company: &quot;I don't mind putting their (lawyers') kids through school, but I draw the line at their grandchildren.&quot;    Federal statutes bar former Justice Department officials who worked on the ATandamp;T case from ever working on the case again as private attorneys either in court or in dealings with the Justice Department. But former Justice Department lawyers have figured out ways around the prohibition.    John Shenefield was the antitrust chief from 1977 to 1980 and oversaw the ATandamp;T case. Last year, as an attorney for a cellular-telephone company, he reentered the case to urge Judge Greene to block Pacific Telesis Group, a regional phone company, from acquiring a rival cellular-telephone concern.    &quot;Everybody went ape,&quot; says Kenneth Anderson, who was the Justice Department's lead attorney in the ATandamp;T case under Mr. Shenefield. But Mr. Shenefield argues that the statutes don't apply to him because the ATandamp;T case effectively ended with divestiture and has become akin to an administrative proceeding.    When Mr. Shenefield appeared before Judge Greene, the Justice Department favored his interpretation, but no longer. &quot;If they (lawyers) participated personally and substantively in the ATandamp;T litigation, they can't appear before us and the court,&quot; says Roger Andewelt, deputy assistant attorney general.    Mr. Verveer, who instigated the ATandamp;T suit, appeared regularly last year for a client before a Justice Department consultant and he was ready to argue his client's case before Judge Greene this year. But he backed off when Justice changed its mind. Still, he says he can do such &quot;back room&quot; work as advising clients about the consent decree, and writing and reviewing pleadings.    Kevin Sullivan, the Justice Department's lead attorney overseeing the consent decree between 1984 and 1986, left to work for Pillsbury, Madison andamp; Sutro, which represents Pacific Telesis. While he was job hunting, he acknowledges, he gave speeches arguing that the regional companies should be free to enter markets banned to them under the consent decree.    Henry Geller, who was the Federal Communications Commission's general counsel from 1964 to 1970 and is currently director of Duke University's Washington Center for Public Policy, argues that Mr. Sullivan's actions raise at least the &quot;appearance&quot; of a conflict of interest. But Mr. Sullivan replies that he doesn't work on the consent decree at Pillsbury Madison, or receive any money from Pacific.    Another role reversal involves former antitrust chief William Baxter, the man most responsible for breaking up ATandamp;T. Mr. Baxter now consults for U S West, which wants to become a mini-ATandamp;T, free to enter all its markets. He says he gives university speeches boosting the regional companies, advises U S West on how to reconstruct its network, and recently represented the company at a meeting of securities analysts in Vail, Colo.    Although he says he steers clear of direct involvement in the consent decree, he realizes that his advice on the network may figure prominently in Judge Greene's decision. &quot;It could wind up in the court,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
