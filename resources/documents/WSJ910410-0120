The commission's rules carry out a law passed last year toprevent abuses in operator-services business, an industrythat was opened to competition after the 1984 divestiture ofthe Bell System. The legislation was aimed at preventingcompanies from charging consumers unreasonable rates -- whichare often two to three times higher than those of establishedlong-distance carriers -- and preventing them from placingcalls through the long-distance carrier of their choice.</LP><TEXT>   Excessive bills for long-distance calls placed throughalternative services have been a constant source ofcomplaints at the FCC for years. As a reaction to consumeroutrage, many hotels and airports have been rethinking howmuch of a commission they should be drawing from phone calls.   The new rules -- which cover the telephone operatorservices as well as hotels, airports, pay-phone owners andothers who control phones used by the public -- require theservices to provide specific information to ensure thatconsumers know what phone service they are using.Information, including the name, address and toll-free numberfor the operator service and the name and address of theFCC's enforcement division, must be posted on or near thephone.   In addition, they require the operator service to identifyitself clearly at the beginning of a call, before any chargesare incurred. Consumers will be able to hang up before theconnection is made without being charged. Information onrates, collection and complaint policies also must bedisclosed.   If a hotel, airport or other public facility has acontract with one particular operator service, it can't blocka caller from using other long-distance services such asAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., MCI Communications Corp.or United Telecommunications Inc.'s US Sprint Communicationsunit.   Separately, the commission proposed allowing long-distancecarriers access to local telephone companies' credit-cardvalidation data and billing information. The local phonecompanies would be allowed to charge a fee for the services.   The proposal was tied to an investigation of CincinnatiBell Telephone Co., which had provided calling-cardverification only to ATandamp;T. The commission said the CincinnatiBell Inc. unit should make its calling-card data available toall long-distance carriers.</TEXT></DOC>
