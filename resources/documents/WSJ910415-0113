The Kurds, the Soviet Georgians and other peoples wholack seats in the United Nations, need not apply.</LP><TEXT>   That policy assures that if the U.S.S.R. breaks up,Americans can expect replays of the moral dilemma now playingout in Iraq. This isn't likely to be the last time the U.S.stands by while a central government it doesn't like crushesan independence movement that has captured American publicsympathy.   Secretary of State James Baker has said repeatedly that --except for the three small Baltic republics, whoseincorporation into the Soviet Union the U.S. specificallyrefused to recognize -- &quot;the United States has recognized theboundaries of the Soviet Union since 1933.&quot;   &quot;Our policy is that we don't favor the breakup of theSoviet Union,&quot; except for the independence of the Baltics,explains a senior administration official. &quot;We have onepolicy for the U.S.S.R., for Canada, Yugoslavia,Czechoslovakia -- all the countries that are threatening tobreak up. And that is that we'd like to see them staytogether.&quot;   It is clearer than ever that the principal legalunderpinning of the new era envisioned by the White House issovereignty, not democracy or human rights. The latterconcepts do help shape U.S. policy, but the bedrock of thepolicy is the &quot;inviolability of borders,&quot; as was laid out forEurope by the 1975 Helsinki accords.   That code of behavior was meant to stop armed aggressionby countries seeking to alter recognized borders or removestates from the map altogether.   But the principle has a dark side as well. It means thatancient nationalities such as the Kurds, who haven't achievedstatehood by now, won't get U.S. help in reversing oldannexations and conquests, no matter how unfair. Despite itslofty rhetoric, the Bush administration has chosen stabilityover &quot;self-determination.&quot;   That stance could put the U.S. into awkward diplomaticfixes. It isn't hard, for instance, to envision MikhailGorbachev citing the &quot;inviolability&quot; of the U.S.S.R.'sborders and asking Mr. Bush to join him in condemning anarmed secession fight by a restive Soviet republic.   Many in Congress agree that backing independence for everyethnic group that wants it would mean chaos in country aftercountry. &quot;You really have to deal with nation states as theyexist,&quot; says Democratic congressman Steny Hoyer, who chairsthe U.S. commission that monitors the Helsinki accords. &quot;In ahard-headed way, we have little alternative to sovereignty,because of the incredible difficulty of sorting out claimsonce you get beyond sovereign nations.&quot;   In Yugoslavia alone, he notes, there are conflictingclaims between the central government, the componentrepublics, smaller ethnic regions and bordering countries.   There are limits, of course, to this U.S. emphasis onsovereignty. Mr. Bush wouldn't send troops to defend theborders of every U.N. member, especially those lacking oil orsome other feature deemed &quot;vital&quot; to American interests.   The administration some day conceivably could considerPalestinians serious claimants to nationhood. One reason isthat Palestinians enjoy a special legal status: The U.N. oncevoted to create a Palestinian Arab state next to Israel(Arabs spurned the deal).   And Rep. Hoyer notes that the Helsinki accords and U.S.policy still give strong weight to the status of ethnicminorities. They call for governments to give minoritieshuman rights through democratic governance, within existingborders. Pluralism, not separatism, is the U.S. watchword.   The Helsinki principles also permit the alteration ofborders by peaceful, democratic means -- provided theinvolved sovereign state agrees. Thus, the U.S. didn't opposethe mutually accepted merger of the two Yemens and probablywould bless a peaceful unification of Korea.   American officials are telling Soviet separatists -- evenBaltic leaders whose independence claims the U.S. regards aslegally unassailable -- that they must negotiate their wayout of Moscow's clutches. &quot;The way out of the Soviet Unionleads through Moscow,&quot; says a top U.S. official.</TEXT></DOC>
