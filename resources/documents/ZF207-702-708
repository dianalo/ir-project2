And thedifferences aren't necessarily what you'd expect.andP;  A program can have aweakness - such as an inability to read dot-matrix characters accurately -even though it does well on most other types of characters.andM;The programs differ in many other ways: what file formats they can save datato, how quickly they work, what control they provide over the scanning andrecognition processes, and whether they let you edit the file in the OCRprogram.andP;  The trainable programs differ in training methods and in theirlibraries of trained fonts (they come equipped to read some common types).andO;OCR programs can even differ on what kinds of files they can work on.andO;Although they all work on a graphic image as it comes from a scanner, theydon't all work with all scanners.andP;  Some don't even need a scanner; they canwork from TIFF or other graphics files - good news for fax modem owners.andM;Don't assume that the automatic programs are the best.andP;  Although you canlearn to use them faster, they demand more hardware than the trainables do.andO;And the trainable programs can be adapted to work relatively quickly andaccurately with particular documents.andP;  If you have only a few document stylesthat you need to read a lot or if you have one extremely long document, atrainable program can be faster and more accurate than an automatic one.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
