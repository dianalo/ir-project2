In this paper, first of all, the performance and theessential operational parameters are characterized. Next, the presentstate of process modelling, performance of pilot tests as well as scale-upand process control are briefly discussed. Industrial applications arepresented and, finally, new concepts and design variations of the equipmentare considered.</TEXT></DOC>
