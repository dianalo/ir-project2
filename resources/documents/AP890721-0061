Tamil rebels have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominatedgovernment for six years. Violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed toa plan to grant regional autonomy to Tamils has left more than 470people dead in recent weeks, the government said Thursday.   Ratnasabapathy was among 13 members of the opposition partyelected to the 225-seat Parliament. The 13th did not attend today'ssession, colleagues said, because he could not arrive on time. Theydid not elaborate.   The opposition party, known as EROS, won its seats in the Feb.15 general election. The legislators boycotted the session,demanding the government release Tamil political prisoners, holdpeace talks with the most militant guerrillas and abolish anamendment to the constitution requiring lawmakers to take an oathdisavowing the division of the island along ethnic lines.   Ratnasabapathy said the group was satisfied the government metmost of its demands.   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government opened peace talkswith the Tamil Tigers on May 4, the first direct contact since theinsurgency began six years ago, and ordered the release of hundredsof Tamil political prisoners. The constitutional amendment,however, was not abolished.   EROS is widely believed to be closely linked with the LiberationTigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest and most militant of the Tamilgroups waging a campaign for a separate nation in the north andeast.   Ratnasabapathy and the other EROS members joined Parliament asit was debating whether to extend the state of emergency imposed amonth ago to try to curb ethnic violence. ``Emergency laws are notgoing to solve any problems of the people. The government will haveto use democratic methods to bring about a solution,'' he said.   The emergency laws had been in effect from 1983 until January1989, when Premadasa took office and lifted the state of emergency.But the killings continued, and the emergency was reimposed June 20.   Sinhalese radicals trying to overthrow the government killed 472people in recent weeks, despite a tough new crackdown by securityforces, an official said. Vincent Perrera, minister forparliamentary affairs, said Thursday that the killings occurredfrom June 21 to July 15.   Most deaths since July 6 had not been previously reportedbecause of government censorship of news reports. In addition tocensorship, the government gave security forces sweeping powers,including shoot-on-sight orders, to quell the radical movement.   Perrera also said that 70 people were killed in theTamil-dominated north and east during the same period. He did notname the suspected assailants.   Sinhalese militants operate mainly in the center and south ofthe island.   Tamil rebels began fighting for a separate country in 1983,prompting the start of the emergency laws.   In 1987, the Sinhalese-dominated government offered the rebelslimited autonomy in exchange for a surrender of arms, but theTigers rejected the plan and began fighting Indian soldiers who hadbeen sent to enforce it.   The agreement also caused a backlash from Sinhalese hard-linerswho began attacking the government, saying it was giving too manyconcessions to the minority Tamils. The two conflicts have left atleast 15,000 people dead.</TEXT></DOC>
