This is soimportant that to get an advance peek, some newsorganizations agreed not to check her allegations beforepublishing them. Others swallowed the bait without signing upearly.   Another great issue of the day is, whether the 1980election was stolen from Jimmy Carter by the Reagan campaignbribing the ayatollah to keep the hostages. Gary Sick, whopeddled this one to the New York Times, says he hasn't madeup his mind whether George Bush, the vice presidentialcandidate in that election, snuck away in the last weeks ofthe campaign to connive in Paris.</LP><TEXT>   Another great issue of the day is whether newsorganizations should withhold the name of the woman who saidshe was raped at the Kennedy mansion in Palm Beach, or is&quot;outing&quot; her even more politically correct? And another greatissue is whether John Sununu reimbursed the government forprivate travel on military planes, and if so how much?   These are empty scandals, to different degrees momentarilyinteresting but of no lasting moment to the Republic. You canalmost long for the real thing, a scandal with legs, one thatreally ought to be explored and resolved in the interest ofour future. And we're starting to suspect that one suchscandal is brewing in the secret ownership of the largestbank in Washington, D.C., by a large but shadowy Arab bank.   Last month the Federal Reserve ordered theLuxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International tosell its stake in Washington's First American Bankshares. InTampa last year, a unit of BCCI pleaded guilty to launderingdrug money; five of its officials were sentenced to jail,including one who had served as personal banker to ManuelNoriega. BCCI has long attracted the attention of bankingregulators around the world, sometimes being described as abank that's &quot;offshore everywhere.&quot; BCCI's founder, Agha HasanAbedi, is seriously ill, a number of other executives havebeen fired, and the bank is being reorganized by Sheik Zayedal-Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi.   Clark Clifford, chairman of First American and also BCCI'sprincipal American attorney, says he was misled on theownership issue. Mr. Clifford is of course a longtime adviserto Democratic Presidents, while First American PresidentRobert Altman is one of his law partners at Clifford andamp; Warnkewho runs in Republican circles. They had repeatedly assuredbanking authorities over First American's ownership, sayingthat some of its owners also held stakes in BCCI, but thatthe two were in fact independent. Manhattan District AttorneyRobert Morgenthau uncovered the ownership issue in an ongoinginvestigation of money laundering.   This scandal has attracted some media attention, notablyfrom Peter Truell and others in our Washington bureau, aswell as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and Regardie's magazine. But itcertainly has not attained Kitty Kelley status, though wereally ought to know how far a money-laundering bank has gonein buying its way into America.   Pretty far, perhaps, to judge by the new revelations byElizabeth Kurylo of the Atlanta Constitution. She reportsthat Mr. Abedi, through BCCI, was one of two big contributorsto Jimmy Carter's Global 2000 project, founded to improvehealth and agriculture in Asia and Africa. Mr. Abedi also wasa big contributor to the Carter Presidential library, andfurnished the BCCI jet for the former President's use.   The other big contributor to Global 2000 is alsointeresting: Japanese gambling king and charity mogul RyoichiSasakawa. Mr. Sasakawa headed an ultranationalist movementduring World War II and was jailed for three years as a warcrimes suspect but ultimately released without being charged.Required by Japanese law to devote some of his gamblingprofits to public purposes, he has generously funded goodworks at home and abroad, while building associations withworld leaders. The Constitution reports he has alsocontributed to enterprises sponsored by Richard Nixon andCoretta Scott King. He also has ties with the UnificationChurch, and to organizations listed as contributors to theNicaraguan contras.   Funds controlled by Mr. Sasakawa and Mr. Abedi, theConstitution reports, accounted for more than $19 million ofthe $23.4 million received by the Global 2000 project.Another $2.5 million was given by the Abu Dhabi InvestmentAuthority to make good on BCCI pledges made under Mr. Abedi.In response to the Constitution's inquiries, Mr. Carter'sfund-raiser defended Mr. Sasakawa as a philanthropist, andsaid BCCI had a good reputation when the contributionsstarted. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the formerPresident.   President Carter, it seems, met Mr. Abedi through BertLance. When Mr. Lance resigned as budget director, Mr. Abedihired him as a consultant. When Mr. Lance had to sell hisNational Bank of Georgia to meet his debts, it was purchasedby a BCCI client and sometime shareholder, Ghaith Pharaon.Senator John Kerry has written the Federal Reserve to pointout that key former executives are playing an important partin the recent reorganization of BCCI; he wonders whether therestructuring is merely &quot;damage control.&quot;   While the BCCI associations that have come to lightconcern mostly Democrats, Republicans have no grounds forcomplacency. As the party controlling the executive branch,indeed, they should be worried anyone may have beenunwittingly compromised -- a far more important matter thanMr. Sununu's plane flights. For while we've been distractedby Kitty Kelley and the like, it seems apparent, shadowyinfluences have been trying to buy their way into Americanlife.</TEXT></DOC>
