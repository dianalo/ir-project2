With the 285-120 vote, the House sent its version of the bill to a conference committee with the Senate, which approved a comparable measure earlier. Lawmakers said the swift action by both houses indicates that Congress may clear the first separate housing-aid bill in nearly seven years.    Despite the lopsided vote, bolstered by several dozen Republicans, the Reagan administration has threatened to veto the bill as too costly. The Congressional Budget Office's most recent cost estimate of $15.9 billion -- essentially holding programs at current levels plus an adjustment for inflation -- is nearly $5 billion more than the administration requested for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.    But the bill also contains several proposals long sought by the administration or GOP members of the housing panel. For example, the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage-insurance program wouldn't have to be reauthorized. The popular program was interrupted six times last year for a total of 51 days because Congress failed to extend it.    The measure also includes a limited version of so-called enterprise zones to revive depressed areas, provides for the sale of public housing units to their low-income tenants under certain conditions, and eliminates the need for reauthorization of the administration's &quot;voucher&quot; program. The latter program grants an allowance to poor families to purchase housing where they choose instead of tying the subsidy to a particular building.    But the measure also would thwart many of the Reagan administration's recent efforts to reduce the federal role in housing. For example, the bill would:    --Ban user fees for programs run by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., two federally sponsored corporations in the secondary mortgage market.    --Prohibit the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees Freddie Mac, from imposing any restrictions on Freddie Mac's level of business.    --Require that the FHA continue to finance closing costs for homeowners who so desire. It also would raise the maximum mortgage limit under the FHA program to $101,250 from the current $90,000.    --Create the first new assisted housing program since 1983, the so-called Nehemiah program, which encourages homeownership for low-income families by offering interest-free second mortgages for houses built in poor neighborhoods.    The Senate bill contains many provisions contained in the House measure, such as FHA reauthorization and the Nehemiah program. But it is a two-year bill and avoids many of the House's agency directives. </TEXT></DOC>
