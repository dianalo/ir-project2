SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department said Wednesday it regretsa lack of progress in informal peace talks on Cambodia and called onVietnam and authorities in Phnom Penh to make a ``major effort toaddress seriously the remaining issues'' including formation of aninterim government.   President Bush is expected to take up the Cambodia matter in histalks this weekend with the Chinese in Beijing, said departmentspokesman Charles E. Redman, who spoke as Bush began a trip toJapan, China and South Korea.   Redman, declining to offer details of Bush's planned discussions,was asked to comment on the end of the latest round of informalpeace talks among factions seeking power in Cambodia.   The talks deadlocked over formation of a provisional governmentto rule in Phonm Pen until elections can be held, and littleprogress was made on establishing a timetable for ending theVietnamese occupation.   The Chinese supply military aid to the Khmer Rouge, the largestfaction in a three-party opposition coalition battling theVietnamese-supported government. The United States suppliesnon-lethal aid the two non-communist factions in the coalition _followers of former head of state Prince Sihanouk, and the KhmerPeople's National Liberation Front of Son Sann.   Through Hanoi, Moscow supports Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.   ``We regret that more progress was not made at the second Jakartainformal meeting toward achieving an acceptable and comprehensivesettlement,'' Redman said of the peace talks, held in Indonesia.   Redman called on Vietnam and the authorities in Phnom Penh ``tomake a major effort to address seriously the remaining issues,particularly the formation of an interim government precedingelections in Cambodia and the participation of an internationalpresence sufficiently strong to carry out its duties in support of asettlement.''   While Redman did not define what he meant by ``an internationalpresence,'' there have been calls for an international peacekeepingforce to oversee the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.   He said the United States supports a ``comprehensive agreement''to ensure a lasting solution in Cambodia.   He argued that Sihanouk's role was ``crucial as leader of aninterim government preceding elections and as the focus for nationalunity.''   Redman restated U.S. support for the ``verified and complete''withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces, effective safeguards against aKhmer Rouge return to power, and restoration of genuineself-determination to the Cambodian people.   He said the United States is involved in ``close, active, andregular consultations'' regarding a Cambodian settlement with theSoviet Union, China, the governments of the Association of SoutheastAsian Nations, and the non-communist opposition groups.   ``We are prepared to support those practical and reasonablemeasures which will help achieve the goal of a free, independent,and peaceful Cambodia,'' Redman said.   Cambodian guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son ofPrince Sihanouk, has called for the United States to become moreinvolved in the negotiations to end the conflict in Cambodia.   Ranariddh also has told reporters that he believes the impasseover Cambodia may only be broken after the May summit in Beijingbetween Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chinese leader DengXiaoping.</TEXT></DOC>
