Nowhere else has so much of life been broken up into &quot;issues,&quot; with organized proponents striving to push their causes to the top of the political agenda. In this toughest of competitions, the 1980s has probably seen no greater success story than &quot;the homeless&quot; issue.    Bills pending before Congress propose to spend up to $4 billion on the homeless. After a state court decision mandating care for the homeless, New York City's cost for homeless programs escalated from $6.8 million in 1978 to $156 million in 1986, even as the economy has improved. With 3,600 homeless families living in below-standard hotels at an average cost of $1,900 a month, the city last month agreed to build 16 more shelters to handle the &quot;crisis.&quot;    One of the great advantages the homeless issue had that other issues often lack is that most politicians unhesitatingly accepted all its advocates' claims as true. It is surely true that there are people who have been driven from their homes for a variety of reasons and for whom day-to-day life has become extremely difficult. But there is strong evidence that the homeless &quot;crisis&quot; as it is popularly represented to the public is being exaggerated.    For example, a new study by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, an advocacy group for the poor, warns that the number of homeless in the U.S. will rise from some three million today to 18.7 million by the year 2003. How are such frightening numbers arrived at? Martin Wooster of Reason magazine has taken a thorough look at the basis for the widely used estimates of homelessness in the U.S.    &quot;Beyond anecdotes,&quot; he writes, &quot;the extraordinary claim of two to three million homeless rests on 'information' received from sources -- usually homeless activists -- in 25 cities and states. Their estimate 'lacks absolute statistical certainty,' they concede.&quot;    So for that matter does a 1984 Department of Housing and Urban Development study that found that the &quot;most reliable range is 250,000 to 350,000 homeless persons.&quot; Many of its estimates came from newspaper stories quoting homeless advocates.    The reliability of such estimates was called into question by a 1986 study for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency, which sought to actually count the number of homeless in the skid-row section of the city. Researchers found that between 1,650 and 2,285 homeless people stayed on skid row each night. However, soup-kitchen operators -- some of the sources that HUD relied upon -- told researchers that there were between 10,000 and 40,000 homeless people in the area.    Martha Hicks, president of the Skid Row Development Corp., a nonprofit community agency, scoffs at HUD's claim of up to 50,000 homeless people in Los Angeles. &quot;They'd be falling all over each other if we had that many here,&quot; she says.    Where real homelessness exists, the more important task is accurately identifying and fixing the flawed public-policy decisions that put some people onto the streets. There is now growing agreement, for instance, that many homeless people are former inmates of mental institutions who never should have been released. Last week, New York City joined six states in making it easier to involuntarily hospitalize homeless people who are incapable of taking care of themselves. Mayor Edward Koch, one of the first politicians who has summoned the courage to denounce the homeless lobby, attacked the organized opponents of such care as &quot;crazies.&quot;    Other people have been priced out of a housing market that has been distorted by poor public policy. The leading example is New York's 44-year-old rent-control laws, which have laid waste whole sections of the city and helped to create the homeless population. While 3,600 families sit in rundown hotels, the city owns more than 40,000 abandoned apartments. Absent rent control, much of this stock eventually could be reclaimed as low-income housing.    The homeless lobby's typical alternative is to spend more money on shelters. But building subsidized shelters is only likely to create greater numbers of individuals calling themselves homeless. The truly homeless deserve better than to be turned into another &quot;issue&quot; whose &quot;solutions&quot; ensure that it will never be solved. The task for the genuinely concerned is to provide the kind of economic incentives that will spur more housing construction and the maintenance of existing housing. </TEXT></DOC>
