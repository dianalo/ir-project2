As moppets watched, teen-age actor Scott Grimes explained that the deadly disease AIDS can't be caught by sharing pencils or schoolbooks.    Then it was on to Bugs Bunny.    Though many early-morning cartoon viewers range from two to eight years old, WXEX says they aren't too young for basic education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome. &quot;Kids are hearing the word 'AIDS' daily,&quot; explains Neva Snell, the station's assistant promotions manager. &quot;Why not let them know it isn't something they have to be afraid of?&quot;    But, like the airing of condom commercials to help combat the spread of the disease, the AIDS-education commercials for young children are sparking controversy. Some parents and child-care experts wonder what, if anything, cartoon-watchers make of the commercials, no matter how innocuous and well-meaning.    &quot;To introduce the concept of AIDS to children without a foundation would probably be frightening, inappropriate and not very successful,&quot; says Dr. Francis Palumbo, an associate professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University. &quot;They have got to know what it is before you can tell them how not to get it.&quot; AIDS public-service spots should be aired during programs directed at older children, he says.    Although no count is available, it appears that only a few stations now show AIDS-education spots during children's programs. But the number could increase sharply this summer -- after WNEV-TV in Boston, along with Action for Children's Television, finishes a new series of AIDS-education spots and programs.    Proponents insist that it is important for television to help educate children of all ages about AIDS -- to end fear of how it spreads and prejudice against victims. Though most victims are adults, 460 U.S. children under 13 have been diagnosed as having AIDS (including 291 who have already died), says the federal Centers for Disease Control. Medical authorities say some children with AIDS contracted it through transfusions of tainted blood; most caught AIDS at or near birth, from mothers infected with the virus.    Some children with AIDS have been ostracized by classmates, in part because of misconceptions that it can be spread by casual contact.    The AIDS commercials now aired during children's programs aren't sexually explicit; in fact, they don't mention how AIDS is transmitted. The commercials' proponents say it is enough to dispel myths -- by explaining how AIDS isn't transmitted.    William Gussner, the superintendent of schools in Wilmette, Ill., says he favors spots that provide children -- even pre-schoolers -- with basic information. He says myths were initially a problem at one Wilmette school when a child there was diagnosed as having AIDS.    &quot;For young people to be talking to other young people, saying you don't need to be afraid of a kid who has AIDS . . .. is good,&quot; says Holly Smith, the media-relations coordinator of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. &quot;That isn't talking about anal and vaginal intercourse. I don't think that's appropriate.&quot;    In the 30-second spot featuring Scott Grimes, the star of &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot; says: &quot;What does a kid know about AIDS? I know it's a serious disease that some kids have. But I'm not worried about getting AIDS from them, because you can't get AIDS from sharing pencils, schoolbooks or just by being around someone.&quot;    Officials at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which produced the commercial and has shown it during a Sunday-afternoon show about pets and during its &quot;Evening Magazine,&quot; think the spot is effective even though it isn't explicit, partly because it provides a telephone number that people can dial to get more AIDS information. Ms. Snell in Richmond adds that WXEX wouldn't have run the spot if it said that AIDS is sexually transmitted or that a person could die from the disease.    AIDS spots for children may become more explicit. WNEV in Boston hasn't yet scripted the AIDS spots it is producing, but they may involve cartoon characters and references to sex. &quot;Kids aren't dumb,&quot; says Dr. Alan Xenokis, the station's health expert. &quot;People who underestimate the curiosity and intelligence of children are making a sad mistake.&quot;    Viewers' responses to the less explicit AIDS spots now being run have been mixed. Neither KPIX nor WXEX has received any complaints. But five callers complained to WFXT-TV in Boston after the station -- by accident, it claims -- twice ran AIDS commercials during children's programs, including early-morning cartoons. &quot;Callers felt that children are too young for that subject,&quot; reports Linda Waring, WFXT's public-service director.    Some child-care experts agree that children under eight to 10 probably won't understand AIDS commercials. For those kids, says Dr. James Strain, the executive director of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a 30-second spot may raise more questions than it answers.    Even some people who favor more AIDS education wonder if TV commercials are effective. &quot;The kind of abstract thinking required to understand how AIDS works, spreads and can kill you is very sophisticated,&quot; says Dr. William Dietz, a pediatrician at New England Medical Center in Boston. He has tried to explain to his 10-year-old daughter how a condom offers protection. &quot;I'm still not sure it's something she really understands,&quot; he says.    Some other parents also have doubts, especially for younger children. Lynette Thomas, a Boston mother with a six-year-old son, says: &quot;At his age they don't even know about sex. They need to know more about their own bodies before they learn about other things like AIDS.&quot;    Still, Dr. Strain says 13- and 14-year-olds are mature enough to understand commercials explaining that AIDS can be transmitted by the exchange of body fluids during sexual intercourse and that the disease is more common among homosexuals. Dr. Palumbo suggests that commercials aimed at children aged 12 and up could mention AIDS as one consequence of promiscuity, without going into details about how one catches it.    Longer educational programs about AIDS -- either instead of or in addition to commercials -- may be more valuable, Drs. Strain and Palumbo say. For children over age 15, Dr. Palumbo says, programs could be more explicit about what causes AIDS. &quot;Here, you really are talking to people who know what's going on,&quot; he says. Still, he adds that he would begin such a show with a warning that the program contained sexually explicit information.    Another Richmond station, WWBT-TV, won't run AIDS commercials for young children, but station officials would consider late-night spots geared toward people over age 12. &quot;I understand they are in a substantially higher risk group for AIDS,&quot; explains John Hutchinson, the vice president and general manager.    But that approach also poses problems. Notes Michael Seagly, the operations manager at WZZM-TV in Grand Rapids, Mich.: &quot;It's very difficult to separate programs for teen-agers from programs for children.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
