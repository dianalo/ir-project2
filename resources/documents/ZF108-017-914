(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>dBASE and Clipper Tools Development time in dBASE is costly, and a packagethat can save even a few days' work will soon pay for itself.andP;  Softwarehouses have been quick to recognise a potential market for any language inwide use, and two quite different approaches are considered below.andP;  The firstaims to write much of the more tedious program code for you, while the secondtries to ease the headaches of designing reports.andM;UI ProgrammerandM;UI is an application generator.andP;  The user draws menus and data entry forms onthe screen, and the software then writes the code.andP;  That is the essence; inpractice there is a wide range of facilities and sophistication.andM;The package comprises a thick A5 ring manual and four disks.andP;  Installationcreates a directory structure comprising: \UI, the main 'editing\helpsoftware plus utilities for documentation and conversion from UI 1.0,\UI\TEM, template files, \UI\TLB, template library files, \UI\WW,user-designed applications in internal format and \UI\DBF, example data filesand data dictionaries.andM;Screen Design EditorandM;Neither the manual nor the disks contain any kind of tutorial.andP;  Instead, itis suggested that a new user loads one of the supplied example applicationsin the \WW directory, looks at it, modifies it and generates code from it.andM;Starting up UI reveals a blank screen except for cursor position and statusindicators at the top right.andP;  This is, in fact, the design editor.andP;  All thetools and facilities are accessed either from a menu or, with morefamiliarity, with various key combinations.andP;  Pressing any function key orAlt-Z will display the menu as a bar across the top of the screen.andP;  The tenmain options select further drop-down menus.andM;F1 accesses help, F2 loads and saves files, F9 generates code and F10 allowsvarious configuration parameters to be set.andP;  The remaining keys are for thebox, menu, data and similar options -- see Figure 1.andP;  If, from the F6 'Box'menu, a 'New Box' is selected then further menus appear for border style,interior colour and box border.andP;  A box can then be stretched downwards and tothe right from the current cursor position.andP;  One quickly learns that thcursor must be correctly positioned before selecting a tool as there is noway of repositioning afterwards.andP;  For boxes and some other objects this isnot really a problem as tools to move, copy or re-size enable any requiredadjustment, but it is one of the many disconcerting features that are onlydiscovered by trial and the all-too-often error.andM;Designing in PracticeandM;For the main editing screen, the manual and the help panels are for referenceonly with no 'getting started' guide.andP;  Perhaps it should be self-evident thatan entry screen cannot be designed before creating a data file, but this andother less obvious prior requirements should be explained.andP;  For example, amenu box is not a box containing a list of options.andP;  It is, in fact, oneoption for which colours and other parameters must be individually specified.andO;The action it will initiate should also have been decided prior to menudesign.andP;  A completed option list can then be boxed if required.andP;  To discoverhow one menu can call another it is necessary to load and compile one of theexample applications; it is not mentioned at all in the manual.andM;With practice, it is clear that most visual aspects of a program can bedesigned on screen.andP;  This could prove very useful when discussing a newsystem with a user or client, as an acceptable user interface could bedesigned and agreed as part of the specification prior to any conventionalcoding.andP;  such layouts can include nested menus and multi-screen entry forms.andO;Source code can then be generated in all the main dBASE flavours and, to anextent, in C.andP;  Initially, one of the supplied templates can be selected,later you can modify them or add your own.andP;  The code produced can go farbeyond that needed for the screen itself.andP;  For an entry form, there aretemplates specifically for just Append or Edit, and also more comprehensiveones such as 'Basic'.andP;  This writes a self-contained sub-system with routinesto establish memory variables matching all the field variables and a bottomline menu with options like Next, Previous, Last, Goto, Edit, Append andDelete.andP;  It may not suit all requirements, but is a quick way to produce asimple system or the basis of a more complex one.andM;Code GenerationandM;The code itself varies according to the target software selected.andP;  It iscommented, and broken into procedures where appropriate.andP;  It may well provefar lengthier and slower than your own.andP;  Each menu or screen is fully codedas if it was a one-off, with much consequential duplication.andP;  A routine suchas REPLACE andless;fieldandgt; WITH andless;memvarandgt; puts each REPLACE on a separate line ratherthan place them in one command statement.andP;  The andless;memvarandgt; equivalents to fieldscomprise the field name with an 'm' prefix so that the last digit of a 10character field name ceases to be significant.andM;'STOCKWEEK1' , 'STOCKWEEK2' .andP;  .  .  'STOCKWEEK9' all effectively become'mSTOCKWEEK'.andP;  This sort of error is not reported and there is no warning inthe manual.andM;For dBASE users and other clones without the Clipper MENU TO and PROMPTcommands, the ability to produce bounce-bar and similar menus so easily willbe welcomed.andP;  A Data Dictionary feature is only partly explained, but can beused to add PICTURE and VALID to GET statements and to specify indexes andrelationships for the corresponding .DBF file.andM;The Template LanguageandM;To modify or write templates, a combination of normal dBASE code and the UItemplate language is used.andP;  The latter is identified by placing it withinandless;andless;UICODEandgt;andgt; and andless;andless;ENDUICODEandgt;andgt; statements or it can be embedded in dBASE codeby placing it inside andless;andless;andgt;andgt; symbols.andP;  During generation of source code, anynormal dBASE code is written straight to the output file, but template codeis interpreted using.andP;  TLB (Template Library) files.andP;  For example, andless;andless;display--box (bar)andgt; andgt; calls the Template Library function 'display-box' toexpand the menu, as drawn on the screen and named 'bar', into conventionaldBASE code.andP;  The language is wide in scope and is explained at length wittutorials and examples.andP;  Indeed 80% of the manual is devoted to templateexplanation and reference.andM;The VerdictandM;UI is a powerful product that will appeal to many, but not all.andP;  As aproductivity tool it is not so easy and intuitive to learn as is implied, andit tends to produce a stream of flabby code.andP;  If you write each applicationfrom scratch it may well save time, but not if you largely draw from andmodify existing routines.andP;  Indeed, programmers who already have their ownlibrary of routines and methods may not find it easy to make use of UI beyondthe screen design level.andP;  Others will find it useful for quick development orfor users, with a little help, to design simpler systems for themselves.andP;  Adevelopment group may well find it worth programming their own templates togive a 'house styl' to each team member's routines.andM;Randamp;R Report WriterandM;The name describes the product well.andP;  It enables reports to be designedwithout the need for conventional programming code.andP;  The basic system comeson three disks with a substantial manual.andP;  to use it with Clipper or FoxBaseindex files, an additional module is required.andP;  This comprises a disk withtwo 1K files and a single instruction sheet which is not a lot for an extra50 pound sterling.andP;  An optional source code generator comes on a further diskwith a 70 page booklet.andM;Installation is straightforward with clear instructions.andP;  Once completed,typing 'RR' takes you straight into the main edit screen.andP;  At the top is athree line control panel, on the left a line type column -- see Figure 2.andO;The remaining space is the work area.andP;  It is used rather like a spreadsheetwithout any cells.andP;  Text such as headings can be typed straight into the workarea, while most other operations are accessed by pressing the '/' key andselecting from menus displayed in the top control panel.andP;  Anyone familiarwith Lotus 1-2-3 will feel at home straight away.andM;Getting StartedandM;Line types comprise Title, Header, Body, Footer and Summary, and are selectedthrough the 'Line -- Create' and the n 'Line -- Insert' menus.andP;  For a simplecolumnar report fields can be placed on a 'Body' line by positioning thecursor, pressing the F10 (Options) key and selecting a field from a pop-uplist for the previously specified .DBF file.andP;  If it does not look right, '/Move' will re-position as required.andP;  Further body lines can be used ifneeded, eg for addresses.andP;  Next, add some header lines and type in a titleand some column headings.andP;  Add some footer lines if required.andP;  Then '/ Print-- Go' will scroll your report up the screen so that you can see just how itwill look.andP;  It is as easy as that.andM;Complex ReportsandM;It is with more complex reports that the full power of Randamp;R is revealed.andP;  Thescope for setting relationships is particularly good.andP;  A Master .DBF file isdefined.andP;  Other data files may be linked to it, and they in turn can belinked to one another.andP;  The relationships can be on a common or calculatedfield, they can also be one of three types.andP;  Exact is self-evident,Approximate can be used with a quantity range to find, say, a discount level;Scan will search for all matching records in the linked file.andP;  For all types,three Failure actions are available.andP;  Blank (omits data from the linkedfile), Skip (moves to next record in Master file) and Terminate (prompts userfor action).andP;  A nice touch is that, as criteria and rules are selected, aparagraph describing them in normal English is shown at the foot of thescreen.andP;  Internally Randamp;R builds a composite record from the linked files whichis displayed in the pick-list used for placing fields in the report.andM;Also included in the pick-list are calculated fields.andP;  These can be typed in(after selecting '/Fields -- Calculate -- Create'), but it is easier to usethe F10 (Options) facility.andP;  Through these fields, operators, functions andexpressions (such as a previously defined calculated field) can be picked tobuild the required new expression.andP;  About 75 built-in functions areavailable.andP;  Some are familiar ones such as VAL () and TRIM (), others areunique to Randamp;R and include ADDDAYS (), DAYSBTWN (), INLIST, INRANGE, CASE ().andO;Clearly the scope is very wide.andP;  Calculated Total fields can also be definedfrom options such as Sum, Count, Average, Variance.andP;  There can be a grandtotal for a whole report, reset for each page or reset for up to eightdifferent group levels.andM;Queries and GroupsandM;The query meny enables a subset of the data to be defined.andP;  First a field isselected from a pick-list and the n a 'comparison type' list is displayed.andO;Besides the expected 'equal to' and similar, there are in/not-in 'Range' and'List' options.andP;  The latter will accept a list of alternative criteria.andP;  Forexample, to obtain a random 10% sample, a survey could specify selection bybirth dates of 5th, 15th or 25th of any month.andP;  Not an easy task for manyad-hoc query tools, but no problem for Randamp;R.andP;  A Date-of-Birth field comparisonwith a list of 05/*/*, 15/*/* and 25/*/* (note the * wild card) extracts therequired records.andM;Although Randamp;R will expect normal .NDX or .NTX index files to exist whenrelationships are defined, it provides its own sort facilities for reportswith temporary index files.andP;  Selection through the normal menu and pick-listfacilities allow a sort hierarchy of up to eight fields.andP;  Grouping criteriadefaults to the sort fields but can be changed, eg Sort by date and Group bymonth.andP;  Separate headers and/or footers can be defined for each of up toeight levels of groups, and can include data in the form of previouslydefined 'Calculated TotalH fields.andP;  Page totals and a final Summary can alsobe included.andM;DocumentationandM;The 400 page manual is straightforward, clear and comprehensive.andP;  It appearsto cover every aspect, has examples where needed and a proper index.andP;  Itincludes a tutorial chapter for use with supplied report and data files.andO;Learning from printed instructions may seem rather old fashioned but do notbe put off, it is very good.andP;  As one follows the clear instructions forcreating the example reports, there are reminders to look at the Help screensfor further guidance.andP;  These too are good, are not over verbose, but includea reference to the manual pages containing fuller details.andP;  Even whendesigning the relatively complicated multi-line invoice report, the screenlayout and cursor position always exactly matched the illustrations in thetutorial.andM;OptionsandM;During Setup, although screen, index types and other details can bespecified, most questions relate to printers.andP;  Standard configurations for upto eight different printers may be selected from a supplied list of around60.andP;  This sounds a lot but many commonly used printers are missing, eg the HPDeskjet and the current Star range.andP;  It is possible to supplement theseconfigurations or write your own -- this seemed necessary in all cases forenlarged and NLQ styles.andP;  Pitch is limited to 10, 12 or compressed andapplies to the whole document.andP;  Lines may be only six or eight to the inchand cannot be specified in n/72 or n/216 units.andP;  This will be a problem whena report must fit a pre-printed form.andM;During design of a report, more print options are accessed through menus.andP;  Itis possible to set currency to the 'pound sterling' symbol and date format tothe British style.andP;  There is also provision in the 'Field' and 'Line' menustructures for attributes and fonts to be applied to specified fields/textand lines.andP;  In all respects except one, the range of options gives greatflexibility and will satisfy most requirements.andP;  However, if you need to chopand change the number of characters or lines per inch within a report, youare probably back to conventional coding.andM;PerformanceandM;Randamp;R proved a robust package and tolerant of initial user errors.andP;  It isrelatively slow at processing its own internal sort and query operations, andthis might prove a problem with large files.andP;  Its otherwise impeccabletutorial revealed an internal logic error.andP;  In the header of an invoice theADDDAY () function correctly added the specified 30 days to the order date.andO;When used again at the foot, it showed a different date, apparently that ofthe next record as, by then, the file pointer had moved on.andP;  The limitationson formatting with font changes are a disappointment.andP;  I find that gettingthis right is often the most time consuming part of print routines and itshould be possible to provide a tool to help with this.andM;Three Ways of Using Randamp;RandM;Randamp;R can be used entirely as a stand-alone product.andP;  It needs data in the formof .DBF, DBT and index files, but does not require dBASE or other software.andO;This is the mode in which reports are designed; it can also be used for allprinting.andP;  Indeed there could be circumstances where, for a user who requiresonly output from data on supplied files, Randamp;R might be a better solution thana database package.andP;  Again, an application written in Clipper might handleall data entry and regular reports but not cope so well with ad-hoc needs.andO;Provision of Randamp;R could be a much better solution for a moderately competentuser than trying to include a complex query module within the application.andM;The standard Randamp;R package includes runtime files that may be distributed tousers with pre-designed report files.andP;  It is possible to print or displaystraight from DOS but most will wish to do so from within a databaseapplication.andP;  This is done through use of the 'RUN' command, with parameters,and requires at least 25K of free RAM.andP;  A range of options provide usercontrol and error trapping for flexibility.andP;  No problems were encounteredusing this simple and economical method.andM;For dBASE IV (not III+), Clipper, FoxBase, Quicksilver and dBXL, a separatecode generator is available.andP;  As with Randamp;R itself, it is easy to install anduse and, as a means of obtaining code for inclusion in a compiledapplication, it does look attractive.andP;  However, its use as an alternative tothe run-time method is debateable.andP;  The code it produces is lengthy and,where several reports are involved, repetitive.andP;  There is a facility to omitand generate separately any common functions, but this only a partialsolution.andP;  To avoid excessive growth in the size of the compiled .EXE file, afair amount of manual editing would be required, never too easy withunfamiliar code.andP;  Even then, for more than one or two reports, it may prove aless efficient use of RAM than the run-time alternative.andP;  There is also lesserror trapping -- one test failed through a numeric overflow that, inrun-time only, gave a nonsense figure.andM;ConclusionsandM;Randamp;R is undoubtedly one of the more useful dBASE add-ons and its suitabilityas a user tool as well was an unexpected bonus.andP;  As with many such packages,if you have already perfected your own library of print routines you may notconsider it worth changing.andP;  However, if you find that producing all thosereports the typical user demands is a time-consuming chore, then Randamp;R isprobably the best solution around.andM;Both UI and Randamp;R are powerful tools.andP;  The main 'pro' is that, for manyprogrammers, they should both ease and speed development of a new system.andO;The 'cons' are less easily defined.andP;  The code they produce may not fitcomfortably within existing and familiar programming methods.andP;  There will beunusual or complex situations where they will not cope, so leaving theprogrammer to tackle the difficult before he has cut his teeth on thecommonplace.andP;  A decision on purchase will, therefore, depend more on how youview the pros and cons than the products themselves as most will find thesesatisfactory.andM;Bob Rimmington is an independent consultant.andP;
