Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, said recently that key oil ministers woulddiscuss the proposal at a meeting scheduled for late next month inVienna.   Venezuela's newly inaugurated president, Carlos Andres Perez, hasreportedly urged in recent trips to the Middle East that a summit beheld.   In his inaugural speech last week, Perez said he had found``receptivity to the idea of celebrating, at a convenient date, ameeting of sovereigns and chiefs of state.''   He said a ``meeting of OPEC chiefs of state is consideredpropitious to give approval to a strategy that will orient theorganization during the 90s.''   An OPEC summit was last held in March 1975 in Algiers.   The oil ministers of Ecuador, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Venezuelamet last week in Venezuela. Afterward, Subroto said, ``Everybodypresent at the meeting expressed the need for the holding of an OPECsummit.''   Subroto, according to the OPEC News Agency, said the proposalwould be discussed by the eight oil ministers attending next month'smeeting in Vienna. The news agency said the ministers, members of amonitoring committee, would discuss the time, place and theme of theproposed gathering.   Analysts cautioned that scheduling a high-level meeting wouldraise hopes that the leaders would act to strengthen the oil market.Failure to do so, they said, would deliver a sharp blow to thefinancial markets.   ``There's not a great deal they can do,'' said London-basedanalyst Paul McDonald. ``I think it (a summit) would be about themost disastrous thing they could do. I cannot imagine what on earththey could find to talk about.''   Oil prices have tended to climb in advance of recent OPECmeetings and often tumbled afterward when expectations of strongsteps were dashed.   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,said he doubted a meeting of the heads of state would be scheduledthis year. But he said there was a ``reasonable chance'' of one in1990 to mark OPEC's startup.   Bahman Karbassioun, a consultant in Vienna, agreed. ``There maybe a summit, maybe next year,'' he said.   He said OPEC had planned a 20th anniversary summit in September1980. But the meeting was canceled when war broke out between bitterenemies Iran and Iraq.   By holding a 30th anniversary gathering, MacLeod said, the headsof state would have ``a reason to meet'' and hold down expectationsin the markets.   The cartel was formed in September 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. It currently has 13 members.   The officials would likely review the goals of the organizationand plot their strategy in the coming decade, analysts said.   A 1990 summit would give the cartel time to assess the fresh pushto restore discipline among its members and the impact of the Augustcease-fire between Iran and Iraq.   At a November meeting in Vienna, the oil ministers fashioned anew production accord in an effort to curtail their output and liftprices. They set an overall production ceiling of 18.5 millionbarrels a day for the first six months of 1989, sharply under thelevels at the end of last year.   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that OPEC crude production in January was 19.4 millionbarrels a day, off 3.4 million barrels a day from December.   Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, slashed productionlast month by more than 2 million barrels a day to an average of 4.5million barrels a day, according to the newly released report.   Crude prices have generally been rising since the outputagreement was struck, a pickup tied to optimism that the OPECcountries intend to stick to the individual output targets set inthe accord. Prices, though, are still under the cartel's benchmarkof $18 a barrel.   As part of the accord, the oil ministers set up the monitoringcommittee to watch prices in the market and members' adherence totheir new quotas. Panel members represent Algeria, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   Other OPEC members are Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, the United ArabEmirates and Qatar.</TEXT></DOC>
