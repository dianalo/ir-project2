What is new is that now an end user can construct a much widerrange of applications.andP;  Yes, you too can be a Real Programmer, even if youcan't remember the difference between **(handle.field) and (**handle.field).andM;A case in point is Serius89, which lets you write your own program by pickingpredefined data types and controls (scroll bars, OK buttons and so on) anddata-conversion functions, linking them into a sequence of actions, andtesting their operation to be sure they do what you want.andP;  When you aresatisfied, you compile the program into a regular Macintosh application thatyou can run by double-clicking on its icon.andM;Serius89 comes in two versions: the Programmer package for $295, which onlylets you manipulate predefined objects (Serius will add new objects in updatereleases), and the Developer package for $495, which lets you define your ownobjects using any of the traditional programming languages like C or Fortran.andO;Serius also says that it wiU soon release a Windows version.andM;Serius Corporation, P.O.andP;  Box 26708, Salt Lake City, UT 84126; phone (801)977-9077 or toll-free (800) 876-6847.andM;Another example is Maxem's Cause and Effects.andP;  Cause is the programming toolwith which you create application programs by pushing icons around on thescreen.andP;  Cause automatically generates the documentation to go with yourprogram.andP;  We haven't tried Cause yet, so we don't know how useful thedocumentation wiU be, but it sounds like a neat idea.andP;  You can buy either theregular version, for $495, which licenses you to build applications forin-house use only, or the Professional version, for $795, which includes alicense to embed the Cause runtime kernel in your application for resale tothe public.andM;Effects are vertical-market applications that have been built with Cause.andO;Maxem markets selected programs that its users have written in an Authorshipprogram, paying royalties to authors like any publisher.andP;  The Effects wiU bepriced in the $30-$99 range; Maxem says that it now has a half-dozen Effectson the market, with a like number soon to be added.andP;  While we're not sure howsuccessful Maxem will be in reaching many separate niche markets, we knowthat there is a vast reservoir of applicationspecific expertise among theend-user programmers.andP;  If it can tap that reservoir, Maxem could become avery successful software publisher.andM;Maxem, 7855 South River Parkway, Tempe AZ 85284; phone (6 02) 491 -2466 or(800) 336-6296; fax (602) 491 -2453.andM;Programmers who have already learned C or Pascal can migrate toobject-oriented versions of these traditional languages.andP;  Symantec'sLightspeed C 4.0 supports objects using a syntax similar to C + + .andP;  Version4 is an extension of ANSIstandard C, so existing C programs can be usedpretty much as is, allowing you to ease into the new mode of thinking thatobject programming requires.andP;  Pascal programmers will probably gravitatetoward Apple's own MacApp, available through APDA and other sources.andM;Symantec Corp., Think Technologies Division, 135 Soutb Road, Bedford, MA01730; pbone (617) 2754800.andM;UtilitiesandM;We were intrigued by the claims advanced for Inspiration in the CeresSoftware booth.andP;  It is an outliner and text editor, but what sets it apart isthe way it helps you brainstorm.andP;  You set keywords into the boxes of aflow-chart diagram (there are actually several container shapes, including acute little cloud for representing nebulous ideas) and then push them aroundon the screen as you visualize different relationships.andP;  You show theserelationships with arrows linking the boxes.andP;  At any point, you can displaythe diagram as an indented outline, and you can expand the keywords intoparagraphs of text.andM;Although Inspiration has many of the features of outliners like Acta andMore, it might be best used for working up non-structured ideas at the stagebefore they arc frozen into paragraphs and presentations.andP;  The price: $249.andM;Ceres Software, P.O.andP;  Box 1629, Portland, OR 97207; phone (503) 245-9011.andM;For every user who wished he had remembered to back up his work yesterday,Magic Software has Backmatic.andP;  It's a simple Control Panel file thatintercepts the Shutdown command and runs a backup routine before shutting theMac down.andP;  You can configure it for the type of file you want to include orskip, and you can invoke a Backup Now command that saves your work while youare in the middle of a program.andP;  For $99.95, it may be better than taping areminder notice to your computer.andM;Magic Software, 1602 Cascio Drive, Bellevue, AE 68005; pbone (402) 2910670.andM;DataViz, known for its MacLink program that translates files between Mac andPC file formats (including controlling the serial-port file transfers), hasadded support for Next and Sun computers in thc newest release (version 4.1).andO;In addition to developing the control software to run in the Next and Sunmachines, it has written format translators for SunWrite and the Unix versionof WriteNow.andP;  The product, now caUed MacLinkPlus, has translators for over100 Mac and PC file formats; the newest members handle MacWrite II and theApple File Exchange format.andM;DataViz, Inc., 35 Corporate Drive, Trumbull, CT 06611; pbone (203) 2680030;fax 268-4345.andM;Desktop publishingandM;Icom Simulations, probably better known as a publisher of games, has entereddesktop publishing with a Macintosh kerning utility, MacKern.andP;  Although ithad sneak-previewed the program a year ago, Icom had some seriousdisagreements with the programmer and ultimately decided to completelyoverhaul the program, keeping only the original user interface.andP;  We expect tohave more to say about this and other keming utilities in an upcoming issue.andM;Icom Simulations, 648 S.andP;  Wheeling Rd., Wheeling, IL 60090; pbone (312) 5204440.andM;Springboard.andP;  Springboard Software has released an updated version of itslow-end page layout program, Springboard Publisher II.andP;  From what we saw, theprogram has better graphics facilities (grayscale control for images, flowingtext over graphics, import of EPS and PICT files), a built-in spellingchecker, and some fancy text effects like rotated type and text on a curvedpath.andP;  What it doesn't have is any better control over paragraph composition.andM;Ragtime returns.andP;  Ragtime is back.andP;  Originally developed in Germany byBruning and Everth GmbH and sold in the U.S.andP;  by Orange Micro, the productwas withdrawn after failing to find a viable market for its specializedfeatures.andP;  (It was also rather buggy.) The developer, now Unicorn GmbH, hasenhanced the program and is attempting to re-establish it in the U.S.andO;market.andP;  Company representatives demonstrated a beta version of Ragtime 3 atMacworld and announced their plan to begin shipping it later this month toOEMs and resellers, with a list price of $595.andM;In the U.S., Ragtime is being handied by Migrant Software, of Narberth, PA,which picked up die rights when Cricket Software, which had triedunsuccessfully to market the product, was acquired by Computer SupportAssociates.andP;  Three-month-old Migrant is headed by Darragh Muldoon, one of thefounders of Cricket.andM;Like the original version (see Vol.andP;  1, No.andP;  II), Ragtime 3 is more a WYSIWYGcompound-document processor than a page make-up program, and therein lie itsstrengths and weaknesses in the U.S.andM;In addition to text formatting features, Ragtime provides a full wordprocessor/tcxt editor, spelling checker, and hyphenation in 14 languages.andP;  Italso offers built-in spreadsheets (portions of which can be placed into textframes), integral business graphics (including extraction of data fromspreadsheets) and import of line an and images.andP;  It supports a variety ofscanners-Agfa, Siemens, Apple-by providing gray-level and color curveadjustment fimctions.andM;The spreadsheet is what sets Ragtime apart.andP;  Sheets can be as large as 16,000rows and 253 columns.andP;  Individual cells can be rotated 90 deg.andP;  Over 70 math,financial, statistical, calendaring, indexing and mail-merge functions areavailable.andP;  Text processing features are fully integrated with spreadsheetoperation, and data can be imported from the popular Mac word processingprograms and from Mac and PC spreadsheets.andM;Ragtime's breadth of functionality has made it a popular program in WestGermany and other countries on the Continent.andP;  Unicorn positions the programas an &quot;office solution&quot; for business publishing-a posture many companies havetried to promote in the U.S.andP;  without resounding success.andP;  (Xerox's officepublishing products are a case in point.) Unicom further wishes to avoid thedesktop publishing label, feeling that it is too restrictive and too orientedto the graphic arts.andM;Ragtime is trying to defy categorization and &quot;nichemanship.&quot; This,unfortunately, is one of the keys to success in the U.S., where the roar ofthe competitive crowd requires that a produces application, utility andensuing benefits be well defined and spelled out for ready spoon feeding anddirection.andM;Unicorn GmbH, Ifflandstr.andP;  81-83, 2000 Hamburg 76, West Germany.andM;Migrant Software, 313 Iona St., Narberth, PA 19072; phone (215) 667-9781.andM;Multi-Ad Creator 2.0.andP;  Multi-Ad Services previewed version 2.0 of itssingle-page layout and display-ad makeup program.andP;  New features include:andM;* Style sheets and style models;andM;* Copyfitting, scaling type to fit a preandM;determined portion of a layout;andM;* Ability to add color to imported graandM;phic objects;andM;* Color separation capabilities such asandM;undercolor removal, gray-component replacement, mixing spot and process colorin one layout, and four- color separation of 32-bit color images;andM;* Spelling checking, dictionary-basedandM;hyphenation and a thesaurus;andM;* Adding prepress information to layandM;outs.andM;Version 2.0 will be available in October, priced at $995.andP;  Upgrades forcurrent users wiU be free.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
