<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0223 </DOCNO><TEXT>A partial clone library of barley DNA fragments based on plasmid pBR325was created. The cloned EcoRI-fragments of chromosomal DNA are from 2to 14 kbp in length. More than 95% of the barley DNA inserts compriserepeated sequences of different complexity and copy number. Certain ofthese DNA sequences are from families comprising at least 1% of the barleygenome. A significant proportion of the clones hybridize with numeroussets of restriction fragments of genome DNA and they are dispersed throughoutthe barley chromosomes.</TEXT></DOC>
