(designing a CD-ROM system for archiving data)(tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Price, Mike.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>CD-ROMs provide storage capacities of up to 650Mbytes per disk,but how they are used for archival storage depends on the types ofdata involved and how the data needs to be manipulated.andP;  CD-ROMscan be used as if they were a large hard disk.andP;  This would be auseful method if many files must be accessed with the files storedas standard directories on the CD-ROM disk.andP;  This is perhaps thesimplest method requiring no additional software other than adevice driver.andP;  CD-ROMs can also be used as on-line books, inplace of manuals and other documentation.andP;  On-line books can beefficiently searched for information by word or phrase.andP;  The IBMBookManager line of products can be useful in creating on-linedocumentation.andP;  Another method of retrieving information is usingBlueFish software from Lotus, which adds the use of standardBoolean operators to search methods.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CD-ROMStorage MediaTutorialMethodsStrategic PlanningSystem Design.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Designs on CD-ROM If you've looked at your options for distributing data (seeMastering CD-ROM, issue 155) and you've decided to try this emergingtechnology, how do you set about designing a suitable system?andM;Your data is the most important factor in deciding the design -- the sizesand types of data involved, the sort of functions that have to be performed,and the data preparation and manipulation that will be required.andM;If you simply want to make lots of PC files available, you could treat theCD-ROM as a rather large disk and store the files in standard directories.andO;This would need no special software (other than the CD-ROM device drivers),and you'd be able to store up to 650Mb on a single CD-ROM disk.andM;It could be difficult to locate particular files on a full disk and asupplementary indexing system might be required.andP;  This approach has been usedfor the RBBS bulletin board on a CD-ROM, which contains shareware and publicdomain programs in PKZIP archived form.andP;  The disk contains over 15,000 setsof files in compressed .ZIP form, for a total of 650Mb.andP;  These represent morethan 100,000 individual files which, if fully expanded from their archivedform would occupy over 1.4Gb memory.andM;To make it easy to find the required archive, the files are organisedalphabetically.andP;  They're distributed into 60 subdirectories (named with thefirst four characters of the last file in that directory), each withapproximately 250 archived file sets.andM;A master index contains all the archive names and their descriptions.andP;  TheVIEWDIR command allows you to browse the catalogue.andP;  There's a FIND commandthat locates all the descriptions with a specified word or phrase, creating asubcatalogue.andM;The VIEW command uses PKZIP programs to examine the contents of an archiveand allows you to look at text files in the package.andP;  When you've identifiedthe name of the package you want, the CDCOPY program locates and copies thearchive file to the specified disk.andP;  The archived file set can then beexpanded using the PKUNZIP program.andM;If you're dealing with files directly, the basic PC file access facilitiescan be used, or supplemented by programs to assist you in managing largedirectories, and the CD-ROM can be treated as a mass storage device.andM;Alternatively, you may be planning to use CD-ROM in place of printed books ormanuals.andP;  On-line books have many of the advantages of printed books, butoffer you more flexibility.andP;  You're not limited to using the index or tableof contents, or flipping through the pages to find information.andP;  You cansearch for information directly -- simply by asking for what you want tofind.andP;  You can search for a word or phrase, move from topic to topic withoutreferring to the table of contents, move directly to a cross-referencedtopic, figure, or table, and even change the colours or the size of typeface.andM;IBM BookManager is a family of products that lets you create and use on-linebooks and documents at your workstation.andP;  The on-line books are created withthe BookManager Build program, which processes source files using IBM'sDocument Composition Facility (DCF).andP;  These source files may include flatfiles or files containing formatting markup language controls.andM;In the OS/2 1.2 system, there's a similar facility used for on-line help andreference.andP;  This is the Information Presentation Facility (IPF), which uses amarkup language similar to the BookManager system.andM;The View program supplied as a part of OS/2 allows you to navigate throughthese on-line documents, search for specific words and follow hypertext linksbetween sections.andM;The program also includes a hypergraphics facility to produce graphic links.andO;You can provide your own on-line documents using the IPF Compiler providedwith the OS/2 developer's toolkit.andP;  The programs can be used for files storedon disk or CD-ROM, depending on the size of the files, which typically rangefrom 0.5Mb to 5Mb.andM;Lotus BlueFish Searchware provides an alternative means to retrieve on-lineinformation.andP;  This is more suited to larger numbers of small files that arerelated together.andP;  The combined library files are typically large and couldbe well in excess of 100Mb.andP;  The searchware allows you to search for, andretrieve, information from these prepared libraries.andP;  You look up occurrencesof words or combinations of words in the database by entering a query.andP;  Youcan then view a list of titles or browse all the documents that match yourquery.andM;BlueFish supports standard Boolean operators (AND, OR, WITHOUT, WITHIN), andyou can reference previous queries to expand or narrow your search.andP;  Whenmatching documents are found, you can either browse the titles or read each(or any) article or abstract.andP;  Search words are highlighted in the matcheddocuments.andP;  Alternatively, you can copy data to a file or print out all orpart of your search results.andM;This software is specifically for CD-ROM and can't be used directly on fixeddisk, although it does make use of the fixed disk for creating temporaryfiles containing the results of searches.andM;A product that uses Lotus searchware is the Computer Library periodicalsdatabase.andP;  This contains articles and abstracts from a large number ofcomputer journals, magazines and reports, including PC User.andP;  The library ispublished monthly and contains 12 months-worth of articles.andP;  Each editionholds 55,000 articles and abstracts from more than 140 publications, with atotal of nearly 400Mb of information.andM;All the examples so far have involved mainly standard text information orsimple graphics images.andP;  However, the CD-ROM format can also accommodateaudio or video motion data.andP;  Applications in these cases can generate verylarge volumes of data.andM;The Mediabase product from Cybernetics provides support for such multimediaapplications.andP;  It's a Windows-based product and offers authoring facilities(to assist you in preparing your data and developing your applications), aswell as search and access facilities.andP;  With these more complex applications,you may decide to call in a specialist agency to help you design and developyour applications.andM;Once you've assessed your data and function requirements and selected yoursearch software, you'll need to prepare your data ready for formatting.andP;  Ifyou have standard files, as in the initial example, you may need to do nomore than copy the files in a suitable directory structure to a largecapacity WORM drive, or to tape.andM;There are some constraints that have to be observed.andP;  The number of levels inthe directory hierarchy can't exceed eight.andP;  The entire path length can havea maximum of 255 characters.andP;  The length of the file name can be up to 31characters.andP;  However, they should also obey the rules of the target systemfor which the CD-ROM disk is intended.andM;For MS-DOS files, the standard maxima of 8-byte name and 3-byte extensionswill still apply.andP;  In addition, you should note that file names mustn'tcontain any characters other than upper case alphabetics and underscore.andP;  Anyspecial characters, lower case or blanks in the filenames are illegal.andM;For on-line books, you'll need to edit and organise the information into therequired structure, inserting the required tags for markup and linkages.andM;If this effort is required on a regular basis, for periodic re-issues, or ifyou have lots of documents of a particular type, it may be necessary for youto build programs to carry out the majority of the markup automatically.andM;Preparation of data for other applications, especially those which involvesignificant amounts of audio or video data, could require specialistassistance.andP;  Again, you should end up with a WORM disk or a tape that can besent to the CD-ROM production company.andM;There are other search engines available, each offering particular strengthsand areas of emphasis.andP;  Your choice should be matched to the requirements ofyour particular data.andP;  You should also take into account the environment inwhich the data will be used.andP;  For example, it may be easier to share dataacross a LAN if the system can be run from fixed disk as well as CD-ROM.andO;This will allow active files to be copied to fixed disk, improvingperformance as well as accessibility.andM;The actual formatting of the data, the creation of the volume descriptors,file descriptors, directory descriptors, path tables and file sections thatmake up the CD-ROM disk, is usually carried out by the CD-ROM productioncompany (see issue 155).andM;This process, plus the final mastering and replication, usually takes 7 to 10days.andP;  However, any errors found in the data sent for formatting willobviously extend this time frame.andM;For the greatest integrety, it may be necessary to produce a trial master,before the replication actually begins and this must be allowed for in theschedules.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
