The laboratory accreditation involvesboth the EPA and the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program(NVLAP), National Bureau of Standards. The NVLAP accreditation requiresthe laboratory to complete a technical application which describes thetesting facility, personnel, and training procedures. An inspection ofthe laboratory by technical personnel is also required. The EPA accreditationrequires the laboratory to complete a number of administrative itemsand to complete a demonstration of proficiency using the emission testingprocedures defined in the regulation. EPA will review the capabilitiesof the laboratory personnel to follow the test methods and to preparean accurate and complete report of the procedures and results. Laboratoryaccreditation is a new function for EPA and has resulted in a numberof new tasks. These tasks include administering applications, schedulinginspection visits, establishing proficiency demonstration requirements,and reviewing test reports and results for laboratory evaluation purposes.These tasks are designed to provide standardization and consistency betweentesting laboratories in conducting wood heater certification tests.</TEXT></DOC>
