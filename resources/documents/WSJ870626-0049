Garcia</HL><DD> 06/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices moved higher yesterday, taking their cue from a firmer dollar and an advance in the bond market.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 22.64 points to a record 2451.05, surpassing its previous high of 2445.51, set Monday. The industrial average quickly gained about 15 points in the first few minutes of trading as the stage was set by the dollar's climb earlier in the day in Tokyo and London trading. The average held its early gains until midafternoon, when it extended them.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index moved up 2.10 to 308.96, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.15 to 173.55.    Gains in airline stocks and a few railroad issues pushed up the Dow Jones Transportation Average 12.05 to a record 1039.25. Its previous high of 1029.53 was set June 12.    Big Board volume expanded to 173.5 million shares from 153.8 million Wednesday as gainers had nearly a 2-to-1 lead over decliners.    &quot;The path of least resistance (for stock prices) tends to be up right now,&quot; said Martin Krouner, head of capital commitment for Jefferies. He said that there seemed to be investor interest in individual stocks, but there weren't many entire groups posting heady gains.    Besides the advance in the dollar and in the bond market, Eugene Peroni, director of technical research with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, believes expectations of higher second-quarter earnings have been fueling recent gains in the stock market.    He thinks that some money managers have been spending some cash as the end of the quarter nears. But Mr. Peroni believes their buying has been concentrated in blue-chip, large-capitalization stocks, such as the 30 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, because investors might expect earnings to be stronger for these companies.    While analysts at Standard andamp; Poor's see a positive outlook for overall corporate profits in the second quarter and for the rest of the year, they said that once again actual results might fall short of analysts' expectations. Mr. Peroni agrees that stock investors might be in for a dismal summer &quot;if second-quarter results don't delight the market.&quot;    USAir rose 1 5/8 to 47 on volume of more than 4.7 million shares, making it the most active Big Board issue. Some of the volume was generated by a 10 million-share issue that the airline sold yesterday at $45 a share.    Allegis dropped 1/8 to 89 3/4 in moderate trading. After the market closed, the company said it will be selling all of its nonairline assets, and shareholders will get the proceeds. Allegis executives resigned in a major restructuring.    Among other airline stocks, AMR rose 5/8 to 62 3/8, Delta Air Lines gained 3/4 to 57 3/4 and NWA rose 1/4 to 73 1/8.    Oil stocks were mostly higher as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began its meeting in Vienna, Austria.    Dayton Hudson fell 1 to 50 in active trading. After the market closed, the Minnesota legislature passed an anti-takeover bill aimed at thwarting Dart Group's interest in acquiring the Minneapolis-based retailer. But it wasn't immediately clear if the bill would end takeover speculation about Dayton Hudson.    Golden Nugget increased 1/8 to 13 1/8 in heavy volume of more than 2.3 million shares. Traders said the activity was fueled by rumors of a leveraged buyout. But Clyde Turner, chief financial officer for Golden Nugget, said management wasn't involved in a leveraged buyout and he didn't know of any reason for the increased activity in the company's stock.    Technology stocks were mixed. International Business Machines rose 1 3/4 to 167 7/8, Digital Equipment eased 1/2 to 168 1/2, Cray Research moved up 1 7/8 to 100 5/8 and Advanced Micro Devices lost 1 to 18 5/8. Tandem Computers sank 4 1/8 to 32 on heavy volume; a Wall Street brokerage firm reduced its rating on the stock.    Reichhold Chemicals jumped 18 1/4 to 60 1/2, with more than 2.3 million shares changing hands. Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals, a Japanese concern that has been pursuing U.S. technology companies, offered to acquire Reichhold at $52.50 a share. Market participants seemed to be anticipating a higher bid for the company, as the stock traded way above Dainippon's offering price. Reichhold said it would study the offer and hired First Boston as a financial adviser.    Teledyne moved up 6 3/4 to 335. The electronics and avionics concern owns a 15% stake in Reichhold.    Diamond-Bathurst added 3 1/4 to 25. Anchor Glass Container agreed to acquire Diamond-Bathurst for $25.50 a share, or about $191 million.    Burlington Northern moved up 4 1/8 to 77 3/4 in active trading on reports that Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has acquired a stake in the company. Mr. Jacobs couldn't be reached.    Gruntal Financial rose 1 3/8 to 9 1/4. The regional brokerage firm agreed to merge with a unit of Home Group at $9.50 a share.    Manpower rose 3 7/8 to 53 5/8. The company said earnings in its first quarter, ended May 31, rose to 57 cents a share from 34 cents a year earlier.    Community Psychiatric advanced 2 1/8 to 41 1/2 in active trading. The stock was added to the Sandamp;P 500-stock index. Usually, when a stock is added to the index, there is a flurry of demand because investors who pattern their portfolios on the index must buy the stock.    Stride-Rite gained 2 1/8 to 40. The shoe maker said net income in its second quarter, ended May 29, rose to 94 cents a share from 64 cents a year earlier. In early May, Stride Rite said the Belzburg family of Canada had a stake in the company.    Dickey-John added 2 1/2 to 19 1/2 in OTC trading. An investor group with a 10% stake in the company may consider proposing a merger &quot;or similar transaction.&quot;    Chrysler rose 3/8 to 35 7/8 in heavy volume. In the first criminal odometer-tampering case ever brought against a major auto maker, a Chrysler unit and two executives were charged with conspiring to sell over 60,000 cars and trucks as new after the vehicles were allegedly used by company managers with the odometers disconnected. </TEXT></DOC>
