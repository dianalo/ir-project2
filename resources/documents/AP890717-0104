The report by the Office of Technology Assessment, which advisesCongress on scientific issues, said even if all known methods ofpollution control are used, many cities will remain above federallimits for smog-causing ozone by the end of the century.   It said residents of the most polluted cities _ Los Angeles, NewYork and Houston _ may have to live with unhealthy levels of smogfor another 20 years or more.   Bush said last month in proposing a sweeping revision of the 1970Clean Air Act that his measures would mean the vast majority of theapproximately 100 cities currently in violation of ozone limitscould gain compliance by 1995. The president said all cities wouldbe within the limits by the end of the century.   The Office of Technology Assessment study, which was begun twoyears ago, did not specifically analyze the Bush proposal, butRobert Friedman, the report's main author, told a news conferencethe administration's forecast was probably too rosy.   ``I don't see how they're going to do it,'' he said. ``I hope weare wrong and they are right, but I fear that will not be the case.''   He said in an earlier interview that between 30 and 45 citiesprobably will still be in violation of the ozone standard by theyear 2000, even if all available anti-pollution technologies areused. Among these are Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Washington,D.C., Boston, Baltimore and St. Louis, he said.   The report did not include a complete list of cities and theirprospects for compliance.   Ozone is formed when hydrocarbons from car exhaust and othersources mix in sunlight with nitrogen oxides released by the burningof fossil fuels such as petroleum.   Ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere, where it filters thesun's rays. But closer to the ground, ozone turns into choking smogthat some scientists believe could cause permanent lung damage bylimiting the lungs' ability to ward off infection.   The OTA study said that each year, about 21 million people areexposed during outdoor exercise to ozone levels above the federalstandard, each of them for about nine hours a year, on average.About one-quarter of these people live in Los Angeles.   ``Though experts disagree about the level of danger that ozoneactually poses to the population, a large portion of the Americanpeople live in places where ozone concentrations far exceed thoseknown to be completely safe,'' the study said.   The White House is expected to unveil later this week fulldetails of its clean air proposal, which was announced June 12 inoutline form. Draft legislation incorporating Bush's proposals hasbeen circulated on Capitol Hill in recent days.   Friedman said lack of detail in the original administration planmade it impossible to fully explain why Bush believed more gainsagainst urban smog are possible than foreseen in the OTA study.   The Environmental Protection Agency said in a written response tothe Office of Technology Assessment study that it did not take intoaccount the administration's assumption that state and localgovernments would take their own anti-pollution measures tosupplement the federal measures proposed by Bush.   The EPA said an administration bill would include ``strongenforcement and compliance provisions to see that non-federalactivities are implemented and succeed.''   Among the most effective means of curbing ozone are reducinggasoline's evaporation rate; modifying gas station pumps to trapescaping vapors, and tightening controls on facilities that treat,store and dispose of hazardous wastes such as chemicals and sludge.   The OTA said the cost of employing all available technologiesnationwide would be between $4.4 billion and $7.8 billion a year bythe mid-1990s and between $8.8 billion and $13 billion per year adecade later.</TEXT></DOC>
