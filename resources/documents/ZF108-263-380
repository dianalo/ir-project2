Becker Jr.andM;Backing up a hard disk is like brushing your teeth -- an unpleasant dailychore that can be skipped only at the risk of extreme pain.andP;  For hard diskowners, the perfect solution would be a fully transparent, automatic,background backup of the entire hard disk.andM;We have yet to attain that perfection, but several new utilities designed tosupplement regular backup programs will save copies of important filesautomatically.andP;  Shadow 1.23 from Natural Intelligence Inc. backs up filesfrom a user-defined list -- and, optionally, all open files -- at a specifiedinterval.andP;  Backmatic 1.01 from Magic Software Inc. runs at shutdown toprovide the equivalent of an incremental backup.andP;  And AutoBack 1.31 from SoftTrends keeps a constant copy of your data files on a second, mounted harddisk.andM;Shadow 1.23.andP;  Shadow is a desk accessory that will automatically save copiesof up to 90 selected files.andP;  Copies of files can be saved to anyFinder-mountable volume, including removable hard disks but excluding mosttape drives.andP;  You can save all the files in the same place or set differentlocations for each copy.andP;  If you like, Shadow will check regularly foradditional open files and ask if you want them added to the current backuplist.andP;  You also can set it to issue a Save command periodically to theprogram you are running.andM;Only one list can be active at any time, although you can save multiple liststo disk and invoke them at will.andP;  Shadow won't split a file across disks, soif you're using floppies you can't back up anything larger than 1.4 Mbytes.andM;Once installed, Shadow has to be configured.andP;  As shipped, Shadow willautomatically back up files and check for open files to be added to the listevery five minutes.andP;  It also will issue a Save command once a minute.andP;  Any ofthese options can be changed through a simple dialog.andM;In our tests, operation was seamless and for the most part transparent.andP;  Onshorter files, the automatic backups were barely noticeable (we timed Shadowat about half the speed of the Finder's Duplicate command).andP;  On large filesthe delay can be annoying; we wouldn't recommend it for saving monsters.andP;  Ifthe destination disk is missing at backup time, the program politely promptsyou to find it or pick a new destination.andM;Shadow has to be open to work.andP;  Unless you're running MultiFinder, which canautomatically open desk accessories at start-up, you'll either have toremember to invoke it each time you change applications or find some way toautomate the process, such as the old, but still functional, freeware Startupdocument (INIT) Immortality, available from on-line services and user groups.andO;And you'll have to keep Shadow open constantly, a minor annoyance thatstopped troubling us after a week of use.andM;There were a few small anomalies.andP;  The dialog asking if we wanted to add newopen files interfered with automated telecommunication sessions unless weresponded to it.andP;  And if you open, modify and close a file during Shadow'sinterval for checking open files, the file won't get backed up.andP;  If you'rerunning Desktop Manager, Shadow will regularly ask if you want to add its twoopen files, Desktop DB and Desktop DF, to your set.andP;  Even if you answer &quot;No,&quot;Shadow will remember your refusal only until your next start-up.andP;  In the longrun, we found it more convenient to permit the useless backup of those filesthan to suffer the question every session.andM;Shadow is a reliable and useful program.andP;  Even though we back up our harddisks daily, it's easy for a crash to destroy up to a day's work.andP;  WithShadow running, we never had to worry about losing more than a few minutes.andO;Its capability to save different files to different locations also makes it aconvenient way to move files between home and office machines.andP;  With minimaleffort, Shadow can provide valuable, low-cost insurance against hard diskcrashes.andM;Backmatic 1.01.andP;  By contrast, Backmatic is a combined Control Paneldevice/INIT primarily designed as a substitute for daily incremental backups.andO;As shipped, it will automatically search your hard disk at shutdown for fileschanged since the last time it ran and then save them to floppies.andP;  Backmaticalso can be invoked manually through the Control Panel.andP;  And if you prefer,you can set Backmatic to save files to a folder on a hard disk or fileserver.andM;Backmatic gives you extensive control over the files to be backed up, with awell-designed filtering scheme.andP;  You can exclude files based on their filetype (all INITs, for example, or all Word Temp files), their creator (allHyperCard files, for example), the folder in which they reside or the diskthey're on.andP;  You can list specific files that should always be backed up,whether or not they've been changed.andP;  Backmatic will back up to a series offloppies but won't split large files across disks.andM;The backup process takes a while since Backmatic first scans all hard disksnot excluded.andP;  This wasn't annoying at shutdown but discouraged us frommaking regular backups during the working day.andP;  The actual backup wasrelatively fast to a hard disk (more than half a megabyte a minute) andreasonably speedy to floppies.andM;In operation, Backmatic performed reliably; our only problems were smallones.andP;  The program doesn't maintain your folder structure, a minor hassle ifthere are lots of files.andP;  On the other hand, since each backup goes in a newfolder, it can provide a convenient archive of earlier versions.andP;  Itsometimes refused to make an immediate backup because of a RAM shortage.andP;  AndBackmatic occasionally reported that a file was in an excluded folder when itwasn't, but the file backed up fine.andM;We looked at a late developmental copy of Version 1.1, which will be sentfree to all registered users.andP;  It speeds up the backup process substantiallyand splits large files across disks.andP;  It also allows timed backups and addsfeatures for networks.andM;The current version of Backmatic is most valuable for people who want toautomate daily incremental backups.andP;  It's too slow and cumbersome to userepeatedly during the day.andP;  Version 1.1 will speed the process and can be setto back up regularly, but since it backs up everything at once, each backupwill cause a noticeable interruption of your work.andP;  Backmatic works well fora few backups a day, but if you must be up to the minute, we'd recommend oneof the other options.andM;AutoBack 1.31.andP;  AutoBack is an INIT designed for those who want analways-current copy of their data files on a second hard disk.andP;  It won't backup to most tape drives or to floppies, so you need lots of extra hard diskspace to run it.andP;  But if the space is available, it will back up every fileas it is changed, automatically and for the most part unobtrusively.andM;As shipped, AutoBack is set to back up everything on your hard disk or disks,except for applications and most of the files likely to find their way intoyour System folder (INITs, cdevs and so forth).andP;  Thus, if you don't changethe settings, it will make a complete copy of your data files the first timeyou use it.andP;  AutoBack includes built-in utilities to restore files and todelete old files from your backup set; these are convenient though notindispensable, since the same tasks could be done manually with little extratrouble.andM;If you want to copy only a subset of files, AutoBack's filtering options arelimited.andP;  You can choose to include only files created by particularapplications or to exclude files on a folder-by-folder basis.andP;  However, youcan't include, for example, only three of five Microsoft Word documents inone folder; exclude individual files, except by putting them in an excludedfolder; or easily exclude an entire hard disk.andM;Once configured, AutoBack generally ran smoothly.andP;  In more than a month oftesting it never failed to copy a file that was being saved.andP;  However, fileshave to be saved by an application or DA to be backed up; AutoBack doesn'tcopy files duplicated in the Finder.andM;On small files we didn't notice the additional time required to make a copy.andO;For larger files, a dialog box appears, giving you the option to cancel thecopy if you're in a hurry.andP;  You can set the file size that triggers thisalert.andP;  As files approached 500 Kbytes, the slowdown was occasionallyannoying.andP;  We wouldn't recommend using AutoBack with large databases orHyperCard stacks, which get modified with every use.andM;Configuration is no problem if you're happy to back up everything, but if youaren't, the inclusion and exclusion process is poorly designed and slow.andO;Folders are excluded through a cumbersome dialog that places a 0-Kbyte filecalled No Backups in the folder to be excluded.andP;  Although these files serveas useful visual reminders, they add to desktop clutter.andP;  AutoBack can take15 minutes or more to configure, much longer than the other two utilitiesreviewed.andM;Configuration, however annoying, is usually a one-time thing.andP;  Other problemswere more irritating.andP;  HyperCard files are saved with the file name convertedto lower case, and when &quot;unstuffing&quot; files compressed with Aladdin SystemsInc.'s StuffIt to a No Backups folder, the process slows to a crawl.andP;  If thehard disk to which you're saving files mounts late in the start-up process,AutoBack may tell you the disk is unavailable, even though it mounts secondslater.andP;  And AutoBack sometimes triggered the protection mechanisms ofSymantec AntiVirus for Macintosh's advanced mode.andM;We also experienced occasional glitches.andP;  AutoBack sometimes refused to makean initial backup, although subsequently changed files were backed up fine.andO;Rebooting and repeating the backup fixed the problem.andP;  Once, it lost track ofa backup folder and presented us with a confusing error message.andP;  Resettingthe location from the Control Panel cleared up this one.andP;  Occasionally thecdev insisted that AutoBack wasn't installed even when it was, and thuswouldn't let us change parameters.andP;  And AutoBack's dialogs overwrote ourcolor desktop with a black rectangle.andM;We wouldn't recommend AutoBack in its present form to naive users.andP;  But ifyou're experienced, want an up-to-the-minute copy of a hard disk and have thedisk space available, AutoBack is probably the program of choice.andM;Conclusions.andP;  These programs aren't for everyone.andP;  None will substitute forregularly running a good backup program.andP;  But each of them can be a goodsupplement.andM;If you can't remember to do a daily backup, or want to archive your changedfiles, Backmatic is a good choice.andP;  If you want a hundred or more filesbacked up whenever they're modified, consider AutoBack.andP;  If you simply wantto keep copies of the files you're working on, or back up any reasonablyshort list of files, Shadow is probably the program for you.andP;  Finally, if youwant to move your work files back and forth between two machines, eitherBackmatic or Shadow will do that well.andM;Natural Intelligence Inc. is located at 86 Richdale Ave., Cambridge, Mass.andO;02140;
