The Miami-based environmental services and hazardous-waste disposal concern also said net income for the second quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 62% to $374,017, or 12 cents a share, from $230,324, or eight cents a share, a year earlier. The 1986 quarter included a tax-loss carry-forward of $93,500. Revenue more than doubled to $8.9 million from $3.5 million.    Since the Oct. 19 crash, &quot;the capital markets have been unsettled,&quot; making it difficult to get money by selling equity or other common financing techniques, said Robert A. Fletcher, president and chief executive officer. &quot;Perhaps by joining with a larger company&quot; Enviropact can capitalize on its growth potential, he said.    Mr. Fletcher said demand for Enviropact services has been surging, particularly in its underground gas tank clean-up operations in Florida.    Enviropact also said it issued $5 million of long-term subordinated notes to Union Bank, Los Angeles. It said the financing will enable the company to meet all its current debt obligations.    In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Enviropact closed at $10.375, down $1.75. </TEXT></DOC>
