In order to explore the potentialof this approach for the synthesis of unsaturated sulfides, they haveinvestigated the cross-coupling of alkenylmagnesium halides, obtainedvia the hydromagnesionation of isoprene, with allyl ethers and estersin the presence of elemental sulfur (S{sub 8}, cyclooctasulfane), catalyzedby transition metal complexes. Their experiments revealed that in orderto carry out these types of reactions it was necessary to use two andthree-component catalyst systems based on Pd compounds (Pd(acac){sub2}, PdCl{sub 2}) in conjunction with Ph{sub 3}P, as well as AlET{sub3} or i-Bu{sub 2}AlH.</TEXT></DOC>
