(AMI) of Fairfax,Va.andP;  AMI previously submitted a proposal under the original request forproposals that was evaluated &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in seven of eighttechnical categories.andP;  AMI's technical score was less than half that ofeither EDS or PRC.andM;To make matters worse, AMI was about to graduate from the 8(a) program onAug. 1, 1989.andP;  Energy used a quickie &quot;letter&quot; contract to award theprocurement before AMI's graduation.andP;  Otherwise, AMI would not be eligible onthe first day of contract performance.andM;Energy never made a bona fide determination of what its real requirementswere.andP;  Nor could the agency justify why AMI was now considered responsive.andM;The board members barely could contain their anger at this &quot;sham&quot; strategythat they said showed a &quot;blatant disregard for both the letter and thespirit&quot; of procurement regulations.andM;As punishment, the GSBCA revoked the blanket procurement authority for thisprocurement and made Energy seek a specific delegation of procurementauthority.andM;Also, Energy must get GSA approval on all significant project decisions.andM;The GSBCA has shown no mercy for agencies that ignore or violate its orders.andO;Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Navyand now Energy know it is unwise to counter the GSBCA.andM;Bob Dornan is vice president of Federal Sources Inc., Vienna, Va.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
