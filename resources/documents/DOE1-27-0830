A tool is provided forthe user to make an initial coarse triangulation of a region, which maythen be adaptively refined and load-balanced. DIME provides many graphicsfacilities for examining the mesh, including contouring and a Postscripthard-copy interface. DIME also runs on sequential machines. 8 refs.,18 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
