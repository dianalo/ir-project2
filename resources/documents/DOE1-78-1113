The systems studied include Mn/subx/(CO)/sub y/{sup +} (x = 1-2; y = 0-10, derived from Mn{sub 2}(CO){sub10}), Fe/sub x/(CO)/sub y/{sup +} (x = 3; y = 5-12, derived from Fe{sub3}(CO){sub 12}), and Co/sub x/(CO)/sub y/{sup +} (x = 2-4; y = 0-12,derived from Co{sub 4}(CO){sub 12}). Relative photodissociation crosssections for each ion and upper limits to bond dissociation energiesfor M-M and M-Co are reported. Average metal-metal bond energies forthe Mn{sub 2}(CO)/sub y/{sup +} and Co{sub 4}(CO)/sub y/{sup +} ionsare found to be andless; 44 and 16 kcal/mol, respectively. M-M bond energiescould not be determined for Fe{sub 3}(CO)/sub y/{sup +} ions becausephotodissociation of this system is dominated by expulsion of the COligand. Upper limits for metal-ligand bond energies are andless; 25, 24, and23 kcal/mol for Mn{sub 2}(CO)sub y/{sup +}, Fe{sub 3}(CO)/sub y/{sup+}, and Co{sub 4}(CO)/sub y/{sup +} systems, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
