But bank examiners are only partof a broader problem; what is really needed is to bring backthe energy and animal spirits that produced a growth decade.If President Bush wants to do something about this, he couldcall off the pack of prosecutors, regulators andcontingency-fee lawyers baying at the spoor of the 1980s.   Rudy Giuliani is gone, we know, but the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and Resolution Trust Corp. have inventedtheir own Lawrence Walsh. They've hired Cravath, Swaine andamp;Moore, the firm built by the IBM antitrust defense, to seekrecovery from Michael Milken and his associates for usingjunk bonds to, in the words of one set of legal papers,&quot;spread their gospel of greed to other predators.&quot; Cravathand its star litigators Tom Barr and David Boies will be paidon a contingency-fee basis, plus a retainer that has allowedit to continue as one of the few nonshrinking Wall Streetfirms.</LP><TEXT>   The notion is that Mr. Milken &quot;rigged&quot; the junk-bondmarket, that this caused thrifts to fail and therefore heshould pay the government for the losses it insured. Despitethe string of securities-case reversals by the Second CircuitCourt of Appeals, this theory is being pursued withGiuliani-Walsh fervor.   Regulators dropped their lawsuits against both Drexel andColumbia Savings andamp; Loan in exchange for testimony against Mr.Milken; we suppose Fred Joseph and Thomas Spiegel aresupposed to say they were duped into letting Mr. Milken makehuge profits for them. Cravath now represents both Drexel andColumbia Savings in their separate suits against Mr. Milken.This month's modest proposal is that Drexel pay Mr. Joseph$300,000 a year to help testify against his former rainmaker.The lawsuits add Lowell Milken as a defendant. As part of theMilken plea bargain, the Justice Department agreed not toprosecute Lowell Milken, but now another part of thegovernment is hiring Cravath to do precisely that.   Now, as for the economic merits of the case: How couldjunk bonds have caused the Sandamp;L crisis when only 2% of thriftsever owned any of these bonds? Everyone anticipated that junkbonds would have higher than normal default rates; that iswhy they paid high rates of interest. But the big collapsedidn't come until Congress, likely not understanding theconsequences of its actions, passed legislation in 1989 thatforced the thrifts to mark their junk bonds to market andquickly sell them. This instantly depressed the junk-bondmarket -- at least temporarily.   To the consternation of the RTC, which sold many of itsforeclosed junk bonds at the low point in the market, junkbonds are back. The Merrill Lynch bond index indicates thatcorporate junk bonds now pay an average yield of 13%, nearlytwice the return for higher-quality corporates. Junk-bondfunds have been the best performers in the fixed-income groupthis year, with several funds producing returns of nearly50%. More than $3 billion of junk bonds have been sold in thepublic markets already this year, twice last year's amount.We wouldn't be surprised if some of the thrifts that ran intotrouble when they had to dump their junk bonds would besolvent now if they had been allowed to hold on to the bondsuntil the political attacks passed. Perhaps a governmentlawyer can explain to a jury how these mau-maued, supposedlycrooked bonds have had a better return over the past fiveyears than low-risk Treasurys.   More than 100 investment banks marketed junk bonds, andthere have been about 1,000 issues where Drexel was notinvolved. The rate of default for Drexel's junk bonds, about15%, is well below the rates for Merrill Lynch (31%), SalomonBrothers (26%) or Goldman Sachs (22%), according to a Salomonreport last spring. Cravath itself advised investment banksin junk-bond deals -- including such failures as Campeau andGeneral Development. None of this matters in the thirst forrevenge against a symbol, or for contingency-fee settlements.   If you wonder what this has to do with the &quot;creditcrunch,&quot; remember that only 1,000 companies in the nationcarry investment-grade bond ratings. These large establishedcompanies are getting more efficient by paring their workforces. They did the same thing in the 1980s, but a surge ofnew entrepreneurial companies led to the net creation of 18.5million jobs between 1982 and 1989. Today we don't have suchcompanies. Their junk-bond financing has been suppressed, andbanks are penalized for &quot;highly leveraged transactions.&quot; Thestupor spreads through the economy.   It's more than a coincidence that the credit crunch beganwhen ambitious prosecutors decided that a financialinstrument was a criminal racketeering enterprise. And eventoday, the bloodhounds are sending the chilling message thatanyone who takes risks in this marketplace can lose more thanmoney.</TEXT></DOC>
