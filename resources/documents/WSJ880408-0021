The Dow Jones Industrial Average chalked up its third consecutive advance by rising 0.50 to 2062.17. The average, which jumped more than 64 points Wednesday, added nearly 17 points Tuesday.    Broader market averages posted stronger showings. Standard andamp; Poor's 500Stock Index climbed 0.67 to 266.16 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.52 to 150.28.    Some 988 issues advanced on the Big Board and 541 declined. Big Board volume totaled 177.8 million shares, compared with 189.8 million Wednesday.    Traders said the market spent the session locked in a struggle between buyers who viewed the latest rally favorably and sellers who saw the upturn as an opportunity to take profits, especially in the blue chips.    The conflict was evident from the opening bell, as the market started out mixed despite expectations of another solid advance. Prices then turned higher -- short-covering was one factor, traders said -- but stocks quickly gave up those gains and didn't make much progress after that.    The market was characterized by &quot;very cautious buying and selling into strength on rallies,&quot; said Ed Shopkorn, director of institutional equities at Mabon Nugent.    With the bond market and the dollar failing to follow through on their advances of Wednesday and the level of conviction among investors remaining relatively low, Mr. Shopkorn said &quot;none of the fundamentals have really changed. The uncertainty is still there.&quot;    Even so, the Dow industrials managed to record their first three-session winning streak since mid-March, when the average rose a total of about 40 points to reach its highest level since last October's market crash -- 2087.37.    Secondary issues posted gains that were in line with the broad market's performance. The American Stock Exchange Index added 1.80 points and the Nasdaq OTC Composite Index advanced 1.14 points.    One factor in the market's favor at the moment, analysts say, is evidence that the widespread fears of a further increase in interest rates aren't likely to be realized.    Wednesday's report that the Group of Seven industrial countries will support the dollar at the 125-yen level was viewed as a sign that the Federal Reserve won't have to tighten monetary policy to accomplish that goal, which would cause rates to move higher.    Also, analysts view the 3.20-point advance in the Dow Jones Utilities Average Wednesday as an early indication that lower rates lie ahead. The average, one of the few market indexes that is below its level at the start of 1988, fell 0.18 yesterday to 174.37.    William M. LeFevre, a market strategist with Advest Inc., Hartford, Conn., said these developments have eased the market's concerns about an upturn in inflation, which have been rampant in recent weeks.    Noting that investors already have set aside their fears of recession because of signs of continued economic growth, he said Wednesday's surge could be the first sign of a &quot;spring stampede&quot; into stocks. The &quot;trigger device&quot; for such a move, he said, would be frustration on the part of institutions that have held high cash levels in their portfolios in anticipation of another plunge in stock prices.    Mr. LeFevre said an advance past 2100 on the Dow industrials is to be expected at this point, with the 2200 level posing more of a challenge for the market. Should stocks overcome that barrier, he said, the market could see the mirror image of last fall's &quot;professional panic&quot; that led to the October crash.    Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said he expects the market to stage that type of sharp move eventually, with the Dow average adding &quot;several hundred points&quot; on a rally led by cyclical and heavy industry stocks.    However, Mr. Solomon asserted that the dollar, bonds or commodities will have to remain steady in order for stocks to fulfill that expectation. &quot;With these things stable, inflation will not break through. Then equities can have a wholesome environment,&quot; he said.    He added that although the market's underlying support can be seen in its upward move from the lows reached in early December, stocks will have to go through another period of consolidation before a surge in prices gets under way.    Irving Bank jumped 3 3/4 to 67 7/8. Court papers filed by Goldman Sachs, one of Irving's financial advisers, disclosed that the bank holding company is in discussions with possible &quot;white knights&quot; in its efforts to avoid a hostile takeover by Bank of New York.    American depositary shares of Barclays PLC, rumored to be a candidate for that role, plunged 3 5/8 to 32 1/2. The British banking concern began a rights issue of 369.5 million ordinary shares at the equivalent of $4.68 each, well below the stock's current price. Each American share represents four ordinary shares. In response to the rumors, Barclays said it hadn't talked with Irving and doesn't plan any major acquisitions.    Sears Roebuck, which reported a 1.5% rise in March retail sales, fell 1/8 to 37. F.W. Woolworth gained 7/8 to 55 3/4; its March sales jumped 29%. Among other top retailers, K mart rose 1/2 to 35 3/4, J.C. Penney added 1/2 to 49 1/4 and Wal-Mart gained 1/8 to 28 7/8.    Lucky Stores, which rejected American Stores' $45-a-share takeover offer and its proposal to raise the bid to $50, jumped 3 3/4 to 52 1/2. The company said it plans to consider its sale to a third party, a recapitalization and a reorganization as alternatives to the offer.    SSMC advanced 1 7/8 to 30 1/8. Singer, its former parent, boosted its stake in the company to about 27% from 15% by converting its SSMC preferred stock into common. Also, Singer said it will solicit bids for its SSMC shares or the entire company, and may consider seeking control of the company itself. Singer closed unchanged at 49 3/4.    UNC Inc. surged 2 5/8 to 10 3/4. Odyssey Partners said it holds a 5.8% stake in the company and may seek control. The partnership said it proposed a leveraged buyout of UNC in February, but the company wasn't interested.    Greyhound added 1 1/2 to 31 5/8. An analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell placed a takeover value of more than $50 a share and a fundamental value of $45 a share on the company.    Genentech lost 1 1/4 to 36 1/4 following the Ontario Medical Association's recommendation Wednesday that its members avoid using TPA, the company's anti-clotting drug, because of its high price.    Computer Sciences fell 1 7/8 to 44 5/8. First Boston lowered its investment rating on the stock and reduced its fiscal 1989 earnings estimate to $3.30 a share from $3.45.    The American Stock Exchange Index advanced 1.80 to 299.38.    Lorimar Telepictures closed at 15 1/4, up 1 1/8, on volume of 515,700 shares, making it the most active issue on the Amex. The television and movie production concern is talking with Warner Communications Inc. about possibly being acquired by Warner.    Crowley, Milner gained 2 to 29. A holder of a 12.8% stake in the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Crowley should be sold to maximize shareholder value.    Vermont American gained 2 1/4 to 23 1/2.    Newell Co. said in an SEC filing that it holds a 5.5% stake in Vermont American's common shares outstanding and may buy more for investment purposes. Newell was up 3/4 to 40 on the Big Board. </TEXT></DOC>
