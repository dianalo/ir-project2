The move by the U.S.'s third-largest bank holding company will result in estimated losses of $1.4 billion for the second quarter and $850 million for the year, Chase officials said.    The Chase decision, announced late yesterday, comes just eight days after Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, shocked the banking world by saying it would add $3 billion to its loan-loss reserve, citing shaky foreign loans.    Despite regulators' assertions that Citicorp's decision wouldn't pressure other banks to make similar provisions, analysts had expected most well-capitalized banks to follow Citicorp's lead. On Tuesday, Norwest Corp., a large regional bank based in Minneapolis, said it would boost its loan-loss reserve by $200 million.    &quot;We looked at the whole (less-developed country) debt problem and concluded conditions had changed,&quot; Chase's chairman and chief executive officer, Willard C. Butcher, said in an interview yesterday. He referred particularly to Brazil's Feb. 20 suspension of interest payments on its foreign bank debts. Chase's move increases its loan-loss reserve to $2.7 billion, or 4.1% of its total loans, well above the industry average.    &quot;I think this underscores the fact that the less-developed country situation requires changed thinking on the adequacy of reserves, and we expect other banks to take similar actions,&quot; said James J. McDermott Jr., senior analyst at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks.    Bank analysts said they expect similar moves soon from several other big bank holding companies, including Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical New York Corp., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Mellon Bank Corp. Such moves would further isolate BankAmerica Corp., the one major U.S. bank holding company which has said -- in the wake of Citicorp's move -- that it considers its current level of reserves adequate.    A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover said, &quot;The matter is under careful review.&quot;    Spokesmen for Bankers Trust and Chemical declined to comment on whether their banks would increase reserves.    A Mellon spokesman said the bank &quot;was continuing to scrutinize&quot; its loan-loss reserve.    Analysts said they expect big banks to increase their loan-loss reserves to levels close to those of Citicorp. With its $3 billion reserve addition, Citicorp increased its loan-loss reserve to 3.68% of total loans, or 25% of its total Latin American loans, plus an allowance for loss reserves to fully cover nonperforming loans elsewhere in the world.    Chase's boost to its reserve, which comes out of retained earnings, means its loan-loss reserve now totals about 25% of its loans to countries with debt problems.    Mr. Butcher said Chase management had been reviewing its loan-loss reserve for some months. He said five specific factors had caused management to decide Monday to increase the reserve. Chase's board approved the measure Tuesday.    The developments Mr. Butcher listed are the uncertain world economic outlook; difficulties in recent debt restructurings to Latin American countries, such as increasingly low interest margins, the difference between a bank's cost of funds and the rate it charges borrowers; lack of progress with some developing countries' economic programs; Brazil's suspension of interest payments on its foreign bank debt; and the effect of Citicorp's recent reserve decision.    Chase said its expected $850 million loss for 1987 is based on its current estimates for full-year results, which it didn't break down; a partial tax benefit from the reserve increase; and expected gains of about $100 million from the sale of assets.    Tax benefits from the increased loss reserve will total $150 million this year, with a remaining $400 million in expected tax benefits spread over four subsequent years, a Chase spokesman said.    As to which assets will be sold, a Chase spokesman said &quot;no decision has been reached,&quot; but noted the sales could include property as well as securities.    The loss-reserve increase won't change Chase's current dividend, the company said. Citicorp also maintained its current dividend policy after its $3 billion loss-reserve boost. However, Chase's reserve action will cut the book value of its common stock to $36 a share in the second quarter, from $53.35 in the first quarter.    Increasing capital is also a priority for Chase. The bank said in a statement detailing the reserve increase that, in addition to plans for the $100 million gain on asset sales, Chase intends to sell other assets over the coming months. Those sales would realize after-tax gains of between $200 million and $300 million, which would be used to increase capital.    At March 31, Chase had total capital of $9.8 billion, or 9.9% of assets. Its primary capital totaled $6.9 billion, or 7% of assets. In 1986, Chase earned $585.3 million, or $6.63 a share.    ---                 Following Citicorp's Lead                 (In billions of dollars)                                   Reserve Increase Required                                   To Cover 25% of Latin                  Present          Loans And 100% of Other                  Loan-Loss        Nonperforming Loans                  Reserve Citicorp           $4.90                     $0.00 BankAmerica Corp.               2.17                      3.01 Chase Manhattan Corp.               2.72                      1.00 J.P.
