Roberts (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MLL </CO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bankers Trust Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. pledged to provide or help arrange financing for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s proposed $85-a-share, or $2.36 billion, leveraged buy-out of Macmillan Inc., Macmillan said.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Macmillan also said Kohlberg pledged $250 million in equity financing and as much as $230 million in a subordinated bridge loan, both from limited partnerships.    Macmillan said it agreed to pay Kohlberg $29.3 million and unspecified out-of-pocket expenses if the proposed buy-out is derailed by any rival takeover offer. As previously reported, Macmillan agreed to Kohlberg's leveraged buy-out to try to avoid a takeover by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass or British media executive Robert Maxwell. They have separate offers in effect, for $75 a share and $80 a share, respectively.    A Kohlberg unit is expected to launch a tender offer this week for most of the shares outstanding of the book publishing and information services concern.    According to Macmillan, Bankers Trust committed to lend the Kohlberg unit, MI Holdings Inc., as much as $500 million and to use its best efforts to form a banking syndicate that would lend an additional $1.48 billion. The equity financing and bridge loan from the Kohlberg limited partnerships would be provided when tendered shares are to be purchased, Macmillan said. KKR Associates, an affiliate of Kohlberg, is the general partner of the limited partnerships.    Drexel expressed confidence that it can privately place or underwrite a public offering of debt securities totaling as much as $960 million, Macmillan said. Of those proceeds, $230 million would be used to repay the Kohlberg bridge loan and the rest would go to reduce the bank debt, said Charles G. McCurdy, Macmillan's vice president, corporate finance.    Analysts have speculated that Macmillan would sell assets to raise as much as $1 billion to reduce debt after the leveraged buy-out. In outlining the financing in the SEC filing, however, the company didn't mention any such sales. </TEXT></DOC>
