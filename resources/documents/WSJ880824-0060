Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign-exchange traders and central bankers battled to a near stalemate in the continuing tug-of-war over the dollar, yet the U.S. currency continued its climb with a slight gain yesterday.    As central banks sold dollars to push the currency lower, traders moved in on the dips to take advantage of the depressed prices. But traders had difficulty mustering enough momentum to drive the dollar up much.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.9120 marks, up from 1.9075 marks Monday, and at 134.13 yen, up from 133.66 yen. In Tokyo on Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened at 134.25 yen. Late Tuesday in New York, the pound traded at $1.6745, down from $1.6860 Monday.    &quot;The central banks are really causing the markets to be uncomfortable with buying the dollar at this time,&quot; said Ronald H. Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago. &quot;Yet, I think that will wane over time. I think the market will gain confidence as we hold 1.90 (marks).&quot;    But traders contend that most of the activity is among financial institutions, with corporate customers likely to sit it out until after Labor Day. &quot;There's no real customer flow,&quot; said Richard E. Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., New York. &quot;Labor Day will change that; when the world is in full swing, you'll get more players.&quot;    Traders said there was widespread intervention by a number of European central banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve, fueling belief that 1.90 marks is the level set by the central banks in their most recent accord. One trader added that reported intervention by the central banks in some of Europe's smaller countries shows the banks' concern.    &quot;Certainly, the central banks have been meeting very regularly by telephone,&quot; said Garrett R. Glass, vice president at First National Bank of Chicago. &quot;They wouldn't have dragged in all the peripheral players if there wasn't something in the Louvre accord that suggests this is the tops for the dollar.&quot;    The dollar's recent rise -- from about 1.83 marks in late July -- has been propelled by rising U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to foreign buyers. &quot;The capital outflow out of {West} Germany has been tremendous,&quot; Mr. Witten said.    Several West German economists said they expect the Bundesbank to opt for another rise in German interest rates to support the mark. That speculation came on the heels of yesterday's announcement that West Germany's June trade surplus jumped to a record 14.2 billion marks ($7.45 billion), a 38% increase from the May figure.    Moreover, the Fed's relatively tight monetary policy, coupled with signs of an inflation rate of about 5%, continue to create fundamentals that are attractive for the dollar, Harris's Mr. Holzer said.    &quot;I would not expect the dollar to come down sharply until the employment situation and the economic situation in the U.S. begin to slow in a significant way,&quot; Mr. Holzer said. &quot;Those factors are still very much in favor with the dollar.&quot;    Traders said that if the dollar pierces the psychologically significant 1.92-mark level, it could run to 1.95 or even 2.0 marks in the next couple of months. The 1.92 level has emerged as a resistance level for the dollar several times in the past year.    &quot;If we eventually go through that level, the central banks are in trouble,&quot; First National's Mr. Glass said, adding that &quot;1.92 has almost a mystical import for the market.&quot;    About the only major central bank reported not to have intervened yesterday was the Bank of Japan, which maintained its recent isolationism in international monetary policy. Japan also has kept its official discount rate, the rate at which it lends to banks, at a historic low level of 2.5% as other nations have lifted theirs.    A senior Bank of Japan official said, &quot;We are in close contact with other central banks and exchange information on a daily basis.&quot; But he added that based on a mutual assessment of market conditions, &quot;we have not seen a need to intervene.&quot;    The dollar has remained relatively steady against the yen, staying in a range of 130 to 135 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $432.20 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimated volume was a light 2.2 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $432.40 an ounce.    ---   Marcus W.
