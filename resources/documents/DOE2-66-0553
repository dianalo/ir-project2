<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0553 </DOCNO><TEXT>The rf systems for linear accelerators or storage rings use electronicallyvariable phase shifters as control elements in feedback loops or to setreference phases. A variety of electronic phase shifters has been describedin literature. One desirable feature of these devices is a linear responseof the phase shift as a function of their control voltage. This reportdescribes the design of 180{degrees} phase shifters at 1300 MHz and 353MHz using voltage variable capacitance diodes as terminations in transmissionlines. The optimization of paramenters is discussed with emphasis onlinearity, power handling capability and temperature stability. 9 refs.,9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
