<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-11-0958 </DOCNO><TEXT>SPECTROM-58 is a finite element computer code for computing brine transportin rock salt for two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. The theoreticalbasis for the mathematical model, the implementation of the mathematicalmodel into the computer code, the verification and validation effortswith the computer code, and the code support and continuing documentationare described in this documentation. The mathematical model employedin SPECTROM-58 allows for two distinct brine transport mechanisms, aswell as the coupling between the two mechanisms. Transport within individualsalt crystals is assumed to be governed by the differential solubilityof salt resulting from thermal gradients. Brine inclusions exit the saltcrystals and enter the salt grain boundary space or pore space when asufficient temperature gradient exists to allow such motion. Transportof brine within the interconnected salt pore space is the result of brinepressure gradients. Several verification problems for SPECTROM-58 areprovided in this documentation. The results of a simulation of a benchscale brine migration experiment are also included and a typical repositoryproblem is solved with SPECTROM-58.</TEXT></DOC>
