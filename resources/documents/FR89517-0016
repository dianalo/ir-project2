L. 100-242, approved February 5, 1988) andin the HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202,approved December 22, 1987). The rule amended the UDAG regulations (24CFR Part 570) by modifying the project selection criteria for UDAG fundsand the definition of eligible cities. The new selection system was expectedto spread UDAG funds to more areas of the country. The rule became effectiveOctober 6, 1988. Congress has not authorized any appropriation for the UDAG program forFY 1989. However, funds recaptured from previous years will be used tofund the two remaining funding rounds: July 1989 for small cities, withapplications due by May 31, 1989, and September 1989 for large cities andurban counties, with applications due by July 31, 1989. A Notice of theUDAG funding rounds for FY 1989 was published on November 2, 1988 (53 FR44186). It is estimated that approximately $50 million will be availablefor these two funding rounds. (The changes to the selection system describedin this rule will not affect the funding round for small cities.) This interim rule amends the UDAG project selection system described in24 CFR 570.459 to: (1) Reduce the number of points that may be awardedunder three selection criteria; (2) add two new criteria; and (3) adjusttwo existing criteria. The changes reflect the Secretary's priorities toaddress critical needs for housing and economic development. The rule makes the following changes with respect to point reduction: 1. <T3>Leveraging ratio_</T3>Reduces the maximum point value from 10 pointsto 8 points. While the leveraging ratio of private funds to UDAG fundsis a key factor in the UDAG program, HUD believes that 8 points will givesufficient emphasis since this selection criterion still retains the highestnumber of points of all the criteria. 2. <T3>UDAG funds per new permanent job--</T3>Reduces the maximum point valuefrom 7 points to 6 points. This reduction will not have a significant effecton this selection criterion. The creation or retention of jobs is clearlya main focus of the UDAG program, as reflected by the existence of severalother selection criteria related to jobs and their associated points. 3. <T3>State/local funds per UDAG dollar--</T3>Reduces the maximum point valuefrom 2 points to 1 point. Other State/local criteria are added to strengthenthe targeting of State/local funding. The three changes described above will make available four rating pointsthat are used to add two new criteria and to adjust two existing criteria.The following criteria are added: 1. <T3>Tax incentives for development or rehabilitation of housing for low-and moderate-income persons--</T3>1 point. Projects that use State/localtax incentives to promote the development or rehabilitation of housingfor low- and moderate-income persons by the private sector may receiveone point. This criterion is directly related to the statutory criterionin section 119(d)(1)(C)(vii) concerning the extent to which State or localgovernment special economic incentives have been committed. 2. <T3>State/local funds for homeownership--</T3>1 point. Projects that commitState/local funds to homeownership for first-time buyers may receive onepoint. This criterion also relates to the statutory criterion in section119(d)(1)(C)(vii) regarding the extent to which State or local fundinghas been committed to the project. Attention to this factor in the ratingprocess recognizes the pressing need for action to assist first-time homebuyers by making housing more affordable. The following adjustments are made in existing criteria: 1. <T3>State-designated enterprise zones. </T3>The existing UDAG selectionsystem awards one point for projects that are located within a FederalEnterprise Zone andSection; 570.459(e)(11), designated in accordance withTitle VII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. This interimrule will add to this criterion enterprise zones designated in accordancewith a State law, State executive order, or State plan that recognizesdistressed areas and encourages or offers incentives for private investmentthat will create jobs and assist in the economic revitalization of theareas. The point value for this criterion is increased to two. This relatesdirectly to the statutory criterion in section 119(d)(1)(C)(vii) regardingthe extent to which State/local funding or special economic incentiveshave been committed to the project. This adjustment to the existing criterion gives State-designated enterprisezones the recognition and support that they deserve. Enterprise zones encourageentrepreneurship and job creation in distressed areas, a major goal ofany economic development effort. Therefore, projects located in Federal(if applicable) or in State-designated enterprise zones may receive twopoints in the project selection system.2. <T3>Sheltering the homeless. </T3>There is clear national concern aboutthe problem of the homeless, which requires a mobilization of Federal,State, local, and private sector resources to address this crucial issue.This rule will change the selection system to award an additional pointunder the existing criterion ``Pressing residential need'' (andSection; 570.459(e)(8))for projects that provide direct assistance for sheltering the homeless.(This criterion relates to the statutory criterion in section 119(d)(1)(C)(v)concerning pressing residential need.) To be eligible for this additionalpoint, applications must meet the statutory standard in andSection; 570.459(e)(8)(ii)(A) and (B), as well as demonstrate that the project will also providedirect assistance for sheltering the homeless. The Department will apply the additional criteria described in this ruleto the Large Cities and Urban Counties funding round for the UDAG program,for which applications are to be received during July and funding decisionsmade in September 1989. The Secretary has determined that the concernsof providing affordable housing for low and moderate income families, shelteringthe homeless, and encouraging economic development in areas that are recognizedas economically distressed are sufficiently critical to make these changesto the rule effective for the last funding round in this fiscal year. Thechange is a limited one, and its effects on the program are easily understood.Accordingly, the Department has determined that good cause exists for makingthe changes by interim rule. The public is invited to comment on the changes,and the comments will be considered in promulgating a final rule beforeany subsequent funding rounds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>The collection of information requirements for the UDAG program have beensubmitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980. Information on the burden hours for these requirements isprovided as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7,7,7 </C>   <H1>Burden </H1><H1>Number of responses </H1><H1>Responses per respondent </H1><H1>Hours per response </H1><H1>Annual total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Application <D>200 </D><D>1.3 </D><D>32.2 </D><D>8,372</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The collection of information requirements contained in this rule comprise52 hours of the annual total of 8,372 burden hours. A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding is available for public inspection during regular business hoursin the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 issued by the President on February17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that it will not (1) have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have a significantadverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), the Undersigned certifiesthat this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because the number of affected small entitiesis not substantial. The funding for the UDAG program is not a substantialamount and the effect of the changes will be neutral on the competitiveposition of small entities. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>has determined that the policies contained in thisrule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject toreview under the Order. The rule amends the UDAG selection criteria_a changethat has neither substantial nor direct effects on cities and urban countiesin their role as governmental entities. The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>Family, </T3>has determined that this rule may have a potential significantimpact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, to theextent that UDAG funds are targeted for projects that promote economicdevelopment, the creation and retention of jobs, and affordable housing,all of which in turn promote the maintenance and well-being of families.Any family impact will be positive.
