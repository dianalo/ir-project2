Great Eagle Co. bid $346 million for the 95,000-square-foot lot,the last major tract of downtown land expected to be sold by thegovernment before 1997, when Britain returns Hong Kong to China.   Hong Kong government property sales are carefully scrutinizedbecause of the importance the real estate market plays in thecolony's economy and the disproportionate significance propertygroups have on the stock exchange.   The property had been expected to fetch perhaps as much as $641million before Chinese troops on June 3-4 crushed the pro-democracymovement, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.   But China's suppression has increased fears about the colony'sfuture under Chinese rule and, since the crackdown, estimates onthe winning bid had been around $385 million or slightly higher.   Bob Pope, acting director of the government's Buildings andLands Department, said he was ``satisfied'' with the winning bid inview of recent events in China, even though it was below his Aprilestimate of $513 million.   ``I regard it as a vote of confidence in the future,'' he saidof the winning bid, noting that the entire project involves aninvestment of about $641 million. Great Eagle is expected to buildtwo office towers on the site.   ``The sort of returns that are expected probably equate to adrop in the market somewhat, but not as great as indicated in thepress,'' he said.   The stock market fell sharply on Friday when news began to leakabout the bids for the lot. It closed today at 2489.03, a modestdrop from Tuesday's 2517.02 closing.</TEXT></DOC>
