(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As the sun rises over Kelly Mountain, minesuperintendent Ronnie Gibson drives past union pickets at the crestof the hill and takes his place amid machinery idled by a wildcatstrike.   When his neighbor, Junie Dials, tries to reach the same IslandCreek Corp. mine at the start of his evening shift, he gets nofurther than the pickets and retreats to Buddy's Carryout in nearbyAccoville.   It's a script they expect to follow as long as wildcat strikes in10 states continue against coal companies, including the IslandCreek mine here in southern West Virginia about 50 miles south ofCharleston.   ``I have to make an attempt to go,'' Dials said, sneaking acigarette at the Buddy's lunch counter Tuesday. ``Our contract sayswe have to go to work.'' A union contract, however, doesn't meanmuch these days in the coal fields. Despite a no-strike clause intheir pact, 28,000 United Mine Workers members have walked off thejob in sympathy with striking Pittston Coal Group Inc. workers inVirginia, West Virgina and Kentucky.   As Tuesday wound down, Gibson and Dials returned to their homes15 miles away in Man _ Gibson to his tan, wooden home on BurgessStreet; Dials to the big white house just around the corner on MainStreet. They got together later at Gibson's house to talk about theday.   ``I have no idea when I'll be back at work,'' Dials said. ``I'dbe tickled to death to go back to work. I want to work.''   Each day, the 40-year-old Dials has driven to the top of KellyMountain and, each day, a half-dozen union pickets with bandannascovering their faces tell him to turn back. Gibson, 48, said he hashad no trouble with the strikers after telling them he is asupervisor. Beyond that, he has been instructed not to talk.   ``I can't even tell you my name is Ronnie Gibson,'' he said inthe quiet office of the Island Creek mine.   At Accoville, where he grew up with Gibson, Dials looksexasperated when he leans on Buddy's shining lunch counter.   ``I see the ayatollah released our three men down in Virginiatoday,'' Dials said, referring to a federal judge. ``I was tickledto death about it. I thought they were going to let me go back towork.''   The three union leaders in Virginia were jailed after U.S.District Judge Glen Williams found them guilty of contempt of courtfor violating his ban on attempts to block coal trucks at Pittston'sprocessing plants in Virginia.   They were freed by Williams after promising during a privatehearing Tuesday to abide by his order.   In its dispute with the UMW, the Lebanon, Va.,-based Pittston isseeking a contract separate from one covering most of the nation'scoal companies. Pittson is seeking mandatory overtime, Sunday workand reduced medical benefits for retirees.   About 1,600 Pittston miners in Virginia and West Virginia walkedoff their jobs April 5 after working more than 14 months without acontract. Kentucky's 200 Pittston miners joined the walkout Monday.   There's been little sympathy for Pittston in West Virginia'sLogan County since 1972 when a 200-foot-high Pittston coal refusedam broke, wiping the sides of the Buffalo Creek Valley black andtaking 125 people to their deaths.   ``Pittston didn't show no sympathy when they killed 125 peoplehere,'' Dials said. ``I'd like to see them run out of the hollow.''   The state sued Pittston, which settled out of court for $1million.   ``I don't think they'll ever have a friend in this hollowagain,'' Dials said.</TEXT></DOC>
