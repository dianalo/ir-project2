Nearly half of this money _ 47 percent _ was channeled tomembers of the four military committees in Congress, according toFederal Election Commission reports. Members of these panelsreceived average contributions of $1,293.   The reports also show how, in some cases, the defensecontractors have been able to legally provide money to lawmakersthey would not legally be able to give to other governmentofficials.   The principal beneficiaries are the lawmakers who make crucialdecisions about Pentagon spending and procurement prioritiesthrough their memberships on the House and Senate armed servicescommittees and defense appropriations subcommittees.   Last year, 37 of the 101 members who serve on the four militarycommittees reported receiving about $137,100 in speaking fees fromdefense contractors publicly linked to the Pentagon probe.   All but $10,000 went to the House side of the Capitol, with 33members _ Democrats and Republicans alike _ averaging $3,852 eachin so-called honoraria.   Speaking fees are legal on Capitol Hill, but they are forbiddenby law among executive branch officials. Senators can pocket up to$35,800 a year in such outside income, House members up to $26,850.   The Associated Press surveyed the 1987 financial disclosurestatements of committee members and campaign contribution reportsfiled with the Federal Election Commission for the 1988, 1986 and1984 elections.   The reports were filed by political action committees maintainedby six of the defense contractors who have been searched underwarrants issued in the massive probe of alleged Pentagonprocurement fraud and bribery.   They are McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 defensecontractor; Litton Industries; United Technologies-Pratt and Whitney;Northrop; Cubic Corp. and Hazeltine Corp.   The survey hit only the tip of the iceberg. The companies tiedso far to the probe are part of a huge defense industry, withdozens of others routinely making campaign contributions and payinghonoraria to members of Congress.   Congressional leaders said last week that they had been told bythe chief prosecutor, Henry Hudson, that no lawmakers were targetsof the 2-year-old investigation or had their records seized by theFBI.   The destination of the speaking fees _ often accompanied by freetrips for lawmakers and their spouses to defense plants and resorts_ tells a lot about where the real power of the Pentagon purse lieson Capitol Hill.   Twenty-two of the 52 members of House Armed Services reportedgetting speaking fees from the surveyed defense contractors. Thispanel sets broad policy and authorizes items like weapons systems.   But a new tank is worthless unless there is money to build it,and that money on the House side of the Capitol comes from thesmallest military panel in Congress, the 11-member House defenseappropriations subcommittee headed by Rep. William Chappell, D-Fla.   Last year, Chappell and eight colleagues on the subcommitteereported getting $46,250 _ an average of $5,138 apiece _ fromcontractors tied to the investigation.   Chappell may head the committee, but he wasn't the favoritespeaker among the contractors with subpoenaed records. That wasRep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who said he collected $8,000 for fourappearances. Chappell reported $4,000.   Others on the subcommittee getting money from the surveyedcontractors included Reps. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, $7,000; LesAuCoin, D-Ore., $6,250; Bob Livingston, D-La., $6,000; and BillYoung, R-Fla., $6,000.   Young's disclosure statement illustrated a practice amongdefense contractors, who may fight each other for Pentagon jobs butcan cooperate when it comes to taking a lawmaker on a grand tour.   Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 16, 1987, nine contractors _ seven ofthem not named in the probe _ shared the costs of flying, housingand feeding Young for a trip that included visits to facilities inCalifornia and Texas.   For nine speeches in the five-day stretch, Young picked up$13,000 in honoraria, according to his disclosure statement.   Speaking fees are small change for defense contractors comparedto what they pour into campaign treasuries, especially those ofmilitary committee members.   The biggest spread was in 1983-4 by Northrop's PAC: an averageof $2,014 for members of military committees, $876 for non-members.   Again, the defense appropriations subcommittees were favored PACtargets. The average contribution to a lawmaker on these panels was$1,866.   House defense appropriations was all-but blanketed with PACmoney, with funds usually going to eight or more of the 11 members.For the 18-member Senate counterpart, no PAC gave to more thaneight members in the same election cycle.   A PAC can give a candidate up to $10,000 in each two-yearelection cycle. The survey found three instances: Northrop's PAC toSen. John Warner, R-Va., in 1984 and United Technologies-Pratt andamp;Whitney's PAC to Warner and Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the sameyear.   Military committee members consistently gettinghigher-than-average PAC contributions included Sen. Pete Wilson,R-Calif.; Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Murtha; Chappell; Rep. RoyDyson, D-Md.; and Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala.   Two lawmakers on Armed Services committees _ Sen. Lawton Chiles,D-Fla., and Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. _ took neither honorarianor PAC money from the defense contractors identified with theinvestigation, the records showed.</TEXT></DOC>
