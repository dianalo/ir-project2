On Wednesday, after Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega calledoff a 19-month cease-fire, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidregarding the possibility of seeking military aid for the rebels,``We don't want to go that route. We want to get free elections.''   Bush had appeared on Tuesday to leave the door to military aidopen when he specifically declined during a news conference to ruleit out.   After his visit to Duarte, who is thought to be near death fromstomach cancer, Bush also accused Nicaragua of ``armed subversion''of its neighbors.   ``It's not clear how far Ortega intends to take his military andintimidation campaign. Accordingly, we must and we will leave ouroptions open,'' he said.   Pressed to elaborate, Bush said only that he would let hisstatement stand for itself. Congress cut off military aid to theContras in February 1988 but has approved humanitarian aid for therebels through February, when Nicaragua is scheduled to holdnational elections.   Bush said it was hypocritical for Ortega to expect the Contrasto disband and return home voluntarily ``while sending in vastarmed forces to attack them.''   The administration issued different assessments of Ortega'soffer to hold talks between Sandinista officials and the Contrasnext week at the United Nations.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the U.N. talks``a positive sign, something we've called for all along.''   Bosco Matamoros, a rebel spokesman in Washington, had saidThursday that the rebel leaders in Honduras had accepted Ortega'soffer. The State Department called the move a propaganda ploybecause it came on the heels of Ortega's cancellation of thecease-fire. There have been no direct contacts between Sandinistaand Contra officials for more than a year.   But Fitzwater reacted differently today.   ``What we'd like to see is for these positive steps to lead to areinstatement of the cease-fire and to get President Ortega tocreate a climate in Nicaragua for democracy and repatriation,''Fitzwater said.   Fitzwater spoke to reporters while traveling with Bush aboardAir Force One to Richmond, Va.   Sentiment on Capitol Hill appears to be strongly opposed torestoring military aid to the rebels, although the House, often abastion of anti-Contra sentiment, blamed the Sandinistas Thursdayfor the escalation in fighting in Nicaragua.   The State Department said two military operations launched bythe Sandinistas were ``large-scale'' and involved the use ofartillery and attack helicopters.   The House resolution called on Ortega to ``cease his recklessrhetoric'' and said Nicaragua's leaders must fulfill commitments to``end their aggression in the region, end their tyranny over theirown people and permit the establishment of democracy insideNicaragua.''   Meanwhile, Ortega and the U.S. State Department offered sharplyconflicting versions of the reasons behind a recent reinfiltrationof an estimated 2,000 Contras into Nicaragua from base camps inHonduras.   The State Department said the rebels' intentions were peacefulbut Ortega forcefully disagreed.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, citing reports fromContra leaders, said about 2,000 rebels have reinfiltrated intoNicaragua in recent weeks. A Pentagon estimate said about 4,000Contras are now in Nicaragua and 10,000 others remain in Honduras.   Boucher said one purpose for the reinfiltration was to encourageContra supporters to register to vote. Other officials, insistingon anonymity, said a number of Contras, worried about a CentralAmerican plan to demobilize them, decided to return on their ownbecause they feared they might be forced back against their willlater without arms to protect them.   In a column in Thursday's New York Times, Ortega contended theContras were trying to subvert the electoral process because ``theyare as convinced as I am ... that the Nicaraguan people will givethe Sandinistas a landslide victory'' in the elections.   He said that during October, Contra units closed more than 50voter registration centers, preventing thousands of citizens fromregistering.   ``They targeted for assassination known Sandinista supporters _prominent community leaders, party activists and candidates formunicipal offices _ and slit their throats,'' Ortega wrote.   But Boucher said there was no basis for that version.   ``I think the important thing is ... that there's no reason tobelieve that they are engaged in any offensive operations,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
