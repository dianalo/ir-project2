The Central Bank, the equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve,also announced the cruzado, the national currency, would bedevalued 10.7 percent effective Monday, when the banks re-open.   The three-day bank holiday was decreed by Zelia Cardoso deMello, the nation's new economic minister, who is to take officeThursday with the new president.   She said in a brief statement, ``The bank holiday was declaredto preserve the stability of markets until the whole package ofmeasures is announced. In the past few days, there has been a greatdeal of speculative activity and we wanted to calm the marketdown.''   Ms. Cardoso de Mello, no relation to the president-elect,offered no further information about the new economic proposals,which are expected to be announced when the president-electaddresses Congress Friday morning.   The move took many locals and economists by surprise becauseonly a day earlier Ms. Cardoso de Mello had said, ``A bank holidayis absolutely not necessary.''   Analysts said the bank holiday was in response to large-scalewithdrawals from the $60 billion that rolls over every day on the``overnight'' _ short-term deposits paying interest rates of up to100 percent that the government uses to finance its burdensome $31billion public deficit.   Its public deficit contributes a large portion to Brazil's $114billion foreign debt, which is the developing world's largest,followed by Mexico and Argentina. Most of its debt is to U.S. andEuropean banks.   Investors, uneasy about Collor de Mello's economic plans, haveused withdrawals from the ``overnight'' to speculate in gold andthe illegal but widely tolerated black market for dollars, causingwild swings in their values in recent weeks.   Collor de Mello, Brazil's first directly elected president inalmost 30 years, has promised free-market economic reforms to tryto bring down the debilitating inflation rate _ 2,700 percent thepast 12 months. February's inflation was 73 percent.   Collor de Mello is to replace Jose Sarney, who took office in1985 but by law could not run for re-election.   The new economic package is rumored to include privatizations ofinefficient state companies, layoffs of thousands of publicemployees and widescale spending cuts.   Business leaders have expressed concern about a possiblewage-and-price freeze, the basis of four failed anti-inflationaryplans by the Sarney administration.   Bank holidays are not common in Brazil. The last was Jan. 15,1989, when Sarney decreed his fourth austerity package, popularlyknown as the ``Summer Plan,'' which froze wages and prices on basicgoods.   Both the president-elect and Ms. Cardoso de Mello have deniedthey will implement a freeze.   By Tuesday evening, lines stretched for blocks at automatic bankmachines in major cities with people trying to get cash for thenext several days. Withdrawals were limited to $47 per person perday.   ``The population can remain calm. There will be enough money forthe entire weekend,'' said Getulio Mota, manager of a Bradesco bankbranch in Rio de Janeiro, quashing rumors of cash shortages.   Privately owned Jornal do Brasil radio in Rio reported the newadministration was planning to create a new currency but CentralBank spokesman Petro Kleinberg said he knew nothing of such a plan.   The devaluation was much larger than normal. Officials have beendevaluing the cruzado about 2 percent daily to keep up withinflation.   Brazil, with about 150 million residents, has been wracked foryears by persistently high inflation and an active labor movementthat wages debilitating strikes for higher salaries and benefits.   The unions in particular are strong.   Of Brazil's 60-million-member work force, the leftist CentralWorkers Union and the more moderate General Workers Center claim torepresent close to 35 million workers.   Waves of strikes _ from schools to hospitals _ have rocked theeconomy in recent months, including February when 60,000 Petrobrasoil workers staged an eight-day strike, paralyzing oil productionand refineries.   Brazil's per capita income in 1986, the latest figuresavailable, was about $1,740 but real wages have declined forseveral years due to raging inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
