The sugar producer didn't place a total value on the bid or disclose who are the members of Arcunum or which managers are involved. Holly couldn't be reached for comment.    Michael S. Buschbaum, Holly's chairman, has been trying with other members of Holly management, to take the company private since at least March 1982, but hasn't been able to find financing. In June, Shamrock Holdings Inc. bought a 5.5% stake in the company and said it was considering joining another group with a 10% Holly stake in a possible bid.    Holly said the proposal called for each of Holly's common shares not held by the management group to be swapped for $35 in cash and one share of a new class of preferred stock. As of Sept. 30, Holly had about 1.1 million shares outstanding.    The new preferred stock would have a redemption value of $90, would pay an annual dividend of $7.20 beginning March 31, 1988, and would also include a coupon detachable after one year. The coupons would pay a variable dividend contingent on the average market price of raw sugar and Holly's sugar margins. The total payments from the coupon couldn't exceed $67.50 and could be redeemed by Holly, the company said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Holly's stock closed at $105.875, up 37.5 cents. The announcement was made after the market closed.    Holly said its board retained Allen andamp; Co. to evaluate the proposal, any proposal from other parties and to &quot;explore available alternatives so as to maximize shareholder value.&quot; Holly said it also appointed its five outside directors to a special committee to evaluate the proposal and explore alternatives.    Holly said the board also received a letter from a major New York bank saying a syndicate of banks had approved a credit facility for paying a &quot;major&quot; part of the proposal's cash requirements. The bank financing is subject to a number of conditions, Holly said.    In a leveraged buyout, an investor group takes a company private in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the company's operations or sale of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
