Crewmen from the Chilean cutter Yelcho on Tuesday encircled thenearly sunken Argentina vessel Bahia Paraiso with floating boomsdesigned to contain any further leakage, said a navy communiquereleased in Santiago.   New Zealand Press Association today reported that thousands ofbaby Polar Skua gulls had died because their parents were unable tofind food.   The predatory birds also can freeze to death if the oil disruptstheir natural insulation or be poisoned if they swallow oil whilepreening themselves or eat contaminated prey.   The news agency, citing unidentified scientists at the nearbyU.S. Palmer Station on the Antarctic Peninsula, said the oil slickhas surrounded penguin rookeries near the wrecked ship.   An operator reached by telephone at the research station referredall inquiries to the Washington-based National Science Foundation,which oversees the base 590 miles from the tip of South America.   The Argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals Jan. 28.   The ship holds about 800 tons of fuel, including diesel oil inbulk and aviation fuel in steel drums. The National ScienceFoundation says oil is leaking slowly from the ship, which graduallysank in the shallow waters. Only a section of its superstructureremains above the surface.   Foundation officials said Tuesday that a slick nearly 500 feetwide and two miles long was trailing away from the vessel toward thesouth, threatening the frozen continent's fragile and unspoiledenvironment. Today's New Zealand report said the slick was fourmiles long. It did not mention width.   A U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, was expected to joincleanup efforts. It carries military and civilian experts and 52tons of sophisticated equipment.   A research vessel of the Chilean Antarctic Institute also was atthe spill site evaluating environmental damage, said the insitute'sdirector, Antonio Massei.   In a telephone interview in Santiago, he said the area around theaccident is home to 29,000 penguins. Scientists say many babypenguins soon will take their first swim in the waters, and they areworried the youngsters could suffocate in the oil.   Other wildlife also is threatened, including krill, a tinyshrimp-like crustacean considered a vital link in Antarctica's foodchain.   U.S. researchers say a number of seals were seen covered with oiland moving slowly in the waters.   Both the Yelcho and the Polar Duke left Friday from the Chileanport of Punta Arenas, a major supply point for Antarctic operations.   Two Argentine vessels were in the area of the spill and plannedto help, according to the Chilean navy. However, the ships wereawaiting equipment being flown from Argentina to a Chilean-run base200 miles from the wreckage.</TEXT></DOC>
