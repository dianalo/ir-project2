Yeutter's statement followed the Bonn government's decision totake over an increased share of Messerscmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB),the weapons producer which is the parent company of Duetsche Airbus,the German Airbus consortium partner.   The decision is designed to offset potential losses on Airbusmanufacturing programs which West German officials blame on the highexchange rate of the West German mark to the U.S. dollar.   ``A decision to provide additional Airbus subsidies isparticularly unacceptable, coming as it does during ongoingdiscussions between the Airbus partner governments and the UnitedStates,'' the statement said.   The lengthy negotiations within the framework of GATT, theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is designed to determinegovernment subsidy levels for civilian aircraft manufacturers.   The United States believes the French, German and Britishgovernments' support for Airbus is unfair competition to Boeing andMcDonnell Douglas, two American companies that are Airbus' biggestcompetitors.   ``It is an essential tenet of private enterprise that businessfirms absorb the risks associated with commercial ventures,including exchange rate risks,'' Yeutter said. ``Why should Airbusbe singled out for special treatment?''   Exchange rate fluctuations are part of the risks of internationalbusiness, Yeutter said, and they should not be borne ``by Germantaxpayers or workers in other industries, either in Germany or theUnited States.''   When the U.S. dollar was strong, the United States did notsubsidize American manufacturers despite their loss ofcompetitiveness, Yeutter said. ``Similarly, we expect othercountries to avoid such temptations,'' his statement said.   Yeutter said he would be meeting soon with West German officialsto review their decision ``and examine the consistency of suchsupport with the Federal Republic of Germany's internationalobligations.''</TEXT></DOC>
