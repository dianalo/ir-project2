Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidate Pat Robertson will drop his libel suit against former Rep. Pete McCloskey, a move that frees the candidate's time for campaigning but leaves his war record under a cloud.    Lawyers for Mr. Robertson said yesterday the Republican candidate will ask a federal court judge here to dismiss the lawsuit, which was scheduled for trial beginning March 8, Super Tuesday. The suit, brought a year and a half ago, contested Mr. McCloskey's assertion that Mr. Robertson had used the influence of his father, a U.S. senator, to avoid combat during the Korean War.    If the judge allows the case to be dropped, the decision is likely to leave Mr. McCloskey with a very expensive victory. Dismissal of the case &quot;with prejudice&quot; would end Mr. Robertson's right to sue Mr. McCloskey over the statement. But Mr. Robertson's lawyers said they would fight vigorously any attempt by the judge to award Mr. McCloskey anything close to the $400,000 in legal fees he says he has paid to defend himself.    In a statement, Mr. Robertson said he decided to drop the suit because he couldn't afford to lose the campaigning time. Super Tuesday is the day on which 20 states hold presidential contests, and a trial could have lasted three weeks. An earlier attempt to postpone the trial was denied. &quot;Going to trial on March 8 would mean that I would have to stop campaigning immediately and prepare for trial,&quot; the former television evangelist said in a statement.    The issue is sure to persist as part of the political debate; Mr. Robertson already is under attack for alleged misstatements. He lately has asserted that there are nuclear missiles in Cuba and that he had known the locations of some American hostages in Lebanon. Questions also have been asked about other parts of his resume, including his education. What's more, Mr. McCloskey's case was widely regarded as a strong one that would have generated a lot of negative publicity about the candidate.    Each party continues to assert that he is telling the truth. Mr. Robertson wants to take the case to arbitration, a move he had earlier rejected and which Mr. McCloskey now has refused. Mr. McCloskey wants his day in court; he is angry that the candidate might make good on a threat he says Mr. Robertson made to him privately, that &quot;this is going to cost you a lot of money.&quot; George Lehner, Mr. McCloskey's attorney, said yesterday, &quot;We are preparing to go to trial and we really haven't looked at what to do next,&quot; if the lawsuit is dismissed. </TEXT></DOC>
