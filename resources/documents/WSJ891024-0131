Conasupo Director Ignacio Ovalle Fernandez said the agency will sell 589 midsized supermarkets and several food-production plants and warehouses beginning early next year. The agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products, maintaining production of the two most important ones, corn and milk. Mr. Ovalle also said Conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of nonessential farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods.    The agency's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale.    Conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at state-subsidized prices. Business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of bureacratic waste.    Private-sector leaders praised the Conasupo restructuring. But most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into Conasupo government subsidy, which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk. </TEXT></DOC>
