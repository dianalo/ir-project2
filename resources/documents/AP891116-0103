U.S. immigration officials, however, said Wednesday they have noevidence of an impending exodus from Central America. SouthernTexas is the most common crossing point for Central Americans.   More than 500 people have died and 1,000 have been wounded in ElSalvador since leftist guerrillas launched an offensive over theweekend that has crippled the capital, San Salvador.   Jose Rafael Romero, a Salvadoran seeking asylum in Harlingen,said he knew of many more countrymen headed north.   ``I spoke with my family Saturday on the telephone and theborders were full of people leaving, trying to come here and askfor political asylum,'' he said.   Thousands displaced from the intensified fighting will head tothe United States, said Mark Schneider, a lawyer with the ProyectoLibertad legal aid office for Central Americans here.   ``The people who are in the middle at this point are going to befurther intimidated and trying to leave,'' Schneider said. ``Thewar has come out from underground. This is full-fledged war.''   Immigration attorney Linda Yanez, in the border city ofBrownsville, said Nicaraguans wary of violence and uncertaintysurrounding the national elections set for February also areleaving.   ``A lot of them have been telling me that their families arepacking up and getting ready to leave,'' Ms. Yanez said. ``There'sa lot of uncertainty. I think there's a feeling that they need toget out before the election.''   The end of a cease-fire Nov. 1 between the Nicaraguan governmentand Contra rebels also could drive people out, she said.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border Patrolsaid they had no evidence of large numbers of Central Americansheaded their way.   Duke Austin, INS spokesman in Washington, said, ``No matter whathappens in Central America, the immigrant rights advocates predictan increase in immigrants.''   ``We don't see any buildup as such into Mexico or along theMexican border,'' said David Trevino, Border Patrol supervisoryintelligence agent for the sector covering the southernmost tip ofTexas.   Earlier this year, the INS was seeing hundreds of CentralAmericans voluntarily presenting themselves each day to apply forpolitical asylum. Central Americans pouring across the bordercamped in a tent city and in abandoned buildings in the Brownsvillearea.   Then on Feb. 21, the INS began one-day adjudication of asylumrequests in southern Texas. Those denied refugee status are takenimmediately into custody for deportation.   Since then, the INS in Harlingen as of Wednesday had reviewed995 voluntary asylum applications. Of those, the INS has approved168, including 154 Nicaraguans, 11 Salvadorans, two Guatemalans andone Honduran.   Asylum is granted to those able to show they are fleeingpersecution.</TEXT></DOC>
