(products).andO;Topic:     File ServersMarket EntryMicroprocessorsTrends.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The single most important trend in information-systems use during the early1990s will be the replacement of traditional mainframe and minicomputersystems with microprocessor-based alternatives.andP;  The single most importanthardware category with the greatest growth potential during that period willbe network servers of various sorts.andM;NetFrame Systems Inc.'s recent introduction of its &quot;network mainframe&quot;product line represents a major advance for both the trend and the productcategory.andM;NetFrame's new products open the door to an important range of possibilitiesfor microprocessor-based systems.andP;  They also raise the competitive stakes forother vendors, and escalate the battle to deliver minicomputer and evenmainframe capabilities at microcomputer prices.andM;Until now, most of the more powerful microprocessor-based systems withgreater capacities and capabilities have been configured like traditionalsystems.andP;  NCR's Tower line, Prime's EXL series and more powerful systemsbased on multiple microprocessors, such as those from Stratus and Sequent,are often used in relatively traditional multiterminal, multiuserconfigurations.andM;All of these, of course, provide much lower costs per unit performance thanthe expensive, traditional minicomputer or mainframe systems that theyreplace.andP;  All of them, like more and more minicomputers, can be used asnetwork servers as well.andM;Their architectural heritage, however, is that of the traditional multiusersystems supporting multiple character-mode terminals.andP;  They are all shippedwith Unix or Unix-based operating systems.andP;  Effective as they are as networkservers, such use is architecturally secondary for them.andM;NetFrame's new systems are designed from the start as network servers.andP;  Theyare built using the same Intel microprocessors found in personal computerswith the same operating systems and application software in mind.andM;Thus, they will directly run software such as Novell's NetWare 386 (the firstoperating system available for them, modified slightly to support themultiprocessing architecture of the machine) and Microsoft's OS/2, LANManager and SQL Server (the latter due early next year).andP;  They will runstandard IBM and compatible software.andP;  Oracle Server and Informix supportwere announced with the product.andP;  Many others will follow.andM;NetFrame Chairman Carlton Amdahl and President Enzo Torresi have not onlyissued a challenge to other vendors of microprocessor-based systems.andP;  Theyhave also fired an important shot across the bow of the traditional mainframeand minicomputer vendors.andM;Like Sir Francis Drake overtaking lumbering Spanish treasure ships, theyaren't going to stop with warning shots.andP;  Products like NetFrame's willshatter the rigging and punch holes into the hulls of old-fashioned mainframeand minicomputer systems in the years ahead, sending them permanently to restin the briny deep.andM;----------William Zachmann is the president of Canopus Research in Duxbury, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
