OSHA cited the company for 202 violations in April 1988,charging that the agency found the problems to be &quot;egregious&quot;and &quot;willful.&quot; Among other things, it said that the companyfailed to adequately monitor lead and arsenic in the air,failed to use engineering controls to reduce the exposure,failed to provide proper respirators to workers, and didn'tdo proper housekeeping. OSHA had sought fines of $1.7million, which was one of the largest penalties ever proposedat the time.</LP><TEXT>   In settling the violations, the mining concern said itdidn't admit any wrongdoing. But it said the fines resolvethe 183 citations still outstanding; about 19 citations weredropped.   As part of the settlement, Asarco said it will takespecific steps to provide extra engineering and work-relatedcontrols at the smelter.   The company also agreed to participate in a four-yearjoint study with a committee of Local 72 of the UnitedSteelworkers of America to evaluate work exposure anddetermine whether additional controls are feasible. OSHAagreed to forgo issuing citations for matters related to thesettlement during that period.   Although the fines OSHA intially proposed were consideredsizable, they pale in comparison with fines recently paid aspart of a crackdown on unsafe conditions in the petrochemicaland petroleum industry. Last month, Citgo Petroleum Corp.,Tulsa, Okla., agreed to pay a $6 million fine to settlecharges related to a fatal March fire and explosion at itsrefinery. And Phillips Petroleum Co. recently agreed to pay$4 million to settle charges related to explosions thatkilled 23 people at a chemical plant outside Houston inOctober 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
