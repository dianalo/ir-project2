An official source, who refused to be further identified,confirmed a newspaper report on the disposition of Hassan Turabi,head of the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, and MohamedOsman Mirghani, head of the centrist Democratic Unionist Party.   The source would give no further details, but followers of thetwo said they were transferred from Kober Prison in suburbanKhartoum. Several politicians remain incarcerated at the prison,chief among them the ousted prime minister, Sadek el-Mahdi of theUmma Party.   The official newspaper Al-Sudan Al-Hadith said Turabi andMirghani were released ``after they voiced their support for therevolution'' and the policies of the military government, whichinclude disbanding Sudan's 36 political parties.   ``They have not been implicated in recent communist plots aimingto undermine the revolution,'' the newspaper said.   That seemed to indicate the ruling junta is implicating el-Mahdiand Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary-general of the CommunistParty, both still in prison, in a week-long strike by doctors. Thegovernment has blamed communists for the illegal strike.   In addition to the parties, coup leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassanel-Bashir disbanded all the country's professional associations andtrade unions. He jailed most senior government officials and vowedto try them on charges of political and economic corruption.   Only a handful have been put on trial. The government says about20 officials remain in detention, but informed sources put thefigure at close to 100.</TEXT></DOC>
