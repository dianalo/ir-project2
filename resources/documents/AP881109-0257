WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis returned to work as governor ofMassachusetts on Wednesday after losing his race for the presidency,saying he was not bitter but concerned that the campaign's negativetone ``set a standard that we will live to regret.''   ``I gave it my best shot,'' the Democratic nominee told a newsconference the day after he lost the election to Vice PresidentGeorge Bush.   Dukakis, whose supporters had chanted ``'92'' _ the nextpresidential year _ when his defeat became official Tuesday night,wouldn't say if he harbored hopes of mounting another try for thepresidency in four years.   He congratulated his Republican rival for a ``very decisivevictory,'' as he had in an election-night phone call to Bush.T   But Dukakis said the election had delivered no mandate to the newpresident, whose electoral vote total was 426 to the governor's 112votes.   ``I don't see a mandate _ not when the House of Representativeshas increased its Democratic membership and the Senate has increasedits Democratic membership,'' Dukakis said.   He voiced regrets and frustraion over the negative tone of hisopponent's campaign and said distortions of his record as governorhad contributed to his defeat.   ``I'm not a bitter person,'' Dukakis said.   ``Am I disappointed? Sure I am,'' he said.   ``It was a distorted campaign, it was a campaign that distortedmy record ... it may well have set a standard that we will live toregret. But I'm not personally bitter.   ``I hope it doesn't happen, but I fear that this will be a signalnow at the national level that this kind of campaigning iseffective.''   Dukakis referred to Republican ``media manipulators'' behindBush's campaign. But he took no issue with Bush's announcement thathis campaign chairman, James Baker III, would be his secretary ofstate.   ``I believe in the redemption of souls,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis, who has two years remaining in his third term asgovernor, arose the morning after his election as usual, and was inhis office at the Massachusetts Statehouse before 9:30 a.m.   His Secret Service bodyguards, who have accompanied him since heaccepted protection in early May, were leaving him at the end of theday. He could have kept them for another week to 10 days but chosenot to.   The ever-serious governor drew chuckles from his news conferenceaudience when he said he and his wife, Kitty, would ``probably takethe weekend off.''   He said he may take a vacation in a few weeks. With that alreadyin mind, his wife presented him with a book on Hawaii shortly beforethe election.   At his campaign's national headquarters in Boston, only a few,teary-eyed workers had bothered to come by Wednesday afternoon. Sometelevision sets and furniture already were being removed, and somestaffers were making deals to buy the personal computers they hadused during the campaign.   Dukakis avoided any detailed analysis of the reasons behind hisloss, but he refused to accept a reporter's suggestion that theDemocrats had been destined to lose because the public satisfactionwith their general prosperity under a Republican president.   ``I think clearly, had things gone differently ... it waswinnable,'' Dukakis said.   He acknowledged that Democratic presidential candidates must dobetter in attracting support in the South and West, which havebecome Republican bastions even though they elect Democrats at thestate level.</TEXT></DOC>
