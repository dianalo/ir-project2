Upjohn said it submitted for U.S. Food and Drug Administration evaluation clinical studies it conducted on the use of Rogaine by women with androgenetic alopecia. The company estimated that 20 million women in the U.S. are affected by the condition. Upjohn currently has FDA approval to market the prescription drug to an estimated 30 million men with pattern baldness.    An Upjohn spokeswoman said the company planned to market Rogaine to women all along. However, FDA approval for using the drug on men came first because Upjohn didn't test the product on enough women initially. Upjohn said it began testing Rogaine on women in 1987, about four years after tests on balding men began.    Although Upjohn banked on strong Rogaine sales, and spent heavily to advertise the product, results have been below expectations. Analysts predicted annual sales could reach $200 million this year, but shortly after the advertising campaigns began earlier this year, sales hit only $4 million a month. </TEXT></DOC>
