A small credit-tightening move this month would damp inflation fear without hurting the economy, analysts say. Also, a small move now might save the Fed from having to take more drastic action later this year when the presidential campaign heats up.    Further signs of continued economic strength and mounting inflation pressure emerged from a corporate purchasing managers' survey released today by the National Association of Purchasing Management. Additional evidence is expected Friday when the Labor Department releases its April report on the nation's employment picture. Fed officials usually pay more attention to the employment figures than any other single government report in setting credit policy.    &quot;There is a very strong possibility the Fed will tighten another notch&quot; if the employment report turns out to be as strong as widely expected, said William H. Gross, a managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif. &quot;All indications are it (the employment report) will be a strong number.&quot; He said that yields on long-term Treasury bonds, now about 9 1/8%, &quot;probably are headed to 9 1/4% to 9 1/2% within the next week and a half.&quot;    The Fed's credit policy committee is scheduled to hold its next regular meeting May 17. But if the employment figures show additional economic strength, Fed officials might tighten credit before that meeting, analysts say. Some argue that inflation and interest rates will continue climbing regardless of what the Fed does.    &quot;I think rates are going to increase through the end of the year,&quot; says George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based company that manages about $23 billion. For example, he predicts the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds will increase to between 9 1/2% and 9 3/4% by year end.    Banks are likely to increase their prime lending rate soon at least a quarter of a percentage point to 8 3/4%, several analysts say. Bankers say an increase is justified because of increases in their own borrowing costs as well as stronger business loan demand recently. One regional bank, Riggs National Bank in Washington, raised its prime, or base lending, rate to 8 3/4% Friday from 8 1/2%.    Some investment strategists argue that the economy will continue expanding moderately without generating significantly higher inflation. But the new purchasing agents report, based on a survey of more than 250 industrial purchasing managers, contains ominous news on inflation.    Prices increased at a &quot;sharply faster&quot; rate last month than in March, the survey showed. The results were both surprising and &quot;disappointing,&quot; says Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.    &quot;I'd expected to see a continued decline -- or at worst a plateauing -- in the rate of price increase growth&quot; during April, Mr. Bretz says. Instead, inflation pressures &quot;apparently are starting to rise again.&quot;    &quot;I expect the Fed to tighten policy&quot; soon, says Charles Lieberman, a managing director of Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. He contends that the Fed might even act as soon as Friday if the employment report is as strong as is widely expected.    &quot;The Fed is very concerned that strong growth will lead to faster inflation, and they have to act in anticipation of rising prices because it's harder to fight inflation once it builds momentum,&quot; Mr. Lieberman says.    The Fed probably will drive up the federal funds rate to the 7%-to-7 1/4% range, according to Mr. Lieberman. The rate on funds, or overnight loans between banks, recently has averaged between about 6 3/4% and 6 7/8%.    While Fed officials won't divulge their credit policy plans, several recently have dropped strong hints by emphasizing growing concern about the inflation outlook. Their comments, taken together with the likely pattern of economic reports coming soon, &quot;suggest strongly that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will firm money market conditions&quot; at its May 17 meeting, according to Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.    The most important statistic in the employment report Friday will be the number of workers on nonfarm payrolls, observers of the Fed agree. Many analysts expect a solid increase of about 250,000, compared with 262,000 in March. Some, though, predict the increase will be more than 300,000, a development they say would clinch the case for another credit-tightening move.    The economy &quot;looks pretty strong,&quot; says Norman Robertson, a senior vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. He agrees that the Fed will tighten its credit clamp soon. &quot;A slight rise in interest rates now isn't going to bring this expansion to an end, but it might just reduce inflationary expectations,&quot; he says.    &quot;In a presidential election year, the Fed would prefer to tighten before the campaign begins, rather than tighten during the heat of the campaign itself,&quot; Mr. Robertson adds.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, Treasury officials are scheduled to disclose Wednesday the size of the government's quarterly financing operation. The three-part financing package is expected to total between $26 billion and $27 billion of notes and bonds to be sold May 10, 11 and 12.    Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson Lufkin estimates a total of $26.25 billion. She expects it to consist of $9 billion of three-year notes, $8.75 billion of 10-year notes and $8.5 billion of 30-year bonds.    The government's total financing needs this quarter are likely to be the smallest in &quot;at least seven years,&quot; according to Susan Hering of Salomon Brothers Inc. She says this will reflect &quot;a seasonal pickup in receipts&quot; during this quarter as well as an expected narrowing in the government's budget deficit.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Most interest rates drifted slightly higher, continuing their climb of the past two months.    The Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted late in the day at a price of 97 20/32 to yield 9.11%. That compared with Thursday's close of 97 22/32 to yield 9.10%. On Feb. 10, this issue stood at 106 10/32 to yield 8.30%. But it still is well below the nearly 10 1/2% level it hit last Oct. 19 when the stock market collapsed.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. declined 0.71 point to 1236.55, matching its lowest closing level of the year, set Jan. 12. The index Friday ranged between 1234.81 and 1241.69.    The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 edged lower to 95 2/32 from 95 5/32. The yield climbed to 8.89% from 8.87%.    Among short-term rates, three-month Treasury bills were quoted at 6% bid, up from 5.98% Thursday. Six-month bills were quoted at 6.37% bid, up from 6.35%. </TEXT></DOC>
