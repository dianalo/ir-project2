One comment was received.The comment praised the change allowing valuation of land purchased morethan 2 years prior to the relevant application to be based on appraisedmarket value. On the proposed regulations published for comment on October 21, 1988,3 comments were received. All three comments opposed limiting the borrower'scontribution to the 503 company's injection. All three commenters opposedthe provision prohibiting the value of the borrower's contribution to exceedeither the amount of the 503 debenture or the value of the private (third-party)contribution to the project. The commenters point out that there are avariety of instances where it may be to the program's advantage to havethe borrower's contribution exceed that of the other parties. These instancesinclude single use facilities or situations where the collateral is inadequateand a greater borrower's equity would enhance the creditworthiness of theproject. There are also instances where a larger project of significanteconomic importance to the community requires SBA assistance but the limitationson SBA's commitment to $750,000 prevents the SBA from supporting its fullshare of the total project. If the private sector lender could not or wouldnot provide the balance, the borrower's additional contribution would makepossible a beneficial project. Accordingly, the provision proposing toso limit the borrowers contribution has been deleted. The second prohibition limited the borrower's contribution to cash or land,valued pursuant to andSection; 108.503-5(d)(2). One of the commenters objectedto limiting it to the value of the land only, without improvements. Afterconsidering the comment, SBA adopted the comment in the final rule whichallows for the borrower's contribution of land and site improvements (e.g.,utilities). In summary, the final rule allows real property to be contributedas all or part of the CDC injection, but the borrower contribution is limitedto land and site improvements, without buildings. Section 108.503-1(b)(2) is adopted as proposed. The provision makes clearthat the board of directors of a 503 company may vote on a proposed loanapproval or servicing action even if no person with commercial lendingexperience is present at the meeting, if such a person has made a documentedrecommendation concerning such proposed action. Lastly, final rule andSection; 108.503-15(e)(1), adopted as proposed, authorizesSBA to transfer an existing or a pending 503 financing from a developmentcompany which is under temporary or other sanction, to a 503 company ingood standing. <ITAG tagnum="85">Compliance With Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct and the Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>For purposes of Executive Order 12291, SBA has determined that this rule,taken as a whole, does not constitute a major rule for the purposes ofExecutive Order 12291, because the annual effect of this rule on the nationaleconomy does not attain $100 million. In this regard, we estimate thatthe rule permitting increased leasing of newly acquired space will affectabout 3% of the total annual loan volume, or $9 million. The rule permittingland held over two years to be valued by appraisal will affect at the most$12 million (4%) and the rule prohibiting the contribution of buildingsby the small concern to its own project will affect no more than $5 million.The other rules, concerning the vote by the board of directors of a developmentcompany on loan and servicing actions, and the rule permitting the transferof projects from development companies facing sanction, to developmentcompanies in good standing, have no or only negligible impact on the economy.Accordingly, we estimate the aggregate impact of these rules on the nationaleconomy not to exceed $26 million. Also, these rules do not result in amajor increase in costs or price to consumers, individual industries, Federal,state and local government agencies or geographic regions, and will nothave significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity or innovation.For purposes of compliance with Executive Order 12612, SBA certifies thatthese rules do not warrant the preparation of a Federal Assessment. For the purpose of compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601 et seq., the provisions of this rule will have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The following analysisof the provisions is provided within the context of the review prescribedin the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603). 1. <T3>Need for and objective of the rule. </T3>The first rule, promulgatedwithout change from its interim final form, brings andSection; 108.8(d) intoline with another rule (andSection; 108.503-4(a)). Both rules now permita small concern to lease out to others up to one-third of space newly acquiredwith the help of 503 assistance. The second rule permits land contributedto a 503 project by the small concern to be valued by appraisal if theland was acquired more than 2 years before the initial application to SBA.For a fuller explanation of these two rules, see 53 FR 10242 (March 30,1988). The third proposed rule here promulgated, andSection; 108.503-1(b)(2)would not have permitted an absentee ballot by the person whose vote isrequired for a loan approval or servicing action to control board action,a result which SBA did not intend. Under the new wording, the board canproceed, whether the absentee vote is positive or negative. The reasons for the fourth rule, andSection; 108.503-10, are (1) that itwas never SBA's intention to permit the 503 borrower to inject propertyother than cash into a project. The valuation of personal property andof buildings creates difficulties. Accordingly, the word ``property'' isqualified by the word ``real'' and such real property is subjected to thevaluation rule, andSection; 108.503-5(d), which applies to land. (2) Thecontribution by the small concern may include, or consist of, land withsite improvements, valued pursuant to andSection; 108.503-5(d). SBA limitsthe small concern's contribution, besides cash, to land only because thevaluation of existing buildings owned by the borrower would give rise tocontroversy. The purpose of the fifth rule is to permit the shift of an economic developmentproject from a development company facing sanction, to another in goodstanding, in order to insulate a small business applicant from the consequencesof such sanction (<T3>e.g., </T3>SBA's refusal to guarantee the resulting debenture). 2. <T3>Summary and SBA assessment of public comments. </T3>The 3 criticalcomments, all concerned with a proposed limitation on the size of the smallconcern's contribution to its own project, have been discussed above. 3. <T3>Alternatives to the rule. </T3>The only alternative to the rule herepromulgated is to leave these regulations unchanged, an option which conflictswith SBA's administrative experience. The legal basis of these proposed rule changes is Section 503(a)(2) ofthe Small Business Investment Act, 15 U.S.C. 697(a)(2). These regulations contain no reporting or record keeping requirements whichhave not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under thePaperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Ch. 35). There are no new reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirementsinherent in these rules. There are no Federal rules which duplicate, overlapor conflict with these rules. There are no significant alternate meansto accomplish the objectives of these rules. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 108 </ITAG>Loan programs/business, Small businesses.For the reasons set out above, 13 CFR Part 108 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 108_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
