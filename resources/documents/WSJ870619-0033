SCI, a communications concern that is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment firm, had said previously that it was negotiating the sale of a 51% stake in the stations to closely held Gillett, Nashville, Tenn., which has interests of broadcasting, publishing and real estate.    Under the agreement announced yesterday, Kohlberg Kravis, through SCI, and Gillett would each pay about $650 million for about a half-interest in the new venture.    SCI is the parent of Storer Communications Inc., which was taken private by Kohlberg Kravis in a leveraged buyout in 1985. An SCI spokesman declined to comment on how proceeds of the sale will be used. But he noted that the company is currently under obligation to repay certain debt if it sells assets. SCI has about $2 billion of debt.    The transaction requires approval by the Federal Communications Commission and is subject to securing of adequate financing, SCI said. </TEXT></DOC>
