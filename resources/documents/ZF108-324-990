 The tenth annual industry gathering started the new decade withdiscussions of a range of topics that reflected both how much the industryhas changed over the past decade and how much more it is likely to change inthe coming decade.andM;When we started the Seminars nine years ago, we did so because we believedthat the industry was entering a period of profound change.andP;  This certainlyproved to be the case.andP;  In the early years, strategies for pagination, batchvs.andP;  interactive systems, WYSIWYG screen displays, the potential of laserxerographic output, and (later) font technologies and page descriptionlanguages were the roots of exciting discussions.andM;Things are different now.andP;  The intermingling of publishing technology andmainstream computer technology is so complete that most of the excitingtechnological issues are driven by companies and forces beyond thetraditional bounds of the publishing industry: fonts, PDLs,device-independent color space, data compression for color images, datastandards for information interchange, networking, file management and jobtracking facilities, hardcopy color imaging technologies, capabilities ofcomputer platforms and operating environments, and so forth.andP;  All of theseare just as important as were the earlier round of technology issues, butthey are no longer solely publishing-specific.andM;Beyond this, a lot of new technologies originating in other industries willhave a big impact on print publishers: multimedia computing, multimedia hometelevision sets, video capture, HDTV, ISDN networks, FDDI local areanetworks, etc.andM;Color is one area where technology developments are still vital.andP;  But in mostother application areas, the publishing-specific discussions have movedbeyond technology.andP;  Some people are rethinking organizational structures andresponsibilities in the light of the potential of new technologies.andP;  Almosteveryone is concerned with what we might broadly classify as systemintegration issues.andP;  No one in the long document session, for example, talkedmuch about the mechanics of page makeup.andP;  Everyone was concerned withtreating publishing as part of a larger group-wide, company-wide orindustry-wide activity.andM;The move to Boston.andP;  This was the first year a large-scale Seybold event hasbeen held on the east coast.andP;  With several major Seybold events in the U.S.andO;each year, it no longer was logical to hold all of them in California.andO;Despite the fact that March is not the ideal time to visit Boston, it waslogical to leave the fall Computer Publishing Conference (which is moreclosely tied to the desktop computer industry) in Silicon Valley and move theMarch Seybold Seminars to New England, the home of much of the technology forprofessional publishing applications.andP;  Because of the Boston weather, weselected a venue in which everything could be conducted under glass.andM;Part of the reason for moving to Boston was to strengthen the distinctionbetween the March event and the Computer Publishing Conference held inSilicon Valley each fall.andP;  It worked.andP;  Although we are talking about a shiftof no more than 100 people (out of a total of 1,260--the largest MarchSeminars ever), there was clearly more of a &quot;high-end&quot; flavor to the mix ofattendees than there had been the past two years in San Francisco.andM;The other change has been the growing importance of the new product showcase.andO;This year 82 companies brought new or prototype products, with many of thembringing more than one new thing.andP;  The showcase featured record numbers ofproduct introductions, press representatives and exhibition guests.andP;  Whatstarted almost casually eight years ago when Auto-trol asked if it could setup a system to show to Seminars attendees has evolved into an importantindustry event in its own right.andM;ThemesandM;Fonts and font technology.andP;  The &quot;hot war&quot; phase of the font wars came to anend at this year's Seminars.andP;  With IBM's help, Adobe emerged as the currentde facto standard, with Apple/Microsoft Royal cast in the role of thepromising challenger, and Compugraphic Intellifont and the Sun/Foliotechnology mounting attacks from the wings.andM;Even more important, the entire tenor of the confrontation has changed.andP;  Theantagonism of last September has been replaced with accommodation and concernfor user needs.andP;  It is clear that user reaction and user feedback has playeda decisive role in shaping the events over the past six months.andM;In any event, the Computer Publishing Conference in September now seems likea long time ago.andP;  Virtually every player of consequence in the font/fonttechnology arena had important announcements or demonstrations at theSeminars.andM;Beyond fonts.andP;  Although healthy (and reasonably cooperative) competition hasreplaced open warfare in font technology, this does not mean that all of thebattles are over, or that all of the issues have been settled.andP;  As we willdiscuss in a moment, formatted documents usually contain more than just text.andO;It looks as if the focus will soon shift to data standards for graphics, pagegeometry and other essential elements.andM;Page description languages.andP;  Last year it looked as if the companies thatcontrol desktop computing environments (Microsoft and Apple) were movingtoward using their own screen imaging languages for printer output as well.andO;Fortunately, they both changed their minds and threw their support behindPostScript.andP;  However, there is still the danger that Microsoft PostScriptwill diverge from Adobe PostScript, creating two standards rather than one.andM;In the meantime, with the debut of the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series IIIprinter just before the Seminars, HP's PCL Level 5 command language and theassociated Compugraphic Intellifont font technology have finally emerged ascontenders with impressive statute in the market.andM;Color.andP;  It is now clear that color reproduction is going to be an area ofgreat concern for large segments of the industry for at least the first halfof the coming decade.andP;  Just as in the early days of the Seybold Seminars,when we were wrestling with pagination technology, the discussions we aregetting into now intertwine technology and human and organizational issues.andO;How do we build the considerable craft skills required for color reproductioninto easy-to-use computer systems?andP;  Who will ultimately be responsible forwhich tasks?andP;  What kinds of training, experience, skills and mental qualitieswill people need to work with the new generation of color systems?andM;Although there is still a long way to go, and still a lot of confusion, weended the Seminars with a strong impression that the industry is on the vergeof huge changes in everything having to do with color.andP;  A lot happened in thecolor arena this year: rapid progress toward an international standard foron-the-fly compression and decompression of color images, a decision by keyvendors to move towards adopting a common device-independent means ofspecifying color values, important new products and important new vendorsentering the color market, and much more.andM;Document portability.andP;  Progress on color compression and color portability ispart of a strong push toward standards that will make it possible to moverich, graphic information between different types of hardware and software.andM;As long as publishing systems were closed proprietary systems supplied by asingle vendor, there was little need, in most situations, to care aboutmoving images or documents from one system to another.andP;  But things havechanged dramatically over the past few years.andP;  The reality for an increasingnumber of users is a heterogeneous production environment that includeshardware and software from several different suppliers.andP;  Beyond this, thereis an increasing realization that the basic mode of working from now on willcenter on electronic transfer of information between organizations as well aswithin organizations.andP;  It is difficult enough to enforce system uniformitywithin one organization.andP;  It is entirely unrealistic to assume it between twodifferent organizations.andM;Heterogeneous systems require standards for information interchange.andP;  This iswhy a common page description language and a common font library across alldevices are so important.andP;  But the Seminars discussions made it clear that wealso need standards for graphics--including, as noted above, a device- andsystem-independent means of specifying color so that we can move color imagesfrom one device to another.andP;  The dream for many attendees is a full,device-independent language for editable documents--something that wouldenable transfer of fully formatted pages in a fashion that allows them to beedited.andM;Electronic distribution.andP;  Fewer and fewer of the Seminars attendees arewedded solely to distribution of published documents on paper.andP;  For many,printed paper documents will remain the most effective (and cost-effective)means of distribution for many years.andP;  But increasing numbers of attendeesare interested in disseminating information electronically.andP;  Some are turningto electronic distribution because it is less expensive and more compact thanpaper.andP;  Others are intrigued with applications in which interactiveelectronic tools can communicate in a way that is not possible with printedpaper products.andM;Who will supply the solutions?andP;  We have been trying to get the industry tofocus on this issue ever since the first signs of the Fourth Wave began toappear.andP;  As people have struggled to come to grips with the rapidly changingmarket, it has become a topic that has attracted lively interest--anddeepening concern--in these seminars.andP;  This year's discussions provided someimportant insights and observations on this subject.andP;  Most of them were notencouraging.andM;Taking a system view.andP;  On the other hand, we found it immensely encouragingthat more and more users are taking a broad systems view of publishing.andP;  Thisappears to be true across the board, from the smallest magazine to thelargest in-plant tech-doc application.andM;Organization of the coverage.andP;  As is our custom, we are including most of ourcoverage of the March Seminars in the Publishing Systems report.andP;  In thisissue, we will cover the font and PDL discussions and color--along with mostof the new products.andP;  In our next issue, two weeks from now, we will pick upwith the discussions of the state of the industry, as well as &quot;publishingwithout paper&quot; and the application-specific discussions for newspapers,magazines and documentation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
