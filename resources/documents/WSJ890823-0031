The EPA warned that it may impose much stiffer penalties than in the past for such violations, and it said it has begun using its discretionary authority to bar companies found guilty of civil asbestos-removal violations from getting federal contracts, loans or grants.    Henry Habicht, EPA deputy administrator, said the agency &quot;intends to enforce these rules vigorously.&quot; The agency estimates that as much as half of the asbestos removal being done nationwide doesn't conform to regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act.    Under its new asbestos policy, the EPA will assess a minimum penalty for each violation of each subsection of its work-practice standard. Previously, the agency levied a single charge regardless of the number of sections violated.    In addition, the EPA said it will advise Justice Department and EPA attorneys to seek more than they have in the past in out-of-court settlements of asbestos-removal cases. The government's settlement demands will assume that violators improperly saved $20 a square foot in building renovation or demolition projects by failing to comply with the rules. Previously, it was assumed they saved only $4 a square foot. The new settlement guidelines are designed to eliminate any economic benefits of violating the law.    The agency's asbestos rules, which have been in effect since 1975, require that authorities be notified of asbestos-removal projects and that specific steps be taken to keep the substance out of the air. Asbestos is known to cause cancer of the lung, chest and abdominal linings and scarring of the lung.    The agency said that asbestos fibers can become airborne for considerable periods of time if they aren't wetted down or packaged correctly. When they settle, even routine movements can cause them to become airborne again, the agency said.    The crackdown on asbestos-removal violations follows the agency's announcement last month of a ban on almost all remaining uses of asbestos by 1997, a move that will force changes in products ranging from construction materials to automobile brake linings.    The Asbestos Information Association, an industry group, yesterday asked a federal court in Richmond, Va., to review the proposed ban. It argued that the ban will hurt the economy and that there isn't any evidence that the substitutes for asbestos are any less harmful.    Yesterday's suits, which were filed by the Justice Department, accused schools, restaurants and apartment buildings in 11 cities of violating the asbestos rules. The defendants could face penalties as high as $25,000 per violation per day, the EPA said.    The EPA yesterday also announced its first use of its discretionary authority to bar civil violators from federal contracts. It said that Big Apple Wrecking Co., Bronx, N.Y., and J.Y. Arnold Co., Central City, Ky., would be barred as a result of previous violations of asbestos-removal rules. </TEXT></DOC>
