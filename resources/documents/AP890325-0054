The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms had already approved the weapons shipments, but quicklyrescinded that approval Friday, the Los Angeles Times reported.   The order follows the Bush administration's announcement earlierthis month that it was issuing a temporary ban on new permitsallowing the importation of five types of assault weapons into theUnited States.   Among those banned was the AK-47, the weapon used earlier thisyear in a massacre of schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.   William T. Drake, a top official at ATF, acknowledged in aninterview with the Times that the move to ban previously approvedweapons shipments would be controversial. But he said an internalaudit detailing the vast extent of imports already authorized hadpersuaded the agency to take the emergency action.   When the moratorium on new permits was announced earlier thismonth federal officials indicated they had no control over permitsalready approved.   However, Drake said his agency believes it was granted thatpower under the 1968 Gun Control Act, which empowered the AFT togrant licenses authorizing gun imports.   ``What God giveth, God can taketh away,'' he said.   The bureau declined to disclose how many weapons have beenapproved for import, but an unidentified customs source told theTimes the number was 420,000.   According to the ATF, 70,000 assault rifles have been importedinto the U.S. in the last three years.</TEXT></DOC>
