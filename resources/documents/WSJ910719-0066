His remarks were first reported in yesterday'sChicago Tribune.</LP><TEXT>   The Senate Intelligence Committee postponed Mr. Gates'snomination hearings until September so it could obtaintestimony from Mr. Gates's former CIA colleagues. Mr. Gateshas repeatedly denied knowing that proceeds from U.S. armssales to Iran were being diverted to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   To be certain that Mr. Gates has been truthful, senatorswant the testimony of Mr. Gruner and others. They includeClair George, the CIA's former deputy director of operations,and Alan Fiers, who oversaw the agency's Central Americanoperations and worked under Mr. Gruner. Mr. Gruner, nowserving overseas, was chief of the Latin American divisionwhen the Iran-Contra scandal blew open in the fall of 1986.   Last week, Mr. Fiers pleaded guilty to misdemeanor chargesthat he had withheld information from Congress. He hasasserted that he told Mr. Gruner about the Contra diversionsin the summer of 1986 and that Mr. Gruner instructed him toreport the information to Mr. George. But Mr. Hundley saidMr. Fiers was wrong.</TEXT></DOC>
