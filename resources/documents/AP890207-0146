The ``no-exceptions'' policy requires allied rejection of allSoviet requests for the purchase of items with potential militaryuse.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said U.S. allies in the15-nation Coordinating Committee for Strategic Exports (COCOM)believe that the policy should now be lifted.   Redman said that with the Soviets' Afghan withdrawal in its finalstage, the administration has begun a review of this policy. Underan agreement signed last spring, the Soviets pledged to have all ofits troops out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15.   Redman said the administration continues to oppose the export ofgoods or technology in COCOM that would pose a strategic risk.   ``Whatever might come out of this review and whatever might bedecided in COCOM, lifting the `no exceptions' policy would in no wayweaken the COCOM regime or facilitate the flow of sensitivetechnology to the Soviet Union,'' he said.   Even if the policy is lifted, all exports of dual-usetechnologies would still be subject to COCOM review, and the UnitedStates would still block the sale of any militarily sensitivetechnologies to the Soviet Union, he said.   COCOM membership includes Japan and all NATO allies exceptIceland.</TEXT></DOC>
