New York City, for instance.   ``It was a marvelous city in the '50s, '60s, '70s,'' said the65-year-old filmmaker, a native New Yorker who has earned AcademyAward nominations for such New York-based films as ``Dog DayAfternoon'' and ``Network.''   ``I think it's dreadful now; I'm surprised. The fish has gonebelly up. That ethnic camaraderie has gone. It's separatewolfpacks.''   And New York cops.   ``I've always been proud of the New York police force. Theuniforms don't fit, and their hair's too long and they've got a bitof a belly. Still, they've never lost a hostage in a hostagesituation. They've done some great things.   ``But now, there's been 12, 14 shootings of blacks in the pastfew years. It's never happened before in this city.''   That ambivalence has been channeled into his films, into suchcharacters as Treat Williams' disenchanted cop in ``Prince of theCity,'' and Paul Newman's shady lawyer in ``The Verdict.''   Lumet didn't know how he felt about either character when hebegan filming, forming his opinions simply by calling ``print'' atthe completion of a scene. And for his new film, ``Qandamp;A,'' he hadthe same mixed feelings about the characters played by stars NickNolte, Timothy Hutton and Armand Assante.   ``Qandamp;A'' is based on a novel by Edwin Torres, a justice of theNew York State Supreme Court. Nolte stars as Mike Brennan, acorrupt Irish cop who shoots a Puerto Rican thug and attempts tocover up the crime.   Hutton is Al Reilly, a naive assistant prosecutor assigned toNolte's case, and Assante plays Bobby Texador, another Puerto Ricanunderworld figure murdered by Nolte.   ``I said at the beginning of rehearsal that if I do this moviewell you're going to feel a kind of sadness when Armand gets blownup,'' Lumet recalled. ``There's something noble about him.   ``With Nick's character, he's going on and on and on, and youthink he's the most hateful thing that's ever been. Then, the thingat the end, when he talks about being a cop, about `our widows,'and `our orphans.' There's all of those facets.''   In ``Qandamp;A,'' Lumet offers a bleak vision of New York, depicting acity that has heard Peter Finch's tormented call to arms in``Network'' _ ``I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take itanymore'' _ and adopted it as a way of life.   Lumet presents a fallen rainbow coalition, with racism expressedin the harshest language or the slightest twitch of the face.   ``There used to be a celebration of difference,'' Lumet said,``and that feeling has completely gone. It's profound, and it's notjust New York. I think it's happening all around. One of thereasons I wanted to make this film is that I sensed this `old boy'network was all bull.''   Lumet's mixed feelings even extend to location shooting. Itbegan in the late 1950s as a necessity, when lack of studio spaceforced him outside. Proudly, the director recalled his years oflocation work, in ``Dog Day Afternoon,'' ``Serpico'' and the 1965film ``The Pawnbroker,'' shot entirely in Harlem.   But while Lumet and crew covered everything from GreenwichVillage to Kennedy Airport for ``Qandamp;A,'' the director admitted thatafter years of hitting the streets and never looking back, he nowcatches himself peering nervously over his shoulder.   ``Tim and Nick went out riding in squad cars, riding inWashington Heights, one of the last integrated neighborhoods in NewYork. Nick said to me, `How come you don't go.'   ``I said I can't do that anymore. I can't stand those domesticdisputes. A cop getting shot or a cop shooting someone. Living likethat, I don't know how the cops do it. It's a very ambivalentfeeling.''   For Lumet, the blurring of right and wrong has been a mixedblessing: a feeling of loss over people and places he once revered,but also a challenge to become more open-minded. The director sayshe values forgiveness, in life and film, and always looks for threedimensions: even with people that exist only on screen.   ``I think a big part of my own life, and my own concerns havehad a lot to do with judging and not judging people. Rigid behaviorversus behavior that flows with life.   ``I think it's very Jewish. I'm not a religious person at alland I had to go to a Seder for Passover. I was reminded how sternJudaism is. How unforgiving, how tough. You can't get off the hook.You can't get confession. You can't do nothing. Once you've blownit, you've blown it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, May 8</NOTE></DOC>
