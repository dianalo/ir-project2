Profit in the quarter amounted to 70 cents a share. Butexcluding the gain from the sale of Unocal's Norwegian oiland gas subsidiary and other extraordinary items, operatingearnings totaled just 15 cents a share -- five cents belowwhat many analysts had projected. By comparison, Unocalearned about 38 cents a share from operations in the quartera year earlier, analysts said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The number is disappointing,&quot; said Frederick P. LeufferJr. of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York, whois cutting his full-year earnings estimate on Unocal to $1 ashare from $1.05. &quot;Exploration expenses were higher thananticipated, and they had some refinery turnarounds anddowntime from maintenance . . . {but} I think these areone-time events that will be corrected.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Unocal shares closed at $30.125 a share, off 25 cents.   Unocal said the drop in operating results reflected lowerdomestic crude-oil production, higher domestic oil and gasproduction expenses and lower earnings from chemicaloperations. These were offset by the $132 million gain,higher domestic natural-gas prices and production, and lowerdeferred income taxes and net interest expense. Earnings forthe quarter included $12 million of deferred income-taxbenefits.   Second-quarter earnings the previous year were $120million, or 51 cents a share, after $27 million in after-taxgains from property sales and an $11 million gain from thesettlement of certain pension obligations.   Revenue for the second quarter fell 11% to $2.72 billionfrom $3.07 billion. Unocal said the drop reflected theabsence of petroleum product sales attributable to itsMidwest Marketing Division, which is now part of UNO-VEN Co.,a 50-50 joint venture that Unocal formed with Petroleos deVenezuela S.A. last December.   Domestic crude-oil and condensate production fell in thequarter to 132,200 barrels a day from 154,000 barrels a yearago. Unocal blamed the drop on a temporary suspension of oilproduction in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska because oferuptions of Mount Redoubt, and on the company's sale of its14% stake in a Long Beach, Calif., production joint venture.Unocal's world-wide production in the quarter fell to 225,500barrels a day from 242,400 barrels a day the previous year.Natural-gas production rose to an average 1.33 billion cubicfeet a day from 1.27 billion cubic feet the previous year.   Second-quarter earnings from exploration and productionoperations, including the $132 million gain, totaled $205million, compared with $101 million a year ago. Earnings fromrefining, marketing and transportation operations rose to $30million in the quarter from $28 million a year ago. Earningsfrom chemicals operations fell to $16 million from $21million, and earnings from geothermal operations fell to $8million from $11 million.   For the first six months, Unocal's earnings rose 17% to$242 million, or $1.03 a share, from $207 million, or 88cents a share, a year ago. Sales fell 6% to $5.36 billionfrom $5.7 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
