Department spokesmen said investigators determined there wasn't sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution in the nearly three-year criminal probe. The investigation followed reports in the Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal alleging that owners of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the city's surviving daily newspaper, agreed to pay $14.5 million to the Press owners &quot;in part to close the Press.&quot;    In Cleveland, the Plain Dealer declined comment.    Senior Justice Department antitrust officials denied a request by the agency's Cleveland office to open a civil investigation shortly after the Press closed. Later, when allegations of antitrust violations surfaced, a grand jury in Cleveland began hearing testimony related to the closing. Department officials declined to comment on specific evidence presented to the grand jury, or whether an indictment was sought.    In a March 1985 ruling in a related civil suit filed by 89 former Press employees, a federal district judge said that &quot;a jury could find, as a matter of fact,&quot; that the Plain Dealer and the Newhouse family that controlled it &quot;wanted to assure that the Press went out of business and that (the) Plain Dealer acquired a newspaper monopoly in Cleveland.&quot; The judge dismissed lawsuits against the Plain Dealer and the Press by the former Press employees.    In the past, attorneys for the Newhouse family have said that the Plain Dealer's agreement to purchase the Press subscription list along with a free weekly newspaper was made after Press owners decided to close the daily paper. </TEXT></DOC>
