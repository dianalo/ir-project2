 shows such as GraphExpo, it provides almost as much exhibition space and it attracts most of thekey vendors.andP;  Its total of about 400,000 square feet of exhibit space nearlyequaled the 425,000 or so at this year's Graph Expe.andM;Because Graphic Trade came so soon after Graph Expo, it did't produce as manynew developemnts as it migh have otherwise, but there was enough news to keepus busy there for three days.andP;  Among the highlights was the arrival back inNorth America of Scangraphic, although not with its own staff and office.andP;  IThas signed a distribution agreement with Photographix, based in Toronto,which will cover Canada initially.andM;Also notable was a new operation set up by Pierre Gravel to handle Bertholdsystems and some other products in North America.andP;  We expect to see Pierreactive south of the Canadian border as well as in his familiar stompinggrounds.andM;New to this show was an area set aside as the &quot;desktop center.&quot;andP;  Although itcovered much borader markets than desktop publishing--Xyvision, Monotype andMiles 33 were present--it did attract companies such as Quark and XeroxDesktop Software.andM;We'll have details on those developments and other highlights from the showin the following report.andP;  We won't cover the vendors that had nothingnew--such as Interleaf, Linotype, Monotype, Miles 33, Hell, AgfaCompugraphic, Xyvision and a host of other household names in the graphicarts industry.andM;Scangraphic returns to North AmericaandM;Photographix, which has been distributing Itek and Printware systems for along time, has added Scangraphic to the list of products it sells.andP;  It hasobtained distribution rights in Canada and is involved in discussions aboutexpanding to the U.S.andP;  also, probably on a nonexclusive basis.andP;  We don't knowhow the talks will evolve, but we expect that how the Scangraphic lines faresin Canada may have an impact on a decision regarding U.S.andP;  sales.andM;Photographix, which will handle the entire Scangraphic product line, isoptimistic about the Canadian market.andP;  It claims that the graphic artsindustry is the second largest employer in the province of Ontarior and thatthere are more color scanners per capita in Toronto than anywhere else in theworld.andP;  That latter statistic is indicative of a sophistication in graphicarts that will be useful in selling any of Scangraphic's products, but itwill be especially significant when Scangraphic introduces its color systemat Drupa.andM;With offices in Toronto and Montreal, Photographix has installed 55 Printwareplain-papers printers and 23 Itek Graphix IGX 7000 typesetters.andP;  It earliersold a large number of Itek PTW systems before the product was discontinued.andM;Photographix employs 27 people, including six in sales, six in service, fourin support and the rest in various administrative roles.andP;  It does no proudctdevelopment.andP;  The key personnel are Bob Brown, president, who started thecompany in 1980 after spending 16 years with Varityper, and Graham Douglas,sales manager, who was with Varityper for five years.andM;Output devices.andP;  Although Photographix is hoping that the Canadian market'sinterest in quality typesetting will generate sales of Scangraphic'sCommander workstation and input scanner, the most successful item is likelyto be the 120-pica 2051 and the 72-pica 2030 PostScript output devices.andO;(Scangraphic said it has delivered several hundred PostScript machines inEurope since initial shipments at the end of May.)andM;As we have reported before, the output units themselves are capable ofachieving extremely high quality results, partly because they incorporateinternal drjms and involve no movement of the photo material during exposure.andO;In this respect, they are unlike competitive machines on the market,including the quality-oriented Optronics CorlSetter 2000, which spins itsexternal drum at high speed during imaging.andP;  The Scangraphic units, whichoffer three selectable resolutions up to 3,252 dpi, maintain a constanctdistance between the laser light source and the phot material, whichminimizes the likelihood of distortion s dots are laid down.andM;One advantage of this technology is that the photo medium can be imaged anynumber of times, which makes it possible to mix Scangraphic and PostScriptelements freely on any page.andP;  The machine first images data from one sourceanywhere on the medium and then goes back and adds other data anywhere it iscalled for.andM;Recent additions to the product line include the use of 286-MB SCSI drives(two drives are supported on the 2030, three on the 2051) and a 42MB SyQuestcartridge tape drive for backup.andM;In Canada, Photographix will sell the 2051 with a PostScript RIP but noScangraphic RIP for $128,900 (equivalent to $110,000 U.S.) and the 2030 for$89,900 (U.S.andP;  $76,500).andP;  With a Scangraphic RIP and no PostScript RIP theprices will be $126,900 (U.S.andP;  $108,000) and $89,900 (U.S.andP;  $76,500),respectively.andM;To add a PostScript RIP to a machine equipped with a Scangraphic one costs$28,900 (U.S.andP;  $24,500).andM;Photographix emphasizes that if it works out a deal to sell the machines inthe U.S., pricing will have to be worked out and it may not correspondprecisely to Canadian pricing.andM;Commander.andP;  In the Photographix booth, Scangraphic personnel weredemonstrating the Commander workstation, much as it hs been shown previously.andO;It still runs on proprietary hardware.andP;  Features continue to be added,though.andP;  Among the latest are a few enhancements to the graphicscapabilities.andP;  Halftones can now be scaled and rotated in the workstation.andM;Line graphics can be crated with a mouse and tablet or from the keyboard,such as by calling for a circle and specifying the weight, radius andstarting point.andP;  It is possible to produce a pie with a piece removed bycrawing a circle with the center connected to the circumference.andP;  Graduatedtints can be created by specifying different values, but the screen doesn'tshow the different gradations.andP;  (It uses the first one defined for alltints.)andM;With the tablet and mouse, the screen shows the x/y position of the mouse.andO;Two points can be marked and connected.andP;  Curves canbe created by defining thestarting point, the ending point and a &quot;help&quot; point.andP;  A line can be subdivideand part of it modified.andM;Elements can be rotated around any user-specified turning point.andM;After graphics have been created, they can be saved on disk and the user canenter text mode to add text to graphic elements.andP;  The only changes that canbe made to graphics while in text mode are the weights of rules.andM;Text can be flowed around created graphics.andM;Gravel Enterprises makes debutandM;Pierre Gravel needs no introduction in Canada (and very little in the U.S.,andO;for that matter), but his new company was given a formal debut on the openingday of the show.andP;  Pierre Gravel Enterprises (PGE) has taken on a broader rolethan any of Pierre's previous operations.andP;  It involves product lines fromBerthold, Alphatype, Scitex, Sun and Ricoh, covering Canada with all of thoseproducts and, in some cases, the U.S.andP;  also.andM;On Sept. 1, Gravel bought the assets of Berthold Canada and obtained theexclusive rights to sell the entire Berthold product line in Canada andnonexclusive rights to sell it in the U.S.andP;  He has taken over former Bertholdoffices in Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver and kept the Berthold Type Centerin Toronto.andP;  In addition, he provides service to 55% of Canada's Alphatypeusers, he claims.andM;Gravel's background.andP;  For readers unfamiliar with Gravel, we'll provide asummary of some of his more recent activities.andM;Although he has been in the typographic industry for 30 years, his currentphase began in 1977 when he founded Alphatype Canada for the purpose ofselling and supporting Alphatype systems in Canada.andP;  When Berthold acquiredAlphatype in 1981, Alphatype Canada became Berthold-Alphatype Canada and itstarted to sell both companies' product lines.andM;In 1986, when Berthold relinquished Alphatype to Klaus Busche, a Germanentrepreneur, Gravel's company retained the right to sell Alphatype productsin Canada.andP;  In 1987, when Busche found himself unable to continue in his roleat Alphatype due to immigration complications, a group of users collaboratedto buy Alphatype from him.andP;  They brought back Don Hase as president, andPierre lost the right to sell Alphatype products in Canada.andP;  He then changedthe name of his company to Berthold Canada, but he didn't give up thebusiness of providing service to Alphatype users.andM;At about this time, Berthold made a brief attempt to have Gravel run a NorthAmerican operation out of his Canadian office, with a few U.S.andP;  locationsalso.andP;  But this effort never got very far.andP;  About a year ago, Bertholdlaunched a major probe in the U.S., opening an office in California andmaking a substantial commitment by hiring a large staff under Tom Malone.andM;That operation didn't last long, though, and by the summer of 1989 the U.S.andO;office had been relieved of its sales responsibilities and most of its staff,although a service and support team was retained.andM;Meanwhile, in Canada, Berthold cut back its effort similarly, changing thecharter of Berthold Canada to performing service only.andP;  For its serviceoperation, it currently rents space in the facilities of Pierre GravelEnterprises in Toronto.andM;As we understand it, for a one-year period, Berthold Canada will run theservice operation for North America, after which service for Canada will behanded over to PGE.andP;  No announcement has been made regarding service in theU.S.andP;  after that year, but customer support for the U.S.andP;  has already beenrealigned to report to Pierre Gravel.andM;Product lines.andP;  Items in the booth included the Syntax system developed byMagna, Berthold's M-Series, the Sofha Post-Script RIP, Macintoshes usingBerthold fonts, a Scitex system interfaced to the M-Series, and asophisticated Ricoh copier that PGE thinks will be popular among graphic artsusers.andP;  The Scitex interface was new at the show.andM;* Syntax.andP;  As part of the Berthold line, PGE demonstrated the Syntax systemdeveloped by Magna and sold in the U.S.andP;  by Magna as MagnaFile.andP;  The onlydifferences between Magna-File and Syntax are that the latter drives onlyBerthold output devices and it offers a link with Berthold's M-Seriessystems.andM;* Scitex interface.andP;  PGE demonstrated its interface to a Scitex system inwhich text, line art and images are transmitted and incorporated into Scitexcolor pages.andP;  The Series-M is connected to the Berthold Raster Image Server(RIS) through the DataBox 250.andP;  The RIS processes the data and sends it tothe Scitex system.andM;* Sofha PostScript RIP.andP;  The PostScript RIP has been tested successfully withinput from PageMaker, Xpress, FreeHand and Illustrator, but it isn'tguaranteed to be compatible with other applications.andP;  It comes with a 380-MBhard disk storing up to 1,400 Berthold Diamond PostScript fonts (35 fonts areincluded in the basic price), 8 to 16 MB of memory and two ports (AppleTalk,Centronics parallel or RS-232 serial).andP;  It supports a maximum page size of12&quot; X 25&quot;.andM;At the show, it was driving an ECRM PelBox recorder.andP;  We haven't run ourspeed tests on the system yet, but it has the disadvantage of having tofinish recording one job before the RIP can begin processing the next one.andO;PGE is selling the Sofha RIP for $36,000 in Canada ($30,000 in the U.S.).andM;Sears installation.andP;  PGE reported that its showcase Berthold customer site,the Sears retail store chain, is progressing well with its 52-workstationSeries-M system.andP;  The layout is created on the Series-M workstation and textis flowed in.andP;  One important requirement is the ability to handle changes incertain parts of the data to allow for differences between geographic areasand to handle a French version as well as an English one.andP;  Black-and-whitephotos are scanned on a Berthold scanner, retouched with Berthold'sProfiImage software and merged with text on the screen.andM;One capability being added to the system is a check of accuracy of theBerthold data file against the original database stored on a mainframecomputer.andM;Composed pages are sent to a Scitex system either with images in place orwith image boxes making spaces where color is to be inserted.andP;  The interfaceenables the Berthold operator to specify the positioning of elements on theScitex film, the distance between pages, the resolution, portrait orlandscape orientation, right or wrong reading, desired scaling factors (20% to 400%), etc.andM;The Scitex interface software runs in an IBM PC.andM;G.O.'s Double PlayandM;In the booth of dealer Fred Simper, G.O.andP;  Graphics' Deskset was demonstrated.andO;The latest addition to the line (although it wasn't shown) is support for aSigma Designs LaserView monitor as a second screen on the system.andP;  As text iskeyed in compose mode on the regular PC screen, it appears immediately on theLaserView in WYSIWYG format.andP;  G.O.andP;  Graphics calls this its Double Play.andO;Besides the 19&quot; 1,664 X 1,200-pixel LaserView, it runs with a 15&quot; 12,280 X800-pixel Wyse 700 screen.andM;Amgraf shows formsandM;Amgraf appeared in the Linotype booth, emphasizing its new formscapabilities.andP;  As readers probably recall, Amgraf's Mecca III system, whichruns on a PC under Unix, has been targeted at the market for technicaldocumentation with illustrations.andP;  The latest release (version 5.0) isfocused more on producing forms.andM;Version 5.0 also includes support for TIFF, graduated screens, the ability toflow text around irregular shapes, hyphenation in seven European languages(French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Italian and Finnish), bettercontrol over the aesthetic quality of circle text, and improvements toexisting features such as vertical justification, output drivers and databackup.andM;But the main item is forms composition.andP;  The forms program features aversatile box attributes menu (see photo) that controls the weight, style,color and screen values of the edges and corners of any box (with each cornersupporting independent types and radii).andP;  Bars used within forms can beassigned starting colors, ending colors, gradation angle and screen value,with a different setup available for odd and even bars.andM;Boxes can be divided horizontally and vertically in several different ways,such as by specifying the number of divisions or by marking two points andhaving the system divide the box accordingly.andM;To create a form, the system provides a stylus and a four-button mouse formarking coordinates, a grid that can be locked or unlocked (and moved toachieve a new alignment), 16 layers for assigning colors, horizontal andvertical alignment by command (centered or flushed left or right, with auser-definable offset from rules), and true-font display for the basic 35LaserWriter Plus set.andM;Text can be imported from another system or typed within Mecca III.andP;  Itshould be typed in the order in which it will appear in the form.andP;  When theoperator opens the file, the screen displays the first five items to verifythat it is the correct file.andP;  It's a little cumbersome to change fonts withina form (such as to change a word or phrase to italic), which requires markingthe word or phrase and going back to the word processor.andM;Speed of painting the screen was on the slow side, but Amgraf said it willoffer a new graphics board in January that should increase the speed by morethan tenfold.andM;Amgraf isn't supporting chokes and spreads yet, but they will be part of thenext major software release, scheduled for next March.andM;Mecca III drives PostScript and Autologic APS typesetters.andP;  If an APS machinesupports the GICL graphics capabilities, Amgraf accommodates by takingadvantage of them.andM;Color printing.andP;  The other main item of interest in the Amgraf portion of theLinotype booth was a method of printing three colors from one plate.andP;  Thesecret, not surprisingly, is that Mecca produces a three-part file that canbe output on a single plate on a Linotronic (or other) typesetter.andP;  The plateis printed on a Rockwell Trident press that applies the appropriate colors tothe three plate images and prints them in one pass.andM;The samples we saw looked good.andM;Crosfield to ship 9500andM;Crosfield demonstrated its full line of products, including the Studio 9500that had been given a U.S.andP;  introduction at Graph Expo.andP;  We were told thatseveral 9500s have been sold since that debut, with deliveries expected totake place on Jan. 1.andM;Also on display was the new CLS 2.0 system with its top-notch compositionfeatures, which we have covered previously.andM;Changes at DSandM;Dainippon Screen announced some changes both to its U.S.andP;  presence and to itsCanadian operation.andP;  In the U.S., the news was that Ken Cloud has been namedpresident of DS America.andP;  Cloud, who has been operating his own consultingbusiness recently, served as vice president with Scitex from 1983 to 1987.andO;Prior to that he had been with Compugraphic's One Systems operation, andearlier worked for Harris and Atex.andM;Cloud, who will begin on January 9 based in Chicago, replaces Shoji Sakiyama,who becomes chairman of the board.andP;  His extensive experience in the Americanmarket will be an advantage as DS attempts to increase its presence here.andM;Meanwhile, in Canada, there has been a change in the reporting structure asDainippon Screen Canada now reports directly to Japan.andP;  It had been part ofthe U.S.andP;  operation.andP;  The new president of the Canadian unit is ReidMannings, who has spent more than six years with the company.andP;  Prior tojoining DS, he had been responsible for Du Pont's proofing productsnationally.andM;DS has five dealers in Canada, with branches across the country.andM;DS has opened a technical center in its main office in Toronto.andM;Color copiers/printersandM;We have reported previously on attempts to turn color copiers into printers,and Graphic Trade gave us a chance to pursue this topic.andP;  We saw onecurrently under development and another one that might go this route in thefuture, although it hasn't been committed yet.andM;Computer Graphic Systems/Texnai.andP;  One company well on its way to producing acolor system based on the Canon CLC-500 laser copier is Texnai, of Japan,whose product was demonstrated by Computer Graphic Systems, of Toronto, whichis now a division of Letraset.andM;The project is being done in conjunction with Canon.andP;  Texnai scans originalson the 400-dpi CLC-500 and sends the data to a '386-PC system, wherearchiving, retrieval and image editing can be done.andP;  The archiving andretrieval system, called LaserFile II, provides keyword indexing and displaysthumbnail views of images for selection.andP;  It uses optical discs andWinchester disks for storage.andM;The color paint program, called Yui, supports both RGB and HLS color models,eight bits for each color.andP;  Features include cutting and pasting selectedportions of images, global and local color correction, freehand drawing witha variety of pens and insertion of text from the keyboard.andP;  At the show,Computer Graphic Systems was demonstrating scanning a parrot, changing thecolor of its eye and beak, and printing it out; colorizing a black-and-whitepicture of two zebras by making one green and the other purple; and similaractivities.andM;The scanning programs, which scans originals up to 11&quot; X 17&quot;, provides aquick prescan pass to enable cropping prior to a 400-dpi scan.andP;  Thefull-resolution scan takes about 30 seconds.andM;A Macintosh interface is being developed now.andP;  A PC interface will follow in6-12 months.andP;  Although the system is being demonstrated publicly, customershipments may not begin for close to a year.andP;  Thus, it is too early to quotedefinite prices, but we were given an estimate for a full system: about$130,000 Canadian ($110,000 U.S.).andM;Computer Graphic Systems expects to sell the system in both Canada and theU.S.andP;  A seven-year-old company, it has been a division of Letraset since lastyear.andM;Fuji's photographic copier.andP;  Fuji demonstrated a new color copier that hasn'tbeen adapted for use as a digital printer yet, but it appears that it couldbe.andP;  It employs the same analog-to-digital converter that Fuji uses in itsScanart 30II monochrome scanner, and, we were told, it has the potential toaccept digital input.andP;  Apparently no decision has been made regardingadapting the machine to printing applications.andM;In contrast to the Canon CLC-500, the Fuji AP5000 uses a photographicprocess.andP;  That is, it images on photographic media that are processedchemically.andP;  This gives it a higher cost per copy (about $3.50 for an 8&quot; X10&quot;), but it provides advantages in quality and durability that come withphotographic media.andM;It includes a lens mounted horizontally below the platen, with a 45[degrees]mirror to deflect the image through the lens to the photographic medium.andP;  Asthe lens assembly moves horizontally to scan the original, the paper or filmmoves vertically from the bottom to the top of the unit, being exposed as itmoves.andM;Some of the f eatures of the AP5000 are:andM;* Types of originals.andP;  The machine includes a transparency scanner as well asthe platen for accepting opaque originals up to A3 size (11-3/4&quot; X 16-1/4&quot;).andO;For 35mm film, an optional enlarger is available.andM;* Color correction.andP;  Using the control panel on the front of the machine, theoperator can adjust the CYM values independently by deviating in seven stepsin either direction from the normal value.andM;* Zooming.andP;  Originals can be reproduced from 50% to 200%--a smaller rangethan the Canon machine has, but larger than most copiers.andM;* Speed.andP;  It takes 5 min.andP;  and 40 sec.andP;  for the first copy, after whichadditional prints of the some original can be done at a rate of 100 per hour.andM;* Media supply.andP;  Two rolls of paper (high or low contrast) or film can bemounted at a time and selected for use.andP;  The machine knows which type ofmateral is being used and adjusts accordingly.andM;* Chemical supply.andP;  The AP500 is about as hassle-free as any chemical-basedprocess we have seen.andP;  Developer, fixer and rinse are stored in three bottlesin the machine's cabinet.andP;  The fresh chemicals are in a plastic bag withinthe plastic bottle.andP;  As chemicals are used, the bag shrinks, allowing spacefor the used chemicals to be deposited in the original bottle, around theoutside of the bag.andP;  The control panel indicates how much remains in the bag.andO;When it is empty, the operator removes the old bottle and inserts a new one.andM;* User conveniences.andP;  Other conveniences include a temperature indicator, anautomatic on/off timer and automatic roller cleaning.andM;Ultimate adds indexingandM;Ultimate Technographics introduced an indexing option for its ProfessionalPublishing System.andP;  It enables the operator to flag words in a text file thatwill be indexed automatically in a batch operation.andP;  Words that don't appearin the text (such as concepts that are being discussed without mentioningthem by name) can be flagged by inserting a note in comment (nontypesetting)mode.andM;Words or phrases are flagged by either embedding one code to begin theexpression and another one to end it, or, in the case of a single word,specifying &quot;index word,&quot; which inserts the appropriate codes around the word.andO;If multiple words and phrases are to be indexed within the same expression,as many as 10 different index entries can be specified.andM;The system was designed to handle only two levels of entries: the main leveland one subordinate one.andP;  However, it is possible to create additional levelsusing the system's text-conversion program, which requires running a separatepass over the file.andM;There is no provision for handling cross-references, although Ultimate saysthat these, too, can be accommodated through the text-conversion program.andM;As many as 10,000 entries can be included in any index.andM;The system creates an index file that can be edited and composed in the samemanner as any text file.andP;  Entries are sorted alphabetically.andP;  In cases wherewords get hyphenated, the system ignores the hyphen.andP;  Words that begin withupper-lower-case letters are sorted differently from those starting withlower-case letters, which keeps proper names separate from words that arespelled the same.andP;  But it means that manual intervention will be required tore-sort entries that have been capitalized because they begin a sentence.andM;A sample file we tested took about eight seconds to index 43 pages (theUltimate system manual).andM;The indexing option costs $995.andM;Scitex using Al diagnosticsandM;Scitex, which has supported remote diagnostics for several years,demonstrated a new diagnostic program based on artificial intelligencetechniques.andP;  It enables remote service personnel using portable computers todial into the main office and get assistance in solving customers' problems.andO;The assistance comes in the form of easy-to-use menus and diagramsillustrating how to replace parts, etc.andP;  The suggestions run the gamut fromcleaning mirrors to replacing lasers.andP;  Artificial intelligence is employed tosift through the data and suggest approaches.andM;The system provides several other key advantages besides quick advice.andP;  Bylogging into the Scitex computer and reporting whatever problems have arisen,the service person is also recording the history of the equipment at thatsite.andP;  Then, at a later time, it is possible to refer to the history to aidin solving other problems.andP;  And it also provides Scitex with an organizeddatabase of problems being encountered, which may be useful in analyzing theperformance of various products.andM;Another benefit Scitex gets is that it can prepare new personnel for servicepositions more quickly than previously.andP;  Knowing the resources the servicepeople will have available at a customer's site enables the trainers to focuson other areas during training.andM;This program, which is now in use in the field, currently supports the Dolevand Eray devices only, but others will be added.andP;  Moreover, new products arebeing designed with this kind of diagnostics in mind.andM;Assembler tutor.andP;  Another relatively new item in the Scitex booth was a tutorprogram for teaching customers to use the Assembler workstation (and otherworkstations with the same users interface, such as the Rightouch).andP;  Theprogram contains five modules, with multiple lessons in each.andP;  The course isself-paced, but is expected to take about 20 hours to complete.andM;Each lesson covers three areas: demonstrations of the item being covered,step-by-step exercises, and test questions.andP;  As the operator works, thesystem keeps track of time spent and mistakes made, giving the supervisor achance to evaluate each trainee.andP;  At the end of the course, there is a finaltest.andM;The program provides a glossary of terms and a &quot;map&quot; of the whole system forthe trainee's reference during the course.andM;The program requires a '286 PC with a 40-MB disk, 1 MB of memory, VGA monitorand tablet.andP;  It can be rented for $2,700 for three months or purchased.andP;  Thehandled price of the hardware and software is $11,000; the softwae alonecosts $7,000.andM;Riso back with duplicatorandM;At Comdex two years ago, Nissho demonstrated a duplicating machine with aControl-C PostScript RIP that enabled printing multiple copies of documentsextremely inexpensively.andP;  The machine was based on a thermal process that cuta master &quot;stencil&quot; wrapped around an ink-filled drum.andP;  It was capable ofreceiving data from a computer or scanning an original and creating themaster from it.andP;  We were told that the resolution was 400 dpi, which led usto comment that it wasn't nearly as good as 400-dpi machines based on othertechnology.andM;In much the same fashion as mimeograph  machines used to work, this printeris capable of high-speed (60-120 pages per minute), low-cost duplicating,even handling different colors by changing the ink cartridge in the middle ofthe drum.andP;  (Multicolor printing is possible by running the paper throughmultiple passes, although registration is obviously precarious.)andM;The printing technology comes from a Japanese company called Riso Kagaku.andM;We saw the machine again at Comdex last year, but not at a graphic arts showuntil Graphic Trade '89, where Riso Distributors brought it out anddemonstrated it being driven by an AT running a word processing program, aswell as by scanning a document and cutting the master simultaneously.andP;  (Ittook about 16 seconds to scan an original and cut the master.)andM;The machine was going by the name Risograph 3500CI (for computer interface).andO;We were told that the interface was new--and perhaps it was a new onedeveloped by Riso, not merely the Nissho one dusted off for this occasion.andM;We were told also that the machine can scan an image, save it as a TIFF file,send it to the computer to be merged with text in a document, and thenreceive the document and print it.andP;  This wasn't demonstrated, though.andM;Unfortunately, the document coming from the computer didn't provide anopportunity to judge the quality of a typical published document (seesample).andP;  Based on the limited output we saw, our earlier comment remainstrue: this isn't equivalent to 400-dpi output from a laser printer.andP;  But ourother comment also remains true: this is an extremely inexpensive means ofmaking copies, if the quality is good enough.andM;Medium-resolution Canon printersandM;One of the demonstrations of particular interest was in the booth of FredSimper, who sells a variety of laser printers as well as publishing software.andO;Fred had the latest printers from LaserMaster and Raster Image ProcessingSystems, which use the same Canon SX engine.andP;  LaserMaster was claiming todrive it at 1,000 X 400 dpi, while RIPS said it achieved 800 X 400.andM;Fred's tack was to sell them for the same price and to ask visitors to thebooth which one they thought looked better.andP;  As the end of the showapproached, he called the contest a draw.andP;  Although a lot of people claimedto see a difference, about half of them favored one, half the other.andM;Next year, Montreal, then Toronto in '91andM;The organizers have planned a smaller, more regional show for next year, totake place in Montreal.andP;  It will be called Graphi Montreal '90, to be heldOct. 13-16.andM;Then Graphic Trade will take place at the same Toronto site in October1991--just after the mammoth Print 91 show scheduled for Chicago inSeptember.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
