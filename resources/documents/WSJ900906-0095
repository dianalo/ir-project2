Or so it now appears. The surge of Iraqitroops and tanks into Kuwait early on Aug. 2 wrong-footed atleast three governments, if one goes by the behavior of theiremployees. At least one very senior U.S. defense official wascalmly driving off for vacation. The British ambassador toIraq, Harold &quot;Hooky&quot; Walker, was on holiday in Woking. Thechief of Israeli military intelligence was enjoying his ownwedding party.   This nonchalant posture becomes all the more incredible inlight of the menacing tempo of events in the preceding threemonths. In May Saddam Hussein was announcing loudly that hispatience was almost exhausted. The war against Iran, financedlargely by the Gulf states to shield themselves from theayatollah, had bled Iraq dry. Kuwait's and Abu Dhabi'sflouting of OPEC production guidelines was keeping oil pricesat rock bottom and denying Iraq desperately needed revenues.</LP><TEXT>   Even if the West didn't get the message, or chose not tolisten to it, Kuwait's ruling family certainly did. By Maybrokers in the Asian markets were beginning to noticesubstantial selling by the London-based Kuwait InvestmentOffice, which manages Kuwait's $100 billion portfolio. Bylate July, as the Far Eastern Economic Review later describedit, Kuwait was getting out of its Asian stocks and into cashwith as much speed as prudence would permit, given that ahasty fire sale could have brought several Asian marketscrashing down, so vast were KIO's holdings.   Even if the U.S. did not care to notice the Asian markets,it surely had contacts inside Kuwait's ruling family. On July18 Kuwait's cabinet sat down to consider the mounting crisis.London's Financial Times later acquired the minutes. Werethey unavailable to the U.S. ambassador?   First to speak was Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait'sfinance minister: &quot;Iraq is going to continue escalating thelevel of confrontation.&quot;   Next spoke Kuwait's interior minister, Sheikh Salemal-Sabah. He too was uneasy. Iraq, he advised, might wellhave profited from the political turmoil in June, whenKuwait's emir had refused to restore the Parliament hesuspended in 1986, permitting only an interim assembly.   &quot;There is a possibility of Iraqi aggression,&quot; said SheikhSabah al Ahmad al-Sabah, the foreign minister. Dharial-Othman, the justice minister, concurred. &quot;The Iraqimemorandum {which demanded compensation for $2.4 billion inoil `stolen' from the Rumaila field} is just the beginning.God knows how far they will go.&quot;   Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, the crown prince andprime minister, put it clearly: &quot;The Iraqis could takemilitary measures.&quot; He urged Kuwait's military and securityforces to be on the alert.   Kuwait's increasingly desperate maneuvers culminated atthe Jidda mediation talks on Aug. 1, the day before theinvasion. Sheikh Sabah, the foreign minister, later toldEgypt's al-Mussawar magazine that in Jidda Kuwait agreed towrite off Iraq's $15 billion war debt and to lease Warbahisland to Iraq as an oil outlet for the Rumaila field.   These were major concessions, but only a few hours laterSaddam gave the order to march.   What were Saddam's intelligence chief and ambassadorstelling him about the U.S. government, even as it headed forthe beaches of August? The question surely gnawed at theIraqi president as he paced his command bunker. It was thebillion-dollar question. All through the '80s the U.S. hadappeased him, armed him, given him the green light to invadeIran. If he grabbed Kuwait, what would it do now?   Two days earlier, on July 31, John Kelly, assistantsecretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs,walked into the Rayburn building to testify before the MiddleEast subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   After Mr. Kelly's formal statement, Chairman Lee Hamilton(D., Ind.) began to press him. Mr. Hamilton had read &quot;anindirect quotation in the press that Secretary {of DefenseRichard} Cheney said that the United States' commitment wasto come to Kuwaiti -- to Kuwait's defense if it is attacked.&quot;Was that statement accurate? Mr. Hamilton wondered. Could Mr.Kelly please clarify?   The following exchange may have launched a war and changedthe face of the Middle East forever:   Mr. Kelly: &quot;I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman. I'm not familiarwith the quotation that you just referred to, but I amconfident in the administration's position on the issue. Wehave no defense treaty relationship with any Gulf country.That is clear. We support the security and independence offriendly states in the region. Ever since the Trumanadministration we've maintained naval forces in the Gulfbecause of our interest in stability in that region. We arecalling for a peaceful resolution of any differences in thatarea and we hope, and trust, and believe that the sovereigntyof every state in the Gulf ought to be respected.&quot;   Rep. Hamilton: &quot;Now, do we have a commitment to ourfriends in the Gulf, in the event that they are engaged inoil or territorial disputes with their neighbors?&quot;   Mr. Kelly: &quot;As I said, Mr. Chairman, we have no defensetreaty relationships with any of the countries. We havehistorically avoided taking a position on border disputes oron internal OPEC deliberations, but we have certainly, ashave all administrations, resoundingly called for thepeaceful settlement of disputes and differences in the area.&quot;   Rep. Hamilton: &quot;If there -- if Iraq, for example, chargedacross the border into Kuwait and -- for whatever reason --what would be our position with regard to the use of U.S.forces?&quot;   Mr. Kelly: &quot;That, Mr. Chairman, is a hypothetical or acontingency question, the kind of which I can't get into.Suffice it to say we would be extremely concerned, but Icannot get into the realm of `what if' answers.&quot;   Rep. Hamilton: &quot;In that circumstance, it is correct tosay, however, that we do not have a treaty commitment whichwould obligate us to engage U.S. forces there?&quot;   Mr. Kelly: &quot;That is correct.&quot;   This exchange did not go unnoticed. The next day, theFinancial Times's Washington correspondent was reporting tohis London office apropos the Gulf crisis &quot;the one strikingpublic statement, that the U.S. has no defensive treatieswith Kuwait or any of its neighbors.&quot;   More to the point, Mr. Kelly's testimony was reported onthe BBC's World Service. For Saddam, in those final fatefulhours, it was surely the decisive sign. The U.S. might fumeand fret after the event, but it would do nothing.   In the wake of Pearl Harbor, Republicans charged PresidentRoosevelt with luring the Japanese to attack Pearl Harbor.Today, in the wake of Iraq's attack, Democrats could assoundly charge that Saddam had good reason to believe thatthe U.S. government was waving him across the border ofKuwait.   ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and theAnderson Valley (Calif.)
