Thus, borehole resonances,a type of tube wave that is prominent in many real VSPs, are typicallymissing in synthetic VSPs. Characteristics of generation and propagationof borehole resonances can be studied by including details of the boreholeenvironment in acoustic and elastic finite-difference simulations. Specificmodels presented incorporate a variety of hole diameters, cased and uncasedholes, the presence of geophones within a hole, a variety of source positions,the effects of local changes in hole diameter and lithology, and themutual interaction of the response of two neighboring wells. The mainconclusion is that the hole and the medium should be considered as asingle coupled system as there is a continuous mutual transfer of energybetween them.</TEXT></DOC>
