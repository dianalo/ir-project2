<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-1099 </DOCNO><TEXT>Measurements of isotope shifts (IS) and the hyperfine structures (HFS)of optical lines for Eu, Tm, Sm, Nd, Ho isotope chains are carried outby the method of resonance photoionization at the IRIS mass-separator.The information on the isotope change of charged radii (CR) and electromagneticnuclei moments is obtained from IS and HFS analysis. Sharp dependenceof 3P nuclei change behaviour on Z in the region of 50{le}Z, N{le}82is detected. The change of 3P dependence on jump at Z=63 to comparativelysmooth at Z=69 is established for nuclei in the region of strongly deformedand transition nuclei (82andless;Nandless;100). The 3P isotope changes are shown tobe sensitive to the choice of effective interaction, that can be usefulwhen choosing the parameters of this interaction on the basis of experimentaldata. 9 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
