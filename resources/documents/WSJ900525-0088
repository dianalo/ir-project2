The SEC, which made its assault in the report of its studyof the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage last October, is certain to use the report asammunition in its newly escalated battle with the CommodityFutures Trading Commission. The SEC, along with the TreasuryDepartment, is proposing to switch regulatory oversight ofstock-index futures from the CFTC.</LP><TEXT>   Stock-index futures, which are traded on the commodityexchanges, allow investors to bet on the direction of abasket of stocks without ever owning the securities.   The Oct. 13 plunge, during which the securities marketshad paper losses of $190 billion, was stunningly fast. In theroughly 90 minutes after UAL Corp. announced that itsleveraged buy-out had collapsed, the Dow fell almost nonstopuntil it closed at 6.9% down from the day's opening level.Volume levels were massive, with 112 million shares changinghands in the final hour, alone.   That decline, coming on a Friday, touched off widespreadconcern that the following Monday would result in another1987-style crash. But share prices rebounded on Oct. 16 aftera sharp early morning drop, and the market stabilized.   The SEC study, which in some aspects directly disputes areport issued by the CFTC earlier this week, shows that lastOctober's slide was in many ways similar to the 1987 crash.In particular, the SEC report contends that computer-aidedprogram trading -- in this case index arbitrage, the mostcommon form of program trading -- accounted for an unusuallyhigh percentage of share volume during the 190-point decline.   Index arbitrage is a technique that seeks to profit fromprice differences between index futures and the basket ofstocks represented in the futures.   But the report also shows some significant differencesbetween the 1989 minicrash and the 1987 plunge. Selling onthe futures markets centered on &quot;small and large speculativeaccounts, foreign accounts, options market makers and majorbroker-dealers,&quot; the SEC said. Institutional investors, suchas banks, mutual funds and pension funds, which were themajor culprits of the 1987 crash, were net buyers in lastyear's slide.   Moreover, the SEC contended that Chicago MercantileExchange floor traders, or locals, were net sellers duringmost of the 1989 collapse. Indeed, &quot;locals were the mostactive aggregate sellers from 2:40 to 4:15,&quot; the SEC said,representing almost 25% of the selling in Standard andamp; Poor's500stock index futures during the period. &quot;We did not findthat the futures floor provided any net liquidity,&quot; saidRichard Ketchum, the SEC's head of market regulation, whoheaded up the study.   That part of the report contrasts sharply with the studyissued just days ago by the CFTC. While the commoditiesregulators' work also shows that institutions were buyers, itdoesn't single out futures pit locals as culprits. Indeed,CFTC officials, who used the same data as SEC staffers,wondered about the SEC's conclusions. &quot;Locals are largeparticipants on both sides in most time periods,&quot; StevenManaster, the CFTC's chief economist, said yesterday.&quot;Sometimes they'll be a little long, and sometimes they'll bea little short.&quot;   The SEC said that selling by futures traders hit a peak of50% of the total futures sell volume during one 10-minuteperiod that was studied. Mr. Ketchum said that by contrast,specialists on the New York Stock Exchange were &quot;substantialnet buyers&quot; during the periods of peak stress.   But the biggest problem was index arbitrage, the SECreport said. &quot;Index arbitrage and other program sellingsignificantly accelerated and exacerbated the marketdecline,&quot; the report added. Program selling accounted for 36%of the total Sandamp;P 500 shares traded when futures weren'tsubject to price limits, the study said, higher thanaggregate index-arbitrage levels during the 1987 crash.   That view also is disputed by the CFTC study, whichconcluded that &quot;there was not an extraordinary amount ofindex arbitrage activity . . . either in absolute terms or inrelation to total NYSE volume.&quot;   The SEC also said that the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; triggered bythe Oct. 13 decline appears to have slowed the decline. Therestriction, one of several put in place after the 1987 crashto slow sharp market moves, was set off when the ChicagoMerc's Sandamp;P 500 futures contract had fallen 12 points.Contract prices weren't allowed to decline further for ahalf-hour.   Switching on the circuit breaker &quot;coincided with a sharpdrop-off in the level of program selling on the NYSE and areduction in the rate of price decline in NYSE stocks,&quot; theSEC said. After the price limit expired, the SEC reportadded, the price decline in Big Board shares accelerated.   In fact, the Merc's circuit breaker worked so well,Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, said that perhaps the exchangeshould consider keeping it in place until the end of atrading session, rather than for just 30 minutes. The futuresmarkets aren't likely to be thrilled by Mr. Breeden'ssuggestion that they shut down the pits in periods of stress.   The SEC surely will use the new report to press its caseon Capitol Hill for more regulatory clout. The report'sfindings &quot;underline the interrelationship between thesemarkets,&quot; Mr. Breeden said. &quot;It demonstrates the validity ofthe administration's point of view that because we have asingle market&quot; of stocks and index futures, a singleregulator should oversee both.   Separately, Mr. Breeden offered the first details of howthe SEC would change the stock-index futures market if itwins congressional approval for a change in regulatoryjurisdiction.   Mr. Breeden suggested that index-futures investors shouldbe subject to securities-style protections concerning insidertrading, anti-fraud provisions and suitability standards thatforce brokers to make certain that the products are right forthe customer.   Futures-industry officials have argued in the past thatthe products are used almost exclusively by largeinstitutional investors, who don't need the same level ofprotection that many stock-market investors require.</TEXT></DOC>
