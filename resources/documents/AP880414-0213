The decision reversed a drive one day earlier in which theleaders had sought to persuade union representatives to acceptdropping the plant-closing provision to avoid a threatened veto byPresident Reagan.   As a result of the decision, the fate of the sweeping,1,000-page trade bill that Congress has been fashioning for threeyears was placed in jeopardy.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said an expanding tradegap demonstrated that ``now is not the time to let the trade billgo down the tubes, but that is exactly what will happen if theplant-closing and the foreign investment-disclosure provisionsremain in the package.''   Another target of administration veto warnings has been aprovision that would require public disclosure of sizeable foreigninvestment in the United States. Lawmakers have not decided yetwhether to include that measure in the trade bill.   Democrats said the reversal came amid intense pressure Thursdaymorning on House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, from within theDemocratic Caucus not to abandon unions in their quest for theplant-closings provisions. They said the United Auto Workers andother labor groups lobbied furiously Wednesday night and Thursdaymorning to build support among caucus members.   ``Unfortunately, a single issue has emerged that threatens todefeat the entire bill,'' said House Ways and Means Chairman DanRostenkowski, D-Ill. ``I hope in the coming days that thepresident, members of Congress, business and labor groups willcarefully consider the price the nation will pay if we fail toenact this essential legislation.''   White House spokesman B.J. Cooper issued a reminder that sixCabinet officers wrote to lawmakers ``two weeks ago telling theHill that they would recommend a veto if plant closings was in thebill.''   But a statement from Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., indicated that they would press forward with thebill including the plant-closings provision.   ``We have consulted extensively with our colleagues,'' astatement from Democratic leaders said. ``Given today's tradefigures and the resulting plunge in the stock market, we nowbelieve strongly that we should move as quickly as possible with astrong trade and competitiveness bill, including protections forworkers who are about to be laid off or whose plants are about toclose.''   The statement said that they had ``gone more than halfway tomeet administration concerns.''   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, whohad long campaigned for such a measure, said that he expected theSenate to take up the bill within the next several weeks andpredicted overwhelming support for it.   ``Concern for the trade numbers hardens support for the bill asit stands, and when the market fell, that tilted it to the finaldecision to go ahead,'' Bentsen said in a statement.   Earlier Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.trade deficit widened dramatically in February to $13.8 billion,its biggest shortfall since October and the second straightincrease. Wall Street reacted with a 101.46 drop in the Dow JonesIndustrial Average.   The plant-closing provision would require companies with atleast 100 employees to provide 60-day notice of plant closings andlayoffs involving at least one-third of their work force. Layoffsof 500 or more, even if less than one-third of the work force,would have to be preceded by notice.   Democrats said that another key factor that prompted Wright'sdecision to press forward with the provision was intense pressurewithin the Democratic Caucus, many of whose members were lobbiedheavily by labor unions.   Labor, which was counting on the provision, already was rankledafter lawmakers jettisoned a provision of the bill sponsored byRep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., calling for 10 percent rollbacksin Japanese and several other nations' trade surpluses with theUnited States.   Thursday's decision came as a surprise after the leaders metbehind closed doors Wednesday with union leaders and urged them toaccept dropping the plant-closings provision, which critics havesaid would be too burdensome for business.   Top Reagan administration officials met briefly withcongressional leaders Thursday to discuss trade legislation andthen slipped away without commenting on results of the meeting.   ``We're still exploring it,'' Wright told reporters after the30-minute, closed-door session with Treasury Secretary James A.Baker III and White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.   Wright was asked about reports that lawmakers were unwilling todrop the sweeping, 1,000-page trade bill's controversialplant-closings provision without a guarantee that it would assurethat the president would sign the rest of the measure.   ``I think they understand that,'' Wright said.   The plant-closings plan is among scores of provisions of thetrade bill. The central provisions would transfer authority to theU.S. trade representative to retaliate against violations ofinternational agreements and other ``unjustifiable acts.'' Thepresident now has that power.   Other central provisions would streamline the machinery underwhich the government imposes import curbs to aid Americanbusinesses threatened by surges in imported goods.   Meanwhile, Gephardt told reporters that the plant-closingsprovision should stay in the trade bill and that a number ofDemocrats would abandon their support of the legislation if thelabor-backed provision were dropped.   He said it was by no means clear that Reagan would veto the billif the measure contained plant-closings when it reached his desk.</TEXT></DOC>
