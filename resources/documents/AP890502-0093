Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Bush did notindicate which way he was leaning during a breakfast meeting withGOP leaders, but that the lawmakers strongly advised him to goahead with the deal.   It would be Bush's first approval of a major agriculturalsubsidy. The sale has been the subject of intense disagreement bothwithin the administration and in Congress.   Dole told reporters after the meeting that several lawmakersmade ``strong pitches'' to the president on behalf of the sale,``the point being, if we're going to trade with Soviet Union, whichwe are, then we have to be competitive, we have to meet worldprices.''   ``We made our case to the president,'' said Dole, whose state isa leading grain producer. ``I think there was general agreementamong those this morning that if we're going to be in this tradegame, we've got to be competitive. The subsidy's not very great inthis case, probably not as much as the storage costs.''   The Bush administration, following the lead of the Reaganadministration, has called for eventual elimination of all exportsubsidies. It has said, however, that it would not unilaterally doaway with such government farm support so long as other tradingnations subsidized their exports.   Dole and other participants said Bush indicated he would make uphis mind on the subsidies later today, amid reports that thepresident might decide on partial subsidies for the grain sales.   The administration is divided on the proposed grain sale, withthe Agriculture Department supporting it and the Office ofManagement and Budget and the National Security Council reportedlyopposing it.   The sale would be made under a 1985 law, the Export EnhancementProgram, under which nations that buy U.S. agricultural goodsreceive bonus quantities of commodities from government stockpiles.</TEXT></DOC>
