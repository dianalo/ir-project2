Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush is notwilling to expand the ban and review the administration announcedTuesday to block import of semiautomatics that are not for sportinguse.   ``At this point we are not willing to extend that,'' Fitzwatertold reporters. Although some of the assault weapons produced andsold in the United States are virtually identical to the imports,the spokesman said no curtailment of their manufacture is currentlyenvisioned.   ``We don't see any need for any review or any other changes atall,'' he said. However he did not preclude eventually expanding thereview.   ``We're saying here's an issue that's come to light. We need todeal with it and we'll see where we go,'' he said.   Administration officials describe the ban on imports of AK-47sand other semiautomatic firearms as ``temporary and reversible.''But they say it was necessary to head off an imminent flood of theassault weapons into the United States.   The action Tuesday appeared to be a softening of Bush'soft-stated opposition to gun controls, but Fitzwater said it merelyenforces current law that allows imports of guns only if forsporting purposes.   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, ``shares thepublic concern'' over the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons,but he is not changing his position against a ban on such guns,Fitzwater said.   Vice President Dan Quayle told The Associated Press today that hehad received several ``inquiries'' from people who were concernedabout the administration action.   Quayle declined to elaborate, but he said Bush ``was absolutelyright to enforce the existing regulations we have ... I see it as aserious attempt by President Bush to review the situation.''   Bush had asked national drug control director William J. Bennettlast week to recommend what should be done about the weapons. Callsfor a ban have been prompted by scores of drug-related shootings andthe recent killing of five California schoolchildren.   The action will affect more than 110,000 weapons with pendingapplications for import, Bennett said, including AKS-type firearmssuch as AK-47s, Uzi carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as wellas Steyr Aug semiautomatic weapons.   It does not affect semiautomatic weapons already in this countryor those produced domestically such as the AR15, the civilianversion of the military's .223-caliber M-16.   The decision to suspend imports was made a day after Bennett wassworn in to his new job. Stephen E. Higgins, director of theTreasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, hadraised the issue with Bennett.   ``Higgins mentioned to him this spike, this upsurge in importapplications, and outlined for Bennett what the legal authoritiesand options were,'' said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton.   ATF approved the import of 88,000 such weapons during 1986, 1987and 1988. This year alone, the government has received requests toimport many more than that, with 113,732 applications pending,according to Bennett.   After several more conversations with Higgins and others, ``histhinking was developing along the lines of, this was a temporary andreversible measure,'' Hamilton said.   ``If we keep them out, it's temporary and reversible,'' he said.``If, on the other hand, you let them in, they're in, and it'sirreversible. In the space of several weeks, you could more thandouble the last three year's imports by doing nothing.''   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ whose department includes ATF_ agreed to the import suspension and ordered it Tuesday.   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weaponsinto the United States, to make sure they fall into certaincategories,'' spokesman Dick Pedersen said. ``We're saying some ofthese weapons may not fall into some of the prescribed categories,such as hunting.''   Gun control advocates hailed the move, while even the NRA _ whichhas opposed controls on the weapons _ said it could do some good.   The action would ``put a stop to the media hysteria surroundingthe semiautomatic version of the AK-47 rifle, and should provide anatmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue,'' saidWayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute forLegislative Action.   Before the suspension announcement, NRA President Joe Fossdecried the ``panic'' over semiautomatic weapons and blamed a faultycriminal justice system for the current state of affairs in whichheavily armed drug dealers operate within minutes of the White House.   ``If you think that taking away the guns from those bozos willmake any difference, you've got another thing coming,'' Foss said.``You could outlaw every single gun that there is, and they wouldstill get them.''   Handgun Control spokeswoman Susan Whitmore called the decision a``first step toward public safety.''   ``It's really significant that there's general recognition of theproblem that these combat weapons pose to the safety of not only thenation's law enforcement community but to the citizens all acrossthe country,'' she said.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has introduced legislationthat would ban new assault weapons and require registration of thosealready in circulation, said the import ban is ``a major firststep.''   ``But currently, nothing prevents the manufacture of theseweapons here in the United States,'' Metzenbaum said. ``It isnecessary that we ban the sale of new assault weapons and registerthe ones already in circulation.''   The move came a day after the California State Assembly passed aban on 40 types of semiautomatics; the state Senate had passed asimilar bill earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
