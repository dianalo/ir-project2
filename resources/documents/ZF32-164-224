While nosoftware house is ready to divulge details about possible forthcomingfinancial applications for PenPoint, several developers have begun toenvision just what pen-based spreadsheet and finance packages may look like.andM;&quot;We're confronting some of our old assumptions about spreadsheets,&quot; saysRobert O'Hara, a system architect at Lotus, which is exploring the newtechnology.andM;&quot;It's a challenge for us to break out of the mold.andP;  Nobody's going to write@SUM(B11..B12) onto a pen-based computer.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;users will feel athome in whatever pen-based application we may develop,&quot; asserts O'Hara.andO;&quot;Cultural compatibility is always a concern.&quot;andM;A pen-based financial application from Lotus would be tailored for theportable platform.andP;  &quot;People aren't going to be building models by hand whenthey're on the road,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We wouldn't be doing 1-2-3; it'd be morelike 1-2.&quot;andM;Users will still work in a row-and-column format and use standard formulas,he predicts, but the way they access those formulas could change.andP;  &quot;We'relooking at PenPoint's user interface and asking, What can we do differently?&quot;andO;To sum a column of numbers, users may simply draw a line under the row or usea standard gesture developed specifically for the application.andM;&quot;There's handwriting recognition in PenPoint, but that doesn't meaneverything will be accomplished by hand,&quot; says O'Hara.andP;  Users may accesscommands by tapping a function ribbon running across the top of the notepadscreen, much like the menu strips used by Windows and Macintosh applications,he says.andM;Back to the drawing board.andP;  To understand pen-based financial applications,Norm Francis suggests recalling the pencil and columnar paper that predatethe spreadsheet.andP;  Francis is president of PenMagic Software Inc., a NorthVancouver, British Columbia, startup that is exploring financial andpersonal-information-manager software for pen-based systems.andP;  Don't forgetthat the spreadsheet is just a PC adaptation of traditional accountingpractices,&quot; he points out.andP;  &quot;A 1-2-3 cell is nothing you learned inaccounting.&quot;andM;Instead of using rows and columns, some may find themselves doingcalculations on a bigger version of PenPoint's math paper, a kind of smartfinancial stationery.andP;  This type of document is particularly suited for&quot;people who don't need something overly complex,&quot; says Francis.andM;Spreadsheet pioneer Dan Bricklin says that developers should first establishtheir functional goals and then tailor them to the new pen environment.andO;1-2-3 was developed specifically for the IBM PC, &quot;and that makes a bigdifference&quot; in the way the software operates, says Bricklin, author ofVisiCalc, the first electronic spreadsheet program.andM;One software firm may discard the spreadsheet metaphor entirely to develop a&quot;piece of calculating paper,&quot; he says, while another company, with an eyetoward an installed base of users, may opt to adapt its current applicationsto a pen-based environment.andP;  Each company is going to have to decide whetherto break new ground or develop software that incorporates the needs ofcurrent users, says Bricklin, now a vice president of Slate Corp., aScottsdale, Ariz., startup that shipped its PenApps development software inFebruary.andM;Inspired by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that a majorityof U.S.andP;  professionals still don't use PCs, Go has set its initial sights onsalespeople, service technicians, field engineers, insurance agents, andother professionals for whom a traditional desktop system doesn't work.andO;After that, the sky's the limit.andP;  As Go officials like to point out,pen-based PCs may be new, but everyone already knows how to use a pen andpaper.andM;-TracyMayor</TEXT></DOC>
