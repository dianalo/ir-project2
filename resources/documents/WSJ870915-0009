The panel is seeking to determine whether the judge violated the judicial code of ethics when she spoke to two appeals court judges about the law firm. Under the code, it is improper for a lower-court judge to intercede on behalf of any litigant before a higher court.    Sullivan andamp; Cromwell has denied having anything to do with her efforts. Officials of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct couldn't be reached for comment. According to the official, the commission initiated its inquiry after reading of the judge's efforts in this newspaper last month.    Judge Lambert couldn't be reached for comment. Linda Sosnowitz, her law clerk, said the judge wasn't available for comment.    However, in a recent interview, Judge Lambert insisted her efforts to intercede weren't meant to benefit the law firm but to help settle the case the firm had handled improperly. The firm denies any wrongdoing, but admits making an &quot;error&quot; in the case, from which it was removed.    The underlying case involves a family dispute over the Antiques Company of New York, a prominent dealer in rare antique porcelains. The business was the key asset in a trust of which the co-beneficiaries were Martin Wynyard of Syracuse, N.Y., and his sister, Rotraut Beiny of London.    Two years ago, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell was retained by Mr. Wynyard to represent him in a lawsuit charging his sister with looting the company's assets. (Ms. Beiny denies the accusation.) Assigned to Surrogate Judge Lambert, the case was bitterly fought from the beginning.    In June, a state appeals court accused the Sullivan andamp; Cromwell lawyer handling the case of &quot;grossly improper&quot; conduct for having obtained from another law firm by &quot;stealth&quot; and &quot;deceit&quot; secret files that helped its case. In an move extraordinary for its severity, the appeals court barred Sullivan andamp; Cromwell from representing Mr. Wynyard.    In July, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell sought to have the appeals court reconsider its decision, but the firm was rebuffed. Shortly afterward, Judge Lambert said she &quot;informally approached&quot; Francis Murphy, the presiding judge of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court.    Judge Lambert said she asked to have Sullivan andamp; Cromwell reinstated long enough to settle the case, but, she said, &quot;he indicated he wasn't interested in having them back on any basis.&quot; Judge Murphy has declined to comment on the matter.    According to the state official, Chief Judge Murphy is scheduled to meet with representatives of the judicial committee investigating the incident today.    Judge Lambert also said in the earlier interview that she broached the topic of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell's reinstatement with Judge Betty Weinberg Ellerin, who is a member of the Appellate Division but wasn't on the panel that removed Sullivan andamp; Cromwell from the case.    Judge Ellerin, the official said, has been questioned by investigators about the incident. The judge couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
