These regulationsare issued to fulfill that mandate. The guiding principle behind the standardsis that Department employees must be persons of unquestioned integrityand maintain ethical standards of the highest order. The regulations provideguidance and restrictions for employees to ensure that certain personalor outside activities or interests do not create an actual or apparentconflict of interest with their official duties. In addition, they identifyhow employees are informed and may obtain guidance about the standards,and how disciplinary action may be taken for violations of the standards.The regulations include procedures for confidential reporting of employmentand financial information; however, these provisions will be modified,as appropriate, after OGE issues its final regulations on confidentialreporting requirements. Employees who, in the course of their duties, come to know of criminalviolations or violations of the standard of conduct regulations committedby other employees or another person or organization should report theviolations to their supervisor, the Office of Inspector General, or theDesignated Agency Ethics Official. Reports to the Office of Inspector Generalmay be made through its ``hot-line.'' The major changes in these regulations are: andbullet; The sections are reworded and their ordering rearranged to simplifyand clarify the existing regulations. The regulations delete provisionsthat provided specific examples or merely paraphrased statutory requirements.andbullet; The definition of ``employee'' is revised to include members offederal advisory committees, consistent with existing practice and interpretation,and to include ``special Government employees,'' rather than having a separatesubpart devoted only to these employees. andbullet; Provision for acceptance of reimbursable travel for an employeeis made in the section on ``Gifts, entertainment, and favors.'' andbullet; The provisions on outside employment have been simplified. andbullet; New provisions require employees to comply with Department proceduresconcerning release of official information to the press, Congress, or thepublic. andbullet; A new section on conduct relating to drugs has been added as partof the Department's program to achieve a drug-free workplace, in accordancewith Executive Order 12564. <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking procedure </ITAG>Since these regulations relate to agency management and personnel, theyare exempt from notice and comment requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(a).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.
