(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fire at a high-tech company sent anorange-brown cloud of poisonous gas mushrooming into the sky,forcing an evacuation and sending 19 people to hospitals.   Those taken to three hospitals from Tuesday's accident atAdvanced Dielectrics Inc. complained of burning lungs and skin andshortness of breath. Hospital officials said no one was seriouslyinjured and most were released Tuesday night.   More than 500 workers were evacuated from nearby businesses whena dried resin containing the chemical bromine ignited in aventilation pipe and produced highly toxic hydrogen bromide gas,officials said. The smoke from the fire contained nitrogen cyanide,bromide, and carbon monoxide, officials said.   ``You just go down your bad-news list and you'll find all thesesubstances there,'' said Inspector Larry Stephenson. ``Thematerials can be deadly, depending on the combination of gases.''   Advanced Dielectrics manufactures electronic circuit boards. Thefire was the second in as many days at a high-tech firm in Fremont,which is about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.   A blaze on Monday at Trend Circuits Co. sent 13 employees of aneighboring firm to the hospital when a solvent combined withhydrogen peroxide and ignited.
