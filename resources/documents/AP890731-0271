Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., a consortium of the North Slopeoil producers, said Monday that some of the production slippage of100,000 barrels a day this year is attributable to the spill by theExxon Valdez.   ``The oil spill accounted for about 12 million barrels of lostopportunity, reducing the average by 32,000 barrels a day,'' saidAlyeska spokesman Tom Brennan. ``But 60,000 barrels was due tofield production decline and producer maintenance.''   The average daily flow through the pipeline is expected to dropanother 75,000 barrels next year.   Prudhoe Bay accounts for three-quarters of the production on theNorth Slope, which provides about one-fourth of the nation'sdomestic oil supply.   Brennan said the average daily flow in the pipeline is expectedto drop from 2 million barrels to 1.9 million this year and to 1.83million in 1990.   The Prudhoe Bay field, the largest in the United States, beganproducing in 1977.   Chuck Logsdon, the state's chief petroleum economist, said thatmore than half of the estimated 10 billion barrels in the reservoirhave been drained. He said production is expected to drop 12percent to 15 percent a year.   Logsdon said none of the other producing fields on the NorthSlope is large enough to compensate for the Prudhoe Bay falloff.   The production decline will cost the state of Alaska $175million in lost taxes and royalties over the next two years,Logsdon says. The state gets about 85 percent of its revenue fromoil.</TEXT></DOC>
