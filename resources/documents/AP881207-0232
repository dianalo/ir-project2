North onWednesday dropped efforts to disclose a quarter of the 40,000 pagesof classified documents he wants to use to defend criminal chargesarising from the Iran-Contra affair.   Defense lawyers filed a brief statement that they werewithdrawing 10,000 pages of CIA intelligence cables on Nicaraguathat were listed in North's Nov. 14 notice of government secrets hewants to reveal in a public trial.   The monthly intelligence cables covered a three-year period fromJanuary 1984 through December 1986, a month after the Iran-Contraaffair became known and North was dismissed from his job at theNational Security Council.   In a motion last month, Iran-Contra special prosecutor LawrenceE. Walsh sought to bar the defense from using any secret documentsas evidence. Walsh accused the defense of listing a large number ofirrelevant documents ``to overwhelm the court's and the government'sabilities to conduct proceedings'' under the Classified InformationProcedures Act.   He specifically criticized North's listing of ``large swatches ofCIA cables concerning Nicaragua that bear only the most tangentialrelation to the subject matter of the case.''   North's statement was filed as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell continued closed hearings into the use of secret documents attrial. The hearings began last week.   Gesell has not ruled on secrecy issues and must decide ifclassified material North wants to disclose is needed for hisdefense. President Reagan said last week he would allow virtuallynone of the documents to be disclosed in open court.   If Gesell decides North cannot get a fair trial wthout disclosingsome documents, he could dismiss the central charge that the formerpresidential aide conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-saleproceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels.   To foreclose North's need to disclose government secrets, Walshhas narrowed the focus of allegations against the formerpresidential aide.   On Tuesday, he filed a detailed statement of North's ``whollylegitimate'' efforts to try to release American hostages in theMiddle East.   The summary of North's activities was offered as an unclassifiedstatement that could be introduced as evidence at trial.   The Reagan administration, seeking to protect well-guardedsecrets about intelligence operations, is particularly sensitiveabout revealing any details about efforts to free the hostages.   Walsh argues that North and his co-defendants corrupted PresidentReagan's arms-for-hostage initiatives by diverting proceeds to theNicaraguan rebels.   No date has been set for North's trial. Separate trials have beenordered for former national security adviser John M. Poindexter andarms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord.</TEXT></DOC>
