Beginning this month, OPEC governments have offered extra priceconcessions to customers and moved to undercut non-cartelcompetitors, including Mexico, the government oil monopoly Pemexsaid Friday.   Coupled with overproduction, the concessions ``have initiated anundeclared, intense competition in prices among countries in thePersian Gulf that decided to maintain or increase their marketparticipation, searching for new clients and seeking to displaceestablished commercial flows,'' Pemex said in a statement.   Pemex on Friday announced price reductions for the United Statesand said Saudi Arabia had displaced Mexico, Canada and Venezuela asthe United States' No. 1 oil supplier.   It said production by the 13-member Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries surpassed 20 billion barrels per day in Augustand September and blamed aggressive competition between OPECmembers for forcing the average price of Mexican crude on spotmarkets to about $9 a barrel.   The monopoly said as a result of the changing marketplace forcrude that it will earn less this year than the $7.9 billiongenerated by oil exports in 1987.   But Pemex said Friday that it will not increase its exports tocompensate for lost earnings and risk aggravating an alreadyvolatile market.   ``Mexico is ready to (hold a) dialogue both with OPEC members aswell as independent exporters with the objective of achievingreasonable and stable prices for petroleum,'' the statement said.   The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted an official withthe Energy, Mines and State-Owned Industries Department as sayingMexico had lost $2 billion in anticipated revenues so far in 1988because of depressed market prices. The department oversees Pemex'soperations.   Foreign exchange revenues generated by oil exports are essentialto Mexico's efforts to service its $104 billion foreign debt,second largest in the developing world behind Brazil.   Mexico is the world's sixth-largest oil producer.</TEXT></DOC>
