A monitoring system combining surface measurementof diaphragm EMG activity and transcutaneous measurement of blood gaseswould provide the intensive care physician with non-intrusively obtainedinformation on (a) the central patterning of respiratory neural output,(b) the state and effectiveness of the respiratory pump, and (c) thechemical drive and the adequacy of oxygenation. Rational and timely provision,alteration and withdrawal of ventilatory assistance would be promotedby such monitoring.</TEXT></DOC>
