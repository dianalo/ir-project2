Accordingly, on May 26, 1989, the USTR identified as a ``prioritypractice'' the ban on government procurement of foreign satellites maintainedby the Government of Japan (54 FR 24438). As part of a ``long range visionon space development'' Japan prohibits the procurement of foreign satellitesby government entities if such a purchase interferes with ``indigenousdevelopment objectives.'' Japan's policy of promoting indigenous productioncapability by prohibiting government procurement of foreign satellitesapplies to the entire range of satellites (broadcast, communications, earthresource, weather). The United States has long been the world leader insatellite production, and is thus denied significant market opportunitiesby this policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Investigation </ITAG>Section 310(b) of the Trade Act requires the USTR to initiate an investigation,pursuant to section 302(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, of this ``priority practice'',in order to determine whether it is actionable under section 301 of theTrade Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment </ITAG>The public is invited to comment on the policies and practices of the governmentof Japan that are the subject of this investigation, including (1) whetherJapan's ban on government procurement of foreign satellites is actionableunder section 301; and (2) the amount of the burden or restriction on U.S.commerce caused by these policies and practices.
