<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-0633 </DOCNO><TEXT>A search for emission from Hercules X-1 at energies above 50 TeV duringthe calendar period April 1986 to July 1987 yielded two significant bursts,on UT 24 July 1986. The events during these bursts were pulsed with aperiod of 1.2357 s, significantly different from estimates of the contemporaneousx-ray period. The probability that this represents random statisticalfluctuations of the background is estimated to be 1/70000. The muon contentof the burst events is anomalous when compared with expectations fromgamma-ray showers. 11 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
