By backing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who invaded KuwaitAug. 2, Arafat cut off an important source of revenue, the oilsheiks of the Persian Gulf.   He also harmed relations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,the leading Arab moderate who had championed Arafat's peaceinitiative.   Whether these developments will jeopardize his leadership of thePalestine Liberation Organization remains to be seen.   Arafat has survived many challenges since he took over themovement in 1969. But with the PLO now threatened with a new schismas well as a funding squeeze, he is in a tight corner.   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinianscheer Saddam, not Arafat, in daily demonstrations against theAmericans and Saudis.   Arafat faces a growing challenge in the territories, where aPalestinian uprising has raged for 2{ years, from militants of theIslamic Hamas movement.   Hamas wants to escalate the stone-throwing riots against theIsraelis into a full-blown guerrilla war. The passions unleashed bySaddam's actions work in their favor.   They see Saddam's military might and willingness to challengethe West and Israel as their best hope of liberating the occupiedlands after decades of despair and humiliation.   In Syria, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine andthe Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine have calledfor a resumption of the armed campaign against Israel that washalted by the peace initiative Arafat launched in late 1988.   They are the largest guerrilla factions in the PLO afterArafat's Fatah group.   In Baghdad, the Palestine Liberation Front last week called on``progressive Arab forces to confront the invading Americanaggressors.''   The group is led by Mohammed Abbas, or Abul Abbas, themastermind of the Achille Lauro cruise liner hijack in October1985, and the failed seaborne attack on Israel that led PresidentBush earlier this year to break off the U.S. dialogue with the PLO.   Arab newspapers have reported that terrorist mastermind AbuNidal plans to base himself in Iraq after a split with Libya, wherehe has had his headquarters for the last few years.   But PLO officials interviewed in Tunis by telephone said theydid not believe that Saddam would welcome Abu Nidal, who was basedin Baghdad for seven years in the 1970s.   Few Palestinians were dismayed when Saddam invaded Kuwait andtouched off a potentially explosive confrontation with the theUnited States. They were increasingly frustrated by the Arabrulers' reluctance to use their oil wealth to force Israel to leavethe occupied territories.   Saddam played the Palestinian card shrewdly by linking anysettlement of the Persian Gulf crisis to an Israeli withdrawal fromthe West Bank and Gaza, captured in 1967.   He appealed to the Arab masses, over the heads of theirgovernments, for support for his stand against Israel and theUnited States.   He has succeeded to a large degree. Most Arabs see Washington asIsrael's main protector and have long fumed at its failure topressure the Jewish state into peace negotiations and a withdrawalfrom the occupied lands.   The PLO was reluctant at first to back Saddam. Arafat shuttledbetween Arab capitals trying to find an ``Arab solution'' thatwould prevent foreign intervention. But ``he found the leaders fartoo divided to cooperate,'' said a PLO official who accompanied him.   In recent days, PLO officials have been trying to put a betterpublic face on their position.   ``The PLO will never condone the occupation of any country byforce when we ourselves are victims of such policies,'' said SalahKhalaf, Arafat's senior aide who uses the nom de guerre of Abu Iyad.   But in an interview, he stressed Palestinian resentment at U.S.failure to force Israel to surrender the occupied territories aftermore than two decades. By contrast, he said, when Iraq seizedKuwait and the oil flow to the West was threatened, the UnitedStates and its allies acted ``like lightning.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Mona Ziade, based in Nicosia, has coveredPalestinian affairs for The Associated Press since 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
