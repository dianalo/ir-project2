(Advo) and made the subject of initialcomments by our July 17, 1989, notice in this docket. We asked commentersto concentrate on the legal feasibility of Advo's proposal that we establishone or more sets of procedures to consider contract rates, though theywere also free to state preliminary views on other relevant matters. Twelveparticipants \1\<NOTE/> filed comments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Advo, American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA),Association of Business Publishers (ABP), Coalition of Non-Postal Media(CNPM), Dow Jones andamp; Company (DJ), Magazine Publishers Association (MPA),National Newspaper Association (NNA), the Commission's Office of the ConsumerAdvocate (OCA), Third Class Mail Association (TCMA), United Parcel Service(UPS), the Postal Service, and Warshawsky andamp; Company.While analysis of the postal ratemaking statute, aided by the commentsfiled in this docket, shows that new procedural rules for considerationof contract rates_as Advo's petition uses that term_would serve no practicalpurpose, the petition does raise important questions about how postal servicesare defined and priced. We are therefore maintaining this docket in existence,but redirecting it toward exploration of mechanisms that might secure theadvantages Advo claims for the contract rates described in its petition,without contravening the Postal Reorganization Act. In this Order we (i)describe Advo's two alternative proposals; (ii) explain our conclusionthat they are, respectively, inconsistent with the Act and in practiceduplicative of existing mechanisms; and finally (iii) describe and explainthe direction we find most profitable for further inquiry.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Advo Proposals </ITAG>Advo describes two different forms of contract rate it believes the Commissionshould consider:1. The Commission might, after considering cost and other relevant evidence,establish a range of permissible rates for particular subclasses; the PostalService and individual mailers would be free to negotiate rates withinthis range.2. The Postal Service and one or more mailers would negotiate a rate andservice package which would then (i) be submitted to the Commission forreview, and (ii) thereafter be available on the same terms to all potentialusers.Apart from the general question whether the Act contemplates or permitscontract rates in any form, the commenters most often dealt with Advo'stwo alternatives separately.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contract Rates Under the Act </ITAG>The most obvious question is whether the Act permits (any form of) contractrates. Advo argues that it does, with varying degrees of support from DJ,MPA, and the Postal Service; others argue that it does not.Advo's main arguments are that the Act does not in terms forbid negotiatedrates; and that since the Act generally aimed at reform and streamliningof the postal system, such negotiation is at least consistent with theoverall statutory purpose. Advo concedes that the Act does not specificallypermit negotiated rates and that they were not employed either before orsince its passage. However, it argues that the contracting power grantedthe Service [39 U.S.C. section 401(3)] is not elsewhere limited by theAct and is broad enough to encompass ratemaking by contract. Moreover,it contends that neither of its proposals would bypass the procedures of39 U.S.C. ch. 36, since both involve Postal Rate Commission review of thenegotiated rates. With certain qualifications, including the importantcaveat that cost avoidance would be the principal rationale for any contractrate lower than the rate charged the subclass generally, MPA supports thisreasoning.Opposition to Advo's position takes a number of forms. Some commentersargue that it would effectively bypass the present, mandatory ch. 36 procedures.ABP, for instance, argues that public hearings are mandatory in the developmentof rates, and that the proposals delegate to private parties the initiative,properly the Service's alone, under section 3622(a), to launch rate changes.CNPM, NNA, and UPS also argue that the proposals improperly limit the Commission'srole. The OCA points out that unilateral rate-changing authority is grantedonly by sections 3627 (failure of appropriations for revenue forgone) and3641 (failure to complete rate case in 10 months), and that the PostalService's contracting power furnishes no counterargument since the Governorsare a necessary participant in lawful ch. 36 rate changes. ANPA and UPSmake the point that section 3622 contemplates ratemaking by class and subclassof mail \2\<NOTE/> and that rates for individual customers conflict with thisstructure. TCMA questions whether recommending a range of rates would dischargeour duty to make a recommendation on specific rate changes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Subsections (b) (2), (3), and (7) specifically refer tothese classificational units.Besides suggesting that contract rates would violate procedural requirements,some comments question whether such rates would not in principle violatesubstantive ratemaking standards_not just the criteria of section 3622(b)but also general policy rules in ch. 1 of the Act and, particularly, section403(c) forbidding undue or unreasonable discrimination or preference.\3\<NOTE/> Thus even if it were established that Advo's proposals forCommission involvement in contractual ratemaking satisfied the proceduralrequirements of ch. 36, some issues would remain as to whether any contractrate, simply by virtue of being a contract rate, would under the statutebe impossible for the Commission to approve.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Even if it were assumed, arguendo, that contract ratescould lawfully be established without observance of ch. 36 requirements,they would still be subject to these provisions, which apply directly tothe Postal Service as well as to the Commission's ratemaking process.Of particular importance here are suggestions that because the Act callsfor classification of mail, and for fixing of rates by classes, there issimply no place for exceptional ``non-class'' rates established by contract.ANPA observes that of two identically-situated mailers one might succeedin negotiating a lower rate than the other, and that if this possibilityis accepted it is evident that relative skill or opportunity in negotiationcan be the only source of the difference. As ANPA argues, this is not arecognized criterion under the Act. UPS takes a similar position, and citescase law and legislative history for the proposition that_<ITAG tagnum="21">Congress recognized that the political pressures exerted on postaleconomics caused the widespread public impression that the influence ofspecial interests had a determining effect on the structure of postal rates* * * * To permit large mailers to negotiate special contractual dealswould only resurrect and reinforce that impression.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Advo proposes to inject into the ratemaking process the very sameinfluences that the Act was intended to eradicate. * * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">UPS Initial Comments at 9. The OCA makes similar arguments.These arguments from overall statutory purpose are particularly interestingbecause, in large measure, we are asked to draw inferences from the silenceof the statute rather than from its positive language. Advo's argument,somewhat simplified, is: Contract rates are a recognized pricing techniquegenerally; the Act does not specifically forbid them in postal pricing;therefore the Commission may entertain them. Arguments of this type areundercut, however, if there is reason to think that the overall purposeof the statute (which may fail to forbid them specifically only because,as Advo recognizes, they were not in use in 1970) would be disserved bythe suggested new mechanism.We need not rest our determination wholly on an attempt to settle thisbroad question, because we are not in the situation of, e.g., a court facedwith an actual attempt by the Postal Service and a mailer to negotiatea non-tariff rate. The question before us is the more modest one whethera new set of procedures allowing for such rates would be likely to serveany useful purpose.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Basic Structure of Ratemaking Under the Act.</ITAG>Some of the dispute outlined above may be resolved, so far as it need befor our purposes, by examining more closely the fundamental structure ofratemaking under the Act. One foundation of Advo's argument for the lawfulnessof contract ratemaking is that the Commission would continue to reviewthe rates in question. This raises the issue, on which neither Advo normost other commenters focus, of whether the Commission's function is to``review'' rates or, with the final concurrence of the Governors, to ``make''rates in some more fundamental sense.It is quite true that the Commission does not, sua sponte, initiate ratechange proceedings; that power belongs to the Postal Service under section3622(a).\4\<NOTE/> Likewise, it is customary_though, significantly, not mandatory\5\<NOTE/>_for the Service to include specific proposals for new ratesin its section 3622 filings. In other respects, however, the structureof the Act suggests that the Commission was thought of as more than a merereviewer of Postal Service proposals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Section 3662 provides that interested parties may filecomplaint cases alleging illegality of a rate currently charged, and thatsuch cases lead to issuance of a recommended decision under andSection;andSection;3624-3625.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Section 3622(a) reads: ``From time to time the PostalService shall request the Postal Rate Commission to submit a recommendeddecision on changes in a rate or rates of postage or in a fee or fees forpostal services if the Postal Service determines that such changes wouldbe in the public interest and in accordance with the policies of this title.<T3>The Postal Service may submit such suggestions for rate adjustmentsas it deems suitable.''</T3> [Emphasis added.]First, the Act_despite plenty of precedent in other ratemaking statutes_didnot provide a mechanism whereby the Commission could allow a rate changeto go into effect without review proceedings. Rates can be changed onlyfollowing a recommended decision by the Commission and its acceptance bythe Governors.\6\<NOTE/> In ratemaking statutes where the underlying assumption isthat the agency <T3>reviews</T3> rates established in the first instance by the regulatedfirm\7\<NOTE/>, it has been common to provide that the rates become effectiveat some fixed time after being filed with the agency, unless the agencysuspends them and schedules hearings. Our statute takes the opposite approach:in a normal case \8\<NOTE/> there can be no rate change until the Commission has heldhearings (or accepted a settlement) and issued a decision, and the Governorshave registered their approval. The natural inference is that the ch. 36process itself generates the rate change, and is not provided simply toreview an otherwise independently effective rate change by the Postal Service.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ This point must be distinguished from the question whetherthe Commission can make a recommended decision without <T3>hearings.</T3> Section 3624(b)(5) makes it clear that, if all partiesagree, it may.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This distinction emerged in some detail in <T3>United Gas Pipe Line Co.</T3> v. <T3>Mobile Gas Service Corp.,</T3> 350 U.S. 332 (1956), interpreting theNatural Gas Act. The Federal Power Act is structurally similar. The OCA(Comments at 10) raises the question whether, under <T3>Mobile</T3> and its companion case [<T3>FPC</T3> v. <T3>Sierra Pacific Power Co.,</T3> 350 U.S. 348 (1956)], the Service mightbind itself by long-term fixed-rate contracts, so that some mailers couldescape the next general increase effectuated under andSection; 3622. Thecases perhaps do raise that question_but only if we assume that the Servicehas the kind of inherent unilateral price-setting power that was attributedto gas pipelines and electric utilities by the <T3>Mobile</T3> and <T3>Sierra</T3> decisions. If it does not, then it is hard to see how itcould by contract insulate selected mailers from the effects of a generalincrease. We think the ratemaking statute establishes that no such powerexists, and so we do not consider further the objection based on the <T3>Mobile-Sierra</T3> doctrine.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ That is, one where the 10-month deadline of andSection;3624(c)(1) is met.Moreover, the courts have treated the Commission as the agency principallyresponsible for cost allocation and rate design decisions. <T3>National Association of Greeting Card Publishers</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service,</T3> 462 U.S. 810, 821 (1983); <T3>Time, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service,</T3> 685 F.2d 760, 771 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>National Association of Greeting Card Publishers</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service,</T3> 607 F.2d 392, 401 (D.C. Cir. 1979), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 444 U.S. 1025 (1980). None of these decisions, ofcourse, considered the precise question now before us; but they counselcaution in accepting the proposition that review of a negotiated rate agreement,which may not rest on a fully articulated cost analysis, or indeed on anyanalysis at all,\9\<NOTE/> would fulfill the Commission's statutory function. Certainother practical questions are glossed over by generalized references tothe Commission's ``reviewing'' negotiated rate and service arrangements.Advo does not discuss whether, and to what extent, its proposal would permitthe Commission to modify the negotiated arrangement submitted to it for``review.'' That this is by no means an imaginary problem is clear fromthe settlement agreements submitted in some ch. 36 cases \10\<NOTE/>: they commonly recite that the agreed-upon disposition mustbe accepted as a whole and not modified, or the agreement ceases to exist.If Advo's intent is that the Commission simply vote ``yea'' or ``nay''on a submitted agreement, it seems clear that the ``review'' contemplatedby its proposal amounts to considerably less than that exercised in a normalch. 36 proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ It is not uncommon under some regulatory schemes for rate-casesettlement agreements to declare explicitly that the rate agreed on is<T3>not</T3> supported by any particular analytical method but representsa simple ``dollar settlement.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Settlements of cases in which supporting materials havebeen filed by the Service, and opportunity for hearings on the record affordedby the Commission, as the statute requires, are not unknown. In those cases,if the settlement is unanimous, it can be recommended to the Governorssimply because all the supporting facts of record are undisputed. If itis not unanimous, the Commission may not recommend it <T3>as a settlement,</T3> though we may still recommend it as a controverteddisposition on the merits. <T3>Pennsylvania Gas andamp; Water Co.</T3> v. <T3>FPC,</T3> 463 F.2d 1242 (D.C. Cir. 1972); <T3>Michigan Consolidated Gas Co.</T3> v. <T3>FPC,</T3> 283 F.2d 204 (D.C. Cir.), <T3>cert. denied sub nom. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co.</T3> v. <T3>Michigan Consolidated Gas Co.,</T3> 364 U.S. 913 (1960). This is tobe distinguished from the possibility implicit in Advo's proposal: thata change in rates might be <T3>initially submitted</T3> without enough supporting material to permitproper Commission analysis.Another area of doubt arises from the statutory directive that in recommendingrates we consider the interests of competitors [section 3622(b)(4), (5)].The Supreme Court has made it clear that we are to carry out this mandatewhen we assign institutional cost responsibility to the classes of mail.<T3>National Association of Greeting Card Publishers</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Postal Service,</T3> 462 U.S. 810, 829, fn. 24 (1983). We canpresume that a competitor of the Postal Service will not be party to contract-ratenegotiations between the Service and a mailer. Since the competitor's legalinterest in the resulting rate entails adequately knowing the contractmailer's attributable cost, so that the implicit institutional-cost contributioncan be tested against the statute, there is additional cause for concernabout the possibility of inadequately-documented contract rate filings.As a result, there is substantial uncertainty as to whether the Commissionreview supposedly preserved in the Advo proposals in fact corresponds towhat Congress expected of us. It will therefore be particularly importantto see if the advantages Advo points to (assuming for the moment that theydo exist) in fact distinguish its proposal from a more conventional reviewmechanism.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Discrimination Problem</ITAG>As noted above, andSection; 403(c) forbids undue or unreasonable discriminationor preferences. While the potential interaction of this provision and thesuggestions made by Advo could be stated in a number of ways, we thinkit adequate to reduce it to two questions:1. Does any contract rate system whatever violate andSection; 403(c), simplyby virtue of being a contract rate system?2. Even if 1. is answered ``no,'' do (various kinds of) contract rate mechanismspresent such a substantial opportunity for improperly discriminatory orpreferential arrangements as to be, themselves, undesirable?MPA makes the useful point that one would expect cost savings to be thebasis for any contractual arrangement providing a rate lower than thatcharged the subclass generally. In ratemaking terms, this amounts to sayingthat if a particular mailer imposes attributable costs that are less thanthose for the subclass as a whole, a corresponding contractual reductionin its rate might be appropriate. We may accept for argument's sake thatsuch a reduction, assuming it to be otherwise lawful, would not constituteundue or unreasonable discrimination. That failing is customarily definedas a difference in price for substantially similar service, rendered contemporaneously,under substantially similar conditions. If the mailer shows that the conditionsunder which a service is rendered to it are materially less onerous andcostly than is usual in the relevant subclass, one of the conditions forundue discrimination is not met.This formulation implies that negotiated differences in contribution toinstitutional cost would not escape section 403(c). A single-customer pricereduction based on cost-of-service differences is theoretically justifiableeven where price discrimination in general is most strongly condemned.\11\<NOTE/> However, it is not so clear that accepting a lower rate ofreturn from one customer than is demanded from another, similar customercomports with antidiscrimination provisions like section 403(c). It hassometimes been approved:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. 13(a), allows fora cost-justification defense of otherwise prohibited price discrimination:`` . . . nothing herein contained shall prevent differentials which makeonly due allowance for differences in the cost of manufacture, sale, ordelivery resulting from the differing methods or quantities in which suchcommodities are to such purchasers sold or delivered[.]''<ITAG tagnum="21">Manifestly, the loss of Cooperative Customers [who were capable ofgenerating electricity for themselves], which account for over 90% of Delmarva'sannual revenues from wholesale sales, could have a crippling effect onDelmarva's ability to supply electrical energy to its Tariff Customersat rates which the Tariff Customers could afford to pay. Under such circumstances,<T3>where the initiation of rates is vested in the utility, subject toa determination by the Federal Power Commission that the rates are justand reasonable, and are not unduly discriminatory, </T3>Delmarva had theright to elect not to earn a rate of return which the Commission foundfair, but which would have the potential effect of destroying its majorwholesale market. By the same token, this evidence fully justified theCommission in deciding that the rate charged the Cooperative Customers,though . . . one which earned a lesser rate of return than that earnedon sales to Tariff Customers, was not <T3>unduly</T3> discriminatory. . . .</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>St. Michaels Utilities Commission</T3> v. <T3>Federal Power Commission,</T3> 377 F.2d 912, 917 (4th Cir. 1967) (italicsadded). The considerations that led this court to sanction a differenceas ``not <T3>unduly</T3> discriminatory'' were thus that_as noted above_the FPC'srole was not to generate just and reasonable rates through its own proceedings,but rather to test those filed by jurisdictional utilities against thestatutory standard; and that the utility acted reasonably in acceptinga diminished return for shareholders rather than risk losing valuable customersaltogether. Neither of these considerations is present in our case. Wehave explained our conclusion that the Commission's ratemaking role isdifferent in kind from the FPC's. And the rate of return at issue in <T3>St. Michaels</T3> is not analogous to institutional cost contributionin postal ratemaking,\12\<NOTE/> even though a species of value-of-service \13\<NOTE/> consideration played a role in the utility's opting for alowered return.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ While reasonable return on equity can be thought of asan economic cost, it is not, in the traditional utility ratemaking techniquesunderlying <T3>St. Michaels</T3>, part of the total cost of service, which was fullyallocated to customer classes. (As interest on a utility's debt must bepaid, at a fixed rate, it can be treated as at least analogous to sucha cost.) By contrast, the Postal Service's total revenues must equal totalaccrued costs. Its institutional costs are not analogous, in this respect,to a return on equity but are simply the theoretically or in some casesempirically unallocable portion of accrued costs_all of which must be paid.Hence the Governors have no latitude to decide to forgo recovering someof them.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>Cf. </T3>39 U.S.C. 3622(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">The Relevance of Ratemaking for Classes</ITAG>In this respect, it is of great significance that_as some commenters havenoted_the Act speaks in terms of institutional cost contribution by classesof mail and types of mail service. 39 U.S.C. 3622(b)(3). This may of coursebe interpreted in more than one way. In what follows, we discuss theseinterpretations in some detail. While the discussion may appear academic,it is of considerable practical importance in elucidating the underlyingstructure of postal ratemaking and demonstrating the degree to which ratesthat really depend on negotiation are foreign to it.First, the mandate of section 3622(b)(3) could be read to mean that onthe average a subclass is to produce the contribution to attributable costthat the Commission factors into the rates later established by the Governors.So interpreted (and considered in isolation) this requirement is not necessarilyviolated by charging different rates_as long as the (presumably lower)contract rates do not bring the class-wide institutional cost contributionbelow the established level. Such a deficiency would in turn be avoidedif (i) the contractually-based reductions strictly reflected attributable-costdifferences and nothing else, and the corresponding, unchanged institutional-costcontribution were stated on a per-piece basis; \14\<NOTE/> or (ii) the class-wide rate were set using an inflated institutional-costcontribution (markup) to allow for a reasonably-estimated loss of suchcontribution through subsequent contract-rate arrangements. The secondalternative would clearly raise serious questions of undue discrimination,in that the tariff customer would effectively be taxed, in advance, forthe benefit of the customer able to negotiate a favorable contract.\15\<NOTE/> We believe it is simply outside the range of ratemaking practicality.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Clearly, reducing the attributable-cost basis in thecase of a particular mailer, and then applying to the reduced basis thesame percentage markup as applied for the class-wide ratemaking computation,would lead to a shortfall in the class's institutional cost contribution.Percentage markups as used in andSection; 3622 proceedings effectively presupposea uniform attributable cost for every piece in the subclass. We can ofcourse derive a percentage markup arithmetically by dividing the aggregateattributable cost into the class's revenue target. However, we cannot thenget back to that revenue target by performing a series of computationswherein the individual attributable costs of less-than-average-cost piecesare multiplied by the markup to obtain an individual-piece revenue. Atthe purely theoretical level, we might do so (if volume effects are neglected)by performing such a computation for every piece rather than just thosewith lower-than-average attributable cost. But this would presuppose mailersprepared to contract with the Service for a rate higher than the one theschedule offers on the basis of intraclass cost averaging. The commentsin this docket do not support this as a practical possibility. Accordingly,we think it more realistic, as well as more economical, to regard percentagemarkups as essential presupposing cost averaging within the relevant subclass.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ In addition, estimating the amount of ``cushion'' neededto be reasonably sure that the whole subclass would recover its designedinstitutional-cost contribution might well be infeasible.The alternative reading of section 3622(b)(3) would make each piece ina given subclass responsible for making the same contribution to institutionalcosts. This interpretation in effect presupposes the averaging of costper piece by virtue of the inclusion of all relevant pieces in the samesubclass. Once that averaging is accepted, and the average cost per piecemade part of the operational description of the subclass, further pricingcomputations are relatively plain sailing. By definition, all pieces inthe subclass are deemed to have the same attributable cost \16\<NOTE/>; the per-piece contribution (again, equal for each piece)can be expressed indifferently by a cents-per-piece add-on or a percentagemarkup. <T3>See</T3> fn. 14, above. It is evident that this reading of section3622(b)(3) is, by virtue of these presupposed equalities, quite inconsistentwith a mechanism for varying rates within the subclass by contract.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ For simplicity, we are here postulating a subclass withno more than a single base rate and with no worksharing discounts. Addingthese features would merely complicate the reasoning without changing itsessence.It may be objected that the reading last explained is unrealistic and thuswrong, since ``everybody knows'' that not every piece in a subclass coststhe same to handle. But to argue thus simply amounts to pointing out thatuniformity of attributable cost is being imposed as a methodological rule,rather than presented as an empirical result. We postulate uniform costnot because our cost measurements are defective but simply because discreterates based on individual attributable costs for each piece of mail area patent impossibility. Hence we must, under section 3622(b)(3) as wellas section 3623, price postal services by classes. As in any system ofregulated prices where classes of service are defined, the question isnot so much ``Are all the sales in a class uniform with respect to costof service?'' (to which the answer will generally be ``no'') as ``Are theclasses so drawn as to cover no unjustifiably large variations in costof service between one sale and another?'' \17\<NOTE/>. Especially where individual transactions run into the billions,as with the Postal Service,\18\<NOTE/> it seems pointless to hope for a manageable) classificationsystem that would produce cost uniformity in fact.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ There are, of course, numerous other criteria to be observedin setting up class boundaries. We have discussed them in some detail_mostrecently in Docket R87-1, in connection with the proposal for a bulk third-classcarrier route subclass.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ In distinguishing Federal Power Commission regulationof gas pipelines from other forms of ratemaking, the Supreme Court observedthat ``. . . the [Natural Gas] Act is in marked contrast to the InterstateCommerce Act, which in effect precludes private rate agreements by itsrequirement that the rates to all shippers be uniform, a requirement whichmade unnecessary any provision for filing contracts [with the ICC] . .. . The vast number of retail transactions of railroads made policing ofindividual transactions administratively impossible; effective regulationcould be accomplished only by requiring compliance with a single scheduleof rates applicable to all shippers. On the other hand, only a relativelyfew wholesale transactions are regulated by the Natural Gas Act and thesetypically require substantial investment in capacity and facilities forthe service of a particular distributor.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>United Gas Pipe Line Co. </T3>v. <T3>Mobile Gas Service Corp.,</T3> 350 U.S. 332, 338-339 (1956). It seemsclear that the Postal Service more closely resembles the railroads thanthe pipelines. As if in recognition of this circumstance, Congress instructedthe Commission that rates should exhibit ``simplicity of structure . .. and simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees chargedthe various classes of mail . . . .'' [andSection; 3622(b)(7)].Nor is it a useful answer to argue that we need only abandon percentagemarkup as a pricing device and substitute cents per piece. Cents-per-piecehas potential usefulness as a criterion of institutional-cost responsibility,most obviously for <T3>interclass</T3> comparisons. In the present analysis, making it theruling criterion within a subclass simply returns us to the first alternativeinterpretation: we have in effect decided to add a uniform contributionin cents to each individual attributable cost imposed by the successivepieces in the subclass, and total the results.This discussion implies, first, that any systematically authorized departuresfrom tariffed rates must be justified mathematically by cost savings.\1\\9\<NOTE/> If we read the statutory mandate that mail be classifiedand that each class produce an appropriate contribution to institutionalcosts as referring only to aggregate contribution, then the only way inwhich contract rates lower than the tariff rate could be accommodated withoutinviting unlawful discrimination is to restrict the departures from thetariff to demonstrated attributable-cost differences. On the other hand,if we read section 3622(b)(3) as requiring the same contribution from eachpiece in the subclass, then at least so long as we compute rates usingpercentage markups we have as an additional hurdle the postulate of (articificially)uniform attributable costs throughout the subclass.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ We note again, but without pursuing the point, thatthe comments do not consider the question whether, in a contract rate regime,the Postal Service would be authorized to refuse service at the tariffedrate on account of exceptionally <T3>high</T3> costs for a particular mailing, and instead propose to negotiatewith the mailer for an appropriate surcharge. <T3>See</T3> fn. 14, above.A second implication is that a good many of the arguments offered in favorof rate contracts may be satisfied by reforming mail classification ratherthan permitting outright exceptions to it.<ITAG tagnum="84">Is Advo's Second Proposal Really a Scheme for Mail ClassificationReform?</ITAG>Advo's second proposal is for negotiated rate and service arrangementsthat would (i) be filed with the Commission and, if approved, (ii) be availableon demand by any other user with qualifying mail. A number of commentershave questioned whether this amounts to more than a greatly ramified systemof mail classification, and if so whether the ``contract'' aspect of theproposal has any real meaning.Advo considers the distinction between the present classification systemand a system involving contract rates to be that the former allows onlywhat it calls ``unilateral contracts'': i.e., it is a regime in which thePostal Service must provide a service, defined in advance, at the statedprice to anyone tendering qualifying mail. Its own suggestions, it says,involve ``bilateral'' contracting. However, Advo's second proposal appearsto qualify this distinction in that a rate and service arrangement, oncesanctioned by the Commission, would be generally available on demand_i.e.,on the same ``unilateral contract'' basis as the present subclasses definedin the <T3>Domestic Mail Classification Schedule.</T3>We are persuaded that this circumstance substantially undercuts the argumentsin favor of substituting a contractual regime for the present system ofclassifications and fixed rates. That it has been seriously made, however,does suggest that the implementation of the present system may be insufficientlyflexible. TCMA argues that a certain amount of informal modification andadjustment of services is done even today, when there is no price differentialreflecting it.\2\\0\<NOTE/> When a particular modification_particularly in the form ofworksharing_becomes or is expected to become sufficiently widespread, wecreate a new classification (rate category) to reflect the savings. Butit is still broadly true that, even for classes where fairly elaborateoperations on the part of the mailer as well as the Postal Service arethe rule, the system assumes that subclasses are defined, ``end-to-end''services purchased as a unit by the mailer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ Of course in many instances none would be expected.We have frequently recommended classification provisions that define eligiblemail as being prepared or tendered as ``prescribed by the Postal Service''(<T3>see, e.g., DMCS 300.023</T3>). Since rates attach to classes, not topieces or mailings (<T3>see</T3> PRC Op. C85-1, paras. 024-025), one would not expect to seea price adjustment asked or offered where variations are called for incharacteristics the DMCS commits to Postal Service discretion.TCMA has suggested that this approach may be due for reconsideration. Withoutnecessarily endorsing the idea that classes of mail are merely collectionsof successive, or distinguishable, functional operations that could justas well be sold piecemeal, we recognize that both the willingness and thecapacity of mailers to perform some of these operations for themselveshas increased over the years.\2\\1\<NOTE/> It may therefore be time to consider whether the presumptionthat a subclass of mail is a unit, which may be sold at different pricesif there is enough evidence of worksharing arrangements yielding quantifiablesavings to the seller, should be reassessed by comparing it to a potentialalternative approach that (i) identifies manageable subunits, operationallydefined, and (ii) presumes that these subunits will be available separatelyat individually tariffed prices.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ For one thing, access to cheap computing power, a relativelyrecent phenomenon, has made the handling of great volumes of operationalinformation feasible for mailers or their service companies as well asfor the Service.<ITAG tagnum="84">Further Steps</ITAG>Accordingly, we have decided to request comments from those interested_whetheror not they have previously filed comments in this docket_on several broadissues:1. Would it be desirable to reorient mail classification to deemphasizethe unitary character of at least some classes or subclasses, and treatthem more as groupings of separable operational functions? What would bethe advantages of such a reorientation? Its disadvantages?2. To what extent, and for what reasons, would a reorientation as describedin (1)_a. Promote, or interfere with, the broad policies of the Postal ReorganizationAct?b. Be consistent, or inconsistent, with specific mandates of the Act?c. Assist, or interfere with, the regulatory program embodied in ch. 36of the Act?d. Affect nonpostal sectors of society or of the economy, in either beneficialor harmful ways?3. What, if any, alternative approaches (other than the contract rate mechanismsdiscussed in the petition and the initial comments) might be advantageouslyconsidered?4. Assuming arguendo that in an appreciable number of situations the reorientationdescribed above could be beneficial, is a <T3>general</T3> policy required? Or is the existing, case-by-case, mailclassification process adequate to the task?Of course, comments may address any other question or topic reasonablyrelated to the broad inquiry we have posed.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
