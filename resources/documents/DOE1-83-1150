The authors of this paper feel that costis probably the major reason and they point out that cost is greatlyimpacted by a failure to firmly establish, in an understandable manner,the role of the engineer in the assurance of quality. (In this paperthe authors are talking about engineers and engineering responsibility;they are not talking about engineering organizations.) This misunderstandingis associated with the unnecessarily legalistic interpretation of requirements.This has caused unwarranted cost overruns and schedule delays. The costand delays caused by the trivial concerns can be higher than Dollar 500million and two years delay for each nuclear power plant. The systemwhich caused the problem can, and must, be corrected. Engineers haveallowed the system to replace our technical skills and practical approachesto solving problems, and the engineers must now take the initiative andchange this system. The result will be better, more reliable and lesscostly products.</TEXT></DOC>
