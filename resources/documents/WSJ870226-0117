Under the contracts, Biogen will receive payments from Merck for achieving certain research goals in developing the protein, Mullerian Inhibiting Substance. If the protein eventually is approved for marketing as a drug, Biogen will manufacture it for Merck, which will sell it world-wide and pay royalties to Biogen. The amounts of research payments and potential royalties weren't disclosed.    The agreements, which will give Biogen a sorely needed new revenue source, boosted the company's stock 22%. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Biogen shares closed at $14.75, up $2.625.    Biogen, a development-stage biotechnology concern, reported a net loss of $20.5 million on revenue of $8.4 million for the 1986 nine months. One of the company's licensed products, alpha interferon, is a drug used to treat a rare form of cancer.    Mullerian Inhibiting Substance, or MIS, &quot;is an exciting product in theory,&quot; said Misha Petkevich, analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;This is the first deal Biogen has made for a while,&quot; she added.    Biogen scientists, in collaboration with Patricia Donahoe, a research physician at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, were the first to make a genetically engineered version of MIS last June. Analysts said Wall Street's reaction to the agreements was especially positive because they involved Rahway, N.J.-based Merck.    &quot;Merck is a top name in the drug industry, and it has been very selective in the biotechnology products it goes after,&quot; said Robert Kupor, analyst with Cable, Howse andamp; Ragen in Seattle.    Biogen also said it will continue working with Massachusetts General researchers to further develop the substance. The hospital is another &quot;blue-chip name,&quot; said Mr. Kupor.    MIS occurs naturally in male embryos and suppresses development of female reproductive organs. Scientists hope that its cell-inhibiting effects also will apply to the rapidly proliferating cells of ovarian, cervical and related cancers. &quot;If it works against cancer, it could have unusually low side effects because it is so specific for certain cells,&quot; Mr. Kupor said. </TEXT></DOC>
