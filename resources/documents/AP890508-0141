One man said he and his pickup apparently were sucked up insidea tornado and then dropped several hundred feet away.   ``I remember the truck lifting off the ground and I knew thatwas it, I was gone,'' said Detective Sgt. Larke Plyler, 31, of theUnion County Sheriff's Department. ``I have no idea how far up. Itwas jet black. And I don't know how high off the ground I was _ twofeet or 200 feet.''   He credited his seat belt with keeping him inside the truck asthe windows burst. ``I was just being thrown around. I was stillconscious, and I could see I was in the air,'' he said.   At first, Plyler said, the noise was extremely loud, but it grew``deathly quiet'' once he was inside the tornado's eye. ``Then itlaid me back down on Airport Road about 125 yards from where itfirst picked me up,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
