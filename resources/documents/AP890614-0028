(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This exclusive oceanfront communitydropped a plan to put surveillance cameras on four bridges into townafter the police chief said the crime-fighting idea was unworkable.   ``We can't continue to build fortresses and barriers aroundourselves,'' Police Chief Joseph Terlizzese said Tuesday, before theTown Council voted to abandon the idea. ``Next thing you know, we'llbe building machine-gun nests.''   In his report, Terlizzese said it was questionable whether thepictures would be good enough to identify drivers of vehicles.   Besides, Terlizzese said, crime in Palm Beach is not that bad.Last year, the city's crime rate dropped 12.5 percent, he said.   ``We're doing extremely well considering that some of our targetsare more attractive than those in neighboring communities _ withoutmentioning names,'' the police chief said.   Palm Beach, where developer Donald Trump and the Kennedy clanhave homes, lies across Lake Worth from West Palm Beach, whichincludes high-crime areas.   The cameras, which would cost between $250,000 and $500,000, weresuggested by a resident.</TEXT></DOC>
