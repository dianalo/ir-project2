But don't lose heart. You cannot afford to. You can say no totaxes, says Thomas Humbert, an economic scholar. He already has,loudly and succinctly.   Whether his message, delivered to the National EconomicCommission, has had much of an impact is difficult to say, but itshouldn't be forgotten, because months later his points remainmeaningful.   Humbert, a fellow in political economy at the HeritageFoundation, a conservative think tank that was influential in theReagan administration and still carries clout at the White House,lists seven reasons for saying no.   Tax increases, he says, hurt economic growth, undermine taxequity, lead to higher government spending, endanger internationalcompetitiveness and invite chaos in financial markets.   Moreover, he continues, the nation's budget deficit already isshrinking, and a balanced budget can still be achieved withoutraising taxes. In fact, he says, economic expansion is the only sureway to reduce the deficit.   But tax increases, he contends, have the opposite impact: Theylimit economic growth by undermining the climate for saving andinvesting.   ``Every tax drains money from the private marketplace togovernment programs,'' he points out. Taxes impose on the privatesector a complexity of regulations and paperwork. They drawsustenance from capital formation.   Seldom, he suggests, are taxes just. By his reckoning, themedian-income family of four did not pay a cent of income taxes in1948; now their tax bill is almost $2,700. Increases, he says, canonly mean that such families become more dependent on governmentservices, which of course are financed by taxes.   There is a pernicious aspect _ at least one _ to tax increases.The one chosen by Humbert is this: ``Increasing tax revenues relievethe pressure for budget cuts and usually result in higher spending.''   In defense of this claim, he cites as evidence a study conductedfor the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which estimated thatfor every dollar of tax increases in postwar America, spending wasraised by $1.52.   Besides, he continues, a tax increase now constitutes poortiming. A global economy is developing, and that means competitionfor markets among all industrial powers. High taxes, he suggests,could make us less competitive.   But, you may respond, we must close the gap between budgetexpenditures and revenues. Humbert's immediate response is that thegap already is growing smaller. But, important as it is, the gap maybe getting too much attention.   He suggests that our attention is similar to that of eyeing thehole rather than the doughnut. What's more important than thedeficit in any one year, he says, is the accumulation of debt.   In that regard, he calls attention to the fact that in 1946 thenational debt amounted to 120 percent of gross national product, andalmost 50 percent in 1959. Today, he says, the percentage is down to43, and falling.   Besides, he continues, a tax increase isn't needed to balance thebudget. In his view, a 4 percent growth in federal expenditures andcontinued economic expansion would bring the budget into balance by1993.   Finally, he contends that a tax increase would signal financialmarkets that American policy-makers were returning to the days ofthe 1970s when, Humbert asserts, ``capital formation and investmentwere almost destroyed by the twin forces of inflation andtax-induced stagnation.''   What is his recipe for success?   A big job: Sweeping back the tide and sending it the other waywith ``tax rate reductions that encourage risk-taking forentrepreneurs, small business people, and innovators _ the peoplewho generate the most jobs in our economy.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon, July 17</NOTE></DOC>
