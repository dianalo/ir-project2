Future demand for /sup 6/Li, whose main use will be asa tritium breeder in blankets surrounding the core of DT fusion powerreactors, is likely to exceed 5 Mg/a in the next century. The applicabilityof the various available methods to such a large scale production ratehas been assessed. Research on improving the effectiveness of currentlithium isotope separation processes has been carried out worldwide inseveral major areas during the past decade; these include two-phase chemicalexchange systems, ion exchange resin chromatography, highly isotope-selectivetechniques like laser photoactivation and radiofrequency spectroscopy.Chemical exchange systems appear to offer good potential in the nearterm for /sup 6/Li enrichment. 61 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
