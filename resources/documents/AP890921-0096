(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Hugo's leading edge broughtrain to the lower East Coast today, and thousands fled inland. Thefirst of 1,000 soldiers sent by President Bush arrived in the VirginIslands to quell looting in the storm's wake.   With landfall expected as early as tonight between Florida andNorth Carolina and the killer storm's winds rising to 110 mph,schools were closed, homes were boarded up, residents stocked up onemergency supplies and shelters opened.   Forecasters warned that waves could tower as much as 16 feetabove normal because the hurricane could cross the coast at hightide, about 2:30 a.m. Rain of 5 to 10 inches was forecast.   The military brought aircraft inland and sent ships out to sea toride out the storm, which has killed at least 25 people in theCaribbean with direct blows to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.   South Carolina's governor declared an emergency and called outthe National Guard to help thousands move inland. As many as 490,000people were being evacuated from the coast in Georgia, where anemergency also was declared.   ``We get a lot of storms over here. I don't get real upset overthem because I've sat through too many of them,'' said NancyTreadaway, who was packing this morning to leave Charleston.   Robin Bevill, taping the windows of her Wrightsville Beach, N.C.,gas station, said residents of the island town were nervous.   ``Diana, back in 1984, was nothing really to worry about,'' saidMs. Bevill. ``This one's expected to be bigger. ... It's stillexciting, as long as you're safe.''   U.S. military police were sent to the Virgin Islands to reinforceU.S. marshals, FBI agents and armed Coast Guardsmen who weredispatched after police reportedly joined prison escapees andmachete-armed mobs in looting on St. Croix.   The first contingent, about 75 soldiers led by a brigadiergeneral, arrived this morning, secured the airport and set up acommand center. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20years that a president ordered active duty military personnel intothe nation's streets.   ``Everyone in the federal pen there is loose,'' said Eileen Long,a New York City advertising executive who was among 145 St. Croixtourists who arrived in Miami late Wednesday on agovernment-arranged evacuation flight.   ``There are murderers and snipers running around everywhere,''she said.   Bush also declared the Virgin Islands a disaster area and freedup $500,000 for relief.   Hugo sideswiped the Bahamas and accelerated as it moved over openwater Wednesday. ``An increase in forward speed increases thelikelihood that it will strike the coast and not recurve, headingout to sea,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National HurricaneCenter in Florida.   Early today, rain from Hugo fell from North Carolina toMelbourne, Fla. Rain was heavy around Augusta, Ga. A hurricanewarning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Fla., to Cape Lookout, N.C.   Forecasters said there was a 1 in 4 chance that it would comeashore between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston.   Charleston officials braced for widespread flooding, noting thatsome streets flood at high tide during a full moon even without astorm. Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharged patients wellenough to go home and moved others inland. Utility companies saidthey would cut off power to Hilton Head Island.   At Cape Canaveral, Fla., NASA decided it was safe to keep shuttleAtlantis on the launch pad for an October launch.   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was 305 miles southeast of Savannah,or 29.5 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude. It wasmoving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph Wednesday.   Bill Clack, executive director of the Georgia EmergencyManagement Agency, said he expected 490,000 people would beevacuated from the state's barrier islands and other low-lying areas.   From Florida to the Carolinas, people stocked up on supplies toboard up windows and carry them through several days withoutelectricity and water.   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said Tim Brindley, manager of a Kmart in Mount Pleasant, S.C.   The governor requested shelters opened in eight coastal counties.His emergency declaration put the National Guard and state lawenforcement agencies on alert and ordered vans to be made availableto evacuate the elderly.   In Charleston, the 188-year-old City Hall was boarded up, schoolsand colleges canceled class and the mayor said the storm could bethe city's biggest catastrophe since a 1938 tornado that killed 32people and injured hundreds.   ``It's very important no one underestimate the danger of thishurricane,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.   The Navy sent its ships from Charleston to ride out the storm.Hunter Army Air Field in Savannah flew more than 60 helicoptersinland. Bases in Myrtle Beach and Charleston also planned to flyaircraft away from the storm.   Tropical Storm Iris was close behind. At 6 a.m. EDT, it was near22.7 north latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or 330 miles east ofGrand Turk Island. Winds were 45 mph as the storm movedwest-northwest at about 13 mph.   The last major storm to blow ashore in South Carolina was Graciein 1959, which struck near Beaufort with winds of more than 100 mph,leaving 22 dead and $14 million in damage.</TEXT></DOC>
