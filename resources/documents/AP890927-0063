The official, who asked not to be named, said more than 1,000refugees fled the Site 8 refugee camp into the mountains deeperinside Thai territory as the barrage was fired from inside Cambodia.   The shells were believed fired by Cambodian government troopsreacting to Khmer Rouge operations in the area.   ``The bunkers are full, the culverts are full. Nobody is out onthe road,'' the official said of the camp, which houses 41,000refugees. For safety reasons, the U.N. Border Relief Organizationplaced the camp off-limits to aid workers.   Fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border has intensified inrecent weeks as Vietnam announced a total pullout of its forcesthat were backing the Vietnam-installed government. Vietnam saysthe pullout was completed on Tuesday.   The Khmer Rouge are loosely allied to two non-communistguerrilla groups that have been fighting the Phnom Penh governmentand the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and toppled aKhmer Rouge government.   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia in 1975-1978. Duringthat time, hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million peopledied from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.   The Khmer Rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a newoffensive on the gem-trading center of Pailin in western Cambodiaand were shelling the town from all sides.   The guerrilla radio, the Voice of the National Army ofDemocratic Kampuchea, has recently claimed a series of battlesuccesses in the region around Pailin. The town is northwest ofPhnom Penh close to the Thai frontier.   The latest claim came late Tuesday, as Vietnamese troops werecompleting what they said was their final withdrawal.   A text of the broadcast was received today in Bangkok.   It said the guerrillas had reorganized into three attack forcesafter ``smashing the small, medium and large positions of theVietnamese enemies and their puppets ... protecting Pailin from thenorth and west.''   The radio charged that despite Vietnam's assurances that all itstroops have left Cambodia, Hanoi had sent 3,000 troops to helpdefend Pailin.   It was not possible to verify this claim. However, many Westernanalysts doubt that the Vietnamese would have left behind such alarge force.   Gen. Pat Akkanibut of Thailand's Supreme Military Command toldThe Associated Press that there were suspicions about a residualVietnamese military presence in Cambodia but that it was too earlyto make an assessment.   ``Let this game (withdrawal) finish and then we will watch,'' hesaid, adding that it was vital for all parties that aninternational monitoring mechanism be set up to determine whetherVietnam had kept its pledge.   Thailand supports the guerrillas and allows weapons from Chinato pass through its territory to their border bases.   In Trang Lon Tay, Vietnam, officers from a withdrawingVietnamese army division said today that they believe the Cambodiangovernment forces could quickly defeat the Khmer Rouge if Thailandstops giving them shelter.   ``If the Thai government stops its support of the guerrillas,the Cambodian government will have no problem ending theinsurgency,'' said Bui Buc Tran, deputy commander of the 5thDivision. ``We are completely satisfied that the Cambodian peoplenow have the full ability to defend themselves.''   Pat indicated that Thailand's backing would continue untilVietnam's withdrawal could be proved and external military aid fromall sides was halted. The Soviet Union is the major weaponssupplier for the Phnom Penh side.</TEXT></DOC>
