The driver loops twice past an anonymous house in ananonymous neighborhood, honking each time so guards can checkthat the Mercedes isn't being tailed. On the third pass, thecar veers into the driveway. Stern young men with submachineguns lurk in the bushes. At the door of the one-story villa,a guard frisks a visiting reporter and tests histape-recorder -- with the machine's microphone pointed at thejournalist's neck.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, waitsin an office decorated with photos of his commandos settingoff in speedboats to strike Israel. &quot;I am sorry for thewelcome,&quot; he says, gesturing at guards posted by his window.&quot;This is my life.&quot;   Mr. Abbas's life, as it unfolds in a three-hour interviewover tea, Turkish coffee and two packs of Marlborocigarettes, is the chilling tale of the making of aterrorist. It begins in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syriaand leads to this Baghdad lair, where Mr. Abbas plotted the1985 Achille Lauro hijacking and this year's attack on a TelAviv beach, which ended America's dialogue with the PalestineLiberation Organization.   Now, with his Iraqi patron, Saddam Hussein, under seige byU.S. forces, Mr. Abbas thinks the time may soon be ripe forrenewed commando warfare.   &quot;We see this as the battle for Palestine,&quot; he says of thePersian Gulf conflict. &quot;Winning it will get us closer tohome. Losing it will put us further away.&quot; Asked if terrorismis a necessary part of Saddam Hussein's struggle, heresponds: &quot;We use many ways to reach our aim.&quot;   In apparent anticipation of guerrilla strikes, the U.S.State Department took the unusual step of issuing a statementat 8:30 p.m. Friday saying, &quot;The United States would viewwith utmost seriousness any Iraqi-sponsored terroristattack.&quot; Iraq was restored to the department's list ofgovernments sponsoring terrorism on Sept. 1.   Among radical Palestinian leaders, Mr. Abbas's position isexceptional. His rap sheet of what he calls &quot;militaryoperations&quot; -- and what the West calls terrorism -- isexceeded only by the shadowy Abu Nidal and by Ahmed Jebril,who is believed to have masterminded the bombing of Pan Amflight 103.   But Mr. Abbas also sits on the PLO's 15-man executivecommittee, and therefore has a voice within the Palestinianmainstream. &quot;Abul Abbas is a symbol, to show that the PLOhasn't abandoned armed struggle,&quot; says Asad Abdul Rahman, amember of the PLO's parliament in exile.   To many in the West, Mr. Abbas is a much darker symbol:violent, uncompromising and determined to torpedo efforts atpeacefully resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. HelenaCobban, a Washington-based PLO expert and author of a leadingbook on the organization, describes Mr. Abbas as &quot;a low-levelthug&quot; and a &quot;mercenary gun-for-hire&quot; who has no realpolitical program. Long on the Iraqi payroll, he could becomeuseful to Saddam Hussein if he decides to &quot;activate theterror option,&quot; she says.   Although Mr. Abbas says he only strikes at Israeli&quot;military targets,&quot; civilians often have been cut down in thecrossfire. In a 1979 raid by PLF gunmen on the Israeli townof Nahariya, the four Israeli deaths included a four-year-oldgirl; a PLF commando crushed her skull with a machine gun.   Meeting an American in Baghdad for what he says is thefirst time, Mr. Abbas cuts an imposing, rather incongruousfigure. Broad-shouldered and six feet four inches tall, hehas the strong but softening build of a retired lumberjack.Ruggedly handsome, his thick black hair and mustache show nosigns of gray at 41. His eyes don't give much away; in thedimly-lit office, they are so dark as to seem all pupil.   Mr. Abbas's manner is disarming. Soft-voiced, his facewrinkles easily into laughter. He speaks passable English andflorid Arabic, filled with metaphor and rhythmic locutions. Agraduate in Arabic literature from the University ofDamascus, he also appears to be well-read. His favoriteWestern writer, he says, is William Shakespeare --&quot;particularly the tragedies.&quot; He says he was a schoolteacherin Syria before becoming a full-time &quot;freedom fighter.&quot;   This second career has left its mark. Brushing back hishair, Mr. Abbas reveals a jagged scar across his forehead,the result, he says, of an Israeli cluster bomb during thesiege of Beirut in 1982. He also has a bullet wound in eachthigh from guerrilla fighting in Jordan and the West Bank.&quot;That's the life,&quot; he says, chuckling grimly.   Asked if he has personally killed anyone, he responds witha half-smile, &quot;During the fight, you don't know whathappens.&quot; He adds that what happens in the heat of battle&quot;isn't just killing&quot; because &quot;this is war. Israel is ourenemy.&quot;   As for innocents who have died in this war, he shrugs.&quot;Accidents happen,&quot; he says.   Mr. Abbas welcomes the current Gulf conflict, which isgathering Palestinian extremists beneath the Iraqi tent incompany with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. Last week, a leadingradical, Syrian-based George Habash, made his first visit in11 years to Baghdad, where he met with both Mr. Abbas andSaddam Hussein. Palestinian sources say Abu Nidal already isin Iraq. And Mr. Abbas predicts that others, such as Mr.Jebril, also may soon defect from Syria to Saddam Hussein'scamp.   &quot;I think Saddam will win, and we will win as Arabs,&quot; Mr.Abbas says. &quot;When we support Iraq, we support our case asPalestinians.&quot;   While Mr. Abbas won't disclose what this support mightinclude, past exploits give some clue to future attacks.&quot;Ruthless stunts that often go wrong&quot; is how one Palestinianofficial describes PLF operations.   The group has staged strikes on Israel by hang glider, byhot-air balloon, by rubber dinghy and, most notoriously, byseajacking the cruise liner Achille Lauro (which he says wasto be taken to Israel, in part to free PLF fighters capturedin the 1979 Nahariya attack).   It was during the bungled Achille Lauro mission, when awheelchair-bound American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer, waskilled, that Mr. Abbas became known internationally. Theworld's most wanted terrorist, with U.S. warrants out for hisarrest for hostage-taking and piracy, he eluded a globalmanhunt, reportedly disguised in an Egyptair uniform. AnItalian court later convicted him in absentia and sentencedhim to life imprisonment.   Mr. Abbas is unapologetic for the death of the crippledMr. Klinghoffer, who was shot in the head and back and pushedoverboard. &quot;Maybe he was trying to swim for it,&quot; Mr. Abbascoldly suggested in 1988. Asked about the incident again lastweek, he bristled. &quot;Klinghoffer, always I hear about thisKlinghoffer,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody knows all the people who diein Palestine. But this Klinghoffer is like Jesus Christ.&quot;   Mr. Abbas also has no regrets over the failed attack on acrowded Tel Aviv beach last May. It was Mr. Arafat's refusalto denounce Mr. Abbas following the attack that led the U.S.to suspend its dialogue with the PLO. Four commandos werekilled and 12 captured in what Mr. Abbas says was an assaultaimed at military targets. &quot;For two years we say yes, yes,yes to America, without results,&quot; he says of the dialogue.&quot;Political ways have stopped now. Only we will fight.&quot;   Mr. Abbas says he still would welcome a negotiatedsettlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. But asked if he isprepared to recognize Israel, as Mr. Arafat has done, heresponds: &quot;For me, for our organization, we will not. We wantour land now and to build our state. After that we will say.&quot;   Mr. Abbas's hard-line views reflect the militancy of a newgeneration of Palestinians. In contrast to other splintergroups, some Marxist and others fundamentalist, the PLFappeals to young militants devoted to action rather than toideology. Members are carefully ranked, in military style,and tend to wear blue jeans, white shirts and combat boots.   One fiery-eyed lieutenant in Baghdad, who goes by the nameof Abu Nahar, says he follows Mr. Abbas because the PLF &quot;isfocused, rational, not emotional.&quot; He adds that all membersof the PLF, which may have a hard core of only 100, &quot;mustprove themselves in battle.&quot;   Mr. Abbas, ranked as secretary-general, is the youngestmember of the PLO's executive committee and the only one bornoutside of what is now Israel and its occupied territories.His parents fled their village near Haifa in 1948, just afterthe founding of Israel. Mohammed Zaidan Abbas was born a fewmonths later, in a Syrian refugee camp. The only image he hasof his family's village is from videotapes taken by friendswho have visited since.   Mr. Abbas says it is this separation from his homelandthat has made him so radical. Members of the PLO's old guard,he says, &quot;can balance between the truth and the dream. Butfor me, no. Everything is a dream. And dreams are always morepowerful than reality.&quot;   As a university student, Mr. Abbas says, he wanted to be aprofessor of literature. But the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, andthe occupation of the West Bank that followed, convinced himthat &quot;if I as a Palestinian do not fight now, then I amnothing.&quot;   While finishing his degree, and working briefly as ateacher, he plotted with other Palestinians and made severalraids across the Jordan River. In 1968, he joined Mr.Jebril's Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, and combed the camps of Jordan forrecruits.   From there, his rise through the PLO ranks was slow butsteady, aided since 1983 by the Iraqis and also by his secondmarriage to a close relative of Farouk Kaddoumi, a leadingArafat adviser.   Once known as a playboy, he has settled down and talksproudly of the oldest of his three sons, a teen-age computerwhiz. Palestinians in Baghdad say he is rarely seen anymoreoutside his closely-guarded compound.   &quot;This is my life,&quot; he says, casting his glance around thecluttered office. Lieutentants slip in and out with whisperedmissives. Papers are piled on his desk, with spectaclesperched on top. &quot;I live only for my dream,&quot; he says.   Like so many Palestinians, Mr. Abbas takes a very longview of his dream of regaining his homeland. &quot;There is anArabic saying that revenge takes 40 years,&quot; he says. &quot;If notmy son, then the son of my son will kill you. Some day, wewill have missiles that can reach New York.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
