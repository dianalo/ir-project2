The big clothing company he runs turned to the West afterthe Soviet Union, which used to buy half of the Czechfactory's output of garments, scrapped almost all itscontracts late last year. Making a major effort, thecompany's representatives found new customers in the U.S.,Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, avertingsweeping layoffs among the 7,000 workers.                                                                                                          But the success story was marred in May when a ship loadedwith woolen coats and suits was held up in New York Harbor.The company, OP Prostejov, had collided with import quotasdesigned to shield U.S. clothing makers from overseascompetitors. The company also was edging close to quotas inother Western nations. &quot;These barriers are verydisagreeable,&quot; says Mr. Tuhy.   Similar complaints can be heard elsewhere in EasternEurope. As Eastern officials see it, the very industries thathold the best prospects for success -- agriculture, textilesand steel -- correspond to politically powerful sectors inthe West that have perennially enjoyed protection fromimports. The world's 24 big industrial nations may havepledged some $38 billion in aid, but many Western leadershesitate to let in goods that might harm particularlysensitive areas of their own economies.   In April, Czechoslovak officials raised the problem withPresident Bush in the White House. &quot;He was very sympathetic-- but on textiles, he said it would be very difficultindeed,&quot; recalls Rita Klimova, the Czechoslovak ambassador tothe U.S. She is no happier with the European Community, whichfiercely protects its food, clothing and steel producers.   &quot;The EC is talking about environmental cooperation andcultural exchanges, but on the issue of trade, they'rerelegating it to the end of the century,&quot; Ambassador Klimovacomplains.   Outside of agriculture, textiles and steel, the West'srecord looks better. In 1990, the EC scrapped most importquotas on East bloc industrial goods, though some Easternexports have been derailed by EC anti-dumping actions. Still,concessions from the EC helped Poland and Hungary, the East'smost successful exporters, expand exports to the EC by 44%and 32% respectively. But despite the increased sales to theWest, Eastern Europe last year showed a 10% overall drop inexports, a result of the collapse of trade within the formerCommunist bloc and the limits on westward trade.   Economists note that the sectors the West seems intent onprotecting are the ones where the East bloc may have acompetitive advantage. For example, &quot;Eastern Europe is anatural breadbasket, ideally suited for cereal products,&quot;says David Roche, chief strategist with Morgan Stanley Co. inLondon. &quot;It should replace the inefficient cereal producersin Western Europe.&quot; He also sees advantages in textiles andcar assembly. &quot;We'll see a transfer of labor-intensiveproducts out of Western Europe into these countries,&quot; headds.   Conversely, East Europeans are finding that Western tradepolicy is most generous in sectors that don't matter much.Two months after the Czechoslovaks met with President Bush atthe White House, Vice President Dan Quayle visited Prague andtrumpeted an agreement allowing U.S. imports of Czechoslovaksmall firearms. Czechoslovak officials view this concessionas a drop in the Danube compared with what would be gained ifthe West opened up its textile and clothing markets.   Western officials say the barriers will come downeventually. The U.S., for its part, recently eased quotas ontextile and steel imports from the East bloc. Meanwhile,&quot;association agreements&quot; that Poland, Czechoslovakia andHungary are negotiating with the EC may bring other gains.The collapse of the Soviet market &quot;means that we're undergreat pressure to do something,&quot; says an EC official.   More broadly, EC leaders are willing to talk about lettingthe Eastern states compete for, and even win, a slice oftheir markets. &quot;There's no way we can avoid this,&quot; saysHenning Christophersen, the EC's commissioner for economicaffairs. &quot;Europe has to accept a new international divisionof labor, or we'll have an unhealthy client relationship&quot;with the East European states. But he insists that easternenterprises must shake free of state subsidies before theycan expect EC barriers to fall.   Although Western officials accept such a premise in theabstract, many fight it when it comes down to theparticulars. For example, Greece and Portugal have balked atthe notion of eliminating textile tariffs at the end of atransitional period in which the East Europeans would phaseout state subsidies. Spain has resisted a proposed phase-outfor protective arrangements for the steel industry. AndBritain, usually liberal on trade, is wary of too manyclothes pouring in from the East, like the state-subsidizedRomanian suits that have been showing up in Britain'swholesale market with price tags of as little as #23 ($39)each.   EC farmers, long addicted to subsidies and protection, mayturn out be the toughest nut to crack. In Hungary, whereagriculture accounts for 25% of exports, Sandor Szabo, deputydirector-general of the Ministry of International EconomicRelations, says he won't sign any EC association agreementthat doesn't free up farm trade. &quot;We want specific andmeaningful concessions in each important product,&quot; he says.   Western food aid to the Soviet Union has made thingsworse. Hungarian officials tried to revive some trade withthe Soviets, but talks chilled last year when the U.S. and ECboth mounted drives to give food to the Soviets or sell it atspecial prices. Mr. Szabo says Hungarian officials delivereda blunt message at a recent meeting with U.S. and Europeantrade ministers in Paris: &quot;It's okay if you want to supportthe Soviet Union, but don't make us bankrupt. That would be astrange kind of aid.&quot; The Hungarians want Western leaders toconsider a new approach to Soviet aid: The West would buyHungarian meats and grains and send them to the Soviet Unionvia established distribution routes.   Some East bloc officials think the West eventually willopen up, but they fear that countless farms and factorieswill go under during the wait. President Bush and otherWestern leaders have told East bloc officials that the tradetalks under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade willproduce a plan for phasing out the current textile quotasystem. But the GATT talks collapsed in December because of astalemate on farm aid, and won't be completed until nextyear.   &quot;It'll take years to eliminate the barriers,&quot; says AndrzejKemp, director of a Polish textile consortium.   In Prague, Czechoslovakia's economics minister, VladimirDlouhy, agrees. &quot;I don't need support in five years,&quot; hesays. &quot;I need it now and terribly so.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
