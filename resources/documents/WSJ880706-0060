The price increase may illustrate a drawback to Ford's strategy of relying on overseas manufacturers for engineering new models at a time of weakness for the dollar. The Probe was engineered for Ford by Mazda Motor Corp. in Japan and is built for Ford by Mazda in the U.S. Ford officials declined to comment on the implications for their strategy.    The Probe model has generated strong consumer demand, which Ford apparently feels gives it the leeway to raise prices. Ford says it has sold to dealers all the Probes that can be built for the rest of 1988.    The new base prices, which are as much as 1.9% higher than prices set at the Probe's introduction on May 12, range from $10,660 for the Probe GL model to $13,794 for the Probe GT model. The price rise took effect on cars ordered after July 1.    Ford officials said the appreciation of the yen greatly increased the cost of parts used to build the Probe models. Besides the engineering costs, about 60% of the parts in the cars, including the drive train, come from foreign suppliers. </TEXT></DOC>
