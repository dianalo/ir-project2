Nearly a million people, including workers, government employeesand grammar school students, flocked to central Beijing for thesecond straight day in support of the more than 3,000 weakeninghunger strikers.   ``The government wants us to go back and forget about dialogue,they don't comprehend the power of this movement,'' hunger strikeleader Wu'er Kaixi, an oxygen tube in his nose, said from his bedin Beijing Hospital, where he was rushed after fainting during themeeting with Li.   Two students who attended the meeting quoted Li Peng as sayingBeijing has fallen into anarchy and that if the movement does notend, ``it will be more chaotic than the Cultural Revolution.'' The1966-76 ultraleftist uprising brought China to the brink of civilwar.   The national television news broadcast included a segment on themeeting in the Great Hall of the People that showed Li urging allsteps be taken to save the fasting students.   He praised the students for raising problems such as officialcorruption but added, ``The development of the situation does notdepend on your good will and your intentions. Nobody can control itnow. Beijing already is in disorder and it is spreading to thewhole country.''   The television did not show the students' response.   No more meetings were scheduled immediately, according to thesources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The talks came hours after Li, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyangand other senior officials visited some of the hundreds of studentshospitalized during the hunger strike, which was also televised.Leaders were shown listening to students and patting their arms inconcern.   Beijing television showed Li awkwardly autographing students'shirts at their request, and saying, ``Where are you from? Go homenow.''   Authorities have commended the students' enthusiasm fordemocracy but have not agreed to their demands for a dialogue onreform to be broadcast live.   The students have been agitating for reforms including pressfreedom, an end to official corruption as well as recognition oftheir independent unions.   They began their fast for democracy Saturday in centralTiananmen Square, China's symbolic center of power, which they haveturned into a vast tent camp decorated by protest banners. So manyhave taken ill that one luxury hotel was turned into a makeshifthospital.   On Wednesday, more than 1 million people marched in support ofthe hunger strikers in an outpouring that repeatedly disrupted thestate visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to end a30-year chill in relations with China.   In Beijing today, a steady stream of hundreds of trucks filledwith workers, some wearing factory uniforms and banging their hardhats against the sideboard, rumbled toward Tiananmen, which wasdrenched in a midafternoon thunderstorm. Many of the vehicles hadlarge posters that said, ``Support the students.'' Posters of MaoTse-tung began to spring up, with demonstrators saying he cared forthe people before he went senile in his final years.   Official newspapers offered comprehensive and sympatheticcoverage to the protests, a departure from past policy.   Protesters marched for a second day in Shanghai, which Gorbachevwas visiting, and industrial strikes in support of the studentswere also reported.   Smaller marches were held Wednesday in more than 20 provincialcapitals.   In Beijing, 200 Communist Party members marched behind a bannerthat called for the resignation of China's 84-year-old seniorleader: ``Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the party members want you to takea rest.''   Several hundred workers marched shouting, ``Step down Li Peng,''while a group of high school students chanted, ``Xiaoping,Xiaoping, 80 years old, and not very sharp.''   The independent student union that has spearheaded the democracymovement also called on Deng to step down. Deng's last officialpost is chairman of the Central Military Commission but he still isactive in setting policy.   Unconfirmed rumors sweeping Tiananmen that he already hadretired were wildly cheered.   Nearly 250,000 students marched today in Shanghai, where about200 students were staging a hunger strike in front of city hall.Thousands of cheering workers lined the march route, said JasonHurtado of Portland, Ore., a teacher at Shanghai's Fudan University.   The Beijing marchers have included members of the CommunistParty Youth League, government workers, soldiers, privatebusinessmen, factory workers, teachers, doctors, students, writers,artists.   The hunger strikers moved into buses parked in Tiananmen thismorning when dark skies threatened rain, but said they would notmove from the square.   ``I'm drinking, so I'm still hanging on, but I feel really,really hungry and I don't have much energy,'' said faster Wei Wei.   ``We won't give up until we get our goals,'' a protest leadersaid over a student-rigged loudspeaker system.   Zhao, Li and several other senior officials went to twohospitals at about 4 a.m. and visited hunger strikers.   Qiao Shi, who is in charge of Communist Party discipline, wasquoted as telling one hunger-striker, ``It's best you go back toclass.''</TEXT></DOC>
