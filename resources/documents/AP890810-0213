She gave her account number to the caller, then got hersuitcases ready. The bill came but the trip didn't.   Zucker was taken by what's known as telemarketing fraud, one ofseveral gimmicks used by sophisticated thieves who prey on themultibillion dollar credit-card industry. Their tools to falsify,duplicate and deceive range from purloined credit-card receipts tomicrowave ovens used to alter stolen cards.   The victims bear little or no financial liability if they reportfrauds promptly. But their credit ratings may be tainted until thefrauds are detected. The credit-card industry says all users areindirect victims because the cost of fraud is passed on via highercredit-card interest rates for everyone.   The industry has combatted a counterfeiting problem with somesuccess in the United States by making cards harder to duplicate.Nonetheless it still faces steady losses through phony customerapplications, doctored cards and the ``boiler-room'' schemes likethe one that ruined Zucker's vacation plans.   ``Every time we close a door they're working on the other doorsto see if they're open,'' said Richard Ward, special agent incharge of the New York field office of the Secret Service, whichhas jurisdiction over crimes involving credit cards. ``It neverseems to stop.''   For the first half of this year, the Secret Service said it made760 credit card-related arrests and estimates industrywide lossesfrom those cases at $89.7 million. Last year it made 1,846 arrestsand put losses at $189.1 million, up from 1,620 arrests in 1987 and$27.4 million in losses.   While the statistics show progress in enforcement, major creditcard companies and credit reporting agencies say many morehucksters _ from common thieves to foreign-based crime rings _remain busy filching fortunes.   Industrywide credit-card losses are difficult to assess. VisaInternational, the largest bank credit-card issuer, said it lost$188.8 million worldwide last year, telemarketing fraud excluded,accounting for 0.09 percent of its total volume.   That was up from $166.1 million the previous year, although downslightly in volume, from 0.10 percent. In 1983, the year before theSecret Service took over enforcement of revised federal credit-cardlaws, Visa lost $101.7 million, or 0.15 percent of total volume.   MasterCard International Inc. said worldwide losses totaled$128.67 million in 1988, telemarketing fraud excluded, or 0.10percent of volume, up from $98.9 million, or 0.09 percent in 1987.Six years ago losses totaled $65.5 million, or 0.13 percent ofvolume.   American Express Co., another leading issuer of plastic, doesn'trelease figures on fraud-related losses.   Some experts say that besides Christmas, the summer-fallvacation season is the busiest time of year for credit-cardthieves, who find that naive travelers make the easiest targets.   ``A lot occurs outside the United States in locations wheretravel is frequent,'' said Joel S. Lisker, vice president ofsecurity and fraud control at MasterCard.   Lisker said the Asia-Pacific region has replaced France andSpain as a growing problem area, with card counterfeiting andalterations by street gangs accounting for nearly half of the totalfraud losses reported there.   In a common fraud case here and abroad, a thief will steal anunsuspecting tourist's credit card, then charge the maximum amountallowed before the victim reports the card missing, said William D.Neumann, a senior vice president of security and risk management atVisa.   A stolen card also can be altered _ and later used _ by filingor melting the account number in a microwave oven and re-embossingit with a legitimate number. This could come from dishonestmerchants or thieves who rifle trash cans outside a store orrestaurant for discarded credit-card receipts.   Some dishonest merchants accept what are known as ``whitecards,'' or plain plastic embassed with legitimate names andnumbers that give the appearance of a legal transaction when passedthrough a credit-card machine.   Ward said a growing threat is the more sophisticated thief whofiles fraudulent credit-card applications with a smathering oflegitimate information. In many cases, that information comes fromcriminals who take jobs as janitors or security guards in order tosteal personnel records, he said.   Legitimate information can also come from telemarketing consthat include claims of low-cost travel club memberships orsweepstake contests, he said.   In the case of Zucker, con artists claimed to represent aChicago travel agent in a promotional deal offered to Visa cardmembers. It took months for Zucker to realize the scam, becausebefore she paid the bill, she received mailed information on traveldestinations to choose from in the next year.   Zucker is among the lucky. Some hucksters use the numbersreceived over the phone to charge up a storm, as well as apply fornew credit cards.   ``The other day some guy ordered an $8,000 watch over the phoneand charged it to his credit card,'' Ward said. ``What made itsuspicious was the guy was from the Bronx (N.Y) and the store wasin some small town in Maryland.''   Under laws designed to protect cardholders, they are liable forup to $50 of unauthorized purchases before reporting a card missing.   Because credit-card frauds are becoming more sophisticated, thecard companies are concocting new anti-fraud devices that expand onthe introduction of hard-to-duplicate magnetic patterns placed oncards in the early 1980s.   Visa, for example, has introduced an optional security devicethat will add more information to the magnetic strips that willverify a card isn't phony. MasterCard said it will introduce thesame optional feature within the next few months, along withharder-to-erase embossed numbers.   The two credit-card giants also have established a specialcomputerized clearinghouse in Chicago to screen applications. About70 percent of all U.S. card application volume is processed there,Lisker said.   He said the clearinghouse checks data and alerts members when aname, address, or Social Security numbers are used repeatedly,thwarting possible fraudulent applications.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance Sunday, Aug. 13</NOTE></DOC>
