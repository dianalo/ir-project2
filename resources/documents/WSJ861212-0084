Pilot Laboratories Corp. of Vancouver said the new test gives a result in 10 minutes compared with two to four hours required for AIDS blood tests currently used. Pilot Laboratories, which specializes in commercializing medical technology, said it provided $6 million to Murex Corp. of Norcross, Ga., to develop the test.    Murex, a closely held biotechnology concern, plans to begin producing and selling the test sometime next year, provided it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.    Both Pilot and Murex claim that in laboratory trials the new test produced fewer erroneous results than the older tests. However, Jarel Kelsey, president and chief executive officer of Murex, declined to give details. &quot;We have to conduct a number of more formal clinical trials to validate the claims we'd want to make&quot; for the test's accuracy, he said. He noted that other companies are racing to develop similar AIDS blood tests and &quot;we don't want to reveal our performance claims to competitors just now.&quot;    Like current blood tests, the new Murex test detects antibodies that a person exposed to the AIDS virus has built up in his blood in an attempt to fend off the virus. The exposed person may or may not develop AIDS. The Murex test uses so-called monoclonal antibodies produced in the laboratory that are designed specifically to attach themselves to the patient's anti-AIDS antibodies. Older blood tests use enzymes to detect anti-AIDS antibodies.    The Murex test involves dropping a number of tiny, specially prepared latex beads into the well of a small, disposable plastic container and then adding a few drops of the patient's blood and a chemical reagent. If after 10 minutes, a tiny window exhibits a blue color, it indicates the patient has been exposed to the AIDS virus.    The new test's rapidity is likely to appeal to physicians who test individual patients and to laboratories and blood banks that do a small volume of AIDS blood testing. Large blood banks and screening programs currently are automating the older blood tests, allowing them to process hundreds of blood samples per hour despite the two to four hours required to get a result from each sample. </TEXT></DOC>
