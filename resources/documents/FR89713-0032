Communications must identify thenumber of this SFAR. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing listfor future rules should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2Awhich describes the application procedure.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Each year the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) holds its nationalconvention at Oshkosh, WI; this year the dates of the convention are July31 through August 3. During these conventions unusually large numbers ofaircraft operate into and out of Oshkosh. The FAA estimates that the numberof aircraft participating will be on the order of 15,000 or more. Manyof those aircraft will be traveling through or near the Chicago area enrouteto or from the convention.The FAA works with the EAA in a number of ways to provide for the safetyof all participants and non-participants. During the period of the convention,the FAA establishes a temporary air traffic control ``tower'' using bothradio and visual signals to control traffic and works with the EAA to establishprocedures for aircraft arrival and departure at the convention. Despitethe extraordinary number of aircraft which travel to this convention andparticipate in it each year, the convention has an excellent safety record.On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule expanding the requirementsfor the use of transponders with altitude encoding capability (Mode C)within 30 nautical miles of TCA primary airports, commonly referred toas the ``veil.'' O'Hare International Airport in Chicago is an exampleof a TCA primary airport. Those requirements became effective on July 1,1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Need for Regulation</ITAG>Many of the aircraft which participate in the EAA convention are of a typewhich are excluded from the requirements of the Mode C rule because thoseaircraft do not have an electrical system necessary to support the ModeC equipment. Many others are not excluded and would be required to carrythe Mode C equipment for operations within 30 miles of O'Hare Airport unlessotherwise authorized by ATC under the provisions of the rule. The FAA isprepared to accommodate the number of requests which will occur on a routinebasis, as well as the unusual number of requests expected during the periodimmediately after the effective date of the rule on July 1. However, theFAA estimates that if each non-equipped aircraft bound to or from the EAAconvention and traveling through the Chicago area were to request an authorization,the number of requests would be more than could be processed. Further,the FAA believes that, generally those aircraft which circumnavigate theTCA and 30-mile veil will not create a condition of compressed traffic.However, where the number of aircraft involved is as great as that expectedfor the EAA convention, and if the non-equipped aircraft covered by theregulation are required to circumnavigate the veil, the possibility ofsuch congestion would be increased to a level which the FAA has determinedwould decrease the operational efficiency of the air traffic system inthe Chicago area. In addition, many of the aircraft proceeding to Oshkoshare experimental, home-built, or antique aircraft which are not normallyoperated in long cross-country flights. Many such aircraft, while passingeast of Chicago on the way to and from Oshkosh, would be required to operateover Lake Michigan up to 20 miles from the shore.On the basis of the above, I find that these conditions constitute a situationrequiring immediate action by the agency in order to maintain efficiencyin the operation of aircraft in the Chicago area and avoid unnecessarycompression of traffic during the periods of convention arrivals and departures.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>This rule suspends applicability of the requirement to carry a Mode C transponderwhen operating below 3,000 feet MSL between 10.5 nautical miles and 30nautical miles from O'Hare Airport. The suspension of these requirementsis only for the period of July 23, 1989 until August 6, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date of Final Rule</ITAG>Because of the pending arrival in Oshkosh of large numbers of aircraftbeginning in late July, immediate action is required to maintain the efficiencyof flight operations in the Chicago area at an acceptable level. For thisreason, and because the condition will begin to occur on July 26, I findthat the notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticableand contrary to the public interest. For the same reason, I find that goodcause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after issuance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment</ITAG>The FAA has determined that this action is not a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and is not considered a ``significant rule'' under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The immediatenature of the action required does not permit the prior completion of afull regulatory evaluation. The rule has no identifiable costs. Benefitsof the rule will be the most efficient routing of a large number of aircraftthrough the Chicago area during the July 23-August 6 period and a mitigationof the potential impact on ATC resources resulting from the Oshkosh convention.These benefits are not practically quantifiable, however. Because the actionis a nonsignificant rulemaking and is temporary, a further regulatory evaluationwill not be performed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Determination</ITAG>The amendment set forth herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this regulation does not have federalismimplications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 91</ITAG>Aviation safety, Visual flight rules, ATC transponder and altitude reportingequipment and use.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Special Federal Aviation Regulation</ITAG>For the reasons set forth above, the Federal Aviation Administration isamending 14 CFR Part 91 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 91_GENERAL OPERATING AND FLIGHT RULES</ITAG>1.
