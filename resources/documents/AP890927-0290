(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former presidents of a defunctpenny-stock brokerage firm _ including a former federal securitiesexaminer _ were among five men who pleaded guilty Wednesday toviolating federal securities laws and bilking about $68 millionfrom investors.   Sheldon Kanoff, 53, of Flushing, N.Y., a former president ofParamus-based F.D. Roberts Securities Inc., confessed guilt beforeU.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan to two counts of securitiesfraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud anddefraud the U.S. government.   Kanoff became the 11th F.D. Roberts employee to plead guilty toillegal practices in the penny-stock field. He had worked as achief examiner for broker-dealer inspection for the Securities andExchange Commission's New York office from 1970 to 1983, headinginvestigations of securities fraud.   Former F.D. Roberts president, treasurer and partner AlbertWeiss, 44, of Ramsey, pleaded guilty to one count of securitiesfraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Healso admitted filing a false tax return in 1987.   Both men admitted that from March 1985 to February 1989, F.D.Roberts hired brokers with little or no experience and trained themto badger customers into buying securities at inflated prices.   Kanoff, a member of the firm's board who shared in its profits,also told the judge that F.D. Roberts funds were used to payorganized crime figures who had undisclosed interests in the firm.   ``There was money owed to organized crime figures and money tobe paid to organized crime figures,'' said First Assistant U.S.Attorney Michael Chertoff.   Kanoff faces 15 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000.Weiss faces a 13-year prison term and fines of up to $750,000.Sentencing was set for November 14.   Kanoff, Weiss and the three others who entered guilty pleas toldthe judge that F.D. Roberts brokers used deceptive and manipulativesales techniques to persuade customers to buy stocks the firmusually controlled, and that false records were maintained.   They also said some of those involved in fraudulent activitywould would maintain nominee accounts and profit by as much as 400percent in one day.   Earlier Wednesday, three former brokers _ John Landrum, 31, andKevin Zacharawicz, 35, both of Boca Raton, Fla.; and Fred Schneiderof Sparta _ pleaded guilty to stock fraud.   Each faces a five-year jail term and a $250,000 fine.   F.D. Roberts' had branch offices in New York, Florida andCalifornia.   Penny stocks are low-priced securities that are not listed onany exchange.   The firm, which has been under investigation by state andfederal authorities for about 1{-years, voluntarily closed inFebruary after the National Association of Securities Dealersinformed it that it fell below the minimum capital requirements.   F.D. Roberts' former national sales manager, a former branchmanager, two assistant branch managers and two other brokersalready have pleaded guilty to using similar fraudulent practiceson clients.   Four of the firm's top executives, including Kanoff, have beenbanned by the NASD from working in the securities industry.</TEXT></DOC>
