It is a private company run by whites, working for the benefit of black nationalist Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    And in a region thick with suspicion and intrigue, officials of the company, which is known as BCG, have won a great deal of credibility by talking to factions and governments that refuse to have anything to do with one another.    They've trekked to the Mozambique bush to meet the leaders of the Mozambique National Resistance movement, or Renamo, the anti-government guerrillas, hoping to convince them to ease off their acts of sabotage. &quot;Nobody, not even the American State Department, is talking to Renamo at the moment,&quot; says Eddie Cross, BCG's managing director. (In an effort to free an American nurse kidnapped by Renamo, a State Department official has met once with a Renamo representative in Washington.) The group's representatives have even traveled to Pretoria, where no African leader dares go.    Their purpose is to promote the resurrection of the Beira Corridor, a road and rail link between Zimbabwe and the Indian Ocean port city of Beira, in Mozambique. If successful, the effort would provide a huge boost to the shattered economy of Mozambique and give landlocked Zimbabwe some relief from its heavy trade dependence on South Africa.    Denis Norman, the BCG chairman and a former Zimbabwean politician, has met with South African President P.W. Botha, explaining that the Beira Corridor project shouldn't be seen as an action against South Africa but one that is in the black states' economic self-interest.    &quot;If nobody is talking to anybody in this region, we'll never accomplish anything,&quot; says Mr. Norman.    In South Africa, a top Foreign Ministry official denies Pretoria has ever opposed projects aimed at integrating southern African economies. He says it won't stand in the way of the corridor project either, and denies that South Africa is aiding Renamo, as it has in the past. &quot;We've lost contact with them,&quot; he says.    Managing Director Cross says BCG is a fund-raiser, lobbyist and logistical troubleshooter whose main function is to promote and coordinate the rehabilitation project.    But because of its rare contacts in the region, the group is also trying to act as a peacemaker whose primary contribution is to cool some of the region's harsh rhetoric. For instance, says Mr. Cross, it isn't in the interest of either Zimbabwe or South Africa to impose economic sanctions against each other, despite threats to do so.    &quot;Whether they like each other or not, they need each other,&quot; says a BCG official.    If BCG is emerging as a power broker in southern Africa, one wouldn't know it by looking at its headquarters. The group is holed up in an ordinary-looking, two-story house in Zimbabwe's leafy northern suburbs. The sign on the gate just says 183, the street number.    For Mr. Cross, the more inconspicuous BCG is, the better. The company has received anonymous threats -- perhaps from government dissidents in Zimbabwe and neighboring Mozambique or from right-wing elements in South Africa, Mr. Cross muses -- and he has been sent pictures of himself with a bull's-eye drawn over his face. &quot;Not everyone appreciates what we're trying to do,&quot; he says.    Progress in reopening the Beira Corridor would mark a major victory for the Southern African Development Coordination Conference, which is trying to turn the region into a kind of common market. But the three-year, $300 million task faces great obstacles.    The corridor, once one of the major trading routes of southern Africa, has fallen into disrepair and disuse during Mozambique's civil war. The road is a 200-mile stretch of potholes, the railway a rusting line of inefficiency and the port a crumbling relic. What's more, it is a favorite target of Renamo.    As a result, most of the traffic that once went through Beira now goes through South Africa, to the more distant port of Durban. This increases shipping time and cost, and makes the region more reliant on South Africa. In its heyday in the 1960s, the port of Beira handled about five million tons of goods a year; today, the figure is down to 1.4 million tons.    BCG was formed a year ago as a private company representing a consortium of 200 Zimbabwe businesses interested in using the corridor. BCG officials are logging plenty of miles outside Africa, as they have taken their lobbying and fund-raising campaign to Europe and the U.S. In September, a group of regional businessmen with a stake in BCG will visit Washington to whip up interest in the project and to discourage Western support for Renamo.    According to the BCG pitch, the southern Africa region won't be settled politically until it gets on its feet economically. The economic collapse in Mozambique, for instance, has bred a political malaise among the people, weakening their resolve to fight on one side or the other.    &quot;Once they have the economic structures, like the corridor, they will have something that's worth defending, as well as attacking,&quot; says Mr. Norman. &quot;If we get the economics right, hopefully the politics will fall into place.&quot;    Mr. Cross says that a fully running Beira Corridor could earn $100 million a year for Mozambique, which is more than the country's total export earnings last year. It would also save about $250 million annually in shipping costs that is now spent going through South Africa.    But money isn't a problem for BCG. It raised some funds locally by offering debentures to Zimbabwean businesses, and the rest of the $300 million is coming from international donors. The biggest obstacle, says Mr. Cross, is the bureaucracy.    &quot;Do you know what it's like,&quot; he asks, &quot;to work with five governments and 32 donor agencies?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
