The Council on Competitiveness said the government shouldemphasize two dozen commercial technologies that the councildeemed &quot;critical,&quot; and said the U.S. is in a generally weakor poor competitive position in seven of these technologies.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In too many sectors, America took technology forgranted,&quot; a report released by the council yesterday said.&quot;Today, the nation is paying the price for that complacency.&quot;   The report made detailed evaluations of the U.S.competitive posture in technologies spanning nine majorindustries, but it was strikingly vague on the amount ofmoney the U.S. should spend to improve its position. That'sindicative of the fine political line the council is tryingto walk. The White House has ignored previous pitches byindustry to spend billions revitalizing the consumerelectronics and semiconductor industries, claiming that suchspending would represent an unwise &quot;industrial policy&quot; ofgovernment intrusion into the marketplace.   Instead, the council tried to placate potential WhiteHouse opponents by framing its request in terms of the sortof fundamental research that the administration has said itwould support. A model cited in the report is a supercomputernetwork that the administration this year supported, morethan 10 years after it was first proposed by Sen. AlbertGore, (D., Tenn.).   The council urged the federal government to &quot;increasedramatically&quot; the share of federal research funds forcritical commercial technologies beginning with the budgetfor the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1993. In fiscal 1988,the report said, the U.S. only spent 0.2% of its researchfunds on industrial technology, compared with 4.8% by Japanand 14.5% by West Germany. During that same year, the reportsaid, the U.S. spent 65.6% of its research money on defense,compared with 4.8% by Japan and 12.5% by West Germany.   The report said the U.S. was in a generally strongcompetitive position in seven technologies: biotechnology,environmental technology, software, computers, databases,advanced graphics and propulsion. The U.S. also trailed itscompetitors in seven technologies: electronic materials,production systems, manufacturing equipment, electronicdisplays, optoelectronic components, hard-copy technology andelectronic packaging.   In the remaining nine technologies, the U.S. was roughlyeven with its competitors: advanced materials, materialsprocessing, design tools, microelectronics, electroniccontrols, information storage, communications, portabletelecommunications equipment and powertrain technology.   Overall, the report said the U.S. did best in technologiesthat are closely linked with basic research and don't requireheavy capital investment. U.S. companies did worse in areasthat required heavy investment over long periods of time andinvolved intricate manufacturing.   Given the backdrop that the Persian Gulf war was seen as atriumph for U.S. technology, the report was surprisinglydownbeat on depending on military research-and-developmentspending to spur innovation -- the pattern since World WarII. Civilian technology is much more advanced than defensetechnology, the report said, and defense procurementpractices hinder the introduction of new technology. &quot;In manycases, defense needs to reach out and find the latesttechnology from commercial areas,&quot; said Bobby Inman, aretired admiral and former intelligence official who chairedthe committee that prepared the council's report.   To get money for commercial technologies, Mr. Inman saidthe U.S. could stretch out big science projects such as thespace station or superconducting supercollider.</TEXT></DOC>
