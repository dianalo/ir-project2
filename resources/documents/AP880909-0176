About 500 soldiers mutinied and joined the massive movement foran interim government and full democracy in the first majordefection of troops to the opposition.   More than 200 dependents from several diplomatic missions,including 46 Americans, left Burma as a precautionary move, leavingabout 400 others still to be evacuated.   In a letter to embassies, U Nu called for general elections Oct.9. He announced a 26-member Cabinet with himself as prim minister,former President Mahn Win Maung as president and retired GeneralTin Oo, a vocal critic of the current authoritarian regime, sdefense minister.   Diplomats said U Nu's chances of success are difficult toassess. His country remains on the brink of chaos and the powerfulmilitary is still intact. Some opposition leaders criticized themove.   The move, which follows weeks of massive, occasionally bloodyturmoil in this isolated Southeast Asian nation, is considered hightreason under present Burmese law.   But neither President Maung Maung's government nor the militaryresponded publicly to the act. Some of U Nu's fellow oppositionleaders said formation of a parallel government could cause``disunity among the people.''   ``I have taken back the power which General Ne Win has robbedfrom me,'' the 82-year-old U Nu wrote. ``From this hour, sovereignpower no longer rests with General Ne Win. It has come back into myhands, and I announce this fact with joy.''   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. Ne Win resigned ashead of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party in July, but manyanalysts believe he still controls it.   Today's announcement was not the first time U Nu has tried toregain control of Burma. In the 1970s, he attempted to lead ananti-Ne Win insurgency from bases along the Thai-Burmese border butthe plan failed.   About 400 air force personnel and about 100 troops from the navyand army marched in a student-led demonstration, calling on troopsinside City Hall to join them. But they received no response.   Most of the deserters were enlisted men, but reporters sawseveral lieutenants.   Earlier Friday, about 200 air force men fled to the RangoonUniversity campus, the headquarters for student revolt. It was thefirst major military defection to demonstrators seeking to topplethe authoritarian system.   The soldiers shouted: ``We side with democracy and not withfascists!'' and ``Our military training is not to shoot people!''   Asked about the significance of U Nu's move, a Western diplomatin Bangkok said: ``He's a good figurehead rather than a leader atthis point. It will depend on who his advisers are and also on theattitude of the military.''   ``His main value will be as a symbol,'' said another Westerndiplomat. ``He seems to enjoy the support of the majority.''   But key opposition leader Aung Gyi called U Nu's move``preposterous'' and Aung San Suu Kyi, another major oppositionist,told newsmen: ``I am only worried that such a move could causedisunity among the people. If people support it, I will have tosupport it.''   Aung Gyi urged people to wait until Monday when a special partycongress decides on a referendum that could lead to democracy. ``Itdoesn't pay to be rash at this delicate moment,'' he said.   Protesters have demanded immediate formation of an interimgovernment to oversee a transition to democracy. They blame theparty's military autocracy for repression and economic policiesthat transformed resource-rich Burma into one of the world'spoorest nations.   ``Our country was ahead of Thailand before the army took over 26years ago. We are about 50 years behind Thailand now,'' Aung Gyitold a news conference Friday.   Some analysts believe U Nu may be trying to take the initiativefrom the Maung Maung government and entice the military to hisside. Others say the formation of a rival government could provokethe military into a crackdown or coup.   A special Thai Airways flight evacuated more than 230 dependentsand non-essential staffers from numerous embassies. Diplomats saidthe evacuees included Americans, Australians, Filipinos,Malaysians, Indonesians, British, Japanese, South Koreans, Sovietsand Thais.   ``Foreigners are not in danger at present but life is verydifficult,'' said one World Bank official after arrival in Bangkok.``There's no fuel and less and less food.''   A Rangoon diplomat, speaking anonymously, noted supplies ofwater and electricity also were becoming irregular.   Students rioted in September 1987 to protest economic policiesand led broader-based street protests in March and June. Riotsflared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the party chosehard-liner Sein Lwin to succeed him.   The government said 112 people died in Rangoon in riotingagainst Sein Lwin, who resigned after 17 days as leader. Diplomatsbelieve many more people were killed.   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilianleader in 26 years. He lifted martial law in Rangoon and curfewsnationwide five days later, but protests continued.</TEXT></DOC>
