Foley says he willvote against a constitutional amendment to protect the flag if theSupreme Court throws out the federal law against flag burning.   By tradition, the Speaker of the House rarely votes and Foleyhas not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago. But Foleysaid he would come off the speaker's podium and vote ``no'' if theHouse considered a constitutional amendment.   Foley last year supported passage of the law against flagburning. But he said amending the Constitution, and especially theFirst Amendment definition of ``elemental freedoms of thiscountry,'' was not justified.   The First Amendment ``is the most sacred part of theconstitutional document, and to amend it for these reasons would beextraordinarily unwise,'' Foley said. ``I think the judgment ofhistory would be unkind on the Congress or the state legislaturesif that were to occur.''   The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for May 14 onwhether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that theflag burning statute passed by Congress last year isunconstitutional.   Foley has promised a House vote on a constitutional amendmentwithin 30 days if the court rules against the statute.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>Thornburgh Says Justice Unit Will Review Findings of Gray Leak</HEAD><TEXT>   Probe</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says he willdirect the Justice Department's internal disciplinary unit toreview the results of an FBI leak investigation.   Thornburgh said Tuesday the Office of ProfessionalResponsibility will review the inconclusive results of an FBIinquiry into leaks about a criminal investigation involving allegedfinancial irregularities in the office of Rep. William Gray III,D-Pa.   The leak to CBS News _ at a crucial time while Gray was runningfor House majority whip last spring _ produced a storm of criticismfrom Democrats on Capitol Hill who charged it was politicallyinspired.   It forced the Justice Department to take the unusual step ofsaying that Gray was not a target of the investigation, and that hewas cooperating with the FBI.   The extensive leak investigation ordered by Thornburgh failed toidentify the source with certainty.   The attorney general's decision in December not to refer thematter to the OPR for possible disciplinary action was criticizedby several lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairmanof the Senate Judiciary Committee.   At a hearing of the panel Tuesday, Thornburgh told Biden that hewould ask OPR to review the report produced by the FBIinvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
