Yet the fact that de Klerk states these goals, repeatedly andearnestly, sets him apart from the men who preceded him in power.   Prominent black opponents of his government are deeply skeptical,and they may be proved right. Some of them concede, however, thatthe government for the first time has adopted a rhetoric, if not yeta policy, that reflects some of their own hopes.   ``His vision of a new South Africa ... is the vision we want,''said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 NobelPeace Prize and one of the government's most persistent critics.   So sweeping are some of de Klerk's statements _ no more whitedomination, a phasing out of discrimination _ that he may find hehas raised expectations he cannot meet.   He acknowledged this in his inaugural speech Wednesday, saying hewould not accept responsibility for ``overenthusiastic or twistedversions'' of his policy.   He will be under heavy pressure to move quickly, withanti-apartheid leaders and Western governments saying they wantdecisive steps taken within the next several months. Among the movesde Klerk will consider:   _Releasing Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other jailed leadersof the African National Congress guerrilla movement. De Klerk knowsthat a broad range of black leaders will refuse to negotiate on anew constitution unless Mandela goes free, and is likely to approvethe release despite fears in some government quarters that it couldspark a wave of unrest.   _Modifying or repealing the remaining legislative cornerstones ofapartheid, the laws which classify South Africans by race, allowmunicipalities to segregate public facilities, and establishsegregated residential districts.   ``The continued removal of discrimination is an importantobjective,'' said de Klerk in his inaugural speech. But he has yetto renounce his support for segregated schools and neighborhoods.   _Lifting the state of emergency, which has been in effect sinceJune 1986. De Klerk says hopes to ``create a climate'' in which theemergency can be ended, and he already has negated some of impact byordering police to allow peaceful mass protest marches. But policecontinue to detain activists without charge.   Gavin Relly, chairman of South Africa's largest conglomerate andfrequent critic of apartheid, has urged the international communityto give de Klerk a chance to carry out his program without imposinga timetable or threatening further sanctions.   ``Just as Mikhail Gorbachev (in the Soviet Union) has found thatperestroika cannot be achieved in the twinkling of an eye, and thatserious attitudinal and institutional obstacles have to beconfronted and gradually overcome, so Mr. de Klerk will have toconfront difficulties of the same order,'' said Relly, chairman ofthe Anglo American Corp.   The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper in Jonhannesburg,also likened de Klerk to Gorbachev, saying both leaders werelearning that the process of reform ``is not to direct change, butto ease controls and wait for the unknowable to happen.''   For de Klerk, this syndrome is most evident in his decision twoweeks ago, while acting president, to allow mass protest marches.Tens of thousands of people of all races have joined anti-governmentparades in major cities, including militants displaying banners ofthe African National Congress.   ``Like Gorbachev, de Klerk has a security establishment whoprefer the old way of doing things,'' said The Weekly Mail.``Perhaps the biggest question if whether de Klerk sharesGorbachev's resolve and wile to outmaneuver the 'securocrats.''   The centerpiece of de Klerk's program is a vague proposal tonegotiate a new constitution that will extend political rights tothe country's 28 million blacks while protecting the 5 millionwhites from black domination.   In effect, de Klerk is suggesting that each racial group wouldhave veto power over major policy decisions, with deadlocks to bebroken by some sort of independent arbitrator.   It is highly unlikely that even moderate black leaders, let alonethe ANC, would accept an outcome that falls so far short of aone-person, one-vote system.   The ANC released a statement Friday night dismissing de Klerk'spledges of reform and calling for a continued armed struggle againstthe government.   ``The rhetoric mouthed by de Klerk at his inauguration once morebears out our firm conviction that no white minority regimepossesses either the will or the capacity to bring about afundamental change of South Africa,'' said the statement, releasedin Lusaka, Zambia.   But blacks might be willing to sit down and talk if de Klerktakes the preliminary steps they have demanded _ freeing Mandela,legalizing the ANC, lifting the emergency and curbs on politicalactivity.   The most powerful black moderate, Zulu leader MangosuthuButhelezi, said he was convinced de Klerk intended to move forward.   He called on blacks to ``move away from the weak position ofrevolution and internal violence, which can never bring victory fordemocracy, and move toward the politics of negotiation.''   An indication of the flux in South Africa came last week in aneditorial in the Kenya Times, a newspaper published by Kenya'sruling party that customarily depicts the white government inPretoria as evil and racist.   ``One still needs to avoid celebrating,'' it said. ``One needstime to see whether the de Klerk government will make significantfollow-ups to these promising beginnings. ... But if this is a signof things to come, then all of us need to encourage the president.''</TEXT></DOC>
