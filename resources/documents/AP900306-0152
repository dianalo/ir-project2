His government proposed a parliamentary resolution, to beintroduced Thursday, saying a united Germany should sign a treatywith Poland declaring that the right of Poles ``to live in secureborders will not now or in the future be questioned by us Germans.''   After a Cabinet meeting where ministers discussed disagreementsover his handling of the border issue, Kohl said: ``The things thatburdened us are cleared away.''   In Warsaw, the Polish Foreign Ministry said there had been``clear progress,'' but talks were needed about a border treaty.   Mikhail S. Gorbachev welcomed the ``corrections'' in Kohl'sposition, the Soviet news agency Tass quoted the Soviet presidentas saying after meeting in Moscow with Hans Modrow, the Communistpremier of East Germany.   Kohl had been criticized for his reluctance to state clearly,presumably in an effort to preserve the conservative vote inecember elections, that a reunified Germany would not questionPoland's western border.   He had insisted repeatedly that only the leadership of a unitedGermany could make such a promise about Polish territory, roughlyone-third of which was part of Germany before the war.   The chancellor's pronouncements caused unease in Poland, theSoviet Union, United States and elsewhere as Kohl soughtinternational support for bringing East and West Germany togetherinto a single nation.   His statements also created trouble at home. The Free Democrats,his coalition partners, joined the opposition Social Democrats insaying his position jeopardized the chances of unification.   On Friday, he exacerbated the problem by demanding that anytreaty recognizing Poland's current borders be linked to pledges bythe Poles to honor a 1953 decision to waive any war reparations,and to a renewal of Poland's 1989 promise to guarantee the rightsof its German minority.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his Free Democratsagreed with Poland that Kohl must clarify his position on thesensitive border issue.   After a meeting Tuesday between Kohl and Genscher, their secondin two days, Free Democrat official Torsten Wolfgramm said thechancellor had abandoned his demand that Polish assurancesaccompany a border treaty.   ``It is completely clear,'' he said. ``A treaty would containonly the border question.''   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, also indicated a treatywould concern only the border.   Silesia and East Prussia were awarded to Poland and the SovietUnion, respectively, at the Potsdam conference of 1945. That led tothe expulsion of 12 million Germans, and at least 2 million died inthe process.   Genscher was born in what now is East Germany. The foreignminister has made clear he and his party are willing, in return forreunification, to give up all claims to the territory lost toPoland.   Seiters said the parliamentary resolution would recommenddeclarations of respect for Poland's western border by theparliaments of both Germanys, to be made after the East Germanelections March 18.   Once Germany was united, he said, the government would make atreaty with Poland guaranteeing its borders.   Gorbachev warned against any attempt by a reunited Germany tochange borders drawn at the end of World War II.   ``Naturally, the inviolability of postwar borders is the mainissue in this respect,'' he said in Moscow. ``To use Germanreunification to reanimate revanchist plans would be to pursue anirresponsible policy fraught with very serious consequences.''   The Bonn newspaper Die Welt quoted President Wojciech Jaruzelskiof Poland as saying prolonging the border debate could ``create anatmosphere which overshadows everything, and which can complicateeverything positive for our relations.''   It quoted Jaruzelelski as saying, when asked whether he fearedGerman reunification: ``Yes and no. I worry as a Pole and Europeanbecause of historical experiences. The position of a mighty power,a dominance, could lead to this position being somehow used at thecost of others.''   On the other hand, Jaruzelski said, he believes ``the Germansthemselves, the big powers and all European peoples, especially thePoles, will do everything so that a united Germany will be aconstructive element in Europe.''   Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, began World WarII.   The newspaper telexed excerpts of the interview to other newsorganizations in advance of publication, scheduled for Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
