The judges were guided by the Bill ofRights, prosecutorial abuses and a legal brief from the ACLU.That the defendant was Oliver North is a timely reminder thatoriginal-intent jurisprudence, not result-oriented activism,is the best guarantee of individual rights.   Mr. North's appeal should have been a no-brainer forjudges. The facts were simple. The Iran-Contra congressionalcommittee wanted Mr. North to testify in 1987 on livetelevision. As was his right, Mr. North invoked his FifthAmendment freedom from self-incrimination; no claim to anyconstitutional penumbras or emanations was needed. As wasCongress's privilege, it forced him to waive his rights inexchange for immunity from any later prosecution using thecoerced information. Independent counsel Lawrence Walshwarned Congress that such &quot;immunity would create serious --and perhaps insurmountable -- barriers to the prosecution ofthe immunized witness.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The trouble began two years and millions of prosecutorialdollars ago when Mr. Walsh ignored his own legal analysis andcharged Mr. North anyway. It was clear before trial that thememories of many witnesses were &quot;refreshed&quot; by Mr. North'scongressional testimony; one, Robert McFarlane, even got asecond round of testimony to Congress to respond to what Mr.North had said. The American Civil Liberties Union warned,&quot;there is no conceivable way this case can be tried free ofthe taint of the defendants' immunized testimony,&quot; that atrial would &quot;eviscerate the privilege againstself-incrimination&quot; and cause a &quot;gross miscarriage ofjustice.&quot;   In more than 200 pages of legal reasoning for the federalappeals court in Washington, Reagan-appointed Judges LaurenceSilberman and David Sentelle agreed with the ACLU, whileCarter-appointed Judge Patricia Wald dissented. The courtvacated the convictions pending a hearing &quot;witness-by-witness. . . line-by-line and item-by-item.&quot; Trial Judge GerhardGesell already has said many witnesses were hopelesslytainted. The appellate opinion stressed that the FifthAmendment means the &quot;government must occasionally decidewhich it values more: immunization (perhaps to dischargeinstitutional duties, such as congressional fact-finding andinformation dissemination) or prosecution.&quot;   Mr. Walsh may decide to appeal, but the reversal of themost famous criminal conviction in years and most expensiveever raises more doubts about the entire system ofindependent counsel. The ACLU hasn't been heard from yet, butmany critics have seen these special prosecutors -- createdby Congress to go after officials in the executive branch --as civil-liberty time bombs.   In layman's language, much of the appeals court ruling onthis point can be interpreted as Kaboom] One purpose of theFifth Amendment is &quot;to prevent the prosecutor fromtransmogrifying into the inquisitor, complete with thatofficer's most pernicious tool -- the power of the state toforce a person to incriminate himself.&quot; The court noted that&quot;we do not countenance political trials in this country&quot; andeven doubted whether the most serious charge on which Mr.North was convicted should have been brought. &quot;No one canseriously question that people constantly attempt, ininnumerable ways, to obstruct or impede congressionalcommittees,&quot; the court said, but we don't always assume thisamounts to a crime.   Judge Silberman's separate opinion was especially tough.He began by referring to the prosecution summary to the jury,which not only compared Mr. North to Hitler but also referredthree times to the Iran-Contra middlemen making a &quot;killing&quot;on the deal. Prosecutors wanted to show that money, not AbuNidal's threats, motivated the &quot;illegal gratuity&quot; of a$13,800 security fence for Mr. North's home. The problem wasthat Judge Gesell had barred any such description of theprofits without risking rebuttal testimony.   &quot;I consider the improper comments in the IC's closingargument to be egregious prosecutorial misconduct,&quot; JudgeSilberman wrote, &quot;because they were deliberate rather thaninadvertent.&quot; This was an example of how &quot;the IC wished, evento the extent of violating the agreed upon `rule ofengagement' of the trial, to impugn North's motives.&quot; It was&quot;severe misconduct&quot; to have &quot;coolly crafted&quot; such&quot;intentionally improper arguments.&quot;   Judge Silberman said this alone would have been nearlyenough to reverse the convictions. He cited a precedent withlesser sanctions for prosecutorial misconduct, but &quot;ofcourse, one of the premises of that analysis is thatprosecutors employed by U.S. Attorneys work in something ofan ongoing relationship with federal judges so that a messagesent by one disciplinary action would act as a deterrent toother prosecutors.&quot; Whatever the merits of this argument forprosecutors who are not independent counsel, &quot;they areobviously inapplicable here due to the nature of theprosecutorial unit.&quot;   He also criticized President Reagan for his failure toinvoke executive privilege against Congress or Mr. Walsh. &quot;Icompletely fail to see how an ex-President can give answersto a prosecutor who is independent of any presidentialsupervision,&quot; Judge Silberman wrote, &quot;and yet assertexecutive privilege over the same or similar material whensought by a defendant.&quot; This is especially true because Mr.North was convicted on &quot;criminal statutes (never beforeemployed as here) and his defense is that he was lawfullydoing the President's bidding&quot; in an area, foreign policy,&quot;at the core of the chief executive's constitutionalresponsibility.&quot;   This was not the first time Judge Silberman has critiquedthe problems with independent counsel. In a case in January,1988, involving former Independent Counsel Alexia Morrison,he dismissed congressionally controlled prosecutors asunconstitutional. His opinion, reversed by the Supreme Court,would have saved everyone here a lot of trouble.   Targets such as Mr. North face prosecutors with unlimitedtime and funds to pursue charges no matter how insignificant.&quot;The independent counsel is cut off from the accumulated loreand wisdom of career Department of Justice officials,&quot; JudgeSilberman wrote in his earlier opinion. &quot;A case that seemsstrong and important when viewed in isolation may look weakor trivial when measured against past cases or in relation tobroader considerations.&quot; He concluded, &quot;This is no abstractdispute concerning the doctrine of separation of powers. Therights of individuals are at stake.&quot;   Civil libertarian conservativism is a natural in an age ofpolitical prosecutions, independent counsel and RICO. Thegood news is that when President Bush made his list ofpossible replacements for Justice Brennan, Judge Silbermanfinished second runner-up for the job and is a likelyfrontrunner for future vacancies.</TEXT></DOC>
