Quayle also met with a top opposition leader who says thegovernment is waging a campaign against dissent. U.S. officials saidprivately that Quayle told South Korean officials to respect humanrights.   The vice president also discussed South Korea's trade surpluswith the United States, which has caused friction between the twogovernments. Washington wants South Korea to lift restrictions onU.S. imports.   Quayle said the Bush administration remained committed to keepingU.S. forces in South Korea at existing levels despite calls by someU.S. lawmakers for troop cuts or a phased withdrawal.   Washington has 43,000 troops in South Korea under a mutualdefense treaty.   ``Our commitment to Korea's security remains unwavering. U.S.forces will remain in Korea as long as our two nations want them andas long as they can contribute to peace and stability,'' Quayle saidin a speech to the Korean Newspaper Editors Association.   Quayle claimed North Korea poses a threat to South Korea'ssecurity and the Soviet Union has been helping to bolster thenorth's military capability with advanced new weapons. He saidSoviet aid to Pyongyang cast doubt on Moscow's claims to want peaceand stability in the region.   ``The north (Korea) retains an extraordinary willingness to useforce and terrorism against the south,'' he said.   Radical students staged scattered protests against Quayle's visitfor a second day. About 50 students chanted ``Get out Quayle'' atSungkyunkwan University in Seoul but did not clash with police.   About 400 students yelling anti-American slogans battled riotpolice with firebombs and rocks at Kyongbok University in thecentral city of Taeju, police said.   Quayle assured President Roh Tae-woo and other South Koreanleaders in private meetings that the Bush Administration will keepits forces in South Korea, U.S. officials said. Some U.S. lawmakershave called for troop cuts, saying South Korea is capable ofdefending itself.   South Korean leaders insist U.S. forces are vital in preventing aNorth Korean attack. But dissident groups have been calling for theimmediate withdrawal of U.S. troops and an end to close ties withWashington.   Quayle, on the first leg of an Asian trip that will also take himto Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia, also praised the Koreanpeople for their efforts to build a democracy after years ofauthoritarian rule. He praised Roh for helping bring in broaddemocratic reforms.   U.S. officials, who declined to be named, said Quayle urged SouthKorean officials privately to respect human rights and avoid abusesof past regimes. The United States has expressed concern over thearrests of hundreds of anti-government dissidents in recent months.   Two dissidents, Kim Dong-gil and Park Hyung-kyu, were invited tohave breakfast with Quayle along with a selection of other Korean``opinionmakers.'' The dissidents criticized the Roh government atthe meeting with Quayle, but U.S. officials would give no details.   Quayle also met the leaders of the top three opposition partiesat the National Assembly, including Kim Dae-jung, who has beenindicted on charges of not reporting an opposition lawmaker's secrettrip to North Korea.   Kim contends the charges are an attempt by the government todiscredit him and cripple the opposition.   Quayle also discussed trade with Roh and other government leadersas part of attempts to resolve friction between the two nations overSeoul's huge trade surplus with Washington. The United States wantsfree access to South Korea for its exports.   The United States intervened to aid South Korea when it wasattacked by North Korea in 1950 at the start of the Korean War. U.S.forces remained in South Korea after the war ended in 1953.</TEXT></DOC>
