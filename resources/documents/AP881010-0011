Nationally, crime levels in the United States rose 1.8 percentin 1987, ending a five-year decline, the Bureau of JusticeStatistics reported Sunday.   The number of criminal victimizations rose some 613,000 in 1987to more than 34.7 million, with increases compared to 1986 in theamount of both personal and household crime.   Even with the increase over 1986, there were 16 percent fewercrimes last year than in 1981, the peak year for crime with 41.5million criminal victimizations, said Joseph Bessette, the bureau'sacting director.   In 1986, the number of crimes hit the lowest level in the15-year history of the government's national crime survey, 34.1million.   Last year, the number of personal crimes rose nearly 250,000 or1.4 percent from 1986 to just over 19 million, with increases inall four categories of rape, robbery, assault and theft.   The amount of household crime rose by nearly 360,000 or 2.3percent to 15.7 million, with increases in burglary, larceny andmotor vehicle theft.   Reagan administration officials have tried to depict declines asa result of sterner law enforcement and a more cooperative public.Some academic experts analyzing the data have stressed that thesize of the most crime-prone age group, those in their middle tolate teens, has grown smaller in the 1980s.   The numbers of personal crimes per 1,000 people last year were125 in the West, 101 in the Midwest, 91 in the South and 71 in theNortheast. The household crime figures per 1,000 residents were 223in the West, 166 in the Midwest, 179 in the South and 116 in theNortheast.
