Under a fixed-mix plan, a set percentage of the investment is put in each of several asset categories -- foreign and domestic stocks, bonds, and real estate, for instance -- using no-load mutual funds to minimize transaction costs. Then at the end of each year, the investor adjusts the holdings, selling some of the fund shares that have gone up in value and buying more of those that have declined, so that each fund has the same proportion of the total investment as at the start.    &quot;With this approach, you don't hit a home run,&quot; says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;Instead you hit lots of singles and doubles.&quot;    Larry Biehl, of Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm, says that in the 22 years through the end of 1987, a fixed-mix recommended by his firm would have had an average annual return of about 10%, based on a simulation using several broad indexes. That would have topped the average annual return of 8.9% for the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index and 7.4% for professional money managers in that period, he says. Another advantage of this approach is that it has less volatility than investing solely in U.S. stocks, he adds.    It works &quot;like a carousel,&quot; Mr. Biehl says. &quot;Every year, some horses are up, and some horses are down.&quot;    The fixed-mix strategy isn't without critics, however. &quot;No mechanical system will be a winner over time,&quot; says Gilford Babcock, a finance professor at the University of Southern California. The proper balance today &quot;won't be the proper balance three years from now,&quot; he says.    Donald Evans, a South Laguna Beach, Calif., investment manager, dismisses the fixed-mix approach as &quot;like eating a meal of pablum.&quot; Mr. Evans says he prefers market timing, in which the portfolio mix is varied based on the market's expected direction. Some mutual-fund investors who try to time the market move their money back and forth among stock, bond and money-market funds.    The fixed mix also is an easy way to distribute funds among different types of assets. &quot;In the wake of the crash, people are rediscovering a basic concept: the need to be diversified within and among market categories,&quot; says John Markese, research director of the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.    The fixed mix recommended by Mr. Biehl's firm divides an investor's money equally among five asset categories: domestic stocks, domestic bonds, international stocks, money-market instruments and real estate.    But others say the percentages should be varied to take into account differences in investors' objectives. Considering the current volatility of the stock market, for instance, risk-averse clients would be better off putting a larger amount in money-market funds, says Charles D. Haines, a Birmingham, Ala., financial planner.    Some proponents of the approach recommend modifying the proportions slightly from time to time to take advantage of economic cycles -- but not enough to be classified as market timing. Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Chicago, suggests varying a mix of seven no-load funds, spreading the money among stocks in small U.S. companies, stocks in large U.S. companies, international bonds, international stocks, U.S. bonds, gold and money-market instruments.    The Bailard Biehl firm varies the proportions somewhat in managing money for wealthy individuals and pension funds. But Mr. Biehl says he recommends the equal-weighting approach for investors who can't afford to hire a money manager and don't want to put their money into an asset-allocation mutual fund.    Not everyone thinks investors are willing to stick to a fixed mix. William Hiss, a Santa Clara, Calif., broker, doubts many people have the discipline needed to continue the program when stocks are either soaring or falling. &quot;The more I see of how people react, the more I think the herd instinct is too strong,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Biehl and others say that is precisely why the fixed-mix strategy is helpful. &quot;This approach takes the emotion out of investing,&quot; Mr. Biehl says. </TEXT></DOC>
