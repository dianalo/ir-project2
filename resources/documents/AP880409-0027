But while Jackson said Friday his campaign would ``continue toheal relationships'' with the Jewish community, aides said he won'thave time to meet with Jewish leaders concerned that he isanti-Israel.   In the Republican race, meanwhile, Vice President George Bushhit the campaign trail Friday for the first time since Bob Dolequit the race and Pat Robertson switched his campaign into low gear.   On a visit to Fort Worth, Texas, Bush said he was delighted withthe slim competition he faces for Republican delegates and``wouldn't trade'' places with the three Democrats scrambling fortheir party's nomination.   Nevertheless, he said he wasn't banking on Democratic infightingto pave his way to the Oval Office.   ``I wish I thought the Democrats would have a unity problem butI don't think they will,'' Bush said. ``I'm not counting on theblood on the floor that exists at this moment to carry over andcause the Democrats to hemorrhage to death.''   Back in New York, Jackson campaign aide Gerald Austin said hisboss would not accept a request to meet with the Jewish CommunityRelations Council because ``we've already answered all thesequestions. I don't see why we have to go to a meeting to answer allthe questions again.''   The questions revolve around Jackson's use of the phrase``Hymietown'' during his 1984 campaign, his past association withNation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has called Judaism a``gutter religion,'' and his closeness to the Palestinian cause.   Jackson himself had plenty of conciliatory words for Jewishvoters as he campaigned across New York and Long Island in advanceof the state's April 19 primary.   Visiting the posh Sardi's restaurant in Manhattan, Jacksonrecalled the days when ``it was commonplace to see signs that said`blacks and Jews and dogs are not welcome.'''   ``Our commitment is to end any vestiges of racism, ofanti-Semitism, or sexism,'' he said. ``We've sent a message no onecan miss.''   Dukakis and Gore, meanwhile, both had harsh words for theeffectiveness of the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts, andpledged to do better if elected.   Speaking at a senior citizens center on Long Island, Dukakispromised he'd ``wage a real war, not a phony war, on drugs.''   ``In Latin America, the gravest threat to our security comes notfrom the Sandinistas, but from drugs,'' the Massachusetts governorsaid earlier in a speech at St. John's University.   Gore was advancing a similar theme.   ``The administration declared a war against drugs and drugswon,'' the Tennessee senator told an audience on Long Island.``They've got to say yes to funding for drug programs.''   The 255 Democratic delegates at stake in New York's primary makethe state a crucial battleground for Dukakis, Jackson and Gore.None thus far are close to the 2,082 delegates needed to gain theDemocratic nomination.   Dukakis holds a slight lead, with 745.05 delegates, comparedwith Jackson's 708.55, and Gore's 395.8. Illinois Sen. Paul Simon,with 171.5 delegates, remains on the candidates' roster, but hassuspended all campaign activities.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose endorsement has been courtedunsuccessfully by the Democratic candidates, revealed he'd alreadyvoted by absentee ballot for one of the contenders, but refused tosay which one.   Cuomo said he was discussing making campaign appearances for allthree active Democratic candidates, as time permits.   ``I'll go anywhere with them,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
