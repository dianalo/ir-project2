After reviewing its A-minus rating of New York City's $13billion in outstanding general obligation bonds, Standard andamp; PoorsCorp. could decide to lower the rating.   ``I'm confident we are going to satisfy them that we are incontrol,'' Mayor David Dinkins said at a City Hall pressconference. ``We have a plan. We are going to meet that gap.''   The mayor has projected a $1.4 billion budget deficit for nextyear.   Sandamp;P said it was reevaluating the city's payroll burden in lightof a weakening economy that leads to lower tax revenues.   State Comptroller Edward Regan said Sandamp;P's move appeared to bebased on a perception of economic crisis, rather than reality.   ``The city is not on the verge of an economic disaster,'' Regansaid. ``It's a cyclical downturn with an erosion of revenue, butthat can be handled. The problem is that this year's budget was toolarge to begin with.''   An A-rating from Sandamp;P means the agency believes the city has astrong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds, althoughthat ability is more susceptible to economic downswings. A plus orminus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within thecatagory.   The next step lower is a BBB-rating, which signifies thatadverse conditions make it more likely the city will have troublepaying interest and principal.   Lower ratings make it more expensive to borrow money in the bondmarket since investors usually demand higher yields for the riskierdebt.   City Council President Andrew Stein said it was inconceivablethat the administration could give teachers a 5.5 percent pay raiseon Monday ``and then announce on Thursday that it was planning for15,000 layoffs. This is not fiscal leadership. It is fiscalfolly.''   Dinkins said the city has met past financial difficulties andthat, ``I can assure Standard and Poor's, taxpayers, noteholdersand the citizens of this city that my administration will continuethis tradition of responding fully and quickly to the difficultiesa deteriorating economy and rising costs pose for our budget.''</TEXT></DOC>
