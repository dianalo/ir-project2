LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At an age when most men would consider wakingup in the morning an accomplishment, Isaac A. Long gets his kicksby creating headlines in financial publications around the world.   The 90-year-old chairman emeritus of Southwest Bank of St. Louishas made a career out of taking the lead in cutting the primelending rate and watching other banks follow in his tracks.   Until Nov. 8, Long was batting .900 as a bellwether. But otherbanks didn't match him that time and he became news becauseSouthwest had to backtrack three weeks later and readjust its primefrom 10 percent to 10.5 percent.   Considering that it was the first time in at least 10 years thathe has had to retreat, Long took it well.   ``We're still batting about .875,'' he said. ``That's still apretty good average.''   In fact, Long said, the move was well worth it.   ``What we really did was give our commercial customers aChristmas bonus a little early,'' he said. ``We feel it was anexcellent investment from an advertising and public relationsstandpoint.''   The prime rate is important because it is used by many banks asa basis for determining rates on a wide range of other loans,including highly popular home-equity loans. A drop in the primewould be followed by lower interest rates for loans to consumersand small businesses.   Speculation has persisted in the past few weeks that banks wouldcut the prime rate because their own borrowing costs have declined,a result of recent credit-easing moves by the Federal Reserve, thenation's central bank, to forestall an economic downturn. As ofthis past week, however, neither Long's bank nor any other appearedwilling to lower the prime rate.   Using the year 1989 as an example of Long's influence on thebanking industry, the prime rate rested at 11.5 percent untilFriday, June 2.   That's when Long announced Southwest was dropping its prime to11 percent. On Monday, the next work day, all the major banks inthe country followed.   On Friday, July 7, Long again rattled the industry's chains anddropped his prime to 10.5 percent. The following Monday, only NewYork's Chase Manhattan Bank followed Southwest's lead. It wasn'tuntil the 29th that Bank of America joined them and it was two moredays before the other big banks fell into step.   Then came Nov. 8 and the cut that separated Southwest from therest of the pack.   ``I.A. Long sort of hung himself out there to dry,'' said RayWorseck, chief economist at A.G. Edwards andamp; Son, Inc. a St. Louisinvestment firm. ``I think the optimists got a little bit ahead ofthemselves on this.''   Long said one of the reasons he erred was the difficulty ininterpreting the behavior of the Federal Reserve, whichhistorically has acted with great secrecy in order to keepfinancial markets stable.   But the nation's central bank can send subtle signals about itspossible intentions, partly by control over the amount of moneyavailable to lend. That control sometimes can be seen in thebehavior of the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loansbetween banks.   The rate had fallen below 8.5 percent in November, convincingLong that the Fed was easing and it was time for a prime-rate cut.Then the Fed appeared to suddenly reverse itself and the federalfunds rate rose to 8.75 on Nov. 28, forcing Long to backtrack.   Some New York bankers may have enjoyed seeing Long with egg onhis face, but the old veteran says his aim, ever since he began hisrate crusade in the 1970s, has never been to make the big bankslook bad.   ``Our policy, our ambition, is not to upstage the New Yorkbanks,'' Long said. ``Our customers are very appreciative of thefact that they don't have to wait for what banks in New York orChicago do. We make our own decisions.''   Those decisions, he said, are based on lengthy analysis. He saidSouthwest looks at trends rather than specific economic indicatorsand he said he prefers to look at a six month period.   Long broke into banking with the Royal Bank of Canada in NewYork in 1920. After organizing the first branch bank in Virginia in1922, he came to the National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis in 1927and has never left the area.   Named president of Southwest Bank in 1953, Long soon became itslargest stockholder. He often is called Col. Long, a title that hasstuck since he served a term as chairman of the St. Louis PoliceBoard.   ``The bank has had the same location and the same name for 69years,'' said Long. The bank's president, Edward C. Berra, and avice chairman, Fred A. Giacoma, were both hired by Long 29 yearsago. Long finally sold controlling interest in the institution in1984.   ``I think it's interesting that every time we get in the newsfor being a national leader they call us `a small bank,''' Longsaid. ``But if you look at the figres, we're in the top 5 percentnationally and we're the largest independent bank in Missouri.''   As chairman emeritus, Long isn't involved in day-to-dayoperations of the bank, but he remains active and is considered anauthority on interest rates.   ``I enjoy being here every day, keeping in touch with what'sgoing on,'' he said. ``It's really a lot of fun. I attribute mylongivity to having steady employment and my wife of 51 years.''   As for retirement, Long said, ``I haven't given it a thought.I'll worry about it when I get closer to retirement age.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Dec. 31.</NOTE></DOC>
