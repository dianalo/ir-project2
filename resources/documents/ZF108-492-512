(DBS) now official, it would appear the company has a lot on its plate.andO;The first step is to sharpen its focus, says Pierre Donaldson, formervice-president and general manager of Management Science America (MSA) CanadaInc. who now serves as president of DBS Canada.andM;&quot;I think going into 1990, the customer relationship is becoming more and moreimportant,&quot; says Donaldson.andP;  &quot;We have to be closer to our customers.andP;  Theyhave to see the added value of our services.&quot;andM;Donaldson was appointed following the merger of Atlanta-based MSA with Dun andamp;Bradstreet Corp.'s McCormack andamp; Dodge Ltd. software subsidiary of Natick,Mass.andP;  When Donaldson took office in Canada, he decided to run a &quot;flatorganization&quot; with five different business units: the sales organization,professional services, finance and administration, customer service andmarketing.andP;  The emphasis, he says, will be on providing professional servicesand customer support.andM;&quot;We're no longer just selling the software and providing minimal support,&quot;Donaldson comments.andP;  &quot;We're offering project management ...andP;  technicalconsulting.andP;  We want to extend our scope of responsibility.andM;&quot;Maintenance is a good source of revenue for DBS and that source of revenuehelps us invest in Randamp;D -- an area that is critical.&quot;andM;The new company's major research project is development of a single productline that fits under IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  Donaldsonpredicts the SAA line will be available in the late 1992, 1993 time frame.andO;Until then both product lines from MSA and McCormack andamp; Dodge Systems CanadaLtd. will be supported as the E series and M series respectively.andM;&quot;Our challenge through the merger is to improve our coverage,&quot; saysDonaldson.andP;  &quot;Which product line we recommend in a sale will depend on thevertical market and the customer requirement.&quot;andM;In a recent report, Computer Intelligence of La Jolla, Calif.andP;  notes thecombined entity of MSA and Mandamp;D &quot;will command more than 50 per cent share inall of the markets in which it competes, except for the manufacturingsoftware segment.&quot;andM;The study also indicates the fact that MSA led in all of the categories wherethe two companies were direct competitors before the merger.andP;  However, thegeneral trend had been for Mandamp;D to gain share while MSA had lost ground.andM;In Canada, Donaldson stresses that both products will be maintained, withconversion tools available to migrate to the new SAA version when it isreleaseRd.andP;  &quot;There's a major emphasis corporate-wide ...andP;  to move as fast aswe can under SAA,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;It's a major task, but we think to bring thosetwo great organizations together, we'll be able to come up with an evenstronger offering then each one of them would have done had they stayed ontheir own.&quot;andM;Regarding staffing decisions, Donaldson maintains they were not influenced inany way.andP;  &quot;Throughout the merger the only area where there was someredundancy was in management -- we may have lost five or six people,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;When I was appointed I looked at who are the best people to representus, I didn't look at who's MSA, who's Mandamp;D -- I looked at the individual.&quot;andM;The Canadian corporation has been formed by 90 MSA employees and 62 Mandamp;Demployees.andP;  Former MSA director Paula Hucko has been named director of sales;Don Schafheitlin, previously with MSA, will act as director of professionalservices; former MSA director of finance Bruce MacInnis will continue toserve in that capacity for DBS; and Doug Hobbs, Mandamp;D's Canadian marketingmanager will also retain that position in the new firm.andM;Through offering more in the way of professional services, Donaldson says hehopes to maintain a 20 per cent growth rate for DBS in its first year.andP;  Buthe's the first to admit a necessary step is to broaden product offeringsoutside the scope of mainframe software.andM;In addition to SAA, DBS will also be looking at Unix.andP;  &quot;Unix is a bigmarketplace,&quot; comments Donaldson.andP;  &quot;I feel confident that with the backing ofDandamp;B, we'll have the backing when the time is right to move into thatmarketplace.andM;&quot;We're moving slowly but surely out of the mainframe marketplace because werealize there's limited opportunity there.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
