A study by the University of Nebraska Medical School foundthat transplant costs for patients considered at high riskfor the procedure were four times greater than for low-riskpatients, and that people in the high-risk group were muchmore likely to die within a year of the operation.</LP><TEXT>   Because of a shortage of livers available for transplant,donated organs are apportioned to patients based on a scoringsystem. The system gives preference to those most severelyill.   &quot;As the number of candidates for organs increases, onlythe sickest patients are going to get transplanted,&quot; saysByers W. Shaw Jr., director of transplantation at theUniversity of Nebraska Medical Center. He said the studydoesn't mean severely ill patients should be deniedtransplants, but he noted that the current policy hasconsequences for those whose liver disease is in earlierstages.   &quot;We are placing patients that are better risk candidatesat a distinct disadvantage in the competition for theavailable {organs,}&quot; he said.   About 55,000 people die annually from liver disease. Lastyear, 2,656 people had liver transplants in the U.S., at anaverage first-year cost of about $235,000, according to theUnited Network for Organ Sharing, a Richmond, Va.,organization that administers the nation's organ procurementsystem. Currently, 1,466 people are on the waiting list for aliver transplant.   A second report, by E. Rolland Dickson, professor ofmedicine at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., found that arisk score based on four factors -- age, two simple bloodtests, and the condition of the spleen -- can assess thestatus of a certain liver disease and predict how long apatient will live without a transplant. Family doctors coulduse the risk score to determine when to refer a patient to atransplant specialist, Dr. Dickson says. Earlier referralscould improve chances for better results from a transplant,he said.   Dr. Dickson's report was based on 426 patients with a formof liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis, aninflammation of the bile ducts. He and his colleagues havedeveloped a similar risk scale for primary biliary cirrhosis,a form of cirrhosis of the liver.   The Nebraska study was based on the experiences of 32patients who were at least 60 years old. While the number ofpatients was small, the results are in line with earlierfindings from an examination of larger numbers of patients ofall ages.   Dr. Shaw said that one of 15 patients, or about 6%, in thelow-risk group died within one year after the operation,while 71% of the high-risk group died, most of them withinthree months of the procedure. The low-risk patients averagedfive days in intensive care and incurred hospital costsaveraging $74,000. The high-risk group spent an average of 54days in intensive care and their costs amounted to an averageof $320,000.   Both reports were delivered this week at the annualDigestive Disease Week conference in New Orleans.</TEXT></DOC>
