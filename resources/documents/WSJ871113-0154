Behind the shiny metal walls, George Rigopoulos is standing among vats of brown gravy and boiled onions and talking with Sen. Paul Simon.    &quot;He seems old-fashioned, conservative, from the 1950s,&quot; Mr. Rigopoulos, who wears the white smock and paper cap of a diner cook, says after the senator departs. &quot;It's a conservative look.&quot;    A day earlier Mr. Simon was at the other end of this snowy state, site of the first 1988 presidential primary, telling a noontime audience of his opposition to government restrictions on abortion, comparing the leadership of South Africa with Hitler and expressing skepticism of the anti-missile shield of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.    &quot;I'm an old fashioned liberal,&quot; beams Marilyn Minter, a Durham homemaker and political activist who heard the Illinois Democrat speak at the University of New Hampshire, &quot;and when I hear these things it's almost too good to be true.&quot;    It wasn't until early this month, when he became the hot candidate of the Democratic race, that the elusive political philosophy of Mr. Simon came under scrutiny in his party. Until now, he and his trademark bow tie and his endearing homilies were regarded as little more than harmless curiosities, adding to the color of the race but not defining its shape.    But in recent weeks increasing numbers of voters -- conservatives like Mr. Rigopoulos and liberals like Mrs. Minter -- have begun embracing the campaign of a man who is arguing he can balance the budget and underwrite a broad long-term health care program and an $8 billion jobs program at the same time.    Already these kinds of contradictions, coupled with a liberal image that may not prove popular in the South, are prompting some Democrats to accuse Mr. Simon of &quot;Democratic voodoo&quot; and to worry that the party would suffer an electoral disaster if he heads the ticket. &quot;There's a burden on every Democratic candidate to demonstrate he can be competitive,&quot; says Mark Siegel, a member of the Democratic National Committee, &quot;and Simon hasn't yet made the case.&quot;    Even so, the campaign that began as an effort to revive the stylish politics of John Kennedy -- the model for the two fallen candidates, Gary Hart and Joseph Biden -- has been transformed into a race to replicate the authenticity of Harry Truman. The movement is so dramatic that Mr. Simon, who entered the race against the entreaties of some of his most loyal advisers, now is regarded at the head of the pack in Iowa, which in three months holds the first presidential caucuses, and may emerge as the principal alternative here to Gov. Michael Dukakis of nearby Massachusetts.    &quot;He has a funny kind of charisma,&quot; says Mayor L. Edward Reyor of this small city in the Monadnock Mountains at the far southwestern corner of the state. &quot;He has a way about him. He's one of us.&quot;    The slight bearing and heavy glasses of Sen. Simon, which ordinarily might seem somewhat out of place in the television age, are part of his curious appeal, particularly in the small towns and rural crossroads of Iowa and New Hampshire where the word &quot;slick&quot; is usually applied to wintry roads and not to people. He is, in a phrase, fashionably unfashionable.    &quot;People want someone who is going to play it straight, to level with them,&quot; he says as he moves in a van across this state. &quot;People understand I'm not just holding my fingers to the wind, that there's a base of conviction.&quot;    His image as the modest country editor of a half-century ago isn't his only incongruity, however. He is a vigorous champion of the labor movement and yet he believes a split minimum wage providing for a lower rate for young people is worth trying as an experiment. He calls himself a &quot;pay-as-you-go Democrat&quot; but, besides the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Simon is the only Democrat who is a strong advocate for major new domestic spending.    &quot;The public is ready to spend money on education and public welfare and public works projects,&quot; says Jeffrey Cox, a University of Iowa historian who is Mr. Simon's coordinator in Johnson County, Iowa. &quot;At least in Iowa, he's tapped into a sympathetic vein of public opinion.&quot; Mayor Thomas Hart of Davenport, Iowa, another Simon backer, adds: &quot;I don't feel the need to apologize for saying we ought to spend again.&quot;    His principal domestic initiative is a jobs bill patterned on the Depression-era Works Progress Administration and designed to provide government jobs to &quot;those unable to find work in the private sector.&quot; Mr. Simon envisions a series of federal public-works programs to construct new transportation, water and urban-landscaping projects. The cost, he says, would be $5 billion in fiscal 1989, rising to $8 billion in fiscal 1990, and would be paid for primarily from savings on welfare and unemployment-compensation programs.    He's also proposing to extend Medicare health insurance to cover long-term health care for the chronically ill, claiming that it can be financed by lifting the cap on the Medicare payroll tax, an adjustment affecting only those earning more than $45,000. At the same time, he's talking about restoring the revenue-sharing program, which cost nearly $7 billion a year at its height before being eliminated because of budget pressures in the Reagan years. This isn't the extent of Sen. Simon's proposals, however; he's even considering offering tax incentives to companies giving bonuses to employees fluent in a foreign language.    Despite these additional costs, he's supporting the balanced-budget amendment and vows to eliminate the deficit three years after taking office.    It doesn't add up.    Jobs plans similar to Mr. Simon's plan, for example, have been tried several times over the past two decades, seldom with success. &quot;The welfare population is hard to get into jobs at levels that would repay the costs,&quot; says the Brookings Institution's Alice Rivlin, a Democrat who headed the Congressional Budget Office. Few experts, moreover, believe the health program can be underwritten only by taxing the wealthy.    He proposes spending reductions primarily on the defense side of the budget. He advocates new taxes only as a &quot;last resort,&quot; and doesn't provide specifics that would direct the nation to a balanced budget.    But Mr. Simon is spending his campaign days talking about honesty and independence as much as about budget questions, his opposition to aid to the Nicaraguan rebels and his proposal for a halt to nuclear warhead testing. And he seems at home shivering in a small semicircle around the flagpole at an American Legion post, woodsmoke in the air, talking with World War I veterans and placing a wreath at the base of a stone memorial.    &quot;People don't vote primarily on the basis of issues,&quot; he says. &quot;They vote on a sense of leadership. They want independence, someone who has a sense of direction and purpose and who identifies with them. My position on Contra aid isn't something that's going to lose an election.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
