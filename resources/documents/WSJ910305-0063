Secretary of State James Baker has sought to pare Israel'sinitial request of nearly $1 billion, but continues to meetresistance from Israel and its supporters in Congress. A U.S.offer promising $500 million in direct aid was unexpectedlyrejected by Israel last night, and the give-and-take betweenthe two allies is a striking portrait of the intense politicssurrounding the issue.</LP><TEXT>   Though the cash aid is the most important element, Israelwould also benefit from taking over several of the U.S.Patriot missile batteries used in its defense during the warwith Iraq. To keep down the cash part, the administration hasemphasized the value of the Patriot system, but Mr. Baker hasalso sought to use the talks to win an agreement on whenIsrael will seek future loan guarantees from the U.S. Facingan influx of Soviet refugees, the Jerusalem government hasdiscussed the need for billions of dollars in new credit tomeet employment and housing needs, but the administration hastried to block any such move this year, according to peoplefamiliar with the negotiations.   The negotiations are sensitive -- both because of Mr.Baker's Mideast trip this week and Republican politics closerto home. The victory over Iraq has enhanced Washington'sstanding with Arab allies in the region, and theadministration wants to avoid the impression that the U.S. isreturning to what one official called a &quot;business as usual&quot;posture of financing Israel. While cautious about imposingany U.S. peace plan on the region, Mr. Baker wants tomaintain some leverage with Israel and is said to viewJerusalem's initial $1 billion cash request as excessive.   At the same time, the secretary's own political partywants to capitalize on the victory and the chill betweenIsrael's supporters and Democratic allies who opposed theJanuary war resolution. These same Democrats appear bent onmaking amends by backing new aid to Jerusalem, and ratherthan lose any political advantage, some of the Senate's mostfiscally conservative Republicans have joined in the bidding.   The issue could be joined today when the HouseAppropriations Committee is to take up two fiscal 1991supplemental-spending bills to cover the cost of the Iraq waras well as assorted expenditures related to the conflict. Thestrategy is to include the Israeli package -- and possiblyaid for Turkey -- as part of the second measure. By invokingemergency powers, President Bush would be able to exemptthese costs from the budget ceilings set last fall.</TEXT></DOC>
