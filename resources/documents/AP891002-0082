Seat</HEAD><DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Afghan rebels said today they willsend a delegation to New York to lobby for Afghanistan's seat atthe United Nations, which is now occupied by the Soviet-backedgovernment.   Najibullah Lafrie, information minister in the guerrillas'self-proclaimed government-in-exile, said the group also would meetwith U.S. State Department officials to discuss fighting the flowof heroin from war-torn Afghanistan.   The four-man delegation, led by the rebels' interior minister,Yunis Khalis, will be present for the U.N. General Assembly debateon Afghanistan in late October or early November, the informationminister said.   The Moslem rebels have yet to achieve any U.N. status.   Seven resistance parties based in Pakistan formed what they saidwas an interim government in February after the Soviet Unioncompleted its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.   The Marxist government in Kabul still controls major cities withheavy material support from Moscow, but the insurgents virtuallyrule the countryside.   Four Moslem countries officially recognize the rebel government.But the main backers of the rebels _ Pakistan and the United States_ do not because it doesn't include several guerrilla groups basedinside Afghanistan and in Iran.   The information minister said the rebel government would offerto help stop the flow of opium and its refined derivative, heroin,from Afghanistan.   ``Our government shall play an outstanding role in theelimination of the menace of drugs and narcotics,'' he said.   The rebels have denied allegations that they occasionally havetraded drugs for weapons in their 11-year-old fight to topple theKabul government.   Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan have a centuries-oldtradition of opium poppy cultivation.</TEXT></DOC>
