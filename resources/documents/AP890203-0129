His 17-hour visit, beginning Saturday night, caps a week ofhectic diplomatic efforts to avert more bloodshed as the Red Armycontinues its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Shevardnadze will be talking to officials of the Pakistanigovernment, which has backed and sheltered the most powerfulguerrilla forces fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backed regime.   ``We hope our talks with the Soviet leader will pave the way fora peaceful settlement, although the situation on the ground inAfghanistan is depressing,'' a Pakistani government spokesman saidthis week.   He was referring to bitter fighting between communist forces andMoslem guerrillas. Some of the worst reported attacks have occurredalong the main Soviet withdrawal route from Kabul north to theSoviet border.   Moscow signed a U.N. accord last spring providing for removal ofthe approximately 100,000 Soviet combat troops by Feb. 15.   Although the last units are said to be en route home, there stillare no prospects for peace between Kabul's communist government andtenacious Moslem insurgents armed by the United States, Pakistan andother Islamic countries.   All sides agree on the need for a settlement that will produce abroad-based government to succeed the current regime, which seizedpower in a bloody 1978 coup.   President Najib of Afghanistan insists that such a new governmentshould retain some of his officials.   However, the guerrillas consider the communists traitors forinviting the Soviets to intervene in December 1979 and refuse tonegotiate with them.   In addition, the guerrillas cannot agree among themselves on howto form a transitional regime leading to a post-war Islamic republicof Afghanistan.   The insurgents' seven major parties, Sunni Moslem groupsheadquartered in Pakistan, are at odds with Shiite Moslem insurgentgroups based in Iran over proportional repesentation in a grand``consultative council'' that is to lay groundwork for a newgovernment.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran flew to Pakistanearlier this week for two days of talks. When he departed Thursday,he said only that the anti-government forces of Afghanistan shouldwork together to restore peace.   In addition to backing the insurgents, Pakistan and Iran alsoshelter more than 5 million Afghan refugees.   Shevardnadze is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visitPakistan in more than 20 years. He initiated the trip himself, saida Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman on condition of anonymity.The spokesman did not disclose the agenda.</TEXT></DOC>
