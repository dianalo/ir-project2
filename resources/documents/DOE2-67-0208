<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0208 </DOCNO><TEXT>The solution of large, banded diagonally dominant or symmetric positivedefinite linear systems constitutes one of the most common computationaltasks associated with implementations of the finite element method inapplications such as fluid dynamics and structural analysis. Thus, designingmultiprocessor algorithms for solving large block tridiagonal systemsbecomes of paramount importance for efficient implementation of theseapplications on vector and parallel machines. The authors present suchschemes here, along with specific performance results on the AlliantFX/8 and CRAY X-MP 48. They particularly emphasize the speedups obtainedwith these schemes over popular direct band solvers. The developmentof a candidate scheme for the multicluster CEDAR machine is their goal.</TEXT></DOC>
