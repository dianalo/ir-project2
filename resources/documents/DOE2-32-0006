Thenew approach to radiobiological research has proved to be extremely fruitful.Some previously unknown types of structural disorders in DNA moleculehave been discovered, some repair genes isolated and their primary structureestablished, some aspects of radiation mutagenesis elucidated, and researchinto disiphering the molecular bases of neoplastic transformations ofexposed cells are being successfully investigated. The perspectives ofusing genetic engineering methods in radiobiology are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
