(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bic Corp. is confident about plans tomarket a $5 French spritz perfume alongside its ballpoint pens,throwaway razors and cigarette lighters, but some fragrance expertsthink the idea stinks.   Bic officially will inaugurate its new product next month in thesame retailers where it sells the other items, and an advertisingcampaign will start in early April, Bic spokeswoman Sharon DuPuysaid Friday.   The quarter-ounce spray perfumes _ to be called Jour and Nuit _will be offered at a price comparable to that of cologne, a muchless concentrated form of fragrance.   Bic, a subsidiary of Societe Bic of France, launched the perfumebusiness a year ago in France with a new $25 million factory.Firmenich, one of Europe's top four fragrance makers, is supplyingthe essences for Parfum Bic.   European sales have been strong, according to company officialsand cosmetic analysts.   In the United States, Parfum Bic will be sold in the usual Bicoutlets: drug stores, discount stores, supermarkets, conveniencestores.   ``The concept is vintage Bic. If you, as a consumer, have anopportunity to buy perfume for a price which is less than you mightspend on toilet water, would there be much reason not to?'' saidDavid Liebowitz, an analyst at American Securities in New York.   But others had doubts.   J.T. Botindari, fragrance buyer at Colonial Drug in Cambridge,Mass., calls the planned Parfum Bic a ``junky idea.'' He said thesuccess of the product will depend ``on how sophisticated your buyeris and whether he wants to buy perfume from a company that makeslighter fluid.''   Jay Salzman of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., the New York investmentfirm, said other failed efforts to market low-budget perfumesincluded one by Revlon in the early 1980s. He said one of theproblems is pilferage, and another is that $5 may be more than womenmay want to spend for such a product in a supermarket or conveniencestore.   ``If they are successful, they will be the first,'' Salzman said.``It's been tried. It's very tough. My visceral reaction is that, ifit is ultimately successful, it will be an uphill battle. It mightbe more expensive than Bic thinks.''   ``This is the same thing people told us about shavers,'' DuPuyresponded. ``No one has been able to combine this quality and thisprice and this packaging.''</TEXT></DOC>
