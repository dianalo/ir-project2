Long, a Sutro senior vice president, engaged in a short-selling scheme designed to drive it out of business.    Sutro, a unit of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., is an investment banking concern. Sutro promised a &quot;prompt investigation&quot; of the allegations. However, &quot;Sutro has a long history of ethical business practices&quot; and is &quot;confident&quot; the integrity of the company and Mr. Long will be upheld, said Susan Freund, Sutro's general counsel.    Occupational is seeking $90 million in damages. In its suit filed in federal district court here, Occupational alleged that Sutro and Mr. Long &quot;entered into a conspiracy to sell short&quot; Occupational's stock. Mr. Long, according to the suit, then sought to &quot;directly interfere with the company's operations and customer activities&quot; by spreading &quot;false charges&quot; among Occupational customers. Those charges included an allegation that &quot;Ouch's entire board of directors were 'crooks' . . . and that Ouch was on the verge of going out of business,&quot; Occupational said in a prepared statement.    A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock by an investor who hopes to make a profit by buying an equal number of shares later at a lower price to replace the borrowed stock.    Occupational, a provider of medical cost-containment programs marketed to insurance companies, blamed &quot;Mr. Long's actions&quot; for a battering of its stock price and flattening of earnings in recent months. Occupational traded as high as $14.87 a share last September but has slipped to as low as $4.87 a share last month. It closed at $6.25 a share yesterday, up 50 cents in national over-the-counter trading.    For the first nine months of 1987, Occupational had net income of $1.4 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $4.4 million. Net included a gain of $610,600, or nine cents a share, on tax-loss carry-forwards. A year earlier, Occupational had a loss of $251,711 on revenue of $612,631. </TEXT></DOC>
