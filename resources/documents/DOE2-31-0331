Theobjectives of the work are to determine the relationship between: therates of these processes; pyrolysis conditions; and easily measurableparticle properties such as density and composition of the municipalsolid waste from which the RDF was made. Initial studies have determinedlow temperature thermal conductivity, pyrolysis rates and product compositionunder a limited set of pyrolysis conditions for several representativeRDF compositions.</TEXT></DOC>
